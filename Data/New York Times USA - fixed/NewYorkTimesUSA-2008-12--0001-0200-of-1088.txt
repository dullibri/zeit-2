HEADLINE: City Pays Back $800 Million In Business Tax

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
New York City, grappling with the aftershocks of the global financial crisis, has been forced to refund more than $800 million to companies that overpaid their taxes this year based on expectations of a more robust business performance.
 The refunds -- three times the amount typically returned -- have triggered deep unease among city budget officials, who are already struggling with weakening revenue and face pressure to slash services and raise taxes. 
 They come as the city, according to the Bloomberg administration, faces a budget shortfall that is expected to climb to $4 billion over the next two years. And having to give back such a large amount of money is certainly going to make the situation even bleaker. 
 Each year, companies estimate their tax liabilities based largely on their performance in prior years. And because the first half of 2007 was so lucrative for many financial firms and other companies in New York, many prepaid millions of dollars more in taxes. But with revenues collapsing this year, companies owe the city much less in taxes. 
 In a departure from previous years, when the companies would simply instruct the city to apply any overpayment to subsequent tax bills, they are demanding the cash now.
 The amount the city must pay back is likely to surge again in the next two months, analysts who follow the city budget said, as companies stymied by tight credit markets scramble for additional money to pay for operating expenses and other needs.
 ''When you're trying to harness every shekel you've got, you start paying attention to everything,'' said Carol O'Cleireacain, a former finance commissioner and budget director under Mayor David N. Dinkins who is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''And this is one of the liabilities they can quantify. So they say to themselves, 'The lines of credit are frozen, I need money for operating expenses, so why don't I go and get some of the tax refund back early?' ''
 Through the first 10 months of this year, the city paid out $804 million in refunds to companies, many of them in the financial sector, versus an average of $246 million over the same period the previous three years. 
 The same dismal development is playing out in Albany, though the increase is less acute. New York State paid out $1 billion in corporate refunds during the first 10 months of 2008, in contrast to the $581 million it paid out during the same period in 2007.
 In all, corporate taxes make up $5.4 billion of total taxes paid to the city, or 14 percent, and $6 billion of total taxes paid to the state, or 15.6 percent.
 ''The impact will be greater here than in the rest of the nation, given the size and concentration of the financial industry in New York City and New York State,'' said Kenneth B. Bleiwas, deputy state comptroller for New York City.
 And the metropolitan area does not have a monopoly on the refund trend. Scott D. Pattison, executive director of the National Association of State Budget Officers, a professional organization, says the topic has been coming up more often in conversations with budget officials from around the country. It is something he has seen before, he said, but not on this scale.
 ''That's usually the pattern,'' Mr. Pattison said, ''especially at the beginning of really bad times.''
 Since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg unveiled the city's latest budget projections on Nov. 5, much of the attention from the City Council and advocacy groups has focused on preserving the money that the city sends out the door: tax rebate checks for property owners, financing for schools and programs for the elderly.
 But economists and city officials are deeply concerned about the money coming in. And they say that the tremendous surge in tax refunds is emblematic of the tight squeeze that the city finds itself in, both short-term and long-term.
 ''I don't remember this being a big issue before,'' said Charles M. Brecher, research director for the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed watchdog group, referring to corporate refunds. ''It seems like a sign of people being in pretty serious trouble.''
 The surge in refunds is already contributing to a new $285 million shortfall in the current year's budget, thus making it imperative, city officials say, to cut programs and raise taxes even earlier than anticipated.
 The rise in refund requests also gives the city less wiggle room to do everything that Mr. Bloomberg and the City Council agreed to in June in the city's annual budget. This helps to explain, city officials say, why the mayor has been so stubborn about delaying the $400 property tax rebate checks that homeowners have been expecting since October. The rebate program is worth $256 million.
 The requests also underscore the sobering reality that many of the city's corporations will not be paying much, if anything, in taxes for years to come. Most companies trying to absorb billions of dollars in losses this year are entitled to spread out those losses over several years, and therefore will not be liable for taxes. That translates, city officials estimate, into a loss of roughly $2 billion in tax revenue over the next few years.
 ''This will be a continuing issue -- figuring out what happens to all those losses from now-defunct or nearly defunct firms, and how those losses will work their way through the system during the course of bankruptcies and bailouts and into the tax system,'' said Donald J. Boyd, a former state budget official who is now a senior fellow at the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, part of the State University of New York system.
 Mr. Bloomberg has called the corporate refunds an ''enormous liability.'' 
 City officials say that they cannot legally disclose which companies are receiving refunds, because of state laws concerning confidentiality, privacy and competition. (The New York Times asked more than a dozen major companies that have reported fiscal difficulties this year whether they were among those requesting refunds, but the companies either did not respond or declined to comment.)
 Owen Stone, a spokesman for the city's Department of Finance, said that the requests had ''come from a wide variety of business sectors, including financial services and information services.'' A handful of companies account for a significant portion of the $804 million, however. Mr. Stone said the city had received two refund requests for more than $50 million and four between $10 million and $25 million.
 Just since September, Mr. Stone added, the city has issued 7,757 refunds to companies totaling $261 million. That represents an increase of 18 percent in the number of refunds, and 72 percent in the amount being refunded over the same period last year.
 ''This is an environment in which liquidity is a huge issue for big and small firms,'' said Marcia J. Van Wagner, a deputy in the New York City comptroller's office who specializes in budget issues. ''Everyone needs cash, and cash is king.''

HEADLINE: A Landmark Crossed the Road

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE

 BODY:
One of the few constants in Silicon Valley has been a giant billboard set on a hill beside Highway 101, near San Francisco airport. For eight years, the billboard has carried a variety of messages from Autonomy, a high-end search company that few people know. 
 On Jan. 1, Autonomy will move across the highway, from the west side to the east side, ending an era. (It won't stop advertising: the new billboard position is considered a great spot to catch the eye of taxi riders on the way to San Francisco.)
 The Autonomy billboard has been a visual cue for commuters that their congested drive to work is about to end. Other billboards have come and gone, but the Autonomy sign has remained.
 So, just about everyone in Silicon Valley should know about the company, right?
 Well, no. The slogans on the billboard haven't always been clear on what Autonomy does:
 ''Autonomy: an Intelligent World.''
 ''What software is to computers, Autonomy is to software.''
 ''Automation through understanding.''
 Where companies like Google and Yahoo perform searches for words that appear on Web pages and others help businesses dig through databases, Autonomy handles the ugly stuff that's left over. It not only searches through legal documents, videos and sounds but also tries to derive meaning from the content.
 Explaining all of that on a billboard proves pretty tough, but Autonomy has kept right on advertising anyway.
 Unlike most of the technology industry, Autonomy seems to be bucking the economic downturn. For the third quarter, net profit more than doubled, capping off a string of 35 profitable quarters. 
 Indeed, Autonomy's move across the highway can be credited to the sagging economy. The company is displacing Gap, the struggling clothing retailer.
 ''Retail has really slowed down quite a bit,'' said Nicole Eagan, Autonomy's chief marketing officer. ''That opened up a prime opportunity for us.''

HEADLINE: A Tribute to John Lennon Keeps to Its Quixotic Path

BYLINE: By NEIL GENZLINGER

 BODY:
It's a rabbit-hole kind of question born of today's surreal economy: If your annual charity fund-raiser looks as if it might actually lose money, do you stage it anyway? 
 Joe Raiola, principal organizer of an event called simply the Lennon Tribute, has the appreciation for the incongruous required to answer yes to that question: by day he's a senior editor at Mad magazine. And so he is pressing ahead with this year's event, the 28th installment of an annual show remembering John Lennon, even though what little corporate backing he had evaporated and ticket sales are as sluggish as they are for most every other kind of event in New York.
 ''Some people have suggested I cancel it,'' Mr. Raiola said. ''They just look at the numbers and say, 'My God, we're getting squeezed on both ends.' '' 
 But fund-raising wasn't the original point of this shoe-string variety show, and it's only part of the point now. ''Everything about this event is secondary to getting together to celebrate and remember John Lennon for a cause bigger than ourselves,'' Mr. Raiola said.
 And so at 7 o'clock on Sunday night at the Ailey Citigroup Theater on West 55th Street, Rosanne Cash, Cliff Eberhardt, Wendy Osserman Dance and others will serve up a bill of entertainment heavy with Lennon and Beatles songs (with Mr. Raiola doing some comedy). Whatever money the show makes will go to World Hunger Year, a nonprofit organization that seeks to battle hunger and poverty by promoting self-reliance. But if nothing else, everyone will have had a chance by the night's end to reflect on what was lost 28 Decembers ago, when Lennon was murdered outside the Dakota on West 72nd Street.
 Back in 1980 Mr. Raiola was a 25-year-old exploring experimental theater with a director named Alec Rubin and his Theater of Encounter (now called Theater Within). He was also driving a cab, which is what he was doing the night of Dec. 8.
 ''I had a very odd radio back then,'' he recalled. ''I had a radio that would pick up television stations. And I was listening to 'Monday Night Football.' '' So he, like much of the United States, had the discombobulating experience of hearing the news about Lennon from the sportscaster Howard Cosell. 
 ''I was on Queens Boulevard,'' Mr. Raiola said. ''I almost smashed into a telephone pole.''
 Though Mr. Raiola had never met Lennon, he said the loss had a personal dimension for him and others in Mr. Rubin's theater group, partly because they met just down 72nd Street from the Dakota and partly because Mr. Rubin, who was also a therapist, was interested in primal scream techniques, as was Lennon. 
 As Mr. Raiola recounts the story in ''Memories of John Lennon,'' a book of essays compiled by Yoko Ono, the next year the theater group was preparing for a reading of a play about the night Lennon died, but the playwright backed out at the last minute. Rather than cancel, the group threw together an informal evening of performances dedicated to Lennon's memory. 
 The annual tribute, sponsored by Theater Within (theatrewithin.org), has been going, and growing, ever since. Early on, with Mr. Rubin directing and Mr. Raiola producing, the lineup might have featured almost anyone, including subway performers. (''We just looked for people we liked,'' Mr. Raiola said.) But as the show moved from small black boxes to slightly larger black boxes to, now for the third year, the Ailey, it picked up better-known names.
 Some had serendipitous connections to Lennon. For instance Ben Taylor performed in 2006; his father, James, released his breakthrough album on the Beatles' Apple label. Marshall Crenshaw, who appeared last year, once played Lennon in ''Beatlemania.'' 
 Mr. Crenshaw was planning to return to the Lennon Tribute this year but was dismayed to discover he couldn't get back from a show in Alaska in time; he helped steer Mr. Raiola to Ms. Cash instead. Among Mr. Crenshaw's memories from last year's show: ''I accidentally knocked over the table that had all of Steve Forbert's harmonicas on it, meticulously placed. I still feel contrite about that.''
 Ms. Osserman has been participating for years, bringing new works choreographed to songs by or related to Lennon. (This year she is using two Yoko Ono songs.) Part of the attraction, she said, is the chance to work with a type of music she does not generally use. And if some of her dancers weren't even born when Lennon was alive, so what?
 ''It seems to me my dancers are the same as we were in the '60s,'' she said. ''They don't have any money, and they're idealistic.''
 The tribute show was just a tribute show for the first 20 years, until Mr. Raiola took it over when Mr. Rubin retired. (Mr. Rubin died in 2005.) 
 ''The first thing I did was I turned it into a charity fund-raiser,'' Mr. Raiola said, choosing charities that Lennon might have supported. It has never generated a lot of money -- the $11,000 raised in 2006 is the highest total so far -- but he said he hopes that pressing ahead in this lean year will keep the tradition alive for better times, with the 30th anniversary beckoning.
 One other thing about the tribute's evolution over the years: It has become less a cathartic mourning and more a celebration. ''This is not a morose gathering,'' Mr. Raiola said. ''This is not a funeral.''
 Mr. Eberhardt, who this year will be performing for the second time, likes that mind-set. 
 ''It's a very positive thing,'' he said, ''remembering him in a very positive light rather than tragic.'' Among the songs he plans to sing: ''You've Got to Hide Your Love Away.''
 ''The audience,'' he said, ''loves to shout the 'Hey.' ''

HEADLINE: CNN Pitches Wire Service To Compete With The A.P.

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO and RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
CNN, in the afterglow of an election season of record ratings for cable news, is elbowing in on a new line of business: catering to financially strained newspapers looking for an alternative to The Associated Press.
 For nearly a month, a trial version of CNN's wire service has been on display in some newspapers. But this week editors from about 30 papers will visit Atlanta to hear CNN's plans to broaden a service to provide coverage of big national and international events -- and maybe local ones -- on a smaller scale and at a lower cost than The A.P. 
 ''The reality is we don't have a lot of relationships with newspapers,'' said Jim Walton, president of CNN Worldwide. ''We have relationships with TV stations around the world.'' Mr. Walton said the meeting this week, which CNN has billed the ''CNN Newspaper Summit,'' is ''kind of a get-to-know-you.'' 
 With its CNN Wire, the company is going up against the largest news-gathering operation in the world in The A.P., and it must convince editors that it can offer something that is well outside its broadcast expertise -- which may not be a tough task given the dire circumstances newspapers face. In addition, a number of newspapers are unhappy with the cost of The A.P., a nonprofit corporation that is owned by the 1,400 papers that are its members. Some newspapers have even given notice that they intend to leave The A.P.
 ''I'm very interested in hearing what they have to present,'' said Benjamin J. Marrison, the editor of The Columbus Dispatch in Ohio, which is among the papers that have said they will drop The A.P. because of its cost. ''It has a lot of potential. We just need to understand it better.'' 
 ''Mainly, we're going to listen to what it is they have to offer, and what their plans are for expanding their news-gathering operation,'' Mr. Marrison added. ''They say they have more than 3,000 journalists worldwide, and that's a formidable group, and we want to see how they intend to deploy those resources, how in tune they are with the needs of newspapers and their Web sites, and what kind of cooperative they intend to build.''
 The project has several implications for the news business.
 For CNN it amounts to another expansion of its operations at a time of severe cutbacks across the media industry, especially at newspapers, which are facing the wrenching circumstances of both a faltering economy and the continuing flight of advertising dollars out of print and onto the Internet. And for The Associated Press, it represents a competitive threat, while some client newspapers already are leaving the service because of financial pressure. (CNN Wire would also compete with other services, like Bloomberg News and ThomsonReuters.)
 On Nov. 20, Tom Curley, the president and chief executive of The A.P., spoke to employees in New York City and by Webcast to groups around the world -- a recording of which was heard by The New York Times -- about the state of its business. He outlined three main challenges: the economic downturn, the financial problems of newspapers, and what he described as customers becoming competitors, specifically CNN.
 Of those three challenges, he said he was most worried about the last one.
 ''On the competitive side, CNN volunteered to be the first, but any number of people could have pulled the trigger,'' Mr. Curley told employees. ''They're coming off a very strong election cycle, they have extra money and they're going to do it because they can.''
 Mr. Walton, of CNN, says that the network already runs an internal wire service for its bureaus and CNN.com, and that taking it outside is a logical step. The breadth of the service that CNN will ultimately offer is unclear, and partly depends on the demands of newspapers. CNN Wire could offer columns written by some of its high-profile personalities, like Anderson Cooper. It also plans to offer text versions of its major investigative pieces for television.
 ''The CNN system is set up so we use content across all our networks and platforms,'' Mr. Walton said. ''It's not unusual for Anderson Cooper to appear online or on CNN International.''
 And local coverage could be in the offing. In August, CNN said it was dispatching journalists to 10 cities in the United States, but in a bare-bones fashion: the correspondents will be laptop- and camera-toting one-person bands, rather than workers in expensive bureaus.
 ''This is obviously a national wire service,'' said Susan Goldberg, the editor of The Plain Dealer in Cleveland, which has already published some stories from CNN's wire service. ''They're not opening up shop here in Ohio necessarily. We would like to see them put out accurate, informative, entertaining news and information. We would also love to see them produce content that works really well on the Web. Shorter stories, because all of us are dealing with shrinking space in our print edition.'' (An editor from The Plain Dealer will attend the CNN meetings.)
 A number of newspaper editors say the component of A.P. service that would be hardest to replace is still photography. CNN said it did not plan to offer photography but would offer streaming Web video for newspapers' sites.
 Mr. Walton declined to say how many journalists CNN was looking to hire, but job ads have been appearing online. One recent posting sought journalists to staff bureaus in Atlanta, Washington and Los Angeles. 
 The help-wanted ad described the service like this: ''The CNN Wire is on CNN's editorial front line, editing and vetting the work of correspondents and producers worldwide and doing original reporting for use across CNN's networks and Web pages.''
 In an interview, Mr. Curley of The A.P. said that given the state of the news industry, ''we should rejoice that someone has millions of dollars to spend on breaking news.''
 ''Breaking news is very, very expensive and if they have the resources to spend on it, we welcome them to the game,'' he added.
 But in his conference with employees, Mr. Curley suggested that the CNN wire service needed major improvement before it could play at The A.P.'s level.
 ''You really don't want to put quotes up there that could end up on locker room walls,'' Mr. Curley said, before doing just that.
 ''The current CNN wire, if you look at it truly is still, and remarkably, abysmally written,'' he said. ''However, they're interviewing A.P. people, we know, and that can be transformed. And if you have enough money and you have enough ego and enough desire, you can fix that in a hurry.''
 Last year CNN said it was dropping Reuters' wire service. The move saved the network more than $3 million annually, but it was not a cost-cutting decision, executives said. Instead, it was part of CNN's strategy of relying less on outside media outlets for news coverage. In that vein, CNN plans to drop The A.P. for CNN.com in January. (CNN the television network will continue to use The A.P.)
 ''Look at the history of CNN,'' Mr. Walton said. ''We launched as one network in 1980. Today CNN is more than just one network. We have a huge radio business. A huge online business. We're about content.''
 ''We want to own more of our own content and reporting. We felt we had to look at our business as more than television,'' he added.
 The Associated Press is more than 150 years old and is the world's largest news-gathering operation, with more than 3,000 journalists in over 100 countries. 
 ''I think the crucial question is whether CNN is going to try to really go head-to-head with The A.P., or offer something that's a lot more selective,'' said Jack Driscoll, the former editor of The Boston Globe and editor in residence at the M.I.T. Media Laboratory. ''Newspapers are hurting so much that they could be willing to get less for less.''
 In that case, Mr. Driscoll said, there is probably room for a new competitor.
 ''But if CNN is going to try to do something close to the range and quality of The Associated Press, that's awfully hard to do, and it's a huge financial undertaking.''
 Some newspapers that have long relied on The A.P. have said they would drop the service because of its cost, which varies -- The Columbus Dispatch, for example, paid more than $800,000 a year. Others, including The Star Tribune of Minneapolis and the Tribune Company, one of the largest newspaper chains, have also given notice that they plan to drop out of the service. The A.P., in response, announced in October that it would reduce prices, which will result in a cumulative savings of $30 million annually for its member newspapers.
 This stands in contrast to the current financial fortunes of CNN. 
 In October, CNN said it was hiring nearly 30 people to staff a news hub in Abu Dhabi, and has made other international expansion moves. And Mr. Walton said the network was on track for its fifth consecutive year of double-digit profit growth, a first for CNN.
 ''One of the good things is that when you are profitable, you can reinvest,'' Mr. Walton said.

HEADLINE: The Horror in Mumbai

 BODY:
We share the horror, the pain and the disbelief that Indians are feeling as they absorb the appalling details of the terrorist attacks in Mumbai that left nearly 200 dead. We also recognize and understand the questions Indians are asking themselves, and the anger they are feeling, about what some are calling their own 9/11.
 How can their government have ignored the warning signs? A 2007 report to Parliament warned that the country's shores were poorly protected -- and some or all of the attackers arrived by boat. Why weren't the police and the army better prepared to respond? Sharpshooters outside the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower Hotel did not have telescopic sights, so they could not get off a shot for fear of killing hostages rather than the terrorists. 
 Most of all, who is to blame and who should pay the price for such cruelty? 
 Deccan Mujahedeen, the group that claimed responsibility -- the term itself is so chillingly flawed -- is unknown. But Indian and American intelligence officials saw signs pointing to Lashkar-e-Taiba, an Islamist group from the disputed region of Kashmir that is increasingly collaborating with the Taliban and Al Qaeda. What makes that especially frightening is that the group received training and support from Pakistan's intelligence services, before it was officially banned in 2002. 
 We fear that whoever was behind it, the carnage will unleash dangerous new furies between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan. And we fear it will divert even more of Pakistan's attention and troops away from fighting extremists on its western border with Afghanistan. 
 India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has so far shown extraordinary forbearance. But there are already strong calls for him to retaliate -- with or without proof of who was behind the attack. We urge him to carefully consider the consequences.
 India's leaders must be very careful not to ignite a religious war inside their own borders. Any military confrontation with Pakistan would be hugely costly in human life. And even the threat of war would be hugely damaging to India's extraordinary economic progress. 
 The Bush administration must use all of its influence to ensure that India's leaders recognize these dangers. And it must assure the Indians that it will bring all of the pressure it can on Pakistan to cooperate fully with the investigation -- no matter where it leads. 
 We were heartened when Pakistan's civilian government immediately agreed to send the new chief of the country's powerful intelligence agency, the ISI, to India. We hoped that meant the government was confident that the ISI played no role in the attack. Or that it was finally prepared to purge its ranks of all those who have aided and abetted extremists. 
 Unfortunately, the offer was quickly withdrawn after the Pakistani Army and opposition parties objected. The government then announced that a lower-level intelligence official would go at some point. By Saturday, Pakistani officials were blustering as if they were the victims. Despite all of the recent horrors Pakistan has suffered, its military and intelligence services still do not understand that the terrorists pose a mortal threat to their own country. 
 In coming days India will have to look inward to see where and how its government failed to protect its citizens. The United States is still learning the lessons of its own failures before 9/11, but it can help in the process. 
 Washington's most important role will be to urge the Indians and Pakistanis to step back from the brink. The next administration will then have to move quickly to encourage serious negotiations over the future of Kashmir and genuine cooperation to defeat extremists.

HEADLINE: For Giants, Burress Is Now Just a Safety Hazard

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Landover, Md. 

 BODY:
 Time to say goodbye. The Giants players may say, and quite obviously they mean it, that their main concern is the health of their teammate Plaxico Burress. 
 That is how a mature and successful football team expresses itself after yet another compelling victory on the road, the way the Giants did after humbling Washington on Sunday, 23-7. 
 The Giants are good enough that they can afford to be magnanimous about the knucklehead who shot himself in the thigh in a nightclub Friday night. The typical football groupthink is concern for his welfare. But that is not enough. 
 The suggestion that the Giants dismiss Burress does not come from latent rooting interest in the Giants but rather from concern about firepower in the hands or pockets of celebrities who often have dozens or hundreds of strangers milling around them. Burress can outleap safeties on the field but apparently cannot manage the safety on his weapon.
 ''I do know that a lot of N.F.L. players do carry guns,'' said John Mara, the president and co-owner of the Giants. Mara added, ''It's not something that we're particularly pleased about, but that is the choice that they make.'' 
 Given the investment in personnel and product, Mara is quite right not to be pleased. Next time, Burress could take down one of his teammates, just dressing for a game, or even a practice, if he were feeling really diligent that week. He is that dangerous. Great hands on the football field, but not very good decisions on a Friday night when he goes out to dance the gavotte in a Manhattan nightclub. 
 So the Giants should cut him loose. It sounds coldblooded, but they should, even as he apparently prepares to turn himself in to authorities on Monday. Is that what the Giants really want hanging over them when his hamstring and his gunshot wound are healed and he is pronounced fit to practice? N.F.L. contracts almost always favor the club. Flub a field goal, get burned for a touchdown, miss a block, blow curfew? See ya. 
 Burress was always a loose cannon. Now he is a loose pistol. The pity would be if the Giants continued to depend on him. Before a tougher game, against a better team than Washington, Burress just may take another walkabout, and the air could go out of the team.
 Right now, the Giants can deal from strength while they have an 11-1 record for the first time in the history of the franchise and while they challenge one another to repeat as champions, like the 1991-92 Chicago Bulls did. It's a reasonable dare, even in a league built on parity. 
 Actually, Burress has already endangered one of his teammates, with a stray bullet whizzing around some nightclub. Next time, it could be the clubhouse or a team bus or even the team plane. By packing what was almost surely an illegal weapon for a night on the town, Burress put his teammate, Antonio Pierce, in his circle of immaturity and disdain for the law.
 If preliminary reports are true, Pierce did not conduct himself as a solid citizen when he tried to hide his teammate's weapon somewhere in New Jersey. Those other Jersey boys, the Sopranos, always knew where to dispose of the weapon -- and the body, for that matter. 
 But that was a television show. This was real life, and when the shot rang out and the blood started dripping in Manhattan, it appeared that Pierce carried the weapon across state lines, the way Tony and Christopher and Paulie Walnuts would have done. Not exactly what the Giants, the N.F.L. and the various legal authorities in two states would prefer.
 Pierce played his usual linebacker game of enlightened menace on Sunday afternoon and then appeared in the interview room, a glimmer of a diamond on his left ear, an intelligent blend of sneer and smile on his face. He reassured reporters that he was ''fine,'' apparently in the legal sense, and would not otherwise discuss the events of Friday night, as they shall hereafter be called. His main point was that Giants stick together, e pluribus unum, semper fidelis and all that. Which does not mean he may not need a lawyer.
 The Giants need do nothing about Pierce for the moment but ride his skill and leadership toward another round of playoffs, and let the legalities work themselves out. But surely in the fine print of any N.F.L. contract is some personal-conduct clause that would enable the Giants to jettison Burress, with pay, without pay, whatever. 
 He will not go unemployed for long. Besides, wouldn't Plaxico Burress look good sitting on the Knicks' bench? The Knicks' front office has blundered into a seven-man team, and sometimes suits up an eighth player, the noted malcontent Stephon Marbury, just to satisfy the league minimum. 
 Burress, at 6 feet 5 inches, is three inches taller than Marbury. The way he outreaches defensive backs, when he feels like performing, surely approximates N.B.A. level. Marbury, the Giants do not need. 
 They are Super Bowl champions and they are 11-1 and they do not need this kind of trouble.

HEADLINE: A New Era Of Debtor Nations

BYLINE: By RICHARD BEALES and CHRISTOPHER HUGHES

 BODY:
A new era of government borrowing is beginning globally.
The United States and Europe will issue record levels of i.o.u.'s as governments finance deficits and rescues. That's problematic for public finance managers. It also raises challenges for others, including investors and nongovernmental borrowers.
The United States already borrows plenty, but the debt load is growing. Some estimates of new government borrowing top $2 trillion for the current fiscal year. 
Public finance officials will have to lean toward issuing more longer-term debt to defer and spread out repayments. The 30-year ''long bond'' is one candidate, but in November the Treasury also reintroduced auctions for three-year notes, potentially reducing somewhat the government's reliance on debt that has to be repaid within weeks or months.
For now, the task is made easier by low borrowing costs. Demand for safe investments like the three-month Treasury bill is so strong that investors are willing to own them even though they receive almost no interest. Ten- and 30-year bonds are yielding roughly 3 percent and 3.5 percent, respectively -- historically low rates.
This won't, however, last forever. The impending flood of government debt for sale could turn off some buyers.
And when investors get over their fear and feel greedy again, demand for government debt could drop off sharply, sending prices down and interest rates up. That's a planning quandary for investors and those in government finance.
There's also the danger of crowding out the private sector. With investment dollars scarce, debate is already raging about the relative desirability of Treasury-issued debt, debt and related obligations of the government-controlled companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and government-guaranteed debt issued by banks.
Ordinary corporate borrowers, even those with strong credit, may have trouble obtaining loans to finance inventories, payrolls and investment, among other things. That situation should ease once investors are willing to take risks again, but heavy issuance of government debt could delay that turning point and continue excluding private borrowers.
Governments certainly have little choice but to take on debt to keep the financial system moving. But the resulting glut of public sector debt could change the financial game.
Taxpayers at the Gate
In October, the British government suggested it would be as single-minded as Henry R. Kravis in seeking a decent financial return from the tens of billions of pounds it had committed to invest in domestic banks -- now including $:15 billion ($23 billion) for a 58 percent stake in the Royal Bank of Scotland.
But a government is not the same as a buyout baron like Mr. Kravis. It represents taxpayers, whose commercial interest is not limited to share prices and returns on equity.
The government should worry about getting value for money, and its main portfolio is the $:1.4 trillion economy. That is in bad shape, and could get worse if banks cut back too far on lending. Revival depends on restoring a suitable level of credit availability.
That may mean banks would have to take on risky business and adopt a lenient approach to struggling borrowers. To the extent that conflicts with the ''wholly commercial'' approach the government promised in October, it is clear which view should prevail.
Few taxpayers would cheer if the government reported a $:5 billion profit two years from now from the sale of a shrunken, restructured and financially strong R.B.S. -- if that strength came at the expense of a wrecked economy. But it is also possible to reconcile the conflict.
The banks' fortunes depend on the health of the broader economy in the medium to long term. So taking the long view, it is possible to square the commercial management of R.B.S. and other lenders with short-term strategies intended to help the British economy.
For now, though, R.B.S.'s share price says it all. It closed at 55.3 pence on Friday, against the government's subscription price of 65.5 pence. For the time being, the institution is worth more to British taxpayers than to its other shareholders.

HEADLINE: Deficits And The Future

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Right now there's intense debate about how aggressive the United States government should be in its attempts to turn the economy around. Many economists, myself included, are calling for a very large fiscal expansion to keep the economy from going into free fall. Others, however, worry about the burden that large budget deficits will place on future generations.
 But the deficit worriers have it all wrong. Under current conditions, there's no trade-off between what's good in the short run and what's good for the long run; strong fiscal expansion would actually enhance the economy's long-run prospects. 
 The claim that budget deficits make the economy poorer in the long run is based on the belief that government borrowing ''crowds out'' private investment -- that the government, by issuing lots of debt, drives up interest rates, which makes businesses unwilling to spend on new plant and equipment, and that this in turn reduces the economy's long-run rate of growth. Under normal circumstances there's a lot to this argument.
 But circumstances right now are anything but normal. Consider what would happen next year if the Obama administration gave in to the deficit hawks and scaled back its fiscal plans.
 Would this lead to lower interest rates? It certainly wouldn't lead to a reduction in short-term interest rates, which are more or less controlled by the Federal Reserve. The Fed is already keeping those rates as low as it can -- virtually at zero -- and won't change that policy unless it sees signs that the economy is threatening to overheat. And that doesn't seem like a realistic prospect any time soon.
 What about longer-term rates? These rates, which are already at a half-century low, mainly reflect expected future short-term rates. Fiscal austerity could push them even lower -- but only by creating expectations that the economy would remain deeply depressed for a long time, which would reduce, not increase, private investment.
 The idea that tight fiscal policy when the economy is depressed actually reduces private investment isn't just a hypothetical argument: it's exactly what happened in two important episodes in history.
 The first took place in 1937, when Franklin Roosevelt mistakenly heeded the advice of his own era's deficit worriers. He sharply reduced government spending, among other things cutting the Works Progress Administration in half, and also raised taxes. The result was a severe recession, and a steep fall in private investment. 
 The second episode took place 60 years later, in Japan. In 1996-97 the Japanese government tried to balance its budget, cutting spending and raising taxes. And again the recession that followed led to a steep fall in private investment.
 Just to be clear, I'm not arguing that trying to reduce the budget deficit is always bad for private investment. You can make a reasonable case that Bill Clinton's fiscal restraint in the 1990s helped fuel the great U.S. investment boom of that decade, which in turn helped cause a resurgence in productivity growth.
 What made fiscal austerity such a bad idea both in Roosevelt's America and in 1990s Japan were special circumstances: in both cases the government pulled back in the face of a liquidity trap, a situation in which the monetary authority had cut interest rates as far as it could, yet the economy was still operating far below capacity.
 And we're in the same kind of trap today -- which is why deficit worries are misplaced. 
 One more thing: Fiscal expansion will be even better for America's future if a large part of the expansion takes the form of public investment -- of building roads, repairing bridges and developing new technologies, all of which make the nation richer in the long run.
 Should the government have a permanent policy of running large budget deficits? Of course not. Although public debt isn't as bad a thing as many people believe -- it's basically money we owe to ourselves -- in the long run the government, like private individuals, has to match its spending to its income.
 But right now we have a fundamental shortfall in private spending: consumers are rediscovering the virtues of saving at the same moment that businesses, burned by past excesses and hamstrung by the troubles of the financial system, are cutting back on investment. That gap will eventually close, but until it does, government spending must take up the slack. Otherwise, private investment, and the economy as a whole, will plunge even more.
 The bottom line, then, is that people who think that fiscal expansion today is bad for future generations have got it exactly wrong. The best course of action, both for today's workers and for their children, is to do whatever it takes to get this economy on the road to recovery.

HEADLINE: Crumbling South Bronx As a Muse

BYLINE: By RANDY KENNEDY

 BODY:
When Ray Mortenson first started taking his cameras through the most wasted of the wastelands that made up parts of the South Bronx in the early 1980s, he devised a helpful subway mantra: Take the 5, stay alive. Take the 4, dead for sure.
 This was only because the No. 5 line led through a handful of neighborhoods -- East Tremont, Mott Haven, Morrisania -- that had been so gutted and burned out during the 1970s that whole blocks were almost completely abandoned, meaning fewer chances of stumbling into a mugger or drug deal. 
 As a sculptor and photographer, Mr. Mortenson began making these Bronx trips because he was interested in the purely physical and visual characteristics of a once dense, elegant urban landscape that had come to look like excavated Pompeii or Dresden after the firebombs. Not that he would have ever wanted part of his city to endure the kind of devastation it did, but once the South Bronx reached that state he approached it aesthetically, as a ''hard-art project.''
 ''I like being here,'' he wrote. ''I like the way it looks.''
 Mr. Mortenson's rarely exhibited black-and-white photographs, made between 1982 and 1984, are such powerful artifacts of their era that they have always struggled against being pulled into the documentary realm. And now, in a show of the pictures at the Museum of the City of New York called ''Broken Glass'' -- the title is a line borrowed from the lyrics of the Grandmaster Flash classic ''The Message'' -- the pictures have the added resonance of appearing as the nation confronts its most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression, making them feel like a kind of augury.
 ''You hear about this happening now in suburban places hit by foreclosures -- empty houses, windows going broken, swimming pools filling up with trash,'' Mr. Mortenson said in a recent interview at the museum.
 When he began taking the pictures, he was working as an electrician and engaged by the ideas of artists like Robert Smithson and Gordon Matta-Clark, whose explorations of urban decay and entropy had made America's crumbling infrastructure into a new canvas for art. 
 In the late 1960s Smithson photographed the industrial ruins around his birthplace, Passaic, N.J., christening them as monuments. In the early 1970s Matta-Clark staged illegal ''interventions'' in some of the same Bronx neighborhoods that Mr. Mortenson was to visit, slicing whole sculpturelike sections from the floors and walls of abandoned tenements.
 Mr. Mortenson's first photographic explorations of this sort took him to the Meadowlands in New Jersey, where nature and industrial decay met in epic combat. Toward the end of the years he spent exploring the swamps he began taking the elevated subway lines through the Bronx and looking out at the rubble that many neighborhoods had been reduced to. As a child growing up in Delaware, he loved spending time alone walking through forests and fields, and he said he thought of the Meadowlands and then the Bronx in the same way.
 ''I could spend hours walking around some blocks without seeing anyone,'' he said. He would wander around Charlotte Street, one of the South Bronx's bleakest, which President Jimmy Carter had made infamous in a 1977 visit. (It is now in a suburblike neighborhood of neat single-family homes built not many years after Mr. Mortenson's photographs were taken.) 
 He would walk through dozens of buildings that seemed to have been abandoned overnight, with coats still hanging on closet doors and furniture still in the living rooms. But the elements had begun to creep in through the broken windows, peeling the paint and causing ceiling plaster to rain down on the floors.
 Mr. Mortenson, now 64, began shooting inconspicuously, wearing a beaten-up Army jacket, with a rolled-up New York Post under his arm and a 35-millimeter camera in his pocket. But as he began to learn the neighborhoods, spending sometimes 12 hours a day there during long summer days, he started to lug around a big, boxy view camera. He would set it up on the streets or inside abandoned apartments on a tripod to make exposures sometimes lasting as long as 10 minutes.
 ''I'd set up the shot and open the lens and then just walk around the building, exploring, until it was done,'' he said.
 Occasionally he ran into other human beings. Once he was surrounded by drug dealers, who demanded his film, and in the darkness of some buildings he would almost stumble over scavengers ripping out copper wiring and pipes. ''You really had a heart attack when that happened,'' he said, ''and I'm sure those guys were having a heart attack too.''
 In contrast to the work of photographers who have concentrated on urban decay from a more sociological perspective, like Camilo Jose Vergara, or even from an activist standpoint, like Mel Rosenthal, who was shooting the South Bronx at the same time, Mr. Mortenson's pictures are devoid of people or even cars. Other than notations of the day they were shot, there is no information accompanying them. ''I wasn't carrying a notebook or even a map,'' he said. ''I was just going where my eye took me.''
 Sean Corcoran, the curator of prints and photographs at the Museum of the City of New York, said he was drawn to the images in part because of the tension in them between art and history. ''The act of framing and capturing an image from the world is inherently transformative,'' he wrote in the catalog for the show, which runs through March 8. ''Yet the pictures also provide an important record of a moment in time.'' 
 Mr. Corcoran writes that they insistently ask the question: ''How could things get to this point? What political, economic and cultural shifts could lead to such a collapse?''
 Mr. Mortenson said he had not returned to those blocks since he stopped taking photographs in the Bronx in 1984. ''I'm ambivalent about it,'' he said. ''There was something about being there alone, about that time, that I guess I want to keep.''
 ''It was kind of like being in a horror movie,'' he added. ''But that was all part of it.''

HEADLINE: Security Issues Shut Down Downtown Copter Shuttle

BYLINE: By PATRICK MCGEEHAN

 BODY:
U.S. Helicopter, the only company shuttling travelers from heliports in Manhattan to local airports, was already in dire financial straits, but a decision by city officials has left the air-shuttle operator unable to fly to or from its base of operations near Wall Street.
 The problem involves FirstFlight, a small aviation company that city officials selected to manage the Downtown Manhattan Heliport. That company, which had no experience operating an urban heliport or airport, took over operations at the downtown heliport on Nov. 1. But it still has not obtained the federal Transportation Security Administration's approval of its plan for maintaining security there. 
 Without an approved security plan, FirstFlight cannot serve U.S. Helicopter's passengers, who had been clearing security at the heliport and bypassing the screening lines at Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International airports. U.S. Helicopter has been telling passengers that the disruption was only temporary, but it has stretched into its fourth week and may last a few more, according to Lara Uselding, a spokeswoman for the security administration.
 The absence of a security plan has left the security administration's crew at the heliport with no luggage or passengers to screen. The federal agency assigned a screening team to the heliport before U.S. Helicopter began operating there in early 2006, just as the agency reduced staffing at the region's three major airports. 
 (On Wednesday, the screeners were temporarily reassigned to La Guardia Airport to help handle the holiday rush, Ms. Uselding said.)
 That setup allowed U.S. Helicopter's customers, who paid as much as $159 for an eight-minute ride, to clear security in Manhattan and fly directly to secure areas of the airports. 
 Until Nov. 1, the company was running flights from two heliports -- one near Wall Street and another at the east end of 34th Street -- to Kennedy and Newark. For the past few weeks, travelers who live or work in Lower Manhattan have had to travel more than three miles uptown to the East 34th Street Heliport to board a U.S. Helicopter flight. 
 U.S. Helicopter had ambitious plans to expand the service to La Guardia and a third heliport on the West Side of Manhattan, then to other cities, including Chicago and Los Angeles. But demand for the service has been weak, and the company has had trouble financing its growth.
 As its losses have piled up, the company has been borrowing to stay in business at interest rates as high as 15 percent, according to its filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Earlier this year, the company's auditors expressed doubt about its ability to continue operating.
 It was unclear how much U.S. Helicopter had suffered from being barred from using its downtown heliport or how long the company could survive without it. Donal McSullivan, the company's chief marketing officer, did not respond to messages left on his cellphone and at the company's offices. 
 U.S. Helicopter's troubles were compounded when the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey stopped managing the downtown heliport on Oct. 31. City officials had expected FirstFlight, which won the contract to operate the heliport over several other bidders, to take over without disruption, said David Lombino, a spokesman for the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which oversaw the bidding. 
 But the company did not draw up a security plan of its own and seek the Transportation Security Administration's approval until the Port Authority's managers were leaving the heliport and taking their security plan with them, aviation officials said. 
 Paul Dudley, owner of Linden Airport Management Corporation in New Jersey, an unsuccessful bidder, sued the Economic Development Corporation in state and federal courts and appealed to city officials, arguing, among other things, that FirstFlight was unqualified to operate the heliport. The failure to obtain the required federal approval was proof that he was right, Mr. Dudley said in an interview.
 ''The city should have canceled them immediately because they failed to meet a principal and fundamental requirement of the contract,'' Mr. Dudley said.
 Ronald J. Ricciardi, vice chairman of FirstFlight, did not respond to a request for comment.
 ''Any new entity that would be a new operator would hopefully understand the importance of security in the New York City area and should expect to comply with Congressional mandates for upholding the highest levels of security,'' Ms. Uselding said. 
 She added that the security administration was working with FirstFlight officials and hoped to have an acceptable security plan drawn up ''in the coming weeks.''
 In the meantime, the downtown heliport has remained open for the sightseeing and charter flights by other companies that account for most of the traffic there, Mr. Lombino said. ''The transition to FirstFlight has been otherwise seamless, and the heliport has been operating in a safe and efficient manner.''

HEADLINE: Makers Hope Touch Screens Will Help Cellphone Sales

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM and MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
This holiday, cellphone makers and carriers are pushing some shiny new toys: phones with touch-sensitive screens like the one on the AppleiPhone.
The companies are hoping to duplicate the blockbuster success of the iPhone with models that, in their glassy minimalism, end up looking a lot like it. These include the G1, powered by Google's Android software; the Instinct from Samsung; the LG Dare; and, most recently, Research in Motion's much-anticipated BlackBerry Storm.
But with consumers keeping a close watch on their bank balances, analysts and industry experts say most touch-screen phones will have trouble getting onto the list of this season's must-have gadgets.
The surge of touch screens has its roots in the introduction of the iPhone on AT&T's network in June 2007, which left rival carriers scrambling for comparable offerings. 
''What you're seeing right now is the first wave of competitors spurred by the media juggernaut for the iPhone,'' said Ed Snyder, a telecommunications industry analyst with Charter Equity Research. Mr. Snyder said that when the iPhone hype hit, ''no credible cellphone executive could not get a touch-screen phone started.''
Since its introduction, the iPhone, which is available only through AT&T in the United States, has helped AT&T steal customers from other carriers. Wireless service operators are now concentrating on retaining current subscribers as much as they are trying to reel in new ones, said Charles Golvin, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. Part of that strategy, Mr. Golvin said, is offering perks like exclusive ''presales'' of hot new models to subscribers.
Phone shoppers say carriers and contracts have a big influence on their decisions about phones. ''I'm pretty sure my next phone will be a touch screen,'' said Vernon McIntosh, 40, a personal trainer from New York who is an AT&T customer.
Mr. McIntosh was in a Verizon store last week and said he was choosing between an iPhone and the BlackBerry Storm. ''But I'm not eligible for an upgrade at AT&T,'' he said. ''It might be cheaper to switch contracts.''
To help drum up excitement for the release of the Storm, Verizon Wireless rolled out a teaser campaign in early October that zeroed in on the phone's distinctive feature: a palpable clicking sensation when the screen is pressed.
The Storm, which costs $200 after rebate with a new two-year contract, also has built-in appeal for the existing base of BlackBerry fanatics, and it appears to be a hit. When the Storm went on sale Nov. 21, people lined up outside Verizon stores to get their hands on it, and many stores quickly sold out.
An employee at a Verizon Wireless store in Midtown Manhattan said Friday that none of the company's stores in Manhattan had the Storm in stock, but that people were still streaming in to place orders. The earliest those customers can expect their phones to ship is Dec. 15, the employee said.
Nancy Stark, a spokeswoman for Verizon, said she could not provide figures on sales or inventory for the Storm, although she did say it had been the company's ''fastest-selling phone to date.'' Verizon's next touch-screen models are the $350 HTC Touch Pro, available now, and the $249 Samsung Omnia, which is for sale online and will be in stores next week.
Touch-screen phones do have their critics. Mr. Snyder says the bigger screens are a drain on battery life, and the phones require users to look at the screen instead of getting to know the phone's buttons by feel.
''You're getting all these extras so you can look at the phone and stand still, when you bought the phone so you could move,'' he said. ''Only a niche of users are going to be willing to spend money to have the extra capability.''
''The hype surrounding the touch-screen technology far exceeds its impact,'' Mr. Snyder said.
Dave Perry, a business developer who was shopping in a Verizon store in Manhattan last week, said he liked the user-friendliness and big screens of touch-screen phones. ''But there are drawbacks: the accuracy of typing and reliability of the screen,'' he said.
''I don't necessarily think the technology is where it needs to be,'' Mr. Perry said, adding that the occasional problems and slow responses from the devices were ''not something I'm willing to wait for.''
Touch-screen phones remain a fraction of the overall mobile phone market, but sales have been soaring. In the 12 months through September, sales of the phones in North America grew 130 percent, in contrast to 4 percent growth in the overall phone market, according to comScore M:Metrics, a market research firm.
As of September, M:Metrics data shows, more than 2.6 million people in North America had some model of the iPhone. The second-most-popular touch-screen model was the LG Voyager, which was available through Verizon Wireless and had 851,000 users.
Mr. Golvin said it was unlikely that touch-screen phones would take over the industry.
''There's no question that it's a very fast-growing segment of the market,'' Mr. Golvin said. ''It's become one of the form factors that some consumers want.''
But Mr. Golvin said there had been similar frenzies for flip phones and candy-bar-style phones when they were introduced. ''And yet today, there are still plenty of people who prefer a flip phone.''
Touch-screen technology first appeared in devices like the Treo that were aimed at professional users, and the screens were best activated with thin plastic styluses. Since the advent of the iPhone, more touch screens are activated with the fingers, and the phones themselves are aimed at mainstream users.
The phones also tend to cost several hundred dollars, which could hurt sales in an economic downturn. For its part, Sprint is fighting the barrage of high-end phones from its competitors with a new marketing campaign that emphasizes the money-saving value of its phones and plans.
Ev Gonzalez, director of device marketing for Verizon Wireless, said the company recognized that touch-screen technology was not for everyone. In fact, he said, touch screens are likely to show up on a limited number of the company's devices.
''There are consumers who are looking for straight phone services,'' Mr. Gonzalez said. ''Where the touch screen is not needed, we won't provide it.''

HEADLINE: Turning Around the Idea of Student Loans

BYLINE: By STEVE FRIESS

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- Over sandwiches and pizza, a group of high school students here debated the pros and cons of combating poverty in five desperate nations. They scrolled through Web sites, analyzed statistics and considered how much they knew about the economy, language and culture of each country.
This was no mere academic exercise. The students, at the Meadows School, have real decisions to make and, they hope, real people to rescue. By the time they scattered after their lunch period, the group had deferred until next month the decision on where to spend the $25,000 they had raised, but seemed to be leaning toward Peru.
That may seem like a lot of money for a student group, but it was the entry fee for the school to become investors in Pro Mujer, a nonprofit lending institution based in New York that issues small loans to poor women in foreign countries to use for buying tools to start or expand small businesses. 
In raising the money and investing it with Pro Mujer, the Meadows School is by all accounts one of the first high schools to operate a microbank. ''In all the contacts I have had, I've never seen a school do this in that particular way, so it's definitely something extraordinary,'' said Brad Hales, assistant director of the Economic Self-Reliance Center at Brigham Young University, widely seen as the academic backbone of the microfinance movement. ''At most schools, a club may start and raise a couple of hundred of dollars and the larger microbanks will take their money as a donation, but it's not enough money to have much say.''
The founder of the Meadows Microcredit Action Group, Justin Blau, 17, and its faculty adviser, Kirk Knutsen, have bigger plans for their endeavor.
Pro Mujer will mete out the $25,000 to recipients in the country the students select and return to the school both regular status reports as well as a modest amount of earned interest. The group plans to use that interest and other money raised locally to invest in smaller, more specific projects through Kiva, another microfinance lender, with no minimum entry requirement.
''We wanted to have a much larger impact and establish ourselves as the first high school microbank so we could make sure that it continues in an ongoing basis and so we could encourage other schools to do it,'' said Justin, a senior who recently worked as a Congressional page for Representative Shelley Berkley, Democrat of Nevada. ''This is a five-year loan, and that helps ensure a certain amount of longevity for this project.''
Justin said he first became interested in poverty issues while researching a debate team speech on problems in sub-Saharan Africa. His debate teacher, Mr. Knutsen, had recently become intrigued by what he had read on microfinance and its chief theorist, Muhammad Yunus, the Bangladeshi economist who received the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize for promulgating the view that such lending creates work and income.
At Pro Mujer, for instance, the average loan is about $220 and buys things like sewing machines or milk cows, which recipients then use to produce and sell goods and commodities.
After Justin and Mr. Knutsen began the club a year ago, more than 50 of the 250 students at the $20,000-a-year private school in the upscale northwest region of Las Vegas joined.
By spring, students had begun weekly sandwich sales during lunch, netting a monthly profit of about $800. Justin's father and uncle each gave $5,000, as did Mr. Knutsen; other parents contributed lesser sums. Ms. Berkley kicked in $250 after Justin talked up the concept of microfinance while working for her over the summer.
''It is lofty, but it's also very practical because it works,'' Ms. Berkley said. ''But what I was particularly pleased about was here we had a young man from Las Vegas who had taken the initiative to learn about a program and implement it and get all the kids involved.''
In one case, two ninth-grade girls raised $750 in part by operating a lemonade stand in a neighborhood where customers pulled up in BMWs and Mercedeses.
''We figured we'd make $60, maybe,'' said one of the girls, Sarah Aziz, recalling the triple-digit heat of the Saturday in September when she was also fasting for Ramadan. ''It was incredible how many people stopped and wanted to help.'' Sarah's father, Gamal Aziz, is the president of MGM Grand HotelShelley Berkley>Meadows, founded and operated by Carolyn Goodman, the wife of the Las Vegas mayor, Oscar Goodman, occupies a lush 40-acre campus dotted by markers touting the sponsorships of buildings, benches, trees, even trash receptacles in honor of the scions of the city's business and political leaders.
The project surprised Pro Mujer's founder, Lynn Patterson, who said her agency had never been approached by a high school before. While Mr. Knutsen and Justin say they hope to negotiate with Pro Mujer for a more detailed accounting of specific people who receive their money, Ms. Patterson said that may not be realistic given that the organization has more than $50 million in loans distributed to 215,000 borrowers at any given time.
She is, however, open to considering new ways to work with students. Those at Meadows, for instance, seemed to be leaning toward directing their money to Peruvian women in part because Peru would be closer and less expensive for them to visit than another contender, Argentina.
''We really haven't thought a lot about this, but I like the idea about kids learning about poverty and the world and what works and being part of the solution,'' Ms. Patterson said. ''If it doesn't happen early, it may not happen. It's a great idea.''
The students have become microfinance evangelists who say they often find themselves defending it to skeptical donors.
''Adults I talk to say, 'I don't believe in that stuff; you should be helping people right here in America,' '' said a junior, Ashley Lovell, 16, who is in line to run the group after Justin graduates. ''Of course that's very important, but I believe America has the ability to help itself. In the countries we're looking at, the government can't help the people. There's no public funding. They rely entirely on charitable gifts to survive.''
Postscript: December 5, 2008, Friday
An article on Monday about high school students involved in microbanking reported that the Meadows School in Las Vegas was thought to be the first high school to operate a microbank. After the article was published, a reader alerted The Times that at least one other school operated one earlier. Bellevue High School in Bellevue, Wash., raised $125,000 last year for microloans for the Dominican Republic.

HEADLINE: OPEC Ends Its Meeting With No Plan To Lift Prices

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: CAIRO 

 BODY:
Over the summer, the OPEC cartel could not prevent oil prices from surging to record levels even as its members pumped as much oil as possible. Now, oil producers seem equally unable to stop prices from collapsing as economies around the world slow rapidly.
 Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries left Cairo this weekend without an agreement to reduce production and push prices higher. The informal meeting here served only to expose the frayed message from the group, which accounts for 40 percent of the world's oil exports. 
 The meeting did little to offer the oil markets some direction. So the uncertainty remains: Have producers managed to draw a line in the sand, or will oil prices keep falling?
 After topping $145 a barrel in July, prices have slipped more than $90 because of slower global growth. Prices could keep falling next year, analysts say, with some predicting new lows of around $30 a barrel. 
 On Friday, oil futures in New York settled at $54.43 a barrel, after dropping below $50 the previous week, their lowest in more than three years. The cartel said Saturday that it would consider reducing production when it met next month in Algeria.
 OPEC members need prices of $60 to $90 a barrel to balance their budgets, and the prospect of lower prices and revenue is daunting to many. Even Saudi Arabia, the biggest exporter, indicated that it considered $75 a barrel to be a ''fair price,'' a far higher figure than most analysts had expected from the kingdom.
 But as the Cairo meeting illustrated, there are unmistakable signs that the group was struggling to maintain unity.
 ''It is at times when the organization is under pressure that its cohesion is tested,'' said Raad Alkadiri, an energy specialist at PFC Energy, a consulting firm, who was in Cairo. ''Right now, there is a sense it's not in the driving seat.''
 The oil market has gone full circle at an astonishing speed. The factors that pushed up prices since 2003 -- surging demand, sluggish production and investors flocking to commodity markets -- have mostly disappeared.
 Dimming the prospects for oil, the global economy entered into a broad-based recession in the third quarter, according to JPMorgan Chase analysts, and will not have positive growth before the second quarter of next year, at the earliest. 
 In the United States, oil demand plunged by 2.6 million barrels a day in September, or nearly 13 percent, according to monthly figures from the Energy Department. Demand was 17.7 million barrels a day, the lowest monthly level since October 1995. 
 Overall global consumption could drop for the first time in 25 years this year and might not recover before 2011, analysts said. Some say OPEC must cut output by at least three million barrels a day to make up for declining demand in industrialized nations. 
 Behind the facade, the cartel is facing its toughest test in years. The meeting failed to resolve deep-seated issues like what each country is currently pumping and how much more the members should reduce production. Instead, producers tried to stay on message. ''OPEC is united,'' Shokri Ghanem, the oil minister from Libya, said Saturday.
 Signs of tensions remain. The Gulf states, led by Saudi Arabia, are unwilling to approve further trims before other members follow through on previous commitments to reduce output, particularly Iran and Venezuela.
 Analysts said the Saudis wanted to show just how serious it was about all cartel members sharing the burden. Even as the Saudis appear ready to play hardball, OPEC is laying the groundwork for a more coordinated approach. 
 OPEC's secretary general, Abdalla Salem el-Badri, has asked producers outside the cartel -- Russia, Mexico and Norway -- to restrain supplies, as some did in the late 1990s when prices slumped below $10 a barrel. These countries will attend the group's meeting in Algeria.
 ''Our concern is about overproduction,'' Abdullah al-Attiyah, Qatar's energy minister, said. ''If you're producing oil and no one is buying it, this is the concern.''

HEADLINE: Preserving the City: Houses of Worship Choosing to Avoid Landmark Status

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
For more than 100 years the Bay Ridge United Methodist Church, with its serpentine stone and clock tower, lent a bucolic yet dignified air to the corner of Fourth and Ovington Avenues in Brooklyn. 
 Then, on Oct. 21, a bulldozer laid waste to the structure, known as the Green Church.
 Daunted by the cost of repairing and maintaining the 1899 building, the congregation had sold it to a developer for $9.75 million. He plans to build a 70-unit apartment building, and the congregation will erect a smaller church on the site. 
 The destruction went forward even though preservationists and the area's City Council representative had repeatedly implored the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission to schedule a hearing on potential landmark status for the church, which was on the National and State Register of Historic Places. 
 Feelings on the issue ran so high that at a City Council hearing last year on the reappointment of Robert B. Tierney as chairman of the landmarks commission, the city councilman, Vincent J. Gentile, publicly berated the agency for declining to act. ''It was a part of our history in this community being torn away from us,'' Mr. Gentile said in an interview. ''The sad part is, it didn't have to be.''
 Houses of worship are among the most sensitive issues facing the landmarks commission. Mandating that a church be preserved can not only impose a heavy financial burden on a congregation, it also raises the specter of state interference with religious freedom. So the commission has been especially loath to take on churches or synagogues that don't want to be designated. 
 ''Nobody wants to be in a fight with a religious institution,'' said Peg Breen, president of the New York Landmarks Conservancy, a preservation group.
 But many preservationists and at least one commission member argue that the landmarks commission has not been aggressive enough in protecting churches from the overheated real estate market of the last few years. Given that churches tend to be low-rise buildings in choice residential locations, they note, the structures became prime targets for developers intent on building high-rise apartment towers. 
 In the last few years many houses of worship around the city have struck such construction deals, from St. Ann's Church in the East Village, which is becoming a New York University dormitory, to Congregation Shearith Israel on the Upper West Side, where apartments are to be planted atop a new community house next door. 
 West-Park Presbyterian Church, a ruddy Romanesque Revival bulwark at 86th Street and Amsterdam Avenue, has negotiated a deal to raze its church house so a developer can build a condo tower there. 
 Preservationists argue that too many religious buildings have been lost and more are at risk, even as the New York economy faces a downturn. 
 In the case of the Green Church in Bay Ridge, a landmarks commission spokeswoman cited ''advanced deterioration'' as a deciding factor in the agency's refusal to schedule a hearing. She ticked off ''severe damage to parts of the roof'' and ''the significant projected cost of repairing the building, as well as strong opposition from the congregation.'' 
 The church's pastor, the Rev. Robert Emerick, vigorously supported demolition as a strategy to enable the church to survive. ''Christianity is not about a building, it's about people doing work in the name of Christ,'' he said. ''Now we have the chance to be a real Christian church and not have to worry about fixing the roof all the time.''
 But Stephen F. Byrns, an architect who serves on the 11-member landmarks agency, says that religious buildings tend to be structural gems without strong advocates and thus demand special consideration. 
 ''To me houses of worship are incredibly important buildings that often represent the finest architecture, the noblest ambitions, the richest budgets, and they are very vulnerable,'' he said.
 Mr. Tierney defended the commission's record on houses of worship, citing 12 it has designated in his five-year tenure. Five were named individual landmarks and seven won protection as part of historic districts. (Late in October it added St. Stephen's Roman Catholic Church in Murray Hill, built in the Gothic Revival style in 1854.) 
 ''I've made it a matter of special concern,'' Mr. Tierney said. He added that he struggles to balance the need to preserve historical treasures with the economic straits of religious institutions. Dozens of churches have fallen on hard times in recent years as demographic changes in the city whittled away at their congregations. 
 ''They're constantly in need of resources to carry out the mission,'' Mr. Tierney said. ''What do you do when your entire parish is gone, and there's nobody left, and you have this marvelous building, and it's frightfully expensive to maintain?''
 Among the religious buildings designated on his watch, Mr. Tierney noted, were the first Catholic churches to become landmarks in 28 years: St. Aloysius on West 132nd Street, known for its ornamental polychrome bands of brick and terra cotta, and the Church of All Saints on East 129th Street, an imposing Gothic Revival masterpiece with wheel clerestory windows. Both won landmark status last year.
 But while preservationists applauded those designations, they said the commission bypassed even more important treasures like St. Thomas the Apostle Church in Harlem, completed in 1907 on West 118th Street near St. Nicholas Avenue. Known for its flamboyantly ornate neo-Gothic facade, fan-vaulted ceiling, spiky pinnacles and stained-glass windows, it was cited as one of the seven most important sites worth saving by the Preservation League of New York State. 
 ''My community loves this church,'' Representative Charles B. Rangel wrote in a 2004 letter to Cardinal Edward M. Egan.
 During years of pressure from Harlem advocates, the commission has declined to hold a hearing on St. Thomas, saying the building had already been significantly altered and its congregation was largely inactive. 
 Some preservationists and architectural historians accuse the commission and the New York archdiocese of grudgingly going along with the designations of All Saints and St. Aloysius in exchange for the omission of St. Thomas. 
 ''This was their bargain,'' said Michael Henry Adams, the author of ''Harlem: Lost and Found'' (Monacelli Press, 2001), a history of the neighborhood's architecture. ''To me it's like the decision of Solomon.''
 Mr. Tierney said the determination was made strictly on the merits. ''One was much, much harder to do than the other two,'' he said. ''Ultimately that was what we were able to achieve, and I think it's a significant achievement.'' 
 The archdiocese opposed designating St. Thomas on the grounds that services are no longer held there and that the building is no longer essential to its religious mission. ''It has not functioned as a Catholic church in several years,'' said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese. ''I would not think it was worthy of landmark status.''
 He said the archdiocese did not resist landmark designations for St. Aloysius or All Saints because their situation was more stable. All Saints has a school attached to it that is still operating, for example. ''We chose not to oppose the landmarking,'' Mr. Zwilling said, adding that All Saints and St. Aloysius were ''obviously deserving.''
 Mr. Zwilling emphasizes that the archdiocese in any case does not give orders to the commission. ''It would be overstating to say the landmarks commission does what we want them to do,'' he said. ''They're an independent body.''
 For preservationists one of the most striking cases that the commission declined to hear was that of St. Brigid's Roman Catholic Church on Avenue B at Eighth Street in the East Village, built in 1848 by Irish immigrants. Its main building was closed in 2001 because of structural concerns; the final Mass was said in the basement of its school next door in 2004. 
 The archdiocese said the church had outlived its usefulness, given that other churches nearby could serve parishioners and that the building was too costly to repair. 
 Opponents of St. Brigid's demolition filed a lawsuit in 2005 and another in 2006. The first suit was dismissed; the second wound its way up to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, where it is still pending. 
 In a letter to Mr. Tierney in December 2006, a group of prominent city politicians requested that the commission schedule a full hearing on St. Brigid's, citing the church's ''rich history'' and ''unusual Carpenter Gothic style.'' 
 ''St. Brigid's is structurally sound, contrary to the claims of the archdiocese,'' the petitioners said, adding that the exterior ''still bears much of its original architectural integrity.''
 But in a letter dated Jan. 22, 2007, Mr. Tierney said he and his staff had decided that the building's ''structural instability'' and changes to its original form through alterations precluded it from consideration as a historic landmark. 
 ''I know you understand that the commission must make difficult choices as we carry out our mission to protect the best of the city's treasures,'' he added. 
 In the end an anonymous donor stepped forward with a $20 million gift to allow St. Brigid's to reopen as a parish church. Work on the building is under way. 
 Sometimes a church negotiates a landmark designation that still allows it to cash in on development deals. The most prominent example is the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Morningside Heights, which persuaded the commission in 2002 to omit two parcels on the 11-acre grounds of the Episcopal cathedral from the agency's hearings calendar to allow for development. 
 To the distress of many local residents a 20-story, 300-unit rental apartment tower is approaching completion on the southeast corner of the grounds. The second parcel, along the northern edge of the campus on 113th Street, on which Columbia University has an option, has yet to be developed.
 In 2003 the landmarks commission designated the cathedral itself a landmark. In a bid to halt the building projects, the City Council overturned the designation four months later, arguing that the entire cathedral campus should be designated a landmark. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg vetoed the council's decision, but the council then overrode the veto. 
 ''St. John the Divine should be landmarked in totality,'' said Bill Perkins, who represented the area at the time on the City Council. ''It is, quite frankly, an insult to the historical value of this world-renowned church to have it piecemeal like this.'' 
 Religious groups have historically opposed designation of their buildings. In 1982 the Committee of Religious Leaders of the City of New York issued a 40-page report asserting that designating church buildings as protected landmarks was ''a threat to religious freedom.''
 ''We strongly object to the forced diversion by government of resources dedicated for religious ministry to serve instead the cause of architectural preservation,'' it said. 
 A year later a bill was introduced in the New York State Senate and Assembly exempting houses of worship from local preservation laws. The measure was defended by the New York Board of Rabbis, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York and the Council of Churches of the City of New York. But it faced fierce opposition from preservationists. It never came to a vote. 
 At West-Park Presbyterian on the Upper West Side, the active membership has dwindled to 20 who now worship at a church nearby, and homeless people camp out in the building's doorways. The pastor, the Rev. Dr. Robert L. Brashear, said he simply wanted to see his congregation endure, even if that means worshiping in a new, more modest setting. 
 ''It's not just saving one small little church,'' he said. ''It's preserving a place of active and vital ministry for the future.''

HEADLINE: Vowing to Continue Work Of Couple Killed in Attack

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY; Isabel Kershner contributed reporting from Jerusalem.

 BODY:
For many Jews, they are homes away from home: Chabad Houses, welcoming outposts in foreign lands or across the United States, places to drop in to celebrate Hanukkah, Passover or weekly Shabbat dinners. 
 Almost always, the Chabad Houses are run by young couples, emissaries of the Chabad-Lubavitch denomination, a Hasidic faith with its headquarters in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, whose adherents believe that secular Jews ought to become more observant. 
 Two of those emissaries were killed when their Chabad House was among the buildings attacked by terrorists in Mumbai last week. In their deaths, the couple, Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, 29, and his wife Rivka, 28, drew a spotlight on the Chabad faith (the terms Chabad and Lubavitch are used interchangeably) -- and to the emissaries' growing presence around the world. 
 The number of Chabad Houses has mushroomed in the last decade, and now more than 4,000 husband-and-wife couples run them in 73 countries. 
 In 2003, the Holtzbergs, newly married, opened the first Chabad House in Mumbai.
 Chabad leaders are quick to stress that the emissaries, called shluchim in Hebrew, are not missionaries. They do not try to convert non-Jews to Judaism. Instead, their mandate is to act as ''lamplighters'' by reaching out to secular Jews, often stopping people on city sidewalks and asking, ''Are you Jewish?,'' and trying to persuade them to deepen their faith.
 The Chabad faith emerged 250 years in Russia ago as a branch of Hasidism. In 1951, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson became the spiritual leader, or rebbe, and under him, outreach bloomed. 
 ''They pioneered Jewish outreach, and they developed techniques now used by other Jewish denominations,'' said Sue Fishkoff, a journalist and author of the book ''The Rebbe's Army: Inside the World of Chabad-Lubavitch.'' 
 The Holtzbergs moved to Mumbai in August 2003. Mr. Holtzberg, who was born in Israel and had moved to Brooklyn in his teens, had nursed a dream of becoming a shliach emissary. He spent time as a student in the Chabad House in Bangkok, and helped open a house in south Thailand, according to Rabbi Yosef Kantor, who oversees new branches in Southeast Asia. 
 The region sees great numbers of Israeli and Jewish travelers, and the Chabad movement wanted to expand its presence there. The Holtzbergs, it was decided, were perfect for the Mumbai job. As a student, Mr. Holtzberg was noted as a nimble thinker and, according to Rabbi Zalman Shmotkin, a spokesman for the Chabad movement in New York, for advancing Talmudic concepts. Mrs. Holtzberg seemed at once endlessly calm and energetic, said people who knew her. 
 Jewish groups are often wary when a Chabad House opens in a new city, but the Holtzbergs forged harmonious relationships in Mumbai, Ms. Fishkoff said. The couple's home in the Colaba neighborhood, a popular destination for tourists, quickly became a favorite among Jewish backpackers, who were attracted to its welcoming air, Jewish art and the shelves lined with row after row of religious books. 
 ''We talked and argued politics, discussed economics, shared our personal stories,'' Olga Daniella Bakayeva, a recent guest, wrote in a post on Chabad.org after the Holtzbergs' deaths were reported.
 A week before the terrorists attacked, the 25th annual International Conference of the Chabad-Lubavitch Emissaries began in New York. Mr. Holtzberg chose not to attend: his eldest son, who was gravely ill with a congenital disease, was in an Israeli hospital, and Mr. Holtzberg wanted to stay close to home. 
 On Thursday morning, hours after the terrorist siege began, the Holtzbergs' Indian nanny managed to escape with the couple's other child, Moshe, who turned 2 on Saturday. It was not until Saturday night that terrible images from the Chabad House, known as Nariman House, began to trickle out: photos of a blood-soaked floor of a library strewn with red-stained pages of holy books. 
 Some of the dead, including Mrs. Holtzberg, were found wrapped in prayer shawls. Witnesses speculated that the rabbi had managed to cover the bodies before he was killed. 
 The Chabad community was seized with horror and shock. They had not been so maliciously singled out in at least 50 years, Mr. Shmotkin said. 
 ''You think about those who were so selfless, they had no other life than spreading love and goodness,'' Mr. Shmotkin said. ''To have them cut down in this kind of way is really unfathomable.''
 Yet within hours after the news broke about the Holtzbergs' deaths, young Chabad couples from around the world stepped forward, offering to move to Mumbai and continue the movement's work. 
 Chabad leaders said the Mumbai house would be certain to reopen.

PERSON: Doris Dungey 

HEADLINE: Doris Dungey, 47, Prescient Finance Blogger

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
The blogger Tanta, an influential voice on the mortgage collapse, died Sunday morning in Columbus, Ohio. 
 Tanta, who wrote for Calculated Risk, a finance and economics blog, was a pseudonym for Doris Dungey, 47, who until recently had lived in Upper Marlboro, Md. The cause of death was ovarian cancer, her sister, Cathy Stickelmaier, said. 
 Thanks in large part to Tanta's contributions, Calculated Risk became a crucial source of prescient analysis as the housing market at first faltered, then collapsed and finally spawned a full-blown credit crisis. 
 Tanta used her extensive knowledge of the loan industry to comment, castigate and above all instruct. Her fans ranged from the Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times who cited her in his blog, to analysts at the Federal Reserve, who cited her in a paper on ''Understanding the Securitization of Subprime Mortgage Credit.''
 She wrote under a pseudonym because she hoped some day to go back to work in the mortgage industry, and the increasing renown of Tanta in that world might have precluded that. Tanta was Ms. Dungey's longtime family nickname, Ms. Stickelmaier said.
 Calculated Risk, which gets about 75,000 visitors a day, was started in early 2005 by a retired technology executive named Bill McBride. The housing market was soaring, but Mr. McBride sensed that the industry was about to peak, and he posted articles and data that made his case.
 The blog quickly drew a lively and informed group of commentators, few livelier and none more informed than someone who called herself Tanta. She began by correcting some of Mr. McBride's posts. ''She would tell me either I was wrong or the article I was quoting was wrong,'' he said Sunday. ''It was clear she really knew her stuff. And she was funny about it.''
 Tanta soon graduated from merely commenting to being a full-scale partner. Her first post, in December 2006, took issue with an optimistic Citigroup report that maintained that the mortgage industry would ''rationalize'' in 2007, to the benefit of larger players like, well, Citigroup.
 ''Bear with me while I ask some stupid questions,'' Tanta wrote, and proceeded to assert that the industry was less likely to ''rationalize'' than fall apart, which it did. Citigroup was bailed out by the government last month.
 She loved the intricacies of mortgage financing and would joke about being not just a nerd on the subject but a nerd's nerd. She eventually wrote, for the Calculated Risk site, ''The Compleat UberNerd,'' 13 lengthy articles on mortgage origination channels, mortgage-backed securities and foreclosures that constituted a definitive word on the subject.
 The rest of the time, Tanta liked to chew on the follies of regulators, the idiocies of lenders and -- a particular favorite -- clueless reporters, which according to her was just about all of them. She did not approve, she once wrote, of ''parading one's ignorance about mortgages in an article full of high-minded tut-tutting over ignorance about mortgages.''
 In March 2006, Ms. Dungey was diagnosed with late-stage ovarian cancer. 
 Ms. Dungey was raised in Bloomington-Normal, Ill., had a graduate degree in English, and worked as a writer and trainer for a variety of lenders, including Champion Federal and AmerUs Mortgage. 
 One of Tanta's last posts was written as the $700 billion bailout was first being debated in mid-September, and it seemed that the Treasury Department might buy bad assets directly from troubled banks.
 Tanta argued that for every asset that banks unloaded on the government, the chief executives should be required to explain ''why they acquired or originated this asset to begin with, what's really wrong with it in detail, what they have learned from this experience, and what steps they are taking to make sure it never happens again.''

HEADLINE: In Hard Times for TV Anchors, Trusted Older Faces Fade Out

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
One of the most familiar voices in Denver is about to sign off for the last time.
 In October, three weeks after Ernie Bjorkman, an institution in Colorado television, signed a new annual contract worth close to a quarter of a million dollars, he was told he was being let go by KWGN, the CW affiliate in Denver, a victim of consolidation with another station.
 In the self-assured baritone of his profession, Mr. Bjorkman, a 36-year television veteran who will be paid through the end of his contract period, said, ''I don't think we're going to see the anchor people grow old with the audience anymore.''
 Across the country, longtime local TV anchors are a dying breed. Facing an economic slump and a severe advertising downturn, many stations have cut costs drastically in the last year, and veteran anchors, with their expensive contracts, seem to be shouldering a disproportionate share of the cutbacks. When station managers are forced to make cuts, hefty anchor salaries are a tempting target. 
 In Chicago, the 23-year anchor Diann Burns was laid off from WBBM. In Boston, the renowned sports anchor Bob Lobel was let go by WBZ. In Houston, the 26-year veteran Carolyn Campbell was dismissed from KHOU. 
 When the anchors depart, they take decades of experience and insight with them. ''Basically, you replace someone who knows City Hall with someone who can't find it,'' said John Beard, who lost his job at KTTV last December after 26 years as a news anchor in Los Angeles.
 Almost all of the country's 1,300 television stations with network affiliations have a face, or a pair of faces, that represent their news operations better than any logo or commercial can. Many years after signing off, the larger-than-life characters are still fixtures of newscast lore, like Bill Beutel in New York, Fahey Flynn in Chicago and Ann Bishop in Miami.
 While some anchors in top markets can still command million-dollar salaries -- like Chuck Scarborough and Sue Simmons on WNBC in New York -- the positions are becoming more vulnerable to the market forces that are roiling local TV, analysts say. 
 ''There is certainly an erosion of longtime anchors happening at many stations across the country, for a very simple reason: economics,'' said Al Primo, a television news consultant who developed the ''Eyewitness News'' format in the 1960s and 1970s.
 Mr. Primo says anchors' salaries now seem ''out of sync with the reality'' of budgets. As stations record lower revenue, managers are trying to adjust anchor salaries accordingly.
 ''We've been aggressive in our cost controls,'' said Peter Diaz, the executive vice president of the Belo Corporation, which instituted a companywide wage freeze at its 20 TV stations in mid-November. Although anchors have separate contracts, they have been asked to participate in the freeze, and many have agreed, he said.
 Local TV, although it lacks the glamour of the network nightly news or the prestige of print newspapers, remains the most popular single source of news in the United States. Slightly more than half of the population watches local news regularly, according to the Pew Research Center for People and the Press, while only 34 percent read a newspaper each day and 29 percent watch a network evening newscast. 
 But the ratings for the broadcasts have gradually eroded over the years. The typical late newscast now reaches 12 percent of viewers watching TV in a given market, down from 21 percent 10 years ago.
 The news departments are not alone in feeling the squeeze. Advertising is falling sharply, partly because of cutbacks in spending by automakers and car dealerships, which represent the single largest category of advertiser for broadcasters. 
 Until mid-November, a trade association for stations, the Television Bureau of Advertising, had expected total commercial revenue to be flat compared with 2007. It revised the forecast, however, and predicted a 7.1 percent decline. The group expects a 7 to 11 percent decrease in revenue next year. Already, the financial pressures are trickling down to newsrooms.
 ''The conditions are as bad as I've ever seen, and I've been on TV since 1980,'' said Rich Rodriguez, who is 54 and has anchored newscasts for 20 years, most recently at KSEE in Fresno, Calif. He was laid off in October. When the station's general manager asked him to take a 25 percent pay cut, Mr. Rodriguez refused. He was fired the same day his first grandchild was born.
 ''It's scary for people over 50,'' he said. 
 Many stations -- and viewers -- still place a premium on the gravitas that older anchors provide. But confronted by the era of always-available news and information on the Internet, local stations are being forced to rethink their mission. 
 On the Web, users can assemble their own newscast from an around-the-clock buffet of options, making anchors seem somewhat superfluous, especially to younger viewers. Perhaps as a result, station layoffs are in the news almost every day now, said Tom Petner, who edits the television industry newsletter ShopTalk. 
 ''The industry is moving from star players to more of a team sport,'' he said. 
 News is still a profit center for many local TV owners; it represents about 40 percent of an average station's revenue. But as that revenue shrinks, local news operations have automated many of their technical operations and spread their staffs ever more thinly. 
 ''There aren't a lot of bodies left to cut, unless you scale back newscasts,'' said Robert Papper, chairman of Hofstra University's journalism department. After surveying 300 newsrooms last summer, Mr. Papper projected that about 360 local TV news jobs had been lost this year. (That represents only a small fraction of the thousands of journalists laid off by newspapers, though TV news operates with a much smaller base of employees.) 
 Mr. Papper says longtime anchors at top-rated stations in local markets are at little risk of being laid off. But ''if I were a very highly paid anchor of a No. 3 station, I'd be really nervous,'' he said. 
 Looking forward, Mr. Bjorkman, the Colorado newsman, says he doubts that many TV anchors will manage to stay in the same market for decades. He expects more mergers, consolidations and cost-cutting as local news grapples with competition online and on digital channels. 
 His last day in local TV will be Dec. 31. Presciently, Mr. Bjorkman, 57, started taking veterinary technician classes two years ago, acting on a decades-old dream of working with animals. While Mr. Bjorkman has been performing his veterinary internships, some residents have recognized him, and a few have wondered whether he was working undercover on an investigative reporting assignment. 
 He has explained to them, this will be his new full-time assignment. He finished his course work in September, two weeks before he found out he would lose his anchor job. ''I'm ready to reinvent myself,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Deep Discounts Draw Shoppers, But Not Profits

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM; Rebecca Cathcart and Abha Bhattarai contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Sales in the nation's stores were strong over the weekend, to the relief of retailers that had been expecting a holiday shopping period as slow as the overall economy. 
 But while spending was up, there were troubling signs in the early numbers. The bargains that drove shoppers to stores were so stunning, analysts said that retailers -- already suffering from double-digit sales declines the last two months -- would probably see their profits erode even further.
 Also, after shoppers flooded stores on Friday, foot traffic trailed off significantly on Saturday and Sunday.
 Retailing professionals consider the weekend after Thanksgiving a barometer of overall holiday sales, which account for 25 to 40 percent of their annual sales. And in a year marked by an economic crisis, they are desperate for any signs that consumers are still willing to spend. 
 Their first glimpse came from two industry surveys released on Sunday. ShopperTrak, which does research for retailers, said sales increased 3 percent on Friday, compared with last year. 
 The National Retail Federation, adding up sales Thursday through Saturday and projected sales for Sunday, said that each shopper spent about 7 percent more this year than last year. Shoppers spent an average of $372.57 Friday though Sunday, according to the federation, a trade group.
 ''It seems that not only did retailers do a good job of attracting shoppers but it seems that shoppers were also excited again to take part in the tradition of Black Friday weekend,'' said Kathy Grannis, a spokeswoman for the federation.
 That study also showed that Friday was by far the busiest day of the weekend, with traffic trailing off by more than 16 million people on Saturday.
 Analysts said the discounts that drew in shoppers over the weekend were so steep that many ailing chains might be no better off in the long run. 
 ''You're looking at discounts of 50 to 70 percent off,'' said Matthew Katz, managing director in the retail practice of Alix Partners, an advisory and restructuring firm. ''You have to sell two to three times as much to break even.'' 
 Chains as varied as Target and Neiman Marcus offered goods at some of their lowest prices ever. At Target, a 26-inch LCD HD-TV, originally $429.99, was selling for $299. Last week Tracy Mullin, president and chief executive of the National Retail Federation, noted that ''this could be the most heavily promotional Black Friday in history.'' 
 And those promotions came on top of already radical price cuts. 
 ''There is a sense of desperation among retailers,'' said Hana Ben-Shabat, a partner in A. T. Kearney's retail practice, ''because everybody knows consumers are very stretched.'' 
 As Marshal Cohen, chief industry analyst for the NPD Group, put it: ''This weekend was like having a huge party and just hoping anybody shows up.''
 Even with the cheery news from industry groups, many retailing professionals worry the shorter holiday shopping season, on top of an ailing economy, will hurt sales through Christmas. There are 27 shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year; there were 32 last year. Bill Martin, co-founder of ShopperTrak, said the abbreviated season ''may catch some procrastinating consumers off guard, leading to lower sales levels.'' 
 Also potentially troubling for retailers is that consumers say they are further along in their holiday shopping -- on average, 39.3 percent done versus 36.4 percent a year ago, according to the National Retail Federation, whose survey was conducted by BIGresearch.
 Already, stores had seen double-digit sales declines in the first two weeks of November, according to SpendingPulse, a report by MasterCard Advisors. Michael McNamara, vice president of SpendingPulse, said sectors like electronics and luxury goods declined by more than 19 percent versus the period a year ago. 
 But both ShopperTrak and the National Retail Federation said Friday was a reminder that shopping remained an American pastime. ShopperTrak said foot traffic was up almost 2 percent, though its estimate for the full holiday season is a nearly 10 percent plunge in sales compared with last year. 
 The National Retail Federation said some 172 million shoppers visited stores and Web sites over Thanksgiving weekend, up from 147 million shoppers last year. 
 Most people shopped at discount stores. But in what must be welcome news for struggling department stores, about 11 percent more consumers shopped at them this year than last year. 
 Over all, though, most shoppers ended up buying lower-cost items: clothes, accessories, video games, DVDs, and CDs. Gift cards were down 10 percent, perhaps in part because of concerns about retail bankruptcies. 
 Despite the industry surveys' findings, many consumers and longtime retailing analysts attested to lighter crowds. 
 ''There was definitely more elbow room,'' said John D. Morris, a Wachovia analyst whose retail team fanned out at malls across the country on Friday. 
 Mr. Cohen of the NPD Group said that on Friday foot traffic at stores was down 11 percent and the shopping bag count was down 24 percent compared with last year.
 In online retailing, comScore said spending for the first 28 days of November declined 4 percent, to $10.4 billion, compared with $10.8 billion for the period a year ago. Online spending on Friday bumped up 1 percent, to $534 million, compared with $531 million last year.
 Retailers did not report Friday sales on Sunday; most will wrap them into their November sales reports on Thursday. 
 J. C. Penney, for instance, said in a statement on Saturday that ''in light of the challenging and volatile economic climate, and shifts in this year's retail calendar, we don't believe that reporting sales data for any one day (or weekend), including Black Friday, would provide a meaningful barometer of our business.'' 
 Black Friday is named for the day when, historically, retailers moved into the black, or became profitable for the year. Retailing professionals now use the whole holiday shopping season, November through December, to help determine the health of a retailer. 
 Mr. Martin of ShopperTrak cautioned that Black Friday ''is just one day'' and said he was not changing his prediction for flat holiday sales this year. 
 Other retailing groups have predicted sales declines. Standard & Poor's Equity Research Services estimated a 5 percent drop. IBISWorld, a research firm, said overall holiday spending would sink by about 3 percent.
 In the wee hours of Friday morning, retailers were optimistic. 
 In the Herald Square area of Manhattan, the head of Macy's, Terry J. Lundgren, said he was feeling ''very encouraged that customers are out,'' as he stood amid a swirl of bleary-eyed shoppers. There were about 5,000 people lined up outside before 5 a.m. Friday, he said, about the same as last year. ''We're all anxious to see how the customer responds.'' 
 By Saturday, consumers said the frenzy -- which resulted the death of a Wal-Mart worker in suburban New York when shopping commenced on Friday morning -- that had accompanied the weekend's limited-time jaw-dropping deals was gone. 
 ''The parking lot didn't have a lot of cars in it, so it was easy to find a spot up front,'' said Kimi Armstrong as she wandered around the Domain, an upscale shopping center in Austin, Texas. ''At this exact time last year it was raining, but the sidewalks were packed with people. It was wall-to-wall people. It was hard to walk down the sidewalk without running into anybody.''
 Some shoppers, including Ms. Armstrong, hit the stores over the weekend just to partake of the Christmas spirit, brainstorm gift ideas or check deals that many expected to improve in the weeks to come. 
 On a bench in front of a Macy's store in Century City, Calif., Jill Capanna, 47, was eating frozen yogurt with her family. It was their only purchase after having wandered the mall for three hours. ''Normally we buy presents way ahead of time,'' Ms. Capanna said, ''but this year I'm waiting until the last minute.''
 At Westfield Century City Shopping Center in California, Harper Mance, 31, said: ''I'm looking around, thinking, 'If there are discounts on everything now, what's it going to be like after Christmas?' You know it's going to go down further.''
 Ms. Mance's mother, Zoe, 59, agreed. ''They'll be paying us to take things after Christmas,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Each Player In Big Three Is Devising Its Own Plan

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The Detroit automakers have been lumped together for decades as the Big Three, and for good reason; their goals have usually been aligned.
 But this week, as the automakers take a second run at Congress, hoping to persuade lawmakers to give them $25 billion in federal aid, their agendas are diverging as they contemplate futures as drastically different car companies. 
 Those differences will become clear as they deliver more detailed plans for how they would use that money not just to survive, but also to turn themselves around to be competitive in the long term. 
 That should make for a sharp contrast to the hearings two weeks ago, when the executives presented a united front, saying in lockstep that it was the credit crisis and weak economy, not their strategies, that had put them in dire straits. 
 General Motors, the biggest of the troubled car companies, is expected to propose a significant shrinking of its North American operations, including shutting more factories and streamlining its sprawling brand lineup, according to people with knowledge of G.M.'s deliberations.
 One move under discussion, for example, would have G.M. buy out dealers that exclusively sell Saturns and market the cars through its Buick-Pontiac-GMC dealers instead, according to these people. 
 G.M. is also likely to propose moves that would require cooperation from the United Automobile Workers union, including delaying the company's $7 billion payment to the union's retiree health care fund.
 The Ford Motor Company, however, is not likely to propose more cuts, as it is further along than Chrysler and G.M. in shifting to a more fuel-efficient lineup of vehicles. It also has more cash to weather the downturn. Instead, people with knowledge of Ford's strategy say the automaker is considering more symbolic moves, including reducing the pay of its chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, who earned more than $21 million last year.
 The third automaker, Chrysler, which is privately owned, has acknowledged it is running out of cash and may tell Congress that it needs a merger or alliance with another company to survive long term.
 The U.A.W., whose members build cars for all three companies, is not involved in developing any of the plans, even though its political influence is a crucial factor in whether a bailout gets approved.
 On Tuesday, G.M., Ford and Chrysler are scheduled to deliver separate aid requests to lawmakers, who will hold hearings on the plans later in the week.
 The critical components in each of the plans will be how the companies expect to spend their share of the money, and what changes each automaker will make to shore up their faltering operations.
 ''We need to understand what this money is going to be used for and why it makes sense for the American people to invest in these companies,'' said Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, in an appearance on ''Fox News Sunday.''
 At the forefront is G.M., whose board began a two-day meeting on Sunday to complete its aid request.
 G.M., which has lost more than $20 billion so far this year, is asking for up to $12 billion to keep its operations running through 2009.
 The company has suffered a steep decline in revenue this year, in what has been the worst market for vehicle sales in the United States since the early 1990s.
 G.M. has previously announced huge cuts, including a 30 percent reduction in white-collar costs and the elimination of health care for salaried retirees.
 But the company, under the direction of its embattled chairman, Rick Wagoner, is expected to reorganize further to win over skeptical lawmakers.
 People with knowledge of G.M.'s plans say the automaker may eliminate one or more of its eight domestic brands and downsize its manufacturing capacity to match its shrinking market share.
 ''It's clear that G.M. has to shrink, but the bigger question is, How does the company change its structure and do business if it gets smaller?'' said John Casesa, a principal in the automotive consulting firm the Casesa Shapiro Group. 
 The union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, said Sunday that his members were prepared to reopen bargaining on terms of their contract. But he said the automakers needed to share in any sacrifice by limiting executive pay and other compensation.
 ''They need to establish that executive compensation is something that they're willing to curtail, as well as bonuses and golden parachutes on exiting the business,'' he said on the CNN program ''Late Edition.''
 During the first round of Congressional hearings on the bailout last month, Mr. Wagoner and his counterpart at Ford, Mr. Mulally, declined to say whether they would cut their salaries. Chrysler's chairman, Robert L. Nardelli, said he would consider taking a nominal $1-a-year salary.
 All three executives were also roundly criticized for flying to Washington on corporate jets. The companies have said that the chief executives will find other means of traveling to this week's hearings.
 While G.M. will lay out specific changes in its future business plans, Ford is expected to detail its efforts to transform itself from primarily a manufacturer of larger vehicles into a producer of smaller, more fuel-efficient passenger cars.
 Both G.M. and Ford are using up more than $2 billion in cash a month, but Ford has greater cash reserves -- $18.9 billion compared with $16.2 billion at G.M. -- and a $10.7 billion line of credit from private banks to carry it at least through 2009.
 Because it is in better financial shape, Ford is not asking for an immediate infusion of government money. Instead, the company will seek access to about $7 billion in federal aid only if its own cash runs out.
 ''Our position is different,'' Ford's executive chairman, William C. Ford Jr., said in a recent interview. ''Our position is what we'd like to have is access to a line of credit if we need it. And we hope not to need it.''
 Still, people familiar with Ford's strategy say the company is mulling whether to offer concessions to gain Congressional support -- including cutting Mr. Mulally's salary.
 Of the three automakers, Chrysler may have the most difficult case to make for government assistance.
 Because its majority owner, Cerberus Capital Management, is a private firm, Chrysler is not required to make public financial data like revenue and earnings.
 During the last hearings, Mr. Nardelli revealed under questioning that Chrysler was spending more than $1 billion in cash a month and had already studied the possibility of filing for bankruptcy.
 In an e-mail message to employees last week, Mr. Nardelli said its explanation for how it would use $7 billion in government loans was a simple one. ''In short, the money would be used to support our ongoing operations,'' he wrote.
 But to get support from lawmakers, Chrysler will probably have to open its books to Congress and lay out its longer-term business plans.
 ''We have to know what the financials are internally, particularly Chrysler, since it's a private company,'' Ms. McCaskill said.
 Chrysler is expected to reiterate its overall strategy to pursue alliances and partnerships with other automakers to defray the costs of developing new vehicles.
 The company had been in merger talks with G.M. until Nov. 7, when G.M. canceled the discussions to focus on its own deteriorating financial conditions.
 People knowledgeable about Chrysler's plan said Mr. Nardelli might suggest that a merger was still the company's best opportunity to survive long term.
 Executives from all three companies have said that setting a positive tone at the hearings is critical to winning support from lawmakers.
 After coming to the previous hearings seemingly unprepared, the Big Three will go into detail on gains they have made in cutting jobs and plant capacity, developing more fuel-efficient cars and investing in alternative technologies like electric vehicles.
 But the companies will mostly focus on their own efforts to change, rather than their collective transformation.
 People close to the Big Three said there were no plans yet for the chiefs of G.M., Ford and Chrysler to share details of their testimonies with one another. And each company has been assured by Congressional leaders that any proprietary information will be kept confidential.

HEADLINE: Autoworkers Fear Prospect Of Givebacks

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Mary M. Chapman contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Two years ago, Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Automobile Workers union, offered a grim prognosis for the auto industry to union members at the group's convention in Las Vegas.
 ''This isn't a cyclical downturn,'' Mr. Gettelfinger told the silent crowd. ''The kinds of challenges we face aren't the kind that can be ridden out. They're structural challenges and they require new and farsighted solutions.''
 Now Mr. Gettelfinger and his union, representing 139,000 workers at the Detroit carmakers, are under pressure to find more drastic solutions that even he could not have anticipated. Since the U.A.W.'s 2006 convention, Detroit automakers have lost more than $80 billion, including one-time charges, and shed more than 119,000 workers. 
 Even more urgently, the soft economy and credit crisis have pushed Detroit into free fall. General Motors and Chrysler are going through cash so quickly that many analysts say they believe both may wind up in bankruptcy, and those carmakers, along with Ford Motor, have asked Congress for help. 
 This week, they will present plans to make their case that any money from the government will be well spent.
 In the days leading up to the bailout hearings two weeks ago, and during his testimony before Congress, Mr. Gettelfinger insisted the U.A.W. would not make further concessions on top of those granted the carmakers in recent years.
 ''The U.A.W. can't be the low-hanging fruit,'' he said during a Senate hearing on Nov. 18, where he joined car company executives in asking for government loans. ''While we're at the table, we're asking that others come in and sacrifice as well.'' 
 Later, at a Detroit news conference, he declined to predict what Congress might seek. ''Let's wait and see,'' he told reporters, ''and then we'll make a decision at that point in time.''
 But any collective plans from Detroit, if they are to win over Congress, may require additional cost-saving concessions from the U.A.W.
 While the union has not agreed to reopen contracts at General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, industry analysts say it seems inevitable that it will have to do so, and that some of the U.A.W.'s hardest-fought gains may shrink, if not completely disappear.
 ''He can't keep anything off the table,'' said David L. Gregory, a professor of labor studies at St. John's University in Queens. ''In many ways, it's the end of the dream of the post-World War II work force.''
 Even one of the union's biggest supporters, President-elect Barack Obama, foresaw the current situation in his own speech to the union convention in 2006.
 ''I need for all of you to fight for the future,'' Mr. Obama, then a United States senator from Illinois, told delegates via satellite. ''I need all of you to be open to creative ways of doing business. None of us can afford to watch the American auto industry fail.''
 It is a message he has repeated in recent weeks, in urging Congress to approve assistance money. Mr. Obama has also insisted, however, that the auto companies should not receive a ''blank check.''
 If history is any guide, the union may be told by lawmakers to agree to hundreds of millions of dollars more in cuts if the carmakers are to get their money.
 That is what lawmakers demanded in 1979 during deliberations over loan guarantees that were granted to Chrysler. The U.A.W. eventually agreed to an additional $259 million in concessions, in the form of wage and benefit cuts, on top of $203 million in givebacks granted during contract negotiations.
 In last year's contract negotiations, the U.A.W. agreed to a series of cuts aimed at helping the struggling auto companies, including a two-tier wage system that pays sharply lower rates to newly hired workers, as well as those in jobs away from the assembly line. Some union officials echo Mr. Gettelfinger's comments that those cuts, which are still being adopted, were enough.
 ''People have to realize that we've just been through a lot of concessions,'' said Eldon Renaud, president of Local 2164 in Bowling Green, Ky.
 But Mr. Renaud said he was sure Mr. Gettelfinger and union leaders were ''keeping an open mind, because the bottom line is that we're all in this together.''
 Mr. Renaud was working in the U.A.W.'s political action group during the 1979 bailout, and recalled that heated debate. ''People were saying, 'Let it go down.' But Americans realized then, and they will again this time, that the country has to have a strong manufacturing sector,'' Mr. Renaud said.
 A U.A.W. spokesman declined to comment on the nature of Mr. Gettelfinger's talks with leaders of the Detroit auto companies.
 For any cuts to take place, union officials presumably will have to agree to reopen contracts with each auto company, and presumably negotiate separate deals. 
 Among the possible areas that could be cut is a program that pays workers whose jobs have been eliminated until they can find work at other factories.
 In the past, there have been thousands of workers at each company in the program, called the Jobs Bank at G.M. But it was altered in the 2007 contracts to reduce benefits, and the program currently covers only 3,591 workers at the three companies, Mr. Gettelfinger said at the news conference last week.
 The Big Three also may ask to delay the billions of dollars they planned to contribute to a health care fund called a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association, or VEBA, that was meant to shift their burden for retiree health care benefits, which would then be up to VEBA to administer.
 Some critics have taken aim at the automakers' hourly labor costs, which average more than $70 for senior workers, including wages and the value of benefits like pensions and health care.
 Those costs run closer to $46 an hour at nonunion plants like Toyota's factory in Georgetown, Ky., and are even less at newer plants farther South, where foreign automakers have pegged wages closer to local rates.
 Heath care and pensions seem to be the biggest hot buttons for U.A.W. members, including Doug Hanscom, who has worked at G.M.'s plant in Wilmington, Del., for 32 years.
 ''I know one thing: If I lose my pension, I bet you Rick Wagoner'' -- the G.M. chief executive -- ''and all those guys won't lose theirs,'' said Mr. Hanscom, 56, who plans to retire in 2010.
 He called Mr. Gettelfinger's decision to ask for assistance alongside Detroit executives ''a big disappointment.'' Mr. Hanscom added, ''It seems like he's championing more for the corporations than his own membership.''
 But others seem resigned. Brian Fredline, president of Local 602 in Lansing, said: ''I guess nothing is untouchable. I just hope the companies don't touch too much of it.''

HEADLINE: Q & A with Stuart Elliott

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
(Stuart Elliott)
 I recently received questions from two readers about the same advertising campaign. The questions follow below, then the answer.
 Q: (Reader)
 Every time I see one of those Volkswagen ads about women having babies for German engineering, the first thing that comes to mind is ''What were they thinking?'' -- Volkswagen and its advertising firm, I mean, not the pregnant women in the ads.
 I can't tell you which model of VW is being advertised, but I guess they are building name recognition for the VW brand. And I know that even bad PR is PR. But these ads just strike me as perverse, even creepy. What are they trying to do? 
 Q: (Reader)
 After reading this week's newsletter with a number of comments from readers who have been offended by certain advertisements, I am encouraged to mention one that I find slightly inexplicable and genuinely creepy: the recent Volkswagen campaign in which Brooke Shields is the spokeswoman for the Routan.
 She presents herself as an advocate for thoughtful parenting, begging potential Routan buyers not to procreate for the sole purpose of owning a Routan. I suppose the ''joke'' makes a certain sense if the Routan is a family-oriented car, although I'm not sure that this is the case.
 Whether the point of the ad is amusing or not, it seems to border on insensitivity -- and not in a happy way. The fact that Ms. Shields herself wrote a heartfelt book about post-partum depression makes her a particularly unhappy choice, in spite of her personal attractiveness. Am I the only person who finds this ad campaign unsuccessful?
 A: (Stuart Elliott)
 The tongue-in-cheek campaign for the Volkswagen Routan, which is a minivan aimed at families, presents Ms. Shields confronting expectant couples and chiding them for wanting to be parents just so they can experience the ''German engineering'' of the Routan. Some of the criticism of the ads is centered on the unsavory aspects of Germany's breeding programs during the Hitler era. Other critics perceive the campaign as insensitive to infertile couples.
 The ads are being created by Crispin Porter & Bogusky in Miami and Boulder, Colo., an agency owned by MDC Partners. The agency refers questions about the campaign to the client, Volkswagen of America, which offers a reply from a spokesman at its Herndon, Va., office, Steve Keyes.
 ''Advertising has the power to elicit a wide range of emotions,'' Mr. Keyes writes in an e-mail message. ''As with most of our ads, we've heard from consumers who have expressed different opinions about the current campaign.''
 ''The intended premise of the ads was based on the fact that the U.S. is experiencing a baby boom,'' Mr. Keyes says, and ''at the same time, Volkswagen is introducing a new minivan to the market.''
 ''The intent was to make the point that 'you don't have to have a baby to justify the purchase of the new Volkswagen minivan,' '' he adds. ''Years of research confirms that consumers equate 'German engineering' with precision, quality, being well-made and reliability and in the case of automobiles, it also signals improved driving dynamics, superior braking, acceleration and safety.'' 
 Q: (Reader)
 Re: Your piece on the lame, cliche-ridden Gold's campaign on Nov. 17. I've seen better campaigns come out of first-year students in ad school.
 I especially liked this line: ''The concept is intended to resonate at a time when consumers are seeking strength, internal and external, as a result of the sudden weakness displayed by once-powerful institutions like A.I.G., Bear Stearns, Fannie Mae and Washington Mutual.''
 It's obvious that you are just regurgitating press releases. But is it out of laziness, a favor or have you have lost touch with reality?
 A: (Stuart Elliott)
 Dear reader, I think you ought to know that someone has hacked into your e-mail account and is sending out crank messages under your name.
 (With a tip of the cap to Stephen M. Young, a Democratic senator from Ohio, from whose acerbic replies to constituent letters that was adapted. Another of his responses went like this: ''Some idiot sent me this letter and signed your name to it.'')

HEADLINE: With Thanksgiving in the Past, Moviegoers Turn to a Christmas Comedy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
''Four Christmases,'' a holiday comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon, led the box office with about $31.7 million in ticket sales for Warner Brothers and its New Line unit on a solid post-Thanksgiving weekend. 
 The period romance ''Australia,'' which was directed by Baz Luhrmann and stars Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, appeared to place fifth for the weekend with just $14.8 million in domestic sales for 20th Century Fox. The film, which according to a number of reports cost about $130 million, took in $20 million since opening on Wednesday.
 Chris Aronson, a senior vice president with the studio, said he believed the opening promised a strong run through the holiday season, when movies tend to remain in theaters for many weeks. ''These are great numbers for an adult film,'' Mr. Aronson said.
 ''Twilight,'' the teen vampire phenomenon from Summit Entertainment, was No. 2 with $26.4 million in sales and $119.7 million since it opened on Nov. 21.
 ''Bolt,'' from the Walt Disney Company, was No. 3 for the weekend with about $25.5 million in sales, for a total of $67 million since its opening, also on Nov. 21.
 The Top 12 films had roughly $155 million in weekend sales, based on preliminary estimates, up slightly from about $152 million for the post-Thanksgiving period in 2007. The overall box office has been running just ahead of last year's thanks to price inflation, though the number of tickets sold has been down slightly.
 Other top-ranked films for the weekend included ''Quantum of Solace,'' which took in about $19.4 million for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Sony Pictures Entertainment to place fourth. The film has taken in about $142 million at the domestic box office since opening on Nov. 14. 
 By early estimates, ''Australia'' was closely followed by ''Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa,'' which was made by DreamWorks Animation and distributed by Paramount. That film, released on Nov. 7, took in about $14.5 million, for total of $160 million. 
 ''Transporter 3,'' from Lionsgate, placed seventh for the weekend with $12.3 million in sales and $18.5 million since opening. 
 One of the weekend's brightest prospects proved to be ''Milk,'' about Harvey Milk, the gay-rights advocate murdered in San Francisco in 1978. The film, directed by Gus Van Sant and starring Sean Penn, placed 10th with $1.4 million for Focus Features, though it played in only 36 theaters. The picture, one of the year's stronger Oscar contenders, is expected to run in an expanding number theaters throughout December. Since opening on Wednesday it took in $1.9 million.
 ''Four Christmases,'' which has earned $46.7 million since opening Wednesday, did well across the country and showed particular strength with families, said Dan Fellman, Warner's president for theatrical distribution. ''We didn't have any weak spots,'' he said.

 The Starbucks Coffee Company, Seattle, is expanding its relationship with BBDO Worldwide, New York, part of the Omnicom Group, by naming BBDO New York the agency of record for the Starbucks brand. The assignment, with spending estimated at $60 million, had been handled by Wieden & Kennedy, Portland, Ore. BBDO New York already creates campaigns for the beverages jointly sold by Starbucks Coffee and PepsiCo, like DoubleShot and Frappucino. The assignment for the Starbucks brand came after BBDO New York produced a project for the brand, centered on voting and Election Day. 
 People
 Robert Lerwill, chief executive at the Aegis Group, London, resigned unexpectedly. His duties will be assumed for now by John Napier, chairman. Aegis has been fending off a slow-moving takeover bid by Vincent Bollore, the chairman at Havas, and recently lost a major client for media planning and buying, Renault, to the OMD unit of the Omnicom Group.
 Tham Khai Meng, co-chairman and regional executive creative director for the Asian-Pacific operations of Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide, based in Singapore, was promoted to worldwide creative director and chairman of the worldwide creative council, based in New York. He succeeds Robyn Putter, who left after 32 years at Ogilvy to ''move on to the next chapter of his career,'' the agency said. Ogilvy is part of the WPP Group.
 Chris Neel, vice president at the Los Angeles office of Initiative, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, was promoted to senior vice president and director for national broadcast. He will continue his previous duties overseeing clients like Lionsgate while taking on a larger role managing the national broadcast department in the office.
 Miscellany
 The Katz Radio Group, New York, signed national sales representation agreements with two additional clients of Interep, which is liquidating under Chapter 7 of the federal bankruptcy code. The clients are the CBS Radio unit of the CBS Corporation and Entercom Communications; they join former Interep clients being represented by Katz that include Citadel Broadcasting.
 eMarketer reduced its estimate for the growth of online advertising spending in 2009. Rather than an increase of 14 percent compared with this year, as was forecast in August, the company now projects an increase of 8.9 percent. The decrease reflects the deterioration of the American economy since the previous forecast.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Be Introduced as Part of Obama Security Team

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday will seal their rapprochement when he announces her nomination as his secretary of state, Democrats close to the process said Sunday. 
 Mrs. Clinton, once considered the Democratic frontrunner for president, is flying to Chicago to appear together with the man who beat her for the nomination, a person close to Mrs. Clinton said. The sight of them together, as she joins his administration, would have been thought unlikely just weeks ago, but Mr. Obama concluded she would strengthen his team.
 At a time when the country remains engaged in two wars and still faces the threat of international terrorism, Mrs. Clinton will anchor a national security team with more of a centrist character than some of Mr. Obama's liberal supporters once hoped to see. In addition to her, Democrats said, Mr. Obama plans to announce that he is keeping Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, who has run the Pentagon for the last two years, and will appoint Gen. James L. Jones, a retired Marine commandant, as national security adviser.
 Rounding out his national security team, Mr. Obama will name former Deputy Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. as his choice for attorney general and Governor Janet Napolitano of Arizona as secretary of homeland security, the Democrats said. Mr. Obama also will nominate Susan E. Rice, his foreign policy adviser and a former assistant secretary of state, as ambassador to the United Nations, a job that will be given cabinet rank, as it had under President Bill Clinton.
 The Obama and Clinton teams have been preparing the ground for this announcement for days. Mr. Clinton, who has extensive business and philanthropic interests around the world, agreed to a nine-point plan covering disclosure, vetting and other areas to avoid potential conflicts of interest, including for the first time the release of more than 200,000 donors to his foundation by the end of the year. That goes beyond the requirements of existing law.
 The Obama team has planned for a while to unveil the national security team after the Thanksgiving holiday, but the timing took on additional urgency after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai. The attacks, which killed at least 180, including six Americans, offered a stark reminder that for all of Mr. Obama's focus on fixing the economy, national security can capture a president's attention at any moment.
 Reports of the selections drew praise from a retiring Republican elder. ''The triumvirate of Gates, Clinton and Jones to lead Obama's national security team instills great confidence at home and abroad,'' said Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, a former chairman of the Armed Services Committee, ''and further strengthens the growing respect for the president-elect's courage and ability to exercise sound judgment in selecting the best and the brightest to implement our nation's security policies.''.
 While the choices have generated praise across the aisle, some critics have pointed out that the team represents experience rather than the change Mr. Obama promised on the campaign trail. All of his top choices served in either the Clinton or Bush administration.
 At a news conference last week, Mr. Obama said he was trying to ''combine experience with fresh thinking'' an added that ''the vision for change comes'' from him.

 PANEL FEARS TERRORISTS' USE 
 Of Unconventional Weapons
 An independent, bipartisan commission said in a report that a terrorist will carry out an attack using nuclear, biological or other unconventional weapons in the next five years unless the United States and its allies act urgently to prevent that. It also said that Pakistan would have to become a top security priority of the incoming Obama administration. ''America's margin of safety is shrinking, not growing,'' the panel said. PAGE A11
 CHINA IS WORRIED ABOUT DOWNTURN
 President Hu Jintao warned at a government meeting that the global financial crisis could undermine China's economy and that the country could lose its competitive edge as trade growth slows. In the months since the country held the Beijing Olympics, stock and real estate prices have fallen sharply, construction has slowed drastically, and export growth has declined for several quarters. PAGE A14 
 CONTRACTORS TO LOSE PROTECTIONS
 The ratification last week of a new security pact in Iraq also meant that the thousands of American contractors working in Iraq will no longer be granted immunity from Iraqi law. The loss of those legal protections has left officials in the defense contract industry trying to figure out how they will continue to do business there. PAGE A14
 RUSSIA LOOMS OVER NATO DEBATE
 Just what should NATO's relationship be with Georgia and Ukraine? That issue will be the focus of debate between the United States and Germany as NATO foreign ministers gather this week in Brussels. While the debate is ostensibly over the mechanisms through which Georgia and Ukraine will, at some point, become members of the alliance, the real debate is over relations with Russia. PAGE A8
 U.N. PICK FAVORS INTERVENTION
 President-elect Barack Obama has selected Susan E. Rice to be ambassador to the United Nations, according to sources close to the transition. Ms. Rice, one of Mr. Obama's closest advisers, is a prominent and forceful advocate of stronger action, including military force if necessary, to stop mass killings like those in the Darfur region of Sudan in recent years. Mr. Obama plans to restore the ambassador's post to cabinet rank, as it was under President Bill Clinton. PAGE A12
 AFGHAN BOMBER KILLS TWO
 A suicide bomber in Kabul waded into traffic before detonating his explosives, killing two people and wounding three others. Authorities said that the target appeared to be a sport utility vehicle belonging to the German Embassy, but the vehicle's sole occupant, an Afghan employee of the embassy, escaped unharmed. PAGE A14

 NATIONAL
 AGENCY OUTLINES ITS PLAN
 To Raise Guard on Food Hazards
 The Food and Drug Administration will release a report on Monday that summarizes what officials say is a continuing and ''hugely ambitious'' campaign to root out food safety hazards. Included are the hiring of at least 130 new employees to conduct inspections and collect samples, the use of irradiation for iceberg lettuce and spinach, and offices overseas to enhance the agency's ability to monitor food exported to the United States. PAGE A17
 LEARNING BY DOING
 Over sandwiches and pizza, a group of high school students at the Meadows School in Las Vegas debated the pros and cons of combating poverty in five desperate nations. They scrolled through Web sites and analyzed statistics and other considerations. And this was no mere academic exercise. The students have $25,000, which they raised, to spend. PAGE A17
 PLEA BARGAIN FOR BOY IS CONSIDERED
 A lawyer for an 8-year-old Arizona boy accused in the shooting deaths of his father and another man says he will not decide whether to accept a plea bargain until the prosecution produces forensic evidence and psychological evaluations are completed to determine if the boy is competent to stand trial. The lawyer declined to provide details of the plea bargain offer. PAGE A19
 SHUTTLE COMPLETES MISSION
 Diverted from a planned Florida landing by low clouds and high crosswinds, the Space Shuttle Endeavour glided to a smooth landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California, closing out a 16-day space station assembly mission. The flight director, Bryan Lunney, had briefly held open the option of keeping the astronauts in orbit an extra day and trying for Florida again on Monday. But forecasters concluded that there was little chance the weather would improve. PAGE A19
 TROUT HERE, COME AND GET THEM
 A group of landowners, including the rock singer Huey Lewis and Charles R. Schwab of brokerage firm fame, are none too happy about the prospect of losing their exclusive use of a scenic trout-rich stream in the Bitterroot Valley of Montana. But the Montana Supreme Court ruled recently that the 16-mile-long stream is open to the public. PAGE A20

 TRYING TO PUT A FIGURE
 On Stimulus Plan Needs
 Now that the government has spent nearly $1.4 trillion to stabilize the financial system, economists and policy makers -- and the president-elect -- are trying to figure out how much must be invested in a stimulus package to stop the recession and what that money should be spent on. Just to offset the rate of contraction and get to zero growth would require at least $400 billion, many economists calculate. And President-elect Barack Obama speaks of wanting a fairly robust expansion. PAGE B1
 AUTOWORKERS FEAR GIVEBACKS
 In his testimony before Congress last month, Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Autoworkers Union, insisted the U.A.W. would not make further concessions on top of those granted the carmakers in recent years. ''The U.A.W. can't be the low-hanging fruit,'' he said. But any collective plans from Detroit, if they are to win over Congress, may require additional cost-saving concessions from the union. PAGE B1
 CNN LOOKS TO NEWSPAPER SERVICE
 CNN is looking to expand beyond its broadcasting business by catering to financially strained newspapers looking for an alternative to The Associated Press. A trial version has been in some newspapers for about a month; this week editors from about 30 papers will visit Atlanta to hear CNN's plans to broaden the service. PAGE B3
 BANKING ON THE LURE OF TOUCH
 Cellphone makers and carriers hoping to duplicate the blockbuster success of the iPhone are pushing their own phones with touch-sensitive screens. But they do not come cheap, and with consumers keeping a close watch on their bank balances, analysts and industry experts say most touch-screen phones will have trouble getting onto the list of this season's must-have gadgets. PAGE B1
 WASN'T HE AGAINST THAT?
 The special Lincoln issue of American Heritage magazine is crammed with flattering articles and essays -- and an ad for a Pride of the South commemorative Civil War ring, complete with a Confederate flag; and the luxury-themed winter issue of Time Style & Design, with its $36,000 cellphone and $1,000 skin cream, arrives just in time for a tanking economy. Media Talk. PAGE B4
 SEASONS GREETINGS ON SALE
 Is a clothing store ad composed of the name of the shop, its address and telephone number and the words ''on sale'' repeated 128 times a fitting sign of the times? Should Bette Midler consider releasing a followup to her 1976 album, ''Songs for the New Depression''? and other questions about advertising, marketing, media and popular culture. PAGE B4

 LAWYER ASSAILS TACTICS
 Of State Police Investigation
 A lawyer for Daniel Wiese, the retired State Police colonel at the center of an eight-month investigation by the attorney general into the State Police, has threatened that he and Mr. Wiese client will stop cooperating with the inquiry to protest what he described as overbearing and abusive prosecutorial tactics in the case. In a letter, the lawyer, Kevin J. Kitson, said that the inquiry had ''become aimless harassment of Mr. Wiese and others, driven not by facts, but by the need to find some justification for the investigation and, I suggest, political motives.'' PAGE A22
 SCALING NEW HEIGHTS
 Growing up in East Elmhurst, Queens, Eric Holder lived in two worlds: neighborhood kid and basketball addict; and overachiever who buried himself in books and newspapers. ''I didn't have any idea what I would be when I grew up,'' he says. At 57, what he stands to be now is the first black attorney general of the United States. PAGE A23

 GIANTS CAN DO WITHOUT
 Their Talented Knucklehead
 He has great hands on the football field, but apparently is all thumbs when it comes to the loaded gun in his pocket. And while the Giants are good enough that they can afford to be magnanimous about the knucklehead who apparently shot himself in the thigh in a nightclub on Friday night, George Vecsey writes in Sports of the Times, that does not mean that the generosity of spirit should extend to the roster. PAGE D3 
 IGNORING A DISTRACTION
 On a damp and dreary afternoon, the Giants powered past the rival Redskins, 23-7, their latest show of defiance against a difficult schedule and Plaxico Burress's most recent off-field drama. The Giants, now 11-1 for the first time in franchise history, displayed their potent combination of punch and adaptability. The Redskins (7-5) dared their rivals to move the ball through the drizzly air, and the Giants warmed to the task. Quarterback Eli Manning had his first 300-yard passing day of the season, helping the Giants to score on their first three possessions. PAGE D1
 DENVER ENDS JETS' STREAK
 The Jets' five-game winning streak came to end against Denver at Giants Stadium by a 34-17 score. The Jets fell to 8-4 with the loss, but remained a game ahead of New England and now Miami in the American Football Conference East. After beating the Patriots and the Titans in back-to-back road games, the Jets fell to another A.F.C. West foe. They are 1-3 against the division widely considered the worst in football this season.

 IT'S AN HONOR JUST TO BE INVITED, AS FILM CLUB TIGHTENS ITS RANKS
 The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, 5,810 active members who hand out the Oscars, is becoming more artsy, international and indie-minded just as much of the Hollywood establishment hoped to make it more commercial. The academy changed its admissions policy in 2004 in an attempt to curtail its growth. In practice, this has meant many who might have waltzed in under the old policy now find it harder to become voting members. PAGE C1 
 CRUMBLING SOUTH BRONX AS MUSE
 Ray Mortenson's rarely exhibited black-and-white photographs of the most wasted of the wastelands that made up parts of the South Bronx in the early 1980s are now at the Museum of the City of New York, in a show called ''Broken Glass.'' The pictures have the added resonance of appearing as the nation confronts its most serious economic crisis in decades, making them feel like a kind of augury. PAGE C1 
 A MEDIA MOGUL WITH MOXIE
 ''The Man Who Owns the News'' by Michael Wolff, the longtime media columnist, ventures into what the book's subtitle calls the ''secret world'' of Rupert Murdoch, one of the planet's most legendary press barons. How far into that world did Mr. Wolff get? Well, if he envisioned this book as anything outside its subject's control, Janet Maslin writes, he underestimated Mr. Murdoch's already larger-than-life gifts as a control freak. Books of the Times. PAGE C1 
 MOVIEGOERS TURN TO CHRISTMAS
 ''Four Christmases,'' a holiday comedy starring Vince Vaughn and Reese Witherspoon, above, led the box office with about $31.7 million in ticket sales for Warners Brothers and its New Line unit on a solid post-Thanksgiving weekend. The period romance ''Australia,'' which stars Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman, appeared to place fifth for the weekend with just $14.8 million in domestic sales for 20th Century Fox. The film, which reportedly cost about $130 million, has taken in $20 million since it opened on Wednesday. PAGE C3 
 HOMAGE TO LENNON KEEPS GOING
 If your annual charity fund-raiser looks as if it might actually lose money, do you stage it anyway? Joe Raiola, the principal organizer of an event called the Lennon Tribute, has the appreciation for the incongruous required to answer yes to that question: by day he's a senior editor at Mad magazine. And so he is pressing ahead with this year's event, the 28th installment of an annual show remembering John Lennon. Fund-raising wasn't the original point of this shoestring variety show anyway, and it's only part of the point now. PAGE C2 
 Editorial
 THE HORROR IN MUMBAI
 The appalling carnage in India, whoever was behind it, leaves many questions demanding answers. And it creates the prospect of dangerous new furies between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan. India must step carefully. PAGE A28
 A Cool Head on Immigration
 The word is that Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona is President-elect Barack Obama's choice for homeland security secretary, which would make her the country's top official handling immigration enforcement and border control. Lucky country. Poor Arizona. PAGE A28
 A BREATHTAKING HOPE FOR AIDS
 It sounds too good to be true, and it may prove to be so in the real world. But researchers at the World Health Organization have come up with a suggestion to drastically reduce the transmission of AIDS and virtually halt the widening epidemic in Africa within a decade. PAGE A28
 Op-Ed
 WILLIAM KRISTOL
 If terror groups are to be defeated, it is national governments that will have to do so. That means that in nations like India -- and the United States -- governments will have to call on the patriotism of citizens. PAGE A2
 PAUL KRUGMAN
 There's intense debate about how aggressive the United States government should be in trying to turn the economy around. Some economists worry about the burden that large budget deficits will place on future generations. But strong fiscal expansion would actually enhance the economy's long-run prospects. PAGE A29
 HOW DID THAT WIND UP IN THE MET?
 Come the new year, the Metropolitan Museum of Art will have its first new director in decades and with Thomas Campbell's arrival, a fresh start, writes Sharon Waxman, author of ''Loot: The Battle Over the Stolen Treasures of the Ancient World.'' It is an opportunity for the Met to tell the fuller -- and often controversial -- stories behind how certain artifacts found their way into the collection. PAGE A29

HEADLINE: The Dislocated Americans

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
More and more workers have relocated abroad in recent years, but despite the growing numbers, family issues remain a major factor in the failure of overseas postings.
 The initial excitement of an exotic new posting can turn to culture shock, loneliness, identity loss and depression, and it is often the employee's spouse and children -- without the familiar routine of work -- who are most affected. 
 ''I thought it would be an adventure, and it was,'' said Francesca Kelly, who moved 10 times in the first nine years as a Foreign Service spouse, living in places like Belgrade and the former Soviet Union during the cold war. But it ''was much more difficult than I ever imagined it would be.'' 
 Brenda H. Fender, director of global initiatives for Worldwide ERC, an association concerned with work force mobility, said ''if the family cannot adapt, the employee will likely not succeed.'' 
 And not succeeding can be expensive. 
 Scott T. Sullivan, senior vice president at GMAC Global Relocation Services, told the story of a man from Cleveland with an important role in building a large manufacturing plant in rural China. He left the work and returned home when his wife and child became desperately unhappy. This disrupted the project, a joint venture with a Chinese company, which then backed out -- a loss for the American company of hundreds of millions of dollars, Mr. Sullivan said, that could have been avoided with a better assessment before the man left home. 
 Cross-cultural training helps families know what to expect, Mr. Sullivan said, but only 23 percent of companies make it mandatory. 
 A GMAC Relocation Trends survey released in May found that despite a slowing economy, 68 percent of multinational corporations continued to relocate employees at record levels. Experts say it is too early to tell how the current crisis will affect global work force mobility. 
 Jeanne E. Branthover, head of the global financial services practice for Boyden Global Executive Search, a recruiting firm with offices in 40 countries, said that financial services recruiting in emerging markets remained constant. ''Candidates are much more willing to relocate compared to a year ago.'' 
 Yvonne McNulty, a Singapore-based consultant who studies mobility issues, said the biggest issue for spouses was loss of identity. ''What I found in my research is that almost all spouses face an identity crisis but only about 10 to 15 percent did something about it, by becoming authors, getting an M.B.A. or starting businesses,'' she said. Most ''felt they were victims, with no control.''
 Even when a company offers generous support, which may include help finding housing, language training and even funds for personal development for the spouse, that is often not enough. 
 In the early 1990s, an in-house study conducted by Royal Dutch Shell found that an increasing number of two-career families were turning down overseas assignments. In the past, ''a cadre of highly mobile employees would go anywhere at any time they were told,'' said Simon Armstrong, who until recently was manager of Global Outpost Services, a support network for Shell employees and their families that was created in response to the study. 
 Mr. Armstrong, who is an expatriate spouse, said the network typically starts advising spouses six months ahead of departure. ''We've been on the ground and done it. We know what to expect.''
 Ms. Kelly, the Foreign Service spouse, who now lives in Bethesda, Md., and another spouse founded The Sun (The Spouses' Underground Newsletter) as a way to create their own support community. Initially, it was an irreverent mix of poetry, opinions and the continuing tales of a fictional ''highly flawed, complete disaster of a diplomatic wife,'' she said.
 Soon contributions took on a more serious cast; readers wanted information about where they were planning to live. By 2000, The Sun became Tales From a Small Planet, a nonprofit Web site where members can read reports on some 350 cities written by expatriates. 
 Patricia Linderman -- living in Guayaquil, Ecuador -- edits Tales and is co-author of ''The Expert Expat: Your Guide to Successful Relocation Abroad'' (Nicholas Brealey, 2007). She said there had been an explosion of resources in recent years that support expatriates and many now also ''focus on the personal and emotional aspects of cross-cultural living,'' she said. 
 Due to lack of experience or not investing in professional relocation services, ''don't necessarily expect the company or organization that sent you abroad to take care of your needs,'' Ms. Linderman said. 
 That was Meg Sondey's experience when she moved to Torreon, Mexico, four years ago when her husband was sent by the Lincoln Electric Company to run a factory there. The company, based in Cleveland, had only one other person in Torreon at the time. She handled most of the details -- housing, immigration issues, getting a driver's license -- on her own. It was ''like jumping into a cold lake,'' she said. ''It's uncomfortable, frightening, everything is on hyper alert because it is so different.''
 She added: ''There are times you are fed up and depressed. Sometimes you are in shock and the only person who understands is another expat.''

HEADLINE: Aide to Former Detroit Mayor Pleads Guilty in Sex Scandal

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The top aide to Detroit's disgraced former mayor, Kwame M. Kilpatrick, pleaded guilty Monday to obstruction of justice and agreed to serve four months in jail for her part in the text-message sex scandal that led to Mr. Kilpatrick's downfall. 
 The settlement that the aide, Christine Beatty, reached with prosecutors is nearly identical to the terms of the deal struck by Mr. Kilpatrick in September.
 Both must serve five years' probation and pay restitution to the city, although Ms. Beatty, who has been unemployed since quitting as the mayor's chief of staff in January, will owe a 10th of the $1 million that Mr. Kilpatrick agreed to pay. Ms. Beatty will be barred from continuing her pursuit of a law degree while on probation; Mr. Kilpatrick had to relinquish his law license.
 After a judge read the terms of the deal, Ms. Beatty wiped tears from her eyes before admitting, ''I lied under oath.''
 She and Mr. Kilpatrick had given testimony in court and in a deposition denying that they had a sexual relationship or that they fired two police officers who they feared might expose their affair. 
 But sexually explicit text messages between them, sent on city-issued pagers, contradicted that testimony, and they arranged a secret deal with the officers as part of an $8.4 million settlement from the city to keep the messages hidden.
 The messages became public, and prosecutors charged Ms. Beatty and Mr. Kilpatrick with 15 felonies, including obstruction of justice and perjury.
 Ms. Beatty, 38, a divorced mother of two who attended high school with Mr. Kilpatrick, will be sentenced Jan. 5 and was ordered to remain in Detroit until then. 
 Mr. Kilpatrick, who is 38 and married, reported to jail in October, six weeks after relinquishing his office. The former City Council president, Kenneth V. Cockrel Jr., will serve as interim mayor until a special election in May.
 ''Come Jan. 5, when she is sentenced, we can truly move on from this chapter in Detroit's history,'' the Wayne County prosecutor, Kym L. Worthy, said. 
 Ms. Worthy said her office was ''continuing to investigate other matters'' that could involve Mr. Kilpatrick or Ms. Beatty, but she did not elaborate.
 Ms. Beatty's case took longer to settle than Mr. Kilpatrick's mainly because of differences over the length of her sentence. She said Monday that she had decided to settle rather than ''to take a chance on not being there for my daughters'' if she had been convicted and imprisoned.
 Ms. Worthy said investigators had a ''very, very strong case'' against Ms. Beatty and Mr. Kilpatrick, including thousands of pages of incriminating text messages. ''There's so many that you all knew nothing about and so much evidence that no one has ever seen,'' she said.
 Unlike Mr. Kilpatrick, who appeared defiant in court and in a televised farewell speech, Ms. Worthy said, ''I think this defendant was genuinely remorseful.''

PERSON: Bill Drake 

HEADLINE: Bill Drake, 71, Dies; Created a Winning Radio Style

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Bill Drake, who transformed radio programming with a syndicated format that delivered more music, fewer commercials and high-energy ''Boss Jocks'' -- D.J.'s big on personality but economical with words -- died Saturday in Los Angeles. He was 71. 
 The cause was lung cancer, said Carole Scott, his companion.
 In the 1960s, Mr. Drake, an up-and-coming disc jockey and programmer from south Georgia, revolutionized radio when he and his partner, Lester Eugene Chenault (pronounced Sha-NAULT), decided that radio stations could make a lot more money and reach more listeners if they cut back on D.J. chatter, accelerated the pace of their programs and gave audiences more of what they presumably tuned in to hear: hit songs. 
 He and Mr. Chenault introduced a formula, eventually sold as a syndicated package with prerecorded music, that would revamp -- and homogenize -- radio stations across the United States. 
 Under the slogan ''Much More Music,'' KHJ in Los Angeles, an early client, began playing 14 records each hour, far more than the competition. Commercials were limited to 13 minutes and 40 seconds each hour, a third less than the competition had. Station-identification jingles (usually performed a cappella by the Johnny Mann Singers) were cut to one and a half seconds. A new breed of disc jockeys, billed as Boss Jocks, were drilled to keep their patter to a minimum, and to standardize it. 
 The results were startling. KGB in San Diego went from last to first in its market in 90 days. KHJ, with Boss Jocks like the Real Don Steele and Robert W. Morgan at the microphone, leapt from 12th place to first in 1965. In New York, critics howled when Mr. Drake and Mr. Chenault forced out the legendary D.J. Murray the K from WOR-FM, but the station doubled its audience.
 In its heyday in the early 1970s, the two men's consulting firm, Drake-Chenault Enterprises, served about 350 client stations with makeover advice and totally automated packages in six different formats.
 ''He took Top 40 radio and turned it into a machine,'' said Marc Fisher, the author of ''Something in the Air: Radio, Rock and the Revolution That Shaped a Generation'' (Random House, 2007). 
 ''He pared it down to the essentials and made it a vehicle for selling advertising rather than an entertainment form, something you tuned in to for music, the news, the time and the weather, all in a slickly designed format,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''It is common to think of radio that way now, but in the 1960s it was revolutionary.'' 
 The standardized formats influenced other AM and eventually FM stations nationwide to lose not just their individualized D.J. stars but also to some degree their independent voices. The comedian George Carlin joked about Boss Radio as early as 1972 on the album ''FM & AM'': 
 ''Hi gang. Scott Lame here. The Boss jock with the Boss sound from the Boss list of the Boss 30 that my Boss told me to play.'' 
 The Boss D.J.'s drew their own followings, however, and younger fans who grew up with them attend reunions to meet their favorites. 
 Philip Taylor Yarbrough grew up in Donalsonville, Ga., and began working at a local radio station as a teenager. While attending South Georgia Teachers College in Statesboro, he worked the 9 p.m.-to-midnight shift at WWNS, where his sign-off theme was Hugo Winterhalter's version of ''Canadian Sunset.'' 
 ''If you were a freshman girl and were off campus somewhere and heard that, you knew you were in deep trouble unless you could get back to the college before the song was over,'' said Ramona Palmer, whom he married in 1959 after taking a job at WAKE radio in Atlanta and changing his name to rhyme with the station's call letters. The couple divorced in 1966. Two later marriages also ended in divorce. He is survived by a daughter, Kristie Philbin of Delray Beach, Fla.
 At WAKE, where he began as a D.J. and rose to become program director, Mr. Drake began tinkering with the programming so successfully that the station's parent company sent him to California to work some magic on its San Francisco station.
 In 1962 he was hired by Mr. Chenault, the owner of KYNO in Fresno, who also had innovative ideas about packaging radio. Together they created Drake-Chenault Enterprises, rescued KGB in San Diego, their first client, then struck gold with KHJ.
 ''We cleaned up AM radio,'' Mr. Drake told The Los Angeles Times in 1990. ''We put everything in its place. It was radio that was designed for the listener. Before us, disc jockeys would just ramble on incessantly.'' 
 No longer did D.J.'s introduce songs, or spin yarns about teenage romance, or project a quirky personality, in the style of Wolfman Jack. ''His insight was realizing that you could turn these D.J.'s into household names even if they didn't really do anything on the air,'' Mr. Fisher said. 
 Songs got the Drake-Chenault treatment, too. Regardless of the stature of the artist, two minutes was just about the limit, which meant that even Beatles hits were trimmed to fit. The Top 40 list was shrunk to the Top 30. Another Drake-Chenault innovation was to program the news at odd times, like 20 minutes after the hour, so that their stations would be playing music, and enticing listeners, when others were broadcasting the news. 
 By cutting down on commercials, the stations were able to sell advertising at higher rates. ''Everybody else was choking the goose laying the golden egg, jamming in as many commercials as they could,'' he told www.radioandrecords.com last year. ''When our slots were sold, that was it.''
 Mr. Drake gained a reputation as a ruthless, detail-minded operator. Special phone lines in his Bel Air home allowed him to monitor his client stations by punching in a code and listening. If he did not like what he heard, things could become unpleasant.
 ''When that phone rings, you know it's death time, man,'' a battle-scarred D.J. told Time magazine in 1968.
 Mr. Drake sold his interest in Drake-Chenault Enterprises in 1983, and the company dissolved in the mid-1980s. In recent years, Mr. Drake developed ''Top 40 Time Clock,'' a syndicated cavalcade of more than 1,800 hits aimed at the baby boom generation. 
 ''It has a great hook,'' Mr. Drake wrote in a Web site promotion. ''You can't wait to hear what comes up next. It's the History of Top 40 Radio without the narration.''
 In other words, no D.J. chatter. As Mr. Drake told www.radioandrecords.com, ''I always said if you're going to say nothing anyway, say it in as few words as possible.''

HEADLINE: Cheer Fades As Stocks Plunge 9%

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
December blew in with a mighty chill on Wall Street.
 In six and a half hours on Monday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined nearly 9 percent -- the type of collapse that, historically, has taken years to occur. But in 2008, a year that has now been officially declared to be in recession, the drop registered with a resigned sense that, yes, this awful year still has yet another month to go.
 The sell-off, which erased nearly all the gains enjoyed by the stock market in Thanksgiving week, came as investors flocked to the safety of government notes, driving their yields to near record lows as concern mounted that the economy could get much worse before it improves. 
 Investors have long assumed that the country was in recession, and analysts said that after last week's gains, including the biggest five-day rally in decades, a sell-off was to be expected. But perhaps not this fast -- and not this deep. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 679.95 points or 7.7 percent, all but wiping out a 783-point gain built up last week. The S.& P. 500 gave back 80 points of the 96-point gain from the same period. The Nasdaq composite index was also off 9 percent.
 ''I don't think it's a surprise to anyone that we unwound much of last week's gains,'' said Douglas M. Peta, an independent market strategist. ''But it was a surprise that the unwinding was all in a single session.''
 Anxiety is mounting that a quick recovery for the economy no longer seems probable. The nonpartisan National Bureau of Economic Research, charged with officially dating recessions, has declared that the economy had been languishing in one since December 2007. 
 ''To find out that we are 11 months into the recession with no end in sight, I think that concerns people,'' Mr. Peta said. ''It makes them say, gee, we're right back into the territory of the 1980, 1981 twin recessions'' -- and past the more modest dips of the early 2000s and 1990s.
 The Institute for Supply Management recorded the worst reading on the health of the manufacturing industry since 1982. ''However you look at the numbers, the message is the same: manufacturing is in free fall, with output collapsing,'' Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics wrote in a note to clients. ''We see no prospect for near-term improvement.'' 
 That view may be underscored on Friday, when the government is expected to report that employers shed more than 300,000 jobs in November, a fresh sign of the problems facing American workers and businesses.
 Worries about the economy were most pronounced in the debt market, where yields on 10- and 30-year Treasury securities fell near their record lows. 
 Investors rushed to buy government notes, considered the most reliable investment, pushing the price on the 10-year note up 1 22/32, to 108 26/32, causing the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, to fall to 2.73 percent, from 2.92 percent late Friday. Earlier, the yield fell as low as 2.65 percent, the lowest level since the Federal Reserve's records began in 1962. 
 The yield on the 30-year bond dropped to 3.24 percent after briefly hitting a record low of 3.18 percent.
 Some hedge fund and mutual fund managers, anticipating big redemption requests from clients, may also have seen last week's rally as a good signal to sell assets at a decent price. With the new year looming, many funds and banks are looking to shore up their balance sheets so they can put their best fiscal face forward to investors awaiting year-end reports, leading some analysts to fret that markets may become more volatile as December wears on. 
 ''There are stories of hedge funds putting up gates and putting halts on redemptions,'' said Todd Salamone, an analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''Fund managers are looking at last week's rally as a good opportunity to raise cash to meet future redemptions.''
 The major indexes fell by hundreds of points just after the opening bell, led by huge declines in shares of financial firms. Citigroup, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley shares all dropped more than 20 percent. Most other major Wall Street banks were also in double-digit percentage declines.
 Shares of retail companies also slumped on concern that retailers might see only modest gains as consumers remained prudent this holiday season. The daily decline of financial stocks in the S.& P. 500 was 17 percent -- the worst decline for any sector in at least two decades.
 ''Financials led the rally on the way up, and they're leading on the way down,'' said Anthony Conroy, head equity trader at BNY ConvergEx Group.
 Despite the sharp sell-off, it was also remarkable that on one of the worst single-day sessions in decades, there was little panic to be seen on Wall Street. 
 ''Investors have slowly become accustomed to it, after seeing it day after day for month after month,'' Mr. Salamone said. ''A year ago, a 9 percent move would have raised a lot more eyebrows than it does today.''
 Concern over a slowing economy, which may cut demand, pulled oil prices down $5.15 to settle at $49.28 barrel in New York trading.
 The declines on Wall Street came after stocks fell in Europe and most of Asia, regions that are also being stung by the economic downturn. Benchmark indexes in Paris and Frankfurt were down more than 5 percent, and London's FTSE-100 dipped 5.2 percent. The Nikkei 225 index fell 4.6 percent on Tuesday morning.
 Following are the results of Monday's Treasury auction of three- and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Forget Citigroup and Lehman, Puppet Show Needs a Bailout

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
There are many ways to measure California's tanking economy: an 8.2 percent unemployment rate; a multibillion-dollar state budget gap; threatened endowments of the city's museums, causing some cultural institutions to nearly default on mortgages; and the continued weakening of the Hollywood studio system. But the meltdown of the marionettes may say it all.
 Near a freeway overpass on a decidedly scrappy edge of downtown Los Angeles is a marionette puppet theater that has enchanted children over nearly five decades, several recessions, two riots, at least four failed urban renewal plans and an earthquake or two.
 The Bob Baker Marionette Theater's shows, employing an eclectic selection of Mr. Baker's 3,000 handmade puppets prancing about a shoebox-size theater perpetually decked out in gold garlands, are a staple of a Los Angeleno childhood. It is the cultural equivalent of the annual march by the nation's third graders to the neighborhood firehouse. 
 But the struggling California economy and some bad business decisions by Mr. Baker have left the Bob Baker marionettes in a deep financial ditch, and Mr. Baker, a rather unheralded Hollywood legend, with an uncertain future. ''We have all kinds of problems that have come up recently,'' Mr. Baker said. ''But we're not going to close. We're going to fight this out to the very bitter end.''
 Over the last few months Mr. Baker, 84, has fallen $30,000 behind on his mortgage and lost a rent-paying tenant, while his two major sources of revenue have dried up. First, the public schools have reduced financing for field trips. And second, some of his lower-income parents, he said, unemployed and swimming in debt, are unable to come up with the $15-per-ticket admission. 
 ''We've had quite a few people call who are losing their houses and have to cancel birthday parties,'' he said. 
 In addition, Mr. Baker said, a few years ago he refinanced the theater's mortgage to help pay for rising operating costs, and the mortgage payments have shot up. A business deal he made to improve his space went bad. He said he was negotiating with his lenders, and added ruefully, ''I am more of an artist than a businessman.'' 
 In a city where children's movies are often screened in a Hollywood theater with white-glove popcorn service and the organic certifications of birthday cakes are debated at length on Web sites aimed at parents, Mr. Baker's theater is a charming throwback.
 As they have for generations, children gather in a circle on the floor of the 200-person capacity auditorium as Mr. Baker's elaborately appointed marionettes scamper about to the sounds of old phonograph records, scratches and all. The theater is one of the few places in Los Angeles that routinely attracts racially and economically diverse groups of children. 
 A typical show requires about 15 workers, including 8 puppeteers, a lighting designer, a costume maker and ticket takers. There are usually two productions a year, one with a Christmas theme. The second show might be ''Something to Crow About,'' a barnyard spectacular; the Latin-flavored ''Fiesta''; or a revue like ''Bob Baker's Musical World,'' which might evolve over the season and employ a rotation of 100 or more puppets. Mr. Baker also performs puppet shows around Southern California for birthday parties and other events. The annual budget, Mr. Baker said, is about $360,000. 
 Victoria Hurley, 42, grew up in Los Angeles going to the shows, and now takes her children, who are 5 and 3. ''They still serve the exact kind of ice cream with the exact same wooden spoon I got 30 years ago,'' Mrs. Hurley said. ''The quality of the entertainment has certainly held up fantastically, but I think the building could use some sprucing. It is almost like they haven't even repainted. I personally think it is charming, but if I came from New York and brought my children I might feel otherwise.'' 
 At a recent performance of ''The Nutcracker,'' an eclectic mix of Mr. Baker's handmade puppets appeared, ranging from a Mouse King, resplendent in velvet, to what is perhaps best described as selections from the ''Soul Train'' collection, white leisure suits and gold trim included. 
 The marionettes are handled by Mr. Baker's students, who spend a good year under his tutelage before they are allowed to don black clothing and work before an audience. As they moved through the room they occasionally dropped a puppet into the lap of a delighted toddler. As usual, the whole affair ended with a cup of vanilla ice cream handed to each child. 
 The shows are not exactly linear. The ''Soul Train'' marionettes, for example, are wedged into ''The Nutcracker,'' and the story seems oddly lacking in the middle section. But the focus is really on the puppets, in their glorious velvet and gossamer. 
 ''There is a magic thing about a live puppet show,'' Mr. Baker said recently. ''I was watching the children just today and they were hugging the puppets, and then they always come up after me and ask me how they work. A lot of children who come here have never been to a live show and may never go to a live show again.''
 The number of people whose careers as puppeteers Mr. Baker started is ''amazing, at least a dozen professionally,'' said Greg Williams, 51, a professional puppeteer who helps Mr. Baker with his road shows. ''I started with him when I was 15, and was cleaning the party room. I went from there to doing the sets to the lights. One day a puppeteer wasn't available, and I got shoved on the floor,'' Mr. Williams said. 
 Mr. Baker ''gets a lot of the neighborhood kids, and some of these kids who look like they would have no future are here entertaining and enjoying it,'' Mr. Williams said. Mr. Baker still does many private birthday parties personally. ''You get those Beverly Hills parents and you need to keep those people happy,'' he added. 
 Mr. Baker, whose puppet passion began at an early age, has had an authentic Hollywood career -- something not immediately evident given his modest site downtown.
 He grew up in what is now Koreatown, in a house often full of actors and others from the ''theatrical world,'' Mr. Baker said, and graduated from Hollywood High School. When he was a little boy, his father took him to a holiday show at an area department store, which featured, as many store entertainments did in the early 20th century, puppets.
 When he turned 7 he bought two puppets and soon started working the birthday party circuit. He said his first party was for Mervyn LeRoy, a producer and director for both Warner Brothers and MGM, which set off a word-of-mouth campaign. Years later he would perform at Liza Minnelli's fourth birthday party. (And, keeping it in the family, a few years after that, he appeared in the 1954 Judy Garland film, ''A Star Is Born,'' conducting a marionette show.) 
 In the 1940s Mr. Baker worked as a puppet maker for George Pal, creator of the Puppetoons, whose movies and television credits include cult films like Edgar G. Ulmer's ''Bluebeard'' (1944), the original ''Star Trek'' series and ''Bewitched.'' 
 Mr. Baker started his production company in 1949 with his business partner, Alton Wood (who died in 2001). It has remained one of the more well-known training grounds for puppet makers who have gone on to work in fantasy films. 
 But it is the theater, opened in 1960 in a warehouselike building, for which Mr. Baker is best known around town. The elaborate facade meant to suggest ''Alice in Wonderland'' is long gone, as are the evening performances, which Mr. Baker said faded after the 1965 Watts riots made people afraid to venture downtown at night. Weekends and shows for school groups -- along with sales of puppets and movie work -- have sustained him, and he hopes the doors of his theater will stay open.
 ''My mother used to say, 'We can fall into a mud puddle and come up smelling like roses,' '' Mr. Baker said. ''We have gone through some pretty hard times, and I just have to see the light of day. We're just going to make it.''

HEADLINE: Major Poultry Producer Files for Bankruptcy Protection

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. de la MERCED

 BODY:
Facing a combination of high feed prices, a glut of product on the market and a swelling debt load, one of the nation's largest poultry producers filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday. 
 The company, Pilgrim's Pride, which started as a feedstore partnership in 1946, said that it had sought Chapter 11 protection in the Federal District Court in North Texas as it tries to negotiate with its creditors.
 The filing was not unexpected. Pilgrim's Pride had already sought to extend deadlines from its lenders, including CoBank and the Bank of Montreal.
 ''After careful consideration of all available alternatives, the company's board of directors determined that a Chapter 11 filing was a necessary and prudent step and the best way to obtain the financing necessary to maintain regular operations and allow for a successful restructuring,'' the chief executive, Clint Rivers, said in a statement.
 With the filing, Pilgrim's Pride joined a growing list of companies that have been buffeted by the storm of economic conditions. The chicken producer said, however, that its setbacks were temporary and that its outlook and that of its industry would improve in 2009.
 In a court filing, Pilgrim's Pride said it had arranged $450 million in debtor-in-possession financing through the Bank of Montreal, which will allow it to continue operating.
 Pilgrim's Pride said revenue in the 12 months that ended Sept. 27 was $8.5 billion, but that much of the money was needed to cover a sharp rise in the cost of feed like corn and soybeans. Pilgrim's Pride needs more than 285 million pounds of corn and more than 82 million pounds of soybean meal a week to feed its 238 million chickens.
 Efforts to hedge feed prices this summer backfired as corn prices began to slide in July.
 The company has also been hobbled by $2.72 billion in debt, much of it taken on when the company acquired a rival, Gold Kist, for $1.1 billion in late 2006. Pilgrim's Pride said it expected to report an $802 million loss for its fourth quarter, largely because of a write-down of Gold Kist.
 This year, the company hired Bain & Company and the investment bank Lazard to consider its options, and last month it appointed William Snyder of CRG Partners Group, an advisory firm, to oversee its restructuring.
 As of Nov. 25, Pilgrim's Pride had nearly 48,000 employees in North America, with 37 processing plants in the United States and Mexico.

HEADLINE: Protests at Bangkok Airports Threaten Thailand's Economy

BYLINE: By THOMAS FULLER; Bettina Wassener and Mark McDonald contributed reporting from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: BANGKOK 

 BODY:
Antigovernment protests that intensified last week with the takeover of the capital's two airports have plunged Thailand into its worst national crisis in at least a decade, and might severely damage the country's economy. 
 The blockades have hurt some of the country's crucial industries, especially tourism, at a time when the Thai economy was already showing signs of a slowdown because of the global financial crisis.
 The standoff also carries the potential for violence. A grenade fired Tuesday into the crowds at the city's domestic airport, Don Muang, killed one protester and injured 22, Reuters reported. 
 There is also concern about violence between demonstrators and the police. There are more than 2,000 security troops on standby around the main international airport, but the police say their priority is negotiation. A police helicopter flew over the main airport on Monday and dropped leaflets asking the thousands of protesters to ''rally in peace and without weapons.'' 
 Since Bangkok is also a regional hub for passengers and cargo, the repercussions are also spreading through Asia. Logistics companies and airlines are diverting business to competing hubs in Singapore; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; and Hong Kong. 
 Foreign governments, including that of the United States, have called on the protesters, who seek the resignation of Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat, to allow the airports to re-open. On Monday, after a concession by the protesters, airlines were flying dozens of empty planes out of the besieged international airport here, Thailand's main tourist gateway. Some of the planes were making stops elsewhere in the country, said Serirat Prasutanont, director of the Airports Authority of Thailand, to help funnel out some of the quarter-million or more foreign visitors still stranded. 
 The government has been using another airport, U-Tapao, at a Vietnam War-era military base two hours from Bangkok, to fly stranded passengers out. But that airport's facilities are overloaded, and in any case, extremely limited. 
 Thailand has two other international airports. One, in Chiang Mai, is an eight-hour drive north of Bangkok, and the other, on the resort island of Phuket, is nine hours to the south. 
 ''At the moment there are hardly any incoming passengers, very few,'' said Pornthip Hiranyakij, secretary general of the Tourism Council of Thailand. 
 On Monday, the rating agency Standard & Poor's lowered its economic outlook for Thailand because of the blockades. ''It has caused serious disruptions to economic activities in the kingdom and raises the possibility of widespread violence markedly,'' said Kim Eng Tan, a credit analyst. ''These developments will add to the negative pressures of a global slowdown on Thailand's economy.''
 Siriporn Manoharn, the governor of the Tourism Authority of Thailand, said the airport closings had created the worst crisis in the country's tourism industry since the nation was created five decades ago from the former Siam. ''Even the tsunami was over in just one day,'' she told the newspaper Thai Rath.

HEADLINE: After the Reign of Terror in Mumbai

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''India Faces a Reckoning as Terror Toll Eclipses 170'' (front page, Nov. 30):
 The ''maximum city'' is probably the most appropriate way I have heard my Mumbai described. It gave me a sense of confidence, a sense of resilience and a ''keep on moving'' attitude. 
 Moving back to the city after 20 years was anxiety-producing. The maximum city had further expanded. 
 It had changed in so many ways, some for the better, others for worse, but at its heart the attitude remained. The Taj Mahal Palace & Tower was one of those places that stayed the same, for the better. It embraced me back; it was its halls that helped me console my lost time with this city.
 Knowing Bombay, I am confident that it will recover, rise like a phoenix, and the Taj will be brought back to its glory. It will embrace and console me once again. Friends I lost, I will miss forever, but the memories will keep me moving on. Bobby Agarwal
 Mumbai, India, Nov. 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''New Risk in Danger Zone'' (news analysis, front page, Nov. 28):
 We are very angry. We saw blood and mayhem for three days. I heard the gunfire all night. The fear has now turned into rage. Anger is a good thing; it shakes us out of our indifference and inaction. We stand up and demand answers from our leaders. 
 The collective anger of a population is a powerful force. But as a young and outraged citizen of India, I am afraid of the direction our anger is taking. When all fingers point toward Pakistan, I am filled with a sense of dread. It is chilling to hear two nuclear powers use the language of war. 
 Pakistan is not a unified, coherent country; it is a nation at war with itself. Our self-righteous rage against Pakistan's inability to ''control'' its extremist groups is plain hypocrisy. Our own home-grown bunch of militant Hindu extremists posing as politicians very much have the freedom to walk the streets. Devika Narayan
 Mumbai, India, Nov. 30, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 The horrible tragedy in Mumbai has led to yet another moment for patriotic Indians to rally for a strong and resilient India. My hope is that this call is not based on the false prospect of needing to unite militarily around the horrors of terrorism. (The last eight years and the Bush administration have shown how cynically and incompletely that works.) 
 First and foremost, Indians must unite around a positive notion of a strong Indian civil society, one promised by its own freedom fighters, but now seemingly lost and fragmented. 
 We must hope that India will work as fervently against the sexism, casteism, religious intolerance and economic inequality that affect millions of its population as it appears to want to work against the terrorizing of the few who seek to undermine what could be such a potent and bright future for an amazing nation. Michael Katten

 The writer is a historian of India and the author of ''Colonial Lists/Indian Power.''
 To the Editor:
 Reading Suketu Mehta's article, ''What They Hate About Mumbai'' (Op-Ed, Nov. 29), made me sad about my beloved city. The terrorists struck at the heart of the city -- the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower and the Oberoi are much more than luxury hotels, they are icons of the vibrant life and the majesty of the city. 
 Like Mr. Mehta, I long to go back and embrace the spirit of Mumbai now.
 Madhura Pradhan
 Cherry Hill, N.J., Nov. 29, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Suketu Mehta's response to the Mumbai terrorist attacks may be informed by his personal experience, but it recapitulates almost exactly the Bush administration's fatuous response to 9/11 by suggesting that the antidote to terror is more shopping and greater consumption. 
 Extreme ideologies are a product of extreme global inequality. Choosing to dance, party, spend money and make even more money in the face of terrorism is a shallow and dangerous denial of the connection between localized prosperity and the poverty that breeds violence. Alex Coolman
 San Francisco, Nov. 30, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Suketu Mehta's heartfelt and compelling article about both Mumbai's tragedy and the rise of intolerance describes how it has changed (the rise of extreme intolerance) and why it is so hated by extremists and what he is going to do about it: he's flying from New York City back to his city to hoist a beer at Cafe Leopold. This helps and maybe works. 
 After the spate of bombings in Jerusalem, I flew in to join an old college buddy living in Jerusalem: we went to every site recently bombed, like Sbarro's on the corner of Jaffa and King George, and hoisted a pizza or an espresso to a future free from fear.
 The food and coffee were so-so; the spirits were high.

 Jerusalem, Nov. 29, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''The Special Sting of Personal Terrorism'' (Week in Review, Nov. 30):
 Anand Giridharadas, in what seems to be an otherwise insightful depiction of the latest approach to terrorism taken by the Mumbai attackers, indicates that ''the new men were not cowards.''
 Maybe it is me, but I think that men armed with machine guns and grenades who attack unarmed innocent civilians are not exactly the brave.

HEADLINE: Toyota Trims Management Pay

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Toyota Motor said on Tuesday it would cut management bonuses by 10 percent as the global economic slowdown deepens.
 The world's largest automaker is cutting bonuses for roughly 5,000 managers as the downturn keeps customers away from showrooms worldwide, a company spokesman said.
 Automakers are reeling from the worst downturn in decades as sales slump in the United States and Europe and even in developing markets such as China, which car makers had hoped would fuel near-term growth.
 Sales have fallen so much that car makers are cutting production, extending temporary plant closings and seeking government aid to ride out cuts in consumer spending.

HEADLINE: Now in the Private Sector, Bruno Is Selling Efficiency and Openness

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE

 BODY:
Joseph L. Bruno, New York's newest and perhaps most unlikely champion of government transparency, is searching for the right words.
 ''Sunlight, I guess?'' Mr. Bruno said, trying to recall the name of a state Web site that publishes lobbying and campaign finance records. ''Daylight, or something?''
 Second acts are never easy. But Mr. Bruno, who resigned from the State Senate in July after a career as one of New York's most powerful and memorable public figures, has chosen an especially challenging new role. 
 Over the nearly 14 years he served as Senate majority leader, Mr. Bruno became to some critics one of the symbols of Albany's secrecy, inefficiency and profligacy. Now, as the chief executive of CMA Consulting Services, an information technology and software firm based just outside Albany, Mr. Bruno is preaching the virtues of smaller, leaner, more accountable government. (The aforementioned Web site, by the way, is called Project Sunlight.) 
 Where Mr. Bruno once steered hundreds of millions of dollars in economic development money to his suburban Albany district, he now pitches municipal agencies on how to save money by switching to paperless payroll systems. 
 The man who went to court rather than reveal details of the Senate's pork-barrel spending now speaks proudly of his company's role in designing a program for the state comptroller that allows reporters or the public to examine any contract between a state agency and a vendor. 
 And Mr. Bruno, who once did most of his deal-making in secret as one of Albany's ''three men in a room'' -- along with Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and a succession of governors -- now spends much of his time hobnobbing at meetings and conferences in Texas, Arizona and other places. He hopes to double CMA's business over the next two years, in part by promoting the company's products to cash-strapped state officials nationwide.
 ''I feel like technology is a place that governments at all levels are going to have to look at for relief, to create efficiencies that they want and need, to create the service that people demand these days, to be responsive and to do it in a cost-effective way,'' Mr. Bruno, 79, said in an hourlong interview recently at a publicist's office in Manhattan. 
 ''You people can have some fun with that,'' Mr. Bruno added gamely, referring to the press. ''But I've always really been kind of on the leading edge of being open.''
 As Mr. Bruno pursues his new career, however, the vestiges of his old one still loom. In recent weeks, a grand jury heard additional testimony in a two-year-old federal investigation into outside business dealings Mr. Bruno had while serving as senator, according to two lawyers involved in the case.
 Since late October, Mr. Bruno has spent at least $24,999 from his campaign account to pay legal bills, according to the State Board of Elections. Federal prosecutors began the inquiry by looking into earmarks and economic development grants arranged by Mr. Bruno. Over the summer, it expanded to examine investments made by some unions with business before the Legislature in a private fund that employed Mr. Bruno. The lawyers involved in the case predict a conclusion by the end of the year, though no one seems sure what that would mean for Mr. Bruno -- least of all Mr. Bruno himself.
 ''I personally haven't heard from them,'' Mr. Bruno said, referring to federal investigators. ''My take is that they're looking to see if they think anything was done wrong. I've never been charged, never even been told that I was a target, by anybody. So I am doing my thing, making what contribution I can to the health and welfare of myself and the business community here.''
 The office of the United States attorney for the Northern District of New York, which is conducting the investigation, declined comment. Since resigning his Senate seat in July, Mr. Bruno has largely withdrawn from daily politics. He has begun to empty out his campaign account with checks to old Senate colleagues and local Republican organizations and has turned down most requests to appear at political events. Former colleagues said he calls occasionally to catch up, but has resisted the role of Republican elder statesman. For some time after leaving the Senate, Mr. Bruno said, he did not even speak with his successor as majority leader, Dean G. Skelos, Republican from Long Island. 
 ''I made up my mind, once I was out, that I wasn't going to try to be looking over anyone's shoulders, I wasn't going to be Monday morning quarterbacking,'' Mr. Bruno said. 
 His passions now, Mr. Bruno says, are his business, his family and his horses, which he tends to every day on his farm in Brunswick, N.Y. Mr. Bruno has largely escaped the grind of political life, friends say -- not to mention blame for his party's loss of the Senate in November and the dismal possibilities of life in the minority there.
 ''You can almost feel in his voice a load off his shoulders,'' said Jasper Nolan, the longtime Republican chairman in Saratoga County.
 But leaving the Capitol has not meant leaving the public sector behind. On the contrary: Although Mr. Bruno says he hopes most of the firm's expansion will be in the private sector, the vast majority of CMA's revenue comes from government contracts. Indeed, the firm expects that Mr. Bruno's vast experience in government will be a selling point to potential new clients. 
 ''It's helping me a great deal, having been there, on the inside, and now being on the outside,'' Mr. Bruno said. 
 With 410 employees and $42 million in annual revenues, CMA was a thriving and respected business even before Mr. Bruno was recruited. (The outgoing president, Kay McCabe Stafford, is the widow of Ronald Stafford, a former Republican senator who was a friend and colleague of Mr. Bruno's.) In Texas, for example, the firm designed a system for the state's child welfare agency that tracks case workers with global-positioning devices and allows them to file reports using handheld equipment. In Arizona and a dozen other states, CMA runs food-stamp programs, using automated software to track what mix of foods are being purchased by people receiving aid. 
 But close to half of the company's public-sector business is in New York, and includes state and city agencies. The firm has three dozen contracts with state agencies totaling about $30 million, according to state records. Five of those contracts, worth about $1.4 million, were awarded in October, though Mr. Bruno said those were largely negotiated before he joined the firm.
 Mr. Bruno has already registered as a lobbyist in New York. And though state law prohibits him from lobbying his former Senate colleagues for the next two years, he is free to lobby members of the executive branch. He remains close friends with Gov. David A. Paterson, a relationship that, combined with his stature as a former majority leader, could potentially pay enormous dividends for CMA. 
 The governor attended a barbecue at Mr. Bruno's home over the Fourth of July holiday and speaks roughly every other week with the former senator, according to both men. 
 ''David Paterson has been absolutely terrific to me,'' Mr. Bruno said.
 Well after leaving office, Mr. Bruno remained active in negotiations to provide Advanced Micro Devices, a computer-chip manufacturer, with more than $1 billion in state aid to build a factory in Saratoga County, a project Mr. Bruno regards as part of his legacy.
 ''Most of his ideas are about bringing business to New York and bringing jobs to New York,'' Mr. Paterson said. ''He's arranged for me to meet some people who hethinks can be helpful.''
 Mr. Paterson said that the former senator had not asked him for any favors. But the two ignored suggestions from ethics groups last summer that they seek special guidance from the state's public integrity commission on how to manage Mr. Bruno's interactions with executive branch officials, given the governor's closeness to Mr. Bruno. 
 ''Bruno wasn't some rank-and-file legislator,'' said Blair Horner, the legislative director for the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''The bottom-line corporate reason is, they're hoping that he will fatten the bottom line, that his personal relationships will help them to keep and expand the amount of government contract work.''
 Indeed, some do not buy Mr. Bruno's new enthusiasm for transparent government or his claims that it is consistent with policies he advocated as senator. 
 Mr. Bruno, for example, was the first Senate leader to require the release of every internal expenditure made by the Senate.
 But those reports are published only every six months, in a book format that makes it extremely difficult to examine the spending in any systematic way. (Asked about it, Mr. Bruno joked, ''You noticed that, huh?'') 
 Similarly, as majority leader, Mr. Bruno signed off on state budgets laden with what fiscal watchdogs call gimmicks, including the extensive use of private contractors that created the appearance of a shrinking state work force without the reality of shrinking spending.
 Mr. Bruno acknowledged that some skepticism about his reinvention was probably inevitable, but added: ''I hope when we get together in a year, I will be able to say I was responsible for a lot of good things.''

HEADLINE: Retailers Get a Brief Lift on Black Friday as Shoppers Look for Blockbuster Sales

New figures released Monday confirmed that consumers who had been sitting on their wallets for months pulled them out for Black Friday, giving the nation's retailers a much-needed spike in sales. 
 But analysts warned that a day or so of power shopping might prove inadequate to rescue troubled store chains. 
 Combined sales for Friday and Saturday were up nearly 2 percent from the period a year ago, according to ShopperTrak, a research firm that reported figures on Monday. SpendingPulse, a report by MasterCard Advisors, said specialty apparel sales were up 1.6 percent compared with last year, luxury goods rose 2.4 percent and Internet commerce climbed 11.8 percent. 
 Electronics and appliances fell 14.3 percent, but that is an improvement over the last couple of weeks, when sales in that category were down more than 20 percent. 
 ''The rebound we saw on Black Friday was impressive in all areas,'' said Michael McNamara, vice president of SpendingPulse. Cool weather, pent-up demand and the juicy deals known as doorbusters helped drive sales. 
 But Mr. McNamara cautioned that Black Friday -- named for the day when, historically, retailers moved into the black, or became profitable -- did not supply anywhere near the majority of November sales for stores. Those sales were remarkably weak in the weeks before Black Friday.
 Many reports and surveys regarding retail sales on Black Friday, containing conflicting information from analysts and industry groups with varying motives, are expected to trickle out this week.
 In line with what many longtime analysts reported, ShopperTrak said on Monday that foot traffic at all kinds of stores, including stand-alone stores and those in malls, plummeted 18 percent compared with last year. 
 Industry professionals said consumers who did shop were especially deliberate this year. In malls, instead of wandering into a few stores like Gap, Forever 21, Victoria's Secret and Circuit City, they simply made a beeline to the one or two stores where they planned to spend their dollars, said Bill Martin, co-founder of ShopperTrak.
 Reyne Rice, of the Toy Industry Association, said shoppers ''seemed particularly organized,'' and added that many were carrying store circulars and other lists. Indeed, in the wee hours of Friday, consumers pulled folded pieces of paper from their pockets before surging into stores. 
 While Black Friday sales were robust, they slowed Saturday as limited-time promotions ended and shoppers suffered from what Mr. Martin of ShopperTrak called ''spending hangover.'' Sales dropped 0.8 percent on Saturday, to $6 billion, compared with the same Saturday last year. In 2007, Black Saturday sales had jumped 5.4 percent, to $6.1 billion, compared with 2006.
 Matthew Katz, a managing director in the retail practice of Alix Partners, an advisory and restructuring firm, was wandering New Jersey malls and specialty stores over the weekend and summed up the crowds thusly: ''I was able to park in front-row spots.'' 
 The slowdown on Saturday was not surprising to retailers, who were also expecting fewer sales this week. 
 ''The traffic was still definitely a Friday phenomenon,'' said James Fielding, president of Disney Stores Worldwide. Late Friday afternoon into Saturday, he said, ''we definitely saw traffic trail off.'' 
 A more definitive picture of what happened on Black Friday weekend, and whether it helped retailers, will emerge Thursday, when stores report their November sales. ShopperTrak and SpendingPulse will have more details about the weekend on Wednesday when they report their complete Black Friday findings. 
 Retailers expect their final blockbuster weekend of the year to be the one before Christmas, when procrastinators -- and those who figured the deals would be sweeter in the run-up to the new year -- come out in droves. 
 Still, stores are concerned about some surveys, including one from the National Retail Federation, that say consumers are completing their holiday shopping earlier, most likely because shopping lists are shorter this year. That suggests some retailers' profits will erode because they will have to scramble to move Christmas merchandise. 
 Mr. Fielding said retailers were wishing they had crystal balls to determine how many consumers completed their holiday shopping last weekend and how many were just beginning. 
 ''We're all kind of scratching our heads,'' he said. ''In this economy, all bets are off.''

HEADLINE: Small Players Vie for 'Green Car' Loans

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Detroit's automakers are focused this week on convincing Congress to provide them $25 billion in federal aid. 
 But there is another $25 billion auto industry loan program, set up by the Department of Energy to quicken the development of fuel-efficient cars.
 Because it is open to any company with a promise and a plan to make more fuel-efficient cars, it has set off something of a gold rush, as a number of companies besides the Big Three, including Silicon Valley firms and old-line Detroit auto suppliers, angle for a piece of the program. 
 Many of the companies flocked to Washington for a meeting Monday sponsored by the Energy Department to review the rules governing the direct loans, which the government is expected to start making in coming weeks. 
 ''The government is saying, 'Here, come and get it,' and we will,'' said Curt Brainard, a spokesman for EcoMotors International, a Troy, Mich., company that is developing a two-stroke diesel engine that it says will allow compact cars to get 100 miles to the gallon. ''It will give us a tremendous benefit to have the government behind us and as we ramp up with investors.'' 
 In addition, Tesla Motors, a privately held company in San Carlos, Calif., has applied for $400 million in two loans. One would be used to develop an advanced battery and power train for the company's electric car -- currently Tesla makes an electric roadster with a $109,000 price tag. The other loan would be to develop a lower-priced midsize sedan, the ''Model S,'' using the same technology. 
 Another application has come from XP Vehicles, based in San Francisco, which is seeking $40 million to develop two electric cars, a two-seat runabout and a four-seat mini utility vehicle. 
 Scott Redmond, chairman of XP, said the government loans were an important source of financing, given the economy. 
 ''Venture capital money is frozen and that has put us in dire straits,'' said Mr. Redmond, who added that it cost ''hundreds of millions'' to develop a new car. ''We have a glut of customers, we just don't have enough credit. Financing is dead. We are facing the same problems as the Detroit companies. Everyone is really counting on this money.'' Lachlan W. Seward, director of the Advance Technology Vehicles Manufacturing Loan Program, said that five applications had been received to date, but declined to disclose details. 
 The three Detroit automakers have, so far, applied for at least $22 billion of the program's money, according to Michael Carr, counsel to the Senate Energy Committee, which initiated the legislation. Mr. Carr, who had been briefed on the loan program's status, said he was concerned that smaller companies might be left to fight over an disproportionately small share. The deadline for the first group of loan applications is Dec. 31. 
 Large auto suppliers also attended the briefing Monday, including representatives of Tenneco, Delphi, Visteon and Goodyear. Many asked questions about environmental impact studies, and requirements that companies meet criteria regarding their financial strength to receive a loan. 
 The Energy Department rules favor domestic automakers and suppliers. Manufacturing facilities eligible for the loans must be in the United States, along with all engineering and retooling. Preference is also given for modernization of manufacturing plants that are more than 20 years old, and most of the foreign automakers' plants in the United States are more recent than that. 
 The program is aimed at supporting the development of cars at least 25 percent more fuel-efficient than those made in 2005. 
 General Motors has said the money it is applying for -- it would not give an exact amount -- would be directed toward the development of the Chevrolet Volt, an electric car that is expected to need $2 billion for development costs. Ford Motor, which has said it will seek $7 billion in funds, is looking to convert three large plants that make large trucks and S.U.V.'s into making smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. 
 Some have raised concerns about the program, including raising the possibility that the Detroit automakers will try to use the funds to cover everyday expenses. 
 ''This program would be a failure if the Big Three used it as a way to fund business as usual and deprive money that could be used for innovative technologies,'' said Mr. Carr. 
 William J. Kohler, head of the automotive practice at the Detroit law firm Butzel Long, said the program should broadened to finance projects still on the drawing board. 
 ''The program is not oriented at funding for fundamental research, but to facilities and engineering for existing components,'' said Mr. Kohler. 
 Craig Fitzgerald, an auto industry consultant at Plante & Moran in suburban Detroit, also noted that fuel-efficient gains were often made in small increments, not in the major breakthroughs that the government was seeking to support. 
 ''They need to give weight to medium-range achievements as well as to breakthroughs,'' said Mr. Fitzgerald.

 A GROWING TEMPEST IN BRITAIN AFTER PARLIAMENT MEMBER'S ARREST
 Damian Green -- a 52-year-old member of Britain's Parliament and the Conservative Party's chief immigration spokesman -- has been front-page news since Scotland Yard's counterterrorism squad arrested him last Thursday, held him for nine hours and raided his home and offices. His offense seems to have centered on his relationship with a civil servant in the Home Office, Britain's interior ministry, who is said to have passed on documents from the office of the Home Secretary pertaining to immigration. PAGE A8 
 A RAMPAGE IN NIGERIA
 At least 400 people were killed on Friday in Jos, Nigeria after angry Christian and Muslim mobs protested what they said were rigged local elections. In the short-lived but brutal rampage, groups of young men killed residents and burned homes, churches, mosques and schools. The house of a Muslim mother of nine was burned. Across the street, were the burned remains of a church and Christian clinic. As an uneasy calm returned on Monday, bodies were still being discovered. PAGE A12 
 BLOCKADES HURTING THAI ECONOMY
 Antigovernment protests that intensified last week with the takeover of Bangkok's two airports have not only plunged Thailand into its worst national crisis in at least a decade, but might severely damage the country's economy as well. The blockades have stalled some crucial industries, especially tourism, at a time when the Thai economy was already showing signs of a slowdown because of the global financial crisis. PAGE A9 
 FILLING PAULSON'S SHOES
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. will travel to China on Wednesday to attend his fifth and last round of semiannual economic talks. After that, he will lay down the reins of American financial policies toward Beijing when he leaves office next month. That raises some questions: Who will pick up those reins in the Obama administration, and will the Treasury Department continue to be the lead agency in managing relations with China? PAGE A15 
 BOMBINGS KILL AT LEAST 32 IN IRAQ
 Suicide bombings in Baghdad and Mosul created carnage that recalled the levels of violence before the American troop buildup last year. At least 15 people were killed in two explosions at a police training academy in Baghdad. In Mosul, a suicide car bomber killed at least 17 people, mainly civilians, in an attack against a joint American-Iraqi convoy. The wave of violence follows the Iraqi Parliament's approval last week of a security agreement with the United States. PAGE A10

 HOUSE DEMOCRATS PUSH FOR AID
 To Help Struggling States
 Democrats in the House want to pass an economic recovery bill costing $400 billion to $500 billion next month as governors asked Congress for money to build roads and bridges, provide health care to low-income people and develop alternative sources of energy. Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she hoped Congress could deliver a bill to President-elect Barack Obama when he takes office. Senate aides said that Democrats would need to negotiate with Republicans to ensure swift approval of such a large package. PAGE A19
 DELAYS RAISE CANCER RISK
 A new study by the Weill Cornell Medical College found that one in five breast cancer patients ages 65 and older postponed radiation therapy or did not complete the full radiation regimen after breast-conserving surgery, and the lapses in care took a significant toll on their health. ''Patients need to understand the importance of going to all their treatments and going through them in a timely manner,'' the study's lead author said. ''The treatment is typically every day, Monday to Friday, for several weeks, and that's a huge burden, especially in this older population.'' PAGE A24
 MAYOR OF BIRMINGHAM ARRESTED
 Larry P. Langford, the mayor of Birmingham, Ala., was arrested by federal agents and charged in a 101-count indictment with taking more than $230,000 in cash, clothing and jewelry in exchange for giving county financial business to a favored firm when he led the Jefferson County Commission.

 CELEBRATING AN ISLAND'S HERITAGE
 The National Indigenous Festival of Jayuya, P.R., celebrates the culture of the Taino tribe, the native group that lived on the island before being wiped out by European conquest and assimilation. The tribe has come to occupy a special place in the island's cultural hierarchy: a geneticist in Puerto Rico found that at least 61 percent of Puerto Ricans possess remnants of Taino DNA -- and nearly everyone seems to believe they belong in that group. Above, Carelis Padilla, 8, talks with Melvin Guzman, 14, who holds a replica of a Taino drum at a cultural center in Jayuya. PAGE A18

 TAKING THEIR FAMOUS RECIPE ACROSS (OR UNDER) THE RIVER
 After the landlord raised their rent significantly, the proprietors of Ray's Real Pizza, which had long been a popular spot among celebrities and sports figures, decided to ply their trade elsewhere. They reopened their restaurant in the decidedly less busy hamlet of Hazlet, N.J. Sure, there are no worries about alarms and gates.

 LINING UP FOR A SLIVER
 Of the Other $25 Billion Package
 Many companies are angling for $25 billion in government money, but it's not for the much-debated bailout of the Big Three automakers. It's a program run by the Department of Energy that is supposed to speed up the development of fuel-efficient cars. And a host of companies -- Silicon Valley start-ups, old-line Detroit auto suppliers and even the Big Three themselves -- are trying to make their cases for a piece of the pie. PAGE B6
 CONSUMERS PRY OPEN WALLETS
 The nation's retailers got a much-needed boost as shoppers, who had been reluctant to part with their money for months, eagerly opened their wallets to take advantage of stunning discounts over Thanksgiving weekend. But analysts warned that a day or so of power shopping was not enough to rescue beleaguered chains. PAGE B6 
 FACEBOOK EXTENDS ITS REACH
 Facebook is introducing Facebook Connect, which will allow its members to log onto other Web sites using their Facebook identification and see their friends' activities on those sites. It's part of a shift in thinking in Silicon Valley: instead of trying to hoard information about their users -- a practice fraught with concerns over privacy -- several Internet giants have all announced plans to share at least some of that data so people don't have to enter the same identifying information again and again on different sites.

 UNDER THE HEALTH HALO, THE CALORIES JUST DISAPPEAR
 It seems like a paradox: Americans have paid more and more attention to eating healthfully, but keep getting fatter and fatter. One researcher blames the ''health halo.'' Americans have been seduced into overeating by the so-called health halo associated with certain foods and restaurants. So, John Tierney asks, might New York's pioneering ban on trans fats have done more harm than good? PAGE D1
 THE ALL-ORGANIC CHALLENGE
 Fruits, vegetables and animals can be 100 percent organic. What about people? Dr. Alan Greene, a pediatrician and author from California, decided to find out by eating nothing but organic foods for three years. And although questions remain about whether organic foods are really better for you, he says he has more energy, wakes up earlier and is rarely ill despite constant exposure to sick children. PAGE D5
 IN SOMEONE ELSE'S SHOES, MENTALLY
 Psychotherapists often work to pull people out of themselves or transport them, mentally, into the mind of another. For example, in marriage counseling, couples may role-play to understand a spouse's point of view. Now though, scientists claim they can do the same thing physically. With a ''body-swapping'' illusion, put simply, tricking the brain, people can adopt another human's form, no matter how different, as their own. PAGE D5

 PLAYING FOR THE LOVE OF A SPORT,
 Away From the Varsity Lights
 You can't get a college scholarship for it, but if you are a student seeking to test her mettle against students from other colleges in, say, bass fishing or Brazilian martial arts, intercollegiate club sports could be for you. Club sports, which feature highly skilled, student-organized teams that often belong to regional conferences and play for national collegiate championships, fall outside the purview of the N.C.A.A. and university athletic departments. And their popularity is spreading. PAGE B11
 A DAY AT CITI/TAXPAYER FIELD
 The Mets' new ballpark is still named Citi Field, even as the banking goliath Citigroup receives billions in taxpayer dollars to help right its financial ship. The bailout's upshot? Taxpayers are, in a loose sense, shareholders in the Mets. The downside? Because Citigroup is still under contract to subsidize the Mets' bullpen, which had dozens of late-inning defeats in the last two years, the taxpayer is, too. George Vecsey, Sports of the Times.

HEADLINE: Giving the Mets' New Ballpark a Bad Name

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
With a mixture of rage and pride, I drove past the Mets' new ballpark Monday and noticed that offensive name still up there.
 As Citigroup grovels for a bailout from public funds, the Mets insist the name will not change. Not to give free publicity to these jokers, but as of this moment, the new stadium is still Citi Field.
 My rage gave way to pride, however, knowing that we are all, in a broad sense, shareholders in the Mets. Civic benefactors. Patrons of the arts. Sportsmen and sportswomen, as franchise owners used to call themselves, before we wised up. 
 We are paying for the government subsidy -- socialism at the top -- so that this failing institution can keep its name on the Flushing skyline where Serval Zipper once stood so proudly. 
 How much money? Get your pencils and scorecards ready: last Sunday's New York Times reported that the federal government is investing ''about $20 billion directly and guaranteeing $306 billion in loans and securities on Citigroup's balance sheet.'' 
 The article also said that Citigroup ''effectively suspended its dividend for three years and agreed to limit executives' pay.'' How nice of them. On Monday, a dreadful day for the economy, Citigroup shares plunged 22.2 percent. 
 Yet Citigroup is still under contract to pay $20 million a year for the next 20 years to subsidize the bullpen that launched dozens of late-inning defeats in the past two years. We are enablers all around.
 New ballparks are a source of amusement in the Bronx as well as in Queens. It was recently reported that the Bloomberg administration had bargained 250 extra parking spaces to the Yankees in exchange for a larger luxury box and free food for the high-profile schnorrers from City Hall.
 This disclosure makes it easier to understand why the Bloomberg administration was so compliant about the vanishing of a neighborhood park that was so inconveniently in the way of the new Yankees playpen. The city claims it will eventually put in tiny little parklets on top of garages, but at least the Yankees respect their brand and are not selling their naming rights to some shaky financial institution. 
 For several years, I have been insisting that the Mets should name their new stadium -- partly paid for by the owners, the Wilpon family, with infrastructure mostly subsidized by the city -- after a legitimate New York sports hero who would not embarrass everybody down the line. 
 The most obvious name would have been Jackie Robinson Stadium, but if the standard were somebody who wore the Mets uniform, then what about Gil Hodges Stadium? 
 Meantime, I persist in calling it New Shea, in honor of the lawyer who helped bring the National League back to New York, whose name was proudly affixed to the old dump that is being torn down.
 The Citigroup bailout brought out my populist leanings, and I was toying with the name Power to the People Park. Then I heard that the New York City Council members James S. Oddo and Vincent Ignizio, both Republicans from Staten Island, had proposed the new park be named Citi/Taxpayer Field. Their suggestion kicked up a flurry of approval on the Internet.
 ''A cheeky way to make a point,'' said Oddo, who noted that his colleague, Ignizio, had the idea first. ''These are complex issues,'' Oddo added. ''They go over my head, but this was a way to vent my frustration.''
 Oddo was referring to the worldwide economic crisis brought about, in large part, by American buccaneer capitalists we seem to admire so much, unregulated by government. In terms of lives being affected, it's hardly funny, except for the antic chutzpah of a failing corporation putting its name up in lights, with somebody else's money -- yours and mine. 
 ''This is more of a case of using the office as a bully pulpit,'' said Oddo, who does not claim the City Council has any legal power to take down the annoying name. The response on the Internet has made Oddo appreciate ''the beauty of a snarky comment.'' Previously known for his campaign to ban metal bats, claiming they are dangerous to young players, Oddo does not apologize for his varied interests. 
 ''I can fill a pothole at the same time I spark a debate,'' he said.
 As a lifelong Mets fan, Oddo said, he learned to suffer at an early age. For example, he recalled his trauma in 1981 when Mets catcher Ron Hodges drilled pitcher Craig Swan in the back while trying to stop Tim Raines from stealing second. Swan's rib was broken, and he went on the disabled list.
 Lately, Mets fans have endured two hideous Septembers, which, in a weird way, makes Citigroup and the Mets ideal partners -- ''both entities had collapses,'' Oddo said. And while he professes great admiration for the Mets' general manager, Omar Minaya, Oddo notes that management of bank and ball team have something in common: both retain their jobs.
 The first step is the name. The Mets can do without the $20 million a year, since all they would do with the loot is recruit some other ghastly bullpen. Better they start all over, on the cheap, like the rest of us are learning to do. With apologies to Ronald Reagan: Mr. Wilpon, tear down this sign.

HEADLINE: Germany Aims to Protect Its Interests by Guiding the West's Ties to Russia

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
In the heat of the Georgia crisis in August, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany flew to Russia to warn about the consequences of renewed militarism. Two days later she was in Georgia, voicing support for the country's eventual entry into NATO.
 Autumn crept in and passions cooled. The beginning of October found Mrs. Merkel back in Russia, looking on as the German utility E.ON and the Russian state energy giant Gazprom signed a significant deal in St. Petersburg, giving the German firm a stake in the enormous Yuzhno-Russkoye natural gas field in Siberia.
 Mrs. Merkel's shifting focus served as a reminder of the pivotal role played by Germany in shaping the West's relationship with Russia. It is Russia's largest trading partner, Europe's single biggest economy and one of America's closest allies. Moscow's aggressive posture has not only thrust Russia, a nuclear-armed energy power, back to the geopolitical spotlight. It has also dragged Germany there with it.
 Just as the United States is struggling to redefine its relationship with a resurgent and at times antagonistic government in Moscow, Germany is scrambling to protect the close commercial, cultural and diplomatic ties with Russia it has forged since the end of the cold war -- and, in some areas, long before. 
 How broad that divide has grown will become clearer this week, when NATO foreign ministers gather in Brussels. Berlin and Washington are at odds over how to deal with NATO membership for Georgia and Ukraine -- a tussle that at its heart is about how to deal with Russia.
 As the United States aims mainly to counter Russia's newfound military assertiveness, Germany favors steps to develop Russia economically and ensure its political stability. Germany sees its responsibility to guide Russia, not contain it.
 The incoming Obama administration, which has vowed to pursue a new path to curbing Iran's nuclear ambitions as well as achieving other foreign policy goals that involve Russia, may find that one road to Moscow runs through Berlin. At a minimum, it seems likely to have to address Germany's deeper interests in Russia.
 ''There are serious disagreements between Washington and Berlin from which Moscow can only benefit if there is not better coordination,'' said Angela Stent, who served as the top Russia officer at the United States government's National Intelligence Council from 2004 to 2006 and now directs Russian studies at Georgetown University. ''The Obama administration should work with the Germans as it reassesses U.S. policy toward Russia.''
 Weary of American lectures about the fact that 36 percent of the natural gas that heats German homes comes from Russia, some German politicians wonder how Americans can worry more about this energy dependence than they themselves do.
 ''Many Germans believe Bush only invaded Iraq for oil, and many Americans believe Germany's Russia policy is determined by gas,'' said Karsten D. Voigt, who coordinates German-American relations in the German Foreign Ministry and who for years ran the German-Russian parliamentary group in the German Parliament. ''Every German government since at least the 1970s has tried to bind Russia, and before that the Soviet Union, more closely with Europe.'' 
 Sergei Kupriyanov, a representative of Gazprom, said, ''Our cooperation began during the cold war,'' referring to deals -- opposed by the United States -- that laid gas pipelines between Russia and Germany in the 1970s. ''The Berlin Wall still existed,'' he said. ''Compared to what we had then, Georgia is just peanuts.''
 Germans see not dependence on Russia, but interdependence. The European Union's 27 nations account for 80 percent of the cumulative foreign investment in Russia, a fact starkly exposed -- if the Kremlin ever forgot -- by the flight of capital after the Georgia crisis.
 The Europeans, after Georgia, angrily froze negotiations with Russia over a new partnership agreement. Barely 10 weeks later, they decided to resume the talks. ''We cannot build a European architecture against Russia or without Russia, only with Russia,'' said Alexander Rahr, director of the Russian/Eurasian program at the German Council on Foreign Relations.
 While Germany needs Russia's raw materials and covets the significant market there for its precision machine tools, Russia is equally dependent on European investment to diversify its economy, a fact driven home all too clearly for Russians now that the financial crisis has sent energy prices plunging.
 In the city of Yaroslavl, an automotive company, the GAZ Group, still makes diesel truck engines in a factory first built in the waning days of czarist rule in 1916. The production model evokes Soviet times, starting with iron in the foundry on the site, with workers building almost the entire engine from scratch.
 A short drive away, past clusters of birch trees, is a field of concrete, metal trusses and corrugated iron roofing. It is the beginning of a state-of-the-art production plant for the company's new engine model, a project valued at $442 million.
 The plant sits a few hours north of Moscow by car, but the names of the suppliers sound like a roll call of German industry, with most of the new machinery and production lines supplied by German companies like Grob-Werke and ThyssenKrupp Krause.
 ''Germany is, in terms of technology, expertise and know how in the automotive industry, I think the best in the world,'' said Ruslan Grekov, the project director for the new engine in Yaroslavl. ''Of course, Germany is different from Russia. The difference is good.''
 Such sentiments might seem surprising, even jarring, in a country where, in Soviet times, Nazis were vilified in a daily diet of war movies.
 But the bonds between Europe's two largest countries were forged over centuries, as German nobles like Catherine the Great became Russian royalty and German generals led the czar's armies. German craftsmen worked in Moscow while German farmers settled near the Volga River.
 The relationship has been tempered on the German side with guilt over World War II and gratitude over German reunification.
 But always the anchor has been business, with Germany's technical skill complementing Russia's vast resources. The German conglomerate Siemens laid the Russian state telegraph network in the 1850s. Stalin built Soviet industrial might in his first Five-Year Plan in large part with German machines.
 The current global slowdown has sent ripples of fear across Russia about a possible repeat of the 1998 collapse of the ruble. The World Bank halved its expectation for Russian growth next year, but it was still 3 percent, whereas the German economy, already in recession, is expected to contract, making Russia all the more important as layoffs in Germany mount.
 Trade between Russia and Germany grew 25 percent to $49.3 billion in the first half of the year. Russia is one of Germany's fastest-growing markets. Last year, German exports to Russia totaled $36 billion, more than five times the $6.7 billion exported from the United States to Russia.
 German businessmen not only work out of sales offices in Moscow or invest in the country's rich oil and gas fields. They are all over -- from Siberia to Yekaterinburg to St. Petersburg, with some 4,600 companies in all investing $13.2 billion, building factories and delivering machinery to Russians who aspire to be more than the raw-goods store for European neighbors.
 Today, Siemens is supplying Russia with its first high-speed trains, known as the Velaro RUS. The contract is worth $758 million for Siemens, half for the trains and half for servicing.
 The oligarch Roman Abramovich's construction firm Infrastruktura announced this year that it had ordered the world's largest drill from the German company Herrenknecht to bore tunnels in Moscow and near Sochi in preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics.
 Igor Yurgens, executive board chairman at the Institute of Contemporary Development in Moscow, of which President Dimitri A. Medvedev is board chairman, said Germany was a strategic partner and the most patient investor in Russia's future.
 ''We do not have laws in this country, but we have a lot of friendships, and friendship is more important than laws,'' Mr. Yurgens said, in an interview in his Moscow office just off the city's Garden Ring Road, where sputtering old Ladas inch through jams alongside late-model Mercedes sedans. ''That's historically so. And with Germans, this is the case.'' 
 ''On the background of this economic very strong cooperation and involvement, their criticism is taken a bit more lightly than the criticism of some others who do nothing at all, but just keep criticizing,'' Mr. Yurgens added.
 When Mr. Medvedev threatened after the American election to place new missiles in Kaliningrad, the location was a symbol of the painful, complex relationship between Russia and Germany. That island of Russian territory -- awkwardly perched between the NATO members Poland and Lithuania -- was the German city of Konigsberg before it fell to the Soviets in the wake of World War II.
 Yet in a sign of the opportunities presented by the Russian-German-American triangle, it was Germany's foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, from the usually Russia-friendly Social Democrats, who issued perhaps the sternest rebuff to Mr. Medvedev. It was ''the wrong signal at the wrong time,'' Mr. Steinmeier said the next day. 
 The incoming Obama administration, German officials say quietly, should take note. As indicated by Mr. Medvedev's backpedaling since, the Russians apparently did.

HEADLINE: Where History Intersects With the Bailout

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

DATELINE: The Bank of New York 

 BODY:
America's first financial firm -- was founded in a rich man's house on Pearl Street in 1784. While it is no surprise that the august institution has a long history of business in the country, it is less well known that it has also made a business of the country's history -- writing, for example, the first loan to the federal government (for $20,000) that helped retire debts from the Revolutionary War.
 The original copy of that note hangs today in a small alcove just outside the office of Robert P. Kelly, the chairman and chief executive of the bank, who, much like those before him, is elaborately entangled in the nation's financial fate. Just six weeks ago, in fact, the Treasury Department named his bank -- now called the Bank of New York Mellon -- the master custodian of the Troubled Assets Relief Program (known in the vernacular as the Massive Wall Street Bailout). Given Mr. Kelly's centrality to the economy, one wonders what is -- literally -- on his desk. 
 Beyond a clock, a cloisonne pen jar and a surprisingly empty outbox, there are hastily scribbled notes on a monogrammed pad from a meeting with a certain ''Tim G.'' (Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and Barack Obama's pick to run the Treasury?). The notes make reference to ''ad com updates'' and ''FVA's,'' and contain the jotted notion that the current situation may not be a ''pushback issue'' after all. 
 ''I can't tell you how many people have come to me recently and said, 'I hope you're keeping notes,' '' Mr. Kelly, a self-described history buff, confessed. ''But it's not like this is stuff that you forget. I always have a sense of gravitas and of history in the making.'' 
 History, like a powerful smell, is everywhere in Mr. Kelly's office: in its address (1 Wall Street); in its artwork (antique paintings); in its century-old grandfather clock, which stands there like a footman at the wall. But the office's most historic piece is the view from out the window: It is of Alexander Hamilton's grave -- resting place of the bank's founder -- 10 stories down in the Trinity Church cemetery directly across the street.
 History, of course, can be a guidepost, but it can also be a burden, and a metaphorist could surely make much of the fact that Mr. Kelly's office is wedged between a graveyard and the Stock Exchange. There are those who have complained his bank is too ensconced in the establishment to oversee the bailout, but as Hamilton, the elitist, might have said: Experience sometimes counts. 
 As for Mr. Kelly, he is tangibly aware that a page torn from his notepad might easily hang one day beside that bank note in the alcove. Such thoughts tend to give a man the long view of the rush of daily events.
 In fact, he told a story of Moshe Dayan, the great Israeli general, who was scouting out a battlefield near Syria one day. He took his fellow generals to the border and showed them with a finger where he planned to place his infantry and tanks.
 ''And the generals were amazed,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''They said: 'We've never done this before. How do you know where they should go?' Dayan explained that actually, this battle had been fought a dozen times in the last 2,000 years. 
 '' 'We're just doing it again,' he said. 'Right now.' ''

HEADLINE: Officials Warn That Economy Will Remain Weak

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM and DAVID STOUT

 BODY:
The federal government's top fiscal-policy officials warned on Monday that the economy will probably remain weak, at least for the near future, but they expressed optimism for the long haul and said Washington would continue to deal aggressively with the crisis. 
 Addressing critics of the Federal Reserve's response to the crisis, the central bank's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, defended the Fed's actions on Monday, calling them ''exceptionally rapid and proactive'' measures that had helped stabilize the economy. 
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., meanwhile, acknowledged that ''the journey ahead will continue to be a difficult one.'' But he said he was confident that ''we are pursuing the right strategy to stabilize the financial system and support the flow of credit into our economy.''
 In a speech in Austin, Tex., Mr. Bernanke warned that the economy would ''probably remain weak for a time,'' with particular problems ahead for exports and household spending. He called for broad new regulations that would allow the Fed more flexibility in assisting institutions considered ''critical'' to the health of the economy.
 But, in response to a question, he said that the current economic conditions -- even with the recession now official -- bear ''no comparison in terms of severity'' to the 1930s, a period that Mr. Bernanke has studied extensively.
 Mr. Paulson, speaking at the Fortune 500 Forum in Washington, said there was ''no single action the federal government can take'' to ease the crisis. But he reiterated his pledge to be flexible as well as aggressive. 
 ''We are actively engaged in developing additional programs to strengthen our financial system so that lending flows into our economy,'' he said. And he once again prodded banks, which collectively have benefited from Washington's efforts to shore up the financial system, to do their part to get credit flowing freely again.
 ''We expect banks to increase their lending as a result of these efforts, and it is important that they do so,'' Mr. Paulson said.
 Mr. Bernanke acknowledged the limitations of the Fed's conventional policy-setting tool, the interest rate, and suggested that future actions by the Fed would focus on providing liquidity to the financial system by directly buying securities and acting as a backstop for the credit markets. He also indicated that the Fed was prepared to cut rates again in December.
 It was his first major policy speech since the end of October. The four weeks since then have brought a federal bailout of Citigroup, billions more in financing for the troubled insurance giant American International Group and another frightening swoon in the stock markets. The Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 400 points in the hour before the chairman delivered his remarks.
 In his comments, Mr. Bernanke acknowledged the limits of the Fed's actions from the last few months. ''Judging the effectiveness of the Federal Reserve's liquidity programs is difficult,'' he said, noting that credit markets had not yet returned to normal despite the enormous amount of liquidity poured into the system. 
 ''But,'' he said, ''I am confident that market functioning would have been more seriously impaired in the absence of our actions.'' 
 Mr. Bernanke described the Fed's actions as necessary to stabilize the economy in a time of crisis. He said that concerns about ''moral hazard'' stemming from the bailouts should be addressed after the initial shocks from the crisis had begun to fade, and noted that the long-term goal was for banks and other financial institutions to stand again on their own two feet.
 ''The government should intervene in markets only in exceptional circumstances,'' he said. ''However, in my view, the failure of a major financial institution at a time when financial markets already quite fragile poses too great a threat to financial and economic stability to be ignored. In such cases, intervention is necessary to protect the public interest.''
 ''Once financial conditions become more normal, the extraordinary provision of liquidity by the Federal Reserve will no longer be needed,'' he said.
 He acknowledged the process of returning to self-sufficiency was ''likely to take some time,'' and called for the government to develop a regulatory infrastructure that would help prevent the collapse of major nonbank institutions, like A.I.G. 
 Mr. Bernanke's outlook for the economy, like Mr. Paulson's, was grim, at least for the short term. ''The likely duration of the financial turmoil is difficult to judge,'' he said. ''But even if the functioning of financial markets continues to improve, economic conditions will probably remain weak for a time.''
 He said that ''cumulating job losses, weak consumer confidence, and a lack of credit availability'' would depress consumer spending, traditionally the engine of American economic growth, and noted that exports were ''not likely to be as great a source of strength for U.S. economic activity in coming quarters as they had been earlier this year.''
 Higher prices for energy and consumer products have receded, he said. ''Inflation appears set to decline significantly over the next year toward levels consistent with price stability.''
 ''To avoid inflation in the long run and to allow short-term interest rates ultimately to return to normal levels, the Fed's balance sheet will eventually have to be brought back to a more sustainable level,'' he said, adding that the Federal Open Market Committee ''will ensure that that is done in a timely way. However, that is an issue for the future; for now, the goal of policy must be to support financial markets and the economy.''

HEADLINE: Treasury's Lead Role in China in Flux

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. leaves office next month, Washington will lose its No. 1 China hand. Mr. Paulson, who spent years cultivating Chinese leaders as a Wall Street banker, has spearheaded American policy toward Beijing since 2006.
 That raises some big questions, including who will pick up Mr. Paulson's baton in the Obama administration, and whether the Treasury Department will continue to be the lead agency in steering a relationship increasingly defined by China's yawning trade gap with the United States. 
 On Tuesday, Mr. Paulson will lead a delegation of cabinet officials to China to hold economic talks, the fifth and, for him, final round of semiannual meetings known as the ''strategic economic dialogue.''
 A range of issues are likely to be on the table, including energy, the environment and the economic crisis. Experts said the global downturn could fray American-Chinese ties, as China promotes exports to fuel its rapidly slowing economy at the same time that the United States is limping.
 In an interview, Mr. Paulson said he worried that the crisis could set off a wave of protectionism on both sides of the Pacific. He said he planned to press the Chinese on recent measures like their increased tax rebates for exporters, which make Chinese goods cheaper in Europe and the United States.
 ''Hank Paulson has a tremendous fervor for these issues that I don't know if Tim Geithner has or not,'' said Kenneth Lieberthal, a China specialist now at the Brookings Institution, referring to President-elect Barack Obama's choice for Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner.
 ''One possibility is that the strategic economic dialogue continues, but moves to another venue in the government,'' said Mr. Lieberthal, who worked on China policy in the Clinton administration.
 As possible coordinators of China policy, he mentioned Lawrence H. Summers, newly named chairman of the National Economic Council, or Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. Then there is Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Obama's choice for secretary of state.
 What none of these people has is the lengthy China experience that Mr. Paulson brought with him from Goldman Sachs. Mr. Geithner comes closest, having studied in China and served as a diplomat in Tokyo, as well as under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs.
 A spokeswoman for Mr. Obama, Brooke Anderson, declined to comment on the president-elect's plans for China policy, except to point to a recent essay by Mr. Obama, in which he called for ''fresh thinking and a change from the U.S. policy approach of the past eight years.''
 China could pose a thorny challenge to Mr. Obama, experts said, because its trade surplus with the United States -- already a record, at $35.2 billion, in October -- is likely to swell further in the next few months.
 That is partly because of the tax rebates. The rebates apply to more than half the Chinese goods covered by trade tariffs, and while they do not violate World Trade Organization provisions, experts view them as a form of protectionism.
 ''We've always thought China's export rebates are a bigger driver of their trade relationship than the exchange rate,'' said John Frisbie, the president of the U.S.-China Business Council.
 With a recession biting in the United States, experts say, these new Chinese measures could reignite calls in Congress to punish China over its trade practices.
 ''If we're heading toward 9 percent or 10 percent unemployment, and people look around and see China running larger and larger surpluses, they're going to say, 'What's going on here?' '' said Nicholas Lardy, an expert on the Chinese economy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
 In June, with growth slowing, China also ended a brief experiment in letting its currency rise in value against the dollar.
 Before that, the currency had risen 20 percent against the dollar in the last two years, as the Chinese central bank stopped intervening in the currency market.
 With Chinese factories shutting down, and the government worried about rising unemployment and social unrest, experts said it was unrealistic to expect China to show flexibility on its currency now. Besides, some noted, China's currency, by maintaining its peg to the dollar, has risen in relation to the currencies of other trading partners because the financial crisis has driven up the dollar.
 Mr. Paulson said he was disappointed that the United States had not been able to push China further on its currency. But he said it was only the strategic economic dialogue that prevented Congress from passing legislation that would have deepened the tensions between the countries.
 ''When we started this, I was told we weren't going to be able to avoid currency legislation in Congress,'' he said. ''We never got as much as we would have liked'' from the Chinese, he added, ''but people recognize we got a lot more than we would have without the dialogue.''
 Mr. Paulson said the dialogue had also been useful on difficult issues like product and food safety, as well as the environment. China had rolled back some energy subsidies after the last meeting in June.
 Mr. Paulson demurred on the question of how the Obama administration should handle China relations, though he noted that Mr. Geithner, whom he knows well from the government's rescue effort, speaks Mandarin.
 For his part, Mr. Paulson said he expected China to play a part in his life after the Treasury, though he draws the line at learning Mandarin. ''I've got a very poor ear for languages,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fresh Blood From an Old Wound

BYLINE: By PANKAJ MISHRA. 
Pankaj Mishra is the author of ''Temptations of the West: How to Be Modern in India, Pakistan, Tibet and Beyond.''

 BODY:
MIDWAY through last week's murderous rampage in Mumbai, one of the suspected gunmen at the besieged Jewish center called a popular Indian TV channel. Speaking in Urdu (the primary language of Pakistan and many Indian Muslims), he ranted against the recent visit of an Israeli general to the Indian-ruled section of the Kashmir Valley. Referring to the Pakistan-backed insurgency in the valley, and the Indian military response to it, he asked, ''Are you aware how many people have been killed in Kashmir?''
 In a separate phone call, another gunman invoked the oppression of Muslims by Hindu nationalists and the destruction of the Babri Mosque in Ayodhya in 1992. Such calls were the only occasions on which the militants, whom initial reports have tied to the Pakistani jihadist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, offered a likely motive for their indiscriminate slaughter. Their rhetoric seems all too familiar. Nevertheless, it shows how older political conflicts in South Asia have been rendered more noxious by the fallout from the ''war on terror'' and the rise of international jihadism. 
 Pakistan, a nation-state founded on Islam, has long claimed Muslim-majority Kashmir, and has fought three wars with India over it since 1947. In the early 1990s, as an anti-India insurgency in Kashmir intensified, groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba became the Pakistani government's proxies in its war of attrition with its neighbor. 
 American pressure after 9/11 forced Pakistan's president, Pervez Musharraf, to ban Lashkar-e-Taiba, which had developed links with the Taliban and Al Qaeda. With General Musharraf's departure from office in September, it would be no surprise if this turned out to be the Muslim group's first major atrocity since 2001.
 Pakistan's new civilian government is too weak to control either the extremist groups within the country or the various rogue elements within its military and intelligence. The American military was reported to have started bombing supposed terrorist hideouts inside Pakistan's borders even as General Musharraf stumbled to the exit. As its increasingly desperate pleas to the Bush administration to stop the attacks go unheeded, Pakistan's government appears pathetically helpless to its own citizens. 
 The sense of humiliation and impotence that this loss of sovereignty creates in Pakistan, a country with a strong tradition of populist nationalism, cannot be underestimated. 
 Meanwhile, India's influence in Afghanistan has grown as it pours reconstruction money into the country, as have its military ties with Israel. Add to this the Bush administration's decision to reward India with an extraordinarily generous nuclear deal and to more or less ignore Kashmir, where in August Indian security forces brutally suppressed the biggest nonviolent demonstrations in the valley's history, and recent attacks against the Indian Embassy in Kabul, the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad, and now in Mumbai begin to appear to be connected by more than chronology. 
 Meanwhile, Indian intelligence experts and others suspect that jihadists and disaffected members of Pakistan's armed forces and intelligence agencies have forged closer links and, as the string of recent bomb attacks on Indian cities reveals, are rapidly making new allies among the 13 percent of Indians who are Muslim. 
 It is very likely that Barack Obama will take a different tack from the Bush administration in antiterrorism efforts in South Asia. In an interview with MSNBC last month, he said that his administration would encourage India to solve the Kashmir dispute with Pakistan, so that Islamabad can cooperate with the United States in Afghanistan. 
 The idea that the road to stability in South Asia goes through Kashmir is as persuasive as the notion that the path to peace in the Middle East goes through Jerusalem. It is also equally hard to realize. Mr. Obama could act quickly to stem growing extremism in Pakistan and strengthen civilian authority by ending American missile attacks within its borders and shifting the allied strategy in Afghanistan away from military force and toward political nation-building and economic reconstruction. At the same time, he will have to find a solution in Kashmir that endows its Muslims with a measure of autonomy while pacifying extremists in both India and Pakistan. 
 The new president's moral and intellectual authority will be vital in negotiations with India, which, like China regarding Tibet, adamantly rejects third-party mediation in Kashmir. Mr. Obama could point out the obvious to Indian leaders: they have paid a huge price for their intransigence over Kashmir, with an estimated 80,000 dead in the valley in the last two decades and a resultant rise in terrorist attacks across India. 
 Indeed, the outrage in Mumbai is the latest and clearest sign that the price of India's uncompromising stance on Kashmir has become too high, imperiling its economy as well as its security. Indian anger over the fumbling response to the brazen attacks disguises the panicky realization that there can be no effective defense against terrorists in a country with a long coastline and densely populated cities. The best India can hope for is to improve what Ratan Tata -- the country's leading industrialist and the owner of last week's main terrorist target, Mumbai's Taj hotel -- calls ''crisis management.'' 
 As the economy falters (Mumbai's stock market has lost nearly 60 percent of its value this year), India can barely cope with homegrown violent movements like the Maoist insurgency in its central states, which Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has described as the biggest internal security threat to India since independence.
 Pointing to the Bush administration's vigorous response to 9/11, Indian commentators lament that India is a ''soft state,'' unable to defend itself from internal and external enemies. But India cannot turn into a ''hard'' state without swiftly undermining its secular, multicultural democracy.
 The government has already experimented with draconian laws like the Prevention of Terrorist Activities Act of 2002, which among other measures allowed the police to hold suspects without charge for six months. It was repealed in 2004 after many abuses against Muslims were revealed. While these attacks may lead to calls for more tough measures, Indians cannot lose sight of the peril that 150 million Muslims would lose their faith in India's political and legal system. And it is obviously dangerous to threaten Pakistan, a nuclear-armed state, with war.
 As president, Mr. Obama could conceivably persuade India and Pakistan to see the virtue of a political solution to Kashmir. But he would first have to set an example by rejecting the false assumptions of a global war on terrorism based primarily on military force -- assumptions that the elites of powerful countries with restive minorities like India, China and Russia have eagerly embraced since 9/11. 
 ''The people of India deeply love you,'' Prime Minister Singh said to President Bush in September while thanking him for the nuclear deal. Yet it is President-elect Obama who has the opportunity to create deeper and more enduring alliances for the United States in South Asia -- and he should start with Kashmir.

HEADLINE: 'Our National Security Team'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from statements made by President-elect Barack Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton at a news conference in Chicago on Monday, when Mr. Obama announced the choices for his national security team, including Mrs. Clinton as secretary of state, as recorded by Congressional Quarterly: 
 MR. OBAMA: Last week, we announced our economic team, which is working as we speak to craft an economic recovery program to create jobs and grow our struggling economy.
 Today, Vice President-elect Biden and I are pleased to announce our national security team. The national security challenges we face are just as great and just as urgent as our economic crisis. We are fighting two wars. Our old conflicts remain unresolved. And newly asserted powers have put strains on the international system.
 The spread of nuclear weapons raises the peril that the world's deadliest technologies could fall into dangerous hands. Our dependence on foreign oil empowers authoritarian governments and endangers our planet.
 America must also be strong at home to be strong abroad. We need to provide education and opportunity to all our citizens so every American can compete with anyone anywhere. And our economic power must sustain our military strength, our diplomatic leverage and our global leadership.
 The common thread linking these challenges is the fundamental reality that in the 21st century, our destiny is shared with the world's, from our markets to our security. From our public health to our climate, we must act with that understanding that now, more than ever, we have a stake in what happens across the globe. And as we learned so painfully on 9/11, terror cannot be contained by borders nor safety provided by oceans alone. ...
 MRS. CLINTON: Mr. President-elect, thank you for this honor. If confirmed, I will give this assignment, your administration and our country my all. I also want to thank my fellow New Yorkers who have, for eight years, given me the joy of a job I love with the opportunity to work on issues I care about deeply in a state that I cherish. And you've also helped prepare me well for this new role. After all, New Yorkers aren't afraid to speak their minds and do so in every language. ...
 The fate of our nation and the future of our children will be forged in the crucible of these global challenges. America cannot solve these crises without the world, and the world cannot solve them without America. ...
 We must pursue vigorous diplomacy using all the tools we can muster to build a future with more partners and fewer adversaries, more opportunities and fewer dangers for all who seek freedom, peace and prosperity.

HEADLINE: Democrats in House Plan a Package of Up to $500 Billion to Help States

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
House Democrats said Monday that they would try to pass an economic recovery bill costing $400 billion to $500 billion next month as governors pressed Congress for money to build roads and bridges, provide health care to low-income people and develop alternative sources of energy.
 Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she hoped Congress would be able to deliver a bill to President-elect Barack Obama when he takes office, or a few days later. 
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, has said he expects a cost of $500 billion. But aides to Mr. Reid said that Democrats would need to negotiate with Republicans to ensure swift approval of such a large package in the Senate.
 Ms. Pelosi met Monday with the chairman of the National Governors Association, Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, a Democrat, and the vice chairman, Gov. Jim Douglas of Vermont, a Republican. Mr. Obama met with Democratic governors at a reception in Philadelphia on Monday and is set to meet with most governors on Tuesday.
 Brendan Daly, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi, said she was ''sympathetic to the need for infrastructure spending and helping the states with Medicaid.''
 Mr. Rendell said the states had $136 billion of transportation and public works projects ''ready to go.'' States, he said, want to use the money for roads and bridges, airports, transit systems, ports, railways, schools, waste water treatment plants and broadband networks. ''Every billion dollars spent on infrastructure produces 40,000 new jobs,'' he said.
 Congressional Democrats said the economic recovery bill was likely to include a middle-class tax cut that Mr. Obama wants.
 Asked about the outlook for a stimulus bill, James P. Manley, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, said: ''It depends on what we can negotiate with Senate Republicans. The only way we'll be able to get something done quickly is if we have negotiations that include the House Democratic leadership, House and Senate Republicans and the president.''
 Many economists say Congress could negate the benefits of any economic stimulus if it tried to hold down spending or reduce the budget deficit.
 But Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, said he would ''insist that Congress make a serious effort to offset a good portion of any new spending.''
 In an interview, Mr. Coburn, who has delayed or frustrated many past Democratic proposals, said, ''There's nothing wrong with infrastructure projects if we take a Keynesian approach to stimulate the economy.'' But, he said, Congress must also eliminate tens of billions of dollars in government waste and fraud. 
 Mr. Coburn also questioned the Medicaid proposal. ''The purpose of any legislation should be to stimulate the economy, not to bail out the states,'' he said.
 Mr. Douglas said the governors wanted Congress to authorize a two-year increase in the federal share of Medicaid, the health program for more than 60 million low-income people. The need for assistance is growing as state revenues are shrinking, he said.
 The governors said they hoped Congress would provide at least $20 billion more for Medicaid. The program is financed jointly by the federal government and the states, with the federal share accounting for $201 billion, or about 57 percent, in the last year.
 ''We are not here with a tin cup,'' Mr. Douglas said. States, he said, have already begun to pare spending as their tax collections decline. The economic slump is reducing many types of state revenue, including taxes on personal income and capital gains.
 The National Bureau of Economic Research, a private group of leading economists who define the beginning and end of business cycles, said Monday that the United States had been in a recession since December 2007.
 The National Conference of State Legislatures joined the governors in appealing to Congress for swift action. ''States are cutting their budgets, freezing hiring and delaying capital projects,'' said Joe Hackney, a Democrat who is speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives and president of the conference. ''This can accelerate the downturn in our national economy.''
 Mr. Douglas said he feared the recession would have ''a cascading effect'' on states: ''Economic activity declines, investment is lower, the number of jobs decreases, income tax receipts are down, and so state fiscal pictures begin to deteriorate.''
 President Bush opposed an economic stimulus bill in September, saying money spent on transportation projects ''would not create a substantial number of jobs in the near future.'' To address that concern, Mr. Rendell said Congress could set deadlines for construction to start within a few months.

HEADLINE: A Team Of Whizzes

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
Barack Obama appears to have put together an extraordinarily competent team to cope with the crises abroad and at home -- and to begin cleaning up the mess of the past eight years.
 So why do I have this uneasy feeling?
 Hillary Clinton, Robert Gates, Eric Holder, Rahm Emanuel, Larry Summers ... 
 Competence is clearly trumping ideology in the next administration, and lord knows after two terms of Bush & Co. it's time to get back to the idea of smart, capable people advising the president and executing his policies.
 What I wonder is whether the members of this team, in addition to their grasp of the issues and success at achieving power, have a real feel for the needs of the people they are supposed to be representing.
 I don't doubt that they have the best of intentions. But the people at the pinnacle of power in Washington are encased in a bubble that makes it extremely hard to hear the voices of those who aren't already powerful themselves.
 On Monday, the president-elect introduced a national security team that will face a nightmarish array of challenges: the promised drawdown in Iraq; a worsening situation in Afghanistan; the crisis unfolding in India and Pakistan; and so on.
 But it also has a responsibility to look out for the members of the military who are exhausted from years of valiant service. Many have served three and four (or more) tours in combat, and many thousands have been wounded in mind and body and are having a difficult time putting their lives back together.
 So a challenge as important as the challenges in Iraq and Afghanistan is to send the message -- and make it stick -- that more Americans need to share in the sacrifices required to keep the nation and its interests secure.
 President-elect Obama campaigned on the mantra of change. For years the federal government catered increasingly to the interests of the wealthy and the powerful. This reached a destructive crescendo when the ideologues and incompetents of the Bush administration came to power.
 That is what needs to change.
 Will this new Obama team, as brilliant as it appears to be, begin addressing on day one the interests of those who are not rich and who have not had the ear of those in power?
 I think about the cops and firefighters and factory workers and schoolteachers and hospital aides and bank tellers and truck drivers who are having trouble making ends meet, hanging onto their homes, sending their children to college.
 Will this new administration really be looking out for them?
 One of the reasons the economy is so deeply in the tank is that ordinary Americans have not received a fair share of the economic advances of the past several years. You don't hear much about this. Americans have been working harder and harder, and more and more efficiently (we are now the hardest working people on the planet, having passed the Japanese in this category), but ordinary workers have not been paid for this enhanced productivity.
 As my colleague at The Times, Steven Greenhouse, pointed out in his book ''The Big Squeeze: Tough Times for the American Worker,'' published earlier this year:
 ''Even though corporate profits have doubled since recession gave way to economic expansion in November 2001, and even though employee productivity has risen more than 15 percent since then, the average wage for the typical American worker has inched up just 1 percent (after inflation).'' 
 That was part of a pattern of gross unfairness that has been unfolding for some three decades. No wonder people have depleted their savings and maxed out their credit cards.
 The crisis now, of course, is not that wages are stagnant but that the jobs themselves are disappearing. It's not just change that the nation needs, but big change.
 President-elect Obama has talked of a ''new dawn of American leadership.'' Three-quarters of a century ago, Franklin Roosevelt promised a New Deal and said his biggest task was ''to put people to work.'' 
 That's as appropriate a cue as any for the next president. I hope Mr. Obama's ''new dawn'' portends more than just a few nibbles around the edges of change. We need change that brings about more shared sacrifice in wartime and tough times, and a more equitable distribution of the nation's resources all the time.
 I want to know who in the Obama administration will be listening to the young girl on the South Side of Chicago whose future is constrained by a lousy public school, and the factory worker in Toledo whose family's future has been trampled by unrestrained corporate greed and unfair trade policies.
 All the evidence is that the next administration will be competent and smart as hell. Now I'd like to know for whom they plan to deliver.

HEADLINE: J.&J. to Buy Manufacturer Of Cosmetic Surgery Gear

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Johnson & Johnson said Monday it would buy Mentor, a maker of cosmetic products and breast implants, for $1.07 billion, a move that would help the drug maker become a major player in cosmetic and reconstructive surgery. 
 Analysts said Johnson & Johnson was paying ''a giant premium'' for Mentor, which makes MemoryGel breast implants, liposuction equipment and skin repair products.
 Under the deal, Johnson & Johnson will start a cash tender offer for $31 a share -- nearly double Mentor's Friday closing price of $16.15. The drug company will also assume Mentor's debt, about $50 million, and make the company a stand-alone unit in its Ethicon business, a top provider of sutures, mesh and other surgical products. Mentor, based in Santa Barbara, Calif., has about 1,300 employees and had $373 million in 2007 sales.
 Mentor shares jumped $14.43 on Monday, or 89 percent, to $30.58 in afternoon trading; J.& J. shares, weighed down by a big decline in the broader market, fell $3.25, or 5.5 percent, to $55.33.
 ''It's a good space for J.& J. to get bigger in because it's a space with the least cost-control pricing pressures,'' as patients, rather than insurers or government health programs, generally pay for cosmetic surgery, said Erik Gordon, associate dean and head of biomedical industry programs at Stevens Institute of Technology.
 Johnson & Johnson this summer introduced a collagen-based skin filler called Evolence. Some products made by Ethicon are being used in plastic surgery, including sutures, mesh implants for facelifts, and harmonic scalpels, said Bill Price, a spokesman for the company.
 The deal is expected to reduce Johnson & Johnson's 2009 earnings by 3 to 5 cents a share and is scheduled to close during the first quarter. Mentor's chief executive, Joshua H. Levine, will stay on as a member of Ethicon's global management board, Mr. Price said. Significant layoffs are not expected.
 Mentor's main competitor in the breast implant market is Allergan, the maker of Botox. Mentor is developing its own anti-wrinkle injection and dermal fillers to compete.
 On Nov. 24, Johnson & Johnson bought Omrix Biopharmaceuticals, a biotech company, for $438 million. The deal is expected to close this month.
 Mr. Gordon said he expected more acquisitions -- by J.& J. and by pharmaceutical companies that have too weak a pipeline to support their overhead and need to either acquire products or merge with another large company and slash costs.
 Over all, portions of the health care sector with cash-heavy balance sheets, like big drug makers, have been more open to acquisitions during the current recession.

HEADLINE: With His Cabinet Appointments, Obama Puts the Campaign Behind Him

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Helene Cooper contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama put the rancor and even some of the rhetoric of the presidential campaign behind him on Monday as he welcomed his chief Democratic adversary into his cabinet and signaled flexibility in his plans to withdraw troops from Iraq.
 Introducing a national security team anchored by Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, Mr. Obama said a new strategic agreement with Baghdad put the United States ''on a glide path to reduce our forces in Iraq.'' But while he reaffirmed his desire to pull out combat brigades within 16 months, Mr. Obama emphasized his willingness to consider options put forth by the military.
 ''I believe that 16 months is the right timeframe,'' Mr. Obama said at a news conference, with Mrs. Clinton and Robert M. Gates, whom he is keeping on as defense secretary, as well as other appointees. ''But as I have said consistently, I will listen to the recommendations of my commanders. And my No. 1 priority is making sure that our troops remain safe in this transition phase and that the Iraqi people are well served by a government that is taking on increased responsibility for its own security.'' 
 Mr. Obama has long qualified his withdrawal pledge, but in the campaign the emphasis was on his intent to end the war. Now that he is taking office in 50 days, he is calibrating his statements to leave room to maneuver, knowing that some senior military officers are wary of moving too quickly and that the defense secretary he just reappointed has cautioned about timetables.
 The impression left by the event at a downtown Chicago hotel ballroom was of a political leader converting to governance from electioneering. Most striking in that regard was the sight of Mr. Obama side by side with Mrs. Clinton, whose foreign-policy judgment and credentials he questioned just months ago, and Mr. Gates, who has for the last two years run the war Mr. Obama condemned for a president he denounced.
 Mr. Obama essentially said Americans should not take too seriously some of the things said during ''the heat of a campaign.'' Reminded of some of his caustic criticism of Mrs. Clinton's foreign policy experience -- ''grossly exaggerated,'' his campaign called it -- Mr. Obama shrugged off the discordant notes with a smile.
 ''This is fun for the press to try to stir up whatever quotes were generated during the course of the campaign,'' he said. He went on to say that he and Mrs. Clinton shared a broad view of American interests, and he praised her experience.
 ''She is going to be an outstanding secretary of state,'' Mr. Obama said. ''And if I didn't believe that, I wouldn't have offered her the job. And if she didn't believe that I was equipped to lead this nation in such a difficult time, she would not have accepted.''
 In deference to Mrs. Clinton's stature (and later the others), Mr. Obama gave her an opportunity to make a statement from the lectern, something he did not do with any of his economic appointees last week, and she promised to give ''my all'' to him and his administration. ''I am proud to join you on what will be a difficult and exciting adventure in this new century,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''And may God bless you and all who serve with you and our great country.''
 The body language was friendly and appropriate, if not necessarily personal. Standing behind Mr. Obama during his remarks, Mrs. Clinton nodded as he spoke of the nation's challenges; after the event ended, the two walked out of the room arm in arm, her hand gently patting his back.
 Besides formally announcing Mrs. Clinton's nomination, Mr. Obama said he was keeping on Mr. Gates, and while some close to the transition had suggested it would be a short-term holdover, the president-elect put no time limit on the Pentagon chief's tenure. Mr. Obama also introduced Gen. James L. Jones, a retired Marine commandant and North Atlantic Treaty Organization supreme commander, as his national security adviser and confirmed plans to nominate Eric H. Holder Jr., a former deputy attorney general, for attorney general; Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona for secretary of homeland security; and Susan E. Rice, a former assistant secretary of state, for ambassador to the United Nations.
 Mr. Obama's remarks on Iraq signaled a careful approach to scaling back the mission there as he plans to send more forces to Afghanistan. The Iraqi Parliament has approved a strategic agreement requiring American combat forces to pull out of cities by June 2009 and all American troops to leave the country by the end of 2011.
 The president-elect did not embrace the particulars but said the agreement ''points us in the right direction.'' He also reminded Americans that he said during the campaign that American forces would remain in Iraq even after the withdrawal of those designated as combat brigades. It is ''likely to be necessary to maintain a residual force to provide potential training, logistical support to protect our civilians in Iraq,'' he said.
 Mr. Obama expressed concern that militants could exploit the withdrawal. ''We will have to remain vigilant in making sure that any terrorist elements that remain in Iraq do not become strengthened as a consequence of our drawdown,'' he said.
 Beyond Iraq, Mr. Obama gave little indication of his first moves in foreign policy. Two leading research groups plan to issue a report Tuesday calling on him to move quickly to open direct diplomatic talks with Iran without preconditions.
 The report by the groups, the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution and the Council on Foreign Relations, urges Mr. Obama to put all issues on the table with Iran, including its nuclear program. The proposal calls for ''swift early steps'' to exploit a ''honeymoon'' period between his inauguration and the internal political jockeying preceding Iran's presidential elections in June.
 The report breaks with experts on Iran who say Mr. Obama should wait until a clear winner emerges in Iran and calls instead for ''treating the Iranian state as a unitary actor rather than endeavoring to play its contending factions against one another.'' The report also calls on him to back Israeli peace talks with Syria.
 In calling on Monday for a ''new dawn of American leadership,'' Mr. Obama assembled leaders with whom he had disagreed on fundamental issues. During the campaign, he repeatedly cited his early opposition to the Iraq war, but in Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Gates, he tapped two figures who supported the 2003 invasion before turning more skeptical of the war.
 Mr. Obama said he wanted ''strong personalities and strong opinions'' to foster robust discussion. ''One of the dangers in the White House, based on my reading of history, is that you get wrapped up in groupthink and everybody agrees with everything and there's no discussion and there are no dissenting views,'' he said. ''So I'm going to be welcoming a vigorous debate inside the White House.'' But he added: ''As Harry Truman said, the buck will stop with me.''
 The Republican National Committee issued a compendium of campaign statements in which Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had criticized each other on foreign policy. The Republican group asked ''whether Senator Clinton still carries those same, real concerns about President-elect Obama and his stances on critical issues confronting the nation.''
 From the another point of the political spectrum, Christopher Preble, the foreign policy director from the Cato Institute, a libertarian organization, criticized Mr. Obama for tapping people who once supported the Iraq war. The lineup, Mr. Preble said, ''suggests that we will only get more of the same.''

HEADLINE: A Premier With a Hand in TV News Sues His Journalist Critics

BYLINE: By RACHEL DONADIO

DATELINE: ROME 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi governs with a solid majority, oversees RAI, the state broadcaster, and owns the country's leading private television networks. 
 So why, with all those means at his disposal, does the prime minister continue to respond to his journalist critics not on television or in the press but instead with lawsuits?
 In recent years, Mr. Berlusconi has sued the magazine The Economist for writing that he was not ''fit to run Italy'' and the British journalist David Lane for his 2004 book, ''Berlusconi's Shadow,'' which explored the origins of his fortune and noted that some of his associates had been investigated for Mafia ties. Mr. Berlusconi lost those cases in lower court and either has appealed them or still has the possibility of doing so. 
 Now, he has set his sights on Alexander Stille, America's best-known Italianist and one of the prime minister's most vocal Anglophone critics. A lower court in Milan is expected to rule on Tuesday in a defamation case filed against Mr. Stille by a close associate of Mr. Berlusconi. 
 Mr. Berlusconi is not alone in suing reporters. In Italy -- where journalists often play fast and loose with the facts and the legal system is devised to protect personal honor -- politicians, magistrates and public figures sue journalists so often that the Italian National Press Federation has a ''solidarity fund'' to help with legal fees and damages.
 ''It's one of the intimidation techniques of the political class,'' said Franco Abruzzo, a journalism professor and a former editor of the financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore. 
 And something of a bipartisan sport as well. In 1999, Massimo d'Alema, a former Communist who was then a center-left prime minister, sued a political cartoonist for a drawing that showed him whiting out names in the Mitrokhin Report on Western cooperation with the Soviets during the cold war.
 Yet, when the plaintiff is Mr. Berlusconi, the situation inevitably takes on other dimensions. 
 ''What makes it different is that he's the most powerful politician and richest man,'' said Mr. Lane, the Rome correspondent of The Economist and a target of Mr. Berlusconi's lawsuits. ''He controls the media. He's working from a position of maximum strength.''
 Indeed, some see such lawsuits as part of a more troubling pattern in which Mr. Berlusconi tries to intimidate the press -- even as he claims that the same news media organizations he largely controls are out to get him. 
 In 2002, Mr. Berlusconi criticized three left-wing critics -- the comedian Daniele Luttazzi, the talk-show host Michele Santoro and the journalist Enzo Biagi -- from RAI, which soon canceled their programs. (Mr. Luttazzi and Mr. Santoro eventually returned to television, and Mr. Biagi died last year.) 
 Today, Italy's answer to Tina Fey, Sabina Guzzanti, famous for imitating members of the government, and Beppe Grillo, a Michael Moore-style provocateur, are given little airtime on television, albeit for complicated reasons, in spite of their large populist followings. Yet a leading send-up show, ''Striscia la Notizia,'' routinely mocks those in power and is shown on Mr. Berlusconi's Mediaset network. In the case to be heard Tuesday in Milan, Fedele Confalonieri, the chairman of Mediaset, is suing over several passages in Mr. Stille's 2006 book on the rise of Mr. Berlusconi, ''The Sack of Rome.''
 Mr. Confalonieri objected to Mr. Stille's having reported that he was investigated in 1993 for illegal financing of the Socialist Party, without also noting that he was later cleared of those charges. 
 He found fault with Mr. Stille's assertion that Mr. Berlusconi ''has fused his business and private life almost totally,'' as evidenced by his appointing Mr. Confalonieri, ''his oldest childhood friend,'' to run Mediaset. 
 And he objected to Mr. Stille's quoting someone who said that many of Mr. Berlusconi's close associates based their friendships ''on blackmail'' because they were the ones who knew where ''all the skeletons in the closet are hidden.'' 
 Although the assertions were not new and had been reported in the Italian press, Mr. Confalonieri maintained in his suit that they ''directly damage the honorability and the reputation'' of the parties in question. Mr. Confalonieri and Mediaset are seeking undisclosed damages. 
 A lawyer for Mr. Confalonieri, Vittorio Virga, said other journalists had avoided lawsuits by publishing retractions saying they now considered Mr. Confalonieri ''a gentleman.'' 
 ''We shook hands and 'arrivederci,' '' Mr. Virga said. But Mr. Stille, he added, ''didn't show any initiative toward making peace.''
 For his part, Mr. Stille, a professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and the author of several well-regarded books on Italy, said that being sued for printing facts was ''a Kafkaesque experience.''
 ''If they had been sincerely interested in setting the record straight and establishing the truth, they had many simpler ways,'' Mr. Stille said. 
 Mr. Berlusconi's lawyer, Nicolo Ghedini, said Italian newspapers rarely punished erring journalists so public figures had to defend their names in court. He added, ''How come a journalist should have the right to defame?'' 
 Under Italian law, even printing that someone has been investigated can be tantamount to defamation. Yet defamation suits are difficult to win, and public officials are usually on the short end. 
 But Mr. Stille and others contend that the point is not to win a judgment as much as to intimidate journalists and news outlets with the prospect of a lengthy and expensive court proceeding if they write something unfavorable. ''For each of these suits, you may affect the behavior of another 100 journalists,'' Mr. Stille added.
 Such litigation seems to have an effect. 
 Mr. Lane, of The Economist, said he was considering cutting all references to Mr. Berlusconi in the Italian -- but not the British -- edition of his forthcoming book on the Mafia. ''I'm too tired of spending my own money,'' he said. ''There are no medals to be won by being sued by Berlusconi.''

HEADLINE: Recession Began Last December, Economists Say

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The United States economy officially sank into a recession last December, which means that the downturn is already longer than the average for all recessions since World War II, according to the committee of economists responsible for dating the nation's business cycles. 
 In declaring that the economy has been in a downturn for almost 12 months, the National Bureau of Economic Research confirmed what many Americans had already been feeling in their bones.
 But private forecasters warned that this downturn was likely to set a new postwar record for length and likely to be more painful than any recession since 1980 and 1981. 
 ''We will rewrite the record book on length for this recession,'' said Allen Sinai, president of Decision Economics in Lexington, Mass. ''It's still arguable whether it will set a new record on depth. I hope not, but we don't know.'' 
 As if adding a grim punctuation mark to what could become the worst holiday shopping season in decades, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged nearly 680 points, or 7.7 percent, to 8,149.09. 
 Part of the drop may have reflected profit-taking after last week's surge in stock prices, but it also came in response to new data showing that manufacturing activity dropped to its lowest point in 26 years.
 Both the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, and the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., vowed to use all the tools at their disposal to restore a measure of normalcy to the economy.
 Mr. Bernanke, speaking to business leaders in Austin, Tex., said it was ''certainly feasible'' to reduce the Fed's benchmark overnight lending rate below its current target of 1 percent, signaling that the central bank would lower the rate at its next policy meeting in two weeks. 
 And in an unusually explicit follow-up, Mr. Bernanke said the central bank was also prepared to use the ''second arrow in our quiver'' if policy makers have already reduced that rate, called the federal funds rate, to nearly zero. 
 Among the options, he said, the Fed can start aggressively buying up longer-term Treasury securities. That would have the effect of driving down longer-term interest rates. The Fed is already doing something of that sort, by buying up commercial debt from private companies as well as mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 Investors reacted to Mr. Bernanke's remarks by pouring money into longer-term Treasury bonds, which briefly pushed already-low yields on 10-year and 30-year Treasuries to new record lows. Investors appeared to be reacting mainly to the clear signal from Mr. Bernanke that the Fed was preparing to pump money into the economy by buying up longer-term bonds.
 The yield on 30-year Treasuries declined 0.23 percentage points, to 3.21 percent, and briefly touched a record low of 3.18 percent. The yield on 10-year Treasuries fell 0.19 percentage points, to 2.73 percent.
 In normal times, those kinds of yields would automatically mean lower interest rates on mortgages, automobile loans and other forms of consumer debt. But the credit markets have been stalled by continued fears among financial institutions about who can be trusted for even short-term transactions, so the effects on home loans and other purposes could remain modest. 
 Mr. Paulson, in a speech in Washington on Monday, vowed to look at new ways to use the $700 billion bailout fund that Congress approved in October.
 In Congress, Democratic leaders are drawing up a huge new fiscal stimulus plan that could total more than $500 billion. Democrats said they planned to have the measure ready as soon as Congress convened with a strengthened Democratic majority in January. Meanwhile, Democrats could take up legislation next week that would provide financial assistance to the automobile industry. 
 President Bush, increasingly the odd man out in the last weeks of his term, said his administration would do whatever was necessary to safeguard the system.
 ''I'm sorry it's happening, of course,'' Mr. Bush said in an interview with ABC's ''World News'' on Monday. ''Obviously, I don't like the idea of Americans losing their jobs or being worried about their 401(k)s. On the other hand, the American people got to know that we will safeguard the system.'' 
 But many analysts said they saw no signs yet that the economy was nearing a bottom. American consumers, who for decades have been the country's tireless source of growth when all else failed, have cut back on their spending more sharply than at any time since the early 1980s. 
 Consumer spending plunged in the third quarter of this year, and the evidence so far suggests they may pull back even more in the fourth quarter. Consumers account for about 71 percent of American economic activity, and their most recent retreat is occurring even though gasoline prices have dropped by almost half in the last month and left people with more money in their pockets. 
 In officially declaring that the current recession began in December 2007, the National Bureau of Economic Research paid little heed to the fact that the nation's gross domestic product actually expanded slightly in the first and second quarters of 2008.
 In explaining its decision, the bureau noted that a wide variety of other indicators, including payroll employment and personal income, peaked in December 2007. Payroll employment has dropped every month since then. Personal income declined and then zigzagged until June, and has declined steadily since then.
 The gross domestic product often fluctuates widely from quarter to quarter, but it also received a somewhat artificial boost from the tax rebate checks that the government mailed out last spring and early summer as a temporary stimulus.
 Ed McKelvey, an economist at Goldman Sachs, said the bureau's starting point of last December for the recession was close to Goldman's own estimates. 
 The announcement means that the downturn is already one year old. That is longer than the average length of 10.5 months for recessions since World War II. The current record for the longest recession over the last half-century is 16 months, which was reached in both the downturns of 1973-74 and 1980-81. 
 Mr. Sinai of Decision Economics said it was hard to imagine that this downturn would have hit bottom within the next four months, which would make it all but certain to set a new record.
 Mr. Paulson, who teamed up with the Fed last week to begin a new $200 billion program to buy up consumer debt and small-business loans, said he had committed all but about $20 billion of the first $350 billion Congress authorized for the bailout fund. 
 ''We are actively engaged in developing additional programs to strengthen our financial system so that lending flows to our economy,'' Mr. Paulson said in his speech. ''We are continuing to examine potential foreclosure mitigation ideas that may be an appropriate'' use of the funds.
 Democratic lawmakers have sharply criticized Mr. Paulson for refusing to use any of the money yet for reducing foreclosures. Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, warned last month that as many as 4.5 million people were likely to lose their homes through foreclosure. Ms. Bair proposed a plan that she said could prevent about one-third of those foreclosures.

HEADLINE: Bailout Monitor Sees Lack of a Coherent Plan

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
The head of a new Congressional panel set up to monitor the gigantic federal bailout says the government still does not seem to have a coherent strategy for easing the financial crisis, despite the billions it has already spent in that effort.
 Elizabeth Warren, the chairwoman of the oversight panel, said in an interview Monday that the government instead seemed to be lurching from one tactic to the next without clarifying how each step fits into an overall plan. 
 ''You can't just say, 'Credit isn't moving through the system,' '' she said in her first public comments since being named to the panel. ''You have to ask why.''
 If the answer is that banks do not have money to lend, it would make sense to push capital into their hands, as the Treasury has been doing over the last two months, she continued. But if the answer is that their potential borrowers are getting less creditworthy with each passing day, ''pouring money into banks isn't going to fix that problem,'' she said. 
 The new panel has held only a few briefings with Treasury officials so far, and Ms. Warren acknowledged that she and the other panel members were still in the early stages of their research.
 Treasury Department officials have never described their actions as the sole remedy. A spokesman noted that Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. recently testified that stabilizing the financial system was a necessary first step in any plan to address the financial and economic crisis.
 ''Our objectives in asking Congress for a financial rescue package were to first stabilize a financial system on the verge of collapse, and then to get lending going again to support the American people and businesses,'' Mr. Paulson said at one recent hearing. ''If the financial system were to collapse, it would significantly worsen and prolong the economic downturn.''
 A Harvard law school professor and a consumer bankruptcy expert, Ms. Warren was named by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to the new five-member panel, created as part of the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, enacted in October. She was elected chairwoman at the group's first meeting last Wednesday.
 In that role, she will have a strong voice in shaping the mission of the panel and the content of the regular reports it will deliver to Congress as long as the TARP exists.
 The panel's power, as sketched out in the law, extends a bit beyond the ''bully pulpit'' but falls far short of a veto over specific proposals or programs. Its main source of influence is that it will have the ear of lawmakers who can tighten the bailout purse-strings or rewrite its charter.
 ''Good ideas produce their own power,'' Ms. Warren said. ''If we have good ideas, it will be a powerful series of reports. If we don't, it won't.''
 Like much of the public, lawmakers ''have just been stunned by these economic and financial developments,'' she said. ''There wasn't time even to develop a coherent list of questions to ask Treasury about what it's doing and what it plans to do -- and whether either of those are likely to address what's going wrong.''
 She added: ''Our role is to make sure that the right questions are asked as early as possible.''
 In that spirit, she promised that Congress would get the panel's first report on Dec. 10, ''laying out the central questions that Treasury should be addressing as it spends the taxpayers' money.''
 Meetings with Treasury officials so far have made her question whether they understand that ''household financial health is profoundly tied to the economic health of the nation,'' she said. ''You cannot repair this economy if you can't repair those families, and I'm not sure the people directing the bailout see that as their job.''
 In her view, the government should be trying to create more reliable customers for those banks by shoring up the fragile finances of the millions of American families that could not save, borrow or spend even if their banks were flush with capital.
 ''Any effective policy has to start with the households,'' she said. ''Years of flat wages, low savings and high debt have left America's households extremely vulnerable.''
 Ms. Warren, on the law faculty at Harvard since 1995, has written extensively and testified frequently before Congress on consumer credit laws and personal bankruptcy reform. She has been a member of several government advisory panels addressing consumer finance issues, and is the co-author of ''The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers & Fathers Are Going Broke'' (Basic Books, 2003).
 Ms. Warren will also be responsible for getting the panel up and running quickly and steering it around the two other monitors put in place by the legislation: the General Accountability Office, whose first report on the bailout is due Tuesday, and a special inspector general who is not yet on the job. (Neil M. Barofsky, a veteran federal prosecutor in Manhattan, has been nominated by the White House but is still awaiting Senate confirmation.)
 The specific bailout investments, transactions and employment decisions need to be monitored closely to make sure they are appropriate and ethical, she said. ''But we need to draw a distinction between policy oversight and procedural oversight,'' she added. ''I see our role as lying more in the policy realm, so I don't think we duplicate those efforts.''
 The panel is also required by law to provide Congress with recommendations for reforms to the financial regulatory structure, a report that she said it would deliver by Jan. 20.
 Despite Ms. Warren's ambitious timetable, the new Congressional panel is having a bumpy start.
 Created with the law's passage on Oct. 3, it existed only in theory until Nov. 14, when its first three members were appointed by the Democratic leadership in Congress. Besides Ms. Warren, they are Damon Silvers, an associate general counsel of the AFL-CIO and the panel's new deputy chairman, and Richard H. Neiman, the state superintendent of banks for New York. 
 On Nov. 19, the Republican leaders in the House and Senate selected Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas and Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire to fill out the panel.
 But on Monday, Senator Gregg, who is also the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, announced that he ''will need to step aside from this effort.'' He cited the legislative burden facing the Senate, specifically ''an extremely large stimulus package'' and ''the ongoing issues of developing fiscal policy relative to the budget.''
 Aides to Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, said his office expected to announce a successor soon.
 Ms. Warren said she regretted his absence but still expected the panel to meet its deadlines.

HEADLINE: Putting A Value On a C.E.O.

 BODY:
Wall Street often portrays itself as a pay-for-performance meritocracy. The rules are supposed to be simple: Make money, and you get rich. Lose it, and you get fired.
 What, then, should Citigroup pay Vikram S. Pandit, its embattled chief executive? On his watch, Citigroup, hobbled by bad investments, grabbed not one but two financial lifelines from the government. Its share price plummeted about 80 percent. (In fairness, he took the reins of the firm less than a year ago.) 
 Many Americans, including many people on Wall Street, would argue that an executive with a record like that should get paid little or nothing. Usually, the public wouldn't have much of a say. But now the Treasury Department has to approve Citigroup's compensation program. Under the latest rescue plan, Citigroup is supposed to devise a pay plan that ''that rewards long-term performance and profitability, with appropriate limitations.'' 
 You, fellow taxpayer, are now an investor in Citigroup and other major banks. Whether you like it or not, you have a vested interest in Citigroup's success. If this giant falls, we all lose.
 So how exactly can we link pay and ''long-term performance'' (the same long-term performance that we taxpayers will require since it's unlikely we'll be able to sell our stake anytime soon)? 
 In a speech on Friday, Citigroup's chairman, Winfried F. W. Bischoff, said the financial giant was considering its options. He said he was unconvinced, however, that simply limiting pay and including more stock and longer-term rewards was the right solution. 
 ''By itself, more share and retention-based compensation is not the magic bullet, because it certainly didn't stop us from running up very large losses,'' Mr. Bischoff said. 
 True enough. But many people argue that Wall Street's approach to compensation helped get us in this mess to begin with. Bankers were rewarded for taking risks that they clearly failed to manage. So something has to change. 
 The trick, of course, is to dole out enough rewards to keep executives working, and working hard, but not to dole out too much. By most standards, Mr. Pandit is rich already: he made $800 million by selling his hedge fund to Citigroup (he later shuttered it).
 Citigroup and other firms need to find ways to keep and attract talented people who can make smart decisions, without lavishing pay on them or rewarding them for shoddy performance.
 ''What has caused the most outrage is the difference between pay and actual performance,'' said Lucian Bebchuk, the director of the program on corporate governance at Harvard Law School. Mr. Bebchuk says he doesn't prescribe limiting compensation; he's fine with outsize pay as long as it matches outsize performance.
 But will taxpayers and the government really accept a $50 million, or even a $10 million, pay package for someone like Mr. Pandit if he were to right Citigroup's ship?
 Sarah Anderson, a director at the Institute for Policy Studies, is an advocate of aggressive pay curbs and isn't likely to buy into an eight-figure income, no matter what the performance.
 ''I want taxpayers to feel confident that an unreasonable amount of money isn't ending up in their pockets,'' Ms. Anderson said of the executives. ''This may be the time to inject some sanity into the pay system.'' 
 That may be so. But Mr. Pandit and others -- to the extent you believe they are the right leaders of Citigroup -- or whoever takes their roles are unlikely to hang around if they're not amply paid.
 Top executives at Goldman Sachs have already announced that they will forgo bonuses this year -- a move welcomed by Andrew M. Cuomo, the attorney general of New York.
 Alan Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting practice based in New York, said he thought it would be wise for Mr. Pandit to follow suit. 
 ''If I'm in Kansas and losing my house, I think it's madness to pay them a big bonus,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''Vikram has to take one for the team this year.''
 Mr. Johnson said no one should expect Mr. Pandit to take a big hit two years in a row, however. 
 The tougher questions will come next year when the economy is expected to be in even worse shape, it may be even less politically palatable for Wall Street executives to get bigger compensation packages when the rest of the world might seem worse off.
 Still, Mr. Johnson said, ''In early 2009, the board should set up a long-term incentive system.'' He added: ''I wouldn't care if it's politically incorrect. And I'd give him a lot of stock.''
 But the risk, Mr. Johnson said, is that if we taxpayers don't offer the possibility of a payday, we won't get the performance. ''If you were in senior management and you knew you'd never get paid, you're not going to work as hard or you'll leave,'' he said. ''It's actually worse if they stay. If you have a bunch of demoralized people hanging around, it will kill you.''
 But that may not be the answer, either. One thing this whole financial crisis has demonstrated is that Wall Street's old pay systems failed. Giving executives a lot of stock did not prevent the disaster. Worse, many executives cashed out before things went bad. 
 So here's another idea that might prompt executives to keep a closer eye on the risks that their bankers and traders take: have executives invest in their own firms on the same terms as we taxpayers. And for good measure, have them invest in the financial products that their companies sell. If executives had put their own money into the tricky mortgage investments that their banks were selling, they might have asked hard questions from the start.

HEADLINE: Linda Darling-Hammond

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

 BODY:
As he prepares to take office, President-elect Barack Obama is relying on a small team of advisers who will lead his transition operation and help choose the members of his administration. Following is part of a series of profiles of potential members of the administration. 
 Name:Linda Darling-Hammond
 Being considered for: Education secretary
 Would bring to the job: A 30-year career as an education professor, currently at Stanford, and as a social scientist. She is an authority on school reform, educational equity and teacher quality, the latter because she directed the work of a national blue ribbon panel on teaching and founded a charter school that specializes in teacher training. She has encouraged the work of teacher training academies in Chicago and elsewhere.
 Is linked to Mr. Obama by: Helped draft his ambitious educational program, especially the parts that call for recruiting and training thousands of new teachers each year. She shares the president-elect's respect for the role played by excellent teachers in raising student achievement and was one of two experts who appeared repeatedly as surrogates for him in debates with Senator John McCain's top education adviser during the campaign. She now heads the Obama transition team's working group on education policy.
 In her own words:''Lagging far behind our international peers in educational outcomes -- and with one of the most unequal educational systems in the industrialized world -- we need, I believe, something much more than and much different from what No Child Left Behind offers. We badly need a national policy that enables schools to meet the intellectual demands of the 21st century.'' (The Nation, May 2, 2007) 
 Used to work as: Before moving to Stanford in 1998, she taught for a decade at Teachers College at Columbia University. She spent the 1980's in Washington as a social scientist at the RAND corporation. Before and after graduating from college, she taught in various classrooms and spent a year teaching high school English in Media, Pa.
 Carries as baggage: She signed a manifesto this year calling for greatly increased federal spending on poor schools and students, which put her at odds with signers of a competing one that said the nation's priority should be to squeeze teachers unions and administrators harder to raise minority achievement. She is a longtime critic of Teach for America because many of its corps members abandon the classroom just when they are learning their jobs, but she has recently acknowledged that the program recruited new talent into teaching.
 Is otherwise known for: Biking to work on the Stanford campus and playing piano. She says she is waiting for Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to return to campus so the two can pick up on a mutual promise to do some two-piano work together.
 Biography: Born Dec. 21, 1951, in Cleveland ... graduated magna cum laude from Yale, and earned her education doctorate from Temple University ... eight universities have awarded her honorary degrees.

HEADLINE: An Offer To Ensure The Right To Insurance

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
For these economically uncertain times, the UnitedHealth Group has a ''first of its kind'' product: the right to buy an individual health policy at some point in the future even if you become sick. 
 Called UnitedHealth Continuity, the product is not actual medical insurance, but is aimed at people who may have insurance now but are worried they may lose it -- and may not be able to obtain replacement insurance on their own. They may expect to retire early, for example, before they qualify for Medicare. Or they are worried about the possibility of losing their job and their health coverage. 
 People who are already sick will generally not be eligible for the new product. Those who do pass a medical review, will pay 20 percent each month of the current premium on an individual policy to reserve the right to be insured under the plan at some point in the future. 
 ''What this product is designed to do, for a very modest premium, is to essentially protect your insurability for the future,'' said Richard A. Collins, the president of UnitedHealth's individual insurance unit, who says he is the first policy holder. His monthly fee is $50.
 Some health policy experts question whether UnitedHealth Continuity is a good way for consumers to spend their money. They acknowledge that people who are forced to buy insurance on their own face a daunting task. If they are not healthy, such people may find any available coverage too expensive. And most states let insurers refuse to sell new individual policies to anyone with a pre-existing medical condition. 
 But if changes to the health insurance system do occur under the Obama administration, they say, UnitedHealth's new product may become obsolete. 
 ''As an individual, you're betting against health reform,'' said Peter V. Lee, the executive director of national health policy for the Pacific Business Group on Health, a California group of employers who provide health coverage for their workers. 
 Mr. Lee notes that there is serious talk in Washington of having private insurers agree to offer individual coverage to anyone, regardless of their health status. People who choose to pay for the UnitedHealth guarantee could find that the insurance industry will eventually be providing the same thing free. 
 ''It's an attempt to have a market solution to a market failure,'' Mr. Lee said.
 Mr. Collins says he is unconcerned about the possibility of health reform, given the uncertainties surrounding any government efforts. ''Until something happens, this is a really good tool,'' he said. UnitedHealth, which announced the UnitedHealth Continuity product Tuesday at an investors' conference in New York, plans to begin promoting it in coming weeks. 
 It is initially available in 25 of the 40 states where UnitedHealth currently sells individual insurance, which do not include New York and New Jersey. The company is applying to sell it in the other 15 states, including Connecticut, where it now sells to individuals. The monthly fees for reserving the right to UnitedHealth's insurance will vary, depending on people's age and sex, where they live and how generous a coverage plan they select. 
 A 50-year-old male in Columbus, Ohio, who planned to eventually take an individual policy in which he would be obliged to pay the first $3,500 in medical bills would pay $32 a month for the right to eventually get that coverage -- or 20 percent of a policy that now costs $159 a month. 
 But it is uncertain exactly how he much he could end up paying for the guarantee, or for the medical coverage itself in the future. The premiums, and the monthly fees, are likely to increase over time. 
 And people attracted to the new product could eventually develop costly medical ailments, experts say, so enrollees might eventually have to pay higher premiums than people able to join plans open only to the healthy. But UnitedHealth says that the upfront monthly fees it collects could help defray some of those higher medical expenses down the road, if they do occur. 
 People who lose their employer-provided coverage do have other options. Under the federal Cobra law, they can continue their employer-based coverage for a time after losing or leaving their jobs. And some states have insurance programs available even for those who are at risk of incurring high medical bills. 
 Private insurers are increasingly interested in coming up with new plans that offer coverage even to those individuals with pre-existing conditions, said Bob Vineyard, an insurance broker in Atlanta. He said he expected such plans to be introduced next year. 
 There are people for whom the new UnitedHealth Continuity product will make sense, Mr. Vineyard said, like someone who expects to work on contract for employers that offer health benefits but who anticipates gaps in that coverage. 
 But Mr. Vineyard said he did not expect the Continuity plan to have widespread appeal. Many people, he said, especially those who are already struggling in the current economy, may not want to spend the money for the coverage. ''I think it's got very, very limited application,'' he said.
 Some financial planners are also lukewarm to the idea of spending extra money for a guarantee. Neil Brown, a financial planner for Burkett Financial Services in West Columbia, S.C., compared such a purchase to sleeping with a life preserver for fear of drowning. Some advocates for changing the health insurance system say that rather than expecting individuals to spend hundreds of dollars a year for a guarantee they may not need, the government should do more to make sure everyone has access to coverage. 
 ''This product is taking advantage of the lack of sensible health reform that could easily solve this problem,'' said Ron Pollack, the executive director of Families USA, a consumer advocacy group in Washington. 
 But Mr. Collins of UnitedHealth argues that Continuity is a way for consumers to make sure they can obtain medical insurance that may be better than anything the government comes up with. 
 ''I think it's a terrific hedge,'' he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 5, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about an offer by UnitedHealth Group to guarantee to some customers the right to buy an individual health policy in the future regardless of their health status incorrectly included New Jersey and New York, in some copies, among the states in which the offer is available or could be made available. Because UnitedHealth does not sell individual policies in either state, it will not make the offer.

HEADLINE: Detroit's Liabilities: Two Professors' View

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''If Bankruptcy Hits Detroit'' (editorial, Nov. 22):
 Citing our statistics, you argue that General Motors' pension situation makes bankruptcy less palatable than new government loans, as taxpayers could face $23 billion in unfunded pension liabilities. While the figure you report is correct, we disagree with your reasoning. 
 A loan would not save the government $23 billion. It would still be responsible for the funding gap in a future bankruptcy that remains very likely, even with additional loans. Bankruptcy today would simply transform an off-balance-sheet government liability into an on-balance-sheet one. 
 Delaying bankruptcy would also expose the government to greater risk. G.M.'s pension fund could recover, or it could deteriorate even more. But since G.M. is never going to go bankrupt with a pension surplus, the government faces a lot more downside than upside. 
 Delaying bankruptcy in the hope that the pension assets will recover would be a classic case of gambling for resurrection.
 Hiding liabilities off the balance sheet and gambling for resurrection are among the primary causes of the current financial crisis. This is not the time to suggest that the government follow suit.
 Joshua Rauh Luigi Zingales Chicago, Nov. 24, 2008
 The writers are, respectively, an associate professor of finance and a professor of entrepreneurship and finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business.

HEADLINE: A Waterfront Revival in the Midwest

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: COLUMBUS, Ohio 

 BODY:
A decade ago, a 75-acre area along the Scioto River less than a mile west of this capital city's downtown was an industrial no man's land, consisting of barren railyards, old warehouses and a shuttered 19th-century penitentiary. But that was before Nationwide Realty Investors, an affiliate of Nationwide Mutual Insurance, turned the area into the Arena District. 
 The district, a $750 million mixed-use neighborhood of housing, offices, retailing and entertainment, has attracted some of the city's most prominent architecture, law, real estate development and advertising firms and is regarded as one of the Midwest's most successful urban redevelopment projects. 
 Late in October, the Columbus City Council approved the development plan for the Arena District's final phase: a $250 million project to add 450 units of housing, 300,000 square feet of office space in two buildings, an 80,000-square-foot grocery store, an eight-level garage with 1,600 spaces and as much as 40,000 square feet of retail space. 
 As for the financial crisis that has gripped the credit markets, Brian J. Ellis, the president and chief operating officer of Nationwide Realty Investors, noted that in the 11-year history of the Arena District's development, the company had contended with what he called ''down cycles.'' Though the current crisis is more severe than the others, Mr. Ellis said, the company's strategy is to ''build with the market.''
 ''What's happening now may affect the speed at which we complete this final phase,'' he said in an interview. ''But we continue to see strong demand for the office space and housing. We continue to command the highest rental rates in the city.''
 Indeed, at annual leasing prices of roughly $25 a square foot -- compared with about $20 downtown -- 97 percent of the 1.4 million square feet of office space is occupied in the Arena District's three- and four-story brick buildings.
 Their design pays homage to the old warehouses and factories that once stood here. They now house some 5,000 workers, including more than 100 employees of SBC Advertising, a top Midwest firm, which leased 30,000 square feet at 333 West Nationwide Boulevard, the district's newest office building. 
 About 1,000 people live in the 525 housing units in the Arena District, and much of it is leased or sold. This includes North Bank Park, a 20-story condominium building along the river with striking views of downtown, which Nationwide completed in December 2007. The two-bedroom two-bath units sell for $350,000 to $1 million, and nearly 50 percent of 88 units have been sold. 
 Thousands of people from outside the area regularly attend games of the Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League in the 18,500-seat Nationwide Arena, which was the catalyst for this redevelopment, and they spend time before and after the hockey games and other events in 14 restaurants and bars in the district.
 The area also includes the handsome and welcoming McFerson Commons, a pocket park that connects to the Scioto Mile, a $39 million promenade and riverfront park that the city started to build this year. 
 Nationwide is also developing Huntington Park, the new 10,000-seat baseball field for the Columbus Clippers, a Triple-A franchise of the Cleveland Indians. The $50 million stadium, which covers eight acres, is owned by Franklin County and is to open next spring. 
 ''The district has become an experience,'' Mr. Ellis said. ''As each piece of the project is put in place, the experience of living in an urban neighborhood or working here or playing here improves.''
 Such a view is a departure from the strategic vision that Columbus, and many other major Midwestern cities, embraced for much of the last half century. Though it is Ohio's largest city, with nearly 750,000 residents, Columbus's growth long came through suburban development and annexation. The city is now spread across 225.9 square miles, almost six times its 39.9-square-mile jurisdiction in 1950. 
 Columbus was so bent on pursuing suburban-type development that it supported highway construction that sped people out of downtown to the suburbs and scraped away historic buildings for parking. In 1989, it opened a windowless mall in the heart of downtown. 
 That approach proved disastrous. Even now, much of downtown is empty at night. High Street, once the city's retail and business spine, has 152,000 square feet of vacant office space and 12 acres of vacant lots and parking, according to the city. In October, the city began demolishing an overhead walkway to the City Center Mall, which the city now controls and where just 10 of 100 original stores are still in business. 
 Nationwide Realty helped Columbus envision a new approach to land use. The Arena District, a partnership between the city and the company, which has developed almost everything in the decade-old district, was to be an answer to Columbus's downtown woes, and it seems to be succeeding.
 The mixed-use district embodies three influential theories of urban redevelopment of the last decade: energetic and walkable street and neighborhood designs, as advocated by prominent architects who call themselves ''new urbanists''; urban settings that let creative young professionals weave work and play, as advanced in the writing of Richard Florida; and sports venues, which some experts see as essential to civic economic health. 
 The Arena District's popularity has prompted Mayor Michael B. Coleman to accelerate a plan for the city's depopulated downtown that he introduced in 2002. Four years after it closed as a historic department store, the one-million-square-foot Lazarus building reopened in 2007 as an office building. 
 Nearly 2,000 people work there, and it has spurred housing development. About 4,700 people have moved downtown into almost 4,000 units of housing built since 2000, and 1,000 more units have been approved for construction. 
 Mayor Coleman said his target was to attract 10,000 people to live downtown, and in March he committed to spend $20 million to develop 86 miles of bike paths and lanes, with both to be completed by 2012. ''Let's take advantage of our flat city,'' he told a group of supporters earlier this year. ''Flat is good.''
 The 54-year-old mayor has also started planning a new streetcar line that would tie downtown to the Ohio State University campus, to the Arena District and other parts of Columbus. ''Downtown is the engine that drives our economy and the epicenter of life as we know it in central Ohio,'' Mr. Coleman said. ''We are making progress.''
 Since 2000, according to the Columbus Downtown Development Corporation, $2.2 billion has been invested in commercial, office and residential development in and around the city's core. More than a third was spent in the Arena District. ''Our idea was to make this a 24-hour neighborhood,'' Mr. Ellis said. ''And that's what it's become.''

HEADLINE: Hawaii Backs Plan for a Network of Electric Cars

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
The State of Hawaii and the Hawaiian Electric Company on Tuesday endorsed an effort to build an alternative transportation system based on electric vehicles with swappable batteries and an ''intelligent'' battery recharging network.
 The plan, the brainchild of the former Silicon Valley software executive Shai Agassi, is an effort to overcome the major hurdles to electric cars -- slow battery recharging and limited availability. 
 By using existing electric car technologies, coupled with an Internet-connected web of tens of thousands of recharging stations, he thinks his company, Better Place L.L.C. of Palo Alto, Calif., will make all-electric vehicles feasible. 
 Mr. Agassi has succeeded in assembling a growing consortium of national governments, regional planning organizations and one major car company. Tuesday's announcement follows earlier endorsements from Israel, Denmark, Australia, Renault-Nissan and a coalition of Northern California localities supporting the idea leading to the deployment of an electric vehicle with a range of greater than 100 miles, beginning at the end of 2010 in Israel. The company plans test deployments of vehicles in 2009 and broad commercial sales in 2012. 
 Mr. Agassi has raised $200 million in private financing for his idea. In October, he obtained a commitment from the Macquarie Capital Group to raise an additional $1 billion for an Australian project. 
 On Tuesday, he said that he was optimistic about his project despite the dismal investment and credit markets because his network could provide investors with an annuity. Users of his recharging network would subscribe to the service, paying for access and for the miles they drive.
 Given the downturn in the mortgage market, he said that investors are looking for new classes of assets that will provide dependable revenue streams over many years. ''I believe the new asset class is batteries,'' he said. ''When you have a driver in a car using a battery, nobody is going to cut their subscription and stop driving.''
 Mr. Agassi has argued that even if oil prices continued to decline, his electric recharging network -- which ideally would use renewable energy sources like solar and wind -- could provide competitively priced energy for a new class of vehicles. 
 He supposes that his network idea will be appropriate first for ''island'' economies that typically have significantly higher energy costs, and then will become more cost-competitive as it is scaled up.
 ''We always knew Hawaii would be the perfect model,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''The typical driving plan is low and leisurely, and people are smiling.''
 Hawaii is a relatively small market with high energy costs. The state has about 1.2 million cars and replaces 70,000 to 120,000 vehicles annually. 
 Drivers on the islands also rarely make trips of more than 100 miles, meaning there will be less need for his proposed battery recharging stations. Part of Mr. Agassi's model depends on quick-change service stations to swap batteries for drivers who need to use their cars before they have completely recharged their batteries.
 Peter Rosegg, a spokesman for the Hawaiian Electric Company, said that Better Place would become a major customer for electricity and was also planning to invest in renewable energy sources that would be connected to the electric grid.
 ''It's going to be a nonexclusive agreement, but so far they're the only one that has shown up,'' Mr. Rosegg said.
 In late November, the mayors of San Francisco and other major Bay Area cities endorsed the Better Place network to help create an electric recharging network by 2012. The company estimates that it will cost $1 billion to build a charging network in the Bay Area that may create as many as half a million charging stations. 
 Despite challenges, the Better Place model is promising, said Daniel M. Kammen, a professor in the Energy and Resources Group at the University of California, Berkeley. It could appeal to owners of fleets of vehicles and to early adopter customers who are willing to work through the difficulties that will inevitably accompany a new transportation system. ''It has a lot of promising features,'' he said.

HEADLINE: China's Economy, in Need of Jump Start, Waits for Citizens' Fists to Loosen

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
He does not know it yet, but Dang Fu has been tapped to save the Chinese economy. 
 A ruddy-faced millet farmer from northeast China, Mr. Dang, 56, has managed to save two-thirds of his family's $2,200 annual income in recent years. He grows much of his own food, wears a winter coat until it is ready for the rag heap and buys niceties only when his wife's nagging becomes intolerable. 
 Last year's indulgence, a new 25-inch television, still makes him wince. ''It was painful to spend so much money,'' he said, strolling through the aisles of a supermarket last week with his prodigal sister-in-law (she saves just half of her salary).
 But such tenacious thrift, once an admirable quality here, has become a liability as the nation's export-driven economy slows, a prospect that has stoked the government's fear of unemployment and social instability, and that could threaten the Communist Party's hold on power. 
 In recent weeks China's once unstoppable economy has slowed sharply. Export growth, one of the main contributors to China's expansion over the past decade, has receded and seems likely to reduce overall growth next year, according to the World Bank. The stock market is in the doldrums and property values in many cities are off 30 to 40 percent. 
 China's annualized growth rate, which stood at 12 percent during the Olympics, has already slid to 9 percent, an admirable number by American standards but ominously close to the 8 percent figure that Chinese economists say is required to provide jobs to the 20 million people who enter the work force every year. On Monday, J.P. Morgan cut its fourth-quarter growth forecast for China to 7.7 percent, and other analysts predict that number could hit 5 percent next year.
 Government analysts are looking to consumers, especially the country's hundreds of millions of high-saving peasants, to pick up much of the slack. ''If we can boost people's confidence and they spend more money, it will not only be beneficial to China but it will help stabilize the world's economy,'' Zhu Guangyao, the assistant finance minister, said last week.
 But getting people to spend more, especially in the face of an economic slowdown, may be a tall order. Consumer spending makes up 35 percent of China's G.D.P., and that number has been dropping since the 1980s, when it stood at 50 percent; consumer activity in the United States, by contrast, is responsible for more than two-thirds of the economy. 
 Western economists suggest that to offset slumping exports and a slow-down in construction, Chinese consumers would have to increase their spending by a third. ''I'm not sure they're capable of doing that as quickly as the government would like,'' said Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University.
 Realistic or not, Beijing seems determined to give it a try. Although it is weighted toward bridge-building and highway-paving initiatives, the $586 billion stimulus package announced by the government last month includes a range of incentives intended to get Mr. Dang and his tightfisted brethren to unstuff their proverbial mattresses. 
 The measures include subsidized housing to persuade homebuyers to fill their new dwellings with furniture, and rural electrification projects that will give farmers access to affordable power. Last week China's central bank slashed interest rates by more than one percentage point. On Monday, the government introduced a subsidy in 14 provinces that would make it cheaper for people to buy cellphones, washing machines and flat-screen televisions. 
 Mr. Dang and his wife, Zhang Fengxia, 52, are the apotheosis of Chinese thrift. They do not use banks -- ''better to keep money at home,'' Ms. Zhang said -- and the couple's biggest expenditure was a used tractor they bought for $1,200 a few years ago. Everything else is set aside for their retirement and for potential medical costs. 
 Asked if she would use a credit card if one were given to her, Ms. Zhang looked confounded. ''What's a credit card?'' she asked, adding, ''We have everything we need.''
 .''
 Although high savings rates can be found across Asia, the Chinese propensity to save is rooted in deep-seated memories of scarcity and a tattered social safety net that forces people to save up for education, retirement and medical costs. The government has introduced a subsidized health care system in the countryside but most Chinese, rural and urban, live in fear of medical emergencies. 
 Doctors often raise their meager salaries by prescribing high-priced tests and medicines, and patients who cannot pay up front are regularly denied treatment. ''Health care is so expensive and distorted that no matter how much you save, if you get sick you're going to end up poor,'' said Wang Tao, a Beijing-based analyst at USB Securities. ''America's health care problems can't even compare.'' 
 In addition to health care reforms and reliable social security benefits for retirees, Ms. Wang and other analysts say the floodgates of personal consumption may have to await a marked rise in wages. ''That is something that will take years, not months,'' Ms. Wang said. For the moment, it is people like Li Xiuqing who hold the greatest promise for China's emerging consumer economy. A secretary in a Beijing accounting firm, Ms. Li, 28, makes less than $600 a month but she spends almost every yuan on stylish clothing, restaurant meals and prepaid minutes for her fuchsia-and-gold Nokia cellphone. 
 Raised on a hog farm in Hunan Province, she laughs off the penurious ways of her parents and grandparents. ''The most expensive thing my father ever bought was a wristwatch,'' she said as she picked up a $100 pair of stilettos at one of the capital's ubiquitous malls. ''China's days of starvation are over.'' 
 For the moment, however, the savers outnumber the spenders. On a recent afternoon, Li Xiaoyan, a 30-year-old public relations executive, was shopping with her mother at Carrefour, the French supermarket chain. 
 Ms. Li teased her mother about her miserly ways, pointing out that her last clothing purchase was a decade ago. Her mother, Xing Xiuqin, 60, bragged that she managed to stash away 80 percent of her income before retiring. ''Old people just need one outfit,'' she said. ''You should save everything for your kids.''
 Ms. Li said her generation lives more for the present. But asked how much she saves, she paused to calculate. About half her income, she said. ''I have to start saving for my child's college education,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Even in Home of Carmakers, Not Everyone Wants a Lifeline

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY and SUSAN SAULNY; Monica Davey reported from Kalamazoo, and Susan Saulny from Saugatuck, Mich.

DATELINE: KALAMAZOO, Mich. 

 BODY:
Wander Michigan's cities and towns, and many residents offer the same message about the prospect of a $34 billion bailout of America's automakers: Please provide the help, not just for the sake of the automobile industry and its workers but for all the other people whose jobs are so intricately braided into the state's autocentric economy.
 But the quiet truth in Michigan, home of the Big Three manufacturers, is that the state is not of one voice on the matter.
 Other opinions are alive, and they can be just as passionate in opposition to a rescue. This, even though neighbors or friends or parents may have once depended on the industry. This, though speaking for the bailout here is something akin to embracing the Great Lakes or apple pie, as evinced by the letter of support for it signed last month by all of Michigan's Congressional delegation, Democrats and Republicans alike. 
 There have been no statewide opinion polls published on the bailout request, though with Michigan's economy so tied to the industry, those for it undoubtedly outweigh those against, political, economic and polling experts suggest. Still, ''there are plenty of people who are rolling their eyes,'' said Bill Ballenger, editor of the closely followed newsletter Inside Michigan Politics.
 ''You keep your head down if you're one of them, but they're out there,'' Mr. Ballenger said. ''There are a lot of them.''
 In interviews across the state over the last two weeks, criticism of the automakers' request surfaced again and again. Many people said they had long watched Michigan's economy strain and falter -- in no few cases causing the collapse of their own employers and loss of their own jobs -- and could no longer see why the Big Three should be singled out for rescue.
 ''How many other, small companies would like a bailout?'' said Heather Davison, who lives in Davisburg, less than an hour north of Detroit, and has been unemployed for a year. ''It seems to me that the car companies saw the banks getting a bailout and said, 'Oh, let's go!' ''
 Ms. Davison, 34, lost her job as a graphic designer for a real estate publication when the company she worked for failed. She said General Motors, Ford and Chrysler should have made changes to their cars and work force years ago.
 ''They should have made a car that was more efficient,'' she said. ''And how many G.M. vehicles are there out there? They should have thought of this, of the need to restructure, a long time ago.'' 
 Like some others interviewed, Ms. Davison was unsparing as well in her criticism of the United Automobile Workers. ''I've watched that Ron Gettelfinger on TV,'' she said of the union's president. ''He talks about the need to restructure, but they needed to look at that a long time ago.''
 John Raterink, a tool and machine maker who works at a small shop in Grand Rapids that supplies parts to the auto industry, opposes a bailout even though his livelihood is tethered to the car makers. Mr. Raterink, 46, points a finger at the Big Three for a lot of economic misery. 
 ''I remember when G.M. shut down 11 plants, some of which were in the Great Lakes region,'' he said. ''They said, 'We can't afford to keep doing business like this.' But do you know what happened at the upper echelon of G.M.? They got six-figure bonuses at the end of the year. It's really hard to feel sorry for a company that's lived so high on the hog.''
 Mr. Raterink said he had seen dozens of machine shops like his disappear across western Michigan because of the outsourcing of work to other countries.
 ''If we look at thousands of workers in counties around here, they got no sympathy,'' he said. ''We got hurt, and we got hurt badly. As a result of their practices, I haven't seen a raise in six years, and I've seen my health benefits decline.''
 The Big Three's share of the market has dropped 30 percentage points in the last 13 years, to some 44 percent. That plunge has had a ripple effect across the state, home to more than half the people employed nationwide by the Big Three.
 Michigan can hardly afford it. The state's economy has been in recession for years, with some experts convinced that it never emerged from the last national recession, in 2001.
 The unemployment rate is 9.3 percent -- tied with Rhode Island's for the highest in the country -- and the safety net of social services is stretched beyond ability to care for all of those in need. The total of Michigan residents who receive some form of public assistance, like food stamps or home heating credits, is now 1.82 million, or close to 20 percent of the population, a record for the state.
 On top of all that, working people in Michigan are feeling the strain of higher taxes, a result of a state budget shortfall in 2007.
 But though the failure of any of the auto companies could make life in Michigan harder still, opponents of the rescue stand firm, many convinced that any federal loan would provide only a temporary fix anyway.
 ''Do I think things could get worse?'' Mr. Raterink said. ''Absolutely. But bear in mind that we've already been dealing with this since the last quarter of '99. If I have to pull myself up by my own bootstraps, I hope G.M. faces that same reality of pulling themselves up by their own bootstraps.''
 Jeffrey Kerr, a real estate developer who lives in the Lake Michigan town of Saugatuck, objects to the personal costs that he says come with bailouts. ''When the government starts bailing out private companies,'' Mr. Kerr said, ''what they're basically saying is, 'We're going to tax you more for a very long time.' ''
 Pat Weber, a construction manager who was laid off last year in Fennville, near Saugatuck, largely agreed. ''A bailout will cause a snowballing effect,'' Ms. Weber said, ''and it's way too scary how it will come back on all of us.'' 
 At the shop where Mr. Raterink makes tools and machinery, there used to be 15 men. Now there are five.
 ''They weren't offered any bailout,'' he said of those who lost their jobs. Then, of the Big Three and the mismanagement he perceives, he added, ''The wolf you let loose is at your door.''

HEADLINE: Another Month of Miserable Auto Sales

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
The Big Three automakers are scrambling to adjust their businesses to the reality of the market. But that reality is turning harsher by the month. 
 Vehicle sales in the United States sank 36.7 percent in November to the lowest rate in 26 years, as the dour economy and tight credit markets made for another lonely month at dealerships around the country.
 ''It feels like we're back in 1982 right now,'' said Bob Carter, a Toyota vice president. 
 General Motors, down 41.3 percent, Ford Motor, down 30.5 percent, and Chrysler, down 47.1 percent, hope the ugly numbers will help them explain their desperation as they ask Congress for $34 billion in government-backed loans to keep them alive. Executives from those companies will be in Washington on Thursday and Friday to make their case.
 But while those companies have been losing sales and market share for years, they also can point to Tuesday's reports from their foreign competitors as evidence that their current woes are not entirely self-inflicted. At Toyota, which was offering loans with zero percent interest on 11 of its normally popular models, sales fell 33.9 percent. Honda's sales dropped 31.6 percent and Nissan's plunged 42.2 percent.
 ''This isn't a Detroit issue; the whole industry is certainly suffering,'' said Ron Pinelli, the president of MotorIntelligence.com, which tracks industry sales.
 ''It's not a question of what the automakers can do,'' Mr. Pinelli said. ''It's a question of consumer confidence. You can't induce someone to buy something if they don't feel good about the purchase -- if it's just not the right time to buy or they can't get financing for it.''
 Over all, vehicle sales are 16.3 percent lower than they were for the first 11 months of 2007. In November, the decline for cars and trucks was roughly the same: down 36.9 percent for trucks and 36.5 percent for passenger cars. That shows the problem is not merely lower demand for trucks, which consumers shunned when gasoline prices rose above $4 a gallon last summer. 
 ''Our industry is in a much more severe situation than the rest of the economy,'' Michael C. DiGiovanni, G.M.'s executive director for global market analysis, said. ''It's in an unsustainable position for all manufacturers. We cannot continue to operate at these levels or else the entire industry's going to go down.''
 November was the second consecutive month in which the industry had an annual sales rate lower than 11 million. In 2005, automakers sold 17 million cars and trucks in the United States. In June of that year, G.M. sold 558,092 vehicles, more than it has sold in the last four months combined.
 ''Let me tell you something, folks. We've got much better products right now in every single category than we did in June of '05,'' said Mark LaNeve, G.M.'s vice president for North American sales and marketing. ''I've never seen anything even remotely close to this for our industry.''
 Many of the discounts available last month will still be available in December, but analysts say sales will probably not rise until consumers see more stability in the economy.
 Toyota's discounts in November averaged $1,908 a vehicle, a record high for the company, according to the auto information service and publisher Edmunds.com. Incentives were more than $3,000 for each vehicle for the American automakers, but the average for each company was down slightly from October. Many dealers have been offering well over $10,000 off the sticker price of some vehicles, particularly trucks and S.U.V.'s, and some are advertising ''buy one, get one free'' deals to clear out their inventory.
 ''The story of the industry seems to have shifted a little bit from potential buyers being unable to close the deal due to the credit tightening, towards a widespread reluctance to purchase durable goods at this point, amid continued very weak consumer confidence,'' Brian A. Johnson, an analyst with Barclays Capital, wrote in a recent report.
 Ford said it planned to manufacture 430,000 vehicles in the first quarter of 2009, 38 percent fewer than it did in the same period of 2008. It also expects to build 430,000 vehicles in the current quarter.
 ''We believe the economy will continue to weaken in 2009,'' James D. Farley, Ford's marketing chief, said. ''Our near-term production plan reflects this view, as we continue to align capacity with customer demand.''
 Jesse Toprak, executive director for industry analysis with Edmunds.com, noted that significantly lower sales to rental-car companies and other fleet operators made the sales figures for the Detroit automakers worse than expected. He said he believed that some of that reduction was intentional to make their performance ''look worse than it really was to try to make the case to Congress, 'Look, we're desperate.' ''
 But that is not to say that the market is not miserable.
 ''There's a lot of consumers that postponed buying a car in the past year,'' Mr. Toprak said. ''They're waiting for the dust to settle.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Partly Recovers From Sell-Off

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris.

 BODY:
Wall Street mounted a modest recovery on Tuesday, gaining back nearly half of the enormous collapse that opened the week, as investors picked up bargain-price stocks and pushed Treasury yields to record lows.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 270 points after crisscrossing the chart in the afternoon, swinging across a nearly 300-point range and even dipping into negative territory for a brief moment in the early afternoon. 
 By the end of the session, the blue-chip index was at 8,419.09, up 3.3 percent and reclaiming more than a third of its 680-point swoon on Monday. 
 While the gains provided some sense of comfort, the size of the trading range underscored the immense volatility and uncertainty that remained ingrained in the market. Investors are still not certain of anything, whether it is how long the recession will last or which company could be the next to teeter on collapse. Double-digit percentage point swings have become the norm for shares of some high-profile businesses, shifts that once took weeks to occur.
 Citigroup and Bank of America both gained close to 12 percent, a day after each stock fell more than 20 percent. Financial shares were the day's top performers, although General Electric led the Dow industrials with a 13.6 percent gain.
 The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained nearly 4 percent, to 848.81, an encouraging performance after the benchmark index dropped nearly 9 percent on Monday. The Nasdaq rose 3.7 percent, to 1,449.80.
 The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 3.17 percent, the lowest level in at least three decades, and the 10-year yield dipped to 2.67 percent, just above a 46-year low. Investors have aggressively moved into government notes since the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, said that the central bank might begin purchasing the bonds to bolster the economy.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 17/32, to 109 11/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 2.67 percent, from 2.73 percent late Monday.
 Oil prices continued to fall, slipping $2.32 to settle at $46.96 a barrel.
 Investors were also looking ahead to the unemployment report on Friday from the Labor Department, arguably the most important update on the health of the economy. Economists expect that businesses shed another 300,000 jobs last month, adding to the losses that have hit every month this year. 
 Shares of Ford Motor and General Motors rose more than 5 percent despite reports of anemic sales figures for November. Executives from G.M. were in Washington on Tuesday to ask Congressional lawmakers for federal financing to help keep their business afloat.
 In Europe, shares moved higher in afternoon trading after a sharp decline in the morning session. The FTSE 100 index in London gained 1.4 percent; the CAC 40 in Paris was up 2.4 percent; and the DAX in Frankfurt gained 3.1 percent. 
 ''We've had a lot of very bad news,'' said Francisco Salvador, director at Venture Finanzas in Madrid. He cited worldwide declines in the manufacturing industry and a worrisome rise in the cost of insuring corporate debt against default.
 Mr. Salvador also cited concern that some investors were having trouble staying afloat after reports that several big funds were either reorganizing or halting redemptions. ''There is panic among the hedge funds,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Higher Education May Soon Be Unaffordable for Most Americans, Report Says

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

DATELINE: The rising cost of college 

 BODY:
even before the recession -- threatens to put higher education out of reach for most Americans, according to the annual report from the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education. 
 Over all, the report found, published college tuition and fees increased 439 percent from 1982 to 2007, adjusted for inflation, while median family income rose 147 percent. Student borrowing has more than doubled in the last decade, and students from lower-income families, on average, get smaller grants from the colleges they attend than students from more affluent families. 
 ''If we go on this way for another 25 years, we won't have an affordable system of higher education,'' said Patrick M. Callan, president of the center, a nonpartisan organization that promotes access to higher education. 
 ''When we come out of the recession,'' Mr. Callan added, ''we're really going to be in jeopardy, because the educational gap between our work force and the rest of the world will make it very hard to be competitive. Already, we're one of the few countries where 25- to 34-year-olds are less educated than older workers.'' 
 Although college enrollment has continued to rise in recent years, Mr. Callan said, it is not clear how long that can continue.
 ''The middle class has been financing it through debt,'' he said. ''The scenario has been that families that have a history of sending kids to college will do whatever if takes, even if that means a huge amount of debt.'' 
 But low-income students, he said, will be less able to afford college. Already, he said, the strains are clear. 
 The report, ''Measuring Up 2008,'' is one of the few to compare net college costs -- that is, a year's tuition, fees, room and board, minus financial aid -- against median family income. Those findings are stark. Last year, the net cost at a four-year public university amounted to 28 percent of the median family income, while a four-year private university cost 76 percent of the median family income. 
 The share of income required to pay for college, even with financial aid, has been growing especially fast for lower-income families, the report found. 
 Among the poorest families -- those with incomes in the lowest 20 percent -- the net cost of a year at a public university was 55 percent of median income, up from 39 percent in 1999-2000. At community colleges, long seen as a safety net, that cost was 49 percent of the poorest families' median income last year, up from 40 percent in 1999-2000. 
 The likelihood of large tuition increases next year is especially worrying, Mr. Callan said. ''Most governors' budgets don't come out until January, but what we're seeing so far is Florida talking about a 15 percent increase, Washington State talking about a 20 percent increase, and California with a mixture of budget cuts and enrollment cuts,'' he said. 
 In a separate report released this week by the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges, the public universities acknowledged the looming crisis, but painted a different picture.
 That report emphasized that families have many higher-education choices, from community colleges, where tuition and fees averaged about $3,200, to private research universities, where they cost more than $33,000. 
 ''We think public higher education is affordable right now, but we're concerned that it won't be, if the changes we're seeing continue, and family income doesn't go up,'' said David Shulenburger, the group's vice president for academic affairs and co-author of the report. ''The public conversation is very often in terms of a $35,000 price tag, but what you get at major public research university is, for the most part, still affordable at 6,000 bucks a year.'' 
 While tuition has risen at public universities, his report said, that has largely been to make up for declining state appropriations. The report offered its own cost projections, not including room and board. 
 ''Projecting out to 2036, tuition would go from 11 percent of the family budget to 24 percent of the family budget, and that's pretty huge,'' Mr. Shulenburger said. ''We only looked at tuition and fees because those are the only things we can control.'' 
 Looking at total costs, as families must, he said, his group shared Mr. Callan's concerns. 
 Mr. Shulenburger's report suggested that public universities explore a variety of approaches to lower costs -- distance learning, better use of senior year in high school, perhaps even shortening college from four years. 
 ''There's an awful lot of experimentation going on right now, and that needs to go on,'' he said. ''If you teach a course by distance with 1,000 students, does that affect learning? Till we know the answer, it's difficult to control costs in ways that don't affect quality.'' 
 Mr. Callan, for his part, urged a reversal in states' approach to higher-education financing. 
 ''When the economy is good, and state universities are somewhat better funded, we raise tuition as little as possible,'' he said. ''When the economy is bad, we raise tuition and sock it to families, when people can least afford it. That's exactly the opposite of what we need.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 4, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the increasing cost of higher education gave an incorrect context for two figures: the 439 percent increase in college tuition and fees and the 147 percent increase in median family income since 1982. Those figures were not adjusted for inflation. The error was repeated for the data in an accompanying chart. A corrected chart appears at nytimes.com/national.
 The article also described incorrectly the report for the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education that cited the figures. It is produced every other year, not annually.

HEADLINE: When Laws and Liberties Test Each Other's Limits

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
''The End of America,'' an unsettling documentary polemic about the erosion of civil liberties in the wake of 9/11, brings up matters many of us would rather not contemplate in the middle of a financial crisis and on the eve of a new administration. Federal laws enacted during the last seven years that threaten our constitutional rights, it reminds us, remain in effect. 
 The pointedly inflammatory film, adapted from Naomi Wolf's book ''The End of America: A Letter of Warning to a Young Patriot,'' compares the Bush administration's attempts to discourage dissent and to wield increasingly unchecked power to the events preceding the establishment of 20th-century dictatorships in Germany, Italy, Chile and elsewhere. Without explicitly invoking the word, it implies that since 2001 the United States has drifted toward fascism in the name of fighting terror. 
 Tightly constructed and fiercely one-sided, ''The End of America,'' directed by Annie Sundberg and Ricki Stern (''The Devil Came on Horseback''), interweaves excerpts from a lecture in New York given by Ms. Wolf with film clips and interviews illustrating her contention that the rise of those dictatorships created a ''blueprint'' that the Bush administration, consciously or not, has followed.
 According to Ms. Wolf, the first and fundamental tool for acquiring power is the manipulation of fear. In the shell-shocked post-
 9/11 climate, the overwhelming public reaction to the Patriot Act of 2001, which gave law enforcement agencies expanded powers of surveillance, was mute acceptance of whatever was deemed necessary to keep us safe. Since then, she says, a color-coded system of terror alerts has been effectively wielded to keep us on edge.
 From here, Ms. Wolf describes a 10-step program toward authoritarian rule that includes the creation of secret prisons where torture takes place; the deployment of a paramilitary force (Blackwater, which the film calls a contemporary American variation on Mussolini's private army of ''black shirts''); the development of an internal surveillance system; the harassment of citizens' groups; and the arbitrary detention and release of ordinary civilians. 
 The film's most disturbing moments are its accounts of James Yee, a United States Army chaplain at Guantanamo, who was accused of espionage and held in solitary confinement for 76 days before being released, and Maher Arar, a Syrian-born Canadian telecommunications engineer, who was detained at Kennedy International Airport, then later deported to Syria, where he was imprisoned for a year and tortured. He was eventually cleared of charges of terrorism. 
 The seventh step, selecting key individuals for harassment, cites the Dixie Chicks and Dan Rather as prominent cases. The eighth step, the restriction of the press, focuses on the case of Josh Wolf, a journalist jailed for 226 days for refusing to turn over videotapes he made of police brutality at a July 2005 demonstration in San Francisco. 
 The ninth step, the equating of political dissidents with traitors, fleetingly examines the Bush administration's floating of the word ''treason'' to describe The New York Times's publication of classified information about the government's monitoring of overseas telephone calls. All these middle steps might be described as examples of selective intimidation intended to inhibit dissent. The case histories are glossed over. 
 The final step in Ms. Wolf's Top 10 is the suspension of the rule of law. She cites the refusal of Bush administration insiders subpoenaed to appear before Congress to testify in the United States attorneys scandal. The film ends on a note of stern warning: the 11th step might be the imposing of martial law.
 If the film's vision of the steps leading toward a homegrown fascist state qualifies as paranoid, there is still enough here to make you shiver. Could it happen here? Maybe. A little fear -- not the collective panic that followed 9/11 -- can be a useful thing.

 CHINA'S ECONOMY SLOWS DOWN
 And Turns to Its Thrifty Millions
 It might be up to the frugal to rescue China. China's economy, once the fastest growing in the world, has slowed down alarmingly fast. Projections by the World Bank and other financial institutions have been revised downward, and China is looking to its legion of consumers, among them the hard-saving peasants, to pick up that slack. But their participation rests on many factors, not the least of which a deep-seated need to save. Page A6 
 SCHOOL IS BOMBED IN IRAQ
 A bomb on a horse-drawn cart exploded near a primary school in Mosul killing six adults and three children. The attack was unusual because while civilians are often hurt and killed in attacks in the embattled country, few places frequented by children have been singled out. This particular explosion took place as students left the school for the day. Page A14 
 RWANDAN CONVICTED IN GENOCIDE
 A Rwandan musician, Rimon Bikindi, has been convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for inciting genocide. Mr. Bikindi, above, was sentenced to 15 years in prison for his role in the hate campaign that led to the 1994 slaughter of Tutsis by Hutus. The court found him guilty of using a public address system along the roads, to urge Hutus to rise up and exterminate the Tutsi. Page A12 
 BRITISH COURT ORDERS CLERIC TO JAIL
 A radical Islamic preacher in Europe, dubbed by British tabloids ''Osama bin Laden's right-hand man,'' was sentenced by a panel of immigration judges in Britain to an immediate return to prison. Britain's Interior Ministry warned that the preacher, Abu Qatada, might attempt to flee if he was allowed to remain out on the bail he was granted five months ago. Page A8 
 VENICE FLOODWATERS RECEDE
 Tourists in Venice were forced inside -- or into hip-waders -- when floodwaters in the city reached their highest point in 22 years. By Tuesday morning, the water levels had eased to 39 inches, down from a high of 61 inches. It was the fourth highest flood level in Venice's recent history. Page A12
 DIVIDE IN CANADIAN GOVERNMENT
 The governor general of Canada announced that she would cut short a state visit to Europe and return to Canada as a coalition of opposition parties sought to unseat the Conservative government. Governor General Michaelle Jean, who represents Queen Elizabeth II as the nation's head of state, has the power to appoint a new government, dissolve Parliament and call for a new election or effectively allow the Conservatives to remain in control for up to a year.

 STUDY FINDS RISING TUITION MAY PUT COLLEGE OUT OF REACH FOR MANY
 Forget the recession. Paying for college may soon become impossible for most Americans no matter what the Dow does. College tuition (including fees) rose 439 percent from 1982 to 2007, according to an annual report from the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education. That far outpaced median family income, which increased 147 percent. PAGE A19 
 SENATOR TO RETIRE AFTER TERM
 Senator Mel Martinez of Florida, one of the most prominent Hispanic leaders in the Republican Party, said he would not seek a second term in 2010. Florida Republicans who have known Mr. Martinez for years said he probably chose to step aside after weighing the toll of a bruising campaign in 2010 against the smaller rewards of serving in a Democratic-controlled Congress. PAGE A20 
 SEEKING SLEEP FOR DOCTORS-TO-BE
 Most of the nation's workers would be happy to get more sleep every night. Maybe none more so than medical residents, the recent medical school graduates who care for patients under the supervision of a fully licensed physician. A national panel of medical experts proposed significant and costly changes for training new doctors in the nation's hospitals, recommending mandatory sleep breaks and more structured shift changes to reduce the risk of fatigue-related errors. PAGE A23 
 ILLINOIS OFFICERS CHARGED
 Fifteen Illinois law enforcement officers were arrested in an F.B.I. sting on charges that they accepted cash in exchange for providing armed protection for drug dealing operations in south suburban Chicago. Patrick J. Fitzgerald, the United States attorney, said two of the officers helped an undercover F.B.I. agent unload and deliver duffel bags stuffed with drugs. PAGE A23 
 OBAMA REACHES OUT TO GOVERNORS
 With the economic crisis tearing holes in most state budgets, President-elect Barack Obama reached out to the nation's governors, including Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California, above, and promised them he will come to their aid with a program to build bridges, schools and other public projects. Mr. Obama convened the National Governors Association meeting in an effort to forge a bipartisan attitude before attacking the nation's economic problems. PAGE A19 
 CLINTON BRINGS A RARE ReSUMe
 As President-elect Barack Obama's choice for secretary of state, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton carries a resume that is in many ways thinner than her predecessors. Still, Mrs. Clinton's selection has electrified the diplomatic world. And Mrs. Clinton's backers say that her background masks diplomatic skills that many who preceded her in the job did not have.

 PROMINENT CLINIC PLANS TO POST 
 Staff's Ties to Medical Industry
 The Cleveland Clinic, one of the nation's most well-known medical research centers, has begun reporting the business relationships that its 1,800 doctors and scientists have with pharmaceutical and device companies. The information is going to be available on the clinic's Web site. Above, Dr. Viktor Krebs, an orthopedic surgeon at the clinic, shows a disclosure letter describing his ties to the maker of a product he will use in the patient's knee replacement surgery. Page B1 
 DOWN TO TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES
 The auto companies are taking on water, and as they go back to Washington to seek help bailing out, a question remains: what are they going to do with their private planes? Congress issued a pointed rebuke after representatives from the Big Three flew to Washington in private jets to plead for money the first time. Now, the executives of the Big Three are turning their next journey to ask for bailout money into a road trip. This move saves resources, and potentially face, but it also introduces a hint of public relations gamesmanship. Page B1 
 MANHATTAN'S OFFICE SPACE SURPLUS
 Remember when New York's real estate market was a savage, fast-moving place? Now is the time to seek out office space. With the market as cold as the weather, 16 million square feet is vacant and waiting in 68 office buildings around Manhattan, according to Colliers ABR, a commercial brokerage firm. As companies roll with the financial punches, the big market has been in subleases, with rents reduced by 20 or 30 percent. Page B5 
 IT'S ALL ABOUT THAT BLACK HELVETICA
 A new breed of company has arisen from the riot of choice that is online advertising. The companies are seeking to impose a little order and clarity, determining which elements of ads work, as well as why and with whom. They could change the way advertising is perceived. The creative minds behind an ad believe that an idea or an emotional response drives an ad's success, but perhaps it is merely a matter of having a pretty background color and a nifty font. Page B3 
 SPECULATION LIFTS YAHOO STOCK
 Yahoo's stock rose by 7 percent, as investors bid up shares on a faint whisper of an even fainter hope. The Wall Street Journal reported that AOL's former chief executive, Jonathan Miller, was speaking with private equity and sovereign wealth funds about raising money to buy the struggling Internet company. People in private equity circles said that Mr. Miller had indeed been talking about possibilities for Yahoo since he left AOL but that a deal was highly unlikely, given current conditions. Page B3

 MODERATE-COST HOUSING DELAYED
 As New York City's housing agency and the mayor's budget office butt heads, the construction of hundreds of homes for low- to middle-income New Yorkers has been delayed, developers, city officials and housing advocates say. The crux of the debate is a dispute over financing homeownership projects on city-owned land, with the housing agency facing a budget office reluctant to spend city money in neighborhoods with troubled housing markets.

 FOOTBALL AT UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT 
 Rises From Ashes to Victory
 The last time anybody used the University of Vermont's football stadium for its intended purpose, varsity football, it was 1974. Since then, it has been used mostly for soccer. But when Doug DeLuca enrolled as a freshman, all of that changed. Mr. DeLuca, after a Herculean effort, succeeded in getting a Vermont tackle football team on the field in just a year. Then in September 2007, Vermont's club team, whose members had no college playing experience, defeated the Vermont Ravens, a semiprofessional team. Page B11 
 BRYANT AND LAKERS FLYING STEALTH
 Kobe Bryant and LeBron James are joined by their incredible feats of athleticism and looming status as potential free agents. But while there's been a veritable feeding frenzy around Mr. James, capped by his recent visit to Madison Square Garden, Mr. Bryant has been relatively ignored. And for good reason. Once the darlings of tabloid headlines and news media outbursts, Mr. Bryant and the Lakers have had a relatively quiet season. Page B15

HEADLINE: Manhattan Awash in Open Office Space

BYLINE: By J. ALEX TARQUINIO

 BODY:
Last year, when the New York real estate market was still frothy, large blocks of office space were hard to come by. Not anymore. 
 Almost 16 million square feet is currently listed as available in large blocks in 68 office buildings in Manhattan, according to Colliers ABR, a commercial brokerage firm. That is nearly double the space available a year ago, both in terms of the number of large office blocks -- which in New York usually means 100,000 square feet or more -- and in terms of total square feet.
 Those figures are widely expected to go much higher, said Robert L. Sammons, the managing director of research for Colliers ABR. He said it was difficult to get a handle on exactly how much space financial companies alone might put back onto the Manhattan office market over the next year or so. 
 ''Honestly, I don't think any of these financial firms know how this is going to play out,'' he said. ''They are trying to figure out how many people they will need on staff, and in some cases how they are going to stay in business.''
 Pending layoffs in the financial industry certainly account for some of the space on the market. But there are other factors. Some companies are moving into new headquarters -- which were first planned years ago -- while others are disposing of real estate that they came into through acquisitions.
 By far the biggest increase in availability has been in the sublease market. Currently, at least 16 large office blocks are being marketed for sublease in Manhattan, up from just 3 listed at this time last year, according to Colliers ABR.
 Michael Colacino, the president of Studley, a real estate brokerage firm that specializes in representing office tenants, said the sublet space that had come onto the market recently was attractively priced.
 He said some tenants might do better by shopping the sublet market rather than trying to renegotiate a better rent with their current landlords. ''A lot of landlords are still in denial,'' Mr. Colacino said, ''but the sublease space is priced realistically for the actual market conditions.''
 Mr. Colacino estimates that the actual rents on deals signed in the last three months are down by as much as 20 to 30 percent from the going rents at the end of the summer -- to around $75 to $80 a square foot annually in Midtown and around $45 a square foot downtown.
 Among current offerings -- including both subleases and direct leases from owners -- roughly a quarter of the space in the Midtown and downtown office markets became available because a financial company either did not renew its lease or decided to market the space for sublet.
 But the picture could become much starker next year. Among large office blocks that brokers expect to hit the market, Mr. Sammons estimates that the financial industry will account for roughly one-third of the new space coming on the market in Midtown and more than half of the new space downtown. 
 Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank all have leases that Mr. Sammons counted among the potential new listings of large office blocks. And that list does not include Citigroup -- although the banking giant has announced that it will lay off more than 50,000 employees worldwide -- because Mr. Sammons said it was too soon to know if Citigroup would give up any large office blocks in Manhattan.
 So far this year, brokers say, the main event in Midtown has been the completion of One Bryant Park, a 54-story office tower that recently opened at the corner of 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas.
 As the main tenant, Bank of America, which is based in Charlotte, N.C., moves employees into this new building, it is giving up earlier leases for hundreds of thousands of square feet in other prominent Midtown office buildings, like 9 West 57th Street. Brokers also widely expect the bank to offer for sublet more than 300,000 square feet that it currently leases in 50 Rockefeller Plaza.
 JPMorgan Chase has already put some large blocks of space on the sublet market near its world headquarters, at 270 Park Avenue, between 47th and 48th Streets. Chase is marketing sublets for 140,000 square feet at 320 Park Avenue, and 195,000 square feet at 237 Park Avenue. The bank acquired the lease at 237 Park Avenue when it bought Bear Stearns in March.
 Chase plans to keep the former Bear Stearns headquarters, though, which is at 383 Madison Avenue, between 46th and 47th Streets. Chase plans to move its investment banking unit into that building, which is just one block from its own headquarters.
 ''We are looking to make the most economical use of the space that we have for our employees, businesses and shareholders,'' said Darlene Taylor, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan Chase.
 Downtown, some large blocks of space are expected to become available late next year, when Goldman Sachs completes its new 2.1-million-square-foot 43-story world headquarters at 200 West Street in Battery Park City. When Goldman starts moving into its new building, it plans to allow earlier leases for more than 1.5 million square feet in Lower Manhattan to expire. The bank is also marketing for sublet 600,000 square feet of space that it leases at 77 Water Street.
 There is also a great deal of speculation swirling around the ultimate destination of Merrill Lynch, which is to be acquired by Bank of America. The merger could close this month or early next year.
 Some brokers suggest that Bank of America might decide to move Merrill Lynch from its headquarters at 4 World Financial Center, where Merrill leases 2.1 million square feet, to be closer to the bank's new Bryant Park headquarters. If that happens, it would shift even more of the financial industry from Wall Street to Midtown, following what has been a long-term trend.

HEADLINE: A Book Made for 100,000 Euros (Includes Labor, Not Counting Michelangelo's)

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
A day after the official declaration of a national recession, visitors journeyed to the New York Public Library from Atlanta, Palm Beach, Fla., White Plains and Queens to see a $126,000 coffee-table book that is actually the size of a coffee table. 
 ''We have to catch a plane to Florida in half an hour, but we wanted to see the most beautiful book in the world,'' said Betty Katarain Rosado, an interior designer from Palm Beach who stood in the cold for 20 minutes waiting for the library to open with her husband, Gilbert, an engineer. They had time for just a glimpse of The Book at its first public viewing in the United States. 
 O.K.: it's more than a coffee-table book. The rare, 61-pound book, made recently by hand, was toiled over by scholars, artists and artisans. Called ''Michelangelo: La Dotta Mano'' (''Michelangelo: The Learned Hand''), the book, an Italian language celebration of his work, cost $100,000 euros (about $126,864) to make in Italy and was donated on Monday to the library, where it will be on view through Monday.
 The Rosados oohed and aahed and snapped each other's photographs with the book when they finally saw it displayed behind Lucite on the western side of the Bill Blass Catalog Room on the third floor. ''You'd need your life savings to buy it,'' Mr. Rosado said, before racing to La Guardia Airport. 
 Not to be too decadent about it, the cover of the 264-page book -- which took months to print and construct employing Renaissance skills -- is adorned with a bas-relief depiction of Michelangelo's ''Madonna of the Steps,'' sculptured on a piece of white marble from one of the Polvaccio quarries in Carrara, Italy, that supplied stone for the master's statues.
 Its positively sybaritic binding is swathed in red velvet from the same Italian workshop that supplied stage curtains to the Metropolitan Opera and La Scala in Milan. And the book's photographs and plates of drawings and images of the Sistine Chapel are printed on luxurious paper of pure cotton produced in Italy.
 The creation of the book is ''a provocation in the age of the Internet,'' said Marilena Ferrari, president of FMR, a fine-art publishing house in Italy. ''It is important to reaffirm that books are not disappearing.'' She also heads the company's charitable foundation, which donated the book to the library. 
 Though not the most expensive book ever made -- some high-end books have been adorned with precious metals or gemstones -- it is ''special for its rarity,'' said Paul LeClerc, president of the library. So far, only 33 copies of a planned limited edition of 99 have been made; Ms. Ferrari said 20 had been sold.
 Dr. LeClerc added: ''It is one of the single greatest books made in the last 100 years. There is nothing else at this level.''
 Joan Block, a retired credit-collection manager who traveled from Queens to see the book, gave it a thumbs up, but added, ''I guess the price is pretty high in a recession.'' She studied it some more. ''But for Michelangelo, maybe that's not a lot.'' 
 Can the cost of the book be justified? ''Such a beautiful book has relevance in a time of economic hardship,'' said Ms. Ferrari, a businesswoman who is not related to the automobile family. ''In no way can I change the world, but I can send a message of beauty -- because, fundamentally, this is a message of hope. Mankind can create beauty, and that must be remembered.''
 The donation is the first in the United States; copies were given to the Prado Museum in Madrid and the City Council of Bologna earlier this year. Next week, the book will reside in the library's rare book division, ''where it will join the first copy of the Gutenberg Bible brought to the Americas,'' said Michael Inman, the library's curator of rare books. 
 But not all the visitors were ecstatic. ''I'm a little disappointed,'' said Muriel Dolinsky, who described herself as a housewife from White Plains, who had traveled with her neighbor, Sandy Meyers, a geriatric social worker, to see the book. 
 ''I'd hoped we could see it opened up,'' Ms. Dolinsky said. 
 Sealed in its plastic case, though, she could observe the book's dimensions -- 28 inches tall, 18 inches wide and 3 inches thick -- up close, Ms. Ferrari said, to the multiples within the sequence of the so-called Golden Ratio, which long represented the universal law of harmony in classical architecture, sculpture and painting.
 Indeed, to Dr. LeClerc, the work has ''symbolic significance, because it reminds us in a dramatic way of the importance of the book in shaping Western culture. It is how enlightenment was disseminated until the advent of the Internet.''

HEADLINE: BRITISH BALANCE BENEFIT VS. COST OF LATEST DRUGS

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

DATELINE: RUISLIP, England 

 BODY:
When Bruce Hardy's kidney cancer spread to his lung, his doctor recommended an expensive new pill from Pfizer. But Mr. Hardy is British, and the British health authorities refused to buy the medicine. His wife has been distraught.
 ''Everybody should be allowed to have as much life as they can,'' Joy Hardy said in the couple's modest home outside London. 
 If the Hardys lived in the United States or just about any European country other than Britain, Mr. Hardy would most likely get the drug, although he might have to pay part of the cost. A clinical trial showed that the pill, called Sutent, delays cancer progression for six months at an estimated treatment cost of $54,000. 
 But at that price, Mr. Hardy's life is not worth prolonging, according to a British government agency, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. The institute, known as NICE, has decided that Britain, except in rare cases, can afford only $:15,000, or about $22,750, to save six months of a citizen's life. 
 British authorities, after a storm of protest, are reconsidering their decision on the cancer drug and others.
 For years, Britain was almost alone in using evidence of cost-effectiveness to decide what to pay for. But skyrocketing prices for drugs and medical devices have led a growing number of countries to ask the hardest of questions: How much is life worth? For many, NICE has the answer. 
 Top health officials in Austria, Brazil, Colombia and Thailand said in interviews that NICE now strongly influences their policies.
 ''All the middle-income countries -- in Eastern Europe, Central and South America, the Middle East and all over Asia -- are aware of NICE and are thinking about setting up something similar,'' said Dr. Andreas Seiter, a senior health specialist at the World Bank.
 Even in the United States, rising costs have led some in Congress to propose an institute that would compare the effectiveness of new medical technologies, although the proposals so far would not allow for price considerations. At the present rate of growth, medical costs will increase to 25 percent of the nation's gross domestic product in 2025 from 16 percent, with half of the increase coming from new drugs and devices, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
 To arrest this trend, the United States needs to adopt at least some of NICE's methods, said Dr. Mark McClellan and Dr. Sean Tunis, who served earlier in the Bush administration as, respectively, administrator and chief medical officer of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Dr. Tunis said he spent a lot of time in government ''learning about NICE and trying to adopt the processes and mechanisms they used, and we just couldn't.''
 That's because the idea of using price to determine which drugs or devices Medicare or Medicaid provides has provoked fierce protests. But Dr. McClellan said the American government would soon have no choice. 
 Drug and device makers, which once routinely denounced the British for questioning product prices, have begun quietly slashing prices in Britain to gain NICE's coveted approval, especially because other nations are following the institute's lead. Companies have said that they will consult with NICE to help determine which experimental compounds enter the final stage of clinical trials, so the British agency's officials will soon influence which drugs enter the market in the United States.
 The British government created NICE a decade ago to ensure that every pound spent buys as many years of good-quality life as possible, but the agency is increasingly rejecting expensive treatments. The denials have led to debate over what is to blame: company prices or the health institute's math. 
 Dr. Michael Rawlins, chairman of NICE, blames the industry, saying that some companies raise prices ''to get profits up so their executives can get better bonuses.'' Dr. Karol Sikora, a prominent London oncologist, said that the institute's math was flawed and that Dr. Rawlins had a ''personal vendetta'' against cancer treatments. 
 Drug company executives who were interviewed uniformly promised to cooperate with NICE, but industry advocates were not so kind. Robert Goldberg, vice president of the Center for Medicine in the Public Interest, an advocacy group financed by drug makers, likened Dr. Rawlins and his institute to terrorists and said their decisions were morally indefensible.
 Developing a Method
 It all started with Viagra. 
 Pfizer's introduction of the drug in 1998 panicked British health officials, who feared it would wreck the government's health budget. So they placed restrictions on its use. Pfizer sued, claiming the government's decision was arbitrary. To defend itself against similar claims, the government needed a standard method of rationing. The following year, NICE opened.
 Asked whether he thought the institute would succeed, Frank Dobson, the Labor health minister at the time, famously said, ''Probably not, but it's worth a bloody good try.''
 Britain's National Health Service provides 95 percent of the nation's care from an annual budget, so paying for costly treatments means less money for, say, sick children. Before NICE, hospitals and clinics often came to different decisions about which drugs to buy, creating geographic disparities in care that led to outrage. (Such disparities are common in the United States, even for federal Medicare patients.)
 Now, any drug or device approved by the institute must be offered to patients. The institute has also written hundreds of treatment guidelines in hopes of improving, and making more consistent, basic medical care. 
 The institute has analyzed the cost-effectiveness of surgical operations, cancer screening tests and medical devices. For example, it found that drug-coated cardiac stents were worth only $450 more than bare-metal ones. In the United States, stent price differences are often far wider.
 Five years ago, the British health institute recommended more emergency room CT scans of patients suffering from head trauma -- forcing hospitals to buy more machines.
 But the decisions that get the most attention are those involving new drugs. Any drug that provides an extra six months of good-quality life for $:10,000 -- about $15,150 -- or less is automatically approved, while those that give six months for $22,750 or less might get approved. More expensive medicines have been approved only rarely. The spending limits represent the health institute's best guess for how much the nation can afford.
 After consulting a citizens group, the institute decided that the nation should spend the same amount saving or improving the life of a 75-year-old smoker as it would a 5-year-old. 
 'Muddling Through'
 The institute's decision-making process involves a series of independent assessments, consultations with manufacturers, committee meetings, comment periods for outsiders and appeals that, taken together, Dr. Rawlins described as ''procedural justice,'' or ''muddling through elegantly.'' While the institute provides advice, decisions are made by one of three committees made up of doctors, nurses and economists from outside the government. 
 Transparency recently became a high priority, but gaps in the idea of openness remain. At the institute's first public decision-making appraisal meeting in September, staff members handed a reporter a stack of documents, only to snatch them back moments later. The committee's chairman, Dr. David Barnett, was so intent on keeping the meeting brief that he told a committee member: ''This must be the last question. It must be relevant. Otherwise, you will feel my wrath.''
 To analyze the value of the drug that Mr. Hardy, the kidney cancer patient, wanted, and the value of three other kidney cancer medicines, the British institute hired a university group that considered how many months the drugs delayed cancer's progress.
 Firestorm of Protest
 The academics got drug prices and calculated the costs of administering them and treating their side effects. Not one of the drugs came close to being worth their expense, the group suggested. In a preliminary ruling in August, a committee from NICE agreed. 
 The decision caused a firestorm. Twenty-six prominent British oncologists wrote a letter to The Sunday Times saying that the institute assessed cancer treatments poorly and that patients were remortgaging their homes to buy drugs freely available in other countries.
 Given that fewer than 6,000 people per year in England and Wales are diagnosed with kidney cancer, ''Why put ourselves through so much heartache for very little money?'' Andrew Dillon, the institute's chief executive, asked in a September interview. ''The answer is that if we don't apply the same criteria even to small groups of patients, there's little value to what we do at all.''
 Dr. Sikora, who helped organize the August protest, predicted in a September interview that the institute would buckle under political pressure. 
 Flooded with anguished comments, the institute beat a hasty retreat. A preliminary consultation posted Nov. 5 said that the institute would instruct its appraisal committees to consider approving highly expensive life-saving drugs for terminal illnesses affecting fewer than 7,000 patients per year -- a policy that seems tailor-made for Sutent and the three other kidney cancer drugs.
 Negotiations with companies on possible discounts are continuing, and a committee is scheduled on Jan. 14 to make public this nascent compromise. 
 NICE has stood fast in other areas, though, rejecting Kineret for rheumatoid arthritis and Avonex for multiple sclerosis. In 2001, NICE ruled that Aricept and two other drugs used to treat Alzheimer's disease were worth their costs only if patients' conditions had increased from mild to moderate severity. 
 The analysis put a value on patients' improved thinking skills, and possible savings from delayed entry into nursing homes. Instead of pills, the institute suggested more counseling.
 Advocates for patients with Alzheimer's disease called the decision heartless.
 Dr. Rawlins said he was frustrated that his institute had been censured instead of the drug company executives who set sky-high prices. Take the case of Celgene, the maker of Revlimid, a drug for multiple myeloma, a bone-marrow cancer, that in a preliminary ruling on Oct. 28 the institute said was too costly.
 Celgene's first big seller was thalidomide, a decades-old medicine now used as a cancer treatment, which is so cheap to manufacture that a company in Brazil sells it for pennies a pill.
 Celgene initially spent very little on research and priced each pill in 1998 at $6. As the drug's popularity against cancer grew, the company raised the price 30-fold to about $180 per pill, or $66,000 per year. The price increases reflected the medicine's value, company executives said.
 In 2005, the company introduced Revlimid, a derivative of thalidomide that is supposed to be less toxic, but may be no more effective. Celgene priced it at about $260 per pill, or $94,000 per year.
 Offering Discounts
 Private and public insurers in the United States must pay whatever Celgene and other makers of unique cancer medicines decide to charge, so prices are soaring. Spending on cancer drugs and other such specialty medicines rose 9 percent last year and now represents 24 percent of the nation's drug bill, according to Health Strategies Group, a New Jersey consulting company. Drug expenses in 2006 grew faster than any other part of the nation's health bill except home care. 
 But because of the institute, Britain's National Health Service has been among the first to balk at paying such prices, which has led many companies to offer the British discounts unavailable almost anywhere else.
 Johnson & Johnson, for instance, agreed to charge for Velcade, another drug for multiple myeloma, only if tests showed it was effective in a particular patient. Novartis agreed to give free injections of Lucentis, a drug for age-related macular degeneration, if patients needed more than 14 shots. Dr. Rawlins said these deals were constructed by drug makers to hide from other countries the discounts offered in Britain. 
 ''It's a good deal for us, but I can't see that it will work in the long run because I can't see that others countries will be so dim as to not notice it,'' Dr. Rawlins said.
 A more prudent bureaucrat would never make such a remark. Dr. Rawlins said that he delighted in controversy, ''although I'll admit that it doesn't always work out.'' He wears thick glasses and fine suits whose pockets are stuffed with nicotine gum packages that rattle as he walks. He laughs easily, plays the piano and viola, and moves effortlessly between politics and medicine. 
 His criticisms of the pharmaceutical industry have sharpened.
 ''I want them to produce new drugs for conditions we really need treatments for, but I loathe their marketing practices, which corrupt doctors in a dreadful way,'' said Dr. Rawlins, who until recently practiced general medicine and for years was chairman of the British version of the Food and Drug Administration. ''And I'm very conscious that the prices the pharmaceutical industry charges are what they think the market will bear.''
 In 10 years, the health institute's budget has grown to $50 million from $13 million, and it is scheduled to rise to $142 million in four years. NICE has 270 employees, who include doctors, economists and pharmacists. 
 Worldwide Impact
 Agencies like NICE are popping up across the globe. Dr. Leonardo Cubillos, Colombia's national director of insurance, said that Colombia was using British methods to choose drugs for a national health insurance package.
 Membership in an international group of drug and device assessment agencies grew to 45 last year from 8 in 1992. The British institute has created a consulting group to advise foreign governments.
 Much of the reason for this proliferation of agencies is that, while prescription drugs represent just 10.3 percent of overall medical spending in the United States, that share is 17 percent on average in industrialized countries. 
 As spending on drugs soared in many nations -- often haphazardly -- overall health often showed little improvement. So international aid agencies are advising governments to adopt British assessments and deliberations to improve their public's health while lowering costs, and officials are listening -- a trend that is likely to accelerate during the present global economic slowdown.
 The health institutes in both Britain and Germany may soon suggest prices for drugs, a strategy intended to deflect political pressure back on the companies and shorten negotiations that now often take months.
 ''We have been told that the price is the price, but the worm is turning now,'' Dr. Barnett said.
 Company executives acknowledge that they are increasingly acceding to British demands to slash prices. 
 But the most pressing question for the industry is what influence the British institute will have in the United States. The United States already spends more than twice as much per capita on health care as the average of other industrialized nations, while getting generally poorer health outcomes.
 Michael O. Leavitt, the Bush administration's secretary of health and human services, said in a September speech that, at its present growth rate, health care spending ''could potentially drag our nation into a financial crisis that makes our major subprime mortgage crisis look like a warm summer rain.''
 And while there is fierce disagreement about how and whether to control drug and device expenses as part of a broader reform of the health system, many say some cost controls are inevitable. At a September device industry conference in Washington, a seminar on the issue was standing-room only and half of the questioners mentioned NICE. 
 John R. Dwyer Jr., a Washington lawyer who represents device makers, said that many in the industry have believed that major changes to control costs in the federal Medicare program were inevitable, and ''people see NICE as the only workable paradigm.'' 
 Meanwhile, Mr. Hardy waits. In recent weeks his growing tumor has pressed on a nerve that governs his voice. He can barely speak and is increasingly out of breath. The Hardys are hoping that in January NICE will approve the use of Sutent, allowing Mr. Hardy further treatment.
 ''It's hard to know that there is something out there that could help but they're saying you can't have it because of cost,'' said Ms. Hardy, who now speaks for her husband of 45 years. ''What price is life?''

HEADLINE: W.N.B.A. Folds Its Houston Team Over Finances

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
Cynthia Cooper-Dyke cannot fathom it: the Houston Comets, the team she guided to the W.N.B.A.'s first four championships, were shuttered Tuesday by the league, which scheduled a dispersal draft of their players, except the free agents, for Monday.
 ''Ever since the beginning of the W.N.B.A., the Comets were in the forefront, really the anchor of the league,'' Cooper-Dyke, the coach of the Prairie View A&M women's basketball team, said in a telephone interview. ''We were the first dynasty, the first champions, so it's really devastating to arrive at this point.'' 
 She said she spent ''all last night'' watching a highlight video of the title years and thinking about how her former teammate Kim Perrot, who died in 1999, would have reacted to the team's demise after only 12 seasons. ''This was one obstacle we couldn't overcome,'' she said.
 The league took control of the Comets over the summer from their underfinanced owner, Hilton Koch, a furniture retailer who acquired the team in early 2007.
 Donna Orender, the league's president, said some thought was given to moving the team, but priority was given to selling it to an owner who would keep it in Houston. She said she had talks with interested investors but ultimately negotiated with only one ownership group through last Friday. But without a deal done by Monday, the decision was made to close the doors on the league's franchise in Houston, the nation's 10th-largest television market.
 ''It's a big deal,'' Orender said from Florida. ''But it doesn't mean it can't come back. Sometimes to get your footing, you have to take your sneakers off and put them back on.'' 
 The Houston Oilers, an original American Football League franchise, left for Tennessee in 1997, but the N.F.L. expanded to Houston and the Texans began play in 2002.
 The Comets were a critical franchise in the W.N.B.A., with stars like Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes, and an instant success. Their average attendance started at 9,703 in 1997, peaked the next season at 12,602, fell off to 11,906 in 1999, then increased to 12,255 for the fourth title run. Only the Washington, New York and Phoenix teams outdrew the Comets in those years.
 By the time Koch acquired the Comets for $10 million from Les Alexander, the owner of the Houston Rockets, they were less successful on the court and were following a leaguewide decline in attendance. Koch's purchase was part of a shift in W.N.B.A. philosophy: whereas all teams were once owned by N.B.A. parents, Koch became the fifth outsider to buy into the league out of an eventual seven.
 Koch said he bought the Comets without a lot of time to prepare; it eventually became clear that he lacked the money to sustain the team. He cut costs by moving from the Toyota Center to the much-smaller Reliant Arena for the 2008 season. But once the season was over, talks with the league ended with him giving it control of the team. ''I couldn't sell it quickly enough to keep the team from going under,'' he said.
 He added that if the league had sold the team, he would not have recouped his investment or his operational losses. 
 ''I only wanted to risk myself so far,'' he said. ''My money was only going to last so long.'' 
 By turning the team over to the league, he said, ''I was just looking at what the projections would be, and we both agreed that I couldn't lose my furniture business, which is what put me in the position to do what I did.''
 Orender said the Comets' situation was more of a singular situation than another sign of the recession's impact on sports, which has led the N.B.A. to lay off 80 workers.
 The W.N.B.A.'s average attendance, national television ratings and merchandise sales rose in 2008, and five new major sponsors signed up. And the league will start next season with an ESPN deal that for the first time pays it an upfront rights fee. 
 Still, Raymond Sauer, the chairman of the economics department at Clemson University, said the recession might have limited the number of possible suitors or tempered the risk they were willing to take. 
 Orender said: ''In another time, would there have been double the amount of interested investors? I don't know.''
 For Cooper-Dyke, it remains stunning that the Comets did not survive.
 ''I thought things would work out and the Comets would be alive and well,'' she said. ''It's shocking.''

HEADLINE: PURSUING U.S. AID, G.M. ACCEPTS NEED FOR DRASTIC CUTS

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting from Detroit, and David M. Herszenhorn from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
General Motors, increasingly desperate for a federal bailout to stave off financial collapse, told Congress on Tuesday that it was willing to drastically shrink every aspect of its operations to ensure its long-term survival.
 On the same day that the industry reported its worst sales month in 26 years, the three Detroit automakers delivered new business plans to lawmakers in the hope of winning support for $34 billion in federal loans.
 While the timing was coincidental, the dismal November sales report underscored the perilous financial condition of G.M., the Ford Motor Company and Chrysler. 
 Their combined loan request was substantially higher than the $25 billion that the three companies had initially hoped to get from Congress two weeks ago. 
 The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, said on Tuesday that she had spoken with President Bush by phone on Monday about the need to help the auto industry and that she believed some sort of rescue would be provided, either legislatively or by the Bush administration. 
 ''I think it's pretty clear that bankruptcy is not an option,'' Ms. Pelosi said. But she said that the companies' revamping plans must first pass muster among skeptical lawmakers who sent executives of the Big Three home from Washington empty-handed last month.
 But G.M., the world's largest automaker for decades, said Tuesday that it was in such dire straits that it would deeply cut jobs, factories, brands and executive pay as part of its plea to get $12 billion in federal loans and an additional $6 billion line of credit. G.M. also promised that it could be competitive on labor costs with Toyota by 2012.
 G.M.'s president, Frederick A. Henderson, said the company would be insolvent if it did not receive federal assistance, including an infusion of $4 billion in cash before the end of the year.
 ''Absent support, frankly the company simply can't fund its operations,'' Mr. Henderson said in a call with reporters.
 Chrysler, the smallest of the Detroit companies, is in similar difficulty, and asked Congress for a $7 billion loan before the end of December to ward off a potential bankruptcy.
 Ford said in its plan that it could survive through 2009 with its current cash levels and by tapping its credit line with private banks, and that it could return to profitability by 2011. Even though it is better prepared for the downturn, Ford said it wanted $9 billion in loans to draw upon if necessary. 
 Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said the prospect of a failure of G.M. would cascade through the entire domestic auto industry and put millions of jobs at risk.
 ''We are very, very concerned, and that's why we went with G.M. and Chrysler to Congress even though we think we have sufficient liquidity,'' he said in an interview.
 Mr. Mulally will appear at Congressional hearings Thursday and Friday in Washington along with Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chairman, and Robert L. Nardelli, Chrysler's chairman.
 Together, they will try to persuade lawmakers to act quickly on the loan requests at a special lame-duck session of Congress next week.
 There is only a narrow window for Congress to settle on any aid package for the automakers. Democratic leaders have said that they will not let the debate become a prolonged procedural fight, and they have little interest in keeping lawmakers in town past next Friday.
 Senior Democratic aides say that if a deal cannot be sealed by then, they have little choice but to wait until after the new Congress is sworn in and, if there are still disagreements with the Bush administration, until after Barack Obama's inauguration. 
 Congressional leaders were still reviewing the plans Tuesday. Ms. Pelosi said the companies had clear benchmarks that they needed to meet. 
 ''We want to see a commitment to the future,'' she said. ''We want to see a restructuring of the approach, that they have a new business model, a new business plan. There has to be compensation reform.'' 
 The White House so far has resisted calls for any new taxpayer aid for the automobile industry but instead has pushed for Congressional action to speed up $25 billion in federally subsidized loans that were authorized in an energy bill last year to encourage advanced fuel efficiency.
 But in an apparent hint of flexibility in the Bush administration's stance, Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary, said on Tuesday that the White House would examine the proposals from the automakers.
 ''We'll want to take a look at their plans in detail and see if they meet a credible test for viability,'' Mr. Fratto said. ''We're pleased to see that everyone is now on board with what we've been saying for some time -- that a credible plan for financial viability is necessary if we're even to consider taxpayer assistance.''
 The revelation that G.M. is on the verge of running out of cash will lend new urgency to the discussions.
 While Mr. Henderson declined to say whether G.M. would file for bankruptcy protection if the loans were not approved, he made it clear that in a few weeks' time, the automaker would fall below the minimum levels of cash it needed to operate.
 ''The first $4 billion is crucial,'' he said. ''We wouldn't have asked for the $4 billion if we didn't need it.''
 To make its case for the loans, G.M. said it would make top-to-bottom cuts in its money-losing North American operations. 
 G.M. said it planned to focus on four core brands -- Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC -- and sell, eliminate or consolidate the Saturn, Saab, Hummer and Pontiac brands.
 Despite having downsized its operations in the last three years, G.M. said it would cut more than 20 percent of its remaining jobs, shut nine factories, seek to renegotiate the terms of $66 billion in debt, and push to reopen contract talks with the United Automobile Workers to reduce labor costs. 
 The cutbacks will extend into the executive ranks as well. Mr. Wagoner and G.M.'s board members will reduce their compensation to $1 in 2009, and the company will sell its corporate jets. Despite widespread speculation about Mr. Wagoner's job security, his board gave him another vote of support on Tuesday.
 Mr. Wagoner is scheduled to drive to Washington in a Chevrolet Malibu hybrid vehicle, a concession to criticism from lawmakers who chided the Detroit executives for flying on private aircraft to last month's hearings.
 Mr. Mulally was en route to Washington on Tuesday in a Ford Escape hybrid, and Mr. Nardelli was set to leave drive in one of Chrysler's hybrid S.U.V.'s.
 The criticism from Congress about jet travel and big executive paychecks hit home, Mr. Mulally said during a telephone interview from the road, as he was traveling through the state of Ohio.
 ''Its all part of a learning experience for me,'' he said. ''I think it's really important that I drive to Washington to show that Ford gets what Congress is saying.''
 In their companies' plans, both Mr. Mulally and Mr. Nardelli said they would take $1-a-year salaries if the loan packages were approved. Ford also said it would sell off its corporate aircraft.
 In its plan, G.M. acknowledged ''that it had made mistakes in the past,'' but said its revamping costs since 2006 had consumed ''a substantial portion of its resources.''
 Still, the company said it would have been able to survive on its own if not for the continued deterioration of the United States vehicle market, because of the weakening economy and tight credit, which has made it difficult for consumers who do wander into dealerships to get loans.
 ''The company would not require government assistance were it not for the drastic collapse of the U.S. economy which has devastated the company's current revenues and liquidity,'' G.M. said.
 G.M. said its plan would create a ''new General Motors,'' that will be significantly smaller and more competitive.
 The company said it would sell off its Hummer and Saab brands, shrink its Pontiac brand into a niche vehicle division, and explore opportunities to sell, close or consolidate the Saturn brand that -- when it was started in the 1980s -- was supposed to be G.M.'s answer to the smaller, fuel-efficient cars sold by Japanese competitors.
 G.M. also said it planned to reduce the number of salaried and hourly workers in the United States workers from 96,000 currently, to 65,000 to 75,000 by 2012. It will also reduce its North American factories from 47 to 36, and its dealers from 6,450 and 4,700.
 While it moves to downsize its operations, G.M. is setting up tough negotiations ahead with its bondholders and the U.A.W.
 Mr. Henderson said that G.M. would try to negotiate a reduction in its debt from $66 billion, to about $35 billion. While he would not elaborate, the company was expected to ask bondholders to take equity in exchange for reducing their payout on long-term bonds.
 G.M. will also seek to cut its labor costs by reopening its contract with the U.A.W. Possible cost cuts in the contract include eliminating job security provisions, including the so-called jobs bank that pays idled workers when their plants close. 
 The union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, is scheduled to meet Wednesday with top U.A.W. officials in Detroit to consider how to negotiate the concessions that G.M. says it needs to survive.
 Both Ford and Chrysler will likely want similar concessions from the union.
 Mr. Gettelfinger has said he is willing to go back to the bargaining table to help the companies survive the economic downturn.
 In its request for $7 billion in loans, Chrysler said it would continue to cut costs through negotiations with its suppliers and unions. The company, which is privately owned by Cerberus Capital Management, expects to reduce its structural costs by another $4 billion next year.
 In their plans, all three companies said they would accelerate their timetables to make more fuel-efficient vehicles, with Ford saying for the first time that it would bring out all-electric models within two years.

HEADLINE: Obama Promises Governors That Federal Help Is on the Way

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and IAN URBINA

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
With the economic crisis tearing holes in most state budgets, President-elect Barack Obama promised the nation's governors on Tuesday that he would come to their aid with an ambitious program to build or repair roads, bridges, schools and other public projects.
 Summoning state executives from across the country here, Mr. Obama sought to forge a bipartisan approach to the nation's economic problems. He was met with pleas for a rapid infusion of federal money to create jobs, help those without health coverage and balance recession-ripped budgets. 
 ''To solve this crisis and to ease the burden on our states, we're going to need action, and we're going to need action swiftly,'' Mr. Obama told the governors in the historic Congress Hall, where lawmakers met in the early days of the Republic. ''That means passing an economic recovery plan that helps both Wall Street and Main Street. And this administration does not intend to delay in getting you the help that we need.''
 In a symbolic gesture of partnership with the governors, Mr. Obama plans to announce Wednesday that he has recruited another of their peers for his cabinet. At a news conference in Chicago, Mr. Obama will formally introduce Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico as his choice for secretary of commerce, Democrats close to the process said. Mr. Richardson, a former rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, threw his support to Mr. Obama after dropping out of the race despite intense courting by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and former President Bill Clinton.
 Mr. Richardson will be the second governor elevated this week, after Janet Napolitano from neighboring Arizona was chosen Monday as secretary of homeland security. The commerce slot will be a consolation prize of sorts for Mr. Richardson, who wanted to be secretary of state but lost to Mrs. Clinton.
 Hispanic groups have lobbied strongly on behalf of Mr. Richardson, who would be the only Latino cabinet officer named so far. Activists argue that a surge of Hispanic votes for Mr. Obama helped secure at least four states won by President Bush four years ago: Colorado, Florida, Nevada and New Mexico.
 Mr. Richardson was one of few current or incoming governors not on hand Tuesday at the National Governors Association meeting convened by Mr. Obama. Among those in the hall were Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, and several Republican governors who might run against Mr. Obama in 2012, including Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. Mr. Obama made a point of reaching out to them.
 ''A special message I want to deliver to my Republican colleagues who are here,'' Mr. Obama said, flanked by Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. ''I offer you the hand of friendship, the same commitment to partnership as I do my Democratic colleagues. There is a time for campaigning, and there is a time for governing. And one of the messages that Joe and I want to continually send is that we are not going to be hampered by ideology in trying to get this country back on track.''
 Several governors said they were heartened by Mr. Obama's interest in meeting with them so early. ''He's not going to let us hang in the wind,'' Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, incoming chairman of the Democratic Governors Association, said in an interview afterward. ''And he said, 'This is an introduction, not an ending meeting.' ''
 Other than a visit to the White House, the meeting was Mr. Obama's first appearance outside Chicago since the election. 
 More than 40 states face budget shortfalls now totaling $30 billion and projected to rise to $60 billion by summer, with $120 billion more in spending gaps anticipated in the next fiscal year. Unlike the federal government, most states are required to balance their budgets annually.
 Hoping to shape the economic package Mr. Obama wants to sign soon after taking office, the governors are seeking $136 billion for infrastructure projects already on the books and ready to break ground within months, and $40 billion to cover increased Medicaid costs. In addition to traditional roads and bridges, the projects would include improved medical information technology and expanded broadband Internet capacity.
 ''I've got hundreds of thousands of people in West Virginia who need safe drinking water and sanitation and roads,'' that state's governor, Joe Manchin III, said in an interview. ''That's investment, that's not spending money. We don't want to just throw money at something.''
 Gov. Edward G. Rendell of Pennsylvania, chairman of the National Governors Association, said his colleagues were not ''asking for handouts,'' emphasizing that states were doing their share by cutting spending and financing part of the cost of public works projects. ''We are not asking for this money for ourselves,'' said Mr. Rendell, a Democrat. ''We are asking for it for the citizens of our states.''
 Mr. Obama did not commit to specific aid numbers, but his incoming chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, told reporters on the plane ride back to Chicago that the new president agreed with the thrust of the requests. ''We need to rebuild America,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''We need to build those critical areas today to do it, and an economic recovery act has to do that.''
 Mr. Emanuel said governors of both parties agreed, but a few expressed reservations about the fiscal impact of such spending. ''The main question for some of us is how will going further into debt help the economy with problems that are created by debt,'' said Gov. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a Republican.
 Still, when asked at a news conference whether any would forgo federal money to hold down the deficit, none of the governors present volunteered. 
 ''There is not a governor in this country that would turn down money for roads and bridges and infrastructure projects,'' said Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina, a Democrat. ''The need is simply too great for those sorts of repairs and that work.''

HEADLINE: An Uncommon Resume in an Unusual Time

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks no foreign languages, but has visited 90 countries. She has never negotiated an agreement between two warring sides, but a speech she delivered in Beijing in 1995 is still quoted by women's rights advocates around the world.
 As President-elect Barack Obama's choice for secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton carries a resume that is in many ways thinner than her predecessors. She does not bring the decades of academic and policy expertise that Condoleezza Rice brought to the job, nor does she have Colin L. Powell's military know-how, or even Warren Christopher's past experience as a deputy secretary of state. 
 Nor does she have James A. Baker III's chummy relationship with her boss. Or the street credibility of a Madeleine K. Albright or Henry A. Kissinger, whose very birthplaces -- Prague and Bavaria -- gave them an aura of worldliness that added sheen to their diplomatic credentials.
 And yet, Mrs. Clinton's selection has electrified a diplomatic world where officials can now anticipate the prospect of sitting across a conference table from a former American first lady and presidential candidate, with all of the drama that is attached to the Clinton story. 
 ''When she arrives in a capital city, that city will be riveted,'' said George Friedman, chief executive of Stratfor, a geopolitical risk analysis company. ''The one thing she will have is the undivided attention of any foreign leader she is in a room with.''
 Beyond mere star power, Mrs. Clinton's backers say that her unorthodox background masks diplomatic skills that many of her predecessors in the job did not have. And they dismiss the notion that her inability to order a meal in French means she cannot cajole the European Union to send more troops into Afghanistan.
 ''Look, there are lots of fabulously successful career foreign service officers out there, but first and foremost a secretary of state has to be a person who understands the complexity of the world,'' said Liz Schrayer, director of the Center for U.S. Global Engagement. ''In today's world, the old school of criteria for the job of secretary of state doesn't make the same sense to me as it might have a decade ago.''
 Mrs. Clinton does not, at the moment, have the kind of close working relationship with Mr. Obama that two of the most highly regarded American secretaries of state, Dean Acheson and George Marshall, had with President Harry S. Truman. But neither Acheson nor Marshall began his tenure as Truman's close friend. ''They developed close professional relationships with Truman,'' said Richard C. Holbrooke, the former United States ambassador to the United Nations, ''but they were not his drinking buddies, or part of that poker-playing crowd that sat around at the Sequoia.'' 
 Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Holbrooke said, ''understands global issues, women's rights and public diplomacy, and has watched her husband make war-peace decisions.''
 That last bit -- the idea that Mrs. Clinton received firsthand foreign policy experience via osmosis in her eight years as first lady, was a bone of contention in the Democratic primaries, when Mr. Obama's own foreign policy advisers pooh-poohed Mrs. Clinton's experience. In his news conference on Monday, Mr. Obama shrugged off his own words as bygone.
 With the campaign behind them, advisers to Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton now say the Obama camp exaggerated Mrs. Clinton's lack of foreign policy experience. Mrs. Clinton traveled to 82 countries as first lady, and before heading overseas would often buttonhole White House national security employees. She did not sit in on National Security Council meetings, but she did speak regularly with foreign diplomats and experts, her aides said.
 She pushed to attend a United Nations conference on women in Beijing in 1995, when many Washington critics, within and outside the Clinton administration, argued that her attendance would send the wrong signal, offering China a reward of sorts for improper behavior in the detention of human rights activists. (President Bill Clinton did not visit China until 1998.)
 At the conference, Mrs. Clinton said: ''If there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are women's rights and women's rights are human rights, once and for all.'' More than a decade later, women's rights advocates still refer to those words.
 Mrs. Clinton has an extensive network of foreign contacts from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee, through which she traveled to Iraq and Afghanistan three times, and through her husband. In the Senate, she sometimes used the foreign contacts she developed while at the White House, including picking up the phone to ask Tony Blair, then the British prime minister, to put in a plug at the White House for a defense contract that would benefit New York.
 The biggest question mark on Mrs. Clinton's resume may be whether she can actually negotiate a peace deal -- a requirement for any good secretary of state. Mrs. Clinton has not had to lock warring foreign leaders in a room and bully them into submission, or shuttle between world capitals to prod officials to sign a piece of paper. 
 Mrs. Clinton has praised Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the former NATO commander, and Mr. Holbrooke, an envoy to the Balkans in the Clinton administration, for their conduct of diplomacy, in which both men socialized and drank with Serbia's wartime leader, Slobodan Milosevic, to gauge his strengths. ''You don't learn something from him by pointing at him across the ocean,'' she told The New York Times in an interview this year.
 Philippe Reines, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, said she had worked as a senator to persuade Manhattan entrepreneurs to invest in economic development in upstate New York, and even worked to get Manhattan restaurateurs to use farm products from upstate.

HEADLINE: The Obama Team Takes the Field

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Mr. Obama's Team'' (editorial, Dec. 2):
 It's barely a month since we elected Barack Obama to be our next president. Normally, I wouldn't predict any future president's success before Inauguration Day, but Mr. Obama's decisive and brilliant transition has thus far been dazzling. The judgment, confidence and resolve, which many mistook for arrogance during the campaign, were instrumental to his electoral success.
 Today, in the midst of global crises, Mr. Obama has demonstrated that the stunning stewardship of his campaign wasn't a fluke. He is a pragmatist without the disposition and tolerance for ego, bruised feelings or insecurity in pursuit of his vision. 
 By recreating Abraham Lincoln's ''Team of Rivals'' with a cabinet staffed with the nation's best, including his former presidential rival Hillary Rodham Clinton and the current administration's secretary of defense, Robert M. Gates, Mr. Obama is already fulfilling one vision -- a unified America. 
 If Mr. Obama's pre-inauguration actions predict his entire presidency, history might someday compare Mr. Obama to Lincoln in ways beyond just spearheading cabinets comprised of rivals. Actually, as a Democrat, I am more thrilled that Mr. Obama could possibly be the F.D.R. of my lifetime.

 Denver, Dec. 2, 2008
 To the Editor:
 So this is what change looks like -- Joe Biden, Rahm Emanuel, Tom Daschle, Bill Richardson, Eric Holder, Robert Gates and Hillary Rodham Clinton? What? Were George McGovern and Jimmy Carter unavailable to serve in the new administration?
 O.K. now, everyone please hold hands, close your eyes and repeat after me: I think it's change, I think it's change, I think it's change. Open your eyes when you truly believe. Change we can believe in ... against all evidence to the contrary. Joyce Graham
 Columbia, S.C., Dec. 2, 2008
 To the Editor:
 For President-elect Barack Obama, a less-than-one-term senator, to pick Hillary Rodham Clinton, a slightly-more-than-one-term senator, as secretary of state is hardly cause for the kind of confidence you seem to be brimming with (editorial, Dec. 2).
 Neither of them has any foreign policy experience, a fact that came out in the campaign. She said, correctly, that he didn't have the international experience to take a 3 a.m. crisis call, and her own experience abroad turned out to be mostly in the realm of ceremonial teas and the like. You can't even see Russia from New York, so it's hard to see why the Empire State's junior senator is portrayed as the best choice.
 What Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton both have is celebrity and the facade of statesmanship. What they both lack are the actual accomplishments that come from decades of personal stewardship over large events. 
 Mark Twain said that in statesmanship the formalities were more important than the moralities. He might have added that facade is more appealing than experience. Mark R. Godburn
 North Canaan, Conn., Dec. 2, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Now that the president-elect has named Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and Gen. James L. Jones as his top national security advisers, I hope that he will move up the timeline on Iraq, just as he has done on the economy. By all accounts, Barack Obama's announcements made economic sense.
 My suggestion for the next commander in chief is to immediately meet with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and assign them the task of formulating a withdrawal plan before Jan. 20. This way, on his first day in office, President Obama can sign off on the plan and jump-start the process of ending United States involvement in the war.
 The benefit of having a plan in place sooner rather than later is twofold:
 First, the United States can redirect the billions being spent monthly in Iraq to better uses here at home; and second, we can save American lives.
 Without a doubt, our troops have done everything asked of them in Iraq. Why put any American soldiers at risk one day longer than necessary? Clearly, that doesn't make any military sense at all. Denny Freidenrich

 To the Editor:
 President-elect Barack Obama has demonstrated admirable self-confidence and pragmatism by nominating a national security team with views more conservative than his own, but managing such a team will require Mr. Obama to exercise great caution.
 Republicans were a major presence in John F. Kennedy's national security team, including his defense secretary (Robert McNamara), national security adviser (McGeorge Bundy) and ambassador to Vietnam (Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.). 
 The Republicans in the Kennedy administration played a major role in escalating our involvement in the Vietnam War, a result for which Mr. Kennedy subsequently was blamed by Republican partisans. Richard Joffe

HEADLINE: Write-Downs Hurt Sears and Staples In 3rd Quarter

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Sears Holdings Corporation, the retail chain, said Tuesday that hefty charges and weak results at its department stores and Kmart locations drove it to post a third-quarter loss that was much wider than expected. 
 The retailer withdrew its operating profit outlook because of the severe economic downturn.
 The company, led by the financier Edward S. Lampert, also increased its stock buyback plan.
 Sears reported a loss of $146 million, or $1.16 a share, compared with year-ago profit of $4 million, or 3 cents a share. Excluding hefty write-downs related to 14 store closings and gains on Sears Canada hedges, Sears posted a loss of 90 cents a share in the latest period.
 Revenue dropped 8 percent, to $10.66 billion, from $11.62 billion as Sears same-store sales in the United States slid 10.6 percent and Kmart same-store sales slipped 7 percent. Total same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial retail gauge, fell 9 percent.
 Another retailer, the office supply company Staples, said Tuesday that its third-quarter profit dropped 43 percent because of hefty write-downs from restructuring and the acquisition of the Dutch office supply chain Corporate Express.
 Excluding the charges, the company's results topped Wall Street estimates despite a dip in retail sales.
 Staples said it earned $156.7 million, or 22 cents a share, in the three months ended Nov. 1, down from $274.5 million, or 38 cents a share, a year ago.
 The company said it earned 42 cents a share excluding charges.

HEADLINE: Clinton's Welcome Will Include a Plate of Global Crises

BYLINE: By ETHAN BRONNER; Reporting was contributed by Isabel Kershner from Jerusalem; Taghreed El-Khodary from Gaza; Michael Schwirtz from Moscow; Simon Romero from Lima, Peru; Alexei Barrionuevo from Rio de Janeiro; Charles Newbery from Buenos Aires; Sarah Lyall from London; Elisabeth Malkin from Mexico City; Rachel Donadio from Rome; Sabrina Tavernise from Istanbul; Andrew Jacobs from Beijing; and Michael Slackman and Mona el-Naggar from Cairo.

DATELINE: JERUSALEM 

 BODY:
As a candidate, Hillary Rodham Clinton warned that Iran might be obliterated if it launched a nuclear attack on Israel and that Jerusalem should remain Israel's undivided capital. As a senator, she voted to label Iran's Revolutionary Guards a terrorist organization and to approve President Bush's plan to go to war against Iraq.
 So while Mrs. Clinton's selection to be secretary of state is being scrutinized across the globe -- and generally welcomed -- the view in the Middle East is more complicated. The region expects prompt attention from the incoming administration, a notion that was reinforced when President-elect Barack Obama, in his statement selecting Mrs. Clinton on Monday, specified several crises on her agenda, including the Israeli-Palestinian dispute and the tensions over Iran's nuclear program. 
 In many parts of the world, her selection was greeted with optimism partly borne of an ''anything is better than Bush'' mentality. As Sergei A. Markov, a Kremlin-connected political analyst and a member of Russia's Parliament, put it: ''The most important thing is not who is coming in, but who is leaving.''
 Andreas Etges, a professor in Berlin, made a similar point less sharply, saying, ''There may not be agreement on all policy matters, but with Obama and Hillary Clinton you can at least guarantee a better atmosphere.''
 Many interviewed in more than a dozen countries had high regard for Mrs. Clinton. ''She is an extraordinary woman,'' Yehude Simon, Peru's prime minister, said simply.
 In Europe, the reaction to Mrs. Clinton was mostly positive. Italy's foreign minister, Franco Frattini, said he looked forward to Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration's taking a more multilateral approach to global problems. He says he hopes that the administration asks for a ''greater political commitment'' and more ''cooperation and co-responsibility'' from Europe and that Europe will send more soldiers and money to Afghanistan.
 In the Middle East, the question being debated is whether the once hawkish-sounding Mrs. Clinton will now set a different tone. Would she, as the Obama administration's chief diplomat, focus on negotiating with Iran and coaxing Israel to withdraw from the Golan Heights, to make peace with Syria, and from most of the West Bank and East Jerusalem, to foster the creation of a Palestinian state? Many suspect that she will.
 Raghida Dergham, who writes a column in Al Hayat, the London-based pan-Arab daily, wrote that it was a matter of when, not if, ''negotiations begin between Barack Obama's administration and the government in Tehran,'' and she urged Washington to view the region's problems as interconnected -- ''not to think of Iran regardless of Iraq, or of Syria regardless of Lebanon, or of Israel regardless of Palestine.'' 
 For pro-Western Arabs and liberal Israelis, this is a widely held view: that the moment may be ripe for a grand bargain aimed at stopping Iran's nuclear ambitions and spreading influence. Diplomatic steps would include Israeli territorial withdrawals in exchange for regional recognition. Given Mrs. Clinton's strong pro-Israel credentials, the advocates of this view argue, she could carry it out.
 Cengiz Candar, a political analyst and columnist in Istanbul, made that very point, saying that Mrs. Clinton's selection ''raised hopes in the Middle East that former President Bill Clinton's Mideast peace efforts, which ultimately failed close to the end of his presidency, would be revived'' with new opportunities for peace accords.
 ''There's much more hope that with Hillary Clinton we'll see more active American engagement,'' he said.
 In Israel, some share that hope. Others, who say the Arab world is not ripe for a deal or who want Israel to keep the territory for reasons of security or history, worry precisely about such ambitions. Even some who favor compromise are suspicious of potential pressure. 
 Reactions from Palestinian leaders have been muted. Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said that ''Hillary is a good lady'' and that he hoped she would ''stay on course with the two-state solution.''
 Mahmoud Zahhar, leader of Hamas, the militant party that runs Gaza, seemed to want to leave the door open for a possible softening of Washington's approach by praising her experience and adding, ''For sure it will reflect on international policies.''
 Another kind of reaction -- viewing Mrs. Clinton through the lens of her years as first lady -- produced both positive and negative comments. In Saudi Arabia, Muhammad al-Zulfa, a historian and a member of the Shura Council, which advises the king, said, ''The presence of her husband as the closest man to her can contribute to her perspective on the Middle East.''
 In London, Robin Niblett, a foreign policy scholar, said Europeans, while noting Mrs. Clinton's intelligence and skills, worried about her potentially polarizing political style.
 The official reaction to Senator Clinton's selection was muted in China on Tuesday, with a government spokesman declining to offer an opinion about whether she might alter the course of relations between their countries.
 After mentioning that a congratulatory telegram had been dispatched to Washington, Liu Jianchao, a government spokesman, said that Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi ''was positive in his evaluation of the important progress made in recent years in Sino-U.S. relations and looked forward to working together with them to further push forward Sino-U.S. constructive and cooperative relations.'' 
 Reminded that as a presidential candidate Mrs. Clinton had been critical of China's human rights record and that she had urged President Bush to skip the opening ceremony of the Olympics, Mr. Liu demurred. ''The Beijing Olympics was held successfully and President Bush attended,'' he said flatly.
 Finally, some commentators were adopting a wait-and-see approach. Mexico's former foreign minister, Jorge Castaneda, and Julio Burdman, an Argentine political analyst, said Mrs. Clinton's knowledge of their region and her interest in it remained too vague to judge.
 ''There won't be a big change in relations with Latin America, at least not at first,'' Mr. Burdman said.

HEADLINE: Feud Between City Agencies Delays Moderate-Cost Housing

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ and CHARLES V. BAGLI; David W. Chen contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A dispute inside the Bloomberg administration pitting the city's housing agency against the mayor's budget office has delayed the building of hundreds of homes for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers in economically struggling neighborhoods, city officials, developers and advocates of such housing say. 
 The dispute between the two agencies -- the Department of Housing Preservation and Development and the Office of Management and Budget -- involves the financing of homeownership projects on city-owned land. The housing department is pushing for these projects, while the budget office appears reluctant to spend city dollars in neighborhoods where the housing market is in trouble. 
 As a result, a number of projects have been thrown into limbo, with their financing uncertain and some developers fearful that their projects will be canceled. Those projects include co-ops, condominiums and one- to four-family homes, many in parts of the Bronx and Brooklyn where foreclosure rates are among the highest in the city. 
 Public discord within the administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is relatively rare. This fight also highlights the apparent conflict between two of Mr. Bloomberg's priorities: curbing spending in tight economic times and creating or preserving housing that low- and moderate-income families can afford.
 Developers, nonprofit housing experts and a city official all said that for several months, the budget office had been scrutinizing these projects far more aggressively than in the past and had withdrawn city financing for some projects at the last minute, even after developers had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on designs, land-use applications and other costs. 
 Advocates of the housing projects say that the city has long relied on public dollars to attract developers to neighborhoods like Harlem, Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn and the South Bronx that have had trouble attracting private developers in the past. The budget office's tough approach, these advocates say, is a form of redlining.
 The housing department declined comment. A spokesman for the budget office referred a reporter's call to the mayor's office. 
 A spokesman for the mayor, Andrew Brent, said in a statement that Mayor Bloomberg expected the budget office ''to scrutinize every major financial transaction for every agency, especially when the pressure on the budget is intensified. As we implement the largest affordable-housing plan in the nation, it's critical that we monitor and work to protect areas that are particularly vulnerable.''
 Housing development is one of the mayor's most ambitious undertakings. Mr. Bloomberg is pursuing a plan to create or preserve 165,000 units of housing for low- and moderate-income New Yorkers by 2013. He recently announced that the plan had reached the halfway mark, with more than 82,500 units financed.
 Six advocates for low-income housing have raised their concerns about the budget battle with the deputy mayor for economic development, Robert C. Lieber. In a letter sent to Mr. Lieber in September, the advocates wrote that the budget office's intervention had created ''an atmosphere of uncertainty among developers and investors.'' 
 Mr. Lieber declined to comment. 
 The tougher budget scrutiny caused one nonprofit developer, New York Acorn Housing Company, to delay plans to build 1-, 2- and 3-family homes in the Ocean Hill, Brownsville and East New York sections of Brooklyn. The delay came after the city withdrew its commitment this summer to provide $2.1 million for the project, said Ismene Speliotis, the group's executive director. The 14 homes were to be sold to households earning less than $56,000 for a family of four.
 The land remains vacant, and the group has been forced to make payments on the interest on its predevelopment loan. ''We do not believe this is the right time for the city to say no to these neighborhoods,'' Ms. Speliotis said. ''These lots are sitting there vacant.''
 Another developer, Peter J. Murray, a partner at Loewen Development, spent three years and millions of dollars negotiating a deal with the city and obtaining zoning changes for a series of city-owned parcels at 111th Street and Madison Avenue. He planned to build eight buildings with 207 condos, 87 of which would be set aside for moderate-income families. 
 In order to offset the cost of the lower-priced units, Loewen Development arranged to pay the city $7 for the land -- $1 per lot, the standard price for projects involving subsidized housing on city-owned land.
 But two weeks before he was scheduled to close on his financing in June, Mr. Murray said, he received a call from the housing department telling him that the budget office was insisting that he pay $3 million for the land, Mr. Murray said. 
 ''We had a gun to our head,'' Mr. Murray said. ''A lot of people said to me, 'Walk away.' ''
 Instead, he agreed to pay $2.5 million and continued the project. Mr. Murray said he did so because he was afraid that he would not get another project from the city and because he feared that he would be stuck with a $6 million adjacent parcel on which he could not build.
 ''I've been doing affordable housing in New York City for 15 years, and I have a strong working relationship'' with the housing agency, he said. ''This was a new challenge that we never anticipated.''
 One advocate for low-income housing said hundreds of units in about three dozen projects have been affected by the dispute. Several developers of those projects declined to comment about the status of their projects or to comment about any delays. 
 Mr. Brent, the mayor's spokesman, said about 13 projects were being delayed. ''They're not being canceled,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama Promises Quick Relief for Governors

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama turned from national security to domestic concerns on Tuesday, telling the country's governors that his administration would not delay in pushing an economic recovery plan that would bring relief to the states, 41 of which are forecasting budget shortfalls this year or next. 
 Speaking at a conference of the National Governors Association in Philadelphia, Mr. Obama said his background in the Illinois state senate made him particularly sympathetic to the needs of state and local governments. And he declared himself open to good ideas that work, whether they come from Democrats or Republicans.
 ''We are not going to be hampered by ideology in trying to get this country back on track,'' he told the governors, many of whom he met for the first time at the conference. ''We want to figure out what works.'' Vice President-elect Joseph Biden Jr. also attended the meeting.
 Aides to Mr. Obama have suggested that a recovery plan, which the president-elect hopes to be able to sign not long after taking office on Jan. 20, might carry a price tag of as much as $700 billion.
 But even as the president-elect spoke on Tuesday, the dimensions of the challenges facing him at home and abroad continued to grow more stark. The three American automakers were due to announce more weak results and detail their revamped requests for federal aid during the day, while overseas, the terror attack in Mumbai, renewed violence in Iraq and difficult conditions in Afghanistan further darkened the picture.
 In dealing with the worsening climate that faces state governments, many of them now obliged to balance their budgets by cutting jobs and programs, Mr. Obama asked the governors not just for their support but for their input in drafting a national recovery plan. 
 ''To solve this crisis and to ease the burden on our states, we need action, and action swiftly,'' he said. ''That means passing an economic recovery plan to help both Wall Street and Main Street, and this administration does not intend to delay in getting you the help that you need.''
 The importance of the federal help Mr. Obama offered was underscored on Monday when Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California declared a fiscal emergency in his state and urged lawmakers to ''get off of their rigid ideologies'' to close a $28 billion budget gap. He said the state could run out of cash within two months.

HEADLINE: Adolfo Carrion Jr.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
As he prepares to take office, President-elect Barack Obama is relying on a small team of advisers who will lead his transition operation and help choose the members of his administration. Following is part of a series of profiles of potential members of the administration. 
 Name:Adolfo Carrion Jr.
 Being considered for: A senior position in the administration, possibly housing and urban development secretary
 Would bring to the job: A passion for urban planning issues and a dozen years' experience in politics and policy as a member of the New York City Council and, later, as the Bronx borough president. He would be a popular selection among Hispanic officials, who have applauded his work as president of the National Association of Latino Elected Officials.
 Is linked to Mr. Obama by: His active support for the president-elect's candidacy, campaigning coast to coast for him, particularly in states with large Hispanic populations. 
 Carries as baggage: Not much, apart from the fact that he has little experience at the federal level. He is widely respected for having remained above the fray in the fractious politics of the Bronx, but he has few, if any, truly close friends among the borough's politicians. 
 In his own words:''The persistent bad news is that poverty and all its related issues remains a problem that grips still too many in our community. You and I know that this is the result of decades of bad public policy and the absence of a sensible urban agenda for our country. We can't keep throwing money at a housing policy that concentrates poor families in massive housing projects and hopes for the best. We can't keep wishing kids into success by simply declaring that no child will be left behind. We must stop treating the poor as laboratory subjects that we tinker with in our pricey think tanks and universities. We will eradicate poverty by investing in our most important asset: our children and families.'' (Speech in 2007)
 Used to work as: A specialist in the New York City Department of City Planning. He was once vice president of human services and community outreach at Promesa, a community development organization in the Bronx.
 Is otherwise known for: Being a pretty good singer (he sang the Puerto Rican anthem, ''La Borinquena,'' at his City Council swearing-in ceremony). His father is a Pentecostal minister, and Mr. Carrion himself served for a time as an associate pastor at a Bronx church. He also worked as a middle school teacher.
 Biography: Born March 6, 1961, in Manhattan ... family moved to the Bronx when he was in fourth grade ... graduated from Kings College, in Westchester County, N.Y., where he majored in world religions ... master's degree in urban planning from Hunter College ... lives with his wife, Linda, on City Island in the Bronx; they have three daughters and one son.

HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students consider the phenomenon of Black Friday and then research and debate the idea that Americans are "programmed" to shop. 

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students consider the phenomenon of Black Friday and then research and debate the idea that Americans are "programmed" to shop.
Suggested Time Allowance: One to two class periods
Activities / Procedures:
1. WARM-UP/DO NOW:
Students respond to the following quotation from Mad magazine: "The only reason a great many American families don't own an elephant is that they have never been offered an elephant for a dollar down and easy weekly payments."
Ask: What do you think the speaker is trying to say about American consumers? Do you agree or disagree with this statement? What are your observations about how and why we shop as a culture? As individuals? Then expand the conversation to the phenomenon of Black Friday, the biggest shopping day of the year. Ask: How does this statement make sense in the context of Black Friday? Why do you think would someone would get up at 5 a.m. to go shopping on the day after Thanksgiving? Have you ever shopped on Black Friday? Why or why not? What are your observations or experiences with this shopping day? What dominant images come to your mind when you think of this day?
Wrap up by telling students that they are going to read a news article that examines Black Friday in 2008 in light of the economic recession and a death that was caused by a stampede of shoppers.
 
2. ARTICLE QUESTIONS:
As a class, read and discuss the article "A Shopping Guernica Captures the Moment," focusing on the following questions:
- What iconic images or scenes of the past century does the writer, Peter S. Goodman, evoke in his description of Black Friday? What is the purpose?
- Who does the author say is responsible for the phenomenon of Black Friday? Does he think it is a positive or negative aspect of American culture? Why?
- What special significance did this year's Black Friday hold for shoppers, businesses and even policy makers?
- To what does the writer compare the American economy? Do you agree or disagree with this simile?
- What has the government's position been on spending in recent years?
- What is the challenge facing American consumers right now?
- Why do you think the article's headline includes a reference to the Picasso painting "Guernica"? What does that suggest?
 
3. ACTIVITY:
Tell students that they are going to debate the following argument made in Mr. Goodman's article: "For decades, Americans have been effectively programmed to shop. China, Japan and other foreign powers have provided the wherewithal to purchase their goods by buying staggering quantities of American debt. Financial institutions have scattered credit card offers as if they were takeout menus and turned our houses into A.T.M.'s. Hollywood and Madison Avenue have excelled at persuading us that the holiday season is a time to spend lavishly or risk being found insufficiently appreciative of our loved ones."
The specific question will be: "Are we 'effectively programmed' to shop?" Divide students into two groups. Assign one side the "pro" position and the other the "con" position.
Have students use the "Buy Buy Holidays" handout to collect evidence for or against the idea that we are programmed to shop. Direct students to think about consumer culture and Americans' buying habits in the context of the recession, focusing on how and why we shop as a culture, considering both needs (food, clothing, etc.) and desires (luxury and other unnecessary items), as well as how people generally split their actual purchases along these lines. How much do we buy necessities versus indulgences? Do advertisements and other cultural forces persuade people that a "want" is actually a "need"?
Once students have compiled their arguments and evidence, regroup and moderate an in-class debate. Ask each student group to begin with a 60- to 90-second statement, starting with a quote that encapsulates their argument. Wrap up by having students discuss how their views on holiday shopping and Black Friday have changed or stayed the same.
4. FOR HOMEWORK OR FUTURE CLASSES:
Individually, have students read Andrew Revkin's Dot Earth blog post "Black Friday: Buy Nothing or Make Something?" It asks consumers to consider the merits of buying locally made gifts or crafting presents themselves, given the recent death on Black Friday and the recession.
After they read the post, have students write paragraphs addressing the following question: "What have you made or fixed that provides at least a hint of self-sufficiency, thrift or environmental integrity?" Then have them create a list of do-it-yourself gifts they would like to receive or might be able to make, even something as simple as holiday cards or baked goods.
In a future class or project, have students pick one item from their list and create it, build it or cook it. Host a D.I.Y. holiday fair or exhibit in your classroom where students shop using a barter system.

HEADLINE: Which Side Are You On?

BYLINE: SUZANNE VEGA


HIGHLIGHT: The songs we choose to listen to, or record, can mark us as members of a particular tribe. 

 BODY:
In the last few months I have had a chance to review a song I wrote in October of 2007. It's called "Daddy Is White," and I haven't sung it out loud yet in front of an audience except to record a demo of it. My daughter worries that people might make fun of me. However, I feel that it is a truthful song. 
In my last blog post I mentioned that I was raised in a half-Puerto Rican family and spent five years in East Harlem as a young child. At some point, when I was about 9 years old, I learned that my birth father was actually English-Scottish-Irish. Or white, as we used to say in my old neighborhood. Actually, anybody looking at me could probably tell that this was the case, but I felt I was the last to know, partly because I was treated by my Puerto Rican abuelita and my aunt and uncle as one of their own. I was proud, and still am proud, to be a Vega. 
One person wrote in after my last blog entry to ask whether I had any plans to record Puerto Rican songs or songs in Spanish as a way of honoring those roots. I thought about this, but have to say no, even though I have had experience singing songs in Spanish. One of my first performing jobs was with a group called The Alliance of Latin Arts. I was 15 years old, and it was a government sponsored job, where we traveled from borough to borough singing songs in Spanish, like "La Bamba." I attracted attention wherever I went, and it wasn't because of my singing. (Somewhere in storage in a folder marked "scrapbook" I have a flyer from that job - when I find it I will post it here.) If you could look at the photo, you would see one girl in the line of dark-skinned Latinas to the far right looking down, and that is me, sticking out as usual. 
It always struck me that in this picture I look like I am not only of a different race, but of a different century, as though I were Emily Dickinson and had somehow wandered into the Bronx in the 1970's. (It should be noted that Puerto Ricans are not of one race - there are blue-eyed blond Puerto Ricans, though I never actually met any until recently.) I feel it would be false of me to do an album of Puerto Rican songs, since pretending I fit in, even back then, always felt a bit forced. 
Songs brand us a part of a tribe. We can pick and choose what tribe we belong to. Goth, emo, hippie, punk, folk, alternative, for example. "Mom! Why are you wearing all black?" my daughter recently shouted at me. "You look so emo!" "I always wear black," I mumbled. "But we are at the beach!" she said. Well, maybe she had a point.
I am of Irish descent, among other things, but I feel it would be false of me to perform traditional Irish music, even though I find some of it very moving. When I worked with Mitchell Froom, I liked that he said, "I will reveal you to be the mutant you really are!" when he heard how I grew up and about the mixed bag of stuff I grew up listening to - from Woody Guthrie and Phil Ochs to Motown, Lou Reed, Leonard Cohen and Bob Dylan. But perhaps one day I could do an album of Jewish folk songs in A-minor, or an album of cante jondo, which Federico Garcia Lorca wrote of; this would take guts. I love sad and tragic songs, and I love the sensuality of Brazilian bossa nova; perhaps my melancholic temperament could do justice to an album like this.
I remember walking down the street one day, wearing a Smiths t-shirt, back in the mid-'80s. I was headed for the subway station, and I had to pass through a crowd of black teenagers to get there. There were maybe eight or so young men, looking me up and down as I picked my way through them. My neck prickled with worry. What would they say? Would they call me a goofy white girl, or worse? 
One of them snickered. My stomach dropped. Then another one sang out, "I am human and I need to be loved!! Just like everybody else does!!" Morrissey's transcendental lyrics from "How Soon Is Now?" It was so unexpected that I burst out laughing. They knew the song! Then we all laughed, and the tension was broken. Maybe we were the same tribe after all.
This song is called "Daddy Is White," and I don't know what tribe it represents. Maybe you also thought your daddy was Puerto Rican, and then you turned out to have another father! The song doesn't even apply to my brothers and sister, whose daddy really was Ed Vega, who is shown here at the dining room table with the family guitar. However, the second and third verses were also drawn from reality - the second verse applies to the neighborhood I live in, where if you walk anywhere you run into the projects, where you can still feel those prickles, and feel all eyes on you: "What is she doing here?"
In the weeks following the recent election, though, there has been a very different feeling in the air in these neighborhoods, a feeling of relief, of recognition, of pride. There is going to be a man in the White House (Barack Obama) whose mother was white and whose father was black. He was a mixed-race child; he is a black man. His family is multicultural, as mine is. What a relief to see this represented in the realities of power and politics! In the media! 
 We say these words out loud and in print. Black, white. When I recorded the demo of this song earlier this year my engineer and I discussed what the song was about. At one point I realized we were whispering those words. Now we say them out loud, and they reflect our reality. It matters.
The last verse was inspired by a real-life discussion I overheard at a bar in Baltimore. A black man and a white woman were discussing a recent sports event. He called her "baby" playfully. She called him "stats boy," meaning, I guess, someone well-versed in statistics. The conversation escalated quickly into a loud yelling argument, as he did not feel he was a boy of any kind and that word had racist overtones. Maybe the recent election means my song is on its way to being obsolete. I hope so.
 Daddy Is White (By Suzanne Vega, 2007) 
I am an average white girl who comes from Upper Manhattan.
And I am totally white, but I was raised half Latin.
This caused me some problems among my friends and my foes,
Cause when you look into my face, it's clear what everybody else knows:
Chorus:
My daddy is white.
So I must be white too.
When you look into the mirror, what
Comes looking back at you?
If your daddy is white,
You must be white too.
When you look into the mirror
what comes looking back at you?
I feel it in the city when I take a walk uptown
I feel the tension in the air, I feel it ticking all around,
I feel it filling up the sidewalk, in the spaces in between,
Between my face and your face in public places where we get seen.
Chorus
He called her baby. She called him boy, and then it started.
They were strangers at the bar, and they both ended broken hearted.
And it was a conversation, but it ended as a fight.
And I can tell you it's because he was black, and she was white.
Suzanne Vega, a singer and songwriter whose success in the 1980s helped establish the acoustic folk-pop movement, has released eight albums, including the platinum-selling "Solitude Standing" (1987) with the hit single "Luka" and the 2007 recording "Beauty and Crime" on Blue Note Records. She is also the author of a book of poetry and was a host of the public radio series "American Mavericks." Her Web site is suzannevega.com.

HEADLINE: What's in a Name? A Mets-Citi Bond

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR. 
E-mail: sportsbiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
When Citigroup bought the rights to put its name on the Mets' new ballpark two years ago, the global financial giant and some of its top executives were quite familiar to Fred Wilpon, the principal owner of the Mets and a real estate developer.
 Lewis B. Kaden, a Citi vice chairman, was in private legal practice when he counseled the Mets during the 1994-95 players' strike. He later represented Wilpon in his contentious buyout of the team from his former partner, Nelson Doubleday. Citi was also a banker for the team and eventually the lead underwriter of the bonds for the new ballpark. 
 Wilpon's friends also include Sanford I. Weill, who created Citigroup as a financial services supermarket, and Charles O. Prince III, who resigned under pressure as chairman last year as the economy started to crater and Citi's profits began to erode.
 The Mets turned to Citi, not Bank of America or JPMorgan Chase, reasoning that as a New York-based company with global scope, it would covet the 20-year, $400-million deal, which could be extended by 15 years, and be able to keep a competitor out.
 For a company with $89 billion in revenue in 2006, what was $20 million a year?
 ''We are convinced that Citigroup has just won the World Series of sports sponsorships,'' Kaden said at the November 2006 news conference to announce the agreement -- a day when the company's stock closed at $50.69 a share (it traded below $8 last week). ''We love the Mets.''
 Only a month earlier, Citi announced quarterly net profits of $5.5 billion.
 Two years later, Citi has lost tens of billions of dollars and laid off tens of thousands of its employees because of systemic problems that were lurking as Citi celebrated its deal with the Mets. Kaden -- a friend of Robert E. Rubin, a Citi director and a former Treasury secretary -- oversaw the work of the company's former senior risk officer. And The New York Times reported that the risk officer did not properly police trading and lending excesses.
 Last week, the government came to Citi's rescue with a stabilization plan that includes backing $306 billion in mostly real estate assets, agreeing to absorb potential losses on that portfolio, as well as buying $20 billion in Citi preferred stock.
 Banks are well represented in the universe of naming rights -- from Bank of America and Wachovia to Chase, Citizens Bank and TD Banknorth -- but those deals did not go into effect during a dire economy or cost nearly as much as the record sum that Citi is paying (which was matched by Barclays in its deal for the Nets' arena in Brooklyn).
 Without falling into bankruptcy, Citi could not seek to abrogate its deal. It was only in federal bankruptcy court that the Houston Astros got the name of the felonious energy company Enron off its stadium, but it cost them a $2.1 million buyout fee.
 The Mets are standing by Citi, and Citi is standing by the Mets.
 ''It's a binding agreement,'' Kaden said in a brief interview, ''and a good deal'' that still fits Citi's local and global marketing and philanthropic goals.
 The Mets want Citi to stay alive and healthy. Given the economy, it is unlikely that another company would pay close to Citi's $20 million. The team would not be so charitable as to let Citi walk if Citi pleads that it needs to conserve cash. The Mets and Citi do not want the stadium to be known as The Ballpark Formerly Called Citi Field.
 During a tour of Citi Field on Tuesday, Jeff Wilpon, the Mets' chief operating officer, said it was ''good business and the morally right thing for both of our companies to be together and for us to help Citi and for Citi to help us.'' He defended Citi's need to continue to sell itself. ''The day they stop advertising,'' Wilpon said by telephone. ''It's like McDonald's stops and Burger King passes you buy.'' 
 Last year, Citi spent $2.9 billion on advertising and marketing.
 The propriety of Citi's record naming rights deal starting just as it needs a huge federal safety net poses a serious public relations challenge, especially if it is perceived that taxpayers are financing the naming rights.
 ''The public has its nose in the air about this kind of stuff,'' said Charles Geisst, a financial historian and professor at Manhattan College. ''Whether or not the naming rights money is coming from taxpayers or not, it looks like it does.''
 Robert Passikoff, the president of the research firm Brand Keys, said its study of customer loyalty to banks, surveyed in September, showed Citi last among the seven assessed.
 ''It's bad karma,'' he said of the deal between Citi and the Mets. ''What can the Mets do about it? More to the point, it's what Citi needs to do. I see a lot of free tickets in customers' futures.''
 If the economic crisis eases and Citi does not need more propping up, the naming rights flap might fade. Citi should help that along by educating fans and expanding the community relations programs that are part of the naming rights deal.
 Steve Greenberg, a managing director at Allen & Company, who brokered the deal for the Mets, said the deal had generated considerable attention for Citi. 
 ''It's probably overdelivered on what the naming deal would do for marketing and exposure,'' he said. ''And that's before ESPN ever says, 'Now to the action at Citi Field.' ''

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Is Urged to Speed Reviews on Risk

BYLINE: By CORNELIA DEAN

 BODY:
The Environmental Protection Agency must revise its approach to assessing environmental health hazards and other risks, because current practices hinder useful and timely regulation, an expert panel of The National Research Council says.
 The council, the research arm of the National Academy of Sciences, said the agency should scrap some of the assumptions on which its decisions have been based and reduce its focus on individual chemicals and other hazards to consider how they act in combination. It should also accept that uncertainty was always an issue and seek to provide practical information to policy makers as quickly as possible.
 The report, which the panel produced at the behest of the E.P.A., was made public Wednesday and is online at www.nas.edu. 
 Determining whether something is a hazard and, if so, how great and to whom is a crucial step in devising appropriate environmental regulations, the panel said, and the field is advancing as testing systems and other technology advance. 
 But assessing environmental risks is highly complex and full of uncertainty, it continued, and at the E.P.A., ''the regulatory risk-assessment process is bogged down,'' with some assessments taking a decade or more. For example, the report cited an assessment of trichloroethylene, a commonly used solvent, that has been under way since the 1980s and is not expected before 2010. 
 The environmental agency's conclusions about risk are usually crucial in establishing regulatory goals. As a result, they are often subject to intense political or economic pressure. When the Bush administration proposed changes that it said would streamline risk-assessment procedures, critics called the proposal an effort to weaken environmental regulation. In a 2007 report, the academy dismissed the proposal as ''fundamentally flawed,'' and it was withdrawn.
 Thomas A. Burke, an epidemiologist at the Bloomberg School of Public Health at Johns Hopkins University, said the new report focused on the use of ''defaults,'' assumptions that are made about one factor or another in the face of uncertainty.
 ''Many of them are founded on good science,'' he said, ''but there are some hidden assumptions. Right now, when we don't have information on a pollutant, we treat it as if there's no risk. That's a so-called hidden default.'' 
 Dr. Burke added, ''We really need to address these gaps.''
 Another issue the report cited was the effect of cumulative exposures to a variety of environmental hazards. Usually these hazards are studied one by one. But Dr. Burke said, ''You have to consider not just the one compound but you have to ask broadly, because people are exposed to many, many thousands of substances.'' 
 A spokesman for the American Chemical Society said it would have no comment on the report until members had had time to read it.
 Joel Tickner, a professor of environmental health at the University of Massachusetts at Lowell who studies chemicals in the environment, said that while he had not seen the report, its focus on speeding environmental review and consideration of cumulative effects was overdue. 
 ''We put a lot of effort into finding more complex ways to characterize the problems while we don't put nearly as much resources into studying solutions,'' Professor Tickner said. 
 He, too, cited trichloroethylene, saying, ''Given that we know trichloroethylene is a neurotoxin and a carcinogen and that there are very good alternatives, it makes no sense to put so much resources into studying it.'' 
 Professor Tickner said that by focusing on safer alternatives for processes like degreasing, industries in Massachusetts had reduced their use of the compound by 90 percent. 
 ''But as long as we are uncertain, we assume there is no problem,'' he said. ''That provides almost an incentive to having scientific uncertainty.''

HEADLINE: At Shubert, The Future Has Roots In the Past

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
The ascension of Philip J. Smith and Robert E. Wankel to the top of the Shubert Organization Tuesday night ended a 20-plus-year guessing game about the future of the largest theater-owning enterprise in the nation.
 Back in the late 1980s, when Bernard Jacobs, the president of Shubert, became seriously ill, the theater world started buzzing about who would eventually succeed him and Gerald Schoenfeld, the pair who had helped save Broadway from ruin in the 1970s when the company was in disarray and President Gerald R. Ford, in other words, told a bankrupt New York City to drop dead. 
 When Mr. Jacobs died in 1996 at the age of 80, worries heightened about who would take over after Mr. Schoenfeld. For the next 12 years the lack of a succession plan was a regular topic of conversation. 
 As it turns out, there was a plan, though it pretty much lacked the high drama and mystery that decades of speculation had invested in it. When Mr. Schoenfeld died last week at 84, the next two men in line, who together have nearly 90 years of experience at Shubert, were asked by the board of directors to move up a step. 
 ''The board has voted for continuity,'' said Rocco Landesman, the president of the rival Jujamcyn Theaters. ''It seems the feeling was, as we're heading for stormy seas, you better have experienced hands on the wheel.''
 He was talking about the recession, which has contributed to the closing of nine Broadway shows in the last few months, and the prospect of shuttered theaters by the end of next year.
 What Tuesday's selection also shows, though, is that however much Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Schoenfeld hauled financial and management operations into the modern era, Shubert retains the characteristics of a family business, run by a small circle of men. Though not part of the original family, Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Schoenfeld learned the trade through years of apprenticeship to J. J. Shubert. They, in turn, tutored Mr. Smith, 77, and Mr. Wankel, who turns 62 on Friday.
 The six-member board, which has ultimate control of the company and the foundation that owns it, are like a council of elders conferring rites of passage.
 ''In the tradition of guaranteeing the future of the Shubert Organization, J. J. Shubert brought us a 32-year-old Gerald Schoenfeld in 1957, and later Bernard Jacobs,'' said James Freydberg, a longtime producer. ''Schoenfeld and Jacobs brought us two extraordinary talents in Phil Smith and Bob Wankel.''
 Yet as Mr. Freydberg noted, concerns about the future persist. ''I would hope that these two current Shuberts, in due course, will see a way to hire and train younger talent, ensuring the future and securing the legacy of the Shubert Organization, because that is absolutely vital to the industry.''
 Mr. Smith, who was named chairman of the Shubert Organization and the foundation, was given the same titles that Mr. Schoenfeld held, while Mr. Wankel was named president. Still, the announcement emphasized the idea of a partnership, with both men named co-chief executive officers. ''We'll confer with each other,'' Mr. Smith said. ''Those in the organization have always worked very closely with each other. Really nothing has changed in that sense.''
 The duo are acknowledged masters of the business side. What industry observers wonder is whether there is also creative theatrical vision. One way that Mr. Schoenfeld and especially Mr. Jacobs revived Broadway in the 1970s was to invest, produce and co-produce shows to fill empty theaters. ''Cats,'' ''Ain't Misbehavin' '' and ''Dreamgirls,'' and plays like ''Glengarry Glen Ross'' and ''The Heidi Chronicles'' were among their credits. And while most were chosen with an eye on ticket sales, they occasionally championed a show simply because they thought it deserved to be produced, like Stephen Sondheim's ''Sunday in the Park With George.''
 Now Broadway is coming off some of its fattest years, but people look to Shubert to take the lead if the industry slumps and theaters go dark.
 The leader of Shubert is ''the face of the American theater to the world,'' Mr. Landesman said. He noted that Mr. Smith was a much more private person than the convivial Mr. Schoenfeld. ''He's going to have to step up there.'' Still, he warned not to underestimate the new leadership. Handicapping shows is as important as producing, he said, and Mr. Smith's judgment could be relied upon. ''Phil wanted 'Jersey Boys','' he noted, referring to the blockbuster hit that Shubert passed on and is now, to Mr. Landesman's delight, residing in a Jujamcyn theater. 
 Asked about investing and producing, particularly in a downturn, Mr. Smith said, ''We'll do everything.'' 
 While a Shubert affiliation seems to bestow longevity (the eldest board member is 94) speculation over future successions is inevitable. The organization's secretive workings have been compared to the Soviet-era Kremlin. If so, then it is hard not to be reminded of Yuri Andropov and other elder party bosses who served between the end of the Brezhnev era and Mikhail Gorbachev's regime. In that sense the choices that Mr. Wankel and Mr. Smith make about the executive officers they'll bring with them should be telling. 
 Theater people won't have to wait long; personnel moves are coming soon, Mr. Smith said. 
 Let the speculation begin -- again.

HEADLINE: The Hunt Is On For New Money

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and JOHN FOLEY

 BODY:
Financial institutions from Morgan Stanley to GE Capital are trying to beef up their deposit gathering. Goldman Sachs is even considering starting an online bank. But they may find their dash for retail dollars isn't a panacea.
It's no surprise financial firms find deposits enticing. Alternative sources of funds, like the market for commercial paper, are drying up. So institutions that relied heavily on it must turn elsewhere. Deposits, on the other hand, are cheaper and traditionally more stable than short-term debt raised in the capital markets.
But they have their limits. For instance, regulations prohibit banks from using deposits to finance activities like trading. Goldman, say, could finance only about $130 billion of its trillion-dollar balance sheet with deposits. 
That's a lot more than the $20 billion of deposits it currently holds, but the regulatory constraints mean deposits will be only an aid, not a complete solution, to Wall Street's funding needs.
There's also the danger that the increasing demand for deposits makes them more expensive and less stable. There's already evidence that competition is affecting prices: The average interest rate for a one-year U.S. certificate of deposit is around 3.3 percent, about the same as it was six months ago.
Yet the Federal Reserve has reduced its target overnight rate to 1 percent, from 2 percent, over that period, and interbank lending rates have fallen.
That means, on a relative basis, banks are paying more to attract some of the $7.2 trillion pool of American deposits.
Competition could also reduce the ''stickiness'' of deposits, because a wider range of yields on bank accounts and certificates of deposit will prompt consumers to shop around. In fact, Main Street may turn out a bigger winner than Wall Street as banks vie to bring in new money.
A Refinance Squeeze
The dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster chose ''bailout'' as its word of the year for 2008. Next year's might be ''refinance.'' Companies worldwide have $4 trillion of debt due to be repaid or renewed in the next 18 months. Working out what to do with that sum -- roughly equivalent to Japan's annual economic output -- looks to be the next phase of the global financial crisis.
In normal times, companies have two options when debt payback looms. In Europe, most turn to their banks. That route isn't closed, but it has narrowed since banks fell into crisis. Some lenders have failed or merged, reducing available lending. All of them are trying to cut the number of loans they have outstanding.
Where banks are lending, the loans are more expensive even for borrowers with strong credit. Less robust customers have an unenviable choice: come back next year, or don't come back at all.
The other option, usually more popular in the United States, is the bond market. Companies that can do so have been rushing to issue bonds. But they are paying higher interest rates than they used to.
There are other glitches. One is that only companies with a bond market track record and an investment-grade rating are palatable to investors. In November, there wasn't a single sub-investment grade corporate bond issued, according to Thomson Reuters, the first such hiatus since March 1991.
Another problem is that bond issuers have stiff competition for investors' attention. Governments have guaranteed swaths of bank debt to dig the financial system out of a hole. With around $3.6 trillion of government guarantees given out in the last two months, normal corporate borrowers could be crowded out of the market.
For those that can't borrow on terms they can afford, an uncertain future awaits. Some will try to raise equity, though stock market gyrations make that a nail-biting prospect. Others could issue convertible securities, essentially debt with equity characteristics. Such instruments are suited to volatile times, but they can prove expensive.
Perhaps the lending drought will self-correct. If companies pay high enough interest rates, income-oriented investors will become interested and banks may ramp up lending, too. After all, when companies go to the wall, lenders are left unpaid or forced to take equity in place of their loans. Something has to give before then, or the crisis may well pass back to the banks themselves.

HEADLINE: An Online Boom That May Not Last

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
In a rare bright spot for the retail industry, e-commerce sites had a strong holiday weekend, with online sales from Friday through Monday up 13 percent compared with last year, according to data released Wednesday by comScore. 
 The Monday after Thanksgiving was the second-heaviest online spending day on record, comScore said, behind only Dec. 10, 2007. Online sales climbed to $846 million, up 15 percent from the previous year. 
 ''It was higher than I would have anticipated, but I'm not entirely surprised, just because the level of discounting was so aggressive,'' said Andrew Lipsman, a senior industry analyst at comScore, which tracks a variety of Internet data. 
 Still, strong Web sales are unlikely to bail out the retail industry, which is contending with a recession and a sharp decline in consumers' wealth. E-commerce now accounts for only 7 percent of overall sales, according to Shop.org, the e-commerce arm of the National Retail Federation. And online sales were down 2 percent for the season so far -- the first decline since the Web became a significant retail channel. 
 The Monday after Thanksgiving -- which Shop.org calls Cyber Monday -- has been a bellwether for online holiday sales. Sales growth on that day has historically fallen within two percentage points of total online sales growth for the season. 
 This year will be a different story, Mr. Lipsman said. ComScore has predicted that sales will be flat this season, and the firm is not changing its forecast as a result of sales Monday. 
 ''There was evidently some pent-up demand,'' said Scott Silverman, executive director of Shop.org. ''The consumer could have said, 'I'm going to do most of my shopping this day,' and we could see a drop-off for the rest of the season.'' 
 The online sales growth over the weekend mirrored offline sales, which the National Retail Federation said increased 18 percent over last year. Many retailers will give precise figures Thursday in their November sales reports.
 Online, the virtual big-box stores, which had some of the steepest discounts, got the most visits. On Monday, eBay, Amazon, Wal-Mart, Target and Best Buy were the top e-commerce sites, Nielsen Online said. 
 At PayPal, which is used to process almost all eBay sales, the number of transactions Monday was up 27 percent from the year before, said Jim Griffith, whom eBay calls its marketplace expert. To lure shoppers, the auction site is promoting $1 holiday ''doorbusters.''
 The most popular product sold on eBay Monday was the Nintendo Wii game console -- 3,017 were sold for an average price of $349. The Wii Fit, an add-on device for the console, was also popular, with 1,305 units sold for an average $143. 
 Amazon.com had strong sales of consumer electronics and toys, said Sally Fouts, a spokeswoman for the company. Deals included a Logitech universal remote control, marked down to $137.28 from $249.99, and a Canon digital camera, down to $159.94 from $299.99. 
 Beauty products accounted for a surprisingly large slice of sales Monday, said Sucharita Mulpuru, an e-commerce analyst at the research firm Forrester. ''Cosmetics are doing really well this year, because it's those affordable luxuries,'' she said. 
 Average order values have been smaller this year, Ms. Mulpuru said: ''It may not be a sweater, but it's a scarf.'' 
 One reason that shoppers finally filled their online shopping carts might be that there are five fewer shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year than last. ''People have to spend a certain amount of money during Christmas,'' Ms. Mulpuru said, ''and that money was not spent in November, which means it has to be spent in December.''

HEADLINE: Sundance Tilts to Films That Tug At the Heart

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
If things turn out as expected, festivalgoers will have more to cry about than the room prices at Sundance next year.
 The programmers of the Sundance Film Festival on Wednesday announced a schedule of competition films that in their view, reflect an unusual tilt toward the emotional -- maybe even melodramatic -- side of independent cinema. 
 The festival, Sundance's 25th, is scheduled for Jan. 15 to 25 in Park City, Utah. (A full list of the competition films can be found at nytimes.com/carpetbagger.) 
 ''Audiences this year are going to be surprised,'' Geoffrey Gilmore, the director of the festival, said this week in a far-ranging discussion of the mood and makeup of the 2009 program. ''The range of emotions evoked by the films is going to be greater than in the past.''
 Mr. Gilmore even described one of the films selected, ''The Greatest,'' about a family dealing with the loss of a teenage son, as being ''three-hankie, if not more.'' Written and directed by Shana Feste, it stars Pierce Brosnan and Susan Sarandon.
 The festival's flavor is also going to be a bit more international. Submissions from the United States fell, after years of steady increases, to 1,905 feature-length films, from 2,021 in 2008, while foreign submissions rose to 1,756, from 1,603. The 118 features selected (including noncompetition films still to be announced) were chosen from 3,661 submissions, up slightly from 3,624, despite a weakening independent movie market.
 ''It hasn't dropped the way it will drop, which I can tell you is certain to happen,'' Mr. Gilmore said of the submissions pool and its probable future erosion by the continuing financial crisis.
 Mr. Gilmore and John Cooper, the festival's director of programming, noted that many entries stepped across national boundaries, as filmmakers -- American and otherwise -- tackled stories and themes that connected with worlds beyond their borders, often with financing from far-flung sources.
 Thus the French-born writer and director Sophie Barthes, who got her start with a Ukrainian-language short, ''Zimove Vesilya,'' made ''Cold Souls'' with Paul Giamatti, in New York and St. Petersburg, Russia, with some backing from Arte France Cinema. The movie concerns an American actor's exploration of what the promotional materials describe as ''soul extraction.''
 Another exercise in filmmaking without borders is ''Sin Nombre,'' which has Mexican backing and is set for distribution by Focus Features. Directed by the American-born Cary Fukunaga, with a largely Hispanic ensemble of actors, ''Sin Nombre'' is a thriller about Central American migrants trying to cross into the United States.
 But the festival's biggest shift, those who programmed it say, appears to be from head to heart. Alienation is out. Engagement is in.
 ''Not caring is no longer an issue,'' said Mr. Cooper, who described this crop of festival filmmakers as a next wave who had clearly broken with the ''navel gazing'' that characterized past Sundance films. ''The Chumscrubber,'' for example, from the 2005 festival, was one of a run of indie movies about youth trapped in dysfunctional suburbia.
 To hear Mr. Gilmore tell it, things may get downright weepy. Of one coming film, Lee Daniels's ''Push,'' based on a novel about the trials of an abused girl in Harlem, he said, ''It's so dark, but I cried so hard at the end of it.''
 Some movies, Mr. Gilmore said, would challenge assumptions about the festival's supposedly knee-jerk devotion to liberal, progressive political messages. One such film, he said, was the director Ross Katz's ''Taking Chance,'' based on real events, about a military escort officer who accompanies the body of a dead marine back to his hometown in Wyoming. More about the feelings and values of the characters involved in the story, ''Taking Chance,'' Mr. Gilmore said, stands apart from the heavy run of antiwar pictures that have populated festivals for years.
 Inevitably many of the festival's features cluster around subjects and themes. Environmental calamity is a big one, especially on the documentary list. ''Crude,'' from Joe Berlinger, shows the oil industry chewing up the rain forest in Ecuador; ''The Cove,'' from Louie Psihoyos, tracks trouble in a sick ocean to a secret cove in Japan; and ''Dirt the Movie,'' from Bill Benenson and Gene Rosow, looks at man's destruction of dirt.
 (Films shown out of competition -- about half the features, and generally a more star-studded lot -- are expected to be announced separately on Thursday.)
 The festival celebrates its 25th year with a relatively low-key approach -- the related Sundance Institute had a silver anniversary two years ago -- built around the notion of storytelling. Filmmakers and others involved with the festival over the years are being invited to contribute online (at festival.sundance.org) to a collection of reminiscences, some of which are likely to be shared in connection with January's screenings.
 Mr. Cooper and Mr. Gilmore said festival officials were stepping carefully around demands that they cooperate with a boycott of businesses associated with supporters of California's Proposition 8, banning gay marriage.
 The festival, for instance, will make certain that no film is screened only in the Holiday Village theater in Park City, operated by Cinemark, a chain whose chief executive, Alan Stock, donated to Proposition 8's backers in the November election. The idea is to give anyone who has qualms about Cinemark the opportunity to see a movie somewhere else.
 But, given the dearth of theaters, programmers don't intend to abandon the Holiday Village. 
 ''We don't have an alternative,'' Mr. Gilmore said. ''If we had another theater we could walk down the street to, we might be thinking about that.''

HEADLINE: Holding On to the Tiny Home That Is Her Castle

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
Even by New York City standards, Sandra Walker's home is small. 
 It had no closets, so she turned the bedroom into one and made her living room into her bedroom. The shower is in the kitchen.
 But Ms. Walker, 57, who has lived in her Columbus Avenue apartment on the Upper West Side for nearly half of her life, says she has no desire to be anyplace else.
 ''This apartment to me is my little mansion,'' she said as she looked around her place. ''My little castle.'' 
 But the people in storybook castles are usually royalty: they don't have jobs on the other side of the moat and they don't have to pay rent. 
 For most of her adult life, Ms. Walker worked either as a secretary or an administrative assistant. For 12 years she worked at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, where she earned $33,000 a year. But she was abruptly laid off in January 2006 because of budget cuts. She was given $4,000 in severance pay, which she thought would be plenty to tide her over until she could find another job.
 Instead, Ms. Walker found that employers were seeking computer skills that she lacked. So she went back to school and learned programs like PowerPoint and Excel. Still, she could not find a job.
 Before long, the $4,000 was spent, her unemployment benefits of $404 a month had timed out and her savings had been exhausted. She had fallen a year behind on her rent, and owed $13,000 on a credit card.
 ''This time last year, I didn't know if I was going to make it,'' she said. ''I didn't have any money. I was behind on my rent. I didn't have a job.''
 In retrospect, Ms. Walker said, her trials had been a sign from God that she needed faith.
 ''These doors were just closing left and right,'' she said. ''Get into trouble, lose your job and see who your family and friends are. It seemed like every week I was being attacked. I was crying out to God, saying, 'What's going on?' But God was teaching me a valuable lesson. He was saying, 'I am your provider. I am your source.' ''
 Now Ms. Walker has begun to get some help. She has received the equivalent of two months' rent from the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies; one month's rent ($652.31) each from Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York and the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, a beneficiary agency of UJA-Federation of New York, all supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, and the Coalition for the Homeless. She also received $500 from Nazareth Housing.
 Ms. Walker thought the worst of her financial straits were over once she found a job earlier this year as a registration clerk at 1199, the Service Employees International Union, the giant health care workers' union in New York. She was able to repay nearly all of her rent arrears.
 But during a meeting at work a few weeks ago, she learned that planned cutbacks at the union might mean she could be out of work again by the end of the year. As it turned out, it was even sooner: She was laid off the week before Thanksgiving. 
 Still, Ms. Walker, who is looking for work again, says she feels better about her prospects than she has in a while, and credits her Christian faith for her calm.
 ''In order to have testimony,'' she said, ''you have to go through the test.''

HEADLINE: From Hoof to Dinner Table, A New Bid to Cut Emissions

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: STERKSEL, the Netherlands 

 BODY:
The cows and pigs dotting these flat green plains in the southern Netherlands create a bucolic landscape. But looked at through the lens of greenhouse gas accounting, they are living smokestacks, spewing methane emissions into the air. 
 That is why a group of farmers-turned-environmentalists here at a smelly but impeccably clean research farm have a new take on making a silk purse from a sow's ear: They cook manure from their 3,000 pigs to capture the methane trapped within it, and then use the gas to make electricity for the local power grid. 
 Rising in the fields of the environmentally conscious Netherlands, the Sterksel project is a rare example of fledgling efforts to mitigate the heavy emissions from livestock. But much more needs to be done, scientists say, as more and more people are eating more meat around the world. 
 What to do about farm emissions is one of the main issues being discussed this week and next, as the environment ministers from 187 nations gather in Poznan, Poland, for talks on a new treaty to combat global warming. In releasing its latest figure on emissions last month, United Nations climate officials cited agriculture and transportation as the two sectors that remained most ''problematic.'' 
 ''It's an area that's been largely overlooked,'' said Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, head of the Nobel Prize-winning United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He says people should eat less meat to control their carbon footprints. ''We haven't come to grips with agricultural emissions.'' 
 The trillions of farm animals around the world generate 18 percent of the emissions that are raising global temperatures, according to United Nations estimates, more even than from cars, buses and airplanes. 
 But unlike other industries, like cement making and power, which are facing enormous political and regulatory pressure to get greener, large-scale farming is just beginning to come under scrutiny as policy makers, farmers and scientists cast about for solutions. 
 High-tech fixes include those like the project here, called ''methane capture,'' as well as inventing feed that will make cows belch less methane, which traps heat with 25 times the efficiency of carbon dioxide. California is already working on a program to encourage systems in pig and dairy farms like the one in Sterksel. 
 Other proposals include everything from persuading consumers to eat less meat to slapping a ''sin tax'' on pork and beef. Next year, Sweden will start labeling food products so that shoppers can look at how much emission can be attributed to serving steak compared with, say, chicken or turkey. 
 ''Of course for the environment it's better to eat beans than beef, but if you want to eat beef for New Year's, you'll know which beef is best to buy,'' said Claes Johansson, chief of sustainability at the Swedish agricultural group Lantmannen. 
 But such fledgling proposals are part of a daunting game of catch-up. In large developing countries like China, India and Brazil, consumption of red meat has risen 33 percent in the last decade. It is expected to double globally between 2000 and 2050. While the global economic downturn may slow the globe's appetite for meat momentarily, it is not likely to reverse a profound trend. 
 Of the more than 2,000 projects supported by the United Nations' ''green'' financing system intended to curb emissions, only 98 are in agriculture. There is no standardized green labeling system for meat, as there is for electric appliances and even fish. 
 Indeed, scientists are still trying to define the practical, low-carbon version of a slab of bacon or a hamburger. Every step of producing meat creates emissions. 
 Flatus and manure from animals contain not only methane, but also nitrous oxide, an even more potent warming agent. And meat requires energy for refrigeration as it moves from farm to market to home. 
 Producing meat in this ever-more crowded world requires creating new pastures and planting more land for imported feeds, particularly soy, instead of relying on local grazing. That has contributed to the clearing of rain forests, particularly in South America, robbing the world of crucial ''carbon sinks,'' the vast tracts of trees and vegetation that absorb carbon dioxide. 
 ''I'm not sure that the system we have for livestock can be sustainable,'' said Dr. Pachauri of the United Nations. A sober scientist, he suggests that ''the most attractive'' near-term solution is for everyone simply to ''reduce meat consumption,'' a change he says would have more effect than switching to a hybrid car. 
 The Lancet medical journal and groups like the Food Ethics Council in Britain have supported his suggestion to eat less red meat to control global emissions, noting that Westerners eat more meat than is healthy anyway. 
 Producing a pound of beef creates 11 times as much greenhouse gas emission as a pound of chicken and 100 times more than a pound of carrots, according to Lantmannen, the Swedish group.
 But any suggestion to eat less meat may run into resistance in a world with more carnivores and a booming global livestock industry. Meat producers have taken issue with the United Nations' estimate of livestock-related emissions, saying the figure is inflated because it includes the deforestation in the Amazon, a phenomenon that the Brazilian producers say might have occurred anyway. 
 United Nations scientists defend their accounting. With so much demand for meat, ''you do slash rain forest,'' said Pierre Gerber, a senior official at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Soy cultivation has doubled in Brazil during the past decade, and more than half is used for animal feed. 
 Laurence Wrixon, executive director of the International Meat Secretariat, said that his members were working with the Food and Agriculture Organization to reduce emissions but that the main problem was fast-rising consumption in developing countries. ''So whether you like it or not, there's going to be rising demand for meat, and our job is to make it as sustainable as possible,'' he said. 
 Estimates of emissions from agriculture as a percentage of all emissions vary widely from country to country, but they are clearly over 50 percent in big agricultural and meat-producing countries like Brazil, Australia and New Zealand. 
 In the United States, agriculture accounted for just 7.4 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in 2006, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. 
 The percentage was lower because the United States produces extraordinarily high levels of emissions in other areas, like transportation and landfills, compared with other nations. The figure also did not include fuel burning and land-use changes. 
 Wealthy, environmentally conscious countries with large livestock sectors -- the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany and New Zealand -- have started experimenting with solutions. 
 In Denmark, by law, farmers now inject manure under the soil instead of laying it on top of the fields, a process that enhances its fertilizing effect, reduces odors and also prevents emissions from escaping. By contrast, in many parts of the developing world, manure is left in open pools and lathered on fields.
 Others suggest including agriculture emissions in carbon cap-and-trade systems, which currently focus on heavy industries like cement making and power generation. Farms that produce more than their pre-set limit of emissions would have to buy permits from greener colleagues to pollute.
 New Zealand recently announced that it would include agriculture in its new emissions trading scheme by 2013. To that end, the government is spending tens of millions of dollars financing research and projects like breeding cows that produce less gas and inventing feed that will make cows belch less methane, said Philip Gurnsey of the Environment Ministry. 
 At the electricity-from-manure project here in Sterksel, the refuse from thousands of pigs is combined with local waste materials (outdated carrot juice and crumbs from a cookie factory), and pumped into warmed tanks called digesters. There, resident bacteria release the natural gas within, which is burned to generate heat and electricity. 
 The farm uses 25 percent of the electricity, and the rest is sold to a local power provider. The leftover mineral slurry is an ideal fertilizer that reduces the use of chemical fertilizers, whose production releases a heavy dose of carbon dioxide. 
 For this farm the scheme has provided a substantial payback: By reducing its emissions, it has been able to sell carbon credits on European markets. It makes money by selling electricity. It gets free fertilizer. 
 And, in a small country where farmers are required to have manure trucked away, it saves $190,000 annually in disposal fees. John Horrevorts, experiment coordinator, whose family has long raised swine, said that dozens of such farms had been set up in the Netherlands, though cost still makes it impractical for small piggeries. Indeed, one question that troubles green farmers is whether consumers will pay more for their sustainable meat. 
 ''In the U.K., supermarkets are sometimes asking about green, but there's no global system yet,'' said Bent Claudi Lassen, chairman of the Danish Bacon and Meat Council, which supports green production. ''We're worried that other countries not producing in a green way, like Brazil, could undercut us on price.''

HEADLINE: For the Moral Paragon

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER and PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
 WAS a holiday season ever so economically and environmentally fraught? The ethics of financial responsibility and conservation suggest that one recycle and regift, while the national economy requires a huge infusion of cash. A freshly cut tree is essential for many people's Christmases, but the globe is heading toward meltdown. Even the act of wrapping a present has become a politically charged act. 
 The only thing that could make this year's shopping more perplexing is the high-minded do-gooder on your list. The last thing you want is to appear frivolous, ungreen or materialistic in your choice of gift for this righteous citizen. 
 It's possible, of course, to go overboard on asceticism, as Alexa Hampton did one year (not out of concern for the environment, she admits, but because she had failed ''to get it together''), giving her father a Christmas present draped in a towel. Since then Ms. Hampton, daughter of the late Mark Hampton, decorator to presidents and vice presidents, has evolved. The principal of her father's firm since his death in 1998, she has learned to strike a balance in a household known for its exquisite decorations, including a tree adorned by her father's hand-painted ornaments.
 ''As I have gotten older, I have realized that it's the ritual of presentation that counts for more than the gift,'' she said. Indeed, Ms. Hampton has learned to wrap. Nothing fancy, mind you: just white paper and twine tied with berries or bells. ''I think that's very sexy,'' she explained.
 But this year's ''moral hazards,'' Ms. Hampton said, call for more than elegant packaging, and she plans to give gifts meant to assuage anticonsumerist queasiness without sacrificing style. 
 A portion of the cost of peony prints (and other archival images) from Artaissance, for example, benefits the New York Botanical Garden. ''You often read about tradition with a twist,'' she said, ''but these really are tradition with a twist. It's as if Andy Warhol were having his way with the botanical garden.'' 
 A terra cotta plate from the Shop for a Better World collection at Macy's is part of a sustainable business initiative that invests in regional artisans and their communities -- in this case, one in Indonesia. It also reminds Ms. Hampton of a modern-day version of Aptware, for which she has a soft spot. 
 The purchase of a monogrammed Lucite tray from Dabney Lee at Home benefits the Humane Society of the United States, ''and a monogram is a great way to let someone know you've thought of them,'' Ms. Hampton said. Lucite, she added, is ''playful in any setting but particularly in a traditional interior.'' 
 At the Chelsea store of Alpha Workshops, a nonprofit that trains people living with H.I.V./AIDS in the decorative arts, Ms. Hampton discovered hand-cast plaster cat bookends and a paperweight called ''Two Shrews,'' based on an old children's book illustration. ''Speaking as a shrew,'' she said, ''why wouldn't I like two?'' 
 The Saks Green House collection yielded salad servers made from recycled aluminum -- doubly pleasing, Ms. Hampton suggested, to those averse to wastefulness. ''We all have boxes and platters of stuff, things you're given that don't have an immediate use,'' Ms. Hampton said. ''These servers can be pressed into service immediately.'' (And, she added, ''the little balls make me think of Christmas ornaments and jingle bells.'')
 Considering her list of well-intentioned gifts, Ms. Hampton paused. 
 ''We're all supposed to be shopping, right?'' she said finally. ''Perhaps the greatest gift of all would be to go to G.M. and buy a car. But in the absence of that, what about a nice pair of salad servers?''

HEADLINE: How Should India Respond to Terror?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''India's 9/11? Not Exactly,'' by Amitav Ghosh (Op-Ed, Dec. 3):
 I completely agree with Mr. Ghosh when he says the Indian response should not be one of ''precipitate action.'' 
 As an Indian citizen, I was witness to the tragedy that played out on Indian television for hours. It was surreal and horrific. Is it not then apt to say that the Indian citizenry has been pushed to the brink? If the mood of Indian citizens is to demand change in this situation, then it is completely justified. 
 The central and Maharashtra governments had a responsibility; they let us down. The level of anger in Indian people can be judged by the stiff responses that they command from their leaders. Then, the real danger that we face as Indian people is being blinded by antagonism and passionate rhetoric. 
 Militarily engaging with Pakistan is not a commendable option. We can neither afford to be complacent nor feel dispossessed by our democracy.
 Avantika Shrivastava New Delhi, Dec. 3, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Fresh Blood From an Old Wound'' (Op-Ed, Dec. 2):
 Pankaj Mishra states that the ''outrage in Mumbai is the latest and clearest sign that the price of India's uncompromising stance on Kashmir has become too high, imperiling its economy as well as its security.'' 
 Throughout history, numerous nations have engaged in protracted and futile talks in hopes of resolving epic-old conflicts, including over disputed territories. I am hard pressed to come up with many recent success stories.
 As an American of Indian descent who witnessed the attacks of 9/11 firsthand and the siege in Mumbai on TV, I cringe at the suggestion that these acts of terrorism against civilians should be regarded as evidence of a flawed political position rather than what they are -- cowardly attacks by people who have a warped sense of what honor is and who cannot and should not be negotiated with.
 Manisha Shah Long Island City, Queens, Dec. 2, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Pankaj Mishra hits the nail on the head. The war on terror will remain mired in ineffectiveness until India, Pakistan and Afghanistan stop working against one another and develop a joint strategy of cooperation toward a common objective. 
 Kashmir's long-simmering conflict seems to preclude such an approach. One hopes that the resolution of this issue with the consequent contribution to peace in South Asia and security of the United States would be among the top priorities of the Obama-Clinton team.
 Masood Haider Princeton Junction, N.J., Dec. 3, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Amitav Ghosh's assertion that Mumbai is not India's 9/11 is exactly wrong. Even worse, he, along with Pankaj Mishra, does great injustice to Indians by conflating a major terrorist attack on India and people of many nationalities and faiths with the Kashmir issue and other violent incidents in India. 
 The scale, intensity and nature of the Mumbai attacks, where 10 terrorists entered Mumbai from outside the country to create three days of well-planned terror and mayhem, has many parallels to the World Trade Center attack on 9/11. The event has also highlighted the failures in India's security and intelligence infrastructure just as 9/11 did in the United States.
 Instead of blaming India first, as is their wont, Mr. Ghosh and Mr. Mishra should join those of us who are calling on the international community to act decisively to ensure that terrorist training camps and networks in Pakistan are neutralized using an international United Nations-sanctioned force if necessary. 
 Enough is enough.
 Ram Kelkar Chicago, Dec. 3, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Amitav Ghosh and Pankaj Mishra seem to believe that India's only response to the Mumbai massacres should be to look inward and exhibit greater patience. After all, as Mr. Ghosh points out, India has suffered many terrorist attacks in the past and seems to have moved on.
 Well, apparently not this time. The angry reaction of the people of India in the aftermath of these horrific attacks suggests that they are tired of being treated as sponges who can absorb punishment. They are demanding answers and action from their government, and it's about time.
 Neil Das Gupta Monmouth Junction, N.J., Dec. 3, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The tragedy in Mumbai brought back memories of Jews in Bombay in 1944. I was stationed in India for two years during World War II as a radio operator with the United States Army Airways Communications Center. 
 In April 1944, when we arrived in Bombay, the Jewish community there invited members of the military of all countries who were Jewish to a Passover dinner at their community center. It was an extraordinary moment for me, a unique cultural experience, unexpectedly encountering Jews from other countries who did not quite look like my family.
 We were at war, and religious holidays were really not on my mind. But there I was in a strange country, seated at a table with several enlisted men from England, enjoying a convivial dinner given by the most gracious people. 
 Jews in Bombay? New York, yes, but India? And then in September 1945 the Jews of New Delhi invited the military to participate in Rosh Hashana services. Undoubtedly, the Jews I had met in India in those years were really a part of their country.

HEADLINE: Recession Trickles to India

BYLINE: By JEREMY KAHN

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India 

 BODY:
After years of being blamed for job losses in America and elsewhere, India's high-tech companies and outsourcing firms are going through a downturn of their own. The global slowdown is forcing them to reduce hiring, freeze salaries, postpone new investments and lay off thousands of software programmers and call center operators. 
 While some industry insiders insist the global crisis will actually benefit companies here, as Western businesses seek to cut costs by moving jobs overseas, right now the sector is suddenly gripped by an unfamiliar sense of uncertainty.
 ''It's certainly not irrational exuberance,'' said Nandan Nilekani, co-chairman of Infosys, one of India's best-known technology outsourcing firms. ''There is a lot of introspection about what does this mean and when does it end.'' 
 The downturn is exposing a deeper concern: India has become the world's front office, handling customer service calls, and its back office, helping to process payments and run accounting and other computer systems. But it has not yet become the head office -- making major new products, pioneering marketing techniques or helping to shape corporate strategy.
 Rather than drowning American technology firms or work forces with a vast supply of cheap engineering talent, as some had feared, India -- and Bangalore, its Silicon Valley -- have continued to largely serve as the information economy's version of manual labor.
 ''Historically, when it comes to innovation, Indian companies are relatively weak compared to the I.B.M.'s and Accentures of the world,'' said Partha Iyengar, the head of research in India for the Gartner Group, which analyzes trends in the tech sector. ''It has been their chronic Achilles' heel.''
 Last week's coordinated terrorist attacks killed nearly 200 people and temporarily brought Mumbai, India's commercial capital, to a halt. But long before that shock, the country had been suffering the effects of the global slump, losing capital as Western investors fled to the security of American Treasuries, undermining Indian banks and company balance sheets.
 Infosys recently scaled back its projections for the year, telling investors that it now expects revenue to expand 13 to 15 percent, instead of the 19 to 21 percent it had forecast and far below the 30 percent annual expansion the company had been used to.
 Like many of India's outsourcing companies, Infosys is heavily dependent on the financial sector, deriving a third of its revenue from banks like Citigroup and Bank of America and other financial clients. Its fate is also closely tied to the American economy: two-thirds of its business comes from the United States. Neither factor bodes well for the company's prospects.
 Technology Partners International, a consulting firm that publishes an index of global outsourcing deals, says its index is at a 10-year low. ''People think that outsourcing is a recession-proof industry. It is not,'' said Siddharth Pai, a partner at the firm.
 That realization has changed the boomtown atmosphere of this city. Young workers still flock to a rooftop terrace on Residency Road every Wednesday night to grind to house and hip-hop music. But lately, the crowds at NYKS, an upscale nightclub, are a little thinner. They drink a little bit less. They talk a little less loudly. ''Now they are thinking twice before spending money,'' said Supreeth Chandrasekhar, a 25-year-old disc jockey at NYKS. 
 Mr. Chandrasekhar also said that he used to perform at corporate events but that this business had largely disappeared. 
 In a country where most marriages are arranged by parents, the downturn has even taken a toll on the matrimonial prospects of those in technology outsourcing. ''Because there is no job guarantees for I.T. people, for the last six months brides' families have not been accepting grooms from this background,'' said Jagadeesh Angadi, a matchmaker in Bangalore.
 The Indian National Association of Software and Service Companies estimates that the country's technology sector will create 50,000 fewer jobs in 2008 than last year, although it predicts the sector will still have added 200,000 workers by year's end. India's technology outsourcing companies have laid off about 10,000 employees since September, according to the Union for Information Technology Enabled Services, a labor group that represents technology workers.
 Among the major players that have announced cutbacks in hiring is Satyam Computer Services, which slashed its recruitment plans to fewer than 10,000 from 15,000. Infosys, by contrast, has almost $2 billion in cash on its balance sheet, a significant amount that can help it weather the downturn. It said it intended to follow through on plans to hire 25,000 workers this year. 
 ''We made offers to people, and we need to stand by them,'' Mr. Nilekani of Infosys said.
 But some companies that have hired recruits are postponing their start dates. The deferrals allow companies, which once hired in anticipation of future business, to better manage overhead by adding staff only when they have confirmed projects. 
 A few so-called captive outsourcing operations -- those that serve only their parent company in Europe or the United States -- have also cut back. American Express laid off some 200 of its 6,000 workers in India, and Goldman Sachs announced last month that it would dismiss about 10 percent of its Indian work force. 
 Still, for the moment, the industry has escaped large-scale job losses. Indian labor laws make it difficult for companies to drop workers, and mass firings can draw a political outcry. But outsourcing companies have begun pruning workers, citing poor job performance, a way to quietly reduce labor costs without attracting much public scrutiny.
 The large outsourcing company Wipro dismissed 2.5 percent of its work force in the second quarter. Outsourcing companies are also shelving expansion plans. Wipro, for instance, announced it was postponing the opening of a major new software development center in Atlanta.
 But India's business leaders see opportunity in the downturn. ''Once things settle down, people will start looking at their business operations and how to make them more efficient, and that is where we play,'' Mr. Nilekani said.
 Even consolidation on Wall Street, which may eliminate some Indian companies' clients, could help Indian workers, outsourcing executives say. Mergers require technical skills to integrate disparate systems, and there is a potential for profitable outsourcing work in areas like regulatory compliance. Banks are likely to be under stricter government scrutiny given the sense that lax oversight contributed to the financial crisis. 
 Raman Roy, chairman of Quatrro BPO Solutions, an outsourcing firm based in New Delhi, says he has 300 employees reviewing legal documents as part of bank mergers. Copal Partners, a company that uses employees in India to help investment banks do the sort of deal-based research normally performed by the bank's junior analysts, has continued to expand even during the downturn.
 Critics say that will not change the local industry's basic disadvantage: a creativity gap with Western competitors. Indian technology companies are too focused on increasing the efficiency of their systems, not improving their clients' own industry-specific processes, according to Navi Radjou, an analyst with Forrester Research. ''They are having trouble tailoring a technical application to a particular business need,'' he said.
 But India's biggest tech outsourcing companies want to do as much as their European and American rivals, including expanding in Europe and the United States. And the downturn may allow them to acquire talent -- and even whole businesses -- on the cheap. In August, for example, Infosys acquired the British consulting firm Axon for $753 million. Wipro is said to be shopping for a similar acquisition. 
 The changes may come too late for workers like Vikram Hathwar. 
 In July, Mr. Hathwar, a 22-year-old engineer, graduated from a technical college with a job offer from a software developer. But instead of starting his job -- paying nearly $6,000 a year, a good starting salary in this country -- Mr. Hathwar has been waiting for a letter from the company telling him when to report for work.
 ''I called them and they said they would be calling two or three months later, but still they have not informed me anything about when I should start,'' Mr. Hathwar said. 
 In the meantime, he has begun looking for a temporary job. But he said most tech businesses are no longer hiring recent graduates. The few that are have begun asking applicants to intern for several months without pay and with no guarantee of a permanent position. ''The recession has made for all these pressures on us,'' Mr. Hathwar said. ''It is very confusing to know what to do.''

HEADLINE: Capital One Is Expected to Buy a Rival Bank

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
In the latest sign of consolidation among midsize American banks, Capital One Financial plans to buy Chevy Chase Bank for about $520 million. The deal will allow it to rely more on customer deposits for financing. 
 The deal, which is expected to be announced Thursday morning, would immediately add to Capital One's operating earnings, though the purchase would require Capital One to write off $1.75 billion in anticipated losses from Chevy Chase's big portfolio of toxic mortgage loans. Capital One will pay $445 million in cash and $75 million in stock based on Tuesday's closing price of $29.29 a share, according to several people briefed on the deal.
 Capital One will also be eligible to grab a bigger portion of the $350 million bailout fund the Treasury Department has set aside for financial institutions. In late October, it received $3.55 billion from the government. It now could qualify for Chevy Chase's allotment of up to $450 million in additional money. 
 Analysts say that Capital One will also be able to take advantage of the lucrative tax loophole from a recent change in the tax code engineered by the Treasury to encourage bank deals. While the deal spawns a new midsize bank, it also shows how hard it will be to generate new national players to rival the likes of JPMorgan, Bank of America and Wells Fargo. 
 It also underscores the difficulties for Citigroup, still struggling to improve its business after the government came to its aid last week, to assemble its own domestic retail branch network. Citigroup had previously sought to bid for Chevy Chase Bank in an effort to gain deposits after its bid for the Wachovia Corporation was thwarted in October. But even if Citigroup had acquired Chevy Chase, it would still be far behind other national players.
 Capital One will gain access to about $11.6 billion in deposits at a time when it difficult to raise money in the capital markets. It will have 244 branches in the Washington metropolitan area. It will now have the fifth largest share of retail deposits in the Washington area, behind Bank of America, Wells Fargo, BB&T and SunTrust Bank. 
 After being frozen out of the credit markets following the last economic downturn in 2001, Capital One embarked on a strategy to transform itself into a consumer bank. 
 It snapped up Hibernia Bancorp in Louisiana shortly in 2005 and then bought North Fork Bank in New York in early 2007 so that it no longer had to rely on fickle investors for money. However, it never had a retail presence in the Washington area, where the company was based. 
 Today, other finance companies, including American Express and CIT Group, have found the current environment so challenging that they recently applied to for bank licenses to stabilize their financing base. 
 For Chevy Chase, the deal gives its longtime chairman and chief executive, B. Francis Saul II, an exit strategy in a turbulent market. As of March, Mr. Saul was more than 75 years old and owned a majority of the privately held bank. 
 Capital One's bigger balance sheet will also be better positioned to ride out the credit storm. Almost one-fourth of its assets, or over $4 billion, were highly toxic pay-option mortgages that were issued to borrowers in California and Florida, far from the bank's home turf.

HEADLINE: This Season's Must-Have: The Humble Coupon

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE faltering economy could mean renewed interest in coupons as shoppers refocus on the cost of the products they buy -- that is, if they do actually buy anything these days.
 Coupons that offer cents off -- or percents off -- the price of things like groceries, clothing and restaurant meals are particularly popular when consumers need to stretch their dollars. So word that a recession began last December could bring an increase in the number of coupons offered by marketers, as well as redemption rates by consumers.
 ''Thrift is the new normal,'' said Lance Saunders, executive vice president and head of account planning at Campbell Mithun in Minneapolis, an agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies. 
 ''There's no stigma to getting anything on discount,'' Mr. Saunders said. ''Instead, there's a sense of pride.''
 Already, there are some signs of a nascent coupon chic:
 The Lucky Brand of apparel sold by Liz Claiborne is offering coupons on a humorous holiday Web site (luckybuckoff.com). The more skillfully computer users play a game, the larger the discount they earn on coupons redeemable at stores or on the regular Lucky Web site (luckybrandjeans.com). The discount, 20 percent off for every player, can be raised to 25 or 30 percent.
 ''It's a tough time for all of us,'' said Kristin Patrick, vice president for marketing at Lucky Brand in Los Angeles. ''This is about entertaining your customers and getting them engaged with the brand.'' The campaign was created by Lime Public Relations and Promotion in New York, part of the Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners unit of MDC Partners.
 Procter & Gamble, the nation's largest advertiser, is producing a retail version of BrandSaver, the coupon booklets that the company inserts in Sunday newspapers 14 times a year. A temporary store named BrandSaver Live opened on Friday on West 57th Street at the Avenue of the Americas in Manhattan.
 At the store, scheduled to remain open through Dec. 11, visitors can receive advance copies of the BrandSaver coupons to be distributed with Dec. 14 newspapers, along with samples and demonstrations of products like Clairol, Downy, Olay and Tide.
 Coupons are ''an effective trial and awareness vehicle,'' said Jim Leish, director for North American commercial operations at P.& G. in Cincinnati. Translated from marketer-ese, that means coupons encourage consumers to try products and raise the profiles of brand names, especially as the lower prices of store-label products at supermarkets and drugstores are luring shoppers. 
 All You magazine, published by the Time Inc. division of Time Warner and sold by Wal-Mart Stores, is offering subscribers to a new weekly e-mail newsletter, All You Deals and Meals, a sneak peek at the coupons to appear in the coming issue of the magazine.
 ''Our reader is a value-driven consumer,'' said Diane Oshin, publisher of All You, which regularly runs so many coupons in each issue that it carries a coupon index, typically next to the masthead.
 ''We are not an F.S.I.,'' Ms. Oshin said, using the industry term for a newspaper coupon booklet, free-standing insert. But many advertisers in All You have found that the coupons give them a great return on their investment, she said.
 Valpak Direct Marketing Systems, which distributes coupons under the Valpak brand, has been advertising on national programs like ''ABC World News.''
 New technologies are also helping to renew interest in coupons, especially for younger consumers. There are scores of Web sites where coupons can be obtained by clicking rather than clipping; among them are coupons.com, couponcabin.com, couponcode.com, couponmom.com, 8coupons.com, fatwallet.com and shortcuts.com. Many also deliver coupons by e-mail messages.
 And coupons are increasingly available on cellphones and other mobile devices from companies like Cellfire and Outalot. Among the marketers offering mobile coupons are Arby's, Caribou Coffee and GameStop.
 An advantage of coupons delivered through new technologies is that they can be customized and personalized, which could help make them more effective and efficient for the sponsors.
 ''Consumers are craving value, and marketers are no different,'' said Todd Morris, senior vice president at Catalina Marketing in St. Petersburg, Fla., which provides coupons that can be aimed at specific customers at the checkouts of more than 200 store chains, for products sold by more than 300 companies.
 Mr. Morris describes such coupons as ''discretionary discounting'' rather than ''one size fits all.'' For instance, shoppers who buy a tube of a certain brand of toothpaste can receive a coupon to save money on their next purchase -- if they buy three tubes.
 ''Only when they change behavior, and buy more, more often, do they get a discount,'' he said. 
 Complete data for coupon use in 2008 will not be available until next year. In 2007, according to the Coupon Council of the Promotion Marketing Association, 89 percent of the population said they used coupons, compared with 86 percent in 2006.
 ''I've looked at some data that show 94 percent say they're using coupons in 2008,'' said Charles Brown, co-chairman of the council and vice president for marketing services at NCH Marketing Services in Deerfield, Ill., a unit of Valassis Communications.
 Last year was the first time since 1992 that redemption rates for coupons did not decline from the previous year. Mr. Brown attributed that to the problems that consumers began to have with subprime mortgages, which ''made them start being more conscious about saving.''
 ''Back in the recessions of the 1970s and the 1980s,'' he said, marketers saw ''consumers redeem more coupons.''
 In recent years, less than 1 percent of all coupons issued by marketers have been redeemed by consumers. One reason for that was a decision to shorten the expiration dates of coupons, Mr. Brown said, to an average of nine weeks, from nine months in the '80s.
 Another reason he cited was the proliferation of loyalty programs sponsored by retailers, which offer shoppers a chance to save money by using plastic cards rather than paper coupons.

HEADLINE: Ahead of Auto Bailout Hearings, Union Ready to Make Concessions

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY; David Stout and Bill Vlasic contributed reporting from Washington and Peter Baker from Chicago.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
A day before the three Detroit automakers return to Washington to again ask for a federal bailout, the United Automobile Workers union took its turn in promising cuts and concessions as part of a concerted effort to win the support of lawmakers. 
 The U.A.W. president, Ron Gettelfinger, said the union would suspend its jobs bank, which requires carmakers to keep paying laid-off employees, and would consider changes to its labor contracts. The union has also agreed, Mr. Gettelfinger said, to delay the payments that the automakers must make to a new retiree health care fund called a Voluntary Employee Beneficiary Association, or VEBA.
 The announcements came as the Detroit chief executives prepared to make a second plea for federal assistance at a House hearing on Thursday. The Senate holds a hearing on Friday. On Tuesday, the car companies submitted plans detailing why they needed government-backed loans and how they would use the money. 
 Together, the three Detroit companies are asking for $34 billion in aid, a significant increase from the $25 billion request the automakers made to Congress two weeks ago. The increase is based, Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally said, on the fact that Democratic leaders told the companies to base their revised loan requests on economic conditions. 
 Those conditions are getting steadily worse. On Tuesday, the industry reported that overall sales sank nearly 37 percent in November from the same period a year earlier.
 ''Part of the reason the money went up is that we gave them a range of what might happen with the economy and also with the industry,'' Mr. Mulally said. ''It shows that we're not focused on just one base line plan, but also what if it did get worse.''
 G.M. said it needed $4 billion this month merely to survive into 2009 and another $14 billion after that. The company plan calls for more plant closures and job cuts, along with the sale or elimination of four brands. Chrysler, which is requesting $7 billion, also said it could collapse soon without aid. Ford asked for a $9 billion line of credit but said it did not expect to access that money unless the economy worsens or a rivals fails.
 At a news conference, Mr. Gettelfinger said that the U.A.W. would be open to modifying the four-year contracts that it signed in 2007 but not to completely restarting negotiations. Changes could include cuts to wages, health care or other benefits, though he did not give details, and would require approval from union members, but the jobs bank suspension does not.
 About 3,600 workers currently receive benefits under the jobs bank program, which the automakers created in the 1980s to win union approval for productivity improvements. The automakers have played down the need to eliminate it, but industry critics often cite it as a symbol of inefficiency for Detroit.
 ''The jobs bank has become a sound bite that people use to beat us up,'' Mr. Gettelfinger said, who will join the auto executives at Congressional hearings starting Thursday. ''It's become a lightning rod that takes away the focus from what the real issue is, and the real issue is the backbone of America.'' 
 Mr. Mulally warned in an interview that a failure of G.M. or Chrysler could also drag down Ford and countless dealers and suppliers. But he said that he was under no illusion that Ford could survive a bankruptcy filing by either of its cross-town Detroit rivals. 
 ''If one of the major automobile companies should seek bankruptcy protection,'' he said, ''it could easily drag the entire industry into bankruptcy, which we think would be terrible for the U.S. economy as well as for the industry.''
 Mr. Mulally said Ford needed a line of credit in case the automotive market -- already the worst in 15 years -- continues to deteriorate.
 ''If despite everything that we're doing as a country to arrest this recession, that things still get worse, we at Ford might need a bridge loan,'' he said.
 Congressional leaders are reviewing the plans ahead of hearings on Thursday and Friday. 
 ''I think it is plain that Chrysler and General Motors cannot survive without government help,'' Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview on Fox. ''The need now is to take a detailed look at their plan to see if they have a realistic opportunity to survive.''
 Democratic leaders, who have been supportive of a bailout from the start, signaled their support of the new plans after they were filed, though many other lawmakers were waiting until the hearings before making a decision.
 A big question before Congress is where the money will come from to finance the loans.
 The Bush administration has declined to provide financing from the $700-billion financial rescue plan set up to help banks and other Wall Street institutions. The administration has suggested that aid for the automakers come from a $25 billion loan program for fuel-efficient vehicles already approved by Congress.
 However, Democratic lawmakers have balked at using that loan program for anything other than to encourage the development of cleaner cars and trucks.
 Mr. Mulally said that the automakers were not taking sides on where the money originates, only that it is approved before G.M. or Chrysler run out of operating cash.
 President-elect Barack Obama praised the three companies for producing ''a more serious set of plans'' to save the industry, but withheld judgment about how he thinks the federal government should help at this point.
 At a news conference announcing his commerce secretary, Mr. Obama said he had not seen the plans but pronounced himself pleased that the manufacturers were being more responsive to the concerns that he and lawmakers have expressed. 
 ''When the Big Three automakers came before them a couple of weeks ago,'' he said, referring to Congressional testimony by auto executives, ''they were not offering a clear plan for viability over the long term. And I think Congress was right to say that the taxpayers expect and deserve better than that before they are stepping up to the plate for any kind of bailout.''
 Now, he said, the latest plans indicate a seriousness by the auto executives. 
 ''But we should also make sure,'' he said, ''that any government assistance that's provided is designed for a -- is based on realistic assessments of what the auto market is going to be and a realistic plan for how we're going to make these companies viable over the long term.''
 Mr. Obama said he still wanted to listen to more discussion before deciding what he thinks the government should do next. ''It's premature to get into that issue,'' he said.
 At the U.A.W. meeting in Detroit, union officials described their members as extremely anxious about the prospect of more concessions but at the same time afraid of what would happen if the union did not aid the automakers.
 ''We've helped them before, but it seems like they always come back to us,'' said Shane Colvard, chairman of Local 2164 in Bowling Green, Ky., where G.M. builds the Chevrolet Corvette sports car.
 But a G.M. retiree, Frank Hammer, said looking to the union for givebacks does not resolve the automakers' problems and compounds the bad economy.
 ''More concessions mean more foreclosures,'' said Mr. Hammer, 65, who worked at G.M.'s transmission plant in Warren, Mich. ''Concessions are not a solution.''
 ''We're all getting smeared with this brush that we're somehow greedy,'' Mr. Hammer said. But if pay and benefits are cut, he told a group of reporters gathered outside the meeting, ''what autoworker is going to be able to buy their product?''

HEADLINE: Small Stores Find Ways To Drum Up Traffic

BYLINE: By KRISTINA SHEVORY

 BODY:
The owner of a futon store outside San Francisco started running comedy shows. A comic book shop in Florida held art shows. And a lingerie shop in New Mexico is planning a men's night later this month. 
 Small businesses are always searching for ways to differentiate themselves. But with fewer people out buying, some of the businesses are doing whatever they think will draw in customers. 
 ''This is a buyer's strike,'' said Eric G. Flamholtz, a professor emeritus of management at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''People are holding back and not spending any money. So you have to give them a reason to come.''
 Holding special events also can be far less expensive than regular advertising. And in a slowing economy, advertising and marketing budgets typically get trimmed. A recent National Small Business Association survey of its members found that 49 percent planned to start new advertising or marketing this year, down from 54 percent in 2007. 
 ''They're trying to market with little or no extra money,'' said Molly Brogan, the association's vice president of public affairs. ''People are doing more on the Internet, any free thing they can.''
 Deborah Reese, who owns a lingerie shop in Albuquerque, said she opted not to increase her advertising budget this year for the first time since she opened the shop, Seventh Goddess, four years ago. Instead, she said, she developed a new Facebook page and is encouraging employee blogs. She is also planning an array of events, like a recent ''Sex and the City'' pajama party in which customers sat on pillows for manicures and facials. Men's night is coming up later this month, where employees model the store's offerings and offer ''man food.'' And there will be an erotic poetry reading on Valentine's Day.
 ''Events are cheap publicity,'' Ms. Reese said. ''People who ordinarily wouldn't come, come. You just have to spring for the munchies and drinks.''
 The parties are also good for sales. Ms. Reese sold dozens of pajamas at her ''Sex and the City'' event and hundreds of pairs of underwear and bras at a men's night last December. She said she always offered discounts at the special events and a portion of her sales went to local charities. 
 Nor are the special events just for young businesses. Even well-established businesses, like Mary's Futons in San Rafael, Calif., have been feeling the pinch. Fewer people are buying new futons, and more futons are being brought in for repairs. Mary Hughes, the owner, said she thought a comedy show would be the perfect thing to do because ''everyone loves comedy and I wanted to meet women.'' A theatrical producer was less than convinced.
 '' 'Lady, are you crazy?' '' Lisa Geduldig, the producer of Kung Pao Kosher Comedy in San Francisco remembers telling Ms. Hughes. '' 'I don't do little futon stores; I do professional venues.' ''
 But after Ms. Hughes cornered her and begged her to do one show, she finally agreed. The first, ''An Evening of Lie-Down Comedy,'' was held in March and did so well, they added a second. When that one sold out, they added another. That, too, sold out. Proceeds from the tickets go back to the comedians and Ms. Geduldig. If more than 100 people attend, Ms. Hughes gets a small percentage of the ticket sales.
 ''I get the publicity and that's worth more than the money,'' Ms. Hughes said, though in a later interview she said she was taking over management of the shows.
 One recent Sunday night, a hundred people milled around the futon store, nibbling on cake and catching up on gossip. A window display had been turned into a stage, 30 futons were turned to face it and salespeople were doing sound checks. Raffle tickets for a water fountain and beanbag chair were being sold at the door and a line of people snaked away from a sales counter doing service as a concession stand.
 Ms. Geduldig threaded through the crowd to the stage, clambered on top and welcomed everyone to the show. ''This is a futon shop,'' she said. ''Feel free to fall asleep.''
 Everyone laughed. The show had begun.
 But for every successful event, there are others that do not work out. Ms. Hughes thought she could draw 100 people to her store for a holiday sing-a-long last December. Only a few people came. At Seventh Goddess, Ms. Reese assumed a poetry writing workshop on Valentine's Day would fill her store. Two people showed up.
 Mr. Flamholtz, who is also a business consultant, said store owners should be cautious about getting into the events business. ''The problem is that business owners want to diversify, but they'll diversify into something they don't know anything about,'' he said. ''They have to add products and services that make sense around their core.''
 Outside events can quickly become a second business, and are rarely as simple as they appear, said Martin Lehman, a counselor and marketing director for Counselors to America's Small Business, or Score, in New York. If a business owner wants artists to perform or exhibit their work, the business has to provide an incentive and make sure the event does not erode its brand, Mr. Lehman said. Ms. Reese noted that there were snacks to buy, bloggers to contact, community calendars to update and fliers to hand out. 
 Kimberly Smith-Johnson, who owned a comic book store, turned to her customers and local artists for help in putting on monthly art shows. As a former drama teacher, she turned them into her stagehands. They handed out fliers and blogged about her store.
 ''Events have been the best marketing tool, but they have to be genuine,'' said Ms. Smith-Johnson, whose business was Comics & Classics in Jacksonville Beach, Fla. ''It has to be about the artist and the event, not about bottom-line sales. People will pick up on the tone if it's not.''
 The events could not save her business, and Ms. Smith-Johnson and her husband, Percy, closed the store a few weeks ago. Even though many of their comic books were inexpensive, the Johnsons could not overcome one basic problem: they opened a new store right before the economic downturn.
 ''We got loved to death, but people just weren't purchasing enough to keep us going,'' said Ms. Smith-Johnson, who starts a new job as an eighth-grade teacher on Monday. ''We ran out of capital. Between the banks, credit cards and people not spending, we got squeezed in the middle.''
 Ms. Hughes, on the other hand, seems to have hit the right note with the comedy shows. At the September show, futons were crammed with four people each, many of them laughing. One woman yelled out, ''This is the hardest I've laughed in a long time.''
 Some said they could not believe where they were. ''This is a store I'd never come into and here I am,'' said Grace Flannery, from Novato, Calif. ''I'm looking around at these futons and they're a lot nicer than I thought.'' 
 Other customers seemed to agree. After some of the shows, audience members have returned to buy the exact futon they sat on.

HEADLINE: Secrets Only Your Witch Would Know

BYLINE: By CINTRA WILSON

 BODY:
HANDFULS of articles have been written since the economic downturn on how, during such times of anxiety, business booms for psychics, astrologists and card readers.
 Enchantments, the witchcraft store in the East Village, recently moved down the street from where it had been a landmark since 1982. Last year, my friend Nancy bought me one of its customized Solar Blast candles for my birthday. After lighting it, a flurry of life-altering changes suddenly occurred -- which was, at least, an amusing coincidence. I developed a more absorbing curiosity when Nancy gave me a second Solar Blast this year, and this one, too, seemed to be a cosmic throw-switch, releasing yet another mother lode of life-changing events. 
 ''Years ago, I had been dumped by my boyfriend and was out of my mind,'' Nancy told me as we waited at a cafe for Enchantments to open (a bit later than the posted store hours). ''This chick walked up to me at a party and told me she was 'drawn' to my 'grief mask.' '' 
 I chortled. 
 ''I was in that place where you'll insinuate yourself on anyone, so I told her my story,'' Nancy continued. ''She told me that I had to go to Enchantments. 
 ''I said, 'Wait ... aren't they, like, Wiccan?' And she said, 'Do you want your boyfriend back, or what?' 
 ''I went. First I got a tarot reading from this absolutely stunning witch, with big blue eyes, tons of black hair, a thick Bronx accent and a huge pentagram necklace. I was weeping, and she was so comforting! So maternal! She said, 'I am going to give you something very hard core.' She comes back with this fire engine red candle in the shape of a penis. She carved my name and the guy's name and our birth signs into it, then anointed it with oils.'' 
 And? 
 ''We ended up getting back together. But briefly. I realized the relationship was hollow and ridiculous. This witch gave me an object to project power on, but what the experience really gave me was the ability to see how much power I had on my own. I didn't need the guy. I got an idea of how to confront my own pain and darkness, and transform it into something positive.'' 
 Another friend of ours, an actress in her 50s, bought a candle ''dressed'' to assuage her anxiety about a big acting gig, which she landed. (She soon became the muse of a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, earned several film roles and was finally able to quit her day job. Coincidence?) 
 Two witches were on duty when we visited the shop: A young man who could be the fraternal twin of Wednesday Addams, who preferred to be known only as Ricky (occultists, it seems, are often cautious about giving their full names); and Kathy, a fetching, gum-chewing platinum blonde in a spiked belt, black jeans and a T-shirt sprayed down the front with escaped glitter. 
 A financial crash, Kathy agreed, is a good time to be in the occult business: ''We're always asked to do love stuff, but lately, it has been way more about jobs -- people looking for work and protection of their monies.''
 Nancy and I were shopping for luck for our literary projects. 
 ''If you're a writer, Mercury is your patron god,'' Ricky said. ''He's all about speed, speech and commerce. New York is his city. There's a big statue of Mercury at Grand Central station.'' 
 Our candles were selected by color, then spoonfuls of powdered incense were burned in the glass candleholders while Kathy and Ricky took out their daggers and carved ''magickal seals'' into our candles from a guidebook of drawings kept in plastic sleeves in a three-ring binder. Once the candles were carved, they put on latex gloves and rubbed custom oils and glitter into our candles. 
 ''We are so O.C.D. about oils,'' Kathy joked. ''We get them from, like, 15 different companies'' because, she explained, one could have an awesome almond but a peppermint of inferior quality.
 I had to ask: ''Where do you guys stand on Satan?'' 
 Eyes rolled. The Enchantments store policy is explicit on the Web site: ''We DO NOT carry any items dealing with black magick.''
 ''In nature you see both the light and the dark,'' Kathy explained. ''In other cultures, they embrace it all. We discourage people from doing certain kinds of spells, like, breaking up other people's relationships. 
 Manipulative magic always backfires,'' she continued. ''Everything you do comes back to you threefold.''
 ''You don't want to mess with the order of things,'' Ricky said. ''Believe me, I know.'' 
 Has increased knowledge of the Craft affected their daily lives? 
 ''It's great at parties,'' Ricky claimed. ''Whenever I'm drunk in a bar, I walk up to people and say, 'I bet you're a Taurus ... I can just tell.' Tauruses always have really nice bags.'' 
 ''I feel so held and loved!'' said Nancy, who was being crawled all over and kissed by the store's resident black cat, Medea. 
 Any success stories, lately? 
 ''A few weeks ago, a bunch of women I made fertility candles for a couple years ago all came in to show me their kids,'' Kathy said. 
 ''We each have our talent,'' Ricky said, explaining in colorful language that his specialty was helping those in need of sex. Finishing Nancy's candle, he dropped a red Boy's Night Out candle into its glass holder with a musky whooff of incense, for a client who buys them every Friday. 
 A black-clad man with a unicursal hexagram around his neck came in to show Ricky an out-of-print book on Sex Magick. ''Hey, I told your thelemite joke the other day!'' Ricky said. 
 ''What's the thelemite joke?'' I asked. 
 ''How many thelemites does it take to screw in a light bulb? None! Because Aleister Crowley never left instructions.'' (A thelemite, I learned, is a practitioner of ''thelemic magic.'') 
 Our candles, wrapped in paper, were each $20 -- a small price to pay, we felt, for the thrill of consorting with unknown forces, and the blessings of Mercury, god of New York. To bastardize Frank Sinatra: Hey! Wicca or Jack Daniel's ... whatever gets you through the winter.

HEADLINE: My Other Family Is the Office

BYLINE: By SARAH KERSHAW

 BODY:
THE office joker. The mother hen. The king. The rebel. The gossip. The peacekeeper. The dude. 
 Anyone who has ever been part of a workplace culture can probably recognize at least one of those characters in the cubicle next door. 
 But workplace roles and the dynamics among colleagues can go much deeper than those somewhat superficial stereotypes, especially in a nation where many people spend as much time with colleagues as they do with their families, where the office so often mirrors the family. 
 A boss is not just a boss, in the view of some psychologists who study workplace roles; he can be a stand-in for a disapproving and distant father. An unpredictable, easily angered manager can be a thinly veiled rejecting mother. Colleagues competing for the boss's attention -- or merit raises and bonuses -- are siblings in rivalry.
 The employees of a company acquired by another in a hostile merger? They can experience seething resentment toward what they feel is an unwelcome stepparent, according to psychologists working with companies to manage emotional fallout during a merger. 
 There is, too, the workplace spouse, a co-worker of the opposite sex who shares a kind of closeness achieved only through the intense experience of long weeks at the same office. 
 Given all the stress and uncertainty driven by the economic crisis, some companies, with the help of business and organizational psychologists, are plumbing the depths of these feelings and roles, trying to gauge their effects at a time when emotions are running high. A growing number of business psychologists and executive coaches are also looking at the influence of birth order and other family roles and niches on office behavior.
 ''Work is nothing more than an entirely complex set of relationships,'' said Michael W. Norris, a clinical psychologist in Los Angeles, who runs monthly leadership coaching groups and individual sessions with senior executives. ''You have partners that are your equals, subordinates, superiors,'' Mr. Norris said. ''It's parents and siblings. All of these dynamics that are exactly the same in the workplace, just the titles are different.''
 For example, said Laurence J. Stybel, a psychologist in the Boston area who specializes in organizational behavior, ''Somebody who is successful at getting resources in the family environment approaches the corporate environment with a sense of confidence. Someone who was denied resources given to others approaches the corporate environment with the same concept.'' 
 The use of personality testing in the workplace to measure employees' ''emotional intelligence'' or, for example, how they handle conflict, has become increasingly common, said Benjamin Dattner, an organizational psychologist in New York who consults with companies on workplace issues and blogs for Psychology Today. Tests such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator, which measures how people perceive the world and make decisions, are given to millions of employees each year, Dr. Dattner said. 
 The idea is to help increase their effectiveness, say, by having a team of co-workers better understand their strengths and weaknesses -- although the usefulness of such tests is debated. 
 There are also a number of character typology studies -- some frivolous and some more serious -- that have sought to define the roles office workers play. In one recent study that T-Mobile in Britain commissioned to gain insight into how its employees interact, a psychologist interviewed workers and came up with eight character types. When times are difficult economically, a workplace character identified as the ''mother hen'' -- with a comforting voice of reason and empathy -- may help raise the group's spirit, Honey Langcaster-James, a psychologist, concluded. The ''office joker,'' by contrast, ''may decide that wisecracking'' is ''no longer appropriate in such dire times.'' 
 The ''dude,'' another character in the study, ''T-Mobile Workplace Motivation Report,'' which is available online, is described as ''laid back and relaxed,'' and this relaxed attitude ''also means that he/she doesn't transfer pressure onto colleagues -- a trait most workmates would be grateful for,'' the report says.
 One New York company that has recently delved deeply into workplace roles and how family experiences and birth order affect relationships at the office is TAG Creative, a branding communication agency in Manhattan that is owned by three women.
 Last summer, the partners hired a team of consultants, including Dr. Dattner, who is also an adjunct professor of psychology at New York University, when they doubled their employees to 16. With twice as many personalities in the office, the three managers wanted to define more clearly their own roles. In the process, they uncovered how some of their childhood experiences and especially their birth order played out inside their sleek and small offices at 30th Street and Park Avenue. 
 ''I sometimes have to tell myself, she is not your mother, she's your partner,'' said Amy Frankel, 53, the chief strategy officer, referring to her two co-owners. 
 Both Ms. Frankel and her partner Terry Rieser, 58, the chief operating officer, are eldest children, and for them, an important motive in starting the company in 2001 was to be their own bosses. Like many other firstborns, they said, they are dominant personalities and have trouble with authority. 
 The third partner, Gina Delio, 52, the chief creative officer, is the second of five children. Her two partners describe her as the peacemaker of the group, true to middle-child form. 
 Ms. Rieser, whom her partners described as the most direct of the three, is often asked to handle difficult conversations with clients or employees. 
 The women gained some of their insights about how birth order plays out in the workplace from Dr. Dattner, who has studied its impact in the workplace. He says it can provide useful insights to employees trying to navigate difficult office relationships. 
 Firstborns, he said, tend to be fearful of losing their position and rank, so they may be extremely anxious at a time of layoffs and downsizing. Second-born children tend to be most adventurous and open to change, he said. In fact, Dr. Dattner said that companies he had worked with found that when sending employees overseas, second-born children tended to fare better than older ones. 
 As the older of two daughters, Ms. Frankel said she sometimes feels competitive with Ms. Delio, which reminds her of competing with her sister for their parents' attention. 
 ''I feel there are moments where you are sitting there and you can feel it in your body, you're having a reaction, something gets triggered,'' Ms. Frankel said. ''It took on so much more import than it needed to.''
 She added, ''And this is not really about Gina or Terry or what they are doing in this moment, this is reminding me of something that happened a long time ago that gets acted out there.''
 In the current recession, with corporate budgets shrinking, spending on psychological counseling at work is likely to be curtailed or eliminated, several business psychologists said. But other consultants said they are still receiving plenty of work from companies in crisis, particularly those facing the grim and emotional tasks of laying off employees or merging with other companies. 
 Heather Amber Anderson, a management consultant based in Stowe, Vt., who speaks regularly to large groups of chief executives of small- and medium-size companies, said she has been telling these executives for the last few months that examining their own and their employees roles and behavior at work is especially important now.
 ''This is more critical than ever,'' she said she has advised. ''People are watching you right now to set the emotional tenor of the organization. This is one of the most important conversations you need to have with yourself right now.'' 
 For the 50-something women who run TAG, where the employees are in their 20s, 30s and 40s, the possibility of having to lay off workers as the economic troubles squeeze their clients, feels very much like the specter of kicking their children out of the house.
 ''Having looked at what we may need to do to survive or how the trend in business is going, it's almost painful in that parental way,'' Ms. Rieser said, adding that one of the interns who worked for her called her ''mother.'' ''These are people who are dependent on you; these are people who depend on you for their livelihood.''
 One longtime company employee, Matthew Aldrich, who is the youngest of three brothers, feels very ''taken care of'' by the three partners, whom he calls ''the ladies.'' ''They look after me like a son,'' he said, adding that sometimes he even feels spoiled, reminding him somewhat of life in his family. ''It's a nurturing role.''

HEADLINE: Fed's Report Confirms Downturn Has Deepened

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; David Jolly contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The economic decline took a turn for the worse after the market shocks of October. In November, the problems only deepened. 
 Cash-poor Americans, fearful for their jobs and victims of a steep decline in stock prices, pulled back on spending. Businesses laid off workers, cut wages and reduced hours. Real estate developers and owners suffered. 
 That bleak portrait -- effectively a confirmation of the conventional wisdom of the last few weeks -- was released on Wednesday afternoon by the Federal Reserve in the latest edition of its beige book, a regular snapshot of economic conditions across the country. 
 Despite the drumbeat of bad news, though, Wall Street stayed relatively quiet, with stocks moving in and out of positive territory before climbing higher in the afternoon. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average ended higher by 172.6 points, its second consecutive triple-digit gain. The index closed at 8,591.69, up 2.1 percent, and is now nearly halfway recovered from Monday's big collapse.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 21.93 points, or 2.6 percent and the Nasdaq gained 42.58 points, or 2.9 percent.
 The Fed survey came just hours after equally grim news emerged about the American services sector, which makes up the bulk of the nation's economic output. November was the worst month for service industries in at least 11 years, according to a widely watched index from the Institute for Supply Management, which fell to a record low last month.
 Economists were also bracing for a report on the job market due Friday from the Labor Department. 
 A deep round of layoffs appeared to hit a broad range of businesses in November, and the beige book cited widespread job cuts and hiring freezes. 
 Manufacturing was hit hard in Dallas, and businesses in Boston, Richmond and Chicago said that demand for temporary workers rose last month.
 Some analysts now think that the economy may have lost 300,000 to 400,000 jobs in November alone, a decline that would make it the worst month yet in the current recession. The economy has shed 1.2 million jobs since the beginning of the year.
 At the root of the problems is a significant slowdown in spending, as Americans retreat from large-scale purchases and try to save money amid the worst downturn in a generation. Retail sales fell in most major cities, according to the beige book, while sales of automobiles ''deteriorated,'' particularly sales of more expensive cars like sport utility vehicles. 
 Compiled through surveys of businesses in 12 major metropolitan regions, the report concluded that overall economic activity weakened from the beginning of October to last week, when the survey period ended.
 ''Discount stores reported stronger sales volumes than department stores,'' the beige book said, and sales were lower for furniture, household appliances, electronics and luxury items. Many retailers are bracing for a painful holiday shopping season that could squeeze their margins further. 
 Manufacturing activity slowed last month in all 12 districts included in the beige book. Both residential and commercial real estate companies reported problems. Vacancy rates were higher in Boston, New York, Richmond, Chicago, Kansas City and San Francisco. 
 Lending by banks slowed as well, although Philadelphia banks said they issued more loans in November and Cleveland saw an uptick in loans for businesses.
 Inflation, however, has receded since the big drop in oil prices, which slipped again on Wednesday to $46.79 a barrel in New York trading.
 Businesses, accordingly, are no longer raising sticker prices for consumer items; in fact, many companies are now considering lowering their prices in the months to come.
 In a separate report on Wednesday, the Labor Department said the nation's productivity rose at an annual rate of 1.3 percent from July to September. That was down from the 3.6 percent growth rate in the second quarter.
 Shares in Europe ended higher on Wednesday. The FTSE 100 index in London gained 1.1 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris was 0.4 percent higher and the DAX in Frankfurt gained 0.8 percent.
 The 10-year Treasury note rose 4/32, to 109 15/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 2.66 percent, from 2.67 percent Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Lack of Preparedness Comes Brutally to Light

BYLINE: By ROBERT F. WORTH; Somini Sengupta and Jeremy Kahn contributed reporting.

DATELINE: MUMBAI, India 

 BODY:
In the wake of last week's devastating terrorist attacks here, one thing has become clear: India's security forces are so spectacularly unprepared, its intelligence agencies so riven by conflict and miscommunication, that it lacks the ability to respond adequately to such attacks, much less prevent them. 
 This nation of 1.2 billion has only a few hundred counterterrorism officials in its intelligence bureau. Its tiny, ill-paid police force has little training, few weapons and even less ammunition. The coast guard has fewer than 100 working boats for a shoreline nearly 5,000 miles long. 
 In the latest revelation of India's lack of preparedness, on Wednesday, a full week after the attacks, sniffer dogs discovered a bag with a 17-pound bomb that was left by the terrorists in the city's central train station and that was later deposited in a pile of lost bags, police officials said. The police defused the bomb on the spot and never bothered to clear the station, Victoria Terminus. It is also known as Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and is Mumbai's busiest train station. 
 Long before last week's attacks on Mumbai, which stunned the world and left 173 people dead, Indian intelligence officials and their Western counterparts had passed on various tips about the possibility of such assaults. But the Indians utterly lacked the ability to assess the significance of those tips or respond to them. 
 As a result, a group of just 10 attackers, according to the police, took the city by surprise on Nov. 26. They easily killed the police officers who opposed them and seized control of some of the city's best-known landmarks, as all of India watched in horror on television. 
 ''The scale of the task before us is colossal,'' said Ajai Sahni, a former Indian intelligence official and the executive director of the Institute for Conflict Management in Delhi. ''We are looking at a system which does not have the capacity to either generate adequate intelligence, or to respond to it.'' 
 Although India's prime minister, Manmohan Singh, has promised far-reaching reforms, earlier efforts to improve police training and effectiveness have gone nowhere. In any case, such efforts are unlikely to occur quickly in India's vast, corruption-riddled bureaucracy.
 That could leave India, a key American ally and one of the engines of global economic growth in the past decade, dangerously vulnerable to more terrorist strikes. 
 The Mumbai attacks have pushed tensions between India and Pakistan, where the gunmen are said to have been trained, to their highest level in years. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice flew to New Delhi on Wednesday and to Islamabad, Pakistan's capital, on Thursday in an effort to calm the situation. 
 The violence has also fed an unprecedented and broad-based rage at the Indian government for not having done more to protect its people. On Wednesday evening, tens of thousands in Mumbai marched near the attacked sites, chanting slogans that made their anger clear. Similar rallies were held in New Delhi and in the southern technology hubs of Bangalore and Hyderabad.
 Many Indians were stunned to discover how easily, and thoroughly, the group of militants initially overpowered the police who tried to stop them (all but one of the militants were eventually shot dead). The attackers all had AK-47 rifles and pistols, and plenty of ammunition -- far more firepower than any of the officers who confronted them. None of the police officers who initially encountered the terrorists had bulletproof vests, allowing the attackers to kill a number of them quickly, despite some heroic efforts at resistance. 
 Scenes from closed-circuit cameras, played endlessly on TV in the days after the attacks, showed police officers running from the gunmen alongside terrified civilians. In all, 20 police officers and commandos were killed.
 After the assault began on the night of Nov. 26, it took hours for the Indian commando squad to arrive in Mumbai because it is based near Delhi, hundreds of miles away, and does not have its own aircraft. Even after the commandos, who are better armed and trained than police officers are, began fighting the terrorists holed up in the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower hotel, they lacked a floor plan, whereas the militants seemed to know the hotel's layout well.
 In a sense, none of this was a surprise. India's National Security Guards force has only about 7,400 commandos, and it has often taken hours to respond to crises in the past, Mr. Sahni said. As for the city and state police forces, their equipment and training are far more meager, and they are lightly scattered across a vast population. India has 125 police officers for every 100,000 residents, one of the world's lowest ratios. 
 Intelligence failures also played a role in India's inability to deal properly with the Mumbai attacks. The United States warned Indian officials in mid-October of possible terrorist attacks on ''touristy areas frequented by Westerners'' in Mumbai, echoing other general alerts by Indian intelligence. In the past week, reports of other, far more detailed warnings have been rife in the Indian news media, though government officials have disputed them. 
 But the debate masks a broader problem, Mr. Sahni said: Neither the intelligence agencies nor the government has the ability to prioritize or assess those threats, or to act on them. The various wings of India's intelligence apparatus, like their American counterparts before the Sept. 11 attacks, are famous for failing to communicate and share intelligence. 
 In the wake of the attacks, some police officials have become remarkably outspoken and even angry about their inability to defend the citizenry or even themselves.
 ''You see this old musket? It is useless,'' said Ankush Hotkar, a police officer, as he stood Wednesday in the cavernous hall of the main train station. He was pointing to a battered old hunting rifle in the hands of one of his fellow officers. Mr. Hotkar himself, despite his 26 years in the Mumbai police force, carried only a lathi, the wooden or Lucite pole that most police officers here carry as their only weapon.
 ''The weapons they give us are no good, so policemen died,'' he said, his voice thick with anger.
 The Mumbai police are given scarcely any training and no opportunities to fire their weapons, Mr. Hotkar said. Starting salaries are 3,050 rupees a month, just over $60 -- not enough to live on, he added. 
 ''Maximum corruption is going on,'' Mr. Hotkar said wearily. 
 Mumbai's beat officers are not even issued individual radios to communicate with one another. Instead, they must find a nearby ''beat marshal,'' an officer on motorcycle who is equipped with a radio to report incidents, said Police Inspector Maniksingh P. Patil, an officer at a station house near the hotels that were attacked.
 The police officers who are assigned to guard political figures are generally much better trained and equipped, a point that has been the focus of outraged commentary in local newspapers here in the past week. 
 On Wednesday evening, a throng of angry people gathered near the Taj Mahal hotel, one of the buildings seized by the terrorists. As the demonstrators marched through the streets, many held up banners with slogans like ''No Protection, No Security'' and ''No Protection, No Vote.'' There were chants of ''Enough is enough!'' and promises that they would demand real change. 
 But as night fell, the rally dissolved, with many of the marchers straying away. One observer, Dezadd Dotiwalla, 24, seemed dismayed and said she saw the protest's disintegration as a symbol of the very complacency that the marchers were promising to overcome. 
 ''I sometimes wonder whether we deserve any better,'' he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 9, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the lack of preparedness by India's security forces for the attacks in Mumbai last month referred incorrectly to Ajai Sahni, an intelligence analyst who was quoted as saying that the country's task in addressing the problem is colossal. While Mr. Sahni is the executive director of the Institute for Conflict Management in New Delhi, as the article stated, he is not a former Indian intelligence official.

HEADLINE: A Rush Into Refinancing as Mortgage Rates Fall

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD; Edmund L. Andrews and Charles Duhigg contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The housing market may finally be getting some relief, with lower mortgage rates already encouraging refinancing and Treasury officials considering ways to entice new buyers.
Last week, the Federal Reserve announced that it would buy $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Mortgage rates immediately dropped, and that led to a surge in mortgage refinancing activity for the week -- even with the Thanksgiving holiday.
On Wednesday, people close to the discussions said that the Treasury had been talking with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac about ways to drive down mortgage rates to as low as 4.5 percent. That rate is about a percentage point lower than the going rates for such loans.
Any government efforts to jump-start the housing market have a number of obstacles, the biggest being borrowers' worries that the economic downturn will affect them. Meanwhile the best interest rates will go only to borrowers in sound financial shape. And even if the efforts go as planned, they may not help the most distressed homeowners. 
Still, the jump in refinancing activity showed that there was an appetite that could be whetted by lower rates. The Mortgage Bankers Association said its refinance index, which measures refinancing activity, tripled to 3,802.8 last week from the week before. The index was also 37.7 percent higher than in the same week a year ago. It was the largest increase in refinance applications in the survey's 18-year history, though it does not measure how many applications become loans.
Refinancing activity accounted for 69.1 percent of all mortgage applications submitted last week, up from 49.3 percent the week before.
''We did quadruple our normal volume last week,'' said Bob Walters, chief economist of Quicken Loans. ''We had loan officers staying past midnight to get back to all of the people that had been calling. There is still a silent majority of people who can refinance and qualify.''
Callers cited a variety of reasons for their new interest in refinancing, mortgage lenders said. But the main reason was that they wanted to lock in a lower mortgage rate and reduce their monthly costs in case they fell victim to the economic downturn. Others were looking to extract cash to pay down more expensive credit card debt, the lenders said, and some were trying to trade in their adjustable-rate mortgages for a fixed rate.
Annie Lu, 30, a nurse practitioner, said she called about refinancing when she heard that the economy was officially in a recession. She and her husband bought their house in Brooklyn about three years ago with a mortgage rate of 6.25 percent. She is hoping to qualify for a rate almost a percentage point lower. ''It is good to prepare for the worst, and nobody minds saving as much as we can,'' she said.
The Treasury's consideration of additional efforts to breathe life into the housing market was first reported on The Wall Street Journal's Web site. People familiar with the Treasury's plans said that Treasury officials had met with top executives at Fannie and Freddie last week but that neither had been notified that any steps were taken toward putting such a plan into effect. By one account, the new program would be available only to home buyers, not to people who simply want to refinance their existing loan at a lower rate.
But those looking to refinance are already eyeing the lower rates. ''Borrowers with reasonably good credit and a home that hasn't lost too much value are going to find mortgage money plentiful and readily available,'' said Brad Blackwell, national sales manager at Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.
As rates drop, more people, in theory, qualify for loans because their monthly principal and interest payments will be lower. But to qualify for the best rates, borrowers need to have impeccable credit -- or a credit score of 720 or higher -- as well as at least 10 to 20 percent of equity in their homes.
And while experts said they were heartened by the pickup in activity, the overall number of refinancings this year was expected to be only slightly more than a quarter of the volume at the height of the housing boom in 2003.
''It is not going to spike up rapidly or anywhere near as it has in the past because credit is still tight, the economy is still weak and there are fewer people that could refinance now than could before,'' said Celia Chen, senior director of housing economics at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''But the decline in rates will help those that can.''
For all the renewed interest in refinancing, about 12 million households, or 15 percent of owners of single-family homes, are not eligible. Their mortgages exceed the value of their home, Ms. Chen said.
Meanwhile, entire categories of loan products have been eliminated. Subprime loans are not available along with stated income loans, where borrowers do not have to fully document their income. That has limited the options for many small-business owners and other self-employed individuals. People with inconsistent or unpredictable incomes, like those who rely on commissions, are also affected.
''You can imagine how many inquiries we get where we are done just as soon as we are done talking,'' said Rick L. Dunham, vice president of Impact Mortgage Network in Mesa, Ariz., whose clients include small-business owners as well as individuals whose mortgages exceed the value of their home. ''So we go to the next step and say, 'O.K., your options are loan modification, short sale or nothing at all.' ''
Credit standards have also tightened, which has made it more expensive -- often prohibitively so -- for many individuals to get a loan. Generally, individuals need a credit score of 620 to qualify for a loan, but they have to pay a fee equivalent to about 2.75 percent of the loan amount, which can translate into a rate of about 1 percentage point higher than the best rate available. In some cases, these individuals can get a better deal through the Federal Housing Administration.
''For borrowers on the fringe -- low credit score, erratic documentation, high debt loads, et cetera -- mortgage money may actually be available but the other terms and conditions that need to be jumped to have access to that financing make it prohibitive,'' said Keith Gumbinger, vice president of the financial publisher HSH Associates.
Javier and Irina Lattanzio were motivated to refinance by the potential for monthly savings. Their strong credit history enabled them to refinance the $800,000 mortgage on their four-bedroom Manhattan apartment to a rate of about 5.6 percent. But the Lattanzios had to pay $70,000 so that their loan would qualify for conforming mortgage rates. Jumbo mortgages remain, on average, a full percentage point higher.

HEADLINE: Shopping, Cocktail in Hand

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
WITH a little planning, you can coordinate your holiday shopping with chocolate tastings, a free eyebrow shaping and maybe an ornament for your dog. Oh, anything's possible in New York during a recession. Stores are putting on a variety of events to keep customers in the mood. Sample sales are unusually plentiful. And merchants and restaurants in SoHo have organized a shopping night to raise money for the homeless.
 At Bergdorf Goodman on Saturday, Pamela Fiori, the editor of Town & Country, will sign copies of her book, ''Stolen Moments: The Photographs of Ronny Jaques.'' The photographs of Mr. Jaques, an overlooked talent, ran in American magazines in the 1940s and '50s. Ms. Fiori will be on the seventh floor from 2 to 4 p.m. How convenient! From 1 to 5 p.m. on the same floor, Le Maison du Chocolat will hold a tasting. 
 On six, Bergdorf will spice up a winter coat selection from Burberry and Yeohlee, among others, with hot apple cider and chocolate. That's Saturday, Dec. 6 and Dec. 13, from 2 to 6 p.m. On both Saturdays, a jazz trio will play in the men's store from 1 to 5 p.m., with refreshments. Two ornament creators will be in the store: Natalie Sarabella, Sunday, Dec. 7 and Dec. 14, from 1 to 5 p.m., on the seventh floor; and Ida Tjeknavorian-Schlossberg on Dec. 13 and Dec. 14, from 1 to 5 p.m. And on both Sundays, Vosges Chocolates will offer a tasting.
 For hard-to-please male shoppers, two cuff-link designers will be at the men's store: Lois Sasson, Dec. 9 from noon to 4 p.m., and Robin Rotenier, Dec. 11 from noon to 4 p.m.
 Speaking of guy stuff, Lord & Taylor will have a special shopping night Dec. 11, starting at 5 p.m., with Details and 1050 ESPN. Big spenders ($1,000 and up) will receive an iPod Touch. In advance of Macy's one-day sale on Saturday, the store will hold a Nascar event Dec. 4 at 5 p.m. with Dale Earnhardt Jr. to promote a line of Godinger crystal and barware. The first 100 guests to make a $150 purchase will get to meet the driver.
 Grooming always matters. On Dec. 4, at the BeneFit counter at Bloomingdale's, your eyebrows can receive attention. Shaping is complimentary to first-timers. The cast from ''13, a New Musical'' will perform Dec. 4 at 4:30 p.m. at Y.E.S. And on Dec. 5, Trish McEvoy will hold two makeup classes. Get yourself a new face for the holidays! For reservations: (212) 705-2202. In Bloomingdale's in SoHo on Dec. 4, there will be a daylong Mad for Marc by Marc Jacobs event, for resort and holiday clothes. Shoppers who spend $300 will receive a limited-edition T-shirt. Spend $500 or more and you get a Marc tote bag, too. 
 If you're not too dazzled by the snowflake light show at Saks, the store has fortifications in addition to events. Godiva will have a tasting Dec. 4 from 4 to 8 p.m. Cookie maker Yoko Moku will offer treats Dec. 6, from 1 to 5 p.m., and so will Tea Forte. That's on eight. On Dec. 11, cartoonists from The New Yorker will be on hand to sketch your portrait, from 1 to 4 p.m. They can be found on the main and eighth floors.
 Among the hip fall sample sales are Proenza Schouler, at 120 Walker Street, on Dec. 11 and 12; and Alexander Wang, at 386 Broadway. The Wang sale starts on Dec. 11, at 3 p.m., and runs over the next two days. Showroom Seven (263 11th Avenue), which reps labels like Orla Kiely and Erickson Beamon, will have a 10-day sale starting Dec. 8. Charlotte Ronson's fall sale (1071 Avenue of the Americas) will take place Dec. 10 through 12.
 The first SoHo Holiday Stroll takes place Dec. 11, from 6 to 11 p.m., with shopping discounts and complimentary drinks and hors d'oeuvres from participating merchants and restaurants like Balthazar, Bliss and Tommy Hilfiger. Strollers must purchase a $20 bracelet, which will qualify them for the discounts and goodies. For details: (212) 274-0550.

HEADLINE: Palestinian Rift and Arab Nations' Actions Bar Gazans From Pilgrimage to Mecca

BYLINE: By TAGHREED EL-KHODARY and ETHAN BRONNER; Taghreed El-Khodary reported from Gaza, and Ethan Bronner from Jerusalem.

DATELINE: GAZA 

 BODY:
For the first time since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war, no Palestinians from Gaza are making the sacred annual pilgrimage to Mecca this year because of a power struggle over which Palestinian government is legitimate.
 Saudi Arabia, which runs the pilgrimage, known as the hajj, sought to bolster the Palestinian Authority of the West Bank, run by President Mahmoud Abbas and backed by the West and Israel, by asking it to compose the list of pilgrims, 4,000 from the West Bank and 2,200 from Gaza. Egypt added its support by opening its border with Gaza to allow the pilgrims out. 
 The West Bank residents left two weeks ago but Hamas, the Islamist militant group that runs Gaza, insisted on submitting its own list of eligible Gazans. When the Saudis said they would not grant any of them visas, Hamas set up eight checkpoints along the route to the Egyptian border and barred passage to those on the other list. 
 Witnesses said the police used sticks to beat those who did not turn back. Five tourism company owners who dealt with the West Bank officials for the hajj were jailed by Hamas security men, according to Maher Amin, owner of another such company. 
 The result is that Gazans, isolated by an Israeli, Egyptian and Western closure for the past year and a half, now have another reason to feel besieged -- they are being deprived of the chance to perform one of the most basic duties of a Muslim, the Mecca pilgrimage.
 ''Even the Israelis never dared prevent the pilgrimage this way,'' Mr. Amin complained.
 When asked how they, an Islamic movement, could allow the hajj to become a weapon in a power struggle, Hamas officials said the responsibility lay elsewhere.
 ''They have been putting military and economic pressure on Gaza, but this is a new form of pressure,'' asserted Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas leader here. ''We will not give in.'' Since the hajj takes several days and ends early next week, there is no chance a compromise will be reached, he added.
 While the Hamas hold on power in Gaza has tightened significantly, Hamas is under growing pressure not only from Israel, which has stepped up military action here, and the Palestinian Authority, but from much of the Arab world as well after withdrawing from a Cairo-sponsored effort to reconcile it with Mr. Abbas's government. 
 That government, the Palestinian Authority, based in Ramallah, has been arresting Hamas activists across the West Bank as its security officials, newly trained by Jordan and sponsored by the United States, increase their activity there. It has also taken over Hamas charities and shopping malls in the West Bank cities of Hebron and Nablus, replacing their executives with loyalists.
 In the past couple of days, Mr. Abbas's government has also issued two threats -- that it would replace the Hamas officials who were elected to municipal and village councils in the West Bank in 2005 because their terms were ending, and that it would stop sending salaries to their idle employees in Gaza, thereby increasing the economic pressure here.
 Hamas says that all these steps prove that the Palestinian Authority is not serious about compromise and that therefore dialogue is impossible now. 
 Israel and Hamas are also eyeing each other warily because on Dec. 19 their six-month truce comes to an end, and neither is sure whether to renew it. For the past several weeks, both have violated its terms, with Hamas lobbing rockets into southern Israel, terrorizing and injuring dozens, and Israeli forces carrying out raids into Gaza, killing and wounding militants. 
 The exchanges began when Israel discovered a tunnel being dug from Gaza to Israel that it believed was to be used for seizing another Israeli soldier -- Hamas has already been holding a soldier, Cpl. Gilad Shalit, for more than two years. Israel destroyed the tunnel, killing six Hamas militants in the operation, leading Hamas to accuse it of breaking the truce. It retaliated with dozens of rockets and mortars. 
 For those Gazans who had waited eagerly to make the hajj and now are disappointed, there is widespread frustration. But they have also shown great resourcefulness.
 Asked what she would do now that her pilgrimage had been barred, Fayrooz Khozondor, 55, said she would do what the Prophet Muhammad did when he was prevented from making the hajj: ''I will slaughter the animal here in Gaza instead of in Mecca.''

HEADLINE: Restaurant Owners Charged On More Than 400 Counts

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE; Joel Stonington contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The owners of the two Saigon Grill restaurants in Manhattan were arrested Wednesday on more than 400 criminal charges, including violating minimum-wage laws, falsifying business records and defrauding the state's unemployment insurance system.
 Simon and Michelle Nget, the owners of the popular pan-Asian restaurants, pleaded not guilty to those charges as well as to charges of demanding illegal payments from their deliverymen, tampering with witnesses and creating fraudulent records to cover up their actions. 
 Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo announced the arrests of the Ngets, who have been locked in a two-year battle with 36 deliverymen that has included calls for a boycott, picketing in front of their restaurants and a judge's order for them to pay $4.6 million for wage violations. 
 Several deliverymen asserted that they usually worked more than 65 hours a week but were often paid only $520 a month, or less than $2 an hour, far less than the federal and state minimum wage.
 ''Like so many restaurants across New York City, Saigon Grill was run on the backs of its workers,'' Mr. Cuomo said in a statement. ''These workers allowed the business to thrive, and in exchange they were allegedly cheated out of wages, fined for ridiculous reasons'' and, he said, ''pulled into a painstaking ploy to cover it all up.''
 The charges involve the Saigon Grill restaurants on Amsterdam Avenue at 90th Street and on University Place at 12th Street -- which remain open -- as well as a Saigon Grill on Second Avenue at 88th Street that closed in 2006.
 One deliveryman at Saigon Grill, Yu Guan Ke, who worked at the uptown restaurant for more than a decade, said he was glad to see charges filed. ''I'm happy because what happened will serve notice to other restaurant owners that they should improve their working conditions,'' he said.
 At the arraignment in Manhattan Criminal Court, the Ngets' lawyer, S. Michael Weisberg, blamed the deliverymen for his clients' problems. 
 He said of the Ngets: ''They never underpaid their workers. Their workers are liars. They never cooked the books.''
 The deliverymen asserted -- and a federal judge agreed in his October ruling -- that the restaurants had illegally deducted from $20 to $200 of the workers' pay when they committed infractions like letting the restaurant door slam on their way out. 
 Mr. Cuomo's office said that the Ngets were each charged with 151 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, 45 counts of tampering with physical evidence, and 46 counts of offering a false instrument for filing. All are class E felonies, which carry a sentence of up to four years in prison. 
 Mr. Cuomo said that those charges were based on the Ngets' creation of fake payroll records that were furnished to the State Department of Labor during an investigation. His office said the charges involved the couple's attempt to reduce their unemployment insurance taxes by not reporting the employment of more than 65 people.
 Mr. Cuomo said that the charges against the Ngets included many related to minimum-wage violations: 11 counts of failure to pay wages, 127 counts of failing to keep records, and 16 counts of receiving kickbacks. 
 At the arraignment, Judge Felicia Mennin said the case would go to a grand jury on Monday. The prosecutors initially requested $150,000 bail for each defendant, but Judge Mennin reduced that to $50,000 bond for Mr. Nget and $20,000 bond for Mrs. Nget.
 In October, Magistrate Judge Michael H. Dolinger of United States District Court in Manhattan ruled that the Ngets often had not paid their deliverymen for all the hours worked, and that the couple often took illegal deductions from their pay. One of the deliverymen was awarded $328,000.

HEADLINE: Long Road Behind Him, Richardson Gets a Post

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
At some point during the long series of Democratic presidential debates, Bill Richardson came to realize that he was not exactly the center of attention. Most of the questions were going to the star candidates, and he began tuning out. 
 So when a moderator turned to him with a question on one occasion when he was not listening, he panicked -- until he was saved by the candidate next to him. ''Katrina!'' Barack Obama whispered. ''Katrina!'' Mr. Richardson then offered his response on the hurricane that had ravaged New Orleans. 
 ''He could have thrown me under the bus,'' Mr. Richardson later recalled, ''but he stood behind me.''
 Mr. Obama stood with him again Wednesday, in announcing here that Mr. Richardson, governor of New Mexico, was his choice for secretary of commerce. 
 For Mr. Richardson, who has gone from being the nation's most prominent Hispanic official to an afterthought on the presidential campaign trail, from a target of the angry Clinton camp to cabinet nominee of the president-elect, the journey has been tumultuous. His destination proved to be not the presidency, as he had hoped, or the vice presidency or secretary of state. But Mr. Obama said Wednesday that it was not a consolation prize, either. 
 ''Well,'' he said, flanked by Mr. Richardson, ''commerce secretary is a pretty good job, you know. It's a member of my key economic team that is going to be dealing with the most significant issue that America faces right now, and that is how do we put people back to work and rejuvenate the economy.''
 Mr. Richardson, 61, is the third defeated member of the Democratic presidential field to join the nascent administration, after Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, selected for secretary of state. It could get a little uncomfortable in the Cabinet Room when Mr. Richardson looks across the table at Mrs. Clinton, whose husband appointed him to high office only to see him endorse Mr. Obama instead of her last spring.
 In the end, though, Mrs. Clinton got the job he had wanted, so she can afford to move on. Certainly Mr. Richardson sounded ready to do so on Wednesday. ''There are some who speak of a team of rivals,'' he said. ''But I've never seen it that way. Past competitors, yes. But 'rivals' implies something harder-edged and less forgiving.''
 Mr. Richardson's path to the Obama cabinet has been long and winding. After being elected to the House in 1982, he earned a reputation as a diplomatic troubleshooter parachuting into danger zones to free prisoners or negotiate deals. President Bill Clinton made him ambassador to the United Nations and later secretary of energy.
 Along the way, Mr. Richardson became known for a gregarious drive as well as a taste for the limelight. In his memoir, he agreed with the 1992 Almanac of American Politics, which called him ''an ambitious and often pushy politician who has sometimes taken impolitic stands for no apparent reason except the conviction that they were right.'' George magazine, less kindly, ranked him a top-10 ''publicity hound.''
 His tenure at the Energy Department was marred by reports of nuclear security lapses at Los Alamos National Laboratory. At one contentious hearing, Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, told him that he would never again ''receive the support of the Senate of the United States for any office to which you might be appointed.''
 Al Gore passed him over for vice president in 2000, so Mr. Richardson returned to New Mexico to run for governor, at one point setting a Guinness Book world record by shaking 13,392 hands in eight hours. But he found little success at the presidential level this year. After dropping out, he grew a beard, a small act of defiance as he contemplated his future.
 Seeking his endorsement, the Clinton camp believed that he was holding out for a promise of appointment as secretary of state. When he backed Mr. Obama, he was compared to Judas by the Clinton adviser James Carville.
 Mr. Richardson denied such crass motives, citing instead Mr. Obama's ability ''to bridge our divisions as a nation.''
 Mr. Carville remains unconvinced. Asked about Wednesday's announcement, he said: ''I think it's fine. I've had my say on him. I was quoted accurately and in context.''
 Hispanic leaders had lobbied for Mr. Richardson, arguing that Latino voters were a vital part of the coalition that had brought Mr. Obama victory. The president-elect said Wednesday that he had picked Mr. Richardson because of his experience, not his ethnicity, but vowed to produce a diverse team. He has his eye on Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California, for United States trade representative.
 ''I think people are going to say this is one of the most diverse cabinets and White House staffs of all time,'' Mr. Obama said. ''But more importantly, they're going to say these are all people of outstanding qualifications and excellence.''
 For Mr. Richardson, it is time to return to the national stage. The beard is gone, much to the disappointment of Mr. Obama, who joked that ''I thought that whole Western rugged look was really working for him.''
 The commerce post may often be simply a plum for a fund-raiser, but it is nonetheless a step up the official chart. Assuming Mr. Byrd was wrong and the Senate confirms him, Mr. Richardson will be 10th in line for the presidency, up from 15th when he was energy secretary.
 And there are still rungs to climb, admirers say. ''This isn't the final stop for Bill Richardson,'' said Brian S. Colon, New Mexico Democratic chairman. ''I'd bet money on it.''

HEADLINE: Obama Names Richardson as Commerce Secretary

BYLINE: By BRIAN KNOWLTON

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama named Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico as his choice for secretary of commerce on Wednesday, pointedly denying that the job was a ''consolation prize'' for the two-time cabinet officer who had been considered a candidate for secretary of state. 
 ''Commerce secretary is a pretty good job,'' Mr. Obama said, after being asked by a Hispanic reporter about the appointment of Mr. Richardson to a post not considered among the cabinet's more prestigious or influential. 
 The president-elect said that his nominee would be dealing with the economy, the most significant issue facing the new administration, and added that ''his mixture of diplomatic experience, hands-on experience as governor, experience in the cabinet, experience in Congress, means that he is going to be a key strategist on all the issues that we work on.''
 ''I think the notion that somehow commerce secretary is not going to be central to everything we do is fundamentally mistaken.''
 In addition, Mr. Obama -- who has filled about half of his cabinet and White House staff jobs -- said that by the time he was done his administration would be seen as among the most diverse ever put together. 
 Mr. Richardson was the first cabinet nominee to be presented on his own by Mr. Obama rather than as part of a group, which some saw as a gesture of consolation. 
 For his part, Mr. Richardson vowed -- in Spanish as well as English -- to revive the nation's sagging economy. 
 Mr. Richardson, 61, has a resume of unusual breadth, having served as energy secretary and ambassador to the United Nations -- then a cabinet-level position -- under President Bill Clinton; as an informal envoy abroad during his seven terms as a member of Congress, and then as a two-term governor of New Mexico. 
 Having thrown his support to Mr. Obama shortly after ending his own presidential candidacy -- a source of raw feelings among the Clintons -- and then helping draw substantial Hispanic support for Mr. Obama, Mr. Richardson was expected by many Hispanic-Americans to be in line for a more high-power post.
 With Mr. Richardson at his side, Mr. Obama underscored his nominee's capabilities, saying that the governor had the background to help create ''green'' jobs, support U.S. exports and ''start laying the groundwork for long-term prosperity.''
 ''Bill has seen from just about every angle what makes our economy work and what keeps it from working better,'' Mr. Obama said as the two stood on the stage of a Chicago hotel ballroom where the president-elect has spent the last two weeks introducing members of his new team.
 Mr. Richardson, whose mother is Mexican-born, is the first nominee of Hispanic background to be named by Mr. Obama, and his appointment is viewed at least partly as a show of thanks to the country's Latino voters, and to Mr. Richardson for helping turn them out. Two-thirds of Hispanic voters supported Obama.
 As a congressman, Mr. Richardson had a penchant for undertaking unofficial diplomatic missions to places like North Korea, Sudan, Cuba and Iraq. He met in 1995 with Saddam Hussein, later admitting that his hands grew sweaty during the encounter, and persuaded the Iraqi president to free two Americans who had wandered into the country. 
 His international experience, persistence and good-humored style appear to prepare him well for a job that effectively makes him the point man for American business to the international community and an ambassador on trade issues. And his political skills are underlined by his popularity in New Mexico, where he was re-elected in 2006 with 69 percent of the vote. 
 But his resume is not entirely untainted. He was energy secretary when a firestorm erupted over accusations of Chinese spying at the nuclear weapons laboratories at Los Alamos and during the widely criticized prosecution of the scientist Wen Ho Lee -- issues that could come up during his confirmation hearings. All but one of the charges against Mr. Lee were dropped after a judge found significant problems with the government's case.
 A group of Chinese-American activists in California has launched a nationwide protest of the nomination because of the Wen Ho Lee matter, the San Jose Mercury-News reported Wednesday. The group's leaders said they do not expect to block the nomination, but were angered that Mr. Richardson had not acknowledged any serious errors in a case that they said cast a shadow over the patriotism of all Chinese-Americans.
 Mr. Richardson was also on the sidelines of Washington's biggest scandal of the period when it emerged that he had offered a job at the United Nations to Monica Lewinsky, the White House intern linked to President Clinton. Mr. Richardson denied that he had been ordered to do so.
 Mr. Obama also injected a light note into proceedings when asked about a beard that Mr. Richardson grew after suspending his presidential run but shaved off before Wednesday's announcement.
 ''I think it was a mistake for him to get rid of it,'' Mr. Obama said as Mr. Richardson looked on with a grin. ''I think that whole Western, rugged look was really working for him.''

HEADLINE: China Shuns Investments In West's Finance Sector

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
The chairman of China's sovereign wealth fund said on Wednesday that China had no plans for further investments in Western financial institutions, nor did it have any plans to ''save'' the world through economic policies. 
 The comments by Lou Jiwei, the chairman and chief executive of the China Investment Corporation, are the clearest signal yet that after taking heavy losses on initial investments in the Blackstone Group, Morgan Stanley and Barclays, state-run Chinese institutions have no appetite for further purchases in this sector. 
 ''Right now we do not have the courage to invest in financial institutions because we do not know what problems they may have,'' Mr. Lou said as part of a panel discussion on the second and final day of the Clinton Global Initiative conference here.
 Asked whether China might pursue economic policies aimed at saving the world, Mr. Lou said that the country's leaders had a narrower focus. ''China can only save herself because the scale of China is still rather small,'' he said, adding that while China has more people than any other country, economic output is still low enough that the Chinese economy is not yet big enough to have a big effect on the global economy. 
 ''If China can do a good job domestically, that is the best thing it can do for the world,'' he said. 
 Mr. Lou's comments represent the clearest statement yet that as global financial markets plunge and economies slow, the attention of China's leaders is turning inward. 
 For several months, there has been a noticeable difference between East and West in expectations of China. Financiers in the United States and Europe have frequently talked of ways to use China's $1.9 trillion in foreign exchange reserves to rescue Western banks, most recently with speculation that the China Investment Corporation might invest more money in Morgan Stanley, which ended up turning to Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group of Japan instead. 
 But financial leaders in Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, with closer links to decision makers in Beijing, have consistently maintained that having been burned on their initial financial sector investments, the Chinese are very leery of buying more. Mr. Lou confirmed this. 
 Similarly, Western economists have hoped that China will try to take the lead in rekindling economic growth around the world with heavier spending. But while China has already announced plans for a stimulus plan of $586 billion, most of that money is earmarked for the construction of highways and railroads, categories in which China's need for imports is fairly limited.
 President Hu Jintao warned at a government meeting last weekend that difficulties in the global economy threatened to undermine growth in China. 
 Laura Tyson, who served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Clinton, said at the same panel as Mr. Lou that the current crisis would give further impetus to Asia's rise in economic importance.
 ''It's going to accelerate the move of economic power to Asia,'' she said. ''It was under way before, but this will accelerate it.'' The China Investment Corporation has $200 billion and was initially expected to invest all of it overseas. But the fund has since made its largest investments shoring up the capital of banks in China. 
 Mr. Lou said that the sheer pace of new initiatives and new rules issued by Western regulatory agencies was disconcerting and made it even harder for him to choose worthwhile investments. ''If it is changing every week, how can you expect me to have confidence?'' he asked. 
 He did not rule out overseas investments, however, noting that, ''Right now, the value of many investments is underestimated.'' But he suggested that China might find some of its best opportunities in low-income countries. ''We don't want to look at only the advanced or developing countries, we also want to look at emerging markets.'' 
 The China Investment Corporation's first investment, in the Blackstone Group, has fared badly and attracted considerable criticism within China. The sovereign wealth fund paid $3 billion at $29.605 a share; the shares closed on Tuesday in New York at $5.34, for a loss of $2.46 billion, or 82 percent. 
 The China Investment Corporation also had heavy losses on its investment a year ago in Morgan Stanley, while value of the China Development Bank's stake in Barclays has plunged. 
 Like many Chinese officials lately, Mr. Lou expressed concern about rapidly slowing growth in American purchases of Chinese goods, which has led to large-scale layoffs at export-oriented factories in China, particularly in the Pearl River delta region near Hong Kong. He blamed a shortage of letters of credit from American banks, which he described as making it hard for American importers to obtain the money they need to buy Chinese goods even when they have ready buyers.
 ''Citibank, Morgan Stanley and the government, they are very tight on their credit, so even when there is demand, they can't make things happen,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Endowment Nose-Dives At Harvard

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
In a sign of the economic times, Harvard has sent a letter to its deans saying that the university's $36.9 billion endowment fund lost 22 percent of its value in the last four months and could decline as much as 30 percent by the end of the fiscal year on June 30. 
 Normally Harvard reports on the endowment's performance once a year, but the letter signed by the university's president, Drew Faust, and its executive vice president, Edward C. Forst, cited the ''current extraordinary circumstances'' as the rationale for providing an interim report. 
 Harvard depends on its endowment for about 35 percent of its operating budget, and some of its schools rely on endowment income to cover more than 50 percent of their expenses. As a result, the letter noted that the endowment's performance would have a significant impact on budgets. The decline, about $8 billion, does not capture the full extent of losses, the letter said, because some investments are harder to value and are valued only periodically. 
 For example, at the end of its fiscal 2008 year, Harvard said it had 11 percent of its holdings in private equity, 9 percent in timber and agriculture, and a comparable amount in real estate. Each sector has been hard hit in the current environment, but it is difficult to quantify the decline on a daily or monthly basis. Harvard noted that its private equity and real estate investments are managed externally. Experts say that those markdowns could prompt a decline of an additional three or four percentage points. 
 In addition, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down again in November. At the end of fiscal 2008 in June, Harvard had 12 percent in domestic stocks and a similar amount in foreign equities as well as 10 percent in emerging markets. Declines in those sectors could also have affected the endowment's results.
 At the end of fiscal 2008, Harvard said it planned to increase its private equity holdings by 2 percent. Instead, because of market turmoil and problems in the private equity market, the endowment has put $1.5 billion, about 38 percent of its private equity holdings, up for sale. But as many foundations and endowments do the same, it is unclear what such sales will fetch. 
 Jane Mendillo, who formerly ran the Wellesley endowment, assumed the head of Harvard's endowment in July. She was appointed in March, succeeding Mohamed A. El-Erian, a former managing director at Pacific Investment Management Company, who stayed two years before deciding to return to Pimco as a member of its senior management team. 
 Private equity funds have been a particular problem for nonprofit entities. They return cash periodically and require new cash commitments to finance ventures. But while there have been few returns, demands for new commitments have continued, which has put pressure on schools to come up with cash for an array of needs, including the school budget and private equity. 
 In their letter, Ms. Faust and Mr. Forst said that to have the cash necessary to meet demands and minimize risk, the school would issue ''a substantial amount of new taxable fixed-rate debt.'' Harvard also plans to convert a significant amount of short-term tax-exempt debt into bonds with longer maturities, so it can reduce its exposure to volatility and continue to finance operations and other priorities.
 The letter did not discuss the impact of the decline on the school's ambitious financial aid program. In December 2007, for example, Harvard said that as part of its program to attract applicants from different income groups, it would charge students from homes with incomes of $120,000 to $180,000 about 10 percent of their family household income per year, thereby subsidizing the $45,600 annual cost of attending. 
 A little more than half of its undergraduates receive some form of financial aid. At the time, the school said that the new plan meant Harvard would increase financial aid spending by the university to $120 million, from $98 million, annually. 
 Harvard, like other schools, is expected to be hurt by declines in other revenue streams, as well as the endowment. As families of students find themselves increasingly in need of financial aid, the revenue from tuition could fall.
 In addition, as the downturn puts strain on the government, federal grants and contracts for sponsored research are likely to encounter added stress.

HEADLINE: Medicine for the Job Market

BYLINE: By JONATHAN GRUBER. 
Jonathan Gruber is a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a board member of the Massachusetts Health Insurance Connector Authority.

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
 A CENTRAL feature of Barack Obama's presidential campaign was an aggressive plan to expand health insurance coverage by subsidizing low-income Americans and preventing discrimination against the ill. In recent weeks, Senators Max Baucus and Ted Kennedy have been working on a similar plan that might also require people to purchase insurance. Senators Ron Wyden and Bob Bennett are promoting a different approach that would largely replace our employer-sponsored health insurance system with new insurance-purchasing pools.
 What all of these plans have in common is the goal of covering every American. And all would require major new spending in the near term -- perhaps $100 billion a year or more. 
 Given the present need to address the economic crisis, many people say the government cannot afford a big investment in health care, that these plans are going nowhere fast. But this represents a false choice, because health care reform is good for our economy. 
 As the country slips into what is possibly the worst downturn since the Depression, nearly all experts agree that Washington should stimulate demand with new spending. And one of the most effective ways to spend would be to give states money to enroll more people in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Plan. This would free up state money for rebuilding roads and bridges and other public works projects -- spending that could create jobs. 
 Health care reform can be an engine of job growth in other ways, too. Most proposals call for investments in health information technology, including the computerization of patient medical records. During the campaign, for example, Mr. Obama proposed spending $50 billion on such technology. The hope is that computerized recordkeeping, and the improved sharing of information among doctors that it would enable, would improve the quality of patient care and perhaps also lower medical costs. More immediately, it would create jobs in the technology sector. After all, somebody would need to develop the computer systems and operate them for thousands of American health care providers. 
 Expanded insurance coverage would also drive demand for high-paying, rewarding jobs in health services. Most reform proposals emphasize primary care, much of which can be provided by nurse practitioners, registered nurses and physician's assistants. These jobs could provide a landing spot for workers who have lost jobs in other sectors of the economy.
 Fundamental health care reform would also stimulate more consumer spending, as previously uninsured families would no longer need to save every extra penny to cover a medical emergency. When the federal government expanded Medicaid in the 1990s, my own research has shown, the newly insured significantly increased their spending on consumer goods. 
 Universal health insurance coverage would also address economic problems that existed before this downturn began -- and that are likely to linger after growth resumes. In our current system, people who leave or lose their jobs often must go without insurance for months or years, and this discourages people from moving to positions where they could be more productive. Most reform proposals call for the creation of pools of insurance coverage that would guarantee access to high-quality, affordable care for people who are self-employed or out of work, increasing their mobility. 
 If this coverage focuses on disease prevention and wellness, it could also improve the health, and thereby the productivity, of the workforce. 
 In the long term, the greatest fiscal threat facing this nation is the growth in the costs of health care. These costs have more than tripled as a share of our economy since 1950, and show no signs of abating. The Congressional Budget Office recently projected that the share of the economy devoted to health care will double by 2050.
 Experts have yet to figure out how to restrain cost increases without sacrificing the quality of care that Americans demand. Yet cost control would be easier in an environment of universal coverage. Nations like the Netherlands and Switzerland, which have achieved universal coverage within a private insurance structure, control costs better than we do. And in my home state, Massachusetts, an ambitious plan to cover all residents has focused the attention of all stakeholders on the importance of controlling costs as a means of ensuring the plan's success in the long run. 
 These are challenging times. The economic crisis of 2008 has left politicians of all stripes in shock and unsure where to move next. But rather than sit back and lick our wounds, we must move toward healing them. Fundamental health care reform that features universal insurance coverage is an important place to start.

HEADLINE: Gloom, but Not Doom

 BODY:
There's been a fair amount of hand-wringing since the nation's intelligence community surveyed the world of 2025: America losing dominance; China and India rising; fierce competition for water, food and energy; increased danger that terrorists will get a nuclear weapon.
 That's all sobering. But the headlines from ''Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World,'' published by the National Intelligence Council, are not the whole story. 
 President-elect Barack Obama is inheriting a world that is more complicated and more frightening than the one George W. Bush found in 2001. But while the trends may be apparent, the end results are not inevitable. Decisions Mr. Obama and other leaders make will matter more.
 Take the assertion that the world is on a path to a multipolar system with China, India and Russia plus various businesses, tribes, religious groups -- even criminal networks -- vying for influence. 
 Commentators have been predicting this dreaded multipolarity since the end of the cold war. And Vice President Dick Cheney and former Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz notably vowed to do everything they could to head it off -- up to and including ensuring that close European allies never aspired to power and influence to rival the United States. 
 That arrogance and bullheadedness has instead weakened this country -- creating new enemies and making it harder to win cooperation on important challenges, like the fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. If there is one clear lesson from the last eight years, it is that bullying other countries -- and jockeying for zero-sum gains -- doesn't work. 
 It also is the new conventional wisdom that this will be the century of China or India. But both face serious economic, demographic and other challenges -- including the threat of terrorism, as the Mumbai attacks so tragically demonstrated. 
 A relative decline in power also does not mean that the United States will not remain powerful. This country can and must continue to lead. There will be a particular premium on quick, nimble and farsighted decision-making and cooperation. 
 Giving rising powers a bigger role -- in the United Nations Security Council, for instance -- could help persuade them to take more responsibility for problems like terrorism, climate change, nonproliferation and energy security. 
 The report suggests that Al Qaeda's indiscriminate use of violence and its failure to focus on problems like poverty and unemployment could diminish its appeal. But other extremist groups that curry favor with social programs will likely have more staying power. The next administration will have to counter their influence by promoting economic development in the Middle East as well as a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians. Warnings that terrorists will have an easier time acquiring nuclear, biological and advanced conventional weapons argue for serious new initiatives to control the spread of these horrifying weapons.
 Mr. Obama appears to understand the challenges. So do some of the experts who are expected to be part of his administration, including Susan Rice, his choice for ambassador to the United Nations, and James Steinberg, reported to be on the short list for deputy secretary of state. As members of a group called the Phoenix Initiative, they spent several years formulating a concept of American strategic leadership for the 21st century. 
 Their report on the concept states that ''leadership is not an entitlement; it has to be earned and sustained. Leadership that serves common goals is the best way to inspire the many different peoples of the world to make shared commitments.'' That is a good place to start.

HEADLINE: One Singular Sensation

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Ed Rendell can't believe that he's being asked about the fact that he said that Barack Obama's nominee for head of homeland security, Janet Napolitano, has ''no life.'' 
 ''We're facing the greatest crisis since the Depression, and you want to talk about this?'' he complained.
 This is exactly the kind of comment people used to make during the bad old days in New York, when cops ticketing cars for double-parking were always told that they should be out arresting murderous drug dealers. But what better time to have a diverting discussion about a governor's misadventure with an open microphone? Really, there's not much chance that we're going to forget the big picture. 
 Rendell, who is governor of Pennsylvania, was chatting about Napolitano, the governor of Arizona, at a governor's meeting (where else?) while lounging in the vicinity of a live mic. (They should put lights on those things that would flash red when they're turned on.) He was explaining that Napolitano was ''perfect'' for homeland security ''because, for that job, you have to have no life. Janet has no family. Perfect. She can devote, literally, 19-20 hours a day to it.''
 This seemed to be the summation of Napolitano's qualifications. Rendell himself has been on the list of Cabinet Mentions, and this is a good example of the way people around the world explain why another person got the prize instead: It was all about some random characteristic I happen to lack. (''Ted's perfect for the job. Because for that job, you really have to speak Estonian.'') Perhaps a rather undesirable characteristic. (''For that job, you have to be able to drink those salesmen under the table and Ted's an absolute lush.'') 
 And it sure sounded as if he was saying that single people like Napolitano exist in a state so dark and barren that the empty hours can only be filled up by guarding the nation's borders against terrorists and preparing for the next hurricane. 
 You will not be surprised that Rendell -- reached by phone in Pennsylvania and game as ever for conversation -- feels as though he's been totally, deeply and completely misunderstood.
 ''It was meant to include all workaholics,'' said Rendell, who is married with a grown son. ''I have no life. I'll give you a perfect example.'' He launched into a story about coming home late at night and watching a two-hour cable TV review of the Pennsylvania budget. Which actually, if you were a governor and it was your state's budget, might be kind of fascinating.
 ''I have no life either,'' he repeated. ''But I couldn't run Homeland Security because I don't have the background.'' It was about here, when he reached the exact opposite analysis from the one he made into the wrong microphone, that Rendell pointed out we were facing the greatest crisis since the Depression.
 All this was a real blow to Bella DePaulo, the author of ''Singled Out,'' who had recently posted on her blog, celebrating the fact that after Napolitano's nomination was announced, ''I haven't found any hints of singlism'' in the articles about her.
 ''Oh, no!'' she said, when reached by telephone Wednesday morning.
 DePaulo says that ''singlism'' -- a term she coined and for which we are prepared to forgive her -- is not just aimed at unmarried women. She referred to an MSNBC interview that Chris Matthews had with the presidential candidate Ralph Nader in 2004, in which Matthews demanded to know how Nader could say George W. Bush was irresponsible: ''He's raised two daughters; he's had a happy marriage. Isn't he more mature in his lifestyle than you are?'' 
 This did seem strange, since there are so many excellent reasons unrelated to marital status why Ralph Nader would make a terrible president. (The list does not, however, include ''likely to let the big financial firms ruin the economy due to lack of regulation.'') To be fair, Matthews also asked Nader if the fact that he did not own a car meant that he had not ''had an American experience.'' 
 But it's unmarried women at the top who often wind up portrayed as vestal virgins who live only to serve their chief executive. (Condoleezza Rice's public image is so extreme that people must be wondering if she plans to immolate herself on the White House lawn during the inauguration.) Instead of being celebrated for their achievements, they wind up regarded as slightly fanatic. 
 And single women comprise between 43 percent and 51 percent of the adult women in the country, depending on how you count. They are universally regarded as folks with time on their hands, and thus the most likely recruits for taking care of aged parents, adjusting their schedules to accommodate their married friends and working overtime. ''Employers ask you to cover for everyone else,'' said DePaulo. 
 Which actually makes them sound busier than their married peers. So perhaps single Americans have too much life. It's a wonder they have time for anything.

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Issues Rules on Conflicts in Credit Rating

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Federal regulators on Wednesday adopted new rules designed to stem conflicts of interest and provide more transparency for Wall Street's credit-rating industry, widely faulted for its role in the subprime mortgage debacle and ensuing credit crisis.
 The action by the five-member Securities and Exchange Commission was another government response touching on the global financial crisis set off by mortgage securities. The commissioners voted unanimously at a public meeting to adopt the new rules, most of which will take effect in about 60 days. 
 The S.E.C. chairman, Christopher Cox, called adoption of the new rules ''a significant and substantive action'' that affects every aspect of the rating agency business and will give the investing public access to a trove of new information while promoting needed competition in the industry. After nearly a century of policing itself, the industry came under S.E.C. oversight through a 2007 law.
 But the S.E.C. commissioners did not adopt a controversial proposal floated last spring to require ratings of complex securities, such as those underpinned by mortgages, student loans or auto loans, to be distinguished by a special identifier from those for more traditional securities like corporate or municipal bonds. That proposal drew opposition from Wall Street.
 European Union regulators, who last month put forward strict new rules for the rating agencies that would hold them liable for their opinions, also proposed a similar system of flagging complex securities. Mr. Cox said after the meeting that the proposal would be subject to further study by the S.E.C. and public comment.
 The three firms that dominate the $5 billion-a-year industry -- Standard & Poor's , Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings -- have been widely criticized for failing to identify risks in subprime mortgage investments, whose collapse helped set off the global financial crisis.
 The rating agencies had to downgrade thousands of securities backed by mortgages as home-loan delinquencies have soared and the value of those investments plummeted. The downgrades have contributed to hundreds of billions in losses and writedowns at major banks and investment firms.
 Some critics, including investor advocates, say the S.E.C. rules don't go far enough. They want new requirements to govern how the rating agencies are paid and to provide for the suspension of their licenses if they engage in unfair practices.
 ''Any steps they take to further reduce conflicts of interest are critical to reforming the industry,'' said Jeff Glenzer, managing director of the Association for Financial Professionals, a group representing finance officials at U.S. corporations that has been active on the issue.
 Some recommendations the group made to the S.E.C., such as requiring strict separation at rating agencies between credit analysts and employees responsible for generating revenue, weren't adopted, Mr. Glenzer said.
 The rating agencies are crucial financial gatekeepers, issuing ratings on the creditworthiness of public companies and securities. Their grades can be key factors in determining a company's ability to raise or borrow money, and at what cost which securities will be purchased by banks, mutual funds, state pension funds or local governments.
 The S.E.C. commissioners last June proposed the new rules and opened them to public comment.
 Among other things, the conflict-of-interest rules ban the rating agencies from advising investment banks on how to package securities to secure favorable ratings. Gifts over $25 from clients also will be prohibited.
 Rating agencies will be banned from making ratings in cases where the agency made recommendations to the company issuing securities or the investment bank underwriting them concerning the corporate structure, assets or activities of the issuing company.
 In addition, rating agencies will be required to disclose statistics on all their upgrades and downgrades for each asset type. They also will have to disclose how much verification they performed on the quality of complex securities in determining ratings for them.
 Investors will receive detailed information on the ratings process for complex securities, thereby exposing potential conflicts of interest for the agencies, S.E.C. officials said.
 The commissioners also voted to propose and open to public comment other rules that would require rating agencies to disclose in interactive electronic format the ratings history information for all of their assessments that companies issuing the securities pay them to do.
 Spokesmen for Fitch, Moody's and S.&P. on Wednesday said they supported the S.E.C.'s efforts, already have taken steps to increase transparency and will continue to make further enhancements in the future.

HEADLINE: Proposal Ties Economic Stimulus to Energy Savings

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama and leaders in Congress are fashioning a plan to pour billions of dollars into a jobs program to jolt the economy and lay the groundwork for a more energy-efficient one.
 The details and cost of the so-called green-jobs program are still unclear, but a senior Obama aide, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a work in progress, said it would probably include the weatherizing of hundreds of thousands of homes, the installation of ''smart meters'' to monitor and reduce home energy use, and billions of dollars in grants to state and local governments for mass transit and infrastructure projects.
 The green component of the much larger stimulus plan would cost at least $15 billion a year, and perhaps considerably more, depending on how the projects were defined, aides working on the package said.
 During the campaign, Mr. Obama supported a measure to address global warming by capping carbon emissions while allowing companies to buy and trade pollution permits. He said he would devote $150 billion of the revenue from the sale of those permits over 10 years to energy efficiency and alternative energy projects to wean the nation from fuels that are the main causes of the heating the atmosphere. 
 But the Obama adviser who discussed the green energy project said Mr. Obama would not await passage of a global warming bill before embarking on the new energy and infrastructure spending. House and Senate supporters of a climate bill said they would continue working on legislative language but did not expect quick action on a cap-and-trade law because of the economic emergency.
 That means that the green-jobs program would not be financed with pollution credits bought by power generators and other carbon emitters, but instead would be added to the budget deficit.
 Congressional officials working with the Obama administration said the stimulus program was also likely to involve tax breaks or direct government subsidies for a variety of clean energy projects, including solar arrays, wind farms, advanced biofuels and technology to capture carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants.
 The programs will be a part of a larger economic stimulus package whose outlines are faint but which is expected to cost $400 billion to $500 billion. Mr. Obama has said that his goal is to create or save 2.5 million jobs in the next two years. He has assigned to his economic and environmental advisers the task of devising a proposal that is expected to combine a shot of new federal money into existing federal and state programs and the possible creation of agencies modeled on New Deal public works programs. 
 ''We'll put people back to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, modernizing schools that are failing our children, and building wind farms and solar panels, fuel-efficient cars and the alternative energy technologies that can free us from our dependence on foreign oil and keep our economy competitive in the years ahead,'' Mr. Obama said in a radio address last month, echoing a campaign promise with a new sense of urgency.
 The political climate seems favorable to an economic stimulus plan, but large sums of new money touch off lobbying frenzies and energy projects spur debate between conservationists and those who want to more fully exploit domestic sources of oil, natural gas and coal.
 Some experts said the record of government's intervention in energy markets and new technologies was not promising, citing as a spectacular example the Carter-era Synthetic Fuels Corporation, which spent more than $3 billion without producing any commercially usable amount of coal-based liquid fuel.
 Ethanol and other non-oil-based fuels have also not proved their commercial value, in some cases yielding less energy than was needed to produce them, or, in ethanol's case, diverting land to corn and driving up food prices. 
 The plan could also face resistance from fiscal hawks. In 2004, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, almost single-handedly blocked a $100 billion energy package, saying the billions of dollars in subsidies for ethanol and other alternative fuels were little more than a special-interest boondoggle. The bill was revived a year later at half the cost, and much of the money in it has not been spent.
 ''Now they're talking about some large amount of money -- what, $100 billion? -- and spending it on windmills, job training, whatever,'' said David Kreutzer, who studies energy economics and climate change at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group. ''But where do you get the $100 billion in the first place? Are you going to take $100 billion from some other part of the economy, are you going to tax some people to pay for it? Are you just going to print it or borrow it? The money has to come from somewhere.''
 The Obama team and Congressional leaders say they want a plan ready shortly after Congress reconvenes in January.
 Mr. Obama has said that, after stabilizing the economy and the markets, putting the nation on the path to a more energy-efficient future is his top priority. The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, said this week that rebuilding infrastructure and creating green jobs was ''the first order of business that we will have'' when Congress reconvenes in January. Several hearings are planned even before Mr. Obama takes office on Jan. 20.
 State officials say a lack of financing has stalled billions of dollars in projects. Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger of California told Mr. Obama this week that the states were ready to break ground with $136 billion in infrastructure projects that could provide new jobs within two years.
 The American Public Transportation Association, which represents local mass transit authorities, said there were $8 billion in ''ready-to-go'' projects that could preserve or create thousands of jobs and provide more energy-efficient transportation. 
 Beverly A. Scott, the chief executive of Atlanta's transit agency and head of the national association, told Congress in October that the projects included diesel-electric hybrid buses for Chicago; a new bus maintenance shop for Eugene, Ore.; and a set of crossover tracks to allow San Francisco's rapid transit trains to turn around more quickly and carry more riders.
 The Obama aide said the residential smart meters were a relatively small project that would not create a large number of jobs, but the aide said they would be an essential building block for the electric grid of the future. The new grid -- a multiyear, multibillion-dollar project -- would more efficiently move electricity from its source to its destination and would reward those who saved power or used it during off-peak hours.
 Senator Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, who heads the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said he was sympathetic to Mr. Obama's desire to pump up the economy and reduce energy usage. But Mr. Bingaman said he was wary of big government spending programs without sufficient oversight or expertise.
 ''Just buying smart meters for everybody doesn't really move the ball very far,'' said Mr. Bingaman, who will hold a hearing next week to gather ideas for energy-related stimulus spending. ''Realistically speaking, getting money properly spent in a short period of time requires some degree of competence in the government agency doing it. The best plan is to start with existing programs that work, like weatherization, and build on those.''

HEADLINE: At Bank, Obama Aide Made Money and Ties

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
In late 1998, while Washington was in the throes of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, Rahm Emanuel, a departing senior political aide to President Bill Clinton, ventured out to an elegant restaurant in Dupont Circle for something of a job interview.
 John Simpson, who ran the Chicago office of the investment banking boutique Wasserstein Perella & Company, had flown to Washington to meet with Mr. Emanuel at the behest of Mr. Simpson's boss, Bruce Wasserstein, a major Democratic donor and renowned Wall Street dealmaker who had gotten to know Mr. Emanuel.
 ''I had this idea that this could work and that it had upside,'' said Mr. Wasserstein, now chairman and chief executive of Lazard, the investment bank. ''It worked out better than I could have hoped.''
 And better than Mr. Emanuel could have imagined as well. Over the course of a three-hour-plus dinner, Mr. Simpson and Mr. Emanuel discussed how they might work together. Shortly afterward, Mr. Emanuel accepted an offer, nudging him down what has by now become a well-trodden gilded path out of politics and into the lucrative world of business. 
 Mr. Emanuel, who was chosen last month to become President-elect Barack Obama's White House chief of staff, went on to make more than $18 million in just two-and-a-half years, turning many of his contacts in his substantial political Rolodex into paying clients and directing his negotiating prowess and trademark intensity to mergers and acquisitions. He also benefited from the opportune sale of Wasserstein Perella to a German bank, helping him to an unusually large payout.
 The period before he was elected to a House seat from Illinois is a little-known episode of Mr. Emanuel's biography. Former colleagues said the insight it afforded him on the financial services sector is invaluable especially now. But Mr. Emanuel built up strong ties with an industry now at the heart of the economic crisis, one that will be girding for a pitched lobbying battle next year as the incoming Democratic administration considers a potentially sweeping regulatory overhaul. 
 After Mr. Emanuel left banking to run for Congress, members of the securities and investment industry became his biggest backers, donating more than $1.5 million to his campaigns dating back to 2002, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. 
 Mr. Emanuel also leaned heavily upon the industry while he was chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the 2006 midterm elections. Financial industry donors contributed more than $5.8 million to the committee, behind only retirees.
 Friends of Mr. Emanuel's from his private-sector days said he still checks in with them regularly to plumb their insights on economic issues.
 ''He asks me what am I seeing, what business is like, what's the climate, where are the weak spots,'' said John A. Canning Jr., chairman of Madison Dearborn Partners, a Chicago private equity firm that is in the same building as Wasserstein's offices.
 Mr. Canning was one of many financial executives Mr. Emanuel met with soon after he left the White House to discuss job prospects, with Mr. Emanuel's political connections often opening doors. Mr. Canning agreed to sit down with Mr. Emanuel at the recommendation of several friends, including Stanley S. Shuman, an investment banker at Allen & Company and a major Democratic donor who once stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House as a guest of President Clinton's. 
 Mr. Canning could not offer him a job, but Mr. Emanuel came to pitch deals to him and they became friends. Employees of that particular firm became Mr. Emanuel's biggest financial supporters in Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
 When the House was weighing a measure last year to significantly increase the tax rate on profits earned by private equity firms, Mr. Canning said Mr. Emanuel attended a luncheon with Madison Dearborn executives, first reported by Bloomberg News, to listen to their arguments against the changes. 
 Mr. Emanuel, however, wound up joining other Democrats in voting for the measure.
 In an interview, Mr. Emanuel, pointed to other actions he had taken over the objections of the financial industry, including sponsoring a bill last year to curb the ability of hedge fund managers to defer paying taxes on compensation they stashed in offshore tax havens and another measure that imposed new reporting requirements on financial firms for what investors pay on stocks and mutual funds.
 ''I would say I've been as tough on my friends as others,'' Mr. Emanuel said. ''I call it like I see it.''
 Confidants of Mr. Emanuel's said he decided to try his hand at business because he wanted financial security for his family, before eventually returning to public service.
 ''He had a number in his head to make enough for the family,'' said Ezekiel J. Emanuel, one of Rahm's two brothers and a prominent bioethicist at the National Institutes of Health. 
 It was Morton L. Janklow, the literary agent for several former presidents, who introduced Mr. Emanuel to Mr. Wasserstein. Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff and a former investment banker, also said he recommended Mr. Emanuel. Mr. Emanuel met in Mr. Wasserstein in his New York office, where they had a wide-ranging discussion about the future of financial regulation, as well as Mr. Emanuel's plans.
 Jeffrey A. Rosen, now deputy chairman of Lazard and a former managing director of Wasserstein Perella's international practice, said Mr. Emanuel was ''both a developed and a raw talent.''
 ''His years in the White House and what he'd done before that really honed what I'd call deal-making instincts, which could be easily translated into the business arena,'' Mr. Rosen said. ''Plus, he was someone who was well connected in Chicago and highly respected.''
 Mr. Emanuel turned out to be an effective banker, proving a quick study with financial concepts, even as he relied on others in his office for heavy number crunching, former colleagues said. He worked 12-hour days and was known among clients for his relentlessness, constantly on the phone or sending e-mail, and being unafraid to pitch deals. Revenue in Wasserstein's Chicago office climbed significantly after his arrival.
 There is no evidence Mr. Emanuel used his political clout on behalf of his clients, but his connections certainly helped drum up business and contributed to his hiring, former colleagues said. Indeed, a partial list of clients from Mr. Emanuel's Congressional financial disclosure in 2002 is easily linked up to the various strands of his political career, including his time as a fund-raiser for Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago and then for Mr. Clinton's first presidential run. 
 The clients included Loral Space & Communications, run by Bernard L. Schwartz, one of the Democratic Party's biggest donors, who said he got to know Mr. Emanuel while he was in the White House; the Chicago Board Options Exchange, whose chairman and chief executive, William J. Brodsky, became friends with Mr. Emanuel while he was working for Mayor Daley; and Avolar, a business aviation company whose top executive, Stuart I. Oran, was formerly in charge of governmental affairs for United Airlines, a role in which he said he interacted with Mr. Emanuel at the White House.
 One of Mr. Emanuel's major deals was the purchase in 2001 of a home alarm business, SecurityLink, from SBC Communications, the telecommunications company that was run by William M. Daley, the former secretary of commerce in the Clinton administration and the brother of Chicago's mayor. 
 Mr. Emanuel represented GTCR Golder Rauner, a Chicago private equity firm that was buying the business for an affiliate. Bruce Rauner, the firm's chairman, had first met Mr. Emanuel when he was still exploring job prospects in Chicago after getting a call from Mr. Bowles, an old friend.
 Instead of private equity, Mr. Rauner advised Mr. Emanuel to pursue investment banking, where his political experience might be more valuable in landing deals in regulated industries. 
 Mr. Emanuel called him back after starting at Wasserstein and asked if he could take over coverage of GTCR for his new employer. That eventually led to the nearly $500 million SecurityLink deal.
 Mr. Emanuel's biggest transaction came in late 1999 when he landed an advisory role for Wasserstein in the $8.2 billion merger of two utility companies, Unicom, the parent company of Commonwealth Edison, and Peco Energy, to create Exelon, now one of the nation's largest power companies. 
 John W. Rowe, the former chief executive of Unicom who now holds the same position at Exelon, sought out Mr. Emanuel after he went to Wasserstein. Mr. Rowe said he believed Mr. Emanuel would offer a different dimension, providing wisdom on what might pass muster at the governmental level.
 ''You can't understand utility transactions without thinking about whether they'll play or not play in legal and political circles,'' said Mr. Rowe, who was first introduced to Mr. Emanuel by Lester Crown, the billionaire scion of Chicago's influential Crown family.
 Tax returns Mr. Emanuel released while first running for office and reported in news articles, along with Congressional financial disclosures, reveal his steep financial ascent while working at Wasserstein. He earned more than $900,000 in 1999, his first year at the firm; nearly $1.4 million in 2000; and $6.5 million in 2001, when he left the firm in midyear to run for Congress. He collected $9.7 million more from the firm in deferred compensation in 2002.
 Mr. Emanuel's annual salary was not especially large but his hefty paydays came from bonuses for the business he brought in, as is customary in investment banking, along with the company's sale in 2001 to the German Dresdner Bank, which allowed him to benefit from an equity stake, as well a large retention bonus paid to him based on his prior performance.
 The bonanza Mr. Emanuel reaped would come in handy when he ran for the House seat vacated by Representative Rod R. Blagojevich, now governor. 
 Mr. Emanuel contributed $450,000 out of his own pocket to his campaign in the primary, and his leading rival accused him of trying to buy a seat in Congress.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Are Weakest In 35 Years

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
The nation's retailers turned in the worst sales figures in at least a generation on Thursday, starting the holiday shopping season with double-digit declines across a broad spectrum of stores. 
 For many chains, the precipitous sales drops that took hold in September and October got worse, not better, in November, despite relatively strong sales in the few days after Thanksgiving.
 The International Council of Shopping Centers, an industry group, described November's figures as the weakest in more than 35 years. Declines were recorded in every retail segment the group tracks, with the biggest coming from department stores, with sales down 13.3 percent compared with November a year ago, and specialty apparel retailers, down 10.4 percent. 
 Some retailers, though, have begun to figure out how to manage in the bleak environment, selling huge amounts of merchandise at steep discounts to generate cash. That will erode profits, of course. Department store profits will most likely plummet 20 to 60 percent in the final three months of the year, said Bill Dreher, senior retailing analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. But retailers who are unloading merchandise early in the season are at least demonstrating an ability to take control. 
 ''Even if they're giving away the product, it reduces inventory levels and keeps the problem from continuing,'' Mr. Dreher said. ''It shows retailers are being disciplined.'' 
 Retail stocks rallied Thursday as investors interpreted the sales report as showing that, with sufficient discounts, goods can be sold in volume despite the poor economy. The Standard & Poor's retail index rose 1.5 percent.
 The discounts being dangled by stores are the biggest retailing analysts have ever seen. ''When did you ever see, on Dec. 1, 70 percent off apparel on the high end?'' said Claire Gruppo, managing director of Gruppo, Levey & Company, a New York investment bank. ''You just don't.'' 
 Any retailer that refused to trot out jaw-dropping bargains in November paid the price. 
 For example, Abercrombie & Fitch, the chain that uses sexy bodies in seductive poses to sell clothes to teenagers and young adults, has refused to get on the discount bandwagon. In November, sales at stores open at least a year, an important measure of retail health, fell a whopping 28 percent for the company, in contrast to a 2 percent increase for the period a year ago. 
 That is a far worse decline than previous months: Sales at Abercrombie & Fitch stores open at least a year were down 14 percent in September and 20 percent in October. 
 Saks, on the other hand, has driven consumers into shopping frenzies with eye-popping deals on luxury names like the Armani Collezioni and Zac Posen. The tactic worked: In November, Saks had only a 5.2 percent decline in sales at stores open at least a year, clawing its way up from months of double-digit declines.
 Other stores that improved their lot in November took a page from the same playbook. Neiman Marcus, for example, has also been selling luxury goods at startling discounts. Sales at Neiman Marcus stores open at least a year fell 11.8 percent in November -- better than the 15.8 percent drop in September and the 27.6 percent dive in October.
 ''If you don't understand the consumer and his mood right now and you're doing things as usual,'' said Walter Loeb, president of Loeb Associates, a consultant firm, ''you're not going to get any business.'' 
 Stunning declines have become the norm in retailing since sales first plunged in September amid the financial crisis. The November figures indicate the downturn is migrating to some discount and warehouse stores, some of which even had sales growth in October. 
 Ken Perkins, president of Retail Metrics, a research firm, said either Wal-Mart Stores was stealing market share from its bargain competitors or the whole sector was softening. 
 At Target, sales at stores open at least a year tumbled 10.4 percent, in contrast to a 10.8 percent increase a year ago. Sales at Target were down 3 percent in September and 4.8 percent in October. 
 Sales at Kohl's stores open at least a year sank 17.5 percent, in contrast to a 10.2 percent increase last year. Sales at Kohl's stores dropped 5.5 percent in September and 9 percent in October. Sales at Costco were down 5 percent in November after a 7 percent increase in September and a 1 percent dip in October. 
 Even some stores with October sales increases lost their edge in November. Children's Place, which had a 4 percent sales increase in October, sank 7 percent in November. Aeropostale, which was up 1 percent in October, was down 5 percent in November. 
 Of all the major retailers, only Wal-Mart and BJ's Wholesale Club, two of the country's best-known discount chains, thrived, in part because of robust grocery sales. Wal-Mart, in fact, enjoyed the biggest grocery sales spike in its history. 
 With new lines of brand-name merchandise from makers like Sony and Samsung, and with rock-bottom prices and an ability to move high volumes of merchandise, Wal-Mart seems to have cornered the market on Christmas this year.
 The company began the critical holiday season by exceeding expectations. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 3.4 percent in November, not including fuel, compared with a 1.5 percent increase a year ago.
 (The company made a point of being subdued in its sales announcement, noting its sadness that a worker, Jdimytai Damour, had been trampled to death at a Wal-Mart in Valley Stream, N.Y., when rowdy shoppers burst through the doors on Black Friday.) 
 Sales at BJ's Wholesale Club stores were up 4.1 percent in November, not including fuel, compared with a 7.7 percent increase a year ago. 
 Many retailers were buoyed by sales over Black Friday weekend, which increased about 0.9 percent, compared with a 6.5 percent increase last year, according to ShopperTrak, a research firm. Yet the weekend after Thanksgiving did not account for the majority of retailers' November sales. Results for the month were weakened, many people in retailing said, by the calendar -- a later Thanksgiving this year meant fewer post-Thanksgiving shopping days in November.
 ''The Thanksgiving weekend improvement was not enough to significantly alter the month's outcome,'' Linda M. Farthing, president and chief executive of Stein Mart, said in a statement on Thursday. ''We expect to continue aggressive promotional activity through the remainder of the year.''
 It was a plan echoed on Thursday by other retailers, like American Eagle Outfitters and Kohl's. 
 John D. Morris, an analyst with Wachovia whose Holiday Sale Rack Index tracks promotions at specialty mall retailers, said discounts were up 12 percent compared with last year. That may not sound like much, but it is the biggest jump in the decade-long history of the index. Usually, a big promotional period sends the index up 5 percent. 
 ''It's a terrible story for retailers and their margins,'' said Michael Unger, a principal with Archstone Consulting. ''But if you're a consumer looking for a good deal, you will find it.''

HEADLINE: Strangers May Cheer You Up, Study Says

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

 BODY:
How happy you are may depend on how happy your friends' friends' friends are, even if you don't know them at all. 
 And a cheery next-door neighbor has more effect on your happiness than your spouse's mood. 
 So says a new study that followed a large group of people for 20 years. 
 ''Your happiness depends not just on your choices and actions, but also on the choices and actions of people you don't even know who are one, two and three degrees removed from you,'' said Dr. Nicholas A. Christakis, a physician and social scientist at Harvard Medical School and an author of the study, to be published Friday in BMJ, a British journal. ''There's kind of an emotional quiet riot that occurs and takes on a life of its own, that people themselves may be unaware of.''
 In fact, said his co-author, James H. Fowler, an associate professor of political science at University of California, San Diego, their research found that ''if your friend's friend's friend becomes happy, that has a bigger impact on you being happy than putting an extra $5,000 in your pocket.''
 The researchers analyzed information on the happiness of 4,739 people and their connections with several thousand others -- spouses, relatives, close friends, neighbors and co-workers -- from 1983 to 2003.
 ''It's extremely important and interesting work,'' said Daniel Kahneman, an emeritus psychologist and Nobel laureate at Princeton, who was not involved in the study. Several social scientists and economists praised the data and analysis, but raised possible limitations.
 Steven Durlauf, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, questioned whether the study proved that people became happy because of their social contacts or some unrelated reason.
 Dr. Kahneman said unless the findings were replicated, he could not accept that a spouse's happiness had less impact than a next-door neighbor. Dr. Christakis believes that indicates that people take emotional cues from their own gender. 
 A study also to be published Friday in BMJ, by Ethan Cohen-Cole, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Jason M. Fletcher, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, criticizes the methodology of the Christakis-Fowler team, saying that it is possible to find what look like social contagion effects with conditions like acne, headaches and height, but that those effects disappear when other factors are considered.
 A BMJ editorial about the two studies called the Christakis-Fowler study ''groundbreaking,'' but said ''future work is needed to verify the presence and strength of these associations.'' The team previously published studies concluding that obesity and quitting smoking are socially contagious. 
 But the happiness study, financed by the National Institute on Aging, may be more surprising. What about pleasure in someone's misery or envy when a friend lands a promotion? ''There may be some people who become unhappy when their friends become happy, but we found that more people become happy over all,'' Dr. Christakis said. 
 John T. Cacioppo, director of the University of Chicago's Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience, who was not involved in the study, said the results suggest that unconscious signals of well-being packed more zing than conscious feelings of resentment. ''I might be jealous of the fact that they won the lottery, but they're in such a good mood that I walk away feeling happier without even being aware that they were the site for my happiness,'' he said.
 The subtle transmission of emotion may explain other findings, too. In the obesity and smoking cessation studies, friends were influential even if they lived far away. But the effect on happiness was much greater from friends, siblings or neighbors who lived nearby. 
 A next-door neighbor's joy increased one's chance of being happy by 34 percent, but a neighbor down the block had no effect. A friend living half a mile away was good for a 42 percent bounce, but the effect was almost half that for a friend two miles away. A friend in a different community altogether can win an Oscar without making you feel better. ''You have to see them and be in physical and temporal proximity,'' Dr. Christakis said. 
 Still, the researchers said, it is not clear if increased communication via e-mail messages and Webcams may eventually lessen the distance effect. In a separate study of 1,700 Facebook profiles, they found that people smiling in their photographs had more Facebook friends and that more of those friends were smiling. 
 The BMJ study used data from the federal Framingham Heart Study, which began following people in Framingham, Mass., after World War II and ultimately followed their children and grandchildren. Beginning in 1983, participants periodically completed questionnaires. 
 They also listed family members, close friends and workplaces, so researchers could track them over time. Many of those associates were Framingham participants who also completed questionnaires, giving Dr. Christakis and Professor Fowler about 50,000 social ties to analyze. They found that when people changed from unhappy to happy in self-reported responses on a widely used measure of well-being, other people in their social network became happy too. 
 Happiness also has a shelf life, the researchers found. ''Your happiness affects my happiness only if you've become happy in the last year,'' Dr. Christakis said. Another surprising finding was that a joyful coworker did not lift the spirits of colleagues, unless they were friends. Professor Fowler believes inherent competition at work might cancel out a happy colleague's positive vibes.
 The researchers cautioned that social contacts were less important to happiness than someone's personal circumstances. But the effect of social contacts even three degrees removed -- friends of friends of friends -- was clear. 
 People in the center of social networks were happier than those on the fringes. 
 So should you dump melancholy friends? The authors say no. Better to spread happiness to people you know. 
 ''This now makes me feel so much more responsible that I know that if I come home in a bad mood I'm not only affecting my wife and son but my son's best friend or my wife's mother,'' Professor Fowler said. 
 When heading home, he said, ''I now intentionally put on my favorite song.''
 Still, he said, ''We are not giving you the advice to start smiling at everyone you meet in New York. That would be dangerous.''

HEADLINE: Slick and Styling: Provocative Poses

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

DATELINE: Barkley L. Hendricks did not birth the cool 

 BODY:
-- that was Miles Davis -- but his suave portraits from the 1960s, '70s and early '80s give him the right to use ''Birth of the Cool'' as the title of his five-decade retrospective at the Studio Museum in Harlem. 
 Mixing realism, abstraction and Pop, Mr. Hendricks's life-size paintings of beautiful black people in extravagantly fashionable outfits against flat, single-color backgrounds captured a period sensibility with uncanny acuity. They also made him famous: he was included in numerous museum exhibitions and featured in a Dewar's Scotch magazine advertisement. 
 Today, with figurative art resurgent and portrait painters like Kehinde Wiley, Elizabeth Peyton and Chuck Close enjoying great popularity, Mr. Hendricks's work is back in style. The exhibition was organized by Trevor Schoonmaker, curator of contemporary art at the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, where it appeared earlier this year. 
 Mr. Hendricks's spirit is epitomized in a self-portrait called ''Slick'' from 1977, in which the bearded artist appears shirtless in a snowy-white, double-breasted suit against a matte, slightly off-white background. He wears a colorful African skullcap and a fine gold necklace with a little votive leg hanging from it, has a toothpick jutting from one side of his mouth and gazes back at us through gold-rimmed glasses with a calm, appraising mien. He is perfectly composed in all senses of the word.
 Many complexities unfold from what might seem at first to be a fairly straightforward picture. The clothes bring to mind cinematic, disco-era associations: ''Shaft,'' ''Saturday Night Fever.'' The skullcap evokes the period's surge of Afro-centric pride and the influence of African art on European Modernism. 
 There is the formal tension between the dimensional figure and the flat, white rectangle. Mr. Hendricks, who was born in 1945, came of age when formalist abstraction ruled, and artists like Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt and Robert Ryman were revered. The flat, monochrome rectangles that surround many of his figures wed the modern to the traditional. Perhaps Wayne Thiebaud's deadpan paintings of people against blank backgrounds were an inspiration. Alex Katz's way with figuration and abstraction was surely an influence too. And it's not too much of a stretch to think of Kazimir Malevich's seminal pure abstraction of 1918, ''White on White.''
 The first painting in this exhibition that shows clearly where Mr. Hendricks was headed is a head-and-shoulders portrait of a young African-American soldier, whose olive-green helmet and shirt harmonize with the bright-green background. It was 1968, and Mr. Hendricks was serving in the National Guard a year after graduating from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and two years before he would head for Yale, where he would earn his Master of Fine Arts in 1972.
 Besides its finely tuned formal qualities, the painting of the soldier is historically arresting. You can't help but think about Vietnam and the disproportionate number of African-Americans who fought and died there. It makes no explicit statement about the war; nor does it overtly comment on the racial strife at that time. But because the young soldier has his eyes meditatively closed in the shadow of his helmet's brim, and because the painting allows the viewer mental space to reflect on its implications, it has a haunting resonance. 
 That Mr. Hendricks was keenly aware of how paintings play in the socio-political arena is shown most conspicuously in a full-frontal self-portrait from 1977 in which he is wearing only sports socks and sneakers, some jewelry, glasses and a white leather applejack hat. The title is ''Brilliantly Endowed,'' a double-entendre that plays on a favorable review of Mr. Hendricks's work by Hilton Kramer, then an art critic for The New York Times, who wrote that Mr. Hendricks was a ''brilliantly endowed'' painter. With understated economy, the painting mocks American fantasies about the black male body. 
 But the clothed body would be Mr. Hendricks's signature subject. His interest as a portraitist was not in private selves but in public personae. See, for example, ''Sir Charles, Alias Willie Harris'' (1972), whose subject, in a play on the Three Graces, appears in triplicate -- facing right, left and into the background -- wearing a scarlet trench coat, black suit, white turtleneck and two-tone wingtips. 
 Mr. Hendricks toys ambiguously with stock associations. Hollywood stereotypes of disreputable characters often played by black actors -- pimp, drug dealer, gangster -- come to mind. On the other hand, Sir Charles could be a magazine fashion model or a real-life dandy. So there is a provocative connection between the individual person and Pop culture -- much enhanced by the unspoken background of racial craziness in America. 
 Some people seem more real. In ''Sweet Thang (Lynn Jenkins)'' the subject reclines on a couch blowing bubble gum. A young woman named Tequila in a 1978 painting has a look all her own: in loose, bright-red below-the-knee shorts, canvas basketball sneakers, striped athletic socks, a wide-collared sailor shirt, denim jacket and a long-billed cap, she poses with one fist on her hip, a cigarette in her other hand and an amused, slightly skeptical expression.
 Mr. Hendricks, who has taught at Connecticut College since 1972, stopped making his large figurative paintings in the early '80s and for the next two decades devoted himself to outdoor landscape painting during vacations in Jamaica. A half-dozen of those small works on oval and lunette canvases are included, but they are not nearly as captivating as his portraits. (Excluded from this all-painting exhibition is Mr. Hendricks's considerable work in photography.)
 Recently he has returned to life-size portraiture, and the exhibition includes an example from 2002. An image of the African pop star Fela Kuti performing in an orange track suit with a gold halo over his head against a golden, tapestrylike field, it has a wide, wooden frame and a collection of high-heel shoes on the floor in front of it representing the singer's 27 wives, or ''queens.'' You can imagine a series of hagiographic tributes to other artists following from this, but for now Mr. Hendricks's most memorable achievement remains his early pictures of coolness personified.
 ''Barkley L. Hendricks: Birth of the Cool'' is at the Studio Museum in Harlem, 144 West 125 Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org, through March 15.

PERSON: Dorothy Sterling 

HEADLINE: Dorothy Sterling, 95, Children's Author

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Dorothy Sterling, whose more than 35 books for children and adults included some of the first nonfiction works about black history for young readers, notably ''Freedom Train,'' about Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad, died on Monday at her home in Wellfleet, Mass. She was 95. 
 The death was confirmed by her daughter, Anne Fausto-Sterling. 
 A New Yorker with a passion for trees, flowers and bugs, Ms. Sterling found many of her subjects while following up on questions about the natural world posed by her two children. While casting about for a biographical subject, she found inspiration in Tubman and her work for the Underground Railroad, which led to the groundbreaking ''Freedom Train'' in 1954, as the civil rights movement gathered momentum. Her research for that book using the Schomburg collection of the New York Public Library resulted in a series of books designed to introduce young readers to black history. These included ''Captain of the Planter: The Story of Robert Smalls'' (1958), about a former slave who captured a Confederate gunboat and later became a congressman from South Carolina, and ''Lucretia Mott: Gentle Warrior'' (1964), a biography of that Quaker abolitionist.
 ''I had found a subject about which I cared deeply,'' Ms. Sterling wrote for the reference work ''Something About the Author.'' ''At the age of 40, I had finally become a writer.''
 Dorothy Dannenberg was born in Manhattan in 1913. A precocious student, she was plucked from Public School 46 in Washington Heights and placed in a special class for gifted students at a school farther downtown. She later attended the Dalton School and, at 15, won entrance to Wellesley College. She found it disappointing and transferred to Barnard, where she received a bachelor's degree in 1934, just in time to enter the ranks of the unemployed. 
 While working for the Federal Writers' Project she met and married Philip Sterling, an unemployed journalist and later an author, who died in 1989. In addition to her daughter, Anne, of Providence, R.I., she is survived by a son, Peter, of Philadelphia; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.
 In the 1940s, Ms. Sterling worked for Life as a researcher, but left in frustration at a system under which women, as researchers, fed material to men, who got the bylines. In the early 1950s she began writing books for children, starting with ''Sophie and Her Puppies'' (1951), a Life-style photo essay about the family dogs. Determined to write the biography of a strong woman who could inspire girls, she found her way to Tubman and discovered a new field of research.
 ''I was excited, but also bewildered and angry,'' she wrote. ''Why had I never heard of Harriet Tubman or Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass or William Lloyd Garrison? Here was a wealth of information, dozens of inspiring stories to tell to young readers.''
 Ms. Sterling wrote two books on black history for children, ''Forever Free: The Story of the Emancipation Proclamation'' (1963) and ''It Started in Montgomery'' (1972), and many more for young adults, notably ''Tear Down the Walls!: A History of the American Civil Rights Movement'' (1968) and ''Black Foremothers: Three Lives'' (1979). 
 She also wrote, for adults, ''Tender Warriors'' (1958), about students entering previously segregated schools. The book, based on interviews she conducted on a tour of the South in 1957, provided raw material for ''Mary Jane'' (1959), a young-adult novel. 
 Her last book was a political memoir, ''Close to My Heart'' (2005), which included an account of a successful late-life crusade on behalf of local shellfishers whose access to the beaches of Wellfleet was being blocked by wealthy homeowners. Ms. Sterling, who had moved to Wellfleet in the early 1970s, allowed the shellfishers to use her right of access. The stretch of beach at the end of her road is now officially named Sterling Path.

HEADLINE: A Turn To the East

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON

 BODY:
IF a vacation is meant to be an escape from real-life woes, like a collapsing economy, how should we approach that looming American rite of winter, the weeklong -- or even weekend -- ski trip?
 For those who live in the Northeast, that annual trip out West is looking especially expensive, and extra airline fees for every piddling service are not helping. In times like these, people usually look closer to home for their fun. Not surprisingly, winter resorts throughout New York and New England are reporting 10 to 20 percent gains in early bookings and sales of season passes, compared with last year.
 But for skiers accustomed to the larger, more comprehensive Western resorts like Vail and Jackson Hole, there may be a sense of loss. To be honest, that Western experience can't be replicated in every way, but with some strategic planning, that trip can be imitated. And it can be done in a car filled with all your gear.
 For this exercise, I have chosen a small swath of north-central Vermont where an urban couple, a suburban family or roommates from a college dorm suite could settle in for a few days or a week and with a little imagination, capture the all-inclusive feel of a Western trip. 
 You want isolation and powdery glades? Have you ever been to Jay Peak, just five miles from the Canadian border? Jay Peak had more than 400 inches of snow last season. And Jay Peak had powder -- I saw my skis disappear in it -- last weekend.
 You want craggy, adrenaline-charged challenges? Have you stepped off the Sugarbush resort's intimidating Castlerock chair, where the trails are rocky, bumpy and will get you airborne? Have you stepped off just about any lift at the no-frills Mad River Glen, home of the ''Ski It If You Can'' bumper stickers?
 You want opulence and pampering? Stowe has three high-end accommodations with extensive spas, including the new Stowe Mountain Lodge. And Sugarbush recently opened its own refined, ski-in, ski-out hotel, the Clay Brook.
 If you delight in the snowboarding ban at Deer Valley in Utah -- a touchy subject in most parts -- you will be comforted to know that a snowboarding prohibition is not controversial at Mad River Glen, where a repeal of the ban never even comes to a vote.
 As for family programs, on the opposite side of Spruce Peak from Stowe is Smugglers' Notch, the resort voted No. 1 in North America for family activities -- for 10 of the last 11 years -- in Ski magazine's annual readers' survey.
 Most of these areas and resorts are no more than an hour's drive from each other. Only Jay Peak is more distant, 35 to 70 miles from the others, but worth the trip if you have an adventurer's spirit. Each resort is six or so hours by car from Manhattan.
 NORTH-CENTRAL Vermont is not the only place where this kind of closer-to-home ski trip can be planned for skiers and riders in the Northeastern United States. Indeed, there is evidence that many Eastern-based snow sliders have been of a like mind lately.
 Season-pass sales are up at the Sugarloaf and Sunday River resorts in Maine, at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire and nearby Cannon Mountain, where preseason season pass sales increased nearly 100 percent this year.
 ''People have passions they are going to pursue, even if they pursue them less extravagantly,'' said Byron Carlock, president and chief executive of CNL Lifestyle Properties, which owns 10 ski resorts, including Bretton Woods and Loon Mountain in New Hampshire, and Sugarloaf and Sunday River. ''This season's increases in pass sales prove that people will look for drive-to opportunities before they will give up the chance to make lasting family memories.''
 So while a trip to north-central Vermont is far from the only option, there are factors that make it especially suitable, like the variety and flexibility of the resorts collectively.
 Let's start with Stowe, the best known of the group, with famed trails that cut across Vermont's tallest peak, Mount Mansfield (4,393 feet). There is little that Stowe cannot provide a guest: a historic and challenging ski experience, many off-mountain activities, the romance of a picturesque New England village and lodging at various prices. If the plan is to go resort hopping, then Stowe can be a home base.
 These are changing times at Stowe, which has been building its first base camp, plaza or village. The focal point of that development is the Stowe Mountain Lodge, a spectacular architectural addition reminiscent of the grand, sweeping Western lodges but with Vermont touches of natural wood and stone. 
 The lodge has all the prized amenities, including a spa, fitness center and a larger-than-normal outdoor heated pool with dedicated swimming lanes. IPod ports in rooms are a nice touch. 
 Mountain Road, which connects the ski area with the village of Stowe, is an opportunity to sample all the other faces of Stowe. You can't go wrong stopping at the Matterhorn (www.matterhornbar.com), a favorite apres-ski and late-night gathering place. Or, make your way to Ye Olde England Inne (www.englandinn.com), where there are elegant rooms, suites and cottages for lodging and the most welcoming atmosphere of any restaurant in town, at Mr. Pickwick's. Maybe it's the selection of more than 150 fine and rare ales, lagers and stouts that puts everyone at ease there.
 At the intersection of Mountain Road and Route 100 is the made-for-strolling Stowe village, anchored by the Green Mountain Inn (www.greenmountaininn.com), where the broadcaster Lowell Thomas delivered regular radio addresses promoting America's budding, pre-World War II skiing industry.
 If Stowe is the best-known resort in the region, then Jay Peak may be the least known. Its base lodges are dated, and nearby accommodations are limited and generally not high-end. But no one comes for luxury. 
 Jay Peak is known for its tree runs, for abundant backcountry opportunities and for the peculiar weather phenomenon known as the Jay Cloud, which rewards this very large mountain with gobs of snow. The concept is that passing clouds seem to hover above the mountain. 
 Jay Peak is not particularly easy to get to, but there are benefits to that. Its trails are devoid of whiners and the fashion police. The runs are long, twisting and old school. Everyone ends up snow-covered and smiling at the bottom. 
 It's a great day trip, or for some real Vermont color, stay in one of the local inns. If you are in college, or want to relive your college days, try Grampa Grunts Lodge in Montgomery Center (www.grampagrunts.com). It can accommodate, as its advertising boasts, ''63 college age students.'' It's spartan, costs $35 a night a person with an all-you-can-eat breakfast and has a B.Y.O.B. lounge, pool table, fireplace and a hard-core following.
 Groupings of a different kind gravitate toward Smugglers' Notch, the resort just north of Stowe that has perfected the family winter trip. 
 Smuggs, as it is called, always had the surroundings, with three diverse peaks. But it solidified its reputation as a family destination about 10 years ago during a snowless Christmas week. Not sure what to do with a resort full of families, it turned two indoor tennis courts into a fun zone of giant inflatable slides.
 Customers were so pleased that the resort created a permanent, and bigger, fun zone with more games and rides. Then it added a center for teenagers, a tubing hill and an ice-skating area, and branched out to nighttime torchlight parades, fireworks and magic acts. 
 The lifts are slow, and the frenetic pace of the place is not for everyone. But the big, challenging mountains are still there for the adults, who get some peace when the kids are occupied.
 About 40 miles south of Smugglers' Notch, a different kind of crowd was making Sugarbush a household name in skiing 50 years ago. Known as Mascara Mountain for its jet-setting, Manhattan-based clientele, Sugarbush was celebrated for terrain that suited all levels of ability, and for its rich, party atmosphere. 
 The glamour of the place faded by the 1980s, but the last decade has been a time of gleaming rebirth.
 The new base lodge and high-end hotel helps, but with gentle slopes for kids, cruisers for the aging knees of baby boomers, and insane steeps and cat skiing for the daring, Sugarbush has a soul and history removed from the rest. Nestled in the Mad River Valley, it is a comfortable place to settle for a few days. 
 It doesn't draw the numbers that Stowe does, and it doesn't yearn to, giving it a little of a feel that Robert Frost would refer to as ''the road less traveled.'' 
 IF Sugarbush has a smooth, slightly sophisticated vibe, Mad River Glen is its raw, organic next-door neighbor. From its dirt parking lot to its single-chair lift, Mad River Glen has an unaltered spirit not substantially changed since it opened in 1948.
 Want to know what it was like to ski in Vermont when your father and uncles went there in the 1950s? Just ride the meditative single chair and pick any trail. If there's some bark missing from one of the exposed tree stumps, the gash might have been caused by your father's old wood skis.
 Lodging is strictly of the mom-and-pop ski lodge variety, which can be a great, classic Vermont experience; just don't ask for the menu of spa treatments. Mad River Glen is also a terrific change of pace if you are staying at Sugarbush's Clay Brook complex.
 Everyone should see Mad River Glen at least once. If you accept the attitude and relish the character it takes to remain unchanged, you will grasp and revel in the authenticity of the place -- and make lots of friends in its homey slopeside bar, General Stark's Pub.
 Mad River Glen also has something few of its Eastern contemporaries can claim. It is so different and intriguing that it is one of the few ski areas that Westerners regularly fly east to experience.
 Of course, that was before the economy tanked.

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
The chip maker Advanced Micro Devices warned on Thursday that fourth-quarter revenue would be much weaker than expected because of sluggish demand, particularly among consumers. 
 A.M.D. said it expected revenue from continuing operations for the fourth quarter, which ends Dec. 27, to decline 25 percent from the third quarter, to about $1.19 billion.
 The average analyst fourth-quarter revenue estimate is $1.52 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.
 A.M.D. previously forecast fourth-quarter revenue to be flat when compared with the third quarter.
 Chip makers are starting to feel the fallout from the global economic slowdown, as businesses cut costs and trim technology spending, and consumers hold off on purchases.
 At an analyst meeting in November, A.M.D. stood by its financial forecast, even as its main rival, the Intel Corporation, slashed its fourth-quarter outlook.
 Shares of A.M.D., which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., fell 12 cents, to $2.08.

AROUND TOWN
 BOWIEBALL
 The economy is tanking, the winter doldrums are setting in, and the tourists and the family are descending, but don't let that bring you down: pull yourself up by your skinny jeans and hit BowieBall, a glittery, wild-haired, wild-eyed party in honor of the Thin White Duke, in all his gender-bending glory. 
 Deryck Todd, an artist, fashion designer and David Bowie lover, came up with the idea a few years ago when he was casting about for a party theme. (''I'm a big fan of alliteration,'' Mr. Todd, 28, said.) It was an instant hit: by the second ball, at Don Hill's, there was a line around the block, and the event has been attracting the zip-up-jumpsuit crowd ever since. ''It's gay, it's straight, it's bi, it's hipster, it's people who are trying to get in with a fake ID, and people who saw Bowie in 1968 in London,'' Mr. Todd said. He added, ''Bowie gave a voice to so many people, to inspire them to be individuals, to challenge who they are, to pretend they are from other planets and get away with it.'' 
 So far, there have been no actual Bowie sightings, but doppelgangers -- above -- abound. This year's ball, the sixth, has a half-dozen D.J.'s -- including the downtown mainstay Michael T. -- burlesque and drag performances, and appearances by people in the Ziggy Stardust orbit, like Earl Slick, Mr. Bowie's original guitarist.
 For the first time there will be a fashion installation, with mannequins decked out in Bowie-inspired garb by designers like Stephen Burrows and Richie Rich; Stella B. Zotis, a contestant on last season's ''Project Runway,'' will serve as a host. There is, of course, a dress code: the themes are Warholian superstar, young American heroes or Goblin Kings. Though the doorman can be fierce, there are options for the casual ''Space Oddity'' fan -- the party offers a glam makeup station (think major applications of eye shadow and lightning bolts.) ''If you come and you're not wearing any pleather, and for some reason you're wearing pleated khakis-- which I really hope they're not -- they can get a makeover and fit in for one night,'' Mr. Todd said. ''Fit in with the un-fitters.''
 (Saturday from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., Santos Party House, 100 Lafayette Street, at Walker Street, Lower Manhattan; $10 with RSVP to bowieballnyc.com; $15 on ticketweb.com; $20 on the day of the event.) MELENA RYZIK

''If you come and you're not wearing any pleather, and for some reason you're wearing pleated khakis-- which I really hope they're not -- they can get a makeover and fit in for one night,'' Mr. Todd said. ''Fit in with the un-fitters.''
 (Saturday from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., Santos Party House, 100 Lafayette Street, at Walker Street, Lower Manhattan; $10 with RSVP to bowieballnyc.com; $15 on ticketweb.com; $20 on the day of the event.) MELENA RYZIK

HEADLINE: Legal Duel Could Make High-Tech Boat a Relic

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
Already looking suspiciously like a relic of an era of excess, the massive black trimaran sailboat belonging to BMW Oracle Racing was docked in San Diego harbor last week, its towering mast giving the high-rise hotels some competition.
 ''I'm staying on the 13th floor, and I'm not at the mast yet,'' said the skipper, Russell Coutts, gesturing at his hotel between bites of a sandwich. ''I'm looking down from the hotel thinking, 'Wow, that's what it must look like from the top of that thing.' '' 
 That thing -- dubbed Dogzilla by the sailing community -- is the latest high-tech racing machine created at great if undisclosed expense with the America's Cup in mind. It has been clocked at speeds twice that of the wind. 
 But with a long-running lawsuit continuing to generate much more drag than this leviathan's computer-designed hulls, it is anybody's guess whether BMW Oracle's monster three-hulled boat will ever be used in the Cup.
 If BMW Oracle wins an appeal in the New York courts sometime next year, the team may race its trimaran against one being designed by Alinghi, the defender of the America's Cup, in a one-on-one series under the rules outlined in the Cup's governing document, the Deed of Gift. 
 In Cup parlance, that would be a Deed of Gift match, or DOG match (hence the trimaran's provocative nickname, which its crew and designers have yet to embrace).
 But BMW Oracle and its owner, the American software billionaire Larry Ellison, could decide to drop the lawsuit, which was begun last year in the belief that Alinghi had made an unseemly power grab when it picked a newly constituted Spanish yacht club as its official challenger and then published race rules widely viewed as one-sided.
 If the lawsuit is withdrawn, Alinghi has already announced that the next Cup -- scaled down for the new economic realities -- will be staged in traditional monohull yachts in Valencia, Spain, in 2010. 
 Even if Oracle does not succumb to mounting peer pressure and end the legal action, it could still lose in court, which would mean that the trimaran in San Diego Harbor, 90 feet by 90 feet with a 158-foot mast, would be reduced to a white elephant. Or would it?
 ''I think we'll try to set a few speed records with the boat if it doesn't get used,'' Ellison, the software impresario, said in a telephone interview. ''We'll find something to do with it. Priority 1 is to get the America's Cup back on track. 
 ''The reason this boat was built was for the Deed of Gift match, so if we win the America's Cup we can go back to a fair set of rules and a multichallenger event where the rules are the same for everybody,'' Ellison said. ''That's the primary purpose of this boat, and if we get there, however we get there, I'll be happy.''
 For the moment, happiness is an elusive emotion in Cup circles. Securing sponsorship, already a daunting challenge because of the uncertainty generated by the lawsuit, has become even harder with the global economic downturn. 
 Would-be challengers have scaled back plans and payrolls radically. Alinghi, owned by the Swiss billionaire Ernesto Bertarelli, has resorted to cutbacks and layoffs, including dropping one of its two sailing crews. 
 And Alinghi is still negotiating to extend its deal with one of its primary sponsors, the Swiss bank UBS, which has been hit particularly hard by the financial crisis.
 Even BMW Oracle, with its primary sponsors still on board and Ellison's billions for backup, is apparently sparing expenses. Its temporary base in San Diego was long on trimaran but short on creature comforts, with the team operating out of shipping containers in a converted fenced-in lot at which no fewer than 20 parking spaces were occupied last week by a reserve mast laid flat.
 Although modern America's Cup teams traditionally prize security and secrecy, curiosity-seekers in San Diego had no problem getting a close look at the trimaran. All they had to do was walk to the end of the terrace at Joe's Crab Shack, which is precisely what some of Alinghi's emissaries did earlier this year when they came to spy in plain view.
 What they saw should not have reassured them, according to Coutts. It is not the largest multihull racing sailboat in the world: Banque Populaire V, launched in France earlier this year, is about 130 feet long. 
 But Coutts said the BMW Oracle boat was ''the fastest,'' and while most big trimarans were built for offshore racing, this one was designed for inshore racing.
 ''It's much lighter, more powerful with a much bigger mast, sails and so forth and much more extreme,'' he said. ''This boat is a no-compromise lightweight flyer basically, so there's a huge difference.''
 Coutts, a New Zealander with a Dudley Do-Right jaw, is no multihull expert. He made his name as a supreme helmsman of monohulls. He has already won the America's Cup three times: twice with Team New Zealand and once with Alinghi in 2003 before parting acrimoniously with the Swiss-based syndicate and Bertarelli.
 After Coutts sat out last year's Cup, Ellison hired him to run his team after Oracle was eliminated early from the challenger series, the Louis Vuitton Cup. Coutts's new role has only complicated matters in the legal duel with Bertarelli and Alinghi.
 Rapprochement is not out of the question, but unlike Alinghi, which is still building its multihull, BMW Oracle's backup plan is already afloat and casting very long shadows across the Pacific.

 Museums
 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE SEDUCTION OF LIGHT,' through March 29. Comparisons may be invidious, but they can also be illuminating. Consider this small, tightly focused exhibition of portraits by the 19th-century American folk artist Ammi Phillips and paintings by the 20th-century Abstract Expressionist Mark Rothko. The presentation reveals parallel ways of dealing with surface, color and light. It also reveals two painters who were, each in his own pragmatic yet metaphysically resonant way, distinctly American artists. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
 ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'ART AND CHINA'S REVOLUTION,' through Jan. 11. The splashy party that was the 2008 Olympics is yesterday's news, but one-party rule in China remains. New China is still, in significant ways, Old China. The obvious question is: What comes next? To help answer it, Asia Society asks a different, equally timely post-Olympics question: What came before? This exhibition of paintings, drawings, posters and Maoist souvenirs produced in the years leading up to and during the Cultural Revolution gives complicated answers. It lays out the conflicted loyalties that have shaped contemporary China, and finds them in the work of artists who anticipated the current art boom and are part of it. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)
 * ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'TRACES OF THE CALLIGRAPHER: ISLAMIC CALLIGRAPHY IN PRACTICE, CIRCA 1600-1900,' AND 'WRITING THE WORD OF GOD: CALLIGRAPHY AND THE QUR'AN,' through Feb. 8. These side-by-side exhibitions, perfect in size and carefully thought out, approach Islamic calligraphy from two perspectives. The first show is basically a manual in techniques of fine penmanship and luxury book-making, illustrated by superb examples of tools of the trade and finished products. The second is an array of hand-written Koran pages for total-immersion contemplation. Gorgeous. (See above.) (Cotter)
 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'STREET ART STREET LIFE: FROM THE 1950S TO NOW,' through Jan. 25. If to you ''street life'' means noise-lights-action, you'll find this show a surprise. With its immaculate, stripped-down installation, the exhibition is clearly devoted not to recreating the feel of art on the street, but to recording it, from Robert Frank's unvarnished photographic views of post-World War II America to digital montages by Fatimah Tuggar uniting today's streets of New York and Lagos, Nigeria. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GILBERT & GEORGE,' through Jan. 11. Dynamic duo, gruesome twosome or just plain geeks in ties and tweeds, the British artists Gilbert & George don't seem to care what you call them as long as you pay attention, which you couldn't avoid doing if you tried in their suffocating and disordered wraparound survey at the Brooklyn Museum. In no particular sequence, we see the shadowy early black-and-white photographic pieces they did while living in a falling-down section of London in the 1970s, and the huge Pop colored murals filled with flowers and crowds of dishy young men, which decrease in number during the most devastating years of the AIDS epidemic. The newest work in the show, from 2005 and 2006, is crazy, end-of-time stuff. Terrorism and religious fundamentalism are the themes, and Gilbert and George themselves, partners in art as in life, are in the picture, mugging, moralizing, unembarrassed and all but unendurable, in art that's right for right now. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'JESPER JUST: ROMANTIC DELUSIONS,' through Jan. 4. An enchanting show of four short films exhibits most of the qualities for which Mr. Just has become known since completing his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 2003. Melodramatic but never campy or over the top and made with Hollywood-quality production values, his brief musicals explore vulnerable, ordinarily well-armored zones of the masculine psyche, like grief, same-sex love, Oedipal conflict and spiritual desire. The singing is wonderful. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HOUSE PROUD: 19TH-CENTURY WATERCOLOR INTERIORS FROM THE THAW COLLECTION,' through Jan. 25. The 70 or so jewel-like renderings of rooms and their furnishings here are delightful, mordantly signifying artifacts. They track the domestic effects of exoticism and nostalgia (chinoiserie, Gothic Revival); uncover glimmers of modernity (Biedermeier, smaller rooms); and witness the birth of the contemporary genre known as shelter porn. Accompanied by relevant examples of furniture, decorative objects and books, they also reveal that rooms seen whole, with light and space as well as decor carefully depicted, are among painting's most appealing subjects. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)
 * FRICK COLLECTION: 'ANDREA RICCIO: RENAISSANCE MASTER OF BRONZE,' through Jan. 18. Scholars say that Andrea Riccio was one of the greatest sculptors of the Italian Renaissance. Cast in dark bronze and resembling Roman antiquities, Riccio's small-scale statuettes, reliefs and oil lamps seem unremarkably modest at first. But let your eyes adjust to the formal subtlety, expressive urgency and almost supernatural aliveness of his art and you will fall in love. Sculpture does not get much better than this. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'THEANYSPACEWHATEVER,' through Jan. 7. The innately sculptural Guggenheim mounts the first major exhibition in this country about relational aesthetics -- probably the most radical art to emerge in the 1990s -- and comes up looking, well, remarkably empty, which is also extraordinarily beautiful in its own Wright. The more or less interactive works by 10 artists invite you to experience in a new way time, space, the art-viewing world and the museum itself. Even if you never want to see the museum going this far out again, the Guggenheim must be credited for bringing the latest art remarkably intact to a larger public. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CATHERINE OPIE: AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHER,' through Jan. 7. Catherine Opie is many artists in one. Best known in the 1990s for her striking portraits of gay, lesbian and transgendered men and women drawn from a circle of friends and intimates, she is also a photographer of landscapes, cityscapes, architecture, still lifes and lifestyles. She is an insider and an outsider: a documentarian and a provocateur, a classicist and a maverick; a trekker and a stay-at-home; a lesbian feminist mother who resists the gay mainstream. It's all here in a fine retrospective. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Cotter) 
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AMERICA AND THE TINTYPE,' through Jan. 4. This show about the tintype, an early form of photograph made by exposing a lacquered iron plate to light, includes some 200 examples from the museum's collection. Most of the artists, and subjects, are unidentified. These works form a group portrait of Americans, mostly working- and middle-class, struggling to adapt to the rapidly shifting social and economic conditions during the four decades after the Civil War. The exhibition makes the most of the tintype's range of subject matter and emotion, from postmortem shots to vaudevillian caricatures, freedmen to minstrels. It does not dispute the daguerreotype's superior potentials for artistry but simply asserts that tintypes have been unfairly overlooked because of their ubiquity, affordability and anonymity. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'SUSAN MEISELAS: IN HISTORY,' through Jan. 4. A certain moral quandary runs throughout this fascinatingly problematic exhibition: how do you reconcile the demands of professionalism and those of human compassion? To her credit, Ms. Meiselas -- whose coverage of the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua in 1978-79 made her one of the world's most celebrated and criticized war correspondents -- does not duck the question. Tension between opportunism and conscience emerges as the show's main interest -- to the point that it trumps its ostensible subjects, which include strippers in traveling carnivals and forensic investigations of Saddam Hussein's campaign against the Kurds in northern Iraq. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'CHAGALL AND THE ARTISTS OF THE RUSSIAN JEWISH THEATER, 1919-1949,' through March 22. A fascinating tale of two vanguard theater companies that flourished in Moscow for a few years after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 is told by this big, walk-in scrapbook of a show presenting more than 200 pieces of art and ephemera. Exploring the histories of the Hebrew-speaking Habima theater and the Yiddish-speaking Moscow State Yiddish Theater, the exhibition includes drawings, paintings, photographs, posters, sheet music, costumes and clips from vintage films. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'ART AND LOVE IN RENAISSANCE ITALY,' through Feb. 16. With the most cherished of all human emotions as its central theme, this exhibition examines 14th- and 15th-century marriage rituals in Italy in terms of the many sumptuous objects and artworks they generated. The show includes ceramics, paintings, a cradle, wedding portraits and childbirth trays. Its many images mix happy endings and cautionary tales (some of the most gruesome intended for bridal chambers). Profane love is acknowledged with a choice display of erotica. The commodification and adoration of women run on parallel tracks, right up to and including two majestic paintings by Titian. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
 THE MET: 'BEYOND BABYLON: ART, TRADE, AND DIPLOMACY IN THE SECOND MILLENNIUM B.C.,' through March 15. This big, prescient, concentration-taxing exhibition is the latest in the Met's line of investigative archaeological shows, and it is not geared to quick-take viewing. Many of the objects are small and intimate; made to be worn, handled and easily transported. A proliferation of wall texts gives the show the pace of a lavishly illustrated book. Patient viewing is rewarded by a fascinating story of a proto-global world in formation nearly 4,000 years ago. (See above.). (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'THE ESSENTIAL ART OF AFRICAN TEXTILES,' through March 22. This show presents 19th-century African textiles, many lent by the British Museum, alongside relevant contemporary artworks from the Met's collection. One of the most spectacular pairings matches El Anatsui's ''Between Earth and Heaven,'' a recent acquisition, with a kente prestige cloth from Ghana. The Met's 2005 exhibition ''Matisse: The Fabric of Dreams'' hinted that textiles had been undervalued in the Western canon; while the current show may not have the same blockbuster appeal, it goes deeper into the techniques and traditions that make the fabrics so striking and seductive. A related show, ''The Poetics of Cloth: African Textiles/Recent Art,'' is at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 THE MET: 'EARLY BUDDHIST MANUSCRIPT PAINTING: THE PALM-LEAF TRADITION,' through March 22. Practical features like resilience and portability help explain why books written on dried palm leaves were popular with Buddhists in eastern India between the 10th and 13th centuries. But another factor, surely, was the quality of the illustrations that accompanied the texts: exquisite figures of divinities or scenes from the Buddha's life. And few of these are as finely done and pristinely preserved as the examples in this small selection. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'GIORGIO MORANDI, 1890-1964,' through Dec. 14. Aspirants to the role of painter as poet are many. Giorgio Morandi (1890-1964) was the real thing. And this Morandi retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is something that anyone who loves painting and its very specific poetry will want to see. Morandi's still lifes are beautiful, but with a distinctive kind of beauty. And despite their small size and plain components -- bottles, jars, boxes, pots, seashells, vases -- they are emotionally audacious. This isn't because of what they say outright, but because of what they don't say; because they are so evidently shaped by self-restraint, and the passions that produced it. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'LANDSCAPES CLEAR AND RADIANT: THE ART OF WANG HUI (1632-1717),' through Jan. 4. The Met's first solo show devoted to a Chinese master is gorgeous and revelatory; its focus is the landscape virtuoso Wang Hui, star of the 17th-century Chinese art scene. Wang could do anything and did, synthesizing and transforming disparate strands of almost a millennium of Chinese painting, but also making exact copies of earlier masterpieces. Distinguished by a Mozart-like ease and perfection, his work unsettles Western notions of copy, original and originality. It is aided in this by displays of works by 16 earlier artists dating to the 10th-century -- his mentors, his mentors' mentors and the artists they all revered -- which form a dazzling introduction to Chinese painting in general. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'THE PHILIPPE DE MONTEBELLO YEARS: CURATORS CELEBRATE THREE DECADES OF ACQUISITIONS,' through Feb. 1. As the title implies, the show is a tribute to Mr. de Montebello, who is leaving the Met after being director for more than 30 years. For the occasion, curators in 17 of the museum departments have chosen objects in their fields of expertise from the permanent collection. There are marvelous things here, from Chinese scrolls, Greek vessels and Oceanic effigies to Byzantine icons and an 18th-century American pickle-holder. In short, a wonder-cabinet situation. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: 'DRAWING BABAR: EARLY DRAFTS AND WATERCOLORS,' through Jan. 4. The first and most brilliant Babar book (''The Story of Babar'') gets its own gallery in which Jean de Brunhoff's familiar story is illustrated by his sketches and drafts -- a room bound to fascinate children and the adults who read to them. Another is devoted to the first Babar book by Jean's son, Laurent (''Babar's Cousin''), who first heard about the elephant in the green suit in bedtime stories. In this compact, elegant exhibition, we don't learn a lot about the reasons for Babar's appeal. Speculation is restrained, and simple demonstration preferred, an approach in keeping with Jean's spare, precise narrative and laconic illustration, in which diverging lines of dots become tears; angled eyebrows signal anger; and the varied curves of an elephant's trunk evoke an inner life. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Edward Rothstein)MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: JOHN MILTON'S 'PARADISE LOST,' through Jan. 4. To honor Milton's quadricentennial, eight of the pages of the only known surviving manuscript of Book 1 of ''Paradise Lost'' are on view, along with other Miltoniana, including a first edition and a miniature portrait believed to be of the poet. The handwriting is a scribe's; Milton, who was blind, composed the work orally. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org.
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'SECOND LIVES: REMIXING THE ORDINARY,' through Feb. 15. The inaugural show in the Museum of Arts and Design's jewel-box-like building continues its haphazard segue from a concentration on craft to a hipper, more wide-ranging program. Unfortunately, the focus is a strategy that is epidemic in the larger art world: the massing of something small (plastic spoons, ladies pumps, spools of thread, dangling eyeglasses) into something large (a pyramid, a loveseat, a view of the ''Mona Lisa,'' a chandelier). It is Surrealism 101, descended from Meret Oppenheim's beloved and far too influential fur-lined teacup. Basically, you see the thing. You see the things it is made of. Something in the way of a punch line follows. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'PARIS/NEW YORK: DESIGN FASHION CULTURE, 1925-1940,' through Feb. 22. This compact yet kaleidoscopic exhibition celebrates the romance that flourished between New York and Paris in the 1920s and '30s, when French Art Deco was the style, American jazz was the music, and skyscrapers and sumptuous ocean liners were among the symbols of the age. Selected and installed to extract maximum wattage from every juxtaposition, object and image (including many surprisingly effective digital reproductions), it tracks the exchange of goods as much as of ideas, and the roles played by both department stores and museums, knock-offs and originals, businessmen (especially developers) and designers and artists. Most memorably, it clarifies a golden age of design and building, when New York became the world capital of Art Deco architecture. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY AFRICAN DIASPORAN ARTS: 'I AM A MAN,' through Jan. 18. The words that make up the title of this strong, timely group show were emblazoned on placards carried by striking black workers in Birmingham, Ala., in 1968. But the show turns the original assertion into a question: what does it mean to be an African-American male today? A smart Pop-style painting by Fahamu Pecou sends up stereotypes of sexual prowess; a video by Lorenzo Steele Jr. looks at prison life from the inside; Jefferson Pinder casts his sights back to the Civil Rights movement's espousal of passive resistance in a video piece that illustrates that ideal in action. The written statements by each artist are well worth reading. 80 Hanson Place, at South Portland Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 230-0492, mocada.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'JOAN MIRO: PAINTING AND ANTI-PAINTING 1927-1937,' through Jan. 12. When, in 1927, Joan Miro said, ''I want to assassinate painting,'' he wasn't saying anything new. What was new was the way he carried out his self-assigned, cut-throat task. And that process is the subject of this invigorating, absorbing and -- Miro would be mortified -- beautiful show. It illustrates, step by step, how he stalked and attacked painting -- zapped its conventions, messed up its history, spoiled its market value -- through distinctive groups of experimental works produced over a decade. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'LOOKING AT MUSIC,' through Jan. 5. This exhibition of about 40 works from the museum's collection emphasizes the experimental nature of both art and music in the late 1960s and early '70s. The lines dividing art, music and film were blurry enough to allow Laurie Anderson, Bruce Nauman and Yoko Ono, among others, to shift from object making to performance and back again. The show, which includes audio recordings and small-press publications alongside more conventional mediums, is accompanied by an extensive film and video program. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'NEW PHOTOGRAPHY 2008: JOSEPHINE MECKSEPER AND MIKHAEL SUBOTZKY,' through Jan. 5. Josephine Meckseper, a German-born artist in her 40s who was trained at the California Institute of the Arts, makes sleek-looking installations that mix photography and film -- often scenes of political protest -- with consumer objects. The South African artist Mikhael Subotzky, who at 26 is the youngest photographer to have been invited to join the Magnum Group, explores his country's prison system in vivid color and unflinching detail. If Ms. Meckseper finds glossy, consumerist fantasy infiltrating our political consciousness, Mr. Subotzky reminds us that some people don't yet have the luxury of fretting about the commodification of dissent. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'VAN GOGH AND THE COLORS OF THE NIGHT,' through Jan. 5. This small, anomalous exhibition is a Van Gogh antiblockbuster with a seemingly counterintuitive theme, given the importance of the brilliant light of southern France to his art. It explores Van Gogh's special relationship with darkness, where his interests in perception, color and symbolism fuse with unexpected intensity. And seeing a manageable number of Van Goghs -- including masterpieces like ''The Potato Eaters,'' ''The Starry Night'' and ''Night Cafe'' -- in intimate galleries is thrilling. (See above.) (Smith)
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'GEORGE TOOKER: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through Jan. 4. George Tooker has painted some of the 20th century's most memorable images of angst. With its lost souls haunting the New York underground, ''Subway'' (1950) envisions modernity as a spiritual prison system. The Kafkaesque ''Government Bureau'' (1956) pictures an office of seemingly infinite dimensions, where people wait like penitents at the windows of terminally unresponsive bureaucrats. Both paintings are included in this richly affecting five-decade career retrospective. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Johnson)
 NEUE GALERIE: 'ALFRED KUBIN: DRAWINGS, 1897-1909,' through Jan. 26. You would never guess that the Viennese artist Alfred Kubin was a contemporary of Gustav Klimt; he is closer in spirit to the Belgian James Ensor and the Norwegian Edvard Munch, visionaries who expressed modernity's spiritual toll and anticipated some of the horrors of the 20th century. Executed in black-and-white pen, ink and spray on heavy paper used for cartography, Kubin's drawings map the shadowy corners of the unconscious. Playing to the art's dark themes, the Neue Galerie's third floor has been made over in the sensationally macabre style of a Tim Burton movie. The walls are painted black and brown; red crushed-velvet curtains hang in the doorways; and Kubin's death mask is displayed in a coffinlike glass case. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'LIVE FOREVER: ELIZABETH PEYTON,' through Jan. 11. This lush midcareer survey pays tribute to an artist whose diminutive, irony-free, boldly colored portraits of friends, artists, rock stars and other historic figures, living and dead, have exerted considerable influence over the last 16 years. The reason is a complex, highly effective fusion of the painterly, the personal and the Conceptual, as well as a kind of reverse appropriation, wherein photographs and snapshots are given a new permanence, substance and most of all feeling by being re-engineered into unique art objects. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'MARY HEILMANN: TO BE SOMEONE,' through Jan. 26. Over the past four decades Ms. Heilmann has been painting with an infectious, unabashedly hedonistic joie de vivre. Working with big brushes and generous quantities of paint, she continues to produce wildly colorful abstractions that riff with irreverent verve on basic elements of Modernist painting: the grid, the monochromatic rectangle, stripes, organic forms, linear webs, spots, checks and drips. This exhilarating retrospective presents works dating from 1967 to the present. (See above.) (Johnson)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through April 13. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'ALEXANDER CALDER: THE PARIS YEARS, 1926-1933,' through Feb. 15. Is art glorified child's play, extending into adulthood, through a lifetime, picking up ideas and gaining finesse as it goes? That's one way to think of this exhibition, which focuses intently on one artist's child-within embodied in toys, cartoons and wire figures, with the Whitney's famous ''Calder's Circus'' as a centerpiece and a grown-up modernist surprise at the end. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'WILLIAM EGGLESTON: DEMOCRATIC CAMERA,' through Jan. 25. When William Eggleston's color, snapshot-like photographs of his home territory in the American South were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in 1976, critics squawked that the work was vulgar and haphazard. But these pictures quickly became influential classics. And that's how they look in this 40-year retrospective at the Whitney, the artist's first New York museum solo since his seditious debut. The show includes a recently edited version of Mr. Eggleston's cruel, unusual and ultimately revolting video epic ''Stranded in Canton.'' (See above.) (Cotter)

 'FRANKENTHALER AT EIGHTY: SIX DECADES'Helen Frankenthaler's longtime gallery is throwing her an 80th-birthday party. With nine large-scale works from the artist's personal collection, covering more than five decades, the show takes the form of a mini-retrospective. (A more substantial museum survey is long overdue.) The earliest work is ''Western Dream,'' a maelstrom of lavender-and-coral stains on unprimed canvas; the newest is ''Warming Trend,'' a near-monochrome field of indigo with fiery undertones. Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com, through Jan. 10. (Rosenberg)
 'ISABEL AND OTHER INTIMATE STRANGERS: PORTRAITS BY ALBERTO GIACOMETTI AND FRANCIS BACON' The artist-muse relationship inspires a museum-quality exhibition, inaugurating Gagosian's new fourth-floor exhibition space. The woman singled out in the title is the model Isabel Rawsthorne, whose chiseled cheekbones inspired several paintings by Bacon and sculptures by Giacometti. Other captivating figures in the exhibition include Lucian Freud, in Bacon's portraits, and Giacometti's wife and mistress (in separate, and markedly different, paintings). The show was organized by Veronique Wiesinger, the director of the Giacometti Foundation in Paris, and Martin Harrison, who is overseeing Bacon's catalogue raisonne. Gagosian, 980 Madison Avenue, near 77th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com, through Dec. 13. (Rosenberg)
 'NEIL JENNEY: NEW PAINTINGS' With the works in this beautiful show, his first exhibition of new paintings in New York since 1998, Neil Jenney continues to create idiosyncratic, magic realist landscapes with heavy black frames. Most surprising are two paintings of luminous blue skies with puffy, animal-shaped clouds in them and the word ''Atmosphere'' neatly lettered on each frame. Barbara Mathes Gallery, 22 East 80th Street, (212) 570-4190, bmathesgallery.com, through Jan. 24. (Johnson)
 LIZA LOU It's no coincidence that Liza Lou's first New York appearance since a 2002 solo in SoHo takes place in an uptown town house and a Park Avenue lobby. Ms. Lou, a sculptor who makes hand-beaded versions of everyday objects and environments, has shifted from immersive installations (like the ''Kitchen'' and ''Back Yard'' exhibited at the New Museum in the mid-'90s) to highly marketable sculptures and relief paintings. The transition isn't all bad. Ms. Lou's beadwork is still dazzling, and she is certainly experimenting with different genres. The showstopper is ''Security Fence'' (2005-7), a shimmering 10-foot-square enclosure of barbed wire and chain-link steel completely covered with silver beads. L & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com, through Dec. 13. (Rosenberg)
 Galleries: SoHo
 ROBERT CUMMING: 'RECOLETA' An exceptionally inventive painter, sculptor and photographer, Mr. Cumming has hand-cut a series of intricate, faux-Victorian silhouette pictures from sheets of black paper. Packed with eccentric storytelling and intriguing symbolism, they were inspired by a visit to La Recoleta, a vast cemetery in Buenos Aires. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at West Houston Street, (212) 431-0166, janetbordeninc.com, through Dec. 13. (Johnson)
 TESSA FARMER This imaginative British sculptor has created a hideous race of ant-size ''fairies'': teeny, black humanoid skeletons equipped with insect wings. She has documented their activities, which include hunting, killing and eating bugs much bigger than themselves, in riveting stop-action videos. You also will find them populating sculptures revolving around a mummified dog, a stuffed crow and a dead mouse. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455, spencerbrownstonegallery.com, through Dec. 13. (Johnson)
 CHARLOTTE POSENENSKE: 'PROTOTYPES FOR MASS PRODUCTION (1965-1967)' The works in this exhibition -- simple geometric forms made of folded sheet metal and painted in black and primary-colored enamels -- were intended to be mass-produced, sold at cost and displayed in public. Ms. Posenenske quit making art in 1968 when she concluded that it could not make enough of a political difference in the world, but her sculptures still have a bright, Pop Art-like punch. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com, through Jan. 10. (Johnson)
 KEHINDE WILEY: 'DOWN' Mr. Wiley is known for paintings of young African-American men dressed in fashionable street wear posing against richly patterned backgrounds like heroic figures in Renaissance paintings. This exhibition presents eight enormous paintings of young men in reclining positions. The biggest, called ''Sleep,'' which measures 11 by 25 feet, depicts a muscular man lying back like the dead Jesus, naked but for a snowy white cloth swaddling his hips. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com, through Dec. 20. (Johnson)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 STAN DOUGLAS: 'HUMOR, IRONY AND THE LAW' This show's main attraction, an almost entirely silent film called ''Video,'' combines ponderous academicism and cinematic intrigue. It follows a young woman caught in a Kafkaesque nightmare in which she is harassed by men in trench coats, put on trial, abducted and forced into a final, desperate act. David Zwirner, 533 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, davidzwirner.com, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)
 CHARLES GAINES: 'MANIFESTOS' The politically charged texts scrolling up flat-screen monitors in this poetically resonant and conceptually intriguing exhibition are manifestos from movements like the Black Panthers and the Zapatistas. The minor-key music that accompanies them -- composed using a John Cage-like system of chance and played by a piano quintet -- is beautiful and soothing. Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 627-3680, kentgallery.com, through Dec. 20. (Johnson)
 ZAHA HADID It is hard to think of a living architect who also makes interesting fine art. Ms. Hadid, the world-famous, London-based designer, is no exception. The big, shiny, molded fiberglass works in this two-part exhibition resemble flimsy pieces of decor and furniture for one of her aerodynamic, retro-futuristic buildings. Sonnabend, 536 West 22nd Street, and 169 10th Avenue, at 21st Street, (212) 627-1018, rovetv.net, through Dec. 13. (Johnson)
 AL HELD An awesome blast of light, color, space and geometry awaits visitors to this exhibition of six paintings dating from 1979 to 1985 by Mr. Held (1928-2005). Rendered in richly saturated and incandescent colors, these expansive, hard-edged pictures of grids, boxes, wheels and serpentine loops interpenetrating and receding into infinite, Euclidean distances are like visions of a Neo-Platonist on acid. Paul Kasmin Gallery, 293 10th Avenue, at 27th Street, (212) 563-4474, paulkasmingallery.com, through Jan. 10. (Johnson)
 CINDY SHERMAN After years of vamping behind caricatures or actual masks, Ms. Sherman gets closer to her own skin and to actual photography than she has since the beginning of her career. The convention under scrutiny is the social portrait: women of some sort of stature. Aging, delusion and pretension are touched on, but they are usually superseded by an aura of determination, discipline and pride -- in other words, parts of the engine that has driven Ms. Sherman's own relentless career. Metro Pictures, 519 West 24th Street, (212) 206-7100, metropicturesgallery.com, through Dec. 23. (Smith)
 KELLEY WALKER One of the most interesting painters of the moment makes handsomely self-referential expanses of red and white brick walls using a combination of silkscreen, labor-intensive digitalization and collage. The postmodern romance with mechanical reproduction is maintained yet betrayed. The bricks represent with imposing solidity the bare-bones element needed to display paintings (walls). Yet up close these works are surprisingly delicate; the mortar, represented by cut-out newspapers of different kinds, is laid on top. There are more paintings than needed to make the point. Perhaps Mr. Walker's vacuous installation with mirrors and a disco ball is the counterargument: resistance to business as usual. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com, through Dec. 13. (Smith)
 Galleries: Other
 ERNST CARAMELLE: 'DOUBLE VISION' Mr. Caramelle partly covers sheets of ordinary colored construction paper with straight-edged pieces of paper, bleaches them in the sun and then removes the masking elements. The resulting geometric compositions have a beguiling luminosity. Tracy Williams Ltd., 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212) 229-2757, tracywilliamsltd.com, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)
 'LOOKING BACK' This annual assessment of the previous year in New York art includes a scary sound installation by Paul McCarthy; a pair of funky wooden sculptures of pianos by the playwright Richard Foreman; a sculpture of a white cube with eccentric additions, by Liz Craft; and a satiric videotaped conversation from 1977 between the critic Gregory Battcock and Marcia Tucker, the founding director of the New Museum. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street (entrance on Horatio Street), West Village, (212) 924-4212, whitecolumns.org, through Dec. 13. (Johnson)
 NASREEN MOHAMEDI: 'THE GRID, UNPLUGGED' This show of large, abstract drawings is the third New York solo of work by the Indian artist Nasreen Mohamedi (1937-1990), and the most beautiful yet, which means it's as about as beautiful as gallery shows get. Born to a Muslim family, Mohamedi studied art in London and Paris and was fully conversant with contemporary art in the West. Her major influences, though, were Islamic architecture, the modern urban landscape and fellow South Asian artists working in abstract, linear styles. This deeply moving show also includes digital excerpts from her poetic notebooks. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096, talwargallery.com, through Dec. 20. (Cotter)
 'ZERO IN NEW YORK' This gorgeous museumlike exhibition displays works by members of the Zero Group, a loose association of '60s-era European avant-gardists. It features works dating from 1957 to 1966 by about 20 artists, including Piero Manzoni, Arman, Yves Klein and Jean Tinguely. Founded in the late 1950s by two Germans, Heinz Mack and Otto Piene, the Zero Group rejected personal expressionism in favor of radically new forms of abstraction. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, speronewestwater.com, through Dec. 20. (Johnson)
 Out of Town
 MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS, BOSTON: 'RACHEL WHITEREAD: PLACE (VILLAGE),' through Jan. 25. This exhibition, the centerpiece of the museum's mini-survey devoted to the British sculptor Rachel Whiteread, may strike the artist's admirers as a bizarre and kitschy departure. Viewers who have never seen one of her room-size casts won't really get a sense of her work from this installation, which is making its United States debut. Still, the show, which includes drawings and a few smaller sculptures, reveals the more emotive side of an artist who can come off as somber and humorless. 465 Huntington Avenue, (617) 267-9300, mfa.org. (Rosenberg)
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'JAN LIEVENS: A DUTCH MASTER REDISCOVERED,' through Jan. 11. Although not a household name now, Jan Lievens once was famous throughout Northern Europe for his portraits and his religious and history paintings. A child prodigy, he was a friend and colleague of Rembrandt's. Early in their careers, the two painters worked closely together, and many of Lievens's paintings later were misattributed to Rembrandt. Lievens was not Rembrandt's equal, but he had his moments, especially in remarkably precocious paintings that he made as a teenager. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'POMPEII AND THE ROMAN VILLA: ART AND CULTURE AROUND THE BAY OF NAPLES,' through March 22. This show about the opulent lifestyle of the Roman elite before the A.D. 79 eruption of Vesuvius includes recent discoveries on view in the United States for the first time, as well as finds from excavations dating to the mid-18th century. The galleries unfold according to the floor plan of a typical villa, and the installation -- which includes decorative columns, wall borders, living plants and reproductions of mosaics -- works hard to maintain the illusion of classical architecture. The exhibition moves from artifacts reflecting ancient Romans' infatuation with Greek culture to the rediscovery of Pompeii by 18th-century Europeans, suggesting that every culture finds affirmation of its taste and sophistication in a previous golden age. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Rosenberg)
 YALE CENTER FOR BRITISH ART: 'SUN, WIND AND RAIN: THE ART OF DAVID COX,' through Jan. 4. Watercolor was all the rage in early-19th-century England, and one of its most admired practitioners is the subject of this expansive, engaging show. Cox had a particular knack for picturing windy days, and the liveliness of his scenes is reflected in his vigorously realist style. Many of his most affecting pictures show ordinary travelers making their ways toward distant, unseen goals within the picture. Life is a journey. 1080 Chapel Street, New Haven, (877) 274-8278, yale.edu/ycba. (Johnson)
 Last Chance
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'R. CRUMB'S UNDERGROUND' The former underground comic artist R. Crumb has created some of the most memorable characters in cartoon history, including the irascible guru Mr. Natural; the suave, shamelessly randy Fritz the Cat; the angry Amazon Devil Girl; and R. Crumb himself, a figure comparable to the autobiographical alter egos of Woody Allen and Philip Roth. He has been a fearlessly irreverent satirist and an intrepid explorer of his own twisted psyche. And he is excruciatingly funny. This enthralling show presents more than 100 works from all phases of his five-decade career. 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org; closes on Sunday. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'RHYTHMS OF MODERN LIFE: BRITISH PRINTS 1914-1939' This interesting but confusingly organized exhibition considers the impact of modernity and machine-age idealism on 13 progressive British printmakers. Much of the show is given over to a group of artists active in the 1920s and '30s -- including Claude Flight, Cyril E. Power and Sybil Andrews -- who created colorful linocuts in a lively synthesis of Cubism, Futurism and Art Deco. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. (Johnson)
 'PERVERTED BY THEATER' This wildly pluralistic group exhibition rebuts the famous 1967 essay ''Art and Objecthood,'' in which the critic Michael Fried condemned what he saw as a corrupting theatricality in new art. In their brochure essay, the curators Franklin Evans and Paul David Young point out theatrical effects in works by Jim Nutt, Mel Bochner, Laylah Ali, Virgil Marti and others. Apex Art, 291 Church Street, near White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, apexart.org; closes on Saturday. (Johnson)
 'THE POETICS OF CLOTH' Emphasizing the place of traditional textiles in works by contemporary African artists, this exhibition includes internationally renowned figures like the Nigerian-born Yinka Shonibare and the Ghanaian El Anatsui. One of the show's discoveries, Grace Ndiritu, uses printed fabrics in an evocative four-screen video installation -- allowing her bare limbs to peek out from behind curtains or posing as a mummified Olympia. A related show, ''The Essential Art of African Textiles: Design Without End,'' is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart; closes on Saturday. (Rosenberg)

HEADLINE: AT&T to Cut 12,000 Jobs As Landline Losses Grow

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
AT&T announced Thursday that it plans to lay off 12,000 people and curb spending on new equipment -- a sign that the telecommunications industry is beginning to feel the pain of the economic downturn. 
 AT&T had already been struggling with a decline in revenue from its traditional wireline phone service as customers continued to drop landlines. Rapid growth in wireless, television and high-speed Internet services more than offset that drop.
 But analysts said Thursday that the recession is now clearly having an impact even on the fast-growing businesses.
 ''It's clear that the economy, the macro environment, is affecting their business, particularly on the wireline side,'' said John Hodulik, a telecommunications analyst at UBS Investment Research. ''The company had more line losses than expected, slower broadband growth than they expected and less activity in the business market.''
 AT&T, which had 303,500 employees at the end of the third quarter, said layoffs would begin in December and continue through 2009. Cutbacks will come primarily in its wireline units. 
 ''There's a continued industry shift from wireline to wireless and broadband,'' said Walt Sharp, an AT&T spokesman. 
 AT&T said it would take a charge of about $600 million in the fourth quarter related to severance costs.
 In addition, the company said it would cut capital expenditures in 2009. Although AT&T did not specify an amount, Mr. Hodulik predicted that spending would fall 10 to 15 percent from about $20 billion in 2008.
 AT&T said it would provide more details about the cuts and its outlook when it reports fourth-quarter earnings in January.
 In Thursday trading, AT&T shares fell 91 cents to close at $28.17.
 Margaret Schoener, research director of communications at Gartner, a research firm, said AT&T is capturing market share from rivals. 
 A particular bright spot has been the AppleiPhone, which brought the company 2.4 million activations in its third quarter. AT&T has exclusive rights to the iPhone in the United States.
 AT&T also expects to surpass a million subscribers to U-Verse, its high-speed Internet and video platform, by the end of the year.
 ''To keep making investments, they have to be smart about spending,'' said Ms. Schoener. Unfortunately for AT&T's employees, ''that translates to jobs.''

HEADLINE: Preening for the Olympics, Vancouver Is Building Up

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
EVEN when it rains hard in Vancouver, British Columbia, the host city for the next Olympic Games, big yellow backhoes at construction sites near Coal Harbour bite into the gray-brown mud and spill the muck into the backs of dump trucks. When one full truck lurches away, another pulls in by the time the backhoe takes its next chunk.
 With the 2010 Winter Games a bit more than a year away, many buildings are rising in and around Vancouver, each crowned by a slender crane that hoists construction materials to the top. Some of these new buildings will be condominiums, and a significant number of them will be owned by those who plan to use them as second homes.
 Those involved in local real estate estimate that about 20 percent of those second-home buyers will be Americans. ''We're really livable, which is why America likes us,'' said Bob Rennie, whose company, Rennie Marketing Systems, promotes several developments in Vancouver. 
 There has been a lot of construction going on in Vancouver in preparation for the Games -- and beyond. After the Winter Games, the 16-building Olympic Village, which will house about 2,800 athletes, is to be converted into a 730-unit luxury condominium complex called Millennium Water. About half the units have already been sold, Mr. Rennie said.
 A two-bedroom, 1,113-square-foot condo on the fourth floor of a Millennium Water building on Ontario Street was listed last month for 855,900 Canadian dollars ($673,937 at 1.27 Canadian dollars to the U.S. dollar). Three one-bedroom units between 584 and 686 square feet in a building on West First Avenue were listed at 464,900 to 505,900 Canadian dollars. It is possible to put 10 percent down.
 Although it is only 35 miles north of the border, Vancouver looks and feels different from any city in the United States or, for that matter, Canada. With its glass-and-steel towers crowding a sweeping harbor, it could be in Asia.
 It rains a lot, 44 inches a year, but it rarely snows, which means the Olympic events to be held in the city and nearby suburbs -- like hockey, figure skating and curling -- will take place on frozen indoor rinks. (The skiing events will be held in the mountains, 77 miles to the north, in Whistler.)
 With nearly 16 hours of daylight in summer, Vancouver is an ideal place to play golf at one of the city's 12 courses, or to go boating in the bays and inlets. Three mountains loom over Vancouver, close enough for skiing after school or work. Local residents say it is possible to golf, sail and ski in the same day.
 ''It's very easy to go places -- just a little drive to go up to the Rocky Mountains, and a little south to go to Vancouver Island,'' said Paulina Chan, a resident of Rumson, N.J., who bought a one-bedroom apartment in the 40-story Capitol Residences under construction in downtown Vancouver after selling her one-bedroom apartment in the Yaletown section last year. According to capitolresidences.com, all 372 suites have sold, for prices ranging from 320,000 Canadian dollars for a one-bedroom place to more than 640,000 dollars for a two-bedroom with a den.
 ''And people are very friendly, and they're a little bit calmer than New York City,'' she added, laughing. ''The speed is different. There's a different tempo in life, a very high quality of life. When you're considering a second home, you consider the quality of life along with money and convenience.''
 Some longtime residents in this city of about 600,000 still chuckle when they remember how Jim McKay, the sportscaster, referred to Vancouver as a ''village'' when the city's soccer team, the Whitecaps, was on its way to winning the North American Soccer League championship in 1979. The city has come a long way.
 Namely, Vancouver has become more sophisticated. Ms. Chan, an engineer whose company helps develop environmentally friendly technology projects, also owns homes in Hong Kong, Belgium and Budapest. She travels to Vancouver four or five times a year on business, but she likes to visit its galleries and restaurants when she is in town.
 She said she paid about 500,000 Canadian dollars for her new apartment, which she may or may not rent out when she is not in town; she added that she intended to rent her place out for the Olympics if she wasn't around. She considered her purchase to be a good one, because the apartment will be centrally located in a vibrant, sophisticated city. ''That location would be Madison Avenue in Manhattan,'' she said.
 Despite the Olympics-generated optimism, Vancouver has not been immune to the current real estate slump. According to a report released last month by the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver, the number of residential property sales declined by 55 percent from October 2007 to October 2008, from 3,028 to 1,364. And typical residential prices fell by 8.8 percent between May and October, to 518,668 Canadian dollars for single residences and to 358,359 dollars for apartment properties.
 According to reports, the Fortress Investment Group, the hedge fund and private equity firm that is the primary source of financing for the $1 billion Olympic Village near downtown, received an advance of 100 million Canadian dollars from the Vancouver City Council to cover cost overruns. 
 Real estate agents remain optimistic, though, that the market in general will snap back, perhaps in time for the Olympics. Dave Watt, a veteran residential agent and president of the real estate board, said prices ''ramped up too much, I think.''
 Mr. Watt, who grew up in the area, added: ''When I was a kid, people's second homes here were cabins. Now, they're far from being cabins.''
 As Mr. Watt and others tell it, Vancouver became a much more international city after the World Exposition was held there in 1986. Asians began buying and developing property in the late 1990s. The city attracted Americans, too, many to a growing film industry.
 Ten years ago, Steven and Dona Kirby, full-time residents of Reno, Nev., paid 1.35 million Canadian dollars for a three-bedroom, 2,400-square-foot condo next to Coal Harbour. Although the city has become more popular, they have kept their place, usually spending six weeks at a time in it. They also own a place in Fiji.
 ''It was inevitable,'' Mr. Kirby, now a retired lawyer, said of the city's growth, ''but it has not changed the way we feel about Vancouver one bit. There's been an influx of people, but it hasn't affected our lifestyle at all.''
 By design, there are no freeways through the city. Those who want to head miles north to Whistler must negotiate city streets before Provincial Route 99 whisks them through stunning, snow-capped mountains. Left intact, some of Vancouver's strollable neighborhoods have thrived.
 Robson Street is funky and eclectic, and South Granville Street, on the south side of False Creek, is lined with boutiques and galleries. Yaletown, at the southern end of the peninsula that forms the downtown, is sort of like the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan, with cafes and housewares stores. The Kirbys bought an Audi four years ago, but it has fewer than 10,000 miles on it.
 Much of the peninsula is surrounded by a sea wall, which is ideal for walking, biking and jogging. The sea wall surrounds Stanley Park, at the tip of the peninsula, which has a rose garden, a yacht club, a small thicket of genuine totem poles, an aquarium and reedy Beaver Lake, where wildfowl converge and tiny frogs hop to and fro.
 ''You don't have to get on a highway for an hour or two to get to things, as you do in Los Angeles,'' said Evelyn Froese, an agent for Royal LePage Westside who specializes in waterfront condominiums in Vancouver.
 Ms. Froese recentlygave a tour of a three-bedroom, 3,500-square-foot 16th-floor waterfront condominium owned by an American in 2 Harbour Green. The harbor (with floatplanes parked at piers), ship dock, convention center, Stanley Park and Vancouver Yacht Club were visible in a sweeping view.
 Ms. Froese said three-bedroom units to the 31-story building, which opened in September, were sold three years ago for 4 million Canadian dollars and up. Nearly all these waterfront condominiums are sold before they open, she and Mr. Watt said, with buyers making a 20 percent down payment.
 Partly as a result of Vancouver's appeal to Americans, real estate values nearly doubled between 2001 and 2006, Mr. Watt said, with typical single residences rising to a price of nearly 650,000 Canadian dollars and apartments and condos rising to about 400,000 dollars. Those prices began to slide only recently, influenced by the downturn in the American economy. ''You guys sneeze,'' Mr. Rennie said, ''and we get a little bit of a cold.''
 The Canadian dollar, which was worth more than the American dollar as recently as September, has dipped to a little over 80 cents. When the American dollar buys more in Canada, the number of visitors from the United States increases, and agents like Ms. Froese and Mr. Watt often field more calls from Americans asking about second homes. 
 The Olympics are expected to add more curiosity. In February 2010, the rest of the world will see, via Olympic telecasts over 16 days, the assets of Vancouver and expanses of British Columbia. ''There's no question that having Vancouver on that international stage can be nothing but fuel for the real estate market here,'' said Mark Lester, a senior vice president at Colliers International, real estate consultants.
 ''Personally, I think we'll see even more interest after the Olympics,'' said Beverly Kniffen, president of Cascadia Pacific Realty.
 Ms. Kniffen said about 40 percent of Cascadia Pacific Realty's clients were Americans. Most are interested in buying bigger houses in and around Vancouver to use as second or even third homes. The market has thrived to the point where more affordable housing has been replaced with high-ticket units, many used only part-time.
 ''It certainly has been a cause of concern,'' said Brent Toderian, the director of planning for the City of Vancouver. ''Some Vancouverites have expressed concern with having to compete with infrequent users -- or second-home buyers -- in a very expensive marketplace. It's often been a source of tension and debate within the city.''
 No one knows for sure what Vancouver will be like after the Games, though everyone agrees the city, and Whistler, will become more popular. The attractive waterfront, Vancouver's biggest selling point, will have been virtually developed. As Mr. Rennie said, ''Vancouver better hang on tight, because this is as calm as Vancouver will be.''

HEADLINE: 4 Fire Companies to Go Off Duty at Night

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
The Fire Department is reducing night duty at four city firehouses next month as a cost-cutting measure, and closing down the firehouse on Governors Island, the fire commissioner said on Thursday.
 The commissioner, Nicholas Scoppetta, said the reductions would be made in every borough except Queens. They are expected to save about $8.9 million and are part of the department's efforts to meet budget cuts demanded by the mayor.
 Commissioner Scoppetta said that each of the affected firehouses has two units -- a ladder company and an engine company -- and that one of the units at each house will be off duty from 6 p.m. to 9 a.m. beginning Jan. 17. The engine companies primarily carry water, hoses and pumps, and the ladder companies are usually used for rescues. 
 Night duty will end for Engine Company 4 at 42 South Street in Manhattan, Engine 161 at 278 McClean Avenue on Staten Island and Engine 271 at 392 Himrod Street in Brooklyn. The ladder companies at those firehouses will remain on duty at all times. 
 At the firehouse at 169 Schofield Street in the City Island section of the Bronx, Ladder Company 53 will be taken off night duty, but Engine 70 will remain, also providing emergency medical services, Mr. Scoppetta said. 
 The department is closing the firehouse on Governors Island because there are no permanent residents on the island and virtually no structural fires. Engines will be maintained there for special events.
 ''The overall impact on each community was a primary concern,'' said Mr. Scoppetta. 
 Department officials will meet with members of the City Council and community boards to hear their concerns, he said.
 But the announcement, made at Fire Department headquarters in Brooklyn, drew immediate objections from some quarters. Adolfo Carrion Jr., the Bronx borough president, said in a statement that closing Ladder 53 at night was an ''outrageous'' plan for City Island, which is connected to the mainland by a single bridge. The area has more than 5,000 residents, 2,300 homes and countless businesses, including restaurants that do the bulk of their business at night, he said. 
 ''To leave an island community, with only one point of access, without adequate fire protection is a recipe for disaster,'' he said.
 The last time the department reduced service was in 2003, when it shut down six engine companies.
 The Manhattan borough president, Scott M. Stringer, also said he was concerned about the potential effect on safety.
 ''Although the city is facing real fiscal difficulties, before I can accept closing F.D.N.Y. facilities I need to see an explanation for why these savings cannot be found elsewhere,'' he said in a statement. 
 Stephen J. Cassidy, president of the firefighters' union, the Uniformed Firefighters Association, said on Thursday that the planned nighttime closings were coming at a time when the department was responding to the most emergency calls in its history.
 ''In this post-9/11 world, the F.D.N.Y.'s expanded responsibilities to protect New Yorkers cannot be accomplished by service reductions,'' he said in a statement. ''More fatalities happen at night than any other time of day. Closing companies compromises public safety and threatens civilian and firefighter lives.''
 Francis X. Gribbon, the Fire Department's chief spokesman, confirmed that about two-thirds of civilian fatalities took place at night. But, he pointed out, the night shift is longer than the day shift -- 15 hours, compared with 9 -- which accounts, in part, for the larger number of deaths during that shift. 
 There have been 81 fire-related fatalities in the city this year, a number that has been declining. Ninety-five people died in 2007. ''Four of the last six years, there have been fewer than 100 deaths per year in the city,'' Mr. Gribbon said. 
 Mr. Scoppetta said response times had ''dramatically'' improved this year with a new dispatch protocol: Dispatchers send trucks out quickly and update them with further details while they are en route, rather than spending more time on the phone with a caller before sending firefighters out.
 The average citywide response time to a structural fire is 4 minutes 13 seconds, the lowest in six years, Mr. Gribbon said. 
 The commissioner said that the department, in making its reductions, had studied the areas covered by each firehouse, examining response times, the types of incidents reported and the distances between firehouses. 
 On City Island, for example, where the ladder company will go off duty at night, low residential buildings mean that portable ladders can be used.
 ''If there are any difficulties at all, we can respond with a truck,'' he said.
 The department also considered the proximity of trucks that could be called in a pinch. The firehouse at 42 South Street, for instance, is bordered by the East River and commercial buildings. If firefighters needed help in the area, he said, they could call on trucks near the residential areas in Battery Park City.

HEADLINE: East River Tolls Panned, but Payroll Tax Gets Support

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN and JEREMY W. PETERS; Charles V. Bagli contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A central element of a financial rescue plan for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority -- charging tolls on East River and Harlem River bridges -- met with sharp opposition from elected officials across the city after the plan was officially released on Thursday. 
 State legislators, mainly from Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx, said the plan by a state commission headed by Richard Ravitch, a former authority chairman, would unfairly burden drivers from their districts. 
 But many of those same legislators, along with some business leaders, were more supportive of another part of the plan: a proposed tax of one-third of 1 percent on payrolls in the 12-county region served by the authority, which includes New York City, Long Island and five counties north of the city.
 ''It'd be an extreme hardship to have to pay a toll every time,'' said Assemblywoman Helene E. Weinstein, a Democrat from Brooklyn. ''We're talking about people going to work, people going to doctor's appointments, elderly people.'' 
 The Ravitch plan is meant to head off a proposed 23 percent increase in revenue from fares and tolls and deep cuts in subway, bus and commuter rail service next year that the authority says it needs to help close a $1.2 billion budget gap. The plan calls for fewer service cuts, if any, and a fare and toll revenue jump of 8 percent.
 ''These are tough times,'' said Gov. David A. Paterson, who appointed the commission and appeared with Mr. Ravitch to unveil the plan. ''Difficult choices are going to have to be made, by legislators, by executives, and even by the riders and the drivers in the greater metropolitan area, with respect to the M.T.A.'' 
 Mr. Ravitch insisted that both the tax and tolls were essential for the plan's success, but a detailed look at the proposal suggested that the tax alone might be enough to see the authority through its short- and long-term financial difficulties. 
 By itself, the payroll tax, which is projected to generate $1.5 billion a year, would plug the authority's budget gap next year and provide hundreds of millions of dollars more to help the state and city close their own budget shortfalls. 
 In the years beyond that, the tax would provide enough revenue to finance the authority's capital program, which could cost up to $30 billion from 2010 to 2014, paying for essential maintenance and modernization of the transit system as well as expansion projects. The proposal refers to it as a regional mobility tax.
 The commission's plan calls for the revenue from the new bridge tolls -- about $600 million a year -- to be earmarked for an aggressive expansion of bus service in the city and surrounding counties. It became immediately clear that the two main prongs of the plan would each face very different receptions in the State Legislature, whose approval is required before the plan could be put into effect. 
 ''Any solution that disproportionately burdens middle- and working-class people who live in the Bronx, Queens and Brooklyn is not a fair way to deal with this, and that's what tolling the bridges would do,'' said Assemblyman Michael N. Gianaris, a Democrat from Queens. Mr. Paterson said that his staff would draft legislation to carry out the commission's proposals. But he acknowledged that there might be changes made during negotiations with the Legislature. 
 ''Obviously, this is open to negotiation,'' Mr. Paterson said at a news conference at his Midtown offices with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Mr. Ravitch. 
 Mayor Bloomberg, whose support will also be essential, was more guarded in his response, stopping short of a clear endorsement of the rescue plan. 
 Without using the words ''congestion pricing,'' he referred to his failed attempt earlier this year to persuade the State Legislature to pass his plan to charge drivers to enter the streets of Manhattan below 60th Street. The mayor's proposal also would have charged many drivers using the East River crossings and provided funds for the authority's long-term needs. 
 Referring to the Legislature, Mr. Bloomberg said, ''It really is up to them to come up with solutions.'' 
 Although the Democrats who control the Assembly blocked the congestion pricing plan this year, Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, expressed broad support for the commission report. 
 ''The straphangers should not be called upon to bear the total burden of the M.T.A.,'' Mr. Silver said. ''There are more stakeholders than just the people who ride the train every day.''
 Mr. Silver has spoken favorably in recent weeks about creating a tax to support the authority but has been largely silent on the issue of new bridge tolls. He promised to move quickly on the rescue plan. 
 Several business leaders expressed general support for the commission's plan. 
 Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, a prominent business group, said that the Ravitch plan was ''fair and balanced'' and that ''it really does merit the support of the business community.''
 Steven Spinola, the president of the Real Estate Board of New York, was more measured, saying that his organization supported tolls but worried about other tax increases beyond the proposed payroll tax. 
 ''If it's kept small, and other taxes are held, we'll probably support it,'' Mr. Spinola said.
 Mr. Ravitch and other state officials said they hoped that the Legislature would pass an authority rescue plan in January, before the Legislature gets too deep in talks over how to solve the state's own growing budget gap. 
 Marc V. Shaw, a senior adviser to the governor, said, ''The idea is to do it in front of the budget.'' 
 The authority must pass its 2009 budget this month, and officials said they expected it to include the larger fare increase and the service cuts, with the expectation that the authority would revise the budget once a rescue plan is approved.
 Mr. Ravitch insisted that all the elements of the plan should be enacted together. 
 ''This is not a series of separable recommendations,'' he said. ''This is an effort to spread the burden amongst the largest group that one possibly can.''
 The payroll tax would apply to all wages paid to employees at companies in the region, as well as at government agencies and nonprofit organizations like hospitals. Self-employed people would also have to pay. 
 It would be administered by a newly created capital finance arm within the authority, which would use the revenue after the first year to pay debt service on bonds for the next five-year capital program. The money would be kept in a separate account dedicated to capital programs. 
 Because the authority has other budgetary actions contemplated to cover about half of the $1.2 billion deficit it expects next year, some payroll tax revenue would be left over to relieve the state and city of some of their financial obligations to the authority in 2009.
 The bridge tolls would help buy new buses and build new depots and pay for the creation of bus corridors in which buses could operate more quickly, separated partly or completely from other traffic. Such a corridor has been opened in the Bronx.
 Under the plan, tolls on the East River bridges would match the tolls at other major crossings controlled by the authority, like the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge (formerly the Triborough Bridge), where drivers with E-ZPass currently pay $4.15 in each direction. Tolls on the Harlem River bridges would be set to match the base subway fare, which is now $2.
 The plan calls for the expanded bus service to be inplace before the tolls would begin. 
 For years, mayors have sought to get tolls approved on the East River bridges, and sometimes the Harlem River bridges as well, only to run into stiff opposition from residents and politicians in Queens and Brooklyn. 
 Mr. Ravitch said that transferring control of the bridges to the authority was a complex legal matter, and it was not clear how it would be accomplished. 
 But a city official said that city lawyers had investigated the issue extensively and were convinced that the Legislature would have to pass a bill allowing the transfer and authorizing the authority to collect tolls on the bridges. 
 The official spoke on condition of anonymity because the city has promised to help the governor's office in sorting through the legal issues. 
 The payroll tax would go into effect in the five New York boroughs, as well as Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Orange, Putnam and Dutchess Counties.
 A Plan to Close the M.T.A. Budget Gap: A state commission led by Richard Ravitch presented its recommendations for the region's financially troubled mass transit system on Thursday. Here are the main elements.: A payroll tax on companies operating in the authority's 12-county service area. The tax -- 33 cents on every $100 of payroll -- would provide $1.5 billion a year. The money would plug budget gaps next year and would help finance long-term capital spending on maintenance and system improvements. * Tolls on East River and Harlem River bridges that are currently free. The tolls would produce $600 million in revenue a year after expenses. The money would be dedicated to creating an expanded regional bus system and beefed-up city bus service. * Hold next year's fare and toll increase to an 8 percent rise in revenue and eliminate all or most of a series of proposed service cuts. The smaller fare and toll increase would replace a 23 percent increase in revenue proposed by the authority. * Regular fare and toll increases every two years, pegged to the inflation rate. The authority would be allowed to make these periodic increases without having to hold public hearings. Larger or more frequent increases would require hearings. * Change the management structure of the authority so that the chairman can also act as chief executive. Board members would also be required to have experience in relevant fields, such as transportation, finance or labor relations.

HEADLINE: Sabathia Is Keeping Yanks' Offer In His Pocket

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER; Jack Curry contributed reporting.

 BODY:
There was an episode of ''Curb Your Enthusiasm'' in which Larry David desperately tried to give away a sweaty $50 bill he got from a friend's sneaker. The money was legal tender, but nobody wanted it. The Yankees know the feeling.
 On Friday, it will be four weeks since they barreled into the free-agent negotiating period with a six-year, $140 million offer to the free-agent pitcher C. C. Sabathia. His response has been silence. Derek Jeter had already called Sabathia by then, and Alex Rodriguez has called him since. Yet the offer sits there, an anomaly in a depressed market, begging to be accepted but met with indifference. 
 It is usually not this way for the Yankees, who typically identify their desired player, overwhelm him with an early offer, intimidate the competition and get their man. They have done the first three things, but Sabathia is still a free agent.
 ''If they went to Sabathia with $140 million, he could go back to them and say, 'Give me $170 million and I'm there,' '' said one major league general manager, who was granted anonymity so he could freely discuss another team's plans. ''He hasn't done that. The Yankees aren't his first choice. Why isn't he jumping on their offer?'' 
 The Yankees have continued to negotiate with Sabathia, and they would like to sign him during the winter meetings in Las Vegas next week. But they have not sensed the usual enthusiasm that accompanies a splashy Yankees offer. 
 Mike Mussina signed quickly after the 2000 season. A year later, there was never much doubt about Jason Giambi's intention. Both times, the Yankees had just been to the World Series. Both players wanted to be in New York -- or, in Mussina's case, somewhere close to his Pennsylvania home -- and both had a veteran agent, Arn Tellem.
 Sabathia is a different case entirely, and the reason he is stalling, to those who know him, is just as the general manager suspected: his first choice is not New York. Sabathia is from Vallejo, Calif., near the San Francisco Bay Area, and it is well known that his preference is to play for a team on the West Coast. But the money is elsewhere.
 ''It's not that he doesn't want to be a Yankee; that's not it at all,'' said a friend of Sabathia's, who was granted anonymity because Sabathia had not authorized him to speak on his behalf. ''It's just the aspect of being out there, his family, that kind of stuff.''
 Sabathia and his agent, Greg Genske, have made no public comments lately. Genske has kept a low profile since taking over Jeff Moorad's agency when Moorad left to run the Arizona Diamondbacks in 2004. Sabathia is the most prominent free agent Genske has represented; he was fired in February by Manny Ramirez, who hired Scott Boras.
 The presence of Boras looms over Sabathia, too, because of another Boras client: Mark Teixeira, the free-agent first baseman for the Los Angeles Angels.
 Teixeira is seeking a 10-year contract worth $200 million, and Boras often waits until deep into the winter before making a deal. If the Angels sign Teixeira to a new contract -- as they insist they are trying to do -- they would probably not sign Sabathia. But if Teixeira leaves, the theory goes, they may. 
 That seems unlikely, especially after the Angels offered salary arbitration to starter Jon Garland, who may well take it after a poor second half of the 2008 season. But the hope of an overture from the Angels, apparently, explains Sabathia's delay.
 The Yankees have long understood that Sabathia might be reluctant to sign, but they assessed the market and believed no other team could approach what they could offer. The Milwaukee Brewers, the team Sabathia carried to the playoffs last season, have offered $100 million for five years. Just as the Yankees suspected, there are no other known suitors.
 The San Francisco Giants have been aggressive this offseason, guaranteeing more than $16 million for next season to shortstop Edgar Renteria, and relievers Jeremy Affeldt and Bobby Howry. They also have five years left on Barry Zito's seven-year, $126 million contract, and annual debt service to finance their ballpark.
 In other words, there may not be much money left for Sabathia -- certainly not $23 million per season, and probably no more than a $90 million guarantee. 
 Yet until Sabathia is convinced there are no lucrative offers on the West Coast, there is no urgency for him to sign with the Yankees. Hal Steinbrenner of the Yankees said on Nov. 21 that the Sabathia offer was ''not going to be there forever.''
 But with no other starters having signed with the Yankees -- not even their own Andy Pettitte -- it is hard for the team to have leverage until the winter meetings begin Monday.
 The Yankees seem content to let A. J. Burnett sign with the Atlanta Braves, who may offer $60 million for four years with a vesting option for a fifth year. Two Boras clients -- Derek Lowe and Oliver Perez -- are probably the next-best free-agent starters, with Ben Sheets and Brad Penny coming off injuries.
 ''I'm not getting anxious,'' General Manager Brian Cashman said Thursday. ''It's part of the process, that's all.''
 It is a process being stalled by Teixeira, Sabathia and the economy, with teams that depend on credit suddenly turning frugal. The Yankees' thriving cable network and new stadium give them more cash than their rivals. They proved it to Sabathia four weeks ago, but the interest has not been mutual.

HEADLINE: Timing a Market

BYLINE: By STEVE BAILEY

 BODY:
ARE you thinking that this might be the time to buy a second home, that weekend getaway that you've always wanted? Or, are you struggling financially and feeling pressure to sell your own weekend home? How can a buyer know that he or she is getting the best deal, that the property you buy now won't be worth less in a few months? And, how can a seller know that selling now is a good idea? What if the market starts to recover in a few months?
 Neither buyer nor seller (nor any real estate agent) can see the future, but anyone can see that, right now, many properties aren't selling, at least not at the prices sellers want. There are, however, strategies for making the most of this market. 
 Diane Saatchi, a senior vice president with the Corcoran Group in the Hamptons, said her real estate market has certainly felt the impact of recent sharp drops in the stock market. ''When this all began in mid-September, some buyers backed out of deals not yet signed up,'' she wrote in an e-mail message. ''Some sellers offered better terms to keep the deals on course. In some cases, this worked, in others not. Many would-be buyers moved to the sidelines and/or lowered their price points in looking. 
 ''Some buyers have become more price-oriented. For example, there are buyers more concerned about size of discount than they are about location and amenities.''
 Though the market for vacation homes is not immune from economic reality, it does not shadow the total real estate market. ''While the overall housing market peaked in 2005, the market for vacation homes didn't peak until 2006,'' said Walter Molony, a spokesman for the National Association of Realtors in Washington. That doesn't mean, though, that a recovery in the second-home market will lag behind the larger market. ''A large number of our transactions are not subject to financing,'' Ms. Saatchi said of second-home sales in the Hamptons, so a rebound could occur if consumer confidence rises ahead of a loosening of credit. 
 If you have a vacation home that you're thinking of selling, this is almost certainly not the best time. ''It depends on the seller's needs,'' Neil B. Garfinkel, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said. ''For example, if he needs to get out from under a mortgage, he may have to sell.'' 
 The seller should be realistic about the market and realize that he is not going to get what he paid if he has owned the property only a short time. People who bought 5 or 10 years ago are more likely to see a profit, but nothing like what they would have realized a couple of years ago. A motivated seller can increase the odds in his favor by sprucing up the house to make it stand out among the many foreclosed houses, which are typically run-down, on the market. 
 ''Those who want to or have to sell now are pricing 'tight,' '' Ms. Saatchi said, meaning about as low as the seller can go. ''Listing brokers are advising sellers to discount from recent closed sales to set asking prices. With a large inventory, sellers are wise to price competitively to drive the most potential buyers to their properties. The adage 'you can always come down' does not work in this market as, if no one comes to look, there won't even be those low offers.'' 
 Some real estate agents have found that pricing below market can result in a higher selling price because the low asking price attracts more buyers.
 Many would-be sellers are waiting for prices to rise a bit; in the meantime, they're renting their properties, though the National Association of Realtors says that only about 15 percent of second-home owners traditionally rent out their houses. 
 If you're looking for a vacation home, you'll most likely find bargains, though some of the more desirable properties may have been taken off the market. You might pay particular attention to properties that have been on the market for more than three months, a sign that the seller may be willing to do what it takes to make a deal. When you do find what you want at a price you like, financing might be a problem. 
 ''Days of financing 90 percent are long gone,'' Mr. Garfinkel said. ''You'll need to put down at least 20 percent plus closing costs.''

HEADLINE: Liechtenstein To Share Some Secrets Of Its Bank

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

Liechtenstein, under increasing scrutiny for its role as a leading offshore tax haven, has promised to partly lift the veil of secrecy shrouding billions of dollars held there by wealthy American clients and corporations. 
 Liechtenstein, a tiny Alpine country, will now in limited circumstances turn over to United States investigators the bank records of American clients suspected of tax evasion. The agreement also covers questionable uses of a tactic, known as transfer pricing, that is widely employed by multinational American corporations to lower their tax bills. 
 But there is a catch: the agreement covers only clients who are already being investigated or prosecuted for tax evasion in the United States. That hurdle makes it unlikely that Liechtenstein will open the flood gates to foreign tax authorities, who are laboring to uncover the identities of suspected tax cheats. Unlike Liechtenstein and neighboring Switzerland, which make a distinction between tax evasion and tax fraud, the United States considers them to be the same thing, and both to be crimes. Only tax fraud is a criminal offense in Liechtenstein and Switzerland. 
 That catch led some tax authorities to call the agreement window-dressing. ''It doesn't do anything,'' said Jack A. Blum, an authority on offshore fraud. ''They're offering to give up what we already know.'' 
 Liechtenstein is one of three European countries -- the other two are Monaco and Andorra -- that have been put on a blacklist by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as uncooperative tax havens where clients park assets to evade taxes in their home countries. 
 The agreement, to be signed next Monday in Vaduz, Liechtenstein's capital, comes after growing scrutiny of the country by investigators in the United States, Germany and elsewhere in Europe after the theft in 2002 of confidential client data by a former employee at the LGT Group, a financial behemoth owned and run by Liechtenstein's royal family. 
 The employee, Heinrich Kieber, provided the data to tax authorities in Britain, Germany and the United States, which contend it details billions of dollars of tax evasion by 1,400 LGT clients, including 150 in the United States. 
 A spokesman for the embassy of Liechtenstein in Washington, Matthew J. Keller, said Thursday that the agreement did not affect its commitment to preserving Swiss-style banking secrecy. ''Privacy will continue to be protected under this agreement,'' he said. ''There's a lot of criteria that the U.S. side has to meet before the information is shared.'' He added that one requirement would be for United States investigators to prove they have already obtained significant information, including names and allegations, of those suspected of tax evasion.
 The deal will run for two years and starts in 2010, which could give federal prosecutors time to prepare criminal cases against clients whose details were provided by Mr. Kieber, whose lawyer is Mr. Blum. The Internal Revenue Service has names of other LGT clients as well. 
 Mr. Kieber's data has already dragged prominent names into the spotlight. In July, an investigation by United States authorities exposed a top LGT client, Peter Lowy, an Austrian real estate billionaire.
 In February, German authorities used Mr. Kieber's data to raid the home of Klaus Zumwinkel, a leading corporate figure and the former chief of Germany's postal system.

HEADLINE: Merck Offers a Cautious Forecast for 2009

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Merck & Company forecast 2009 earnings and revenue below Wall Street expectations on Thursday, citing a harsh impact from the stronger dollar and continuing sluggish sales of several big medicines.
 The drug maker, whose shares fell 4 percent in morning trading, projected flat or little 2009 growth for sales of three major products: the asthma medicine Singulair, the blood-pressure drug Cozaar and the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil.
 ''It is possible that, as in the past, this is intentionally conservative initial guidance that will be revised upwards through the year but we cannot be certain,'' a Sanford C. Bernstein analyst, Tim Anderson, said in a research note. Between foreign exchange rates and several struggling franchises,'' he said, ''the company does face significant headwinds in '09 and possibly beyond.'' 
 Merck's chief financial officer, Peter Kellogg, also told analysts in a conference call that he expected combined global sales of its Vytorin and Zetia cholesterol fighters, which Merck sells in partnership with Schering-Plough, to fall next year because of flagging United States demand.
 On the positive side, Merck projected strong growth for its relatively new Januvia diabetes franchise, as well as for its HIV drug Isentress and shingles vaccine Zostavax. The company also expects to seek approval next year for two new medicines for migraines and acute heart failure.
 The New Jersey-based drug maker has experienced sluggish demand for Singulair and its cholesterol drugs because of safety or effectiveness worries, while its osteoporosis drug Fosamax faces generic competition. Merck said in October it was cutting 7,200 positions, adding to cuts from an earlier restructuring.
 Merck, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average, said on Thursday that it expected 2009 earnings, excluding special items, of $3.15 to $3.30 a share. Analysts polled by Reuters Estimates were expecting $3.52, on average. The 2009 forecast excludes restructuring charges of $400 million to $600 million.
 Merck said it expects global sales next year of $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion, little changed from expected 2008 revenue and shy of the $24.7 billion expected by analysts.
 ''We anticipate that top-line growth will be offset by the effects of a volatile global economy, fluctuations in the foreign exchange markets, as well as continued challenges for certain key products,'' Merck's chief executive, Richard Clark, said in a statement.
 Merck said the strengthening dollar would crimp 2009 revenue by 3 percentage points, while having a negative 6 percent impact on earnings per share.
 Some analysts had predicted Merck would issue a conservative 2009 forecast, given the unfavorable foreign currency swing.
 Revenue of United States drug makers in recent years has been greatly bolstered by a weak dollar, which increases the value of overseas sales when converted back into American currency. But the stronger dollar may now turn currency trends against the companies.
 Even so, Merck stuck to its earlier long-range forecast of compound earnings per-share growth in the mid-to-high single digit range from 2005 to 2010, excluding special items. It also backed its 2008 forecast of $3.28 to $3.32 a share, excluding items.
 Mr. Clark told the Reuters Health Summit last month that he expected profit growth for the company from 2010 to 2013 despite looming generic competition for Cozaar and Singulair. He also said Merck had the appetite to buy a big biotechnology company if the right deal came along.
 Through Wednesday, Merck shares had fallen some 54 percent this year.

HEADLINE: Despite Protests, U.S. Is to Auction Landing Slots at J.F.K., La Guardia and Newark

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD and KEN BELSON; Matthew L. Wald reported from Washington and Ken Belson from New York.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Amid a chorus of objections, the Bush administration is moving full speed toward auctioning landing slots at Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Liberty airports. 
 The Transportation Department held a three-hour meeting on Thursday with about 80 airline executives and lawyers to explain how it would determine how many slots would be taken from current users and put up for auction. On Friday, about the same number of people are to attend a seminar on how to bid. 
 The administration describes the auction as a way to use market principles -- mainly money -- to ration a scarce commodity, the right to land in the New York area. It has already capped operations at all three airports, in an effort to reduce delays.
 But the airlines, which are asserting that they own the slots in question, hate the idea of an auction. 
 Delta said in a statement: ''The last thing the administration should do in its final days -- especially in light of the flagging economy -- is inconvenience passengers who have already booked flights, raise their fares, threaten jobs, and undermine the hundreds of millions in investments airlines have made in the New York-area market.''
 Sarah Echols, a Transportation Department spokeswoman, said the flight caps combined with auctions would ''reduce congestion, keep air fares competitive and increase travel options in the New York aviation market.''
 The auctions, she said, would protect ''the vast majority of flights by incumbent carriers.''
 The auction is scheduled for next Friday, with results announced soon afterward; the changes are to take effect at La Guardia in March and at Kennedy and Newark in October.
 If the auction is not overturned by the courts or Congress -- and either seems possible -- it could be the last significant transportation action of the Bush administration, which leaves on Jan. 20.
 What is being auctioned is the right to land, or take off, within a half-hour period for 10 years. The reserve price -- below which the slot will not be sold -- is $10,000 for peak hours and $100 for off-peak, but the president of the auction company, Lawrence M. Ausubel of Power Auctions, said that those numbers were likely to be ''well exceeded.'' 
 Mr. Ausubel said he did not know of any prior auction of airport slots.

HEADLINE: A Wink to Theatergoers, and Nods to Broadway

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
A HUMOROUS campaign for a coming musical is awash in green, perhaps reflecting how hard it can be to make money on Broadway these days.
 ''Shrek the Musical,'' scheduled to open on Dec. 14, is the subject of the colorful campaign, which began on Monday. Just as the three ''Shrek'' films parody old-school fairy tales and the movies based on them, ''Shrek the Musical'' spoofs Broadway musical theater. 
 The posters poke fun at songs and song titles from other musicals like ''A Chorus Line,'' ''Evita,'' ''Gypsy,'' ''Hello, Dolly,'' ''Man of La Mancha,'' ''My Fair Lady'' and ''Sweet Charity.''
 The posters went up as part of a takeover of ad space in the Times Square subway station, known as station domination, which will continue through Dec. 31. There are also ads that wrap around columns and are pasted on stairways. 
 The campaign is indicative of the increasingly elaborate efforts devoted to the creation of ads for entertainment properties. As the financial crisis forces marketers like automakers, financial institutions and retailers to cut back ad spending, pitches for shows, movies, DVDs, video games and other forms of amusement -- which typically retain their appeal for consumers during economic downturns -- are taking on more prominence.
 That means consumers will confront a cacophony of players competing for their entertainment dollars. So newcomers like ''Shrek the Musical,'' at the Broadway Theater, must work hard to stand out amid the clamor and clutter. 
 ''We're opening in the very, very busy holiday season,'' said Bill Damaschke, president at DreamWorks Theatricals in New York, part of DreamWorks Animation SKG, which is ''good in many ways'' because large numbers of people are seeking entertainment.
 Still, it also means ''there are lots of other choices,'' he added, which include holiday movies as well as other Broadway shows.
 The theme of the Shrek ads sets the tone: ''Broadway's getting a make-ogre.'' 
 The campaign was created by SpotCo, a New York agency that specializes in theatrical advertising, and mirrors moments in ''Shrek the Musical'' that pay tongue-in-cheek homage to shows that include ''A Chorus Line,'' ''Gypsy'' and ''Wicked.''
 Another element of the campaign is a Web site called Shrekster, which mocks the conventions of social networking sites like Friendster and Facebook. ''Becoming a member is as free as wishing on a star or eating someone else's porridge,'' the site (shrekster.com) proclaims. ''All you need to join is an e-mail address and a password.''
 Shrekster offers content like profiles of characters from ''Shrek the Musical,'' as well as make-believe theatrical news under headlines like ''Wolf Eats 3 Ladies for Lunch in Horrific Matinee Attack.''
 The campaign for ''Shrek the Musical,'' which is now in previews, also includes advertisements in newspapers, an e-mail newsletter and a second Web site (shrekthemusical.com). The signature color of the campaign is green, in tribute to Shrek the ogre.
 ''We have a great built-in audience of people who love the 'Shrek' films, but we're not relying totally on that,'' Mr. Damaschke said. ''We're reaching out to people who go to the theater, who live in the area and who are tourists.''
 The stakes are high for ''Shrek the Musical'' for a couple of reasons. It is the first production for DreamWorks Theatricals, which is hoping to emulate the success found on Broadway by the Walt Disney Company with musical versions of films like ''Beauty and the Beast'' and ''The Lion King.''
 Another reason ''Shrek the Musical'' is high-risk, high-reward is that ''shows the size and scale of ours are expensive,'' Mr. Damaschke said, estimating the cost at ''north of $20 million.''
 The perilous state of the economy is taking its toll on Broadway, too. Musicals that have recently posted closing notices include ''Hairspray,'' ''Spamalot,'' ''Spring Awakening,'' ''13'' and ''Young Frankenstein.''
 For all the inside jokes that fill the campaign, ''the beauty of 'Shrek' is there's something for everyone in it,'' said Drew Hodges, chief executive at SpotCo, part of the First Artist Corporation. ''Kids love the story, the characters, the irreverence,'' he added, ''and parents love the wink to it,'' which signals to each of them: '' 'It's witty. I won't have to put my brain out to pasture while I enjoy it.' ''
 That is what the campaign hopes to convey with Broadway-centric satire that started with an ad when tickets first went on sale. The ad parodied the daily newspaper listings for Broadway shows, known as the ABCs.
 Every show in the mock ABCs sponsored by ''Shrek the Musical'' sent up Broadway and fairy tales. There was ''Hair,'' starring Rapunzel; ''Princess on the Edge,'' starring Princess Fiona; ''A Wooden Soldier's Song,'' starring Geppetto; and ''Heather Has Two Mama Bears.''
 The campaigns for Broadway shows ''are the coming attractions for Broadway,'' Mr. Hodges said, likening the ads to trailers for movies. ''They give you an idea of what the show is like.''
 The next phase of the campaign is in the same vein as the fake ABCs. An oversize poster that features 25 cast members of ''Shrek the Musical'' carries the headline ''One Storybook Sensation,'' a play on the phrase ''One Singular Sensation'' from ''A Chorus Line.''
 Another poster, depicting Shrek, twists the title of another song from ''A Chorus Line.'' Instead of ''Dance 10, Looks 3,'' it reads, ''Dance 10, Looks 3.''
 A parody of ''Gypsy'' features Shrek, too, under the headline ''Everything's Coming Up Ogres.'' The word Shrek is spelled out in light bulbs, mimicking the logo for ''Gypsy.''
 Shrek's friend, Donkey, turns up in ads that spoof ''Hello, Dolly'' (''Hello, Donkey! Well hello, Donkey!'') and ''Man of La Mancha'' (''I Am I, Donkey-Xote, the Lord of La Mancha''). Fiona is featured in ads that parody shows like ''Sweet Charity'' (''If My Friends Could Free Me Now'').
 Lord Farquaad appears in ads that spoof shows like ''Evita''; one shows him behind a bank of microphones, arms raised Evita-style, under the headline ''Don't Cry for Me, Duloc.''
 Although the songs and shows being spoofed are ''so classic and so iconic,'' Mr. Damaschke said, he acknowledged that ''some of these may go over people's heads.'' Even so, ''the artwork and headlines are compelling,'' he added, and people still ''can see there's a show that stars Shrek and Donkey and Fiona and Farquaad.''
 Mr. Damaschke and Mr. Hodges said they were planning additional phases of the campaign.
 ''It's a long-term investment,'' Mr. Damaschke said, reflecting the goal of having ''Shrek the Musical'' become a long-running hit. ''We're seeding things like Shrekster and other things online that could be for many, many years.'' 
 ''Shrek the Musical'' is not the first show to offer japes and jests about Broadway. Others include the ''Forbidden Broadway'' revues as well as musicals like ''Curtains,'' ''Kiss Me Kate,'' ''Me and Juliet'' and ''Spamalot.''
 And in ''Once Upon a Mattress,'' based on the fairy tale ''The Princess and the Pea,'' the princess wonders in a song why she cannot end up living ''Happily Ever After'' like such fairy-tale characters as Cinderella, Rapunzel and Snow White.

HEADLINE: Strangers May Cheer You Up, Study Says

BYLINE: By PAM BELLUCK

 BODY:
How happy you are may depend on how happy your friends' friends' friends are, even if you don't know them at all. 
 And a cheery next-door neighbor has more effect on your happiness than your spouse's mood. 
 So says a new study that followed a large group of people for 20 years -- happiness is more contagious than previously thought.
 ''Your happiness depends not just on your choices and actions, but also on the choices and actions of people you don't even know who are one, two and three degrees removed from you,'' said Dr. Nicholas A. Christakis, a physician and social scientist at Harvard Medical School and an author of the study, to be published Friday in BMJ, a British journal. ''There's kind of an emotional quiet riot that occurs and takes on a life of its own, that people themselves may be unaware of. Emotions have a collective existence -- they are not just an individual phenomenon.'' 
 In fact, said his co-author, James H. Fowler, an associate professor of political science at University of California, San Diego, their research found that ''if your friend's friend's friend becomes happy, that has a bigger impact on you being happy than putting an extra $5,000 in your pocket.''
 The researchers analyzed information on the happiness of 4,739 people and their connections with several thousand others -- spouses, relatives, close friends, neighbors and co-workers -- from 1983 to 2003.
 ''It's extremely important and interesting work,'' said Daniel Kahneman, an emeritus psychologist and Nobel laureate at Princeton, who was not involved in the study. Several social scientists and economists praised the data and analysis, but raised possible limitations.
 Steven Durlauf, an economist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, questioned whether the study proved that people became happy because of their social contacts or some unrelated reason.
 Dr. Kahneman said unless the findings were replicated, he could not accept that a spouse's happiness had less impact than a next-door neighbor. Dr. Christakis believes that indicates that people take emotional cues from their own gender. 
 A study also to be published Friday in BMJ, by Ethan Cohen-Cole, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, and Jason M. Fletcher, an assistant professor at the Yale School of Public Health, criticizes the methodology of the Christakis-Fowler team, saying that it is possible to find what look like social contagion effects with conditions like acne, headaches and height, but that contagion effects go away when researchers factor in environmental factors that friends or neighbors have in common.
 ''Researchers should be cautious in attributing correlations in health outcomes of close friends to social network effects,'' the authors say. 
 An accompanying BMJ editorial about the two studies called the Christakis-Fowler study ''groundbreaking,'' but said ''future work is needed to verify the presence and strength of these associations.''
 The team previously published studies concluding that obesity and quitting smoking are socially contagious. 
 But the happiness study, financed by the National Institute on Aging, is unusual in several ways. Happiness would seem to be ''the epitome of an individualistic state,'' said John T. Cacioppo, director of the University of Chicago's Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience, who was not involved in the study.
 And what about schadenfreude - pleasure in someone's misery - or good old-fashioned envy when a friend lands a promotion or wins the marathon? ''There may be some people who become unhappy when their friends become happy, but we found that more people become happy over all,'' Dr. Christakis said. 
 Professor Cacioppo said that suggested that unconscious signals of well-being packed more zing than conscious feelings of resentment. ''I might be jealous of the fact that they won the lottery, but they're in such a good mood that I walk away feeling happier without even being aware that they were the site for my happiness,'' he said.
 The subtle transmission of emotion may explain other findings, too. In the obesity and smoking cessation studies, friends were influential even if they lived far away. But the effect on happiness was much greater from friends, siblings or neighbors who lived nearby. 
 A next-door neighbor's joy increased one's chance of being happy by 34 percent, but a neighbor down the block had no effect. A friend living half a mile away was good for a 42 percent bounce, but the effect was almost half that for a friend two miles away. A friend in a different community altogether can win an Oscar without making you feel better.
 ''You have to see them and be in physical and temporal proximity,'' Dr. Christakis said. 
 Body language and emotional signals must matter, said Professor Fowler, adding, ''Everybody thought when they came out with videoconferencing that people would stop flying across the country to have meetings, but that didn't happen. Part of developing trust with another person is being able to take their hand in yours.''
 Still, they said, it is not clear if increased communication via e-mail messages and Webcams may eventually lessen the distance effect. In a separate study of 1,700 Facebook profiles, they found that people smiling in their photographs had more Facebook friends and that more of those friends were smiling. ''That shows that some of our findings are generalizable to the online world,'' Dr. Christakis said. 
 The BMJ study used data from the federal Framingham Heart Study, which began following people in Framingham, Mass., after World War II and ultimately followed their children and grandchildren. Beginning in 1983, participants periodically completed questionnaires on their emotional well-being. 
 They also listed family members, close friends and workplaces, so researchers could track them over time. Many of those associates were Framingham participants who also completed questionnaires, giving Dr. Christakis and Professor Fowler about 50,000 social ties to analyze. They found that when people changed from unhappy to happy in self-reported responses on a widely used measure of well-being, other people in their social network became happy too. 
 Sadness was transmitted the same way, but not as reliably as happiness. Professor Cacioppo believes that reflects an evolutionary tendency to ''select into circumstances that allow us to stay in a good mood.''
 Still, happiness has a shelf life, the researchers found. 
 ''Your happiness affects my happiness only if you've become happy in the last year -- it's almost like what have you done for me lately,'' Dr. Christakis said. Plus, the bounce you get lasts a year tops. Better if your friends can spread out their happy news, and not, say, all get married the same year. 
 Another surprising finding was that a joyful coworker did not lift the spirits of colleagues, unless they were friends. Professor Fowler believes inherent competition at work might cancel out a happy colleague's positive vibes.
 The researchers cautioned that social contacts were less important to happiness than someone's personal circumstances. But the effect of social contacts even three degrees removed -- friends of friends of friends -- was clear, and also occurred with obesity and quitting smoking. More distant contacts exerted no influence. 
 And people in the center of social networks were happier than those on the fringes. Being popular was good, especially if friends were popular too.
 So should you dump melancholy friends? The authors say no. Better to spread happiness by improving life for people you know. 
 ''This now makes me feel so much more responsible that I know that if I come home in a bad mood I'm not only affecting my wife and son but my son's best friend or my wife's mother,'' Professor Fowler said. When heading home, ''I now intentionally put on my favorite song.''
 Still, he said, ''We are not giving you the advice to start smiling at everyone you meet in New York. That would be dangerous.''

HEADLINE: Reality Check for Detroit

 BODY:
Detroit's auto executives have the most tenuous grasp of their grim situation. Two weeks ago, they said they needed $25 billion from taxpayers. By last Tuesday they were asking for $34 billion. Now they say they have plans to turn around their companies. 
 The plans are fairly credible, but the chief executives from the Big Three auto companies left two things in Detroit. One was a believable commitment to transform themselves into businesses that make fuel-efficient cars, even when gas is cheap. The other was their letters of resignation. 
 Before giving General Motors, Ford and Chrysler the money they need, Congress should require much tighter commitments on fuel economy. It should establish a stringent system to ensure compliance and demand that top management be replaced. 
 From a financial standpoint, the restructuring plans offer a reasonable chance that the companies can emerge as viable businesses, better able to compete with the Japanese transplants.
 G.M., which asked for $18 billion in loans -- $4 billion of it to get through the year -- offered to get rid of several brands, close nine factories, slash its work force by 20 percent and cut some $30 billion worth of debt. Chrysler, the smallest and most vulnerable of the three, asked for $7 billion now in exchange for cutting costs by $4 billion in 2009. Ford, which said it could survive without taxpayer cash but asked for $9 billion just in case, presented a plan to be profitable by 2011.
 The autoworkers' union is on board and is offering concessions that include allowing the companies to delay paying into the fund that would take over the burden of providing health insurance for retirees. All three companies laid out plans to change their mix of models.
 G.M. said it would offer 15 hybrid models by 2012. Its Chevy Volt, which can travel up to 40 miles on electric power, is scheduled for production in 2010. Chrysler also said it would offer an all-electric automobile. Ford said it would cut trucks, vans and sport-utility vehicles to 40 percent of its portfolio from 52 percent in three years and would put more fuel-efficient engines in most of its cars.
 Congress should ask for more. There are solid grounds to mistrust Detroit's Bit Three. As the price of gasoline drifts back below $2 a gallon, they face a powerful incentive to slip on the drive for better mileage and new fuels and to fall back on the gas-guzzlers they know.
 Congress, hardly blameless in this crisis, must not allow that to happen. For starters, it must demand that the three companies' top executives resign. Only new management can enforce the deep cultural change needed to overhaul the industry. And, it must impose real, enforceable environmental rules. The European Union is aiming for a fleetwide fuel-economy of 50 miles per gallon in 2015. In the United States, Congress last year enacted a target of 35 miles per gallon by 2020. 
 Experts say that Detroit's automakers could achieve 43 m.p.g. by then even without technological breakthroughs. If the companies were willing to make smaller cars, they could achieve 50 m.p.g. Congress could consider demanding that Detroit simply phase out S.U.V.'s and vans by a certain date. 
 If the economy were growing, it might have been a better idea to let one or more of the three go bankrupt, restructure and emerge smaller and lither. But in a bitter recession, the risk that a bankruptcy filing would snowball and produce catastrophic unemployment is too large to take. A bailout offers a chance to put the car companies on a track to a more fuel-efficient future.

HEADLINE: DuPont Cuts 2,500 Jobs and Warns of 4th-Quarter Loss

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
DuPont, the chemical maker, said Thursday that it expected to post a fourth-quarter loss and cut 2,500 jobs -- about 4.2 percent of its work force -- as construction, car sales and consumer spending dropped. 
 The slump in the automotive markets has badly hurt DuPont, one of the largest suppliers of paints to carmakers. The company has also been troubled by the collapse in the housing market, as it supplies coatings, countertops and insulation products used in home building.
 DuPont said it wanted cuts of $600 million for 2009, up from its previous goal of $200 million.
 That change is on top of $130 million in cost reductions expected from Thursday's reorganization plan, which will result in a charge of $500 million in the fourth quarter.
 DuPont, based in Wilmington, Del., expects a fourth-quarter loss of 20 to 30 cents a share, excluding one-time items, a sharp turnabout from the earnings of 20 to 25 cents it had earlier forecast.
 Analysts were expecting profit of 23 cents a share for the period, according to Reuters Estimates.
 The company said sharply lower sales volumes and the resulting lower plant operating rates forced it to lower its forecast.
 DuPont expects fourth-quarter sales to fall at least 15 percent from a year earlier, mainly because of a significant decline in worldwide sales volumes. For 2009, the company forecast earnings of $2.25 to $2.75 a share, below the current Wall Street outlook of $2.82.
 DuPont is also cutting the jobs of 4,000 contractors by the end of the year, with additional reductions planned for 2009.
 In addition, the company is putting in place work schedule reductions at some locations.

HEADLINE: Now in Residence: Walls of Luscious Austerity

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

DATELINE: NORTH ADAMS, Mass. 

 BODY:
The Conceptual artist Sol LeWitt, who died last year, was our Fra Angelico. And the three-story 19th-century mill here, housing a survey of his panoramic wall drawings, is our Museo di San Marco: a building full of art conceived by one artist, executed by many hands, devoted to big ideas. So it will be for the next quarter century, which is how long ''Sol LeWitt: A Wall Drawing Retrospective'' is scheduled to run. 
 The setting is close to perfect. The space, with its generous windows, is large and flexible enough to accommodate more than a hundred of the ink-painting murals LeWitt designed between 1969 and 2007. On the campus of the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, set amid stony hills in a working-class New England town, the site suits the stringently sensuous, anyone-can-make-it spirit of his art. 
 The show's timing is as ideal as it is regrettable. It is a pity that LeWitt, who conceived this project in collaboration with the Yale University Art Gallery and worked closely with Mass MoCA and the Williams College Museum of Art on its realization, couldn't have seen the results, which look organic and embracing in a way that his 2000 traveling museum survey did not. He often said that beauty was not the point of his art, but the Mass MoCA installation is pretty gorgeous. 
 And no art, we suddenly see, is better suited to meet hard economic times. Most of the materials used in the wall drawings are five-and-dime simple: pencils, colored ink, crayons, brushes, paper. You could tote them around in a shopping bag, ready to tackle the first empty wall you found. 
 Not that these drawings are street art. They aren't populist in that way; they were meant for the great indoors. But neither do they depend on elite settings -- museums or galleries -- to make sense. They are abstract, not arcane. Their visual effects can be complex, but their language is plain: lines, colors, clean surfaces, the basics of grade-school art class. No wonder they feel welcoming; they take us back to the past before they take us somewhere else. 
 Within those essential elements there's diversity. The lines come straight and curved; vertical, diagonal, horizontal. They resolve into geometric shapes (cubes, grids, bulls'-eyes); they splinter and fight; they gather in doodly squiggles like metal shavings to a magnet. In many cases they simply stream on, parallel and continuous, from floor to ceiling and wall edge to wall edge, like some crazy, destinationless Bruckner scherzo that expresses high joy by running in place. 
 Most of the surfaces are matte and dry like frescos, though in one piece, first done in Germany in 1999, vertical bands of saturated colors are interrupted by a glossy black splat of thick acrylic. And within matte surfaces visual textures subtly vary depending on whether color has been drawn, brushed, washed or dabbed on. 
 The color range is dramatic. Early drawings from the 1970s are diagrammatic patterns of blue or black lines on white ground connecting corners of walls with door jambs and the odd fire-alarm unit. They might look mathematical or scientific, expressions of an American mania for measuring and surveying, if their logic wasn't so batty. As it is, they turn the very idea of calculation into a game. They connect dots, but to no purpose. They turn space into a walk-in cat's cradle. 
 By the 1980s, though, color had replaced or equaled line as a primary element. And the entire chromatic spectrum was brought into play. Sometimes hues were tamped down, but just as often they were high-keyed and brash, giving certain drawings -- I'm thinking of a composition of snaking orange and green bands -- the retinal hilarity of Op Art. 
 Lusciousness and austerity alternated over 40 years, but through all the blossomings and thinnings, this art remains, at a fundamental level, ordinary, modest, graspable, doable. It also stays resolutely impersonal, never sticking for long with any single graphic style, never showcasing a distinctive touch, never carrying a signature. 
 Although LeWitt came up with the initial designs, his relationship to the work was otherwise hands-off. He wrote instructions for how the work should be done -- firm but easy-to-follow recipes with occasional sweeten-to-taste allowances -- but hired other artists to do it. Some he trained, with the expectation that they would train others, who would in turn train still others, stretching on through generations. 
 To help assure smooth continuity, he devised art that didn't require virtuosic talent, just straightforward artisan skills and patient attention. If a drawing was done correctly that was enough. 
 But the fact that LeWitt asked teams to do the work was significant. On a strictly practical level, this meant each piece could be expeditiously recreated. At the same time the collaborative model offered an alternative to a star-obsessed market. And, like a kind of mini private-sector version of the Works Progress Administration, it gave artists paying jobs doing what they liked to do. 
 Finally, he understood, as every teacher does, that doing preset tasks could stimulate creativity. Many of his drawings were done by supervised groups of art students -- those at Mass MoCA included -- in a learning-on-the-job tradition very similar to Renaissance workshop practice. A master artist provides the overarching concept; senior artists oversee production; apprentices do the grunt work and in the process discover and develop ideas of their own. 
 LeWitt's work is, famously, about ideas before all else. He was one of the first artists to formally define -- in a 1967 Artforum article -- Conceptual Art. And he was among the first to make work that fit the definition: work that played down the unique art object, with its associations of individual genius, exchange value and physical permanence, in favor of utopian proposals, collective visions, objects that existed first and last as ideas. (''The wall drawing is a permanent installation, until destroyed,'' LeWitt wrote in 1970.)
 A small show called ''The ABCDs of Sol LeWitt'' at the Williams College Museum of Art, near Mass MoCA, zeroes in on that watershed 1960s moment with an archival display of his manuscripts and drawings, including a draft of the Artforum article with the words that put LeWitt's career on the map: 
 ''When an artist uses a conceptual form of art, it means that all the planning and decisions are made beforehand, and execution is a perfunctory affair. The idea becomes a machine that makes the art.'' The wall drawings are prime examples of this definition in action.
 Historically speaking, a visit to Mass MoCA should come after a look at the Williams College show, which has been organized by Lisa Corrin, the museum's director, and Erica DiBenedetto, an art history student. (LeWitt would have appreciated the leveling.) But there is something to be said for seeing the wall drawings first: for just walking straight into the grand apparatus of concept and color, and letting it sing and shout and whisper around you. 
 After all, do you need to know the theological ideas behind the virgins and angels painted on the walls of San Marco by Fra Angelico and his anonymous assistants in order to be entranced? No. You will eventually want to know about those ideas 0f salvation and eternity, just as you will want to learn about the ideas -- collaboration, generosity, the embrace of ephemerality -- that underpin LeWitt's art and make it, now more than ever, exemplary. 
 The ideas in Fra Angelico's frescos are demanding and unworldly. The ideas in LeWitt's drawings -- in the monumental, abstract annunciations and visitations and sacred conversations at Mass MoCA -- are exhilarating and of this moment on earth. So are we talking about Conceptual Art or spiritual art? I'd say both. 
 ''Sol LeWitt: A Wall Drawing Retrospective'' will remain on view for 25 years at Mass MoCA, North Adams, Mass., (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. ''The ABCDs of Sol LeWitt'' continues through May 17 at Williams College Museum of Art, Williamstown, Mass., (413) 597-2429, wcma.org.

 IRAQ COUNCIL APPROVES U.S. PACT 
 With Referendum Set for July
 Iraq's three-person Presidency Council approved a security agreement that calls for the withdrawal of American forces, the last step needed for its official adoption. But the continuing challenges for Iraq were underscored by the widespread violence around the country on Thursday, with bombings in several cities that left dozens killed or wounded. PAGE A18
 THAI KING FORGOES ANNUAL ADDRESS
 King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand, pictured above during a military parade on Tuesday, did not appear to deliver his traditional birthday address, though many of his subjects had been waiting for his calming words at this time of political turmoil in the country. A crown princess said the king was receiving medical attention for a throat infection. But some analysts said the complexities of the political fractures might have convinced the king that silence was the best approach. PAGE A10 
 BRITAIN'S DNA DATABASE FAULTED
 The European Court of Human Rights ruled unanimously that Britain's policy of gathering and storing the fingerprints and DNA of all criminal suspects -- even those who turn out to be innocent -- was a violation of privacy rights. Britain has several months to decide how to respond, but the current law will have to be amended. PAGE A19
 THE CONTAGION OF HAPPINESS
 A new study suggests that happiness is more contagious than previously thought, and that how happy you are may depend on people you do not even know. One author said the research found that ''if your friend's friend's friend becomes happy, that has a bigger impact on you being happy than putting an extra $5,000 in your pocket.'' Not everyone is persuaded. PAGE A12
 TEST SHOWS SPAIN'S ETHNIC MIX
 The genetic signatures of people in Spain and Portugal provide new evidence of the mass conversions of Sephardic Jews and Muslims to Catholicism in the 15th and 16th centuries after Christian armies wrested Spain back from Muslim control, a team of geneticists reports. Twenty percent of the population of the Iberian Peninsula have Sephardic Jewish ancestry and 11 percent have DNA reflecting Moorish ancestors, the geneticists have found. PAGE A12
 FRANCE INTRODUCES STIMULUS PLAN
 France will spend $33 billion over the next two years to soften the blow of the global downturn and limit the effects of increasing unemployment, President Nicolas Sarkozy said. The plan includes aid to the country's ailing auto industry, which employs 10 percent of the French work force; money for the construction industry; and acceleration of tax credits and rebates that are owed to companies.

 To a Sought-After Flood Barrier
 The Army Corps of Engineers broke ground on what it described as the linchpin in its plan to protect New Orleans from hurricanes, a giant floodwall stretching across the eastern waterways that proved so deadly in Hurricane Katrina. The two-mile-long barrier is intended to protect vulnerable areas like the Lower Ninth Ward and New Orleans East and is expected to be completed by 2011. PAGE A24
 CHARGES IN DEATH BY MACHINE GUN
 A Massachusetts police chief, two Connecticut men and a gun club were indicted on involuntary manslaughter charges in the case of an 8-year-old boy who died at a firearms show in October. The boy accidentally shot himself in the head while firing a submachine gun at a firearms expo in Westfield, Mass., where it is illegal for anyone under 18 to fire a machine gun. PAGE A25

 Emergency shelters, a place where troubled teenagers receive anger-management lessons, social skills classes and counseling, are a system of aid for adolescents that represents a major shift in thinking around the country: earlier intervention when families are boiling over, rather than waiting until the children end up in costly, soul-crushing detention centers or foster care.

 The Bush administration is holding meetings with airline executives and lawyers to explain its plan to auction landing slots at Kennedy International, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International airports.

 YANKEES' PURSUIT OF SABATHIA

 This is the way it usually goes: The Yankees identify a desired player, overwhelm him with money, intimidate the competition and get their man. Yet it has been four weeks since they made a six-year, $140 million offer to the free-agent pitcher C. C. Sabathia. His response has been silence, an apparent lack of enthusiasm that suggests he would rather play elsewhere -- like the West Coast. PAGE B10
 MISSED IT BY THAT MUCH
 ''The Glory Game,'' written with Peter Richmond, has helped cast Frank Gifford as the leading man of 1958 N.F.L. championship game nostalgia. And among his unwavering assertions is that, had the ball been placed in the right spot after his attempted run for a first down late in the fourth quarter, the Giants might have won. Never mind the coming ESPN documentary, ''The Greatest Game Ever Played,'' which says he fell nine inches short. PAGE B11

 RETAILERS KICK OFF HOLIDAYS
 With Double-Digit Declines
 The nation's retailers had a dismal November, kicking off the holiday shopping season with double-digit declines across a broad spectrum of stores.

And those like Abercrombie & Fitch that did not get on the discount bandwagon, saw sales plummet. PAGE B1
 ENERGY GOALS CAN POSE CHALLENGE
 Congress and the incoming administration may soon impose a mandate that the nation get 10 or 15 percent of its electricity from renewable sources within a few years. A number of states have adopted similar goals, and a few have met or exceeded them. But over all, the record is mixed. PAGE B1
 SURPRISING CHOICE FOR SHAREHOLDERS
 The Reserve Primary Fund has presented its frustrated shareholders with a surprising choice: Be patient, and you might get back 98.5 cents for each dollar you had in the money market fund; continue to battle and you will get less, because the fund will use the money to defend itself. Though legal, the choice strikes some legal experts as perhaps a bit brazen. PAGE B1

 Liechtenstein, under increasing scrutiny for its role as a leading offshore tax haven, has agreed to turn over bank records to United States investigators in some circumstances.

 PRIVATE LIFE OF A PUBLIC TYRANT:
 Saddam Hussein's Rise and Fall
 ''House of Saddam,'' a four-part mini-series on HBO, goes deep inside the presidential palace to depict Hussein's rise to power and his fall. It is an intimate portrait of a paranoid tyrant who relied on family ties to stay in power and keep his country in check even after his devastating eight-year war with Iran, his reckless and failed invasion of Kuwait, and his bizarre cat-and-mouse games with the United Nations and Washington, Alessandra Stanley writes.

 HOLIDAY MUSIC IN LEANER TIMES
 As the recession tightens its grip, the holiday season could be less festive than usual. Much of this year's new holiday music -- including albums from artists like Sheryl Crow, the Flaming Lips and Jim Jones -- express some anxiety about whether the old modes of merriment still matter. Should we dismantle old standards? Create new ones? Or even bother celebrating at all? PAGE C18 
 THE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE IRAQ WAR
 In his book ''Unintended Consequences,'' the scholar and former diplomat Peter W. Galbraith not only reminds us that the Iraq war has been a costly, bungled operation but also argues that the war has had the opposite effect of virtually everything that President Bush and his administration promised the American public it would have. Certainly many readers will not agree with all of Mr. Galbraith's theories. But the book offers a lucid, pointed and often powerful deconstruction of the administration's blunders, Michiko Kakutani writes. PAGE C33
 A RETROSPECTIVE OF SOL LEWITT
 The Conceptual artist Sol LeWitt, who died last year, is now the subject of a show at Mass MoCA, the 19th-century mill turned museum in North Adams, Mass. ''Sol LeWitt: A Wall Drawing Retrospective,'' up for the next quarter century, is a survey of more than a hundred panoramic wall ink drawings designed between 1969 and 2007. With lusciousness and austerity alternated over 40 years, this art remains, at a fundamental level, ordinary, modest, graspable, doable, Holland Cotter writes. PAGE C25 BRUSH STROKES OF THE COOL
 The painter Barkley L. Hendricks did not birth the cool -- that was Miles Davis -- but his suave portraits from the 1960s, '70s and early '80s give him the right to use it as the title of his five-decade retrospective at the Studio Museum in Harlem. Mixing realism, abstraction and Pop, Mr. Hendricks's life-size paintings of beautiful black people in extravagantly fashionable outfits against flat, single-color backgrounds captured a period sensibility with uncanny acuity, Ken Johnson writes.

HEADLINE: Energy Sector Suffers as Oil Falls to the Lowest Level in 4 Years

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY and JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Stocks fell sharply Thursday and crude oil prices skittered to their lowest levels in nearly four years as fresh signs of economic weakness renewed fears about the depth and duration of the global downturn. 
 Energy companies bore the brunt of the market's losses as oil futures in New York slumped to $43.67 a barrel, their lowest point since January 2005. The price of oil has tumbled by 70 percent since settling at a peak of $145.27 on July 3 as the worst economic crisis in decades stifles global consumption.
 Markets had hung in limbo for most of the day as the heads of the Big Three automakers pleaded with lawmakers for a $34 billion rescue package, appearing to weather a battery of bleak indicators including falling retail sales and announcements of thousands of new layoffs at AT&T, DuPont and several media companies. Earlier in the day, central banks in Europe and Britain slashed interest rates to cushion a recession, ushering oil prices to a further downward trajectory. 
 But in a now-familiar pattern, Wall Street held out until the final hour of trading before it plunged, chipping away at two days of solid gains. Yields on long-term Treasuries fell to their lowest point in decades as investors continued to search for a safe place to warehouse their money. 
 ''It's almost a Pavlovian reaction,'' said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at the Hartford.
 Stocks fell across a broad range of sectors. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 2.5 percent, or 215.45 points, to close at 8,376.24. The wider Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 25.52 points, or 2.93 percent, to 845.22. The Nasdaq composite index fell 3.14 percent, or 46.82 points, to end at 1,445.56.
 The Treasury's 10-year note rose 1 point, to 110 15/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 2.55 percent, from 2.66 percent late Wednesday. A year ago, the yield was 3.89 percent. 
 Some of the flight to government debt came as investors worried that unemployment data being released Friday would be worse than an anticipated jump to 6.7 or 6.8 percent, analysts said. Those concerns gained ground as AT&T announced it would cut 12,000 jobs, or 4 percent of its work force, to cut costs while consumer spending drops. 
 Fears of rising unemployment and declining consumption have also weighed heavily on oil prices. ''We've been in quite a dramatic downtrend,'' said Tom Bentz, senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas, who expects oil to hit $41.15 a barrel. ''We could achieve that tomorrow, at this rate.''
 After predicting that oil could reach $200 a barrel, analysts are rapidly slashing their forecasts.
 Francisco Blanch, Merrill Lynch commodity strategist, said oil prices could temporarily fall below $30 a barrel next year if the global recession extended to China and oil producers shut down uneconomical production. 
 ''In the short run, global oil-demand growth will likely take a further beating as banks continue to cut credit to consumers and corporations,'' Mr. Blanch wrote. He expects prices to average $50 a barrel next year, down from a previous forecast of $90 a barrel in October.
 The collapse in prices could prompt the OPEC cartel to slash its output when it meets in Algeria in two weeks, according to the group's president, Chakib Khelil. The group, which is struggling to cope with falling prices, in Cairo over the weekend.
 ''We've gone from a fear of inflation to a fear of deflation,'' said William Bellamy, director of fixed income at Thompson Siegel & Walmsley. ''Ultimately that's what's going to be responsible for, I think, driving the 10-year down to 2 percent.''
 Declining oil prices may theoretically help automakers by making prices at the pump cheaper. Still, shares in America's flagging automakers declined as the leaders of General Motors, Chrysler and the Ford Motor Company made a second pilgrimage to Congress to plea for an industrywide bailout.
 Shares of G.M. fell 16 percent, to $4.11, and Ford was off 6.7 percent, to $2.66.
 The slowing economy has also eaten into purchases by consumers headed into the holidays. But shares in major retailers rebounded Thursday despite bleak sales reports for November. Kohl's, Macy's and J. C. Penney all ended the day higher, after they reported that their November sales had fallen by double digits
 Shares of Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, ended higher after it said that sales in November had risen 3.4 percent compared with a year before, beating analysts' estimates. 
 Limited Brands, which operates 3,030 stores and owns Victoria's Secret and Bath and Body Works, reported that its sales at stores open at least a year fell 12 percent last month compared with November 2007. It finished slightly lower.

HEADLINE: Starbucks Issues a Warning on Profit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Starbucks warned Wall Street on Thursday that its profit would fall short of analysts' expectations this quarter, just hours after the chief executive, Howard Schultz, tried to assuage concerns about the recession's effect on the retailer's sales and profit. 
 The chief financial officer, Troy Alstead, said that same-store sales deteriorated by 9 percent in the United States since the company's fiscal first quarter began at the end of September. In its fiscal fourth quarter, the company reported a decline of 8 percent in the United States -- a drop that many investors had hoped would be the company's steepest.
 Sales have been particularly dismal in those states hardest hit by foreclosures, most notably in California and Florida, which make up about 30 percent of the company's store base.
 The comments came during an analyst conference that began with Mr. Schultz trying to curb anxiety on Wall Street about the chain's sliding sales and profit.
 He said he had confidence that ''when, not if, this environment does get better that Starbucks is going to be a stronger company for having gone through it.''

HEADLINE: Trump Sees Act of God In Recession

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
Guess who is complaining that condominiums in Donald Trump's latest big project are ridiculously overpriced.
 Donald Trump is.
 But he isn't cutting the prices. He says the banks won't let him.
 The project is the Trump International Hotel and Tower in Chicago, which is to be the second-tallest building in that city (after the Sears Tower). By Mr. Trump's account, sales were going great until ''the real estate market in Chicago suffered a severe downturn'' and the bankers made it worse by ''creating the current financial crisis.''
 Those assertions are made in a fascinating lawsuit filed by Mr. Trump, the real estate developer, television personality and best-selling author, in an effort to avoid paying $40 million that he personally guaranteed on a construction loan that Deutsche Bank says is due and payable. 
 Rather than have to pay the $40 million, Mr. Trump thinks the bank should pay him $3 billion for undermining the project and damaging his reputation. 
 He points to a ''force majeure'' clause in the lending agreement that allows the borrower to delay completion of the building if construction is hampered by such things as riots, floods or strikes. That clause has a catch-all section covering ''any other event or circumstance not within the reasonable control of the borrower,'' and Mr. Trump figures that lets him out, even though construction is continuing.
 ''Would you consider the biggest depression we have had in this country since 1929 to be such an event? I would,'' he said in an interview. ''A depression is not within the control of the borrower.''
 He wants a state judge in the Queens borough of New York to order the bank to delay efforts to collect the loan until ''a reasonable time'' after the financial crisis ends.
 Deutsche Bank thinks the idea that an economic downturn should free people from the obligation to pay their debts is laughable.
 Mr. Trump, it may be noted, does not think remorseful condominium buyers are in a similar position. When I asked him if he would let them walk away from contracts to buy apartments at predepression prices, he said he would not. ''They don't have a force majeure clause,'' he said.
 The suit, and a parallel one by Deutsche Bank seeking the money, provide a glimpse into both how Mr. Trump does business and into the way the real estate loan market was operating in 2005, when the loan was made.
 For this big project, built on the site of the old Chicago Sun-Times building, it appears from the court papers that Mr. Trump put in little of his own money. He got a construction loan for up to $640 million from a syndicate headed by Deutsche Bank and a $130 million junior loan from another syndicate headed by Fortress Investments, a hedge fund operator that has troubles stemming in part from bad loans made for other real estate projects.
 The people who negotiated the construction loan did not think real estate prices could tumble. The loan agreement requires partial repayment each time an apartment is sold and provides a detailed list of the minimum prices to be charged.
 According to Mr. Trump's suit, he cannot cut prices without the unanimous consent of the lenders, and that has not been forthcoming. There are a lot of lenders in the deal, and some of them appear to be banks and hedge funds that are no longer in good shape.
 The loan was due Nov. 7, and the lenders did not grant a requested extension. Mr. Trump filed his lawsuit just before that deadline.
 Mr. Trump sees a dark conspiracy. He says Deutsche Bank, through a subsidiary, owns $30 million of the junior loan, and he says that is a blatant conflict of interest because in some cases the interests of the two loans can differ. To Mr. Trump, the bank's actions suggest it is trying to seize the building just before its great success is assured. 
 The bank responds that the loan agreement makes clear that it has a right to do everything it has done, and that Mr. Trump should live up to his obligations, paying $40 million of the $334 million outstanding balance on the construction loan. The rest is owed by the Trump-controlled company sponsoring the project but is not personally guaranteed by him. 
 If Mr. Trump was forced to pay the $40 million, he would be unlikely to permanently lose it, since his company would owe it to him. If the project went under, his claim would rank higher than the Fortress loan. Deutsche will make nothing from its investment in the junior loan if Mr. Trump does lose any money.
 Some sort of settlement seems wise. It is in everyone's interest that construction be completed, and in fact the bank advanced $13 million to pay contractors' bills this week.
 Mr. Trump has not said by how much he thinks the apartments are overpriced, and he did not tell me. But it seems unlikely that sales will be very good until prices are cut.
 In his suit, Mr. Trump claims that the bank's ''predatory lending practices'' are harming his reputation, ''which is associated worldwide with on-time, under-budget, first-class construction projects and first-class luxury hotel operations.''
 The bank seized on the opportunity to discuss Mr. Trump's reputation. ''Trump is no stranger to overdue debt,'' it said in asking that his suit be thrown out of court. It noted that Mr. Trump's casino operations have filed for bankruptcy twice, adding, ''This suit is classic Trump.''
 The bank did not discuss why that history did not dissuade it from making the loan. One explanation might be that the fees it got for arranging the loan more than offset the risk from the small part of the loan it kept on its own books.
 Mr. Trump is vigilant in protecting his reputation. After I interviewed him and two associates, his general counsel sent me a note saying ''it was a pleasure'' talking to me, and adding: ''Please be assured that if your article is not factually correct, we will have no choice but to sue you and The New York Times.''
 The Friday after Thanksgiving was not a really good one for Mr. Trump. Trump Entertainment Resorts, the casino company, announced it would miss an interest payment on its bonds, raising the likelihood of a third bankruptcy. Most of the shares are publicly owned, having been distributed to creditors in the last bankruptcy. They have fallen from a peak of $23.80 two years ago to 24 cents on Thursday.
 Mr. Trump is doing his best to sound like that is not important to him. The casino company's announcement emphasized that Mr. Trump was the ''nonexecutive chairman'' who was ''not involved in the daily operations'' of the company. He told me that ''less than 1 percent of my net worth'' is in the casino company.
 At the current price, no shareholder could have a large net worth in that stock.
 On the same day, in New York, Deutsche Bank asked a judge to issue a summary judgment requiring Mr. Trump to pay the $40 million.
 In that filing, the bank quoted from a best-selling book Mr. Trump wrote last year, ''Think Big and Kick Ass in Business and Life.'' In it, the developer said he loved ''to crush the other side and take the benefits'' and mocked the banks that had lost money on loans made to him before another real estate downturn, in the 1990s:
 ''I figured it was the bank's problem, not mine. What the hell did I care? I actually told one bank, 'I told you you shouldn't have loaned me that money. I told you the goddamn deal was no good.' ''
 If Mr. Trump manages to persuade a judge that the current crisis provides him with a good reason not to meet his obligations, he will have some great tales to tell in his next book.

HEADLINE: Bernanke Calls for More Help for Homeowners

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board chairman said Thursday that the government and banks must do more to curb a flood of foreclosures that has devastated families and neighborhoods and now threatens to deepen the housing crisis. 
 The Fed chief, Ben S. Bernanke, said the government had made serious attempts to address the housing crisis and ease the rates of foreclosures. But Mr. Bernanke said some of those programs had so far been sparsely used, and might need bolstering.
 ''Despite good-faith efforts by both the private and public sectors, the foreclosure rate remains too high, with adverse consequences for both those directly involved and for the broader economy,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech in Washington. ''More needs to be done.''
 He sketched out a range of options, including buying delinquent mortgages in bulk and refinancing them into government-backed programs, writing down the value of a loan's principal amount in ''cases of badly underwater mortgages,'' to reflect the decay in real estate values, and bolstering a program run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that seeks to lower homeowners' monthly payments on delinquent mortgages.
 To stoke that program, Mr. Bernanke said, the government could share losses with the lender if a borrower defaulted anew, and could pay $1,000 for every loan modification. He said the government and lender could also split the costs of reducing a household's mortgage payments to a certain portion of household income. ''This approach would increase the incentive of servicers to be aggressive in reducing monthly payments, which would improve the prospects for sustainability,'' he said.
 Mr. Bernanke also said the government could strengthen the Hope for Homeowners program, which lets lenders refinance underwater loans into government-insured, fixed-rate mortgages if they write down the initial amount. Few people have taken part in the program so far, and Mr. Bernanke said it could get a kick-start by lowering mortgage rates from their current 8 percent, or reducing a 3 percent insurance premium lenders must pay.
 ''Steps that stabilize the housing market will help stabilize the economy as well,'' he said. ''Reducing the number of preventable foreclosures would not only help families stay in their homes, it would confer much wider benefits.''
 Foreclosure rates have surged to record levels as the housing boom fell apart and the broader economy stumbled into a recession. As housing values plunged from their frothy highs in 2005 and 2006, families found themselves struggling to pay off mortgages that were worth more than the value of their homes.
 In his remarks, made to the Federal Reserve System's Conference on Housing and Mortgage Markets, Mr. Bernanke said that foreclosures were expected to reach 2.25 million this year, compared with 1 million in normal years.
 He called for measures that would modify home loans, allowing homeowners who are struggling to pay off mortgages to stay in their houses.
 ''Under the current circumstances, with house prices declining and credit tight, permanent loan modifications will often be needed to create sustainable mortgages and keep people in their homes,'' Mr. Bernanke said. 
 The Mortgage Bankers Association is to release data on third-quarter foreclosure rates and delinquency rates Friday morning.

HEADLINE: Issues Pressing, Obama Fills Top Posts at a Sprint

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and HELENE COOPER; Peter Baker reported from Chicago, and Helene Cooper from Washington. Jackie Calmes contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
The call summoning him was somewhat cryptic. Only after Gen. James L. Jones showed up in a hotel suite for a one-on-one meeting with Barack Obama did it become clear what was going on.
 Would General Jones be interested in a senior national security job? Mr. Obama asked. General Jones said he would be.
 That was Oct. 22, a full 13 days before the election. This week, the two appeared together here as the president-elect announced that he was appointing General Jones as his national security adviser. 
 Mr. Obama is moving more quickly to fill his administration's top ranks than any newly elected president in modern times. He has named virtually the entire top echelon of his White House staff and nearly half of his cabinet. Just a month after his election, Mr. Obama has announced his selections for 13 of the 24 most important positions in a new administration.
 By comparison, Bill Clinton had filled only one of those jobs by this point in his transition, and Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan only two. Even the elder George Bush, who had the advantage of succeeding a fellow Republican, had picked just eight a month after his election. George W. Bush, stalled by the Florida recount, had named a chief of staff at this point in 2000 but was waiting to find out if he would even become president.
 Mr. Obama's advisers are acutely aware that moving too quickly can cause mistakes. But accounts of the process emerging from participants suggest that the president-elect is trying to be decisive as well as methodical and secretive in filling out his administration, perhaps foreshadowing how he intends to run the government. 
 ''You don't have time to waste,'' said Rahm Emanuel, the incoming White House chief of staff, who was named to his post two days after the election. ''This is the worst economic situation since the Great Depression and the largest commitment of troops overseas since Richard Nixon. That's the world we're inheriting, and the president-elect said we don't have a moment to waste putting things together.''
 Aides said Mr. Obama had been determined to expedite the cumbersome selection and vetting cycle that had bogged down previous transitions, in the hope that Senate confirmation of top nominees would be accelerated. They said he had been particularly committed to avoid what happened in 2001, when many top national security positions were still unfilled at the time of the Sept. 11 attacks. 
 So far, none of Mr. Obama's appointees have run into serious controversies, although questions are being raised about the involvement of Eric H. Holder Jr., the choice for attorney general, in Mr. Clinton's last-minute pardon of Marc Rich, the fugitive financier. In other cases, Mr. Obama avoided difficulty by passing over early front-runners, among them John O. Brennan, a candidate for director of the Central Intelligence Agency, who could have run into trouble.
 ''If you make a mistake, it has more resonance in the early period than it does later on,'' said Martha Joynt Kumar, the director of the White House Transition Project, a scholarly effort.
 According to transition officials, Mr. Obama set the process in motion in August by recruiting John D. Podesta, Mr. Clinton's former chief of staff, to lead his transition. Mr. Obama began to meet secretly with potential candidates before Election Day, transition officials said, though it is not clear exactly when that process began. 
 Advisers contacted General Jones and asked him to catch up with Mr. Obama on the campaign trail. General Jones, who had spoken with Mr. Obama only twice before, rode by car one day from Washington to Richmond, Va., for the meeting.
 No promises were made that morning, but it touched off a series of telephone calls about possible jobs and issues like the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. ''We did a walk around the world a couple of times,'' General Jones said in an interview. Shortly after the election, he was asked to come to Chicago, where he met again with Mr. Obama and talked about becoming secretary of state or national security adviser, people close to the transition said.
 Likewise, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton was not sure what Mr. Obama wanted to talk about when she was summoned here last month, said another person close to the transition. She had heard speculation about jobs, but only after she arrived at Mr. Obama's office did he ask her to think about being secretary of state.
 Only a handful of advisers are intimately involved as Mr. Obama makes his selections, including Mr. Emanuel; Mr. Podesta; Valerie Jarrett, his longtime adviser; Pete Rouse, his chief of staff in the Senate; and Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., aides said.
 Mr. Obama has personally interviewed all of his senior appointees and has sometimes met with more than one candidate before deciding, aides said. At one point, he was set to make Peter R. Orszag, the Congressional budget director, his White House budget director without a meeting because they had worked together. But Mr. Orszag was brought to Chicago anyway.
 The interviews played a critical role in settling on a Treasury secretary. Although Mr. Obama knew former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, he did not really know the other main candidate, Timothy F. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. After meeting with him, Mr. Obama told some people he felt temperamentally in sync with Mr. Geithner, who is the same age as Mr. Obama, 47, and shares a certain low-key wonkish quality. 
 But Mr. Obama saw Mr. Summers as a brilliant economist adept at distilling complex issues, despite past controversial statements that might have caused confirmation problems. So Mr. Obama persuaded him to head the White House National Economic Council, an appointment that does not require Senate approval.
 ''I think he fell in love with Tim,'' said someone familiar with the meeting. ''But he also felt he needed to have Larry.''
 In trying to put his team together rapidly, Mr. Obama is fighting history. It took a little more than two months after inauguration on average for John F. Kennedy's nominees to be confirmed by the Senate, according to data compiled by Paul Light, a professor at New York University. By Mr. Reagan's presidency, it took twice that long. President Bush's appointees on average took nine months.
 New legislation and extensive efforts by the Bush administration are helping to speed that up. Clay Johnson III, a Bush aide coordinating with the Obama team, called the president-elect's selection process ''well organized and staffed'' and said he was on track to put his senior team ''on the field faster than any incoming president in recent history.''

HEADLINE: Is Chrysler Simply Looking for a Mate? That's the Take of a Tennessee Senator

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Congressional hearings on the fate of Detroit's auto companies have focused most intensely on General Motors, which, as the largest of the Big Three, will send the most damaging shock waves through the economy if it is not rescued. 
 But on Thursday, Chrysler took its turn under a harsh spotlight, when one Republican senator raised questions about whether privately owned Chrysler should even be considered for government assistance along with General Motors and the Ford Motor Company. 
 Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, in a testy exchange with Chrysler's chairman, Robert L. Nardelli, said that the company's parent, Cerberus Capital Management, was more interested in finding a merger partner than building a viable automaker for the long term.
 ''Chrysler doesn't really want to be a stand-alone business and that's well documented,'' Mr. Corker said. ''You want to hang around long enough so you can date some day and hope to get married soon before you run out of money.''
 The accusations appeared to sting Mr. Nardelli, who was named Chrysler's chairman last year after Cerberus acquired the company for $7.4 billion from the German automaker Daimler.
 ''I can assure you, senator, that I don't wake up every morning thinking of selling the company,'' he said.
 Chrysler has consistently said that it is looking for alliances or partnerships with other automakers to defray the costs of developing new vehicles and expanding into international markets. At the same time, Chrysler has been cutting deeply into its operations.
 Since Cerberus bought it, Chrysler has eliminated 32,000 jobs, including thousands of salaried workers who accepted buyouts on the day before Thanksgiving.
 Mr. Corker said he had spoken recently with an unnamed board member of Cerberus, and was told that the private equity firm had no plans to invest any more money in the struggling automaker.
 ''What the board member said is, 'There is no way they will make additional investments in an automobile company at this time,' '' he said. ''There is not a human being alive in the automobile world who thinks that Chrysler is doing anything other than hanging around long enough until it finds somebody to marry.''
 It was a harsh assessment of the efforts by Mr. Nardelli, who has been trying to keep Chrysler afloat while its sales have sunk more than any other major automaker this year. In November alone, Chrysler's sales plummeted 47 percent.
 In a sense, it was Chrysler's merger talks this fall with G.M. that helped draw more attention to the faltering fortunes of the Detroit companies. 
 During the merger discussions, G.M.'s chairman, Rick Wagoner, first traveled to Washington to seek assistance from the Treasury Department to help finance the deal, which the company said at the time would help them both get through the steep downturn.
 But Mr. Wagoner was turned away when federal officials realized that the merger would result in the loss of thousands of jobs at the combined companies.
 Shortly afterward, G.M. revealed that it was rapidly running out of cash to fund its operations and needed federal loans to survive.
 Chrysler then said it, too, was perilously close to exhausting its cash hoard, and needed $7 billion in government assistance.
 Another member of the Senate Banking Committee, Robert Bennett of Utah, said Thursday that he thought a G.M.-Chrysler merger was a good idea. 
 ''Everything I have seen is that a merger between General Motors and Chrysler is a good thing,'' Mr. Bennett said. ''It's not a shotgun wedding. It's a marriage that makes sense.''
 Mr. Wagoner said at the hearing that given G.M.'s dire financial condition, any discussion of a merger has been set aside indefinitely.
 But that did not stop Mr. Corker from criticizing Chrysler for piggybacking on the loan requests of G.M. and Ford, which is the healthiest of the Detroit companies.
 Mr. Nardelli, who was formerly the head of the retailer Home Depot, tried gamely to explain that Chrysler was building alliances with foreign automakers like Volkswagen and Nissan as part of a business model to survive -- not as a prelude to selling off the company.
 But that did not deter Mr. Corker, who stretched his marriage analogy to describe Chrysler as a woman trying to become more attractive in hopes of wooing a suitor.
 ''While this is happening you're going to be going to spas and getting facials and trying to get someone to marry you,'' he said.
 That drew a sharp response from Mr. Nardelli. ''I've been married for 38 years,'' he said.
 At that point, Mr. Corker, let the metaphor die. ''I was talking about your company,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Intentions and Opposite Results in Iraq

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES 
 How War in Iraq Strengthened America's Enemies 
 By Peter W. Galbraith 
 203 pages. Simon & Schuster. $23. 
 In his compelling new book the scholar and former diplomat Peter W. Galbraith not only reminds us that the Iraq war has been a costly, bungled operation, but he also argues that the war has had the opposite effect of virtually everything that President Bush and his administration promised the American public it would have: 
 A war intended to eliminate (what were later found to be non-existent) weapons of mass destruction in Iraq ''ended up with Iran and North Korea much closer to having deployable nuclear weapons.'' 
 A war intended to help combat terrorism has led to the recruitment of more terrorists and the spread of Al Qaeda to Iraq. 
 A war intended to create a bulwark against the ayatollahs in Tehran turned into a ''strategic gift to Iran'' and the empowerment in Iraq of pro-Iranian Shiite theocrats.
 A war intended to make Israel more secure has made that country more vulnerable to threats from Syria, Iran and Hezbollah. 
 A war intended to showcase American power has ended up underscoring ''the deficiencies of U.S. intelligence, the incompetence of American administration and the limitations on the American military.'' 
 A war meant to boost America's global leadership ''has driven U.S. prestige to an all-time low'' over the last five years and alienated important allies like Turkey.
 Mr. Galbraith makes a persuasive case for these arguments, using his firsthand observations on the ground in Iraq (as a staff member for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and later as a consultant for ABC News) and his extensive knowledge of the region to explicate the consequences that the American invasion has had on political and ethnic struggles within Iraq and on larger strategic alignments in the Middle East and wider world.
 Certainly many readers will not agree with all his theories. He perversely contends, for instance, that the Iraqi exile and neoconservative favorite Ahmad Chalabi might have done ''a respectable job running Iraq,'' since he was capable enough to help persuade the United States to get rid of his nemesis, Saddam Hussein, ''when Iraq posed no threat to the United States.'' But, all in all, ''Unintended Consequences'' offers a lucid, pointed and often powerful deconstruction of the Bush administration's blunders in prosecuting the war.
 As Mr. Galbraith sees it, critics of the war are wrong to focus on matters like the dismissal of the Iraqi Army or the draconian de-Baathification decree, issued by L. Paul Bremer III, because such missteps, important as they are, obscure ''the larger failure that was the product of incompetence, partisanship and an obsession with ideology over pragmatism.'' The root of the problem, he says, was ''the absence of presidential decision making'': ''The self-styled decider never decided the most critical questions about the future of Iraq'' -- like how to provide security in Baghdad when American forces took it over or how a post-Hussein Iraq would be governed -- ''and worse, never knew there were critical matters that needed deciding.'' 
 Two things, Mr. Galbraith contends, ''ensured defeat in the days that followed the U.S. takeover of Iraq'' -- namely the American failure to stop the looting of Baghdad, which ''continued unchecked for at least six weeks'' and ''the decision, made three weeks after U.S. troops were already in Baghdad, to substitute an occupation government for an Iraqi government, and then to put together the occupation government in a slapdash manner with an unqualified American administrator at its head and a staff filled with unqualified Republican Party loyalists.'' While readers interested in a detailed chronicle of the incompetence of the Coalition Provisional Authority would do better to read Rajiv Chandrasekaran's revealing 2006 book ''Imperial Life in the Emerald City'' or Larry Diamond's 2005 account ''Squandered Victory,'' those who simply want to cut to the chase will find Mr. Galbraith's analysis of the authority under Mr. Bremer both devastating and succinct. 
 ''Bremer's occupation government lasted 14 months and accomplished almost nothing,'' he writes. ''Under Bremer's watch, oil and electricity production plummeted. Unemployment rose sharply, and security deteriorated. Bremer did issue a lot of decrees -- 100 in total. Some were pet conservative projects -- a 15 percent flat income tax in a country where no one paid taxes -- while others dealt with more practical issues such as control of borders. Some were part of a larger scheme to revamp Iraqi society by privatizing basic industries and creating new institutions. Almost none had any practical effect.'' 
 When it comes to assessing Iraq's future, Mr. Galbraith is deeply pessimistic, discounting what others have seen as more hopeful signs. He argues that President Bush ''has already surrendered Iraq to Iran and to the same undemocratic forces that we invaded Iraq to remove'': ''Iran's allies dominate Iraq's central government. Iraq is divided along ethnic lines into Arab and Kurdish states and there are civil wars being fought between Sunnis and Shiites in the Arab parts. The United States has no chance of achieving what President Bush has defined as victory: a self-sustaining, democratic and unified Iraq.'' 
 And what of the surge? As Mr. Galbraith sees it, the surge and the Sunni Awakening have helped defeat al Qaeda in Anbar, Salahadin and west Baghdad but have also undermined Iraq's unity by establishing a Sunni militia; and the Awakening, which is composed of Baathists, many of whom were part of the anti-American insurgency, could easily turn against the United States again or against the Iraqi government, particularly if America stops providing funds to it. In addition, Mr. Galbraith says, the Mahdi army -- Moqtada al-Sadr's Shiite militia, which has temporarily stood down -- remains a potent force, and ''there is every reason to suppose that, once the U.S. troops leave, the Mahdi army will retake neighborhoods and resume its campaign of terror aimed at driving Sunnis from Baghdad.'' If so ''the surge will have bought a respite in Baghdad's violence but not the end.'' 
 The ''pretense that the surge is a success and that therefore the United States is winning the Iraq War,'' Mr. Galbraith contends, ''is the opening salvo in a coming blame game as to who lost Iraq.'' He suggests that the surge has enabled President Bush to ''run out the clock on his term in office so as to avoid having to admit defeat'' and that running out the clock serves the interests of the Republican Party, setting up a G.O.P. story line for 2009: ''When George W. Bush left office, America was winning the Iraq War. His successor -- abetted by the Democratic Congress and the faithless American people -- squandered the victory and is responsible for the consequences.''

HEADLINE: Jobs Slashed at Viacom And NBC Universal

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO and BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
The downturn in the media industry got even deeper Thursday, as more than 1,300 people who work at Viacom and NBC Universal lost their jobs.
 Viacom, the big media company controlled by Sumner M. Redstone, said Thursday that it would cut nearly 7 percent of its work force, or 850 workers, and freeze salaries for its top managers. NBC Universal, meanwhile, said it was laying off 500 employees, including several longtime correspondents for NBC News.
 Viacom's cuts are intended to save $200 million to $250 million in 2009. The cuts at NBC are a result of the company's plan, announced in October, to shave $500 million, or roughly 3 percent, from the budget in 2009. 
 ''This kind of message is never easy, but it is the right step to make, and the right time to make it,'' Jeffrey A. Zucker, chief executive of NBC Universal, wrote in a memo in October. ''We have no choice but to respond quickly to the external economic forces that are affecting the entire world economy.''
 The cuts at Viacom and NBC Universal, which is owned by General Electric, are part of a swirl of cost reductions across the media industry, from magazines to newspapers to television, amid both the economic downturn and more fundamental shifts, as advertising flows from traditional media to the Internet. 
 Executives at the Walt Disney Company, News Corporation and CBS have all said they are eyeing cost savings. 
 Most employees who are losing their jobs at Viacom, which includes MTV, VH1 and the Paramount movie studio, were notified Thursday and will be paid for the rest of the year before severance payments begin, a Viacom spokesman said.
 At NBC News, the cuts included Mark Mullen, who served as the Beijing bureau chief during the Summer Olympics; John Larson, the West Coast correspondent for ''Dateline NBC''; and the Dallas-based correspondent Don Teague.
 At Universal Pictures, the chairman, Marc Shmuger, and the co-chairman, David Linde, wrote in a memo sent Thursday that the head count would be reduced by about 3 percent. Additionally, the studios would be ''scaling back on travel, overtime, consultants, premieres, conferences, newspaper marketing and general administrative costs.'' 
 Viacom said it would take a pretax charge of $400 million to $450 million to its fourth-quarter earnings.
 Philippe P. Dauman, Viacom's chief executive, said in a statement on Thursday: ''The changes we are making in our organization and process will better position Viacom to navigate the economic slowdown and generate sizable efficiencies that will help us to drive our businesses as the marketplace stabilizes and conditions improve.''
 Mr. Dauman and Thomas E. Dooley, the chief financial officer, are among the more than 1,000 senior managers who will not receive a salary increase in 2009. But they could still receive a bonus, which has been a larger part of their compensation. In 2007, Mr. Dauman received a salary of $2 million, which was raised to $2.5 million this year. His bonus last year was $7 million, and his target bonus for 2008, according to a regulatory filing, is $9.5 million. 
 Mr. Dooley, who is also among the handful of executives whose salaries are disclosed, received $1.6 million in salary in 2007, which was raised to $2 million in 2008. His bonus last year was $5.6 million, and his target bonus for 2008 is $7.6 million.
 In a research note about Viacom published Thursday, Michael Nathanson, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said ''the near-term advertising environment is fraught with risk in this weak macroeconomic environment and the company has repeatedly proven in the past six months that it has relatively little visibility into near-term advertising trends.''
 The cuts at NBC extended to CNBC, the business news network, which will cut several dozen positions. The network confirmed Thursday that ''The Big Idea with Donny Deutsch,'' hosted by the advertising executive, will be placed on hiatus. The program has struggled to find an audience for the last four years. Mr. Deutsch will remain at CNBC, where he will produce monthly specials and appear on CNBC and NBC programs, a spokesman said.
 In a move that was not related to Thursday's cuts, CNBC's vice president for long-form programming, Josh Howard, told employees on Wednesday that he was leaving. ''Producing quality long-form programming is an expensive undertaking, and in this economic environment not all news organizations can continue to afford to do it,'' Mr. Howard, who decided not to renew his contract when it expires this month, said in an e-mail message to staff members.

HEADLINE: Economy Is Subject As Putin Is Peppered

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin spent much of his annual question-and-answer televised exchange on Thursday seeking to reassure Russians that the effects of the global economic crisis on the country would be minimal. He also denied increased speculation that he might seek an early return to the presidency.
In a three-hour broadcast, Mr. Putin faced a barrage of questions from people across the country concerned about the decline in the value of the ruble, increased fuel costs, unpaid pensions and rising unemployment, among other issues. 
When Mr. Putin started the annual broadcast as president seven years ago, the mood was different. Russia was at the start of a decade-long economic boom. The standard of living reached historic heights and Mr. Putin enjoyed huge popularity. With the onset of more difficult times, however, it is unclear how long either can be maintained.
At the beginning of the broadcast, Mr. Putin deflected responsibility for his country's economic woes, placing blame, as he has done before, squarely on what he called American recklessness.
''The crisis began in the United States, whose financial and economic policies led to the crisis that infected the economies of practically all major countries of the world,'' he said.
In a sign, however, that Russia might be ready to put past antipathy aside to cooperate with the incoming Obama administration, he pulled back from the harsh criticism of the United States that has peppered his similar performances.
''We are really counting on this being a positive change,'' he said, adding that ''positive signals'' had been coming from President-elect Barack Obama and his team. ''If these are not simply words, if they are transformed into practical policies, then, of course, our reaction will be adequate, and our American partners will immediately notice this.''
Mr. Putin was less accommodating of Ukraine and Georgia, two former Soviet republics that have become staunch foes of Moscow.
He praised NATO's decision this week to put off granting Ukraine and Georgia a concrete time frame for joining the alliance.
He said Russia would continue to insist that Ukraine pay back some $2.4 billion in debt on Russian natural gas shipments, and did not rule out a cut in supply if Ukraine failed to comply.
And Mr. Putin again blamed Georgia for starting the war with Russia in August. He said Georgia's leaders were responsible for effectively losing two Georgian separatist enclaves, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, at the heart of the Russia-Georgia conflict.
Most of the 70 or so questions Mr. Putin answered during the call-in program focused on domestic issues, and the prime minister spent much of the time trying to remain positive on the country's flagging economy.
''We have a very good chance of passing through this difficult period, I repeat, a difficult period, but one with minimal costs for the economy, and, most importantly, for our people,'' he said.
Mr. Putin said pensions would grow by 34 percent next year, and made guarantees that salaries and other benefits would remain stable. He also said the government would move forward with plans to reform education, health care and housing.
Still, Russia has been hit hard by the economic crisis, particularly because of plummeting oil prices. The country relies heavily on revenue from energy resources, and Mr. Putin has been criticized for a failure to adopt policies that would have allowed for economic diversification.
The worry was palpable in the questions submitted to Mr. Putin, a fraction of more than two million sent in via the Internet, telephone, text message and live video feed.
The first question came from a metals worker who recently lost his job. The worker, from a village in central Russia, worried about how he and others like him would support their families.
Mr. Putin vowed to increase unemployment benefits, and said he was working with regional governments on a number of measures to try ''to save jobs where it is possible to do so.''
''I still hope that we won't have mass unemployment, but the number of people temporarily losing their jobs will definitely rise,'' Mr. Putin said later in the broadcast.
The broadcast was Mr. Putin's first as prime minister, and his decision to preside over it, rather than defer to the current president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, had fueled already buzzing speculation that he might seek to return to his old post before the current presidential term expires in 2012.
In a news conference later on Thursday, Mr. Putin denied that early presidential elections would be held, but did not rule out possibly running for president after Mr. Medvedev's term is up, according to the Itar-Tass news agency. ''The next elections of the Russian Federation are in 2012,'' he said, according to the Russian government Web site. ''We will live until that time and see what happens.''

HEADLINE: AUTO EXECUTIVES FACE A HARD SELL ON CAPITAL HILL

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and BILL VLASIC; Bill Vlasic contributed reporting from Washington and Nick Bunkley from Detroit.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The chief executives of America's foundering automobile manufacturers returned to Capitol Hill on Thursday and found themselves confronting years of pent-up anger, the harsh politics of a recession and the realization that even their strongest supporters might not be able to muster the votes to save them. 
 Fiscal hawks are worried that taxpayers will lose billions. Pro-labor lawmakers are furious that union workers are being blamed for causing the automakers' problems, even as tens of thousands face layoffs. Environmentalists like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are fed up after years of battles over fuel-efficiency rules. And Congress, as a whole, is suffering from acute bailout fatigue. 
 ''I don't want to raise expectations that that is going to be easy at all given the climate in the country,'' Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said after Thursday's hearing before the banking committee, which he leads. ''That's a tall order.'' 
 In a sign of the growing pessimism among the Democratic leadership, Mr. Dodd; Ms. Pelosi; Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee; and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, wrote to President Bush after Thursday's hearing urging him to rescue the auto industry. 
 Mr. Dodd supports a taxpayer rescue but called on the Bush administration or the Federal Reserve to save the automakers because Congress might not do so. Mr. Dodd said that he would persist in trying to reach a legislative agreement, even as it continued to be clear that Democrats in Congress, furious over how the administration has handled the $700 billion bailout of the country's financial system, were reluctant to put more taxpayer money on the line. 
 There were almost as many reasons as there were lawmakers. Republican fiscal hawks, like Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, suggested that the companies might be doomed after years of trailing their foreign competitors and might not be worthy of taxpayer expense. 
 Mr. Corker, whose state is home to Nissan's North American headquarters, also asked why taxpayers should give Chrysler money when Cerberus, the private equity firm that owns 80 percent of Chrysler, was unwilling to invest any more of its own cash. 
 Confirming fears that taxpayers could lose out, the economist Mark Zandi, of Moody'sEconomy.com, said that automakers probably needed much more than their requested $34 billion and perhaps as much as $125 billion. He predicted that the automakers would ask for more money by next fall. 
 Even among lawmakers who have supported government interventions in the past, bailout fatigue is now gripping much of Capitol Hill. Mr. Dodd and Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said they favored helping the automakers but only with strict oversight by a board or special trustee, perhaps a Cabinet secretary, to be sure the companies used the money as intended. 
 But that proposal would require writing and passing complicated new legislation that could be difficult to achieve, given the tight calendar. 
 Senator Richard C. Shelby, the senior Republican on the panel, whose home state, Alabama, has sizable Toyota and Honda operations, has consistently voted against government interventions in private industry, including the Chrysler bailout in the 1970s and the recent rescue. But his criticism of Detroit was merciless. ''The firms continue to trail their major competitors in almost every category necessary to compete,'' he said. 
 Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania, and other pro-labor lawmakers, said they resented that the United Automobile Workers union was being blamed for causing the automakers' financial problems. ''There wasn't much discussion about the upcoming sacrifice and concessions that labor is making, and I was trying to point out some of the previous concessions they have made,'' Mr. Casey said. ''They are substantial.'' 
 The White House said it stood ready to aid the auto industry by speeding up access to $25 billion in loans approved as part of a 2007 energy bill, an idea Ms. Pelosi has resisted, and accused the Democrats of trying to pass the buck after failing to win support for their own plan. ''They can't get Congressional support for their idea,'' said Tony Fratto, the deputy White House press secretary. ''So they want us to do it instead.'' 
 After being sent home to Detroit empty-handed two weeks ago, the chief executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler made a show of contrition: driving to the Capitol in some of their most fuel-efficient vehicles to deliver the detailed reorganization plans that Congressional leaders had said were lacking last time. But within moments of the opening gavel it was clear that even a flawless presentation might not be enough. 
 Mr. Shelby grilled the executives about how they got to Washington, suggesting he regarded driving as a stunt. ''Did you drive or did you have a driver? Did you drive a little and ride a little? And secondly, I guess are you going to drive back?'' 
 That prompted Mr. Dodd, laughing, to interject: ''Where did you stay? What did you eat?'' 
 ''The chairman wants to make light of this,'' Mr. Shelby said. He was not smiling. And he got his answers. It was hardly the only uncomfortable moment for the executives, Rick Wagoner of G.M, Alan R. Mulally of Ford, and Robert L. Nardelli of Chrysler.
 G.M., in particular, is in dire straits with some predicting that the company might be forced into bankruptcy. From the start, the executives took an apologetic tone in making their cases for the government-financed bailout: G.M. asked for $12 billion in loans and a $6 billion line of credit; Ford for a $9 billion line of credit that it can draw on if needed; and Chrysler for an immediate $7 billion loan.
 ''We're here today because we made mistakes, which we are learning from, and because some forces beyond our control have pushed us to the brink,'' said Mr. Wagoner. ''Most importantly, we're here because saving General Motors, and all this company represents, is a job worth doing.''
 Ford is not seeking loans for now. But its chief executive, Mr. Mulally, echoed the comments of his counterparts at G.M. and Chrysler that an automobile company could not survive a bankruptcy filing.
 ''Any threat of a company going into bankruptcy would really, really hurt sales,'' Mr. Mulally said. ''Sales would fall off so fast that you couldn't restructure fast enough.''
 Much of the questioning from senators zeroed in on whether the companies were simply seeking loans to forestall inevitable failure. But over the course of nearly six hours of questions, some lawmakers belittled or dismissed aspects of the companies' plans. In a reminder that the automakers are seeking help after a long line of banks before them received taxpayer funds, many with few strings attached, a large chart stood just to the side of the dais titled, ''Taxpayer-Funded Bailouts.''
 With large blue bars, it showed $300 billion for Citigroup; $200 billion for the mortgage giants, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac; $150 billion for the insurance conglomerate, American International Group; $29 billion for the failed investment bank, Bear Stearns. 
 At the bottom of the chart were three more blue bars, each with a red question mark after them: $18 billion for General Motors; $13 billion for Ford; $7 billion for Chrysler.
 Perhaps the only consensus at the hearing was that the automakers, particularly G.M., were in grave trouble and that the government might have no good options at this point. Mr. Zandi, of Moody's, said allowing one or more of the companies to fail would be disastrous. ''Bankruptcy at this point in time would be cataclysmic for the economy,'' he said. ''So I think you need to help them now.'' 
 But some conservative lawmakers have called for letting one or more of the Big Three fail. Senator Mike Crapo, Republican of Idaho, repeatedly pressed the question about bankruptcy as an option during Thursday's hearing. 
 Senator Robert Bennett, Republican of Utah, raised a new idea that would call on financial firms receiving assistance under the Treasury's $700 billion program to convert any auto company debt that they hold into equity stakes, easing the cash liquidity problems of the Big Three, and potentially allowing additional infusions of government cash into the financial firms. 
 Mr. Casey said that Congress must act. ''For me, this debate is pretty simple: as complex as the financing, as complex as the challenges are, it's about jobs,'' he said. ''The atmosphere in America today is frankly pretty negative for any kind of assistance,'' he said. ''We have some work to do to get the votes that we need.'' 
 ''Nothing concentrates the mind like a death sentence,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''And we're looking at a death sentence here if we don't respond.''

HEADLINE: 3 European Central Banks Cut Rates

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris, and Bettina Wassener from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: BRUSSELS 

 BODY:
Interest rates fell at a historic pace across the globe Thursday as central banks sliced borrowing costs in a bid to stimulate stagnating economies and revitalize credit markets still idling despite huge government rescue packages.
 The European Central Bank knocked down its benchmark interest rate by three-quarters of a percentage point, to 2.5 percent. The reduction is the largest in the bank's 10-year history, capping a furious end to 2008, a span in which the bank nearly halved its key rate and provided ever-easier credit to ailing banks.
 The magnitude of the bank's efforts has made clear that it is worried about an economic downturn that is becoming broader and deeper by the day. The central bank was mapping out a strategy that is, in word and deed, less drastic than that of the Federal Reserve, at the epicenter of the crisis in the United States, but nonetheless precedent-setting. 
 The bank's rates have not reached their lowest levels ever, but most economists expect they will do so early next year. The central bank president, Jean-Claude Trichet, made clear that the bank was considering that and more.
 ''If new decisions are needed, we will take new decisions,'' Mr. Trichet said after a policy meeting in Brussels, later adding, ''I exclude nothing.''
 The Bank of England did its part as well Thursday, cutting rates by a full percentage point, to 2 percent, the lowest level in 50 years. When it next reduces rates, as most economists expect early next year, it will have brought borrowing costs to their lowest level in the institution's 314-year history.
 The European Central Bank accelerated its rate reductions as new projections from its staff suggested the economy of the 15-nation euro zone would be lucky to emerge from its current contraction in the second half of 2009.
 Inflation, only six months ago a source of angst for the European Central Bank, will undershoot the bank's goal of close to 2 percent in 2009, according to the forecasts.
 ''Price stability is important,'' said Erik Nielsen, chief Europe economist at Goldman Sachs. ''But what they have done over the past two months is huge for them.''
 Across the English Channel, the Bank of England looked close to tossing out the rule book entirely, as it faced an economic crisis led by a free fall in the country's flagship industry, financial services, where sweeping layoffs are underscoring how bad it could get.
 Heavily indebted consumers who are now curbing spending are prompting a sharp rise in British unemployment, and the British central bank now seems ready to deploy its financial firepower unsparingly.
 ''They are pretty much signaling that they will go as low as zero,'' said Jacques Cailloux, chief Europe economist in London at Royal Bank of Scotland. ''They will do anything they can to prevent any sort of vicious spiral through the economy.''
 The Swedish central bank delivered much the same message on Thursday.
 It reduced its key lending rate by 1.75 percentage points, to 2 percent. Earlier in the day, the New Zealand central bank also lowered rates, underscoring the rapidly unfolding global easing of monetary conditions. Indonesia, which had not been expected to move, made a surprise cut Thursday in its main rate, by a quarter-point, to 9.25 percent.
 Mr. Trichet distanced the European Central Bank from the Federal Reserve's policy of ''quantitative easing,'' or pumping cash into the economy to pressure banks to lend.
 ''We are all doing what we trust is appropriate,'' Mr. Trichet said. ''We are not all in the same situation.''
 Instead, what is shaping up in Europe is a policy that combines very low interest rates with less orthodox methods of persuading banks to step up lending to the rest of the economy. For example, the European Central Bank is considering changes to its deposit facility, which many banks are using to hoard their cash.
 The European bank is reluctant to cut rates more quickly and promise to keep them there, as the Fed has effectively done, because it ties the bank's hands in tightening credit later when the crisis has passed. Previous promises of easy money are commonly blamed for creating the housing boom whose collapse is at the core of the current crisis.
 ''The E.C.B. has no intention of inflating its way out of a debt bubble as the Fed is preparing to do,'' said Elga Bartsch, chief Europe economist in London for Morgan Stanley.
 Mr. Trichet also emphasized that central banks could not fight the crisis alone.
 He criticized governments and the European Commission, the executive arm of the 27-member European Union, for not moving quickly enough to put in place the bank recapitalization and guarantee plans that were rushed through legislatures in October.
 European antitrust authorities have come under fire for not approving the programs more quickly, and the central bankers pressured a top commission official at their meeting Thursday to accelerate the process.
 The European Central Bank's reluctance to outline a more forceful strategy for the future exposes it to the charge that it is underestimating the severity of the downturn, and that it is passing on opportunities to get ahead of it, analysts said.
 Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, said the bank was finding the shift difficult ''after years of fighting the old battle'' against inflation, but urged it to act more quickly.
 ''You build up anti-inflation credibility precisely so you can use it in an emergency,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''This is an emergency.''

HEADLINE: Washington's New Tack: Helping Home Buyers

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
After pouring vast amounts of money into financial institutions of almost every type, and having little to show for it, the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve are suddenly taking a new look at ordinary homeowners.
 Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned on Thursday that the soaring number of foreclosures threatened the economy. He then proposed some ideas -- government-engineered loan modifications, and more taxpayer money to help people refinance -- to keep people in their homes.
 ''The public policy case for reducing preventable foreclosures does not rely solely on the desire to help people who are in trouble,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''More needs to be done.''
 At the Treasury Department, meanwhile, top officials continued to work on a plan to bolster the housing market by subsidizing 30-year home mortgages with rates as low as 4.5 percent -- a level that home buyers have not seen since the early 1960s. 
 Both actions highlighted how economic policy makers have come almost full circle. Since the financial crisis began last summer, both the Fed and the Treasury had focused almost exclusively on patching up the financial system -- propping up banks, Wall Street firms, money market funds and issuers of commercial debt. 
 But the new focus on helping individuals could create a bitter split between those who want to buy homes and those who already own them. It has already opened up a rift between the real estate industry, which wants to increase sales, and the banking industry, which wants to get out from under staggering volumes of troubled mortgages. 
 Under a plan that top Treasury officials are weighing, the Treasury Department would underwrite tens of billions of dollars worth of 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages at rates far lower than most Americans have ever seen. 
 According to Bankrate.com, the 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages fell on Thursday to 5.58 percent, down from 5.76 percent last week. The 10-year Treasury note fell to 2.55 percent late Thursday, a new low.
 But the cheap mortgages would be available only for people buying houses, not the roughly 50 million families that already have mortgages and would want to refinance at a lower rate.
 As a result, the plan offers no direct relief to the millions of people who face foreclosure because they took out exotic mortgages that they could not afford. Nor would the plan offer any benefit to people who have stayed current on their mortgages and would simply be interested in taking advantage of a lower rate. As envisioned by Treasury officials, homeowners who now pay 6 percent would be watching new neighbors arrive whose monthly payments were almost one-third lower.
 ''At this point, our view is that such a program may do more harm than good,'' said Camden R. Fine, president of the Independent Community Bankers of America, which represents about 8,000 small banks. 
 ''You have thousands of banks that made loans and have them sitting on their books, and whose borrowers have worked their rear ends off to make the payments,'' he said. ''Those people are going to go to their banks and tell them their neighbor just got a 4.5 percent loan, and the banks aren't going to be able to help them. They're going to have extremely angry and disgruntled customers.''
 But the National Association of Realtors, whose members want to bolster home sales, is lobbying hard for the idea.
 ''We believe that the only way to really address the housing situation is to increase sales,'' said Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the association. ''Home prices will not stabilize until we address the inventory problem, and the only way to bring down the inventory of houses on the market is to bring in a new set of buyers. We think this would do the trick.''
 Mr. Yun estimated that a one-year program to provide home buyers with an interest rate of 4.5 percent would cost the government about $50 billion. It would result, he predicted, in about 500,000 home sales -- an increase of slightly more than 10 percent over today's depressed sales rate. If the program were extended to people who simply wanted to refinance, Mr. Yun warned, the government's cost could easily be 10 times higher.
 Neel T. Kashkari, the assistant Treasury secretary who is overseeing the $700 billion bailout plan, publicly confirmed on Thursday that the mortgage plan was under consideration but offered no other details.
 People familiar with the discussions said Treasury officials were still debating the exact mechanism for financing the cheap mortgages. The main idea is to allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled mortgage-finance companies, to buy up and guarantee 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages paying 4.5 percent interest.
 The Treasury would provide the money by buying up the mortgage-backed securities from Fannie and Freddie. 
 The plan closely resembles a proposal developed by Christopher J. Mayer, vice dean at the Columbia Business School.
 ''This really is the opportunity of a lifetime,'' he said. ''If you ask someone if this is the time to come into the market, I think anyone who would have bought a house in 2007 and was sitting on the sidelines, or who wants to buy this year or would buy in 2010, would want to take advantage of this.'' 
 Mr. Mayer said long-term Treasury rates are so low right now that the government could actually make a profit on the cheap loans. The Treasury can sell 10-year bonds right now and pay only 2.7 percent a year, far below the 4.5 percent that it would be charging home buyers.
 But he said his own preference was to make the mortgages available to existing homeowners as well as home buyers.
 ''I think there are additional benefits one could have by extending the program for people who refinance,'' Mr. Mayer said. ''At 4.5 percent, you might be looking at 25 million people who could refinance and the average savings could be $400 to $500 a month.''
 In the past, Treasury and Fed officials often pleaded that their rescues of Wall Street were crucial to the well-being of Main Street. But the new Treasury idea would amount to directly helping Main Street.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Bernanke all but reversed the rhetoric of recent months by arguing that helping homeowners avoid foreclosure were critical for the whole economy.
 ''Steps that stabilize the housing market will help stabilize the economy as well,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''Reducing the number of preventable foreclosures would not only help families stay in their homes, it would confer much wider benefits.''
 Mr. Bernanke, speaking at a Fed conference on housing, outlined proposals for bolder government action. He suggested that the Treasury subsidize lower fees and interest rates on a new program, Hope for Homeowners, that is intended to help troubled homeowners refinance at much lower rates. At the moment, lenders pay an upfront insurance premium of 3 percent of the loan value and borrowers face fairly high interest rate of 8 percent.
 Mr. Bernanke also supported a proposal by the Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to have the government engineer as many as 1.5 million loan modifications. The Treasury and White House have fought the idea for months.
 Finally, Mr. Bernanke proposed that the government share the cost when a mortgage servicer reduces a borrower's monthly payment. Preventing foreclosures, he said, ''should be high on the agenda.''

CORRECTION-DATE: December 11, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about a proposal being weighed by the Treasury Department to push down interest rates on 30-year mortgages to 4.5 percent estimated the potential reduction in monthly payments incorrectly. The payment on a 4.5 percent loan would be 15 percent lower than the payment on a 6 percent loan -- not one-third lower.

HEADLINE: In Trade Post Contender, Political Benefits for Obama

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Peter Baker contributed reporting from Chicago, and Jackie Calmes from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
If President-elect Barack Obama appoints Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California, as his chief trade negotiator, it would punch several political tickets at once for Mr. Obama.
 Mr. Becerra, who has emerged as the leading candidate to become United States trade representative in the Obama administration, is known as a defender of workers' rights and as a skeptic of trade agreements. That would please union backers of Mr. Obama, who spoke in the campaign about reopening the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 Also, Mr. Becerra is an ally of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, another California Democrat. And he would be the second Hispanic in the new president's inner circle, consoling those disappointed that the other one, Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, was passed over for secretary of state and instead ended up at the unglamorous Commerce Department. 
 One potential hiccup to Mr. Becerra's confirmation is that he played a part in a Clinton-era commutation scandal. In this, he has less in common with Mr. Richardson than with Mr. Obama's choice for attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., who was caught up in President Bill Clinton's pardon of the financier Marc Rich.
 Mr. Becerra's entanglement -- he was among those who wrote letters to the White House asking that the case of a convicted drug dealer be reviewed -- has not impeded his rise in the House Democratic ranks. Nor is it likely to derail his chances of being confirmed, according to Democrats and Republicans.
 On Thursday, Mr. Becerra, 50, was in Chicago to meet with Mr. Obama, according to officials involved in the transition. He was said to be struggling over whether to take the job, which would mean giving up his perch in the House leadership and spending more time away from his family, said one aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the talks were private.
 If Mr. Becerra is chosen as trade representative, he will face a raft of challenges. They include whether to push a stalled free-trade agreement with Colombia and how to revive the nearly moribund world trade negotiations known as the Doha Round at a time of rising protectionist sentiment in Congress.
 Trade experts said the appointment of Mr. Becerra would suggest that Mr. Obama intended to make good on his campaign pledges to hold existing and new trade deals to tougher scrutiny.
 Mr. Becerra, who entered Congress in 1992 and serves a district in Los Angeles, voted in favor of Nafta but now says he regrets it. In 2005, he helped lead the Democratic opposition to the Central American Free Trade Agreement, emerging as an impassioned voice for the rights of workers. The deal passed the House by two votes.
 But Mr. Becerra voted in favor of a trade deal with Peru and to normalize trading relations with China. To some analysts, he symbolizes the evolution of the Democratic Party on trade over the last 15 years -- from the free-trade bent of the Clinton years toward a more protectionist stance.
 ''He's going to provide more of what labor is looking for, but he is not antitrade,'' said Frank Vargo, vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers. ''His voting record does not indicate he never met a free trade agreement he liked.''
 Mr. Vargo said he worried about Mr. Becerra's expression of regret for backing Nafta. ''If he were to become trade representative,'' Mr. Vargo said, ''he needs to keep an open mind in this.''
 Some analysts suggested that choosing Mr. Becerra would be a gesture to Mr. Obama's Democratic base after a series of economic appointments -- Timothy F. Geithner as Treasury secretary and Lawrence H. Summers as a top White House adviser -- that were viewed as sympathetic to business.
 ''We're comfortable with it,'' said Thea M. Lee, public policy director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. ''President-elect Obama has signaled that he wants trade policy to go in a different direction. The choice of Congressman Becerra indicates that he is going to hold trade policy to a high standard.''
 The toughest questions Mr. Becerra is likely to face may stem from his role in Mr. Clinton's commutation of a 15-year prison sentence for a convicted cocaine dealer in 2001. 
 Mr. Becerra repeatedly contacted the White House to ask for a review of the case, in which Carlos Vignali had been found guilty of shipping cocaine from Los Angeles to Minneapolis.
 Mr. Becerra was acting at the behest of Mr. Vignali's father, Horacio Vignali, a wealthy Los Angeles businessman who had donated nearly $14,000 to Mr. Becerra's campaign. The elder Mr. Vignali also hired Mr. Clinton's brother-in-law Hugh Rodham to lobby for his son. 
 ''The Vignali pardon was horrendous,'' said Mark Corallo, a Republican who was the spokesman for the House government reform committee when it investigated the Clinton pardons. ''The route it took was every bit as shady and tawdry as the Marc Rich pardon.''
 Still, Mr. Corallo noted, several other California politicians, including the current Los Angeles mayor, Antonio R. Villaraigosa, lobbied for clemency. ''It's one smudge,'' he said, ''in an otherwise smudgeless career.''

HEADLINE: Alaska's New Senator Sees Change at Work

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE 

 BODY:
To get elected in Alaska to the United States Senate as a Democrat sometimes requires not acting like one. Talk up drilling for oil in wildlife refuges. Talk up gun rights. Insist that those liberals who control Congress will never push you around. 
 And when your Republican rival is convicted in federal court shortly before Election Day, do not gloat. He is, after all, Senator Ted Stevens, once decreed by the State Legislature as Alaskan of the Century. 
 Of course, that was last century. 
 Mayor Mark Begich of Anchorage is the Democrat who last month pulled off what once seemed unimaginable, becoming only the second Democrat from Alaska to win a seat in Washington since his father was a member of the House of Representatives nearly four decades ago. 
 Mr. Begich's seat in the Senate has been occupied by Mr. Stevens since Mr. Begich was 6 years old and the state of Alaska was just 9. But Mr. Begich, 46, suggests there is something larger at work in his victory than just good timing in taking on a suddenly vulnerable Mr. Stevens, who was convicted in October of failing to disclose gifts and home renovations he received from a wealthy oil services industry executive. 
 ''We're a much more mature state in many ways,'' Mr. Begich told reporters a day after he declared victory. 
 As Mr. Begich describes it, Alaska is an increasingly modern state where people still support proposals to drill for oil, build pipelines and dig gold mines, but also want new sidewalks with nice landscaping, better financing for their children's education and something close to economic stability. 
 Under his watch, Anchorage has climbed out of a steep financial deficit, significantly expanded its police force, reduced violent crime, expanded its port and increased development downtown, including renovating the local history museum, installing heated sidewalks and opening a new convention center not long before Election Day. 
 It was his recognition of these new priorities, Mr. Begich says, that helped him persuade voters to make the ''emotional, tough'' decision to break from Mr. Stevens, who, he said, had ''lost touch.''
 Some people, Republicans in particular, are not buying it.
 ''You can understand why he's trying to justify his win,'' said Dave Dittman, a Republican pollster. ''No one likes to back into a championship or anything else. There is a touch of truth to it -- the state is changing -- but not enough to have elected him without the trial.''
 Mr. Begich has a history of courting skeptics, becoming mayor in 2003 (he avoided a runoff by just 18 votes) after losing twice before. He is certainly a different kind of politician from Mr. Stevens, 85, a World War II veteran and Harvard-trained lawyer who, like many other elected officials here, moved to Alaska as an adult.
 Mr. Begich, who never went to college, was born and raised in Anchorage, Alaska's only big city. His wife is the former head of the state Democratic Party, and his father, Nick, was a member of Congress. As a young man, Mr. Begich managed apartment buildings in Anchorage, and at 26 was elected to the nonpartisan Anchorage Assembly, or city council.
 ''He's a political animal,'' said Debbie Ossiander, a conservative member of the assembly. ''He is very practical. And if he can see a way to get what he wants, he'll move in that direction. But his comfort base is always with the Democrats.''
 The first major event held at Anchorage's new Dena'ina Civic and Convention Center, named for the Athabascan people native to the area, was the annual meeting of the Alaska Federation of Natives, an influential state group. Mr. Begich had personally appealed to the federation to return to Anchorage after it had moved the convention north to Fairbanks, a tactic reflective of his political style.
 Anchorage and rural areas have battled for years over state financing, but Mr. Begich was the first mayor to hire a rural affairs director. 
 ''There's been some real antagonism there,'' Ms. Ossiander said, ''and he has made a real effort to reach out, to bridge that gap. And it showed in the election results.''
 Mr. Begich won rural Alaska overwhelmingly in November, even though Mr. Stevens had delivered improvements like cleaner drinking water and airplane landing strips to remote villages. Yet the Begich name is also well known in rural areas.
 Mr. Begich's father was the last Alaska Democrat elected to the House. Nick Begich won his second term in November 1972, weeks after he was killed when a small plane he was traveling in disappeared during a campaign trip. Don Young, a Republican, won the seat in a special election the next year and still holds it. The state's last Democratic senator, Mike Gravel, was defeated in a re-election bid in 1980.
 Mr. Begich is married to Deborah Bonito, the former Democratic Party chairwoman and a small-business owner, and they have a 6-year-old son. 
 He has not lived outside Alaska since he was a boy and his father was in Congress. 
 Mr. Begich was 10 when his father died. He says he still makes a habit of keeping tools in his truck after years of helping his mother, Pegge, manage apartment buildings the family owned. He has also worked in the vending and restaurant industries and in real estate. 
 Crisp in his business suits and smooth in his delivery, the mayor has more urban polish than many other elected officials in Alaska. 
 He is a regular presence at events like mortgage bankers luncheons and chamber of commerce gatherings; he also likes to slip in stories about standing in the supermarket aisle, commiserating about the high prices with residents who may not know he is mayor. He says he seeks out the discounted day-old bread.
 Mr. Begich portrays himself as a bold and contrarian Democrat, but he becomes more elliptical when discussing certain social issues. He says he opposes amending the Constitution to ban same-sex marriage (Alaskans approved a state ban in 1998) and supports allowing same-sex couples to receive benefits through their partners.
 He did not respond directly when asked more than once whether he was for or against same-sex marriage. He supports abortion rights and says he generally opposes the death penalty, though ''sometimes I evolve on that issue.'' 
 In an interview in an Anchorage coffee shop, he said that he would work to repeal the antiterrorism legislation known as the USA Patriot Act and that he opposed allowing the government to conduct surveillance wiretaps without warrants. He noted that Mr. Stevens had supported the Patriot Act and wiretapping, while ''even Don Young voted against it.'' 
 Mr. Young also voted against the $700 billion financial bailout bill this fall while Mr. Stevens voted for it. Mr. Begich said that he would have ''reluctantly'' supported the bill, but that ''as more has been unveiled on it, I would be very hesitant today to vote for it.''
 Mr. Begich said he supported federal aid for American automakers if they presented a convincing plan to build more efficient vehicles and provide secure lending methods for people to buy them.
 Mr. Begich said his top priority in Washington would be energy policy. He said drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge could be done safely because of improved technology and should be part of a broad energy policy that also used wind, geothermal, hydropower and other renewable fuels. Saying energy policy should be shaped in the context of global warming, he pointed to street lamps on Benson Boulevard in midtown Anchorage and noted that the city was converting them to high-efficiency LED bulbs.
 ''The Republicans in our delegation didn't even wake up to climate change until I started talking about it,'' he said.
 While Mr. Stevens once threatened to campaign against lawmakers who did not support his proposals, Mr. Begich said he planned to win people over, not roll over them. 
 Asked whether he would be loud and aggressive in Congress, he said: ''I'm going to be loud and respectful. There's a difference. I'm loud when I need to be, but Ted was 'you owe me.' No one owes you anything in life. You've got to earn it.''

HEADLINE: The Miami Herald Is Said to Be for Sale

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
The McClatchy Company, burdened by debt and a steep slide in newspaper advertising, wants to sell one of its most-prized properties, The Miami Herald, according to people briefed on the company's plans. 
 McClatchy, the nation's third-largest newspaper chain, has approached potential buyers for The Herald, said these people, who asked for anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue. But they said they knew of no serious offers for the paper, reflecting the evaporation of major investors' interest in buying newspapers.
 The company refused to discuss the matter. Elaine Lintecum, the treasurer, said, ''We do not comment on market rumors.''
 The Herald is one of the largest of McClatchy's 30 daily papers, with daily circulation of 210,000, and arguably the most prestigious, having won 19 Pulitzer Prizes. But it is not clear what kind of bids it might fetch, if any; with newspaper profits shrinking fast, the economy contracting and credit tight, many newspapers have been on the block for months without selling.
 The people briefed on the company's plans say The Herald generates a very slim operating margin and that the most attractive part of any deal could be its prime waterfront real estate. But the Florida real estate market is in deep recession -- one of the reasons for the struggles of the paper, which used to benefit from heavy real estate advertising.
 The bid to sell The Herald continues the fallout from McClatchy's $4.5 billion purchase in 2006 of Knight Ridder, the newspaper chain that had owned the Miami paper. Largely as a result of that deal the company has about $2 billion in debt, payments on which eat up much of its cash flow.
 Some Wall Street analysts warned at the time that McClatchy, based in Sacramento, had overpaid, but even they did not expect the steep decline in newspaper advertising that began months later and has accelerated this year.
 The drop has been most pronounced in Florida and California, states where McClatchy has a major presence. Through the first 10 months of this year, the company's ad revenue fell 14.7 percent in other parts of the country, and 22.5 percent in California and Florida.
 McClatchy reported third-quarter income of $4.2 million on $451.6 million in revenue. The company's stock price, which topped $75 a share in 2005, closed on Friday at $2.20.

HEADLINE: A Placid North Dakota Asks, Recession? What Recession?

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

DATELINE: FARGO, N.D. 

 BODY:
As the rest of the nation sinks into a 12th grim month of recession, this state, at least up until now, has been quietly reveling in a picture so different that it might well be on another planet.
 The number of new cars sold statewide was 27 percent higher this year than last, state records through November showed. North Dakota's foreclosure rate was minuscule, among the lowest in the country. Many homes have still been gaining modestly in value, and, here in Fargo, construction workers can be found on any given day hammering away on a new downtown condominium complex, complete with a $540,000 penthouse (still unsold, but with a steady stream of lookers).
 While dozens of states, including neighboring ones, have desperately begun raising fees, firing workers, shuttering tourist attractions and even abolishing holiday displays to overcome gaping deficits, lawmakers this week in Bismarck, the capital, were contemplating what to do with a $1.2 billion budget surplus. 
 And as some states' unemployment rates stretched perilously close to the double digits in the fall, North Dakota's was 3.4 percent, among the lowest in the country. 
 ''We feel like we have been living in a bubble,'' said Justin Theel, part owner of a dealership that sells Toyotas, Dodges and Scions in Bismarck. ''We see the national news every day. We know things are tough. But around here, our people have gone to their jobs every day knowing that they're going to get a paycheck and that they'll go back the next day.''
 North Dakota's cheery circumstance -- which economic analysts are quick to warn is showing clear signs that it, too, may be in jeopardy -- can be explained by an odd collection of factors: a recent surge in oil production that catapulted the state to fifth-largest producer in the nation; a mostly strong year for farmers (agriculture is the state's biggest business); and a conservative, steady, never-fancy culture that has nurtured fewer sudden booms of wealth like those seen elsewhere (''Our banks don't do those goofy loans,'' Mr. Theel said) and also fewer tumultuous slumps. 
 As it happens, one of the state's biggest worries right now is precisely the reverse of most other states: North Dakota has about 13,000 unfilled jobs and is struggling to find people to take them.
 ''We could use more people with skills for some of these jobs,'' Marty Aas, who leads the Fargo branch of the state's Job Service North Dakota, said as his offices -- where the unemployed might come for help -- sat quiet and nearly empty. State employees outnumbered the six clients on a recent afternoon. (Mr. Aas insisted that such a slow afternoon was rare.)
 State officials and private companies have begun looking elsewhere to recruit workers, including traveling in October to Michigan, where tens of thousands of workers have been laid off, and, this month, holding an ''online job fair,'' anything to lure people to a place that is, at least for now, removed from the deep financial dismay -- if also just plain removed. 
 ''Our problem is that everybody thinks that it's a cold, miserable place to live,'' said Bob Stenehjem, a Republican and the State Senate's majority leader. ''They're wrong, of course. But North Dakota is a pretty well-kept secret.''
 With 635,867 residents, North Dakota is among the least populous states, and, in the past few years, more people have moved away, census figures show, than have moved here.
 Katie Hasbargen, a spokeswoman for Microsoft's Fargo campus, which is in the middle of a $70 million or so building expansion and is, even now, looking for a few additions to its work force (of more than 1,500), said false perceptions of the state are the problem when it comes to recruiting workers. ''The movie,'' Ms. Hasbargen said, referring to the 1996 Coen brothers' film that bears this city's name, ''didn't do us a lot of favors.''
 On a recent evening, as the night shift arrived at DMI Industries, where 383 workers (an all-time high) weld gigantic towers for wind turbines and where a $20 million expansion is under way, Phillip Christiansen, the general manager, wandered the plant, noting those who had been recruited from elsewhere -- three from Michigan not long ago, another from Louisiana. ''It's very competitive around here trying to find people,'' he said. ''In this environment, it's a little hard.''
 Not that people are complaining much. Downtown, in the line of gift shops along Broadway, where shop owners reported sales that were healthy (though always sensible), residents said they were pleased -- if a tad guilty -- about the state's relative good fortune.
 No one was gloating. No wild spending sprees were apparent. No matter how well things seemed to be going, many said they were girding, in well-practiced Midwestern style, for the worst. 
 ''You're always a little worried,'' Mr. Christiansen admitted. ''You get a tickle at the pit of your stomach.''
 In truth, economic analysts said North Dakota has already begun showing some of the painful ripples seen elsewhere. Some manufacturing companies here have lately made temporary job cuts as orders for products have dropped nationally. Shrinking 401(k)'s -- ''201(k)'s,'' some here grump -- are no bigger here than anywhere else. And, most of all, drops in oil prices and farm commodity prices are sure to sink local fortunes, experts said.
 An economist at Moody's Economy.com recently warned that conditions in North Dakota had ''slowed measurably in recent months, and the state is now at risk of being dragged into recession.'' In an interview, Glenn Wingard, the economist, described North Dakota as ''an outlier'' up to now in a broad, national slump. 
 ''It's not going to hold,'' Mr. Wingard said, suggesting that the state would now probably have to suffer through a reversal, or at least, a slowdown, much like other places that benefited from rising fortunes tied to energy, high oil prices and booming farm commodity prices. 
 Still, Ernie Goss, an economist at Creighton University in Omaha, who conducts a regular survey of economic conditions in nine states through the nation's middle, found North Dakota to be the only one expected to experience an expanding economy over the next three to six months. ''This will hit North Dakota,'' Dr. Goss said of the recession, ''I just don't think it'll ever be as significant.''
 Just as state officials in Minnesota -- due east of here -- this week revealed a staggering $5.2 billion deficit, Gov. John Hoeven of North Dakota gathered with lawmakers at the State Capitol to talk, in part, about the $1.2 billion budget surplus -- the result, in part, of increased revenues from oil, and a sum that is all the more astonishing given the size of the state's total budget, $7.7 billion over the next two years. 
 Mr. Hoeven, a Republican whose party controls both chambers of the state legislature and who was re-elected last month with more than 70 percent of the vote, offered proposals few other states are likely to hear this year: $400 million in property and income tax relief, $130 million more for kindergarten through 12th-grade education, 5 percent raises for state workers, $18 million for expansion of a state heritage center, and so on.
 The surplus, several lawmakers asserted, will actually make their jobs and choices far more complicated.
 ''Now that there is money,'' said State Senator David O'Connell, a Democrat and the party's minority leader, ''I could go to three meetings a day with people who will say they want more money or want a one-time spending package or something.''
 Mr. Stenehjem, who likewise complained that ''when you have $1.2 billion sitting around, there's about 50 billion ideas of what to spend it on,'' quickly noted that there were worse budget problems to have. 
 ''Don't get me wrong,'' he said. ''I would rather deal with this.
 ''Prudence is important at this point,'' Mr. Stenehjem, a lifelong North Dakotan, went on. ''North Dakota never gets as good as the rest of the country or as bad as the rest of the country, and that's fine with us.''

HEADLINE: Modern Robin Hoods in an Urban Jungle

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
On the face of it, ''Leverage,'' a new drama that seems to have drawn its inspiration broadly and in disproportionate measure from ''Ocean's Eleven,'' William Dean Howells and Encyclopedia Brown, comes to us this grim December with a certain prescience. The series (beginning on Sunday on TNT) devotes itself to the deflation of fat cats who have stolen, burned, bribed, defrauded: capitalist victimizers who are pierced each week by the slings and arrows of a band of independent hackers, thieves and grifters suddenly bound together to rectify the wrongs of economic disparity. How did this happen? Who has motivated them to fight the power? Richard Fuld? Alan Greenspan? A couple of subprime lenders in Phoenix? I am afraid not: it is Timothy Hutton. 
 During the initial exposition-heavy moments of the pilot, we meet Mr. Hutton as Nathan Ford, a former insurance investigator who now seems to spend his days drinking and refusing to comb his hair. In his bygone life he worked diligently for his employer, recovering stolen Monets and whatnot. But that all came to an end when the company refused to reciprocate his loyalty. 
 This, apparently, was one nasty insurance outfit -- not too-much-paperwork nasty but Satanic, as it denied Ford coverage for the experimental surgery that would have saved his young son's life. (Every other cop or pseudo-cop on television these days -- for example, in ''Monk'' and ''The Mentalist'' -- must be motivated by grief, as if the call to service were inextricable from self-involvement.) 
 Ford stumbles along until he decides to assemble his con artist associates into a team avenging corporate malfeasance, returning cash and capital to innocent men and women who have been stomped on by the soullessly greedy.
 To buy Mr. Hutton as a warrior against unethical government contractors in Iraq, conniving hedge fund managers and duplicitous real estate developers is, suffice it to say, a fairly tall order, given that as an actor in midlife, he has seemed consistently limp. Our current cultural climate almost seems to demand that he play Ford like Rambo, but Mr. Hutton ambles around as if he were a professor of creative writing, gloomy because he still wasn't tenured. 
 I'd like to be able to tell you definitively that Ford's base of operations is in New York -- close to the epicenter of all the chicanery, let's say on Pine Street -- or in Los Angeles, or in Washington, but it is never quite clear where the show is set. Neither is it clear how one of his two handmaidens ended up as an adorably well-dressed blond acrobat and thief when a flashback of her blowing up her abusive foster parents would seem to have destined her for toothlessness and a meth lab. 
 Among Ford's remaining band of acolytes, Alec the computer hacker is the most appealing, largely because the actor who plays him, Aldis Hodge, manages to convey the show's mood of levity without camping it up. In the tradition of the caper, the characters are often required to play other characters in service of their scheming, and in this case that means a lot of bad accents -- Mr. Hutton, for instance, pretending to be a congressional aide and pretending to sound like Ted Kennedy.
 ''Leverage'' was brought to television by the movie producer Dean Devlin (''Independence Day''), who may have been one of the very few Americans to feel a hint of good fortune as cries for a bailout mounted this fall: there is, one assumes, a vast, embittered audience ready for stories of the ruined rich. 
 But ''Leverage'' winds up seeming merely anachronistic, wrapping up with a cute resolution each week, the swine in handcuffs, not torn from the private hockey rinks of their Aspen vacation homes. The trouble with ''Leverage'' is that it isn't nearly as angry as we are.

HEADLINE: The Art Fair as Outlet Mall

BYLINE: By KEN JOHNSON

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, Fla. 

 BODY:
The most trenchant comment on the dazzling and enervating spectacle that is Art Basel Miami Beach is written in bold black and white letters on the floor of the Mary Boone Gallery booth. A wall-to-wall text piece by Barbara Kruger, it spells out two quotations. One, from Goethe, observes, ''We are the slaves of objects around us.'' The other, from a short story by Edgar Allan Poe, reads, ''He entered shop after shop, priced nothing, spoke no word, and looked at all objects with a wild and distracted stare.''
 These lines truly sum up the experience of a frenetic fair that embraces more than 200 galleries and many ancillary exhibitions and events in other locations in the Miami area. To take in so much art in so short a time is by turns thrilling, numbing and totally mystifying. And that's not to mention the schmooze storm of parties, business meetings, open houses and other private events orchestrated to charm the collector class. 
 The sense of art as merchandise is overpowering. A majority of what you see is portable and palatable. Most galleries offer variety-store-like mixes of works by different artists with the ambience of a sample sale. 
 Still, events like this do occasion collective soul-searching, especially now, as the art world grapples with recession. What is art for, after all, assuming that it is not just something for sale? 
 (By the way, the talk was not all gloom and doom. Dealers I spoke with said that collectors were buying, and that things were not turning out as disastrously as they had feared.)
 A response to Ms. Kruger might point out that art objects are compelling because they embody nonobjective and nonmaterial meanings and values. A sculpture by John McCracken in David Zwirner's space is apposite. A bronze monolith standing eight and a half feet tall and polished to a golden mirror- bright finish, it is an object of Minimalist reticence. Yet it incarnates certain aesthetic and spiritual values -- ideals of purity and unity, for example -- the way that gold bars in Fort Knox embody abstract monetary values.
 Still, art's social function is always ripe for renewed debate. The best work in Art Positions, a section of the fair in which galleries occupy shipping containers in an empty lot near the beach, is an installation at T293 by the French team that goes by the name Claire Fontaine. It consists of a crude sculpture of a blue horse, an obscure reference to a popular symbol of political liberation from the 1970s. The words ''Is freedom therapeutic?'' are spray-painted graffiti-style on the walls, while a poster poses the question, ''Why is art the only space of expression for a luxurious and exclusive principle of reality that makes abnormality into a source of wealth and a desirable condition?''
 Why, in other words, must the kind of radical creative freedom and idiosyncrasy we celebrate in modern art remain a commodity that only people of means can really afford? 
 So much depends on belief. Back at the main fair, in Hetzler's booth, there's a large glossy photograph by Thomas Struth in which two people are seen from behind, sitting in rapt contemplation of a triptych in the Rothko Chapel in Houston. To a Postmodernist skeptic, such quasi-religious reverence seems an amusing historic artifact. 
 Maybe that is why so many contemporary artworks toy with illusions. Playing in the gap between the believable and the unbelievable, they test our faith in the transcendentally transformative power of art. A sculpture by Frank Benson at Taxter & Spengemann that looks to be a working fountain of liquid chocolate turns out to be an object of solid, glossily painted stainless steel. The tension between appearance and reality is curiously delightful. 
 At Sperone Westwater an oversize head-and-shoulder portrait of a grizzled middle-aged man in sculptural relief by Evan Penny is so realistic in every detail that you can't help feeling a part of your psyche responding as if it were in the presence of a supernaturally living being. 
 Recent paintings by Philip Taaffe at Jablonka, in which lattice patterns are layered over glowing colors, are like stained-glass windows for a psychedelic church. The spiritual in art may be contemplated with sophisticated criticality, but it doesn't go away, even if it comes bearing a vulgar price tag.
 The fair by NADA, or New Art Dealers Alliance, abounds in works of imaginative metamorphosis. See, for example, the spooky conflations of abstraction and photographic distortion in sculptures by Ryan Johnson at Guild & Greyshkul. And at the Pulse fair, also brimming with lively work by mostly younger artists, there is a tondo studded with blinking colored lights by Leo Villareal at Conner Contemporary Art that will put you into a hallucinogenic trance.
 Videos are not so plentiful at the fairs, but there is a terrific one in a building that the New York dealers Ronald Feldman and Joe Arnheim have filled with artworks by lots of artists. Two videos in which Kenneth Shorr tells stories that start out ordinary and become increasingly bizarre are riveting and frighteningly hilarious. 
 The most transporting single artwork on view in Miami, however, is not at any of the commercial fairs. It is an astounding installation in ''The Station,'' an exhibition organized by Shamim Momin, a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, and by the New York artist Nate Lowman. This lively, scruffy show occupies parts of three floors in a building still under construction in the Miami Design District and presents works by a familiarly trendy cast of characters, including Sterling Ruby, Hanna Liden, Ryan McGinley, Tom Burr and many others.
 The piece that makes everything else there pale by comparison is ''Hello Meth Lab With a View,'' by Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe. Mr. Freeman and Mr. Lowe have created a walk-in simulation of the grungy interior of a house whose occupants have been producing crystal meth. You enter what appears to be a photography gallery and then continue into dark rooms where you behold an extraordinarily messy kitchen full of cobbled-together laboratory equipment. 
 Like Alice in a scary Wonderland, you continue through a dining room where the table is heaped with trash and packages of Sudafed and then upstairs to a claustrophobic warren of rooms where shelves are stocked with old jars of murky liquid, and where a couple of stuffed dogs are sleeping. Antique diagrams pinned to the walls suggest an equation between the heretical arts of the medieval alchemists and those of modern outlaw drug makers. Like the installations of Christoph Buchel, the work creates an obviously artificial but magically evocative virtual reality.
 Yet as a kind of high-brow funhouse, it also does little to allay Claire Fontaine's argument that modern art remains a playground for people of privilege.
 Our attention is called more urgently to social and political reality by ''30 Americans,'' an exhibition at the Rubell Family Collection. What the title of this sprawling show of more than 200 works pointedly doesn't say is that all the artists in it are of African descent. By this it means to anticipate a time when the racial identity of the United States president-elect will no longer be deemed remarkable. 
 The show includes several generations of artists who have come of age since the 1960s, including David Hammons, Robert Colescott, Barkley L. Hendricks, Kara Walker, Rashid Johnson and Kalup Linzy. No single style prevails: conceptualist photography, expressionist painting, comic video, abstract sculptures, flamboyant costumes and other modes engender a spirit of pluralistic freedom and open-ended possibility.
 If any one piece in the show could be taken as emblematic, it would be a neon sign spelling ''America'' in large letters by Glenn Ligon. The glowing white tubing has been painted black on the front but not the back, so that the letters appear backlighted by white light, a neat metaphorical reversal of our nation's historical racial landscape and an eloquent testimony to the poetic power of the well-formed object.

HEADLINE: Where Does Detroit Go From Here?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Auto Executives Face a Hard Sell on Capitol Hill'' (front page, Dec. 5):
 I am one of those skeptics who believe that no amount of money will effect changes in businesses that keep their leadership in place. Promises aside, they've led their companies into the fix they're in. A structured Chapter 11 is the way to go.
 Also, I strongly suggest to the president-elect to institute a $1 tax on every gallon of gasoline on the day he takes office. With it, he can finance the desperately needed rebuilding of our infrastructure and create jobs. We Americans must have a powerful incentive to give up our wasteful, lazy ways -- buying big cars, spending and driving unnecessarily. 
 Barack Obama must be honest with us; it's not the economy of the country that is in peril, it's the economy of the earth -- and all its inhabitants.
 Lawrence Holofcener Lake Worth, Fla., Dec. 5, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Instead of giving billions only to the automakers, how about giving half the money to the auto buyers? Every eligible car-buyer would get a voucher good only for a car made by Ford, Chrysler or General Motors. The vouchers would be good only for gas-efficient vehicles and would have no expiration date. 
 The reason the Big Three are in dire straits is that their sales are in the cellar. The vouchers should motivate the industry to produce high-demand vehicles, cut down on oil demand, help the environment, benefit Joe the Driver, if you will, and give our ailing economy a shot in the arm.
 Josh Tane Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., Dec. 5, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Even though the Big Three are to be faulted for continuing to produce fuel-inefficient vehicles, the government cannot let them fail. The negative ramifications of bankruptcy would be too damaging to current employees and the other industries that support the production of motor vehicles.
 That said, the companies need to restructure. The acknowledgment from G.M. and Ford executives that they will sell their corporate jets is a step in the right direction. But there needs to be transparency in what the auto manufacturers plan to do with the loans.
 If the government does not act swiftly to restore confidence in the car industry, sales of American-made cars will plummet. After all, the $18 billion that G.M. is asking for is less than 3 percent of the Wall Street bailout.
 Laura Johnson Gambier, Ohio, Dec. 5, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Reality Check for Detroit'' (editorial, Dec. 5):
 You have it exactly right -- the Big Three's top executives must resign. They failed a simple quiz in their first trip to Washington. 
 Which is the most cost-effective, green and safe way for executives to travel? Of the obvious answers (private jet, commercial air, train, auto, walking), they chose the worst. They were then were given the correct answer: commercial air. 
 On their second visit to Washington, they chose autos.
 After having been given the correct answers, they exhibited the same level of competence in their choice of travel as they have in becoming more competitive in their businesses. 
 How can we expect them to make the necessary changes required to save the American automobile industry? Considering past and current decisions, at a dollar a year they would be grossly overpaid.
 Thomas Dolcimascolo Atlanta, Dec. 5, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The car companies are certainly coming to Washington with their hat in hand despite having spent billions of their profits over the years lobbying Washington to forestall more fuel-economic cars. But who profited most from all of the gas-guzzling that Americans have enjoyed the last 80 years? The oil companies. 
 And yet we haven't heard one word from Congress or the auto industry about making their closest partners help with the bailout. 
 The oil companies should be forced to share some of the record profits they have made over the last few years to help bail out their biggest partner.

HEADLINE: HSBC Executive Calls Deposit Backing Unfair

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
The chief executive of HSBC's Asian operations called on Friday for Asian governments to abandon as soon as possible their guarantees of bank deposits, saying they amount to inappropriate assistance to weak banks at the risk of imposing a costly burden on taxpayers.
 Sandy Flockhart, the chief executive, said in an interview here that HSBC had enjoyed a rapid increase in deposits from savers seeking safety until two months ago. That was when Asian governments from Taiwan to Hong Kong to Singapore abruptly began providing full guarantees for deposits at banks incorporated in their territories. 
 The surge of deposits transferred from weaker banks ended with the introduction of government guarantees, and HSBC returned to its usual level of accumulating deposits, Mr. Flockhart said, adding that government guarantees now cover 93 percent of bank deposits in Asia.
 Mr. Flockhart particularly focused on HSBC's main base in Asia, Hong Kong, where the bank was founded in 1865 and where it continues to dominate the banking market. He called for an early end to deposit guarantees that are scheduled to remain in place here through 2010.
 ''We would hope that government support mechanism would be withdrawn as soon as expedient rather than wait to 2010,'' he said.
 Even if the Hong Kong government keeps universal deposit guarantees in place, it should charge weaker banks more for them, he said. He said he saw no sign of this happening so far.
 In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation already charges banks a fee for the guarantees on their deposits, with the fee calculated not only from the size of the deposits but also from the financial strength of the bank. Banks with strong balance sheets pay smaller fees for every million dollars of deposits, as an incentive for banks to keep plenty of capital.
 Many governments in Asia quickly expanded deposit insurance this autumn without trying to assess any fees.
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the main regulator of banks in the territory, responded to Mr. Flockhart's remarks with a short statement.
 ''The government has said that the measure will be in force until the end of 2010, when a decision will be taken in the light of international financial conditions on whether it should be extended,'' the monetary authority said. ''Separately, the H.K.M.A. will continue to conduct broad-based consultation on the longer-term deposit protection arrangement after the end of 2010, and then make suggestions and propose relevant amendments to the law.''
 David W. Lam, the managing director for clients in Asia and the Pacific for GAM, the big London-based asset management company, said in an interview on Thursday that there had been some shift this autumn of assets by wealthy Asian households to bank accounts in Hong Kong and Singapore to take advantage of these cities' comprehensive bank guarantees by financially strong government bodies.
 ''Some of them, not all'' are shifting money ''to a certain extent,'' although the extent of the move is hard to quantify, Mr. Lam said.
 Investors were not transferring assets from Citibank accounts to HSBC accounts before the recent assistance from the United States government to Citibank, but this was because Citibank began offering higher interest rates to attract deposits, Mr. Flockhart said.
 Although now based in London, HSBC has not sought financial assistance from either the British or American governments during the current turmoil in markets. The bank recognized its losses early in the crisis and disposed of many troubled assets before their prices could fall further.
 Mr. Flockhart said the bank, which has recently announced it was taking majority stakes in banks in India and Indonesia, would continue to remain on the lookout for other potential targets. He said that the current turmoil in the financial world could present opportunities.
 He added, however, that the cost of banking assets in emerging markets like Asia had not fallen as much as in, say, the United States, meaning they remained relatively expensive. Currency and stock market volatility, as well as uncertainty about companies' future earnings as the global economy slows, will make it hard next year to price assets in banking and other industries, he said.
 Mr. Flockhart said he did not think there would be more bank failures like the collapse in mid-September of Lehman Brothers, as governments had made it clear with a string of bailout actions that they would not allow more banks to go under. But he said he thought there would be further mergers between banks and intensified regulation.
 Slowing economic and earnings growth and tight credit conditions will also make it hard for some companies to refinance their debt next year, he said.

 SRI LANKAN ARMY PUSHES
 For Military Defeat of Rebels
 With Sri Lanka's military making its deepest push into rebel territory in a decade, Asia's longest-running civil war appears to be edging closer to a military solution. The government says its troops have ringed the rebel capital, Kilinochchi, near the northern tip of the island. But even if the rebel force is defeated, a major problem will remain: The government has yet to present a serious proposal on how this polarized multiethnic country of 21 million people will be governed.

 A RABBI'S PLAN FOR PEACE
 Menachem Froman, the chief rabbi of the Tekoa settlement in the West Bank, has been living there for 35 years, teaches at religious seminaries and wears conventional Orthodox rabbinical garb. But that is about where his similarity with other Jewish settlers in the West Bank ends. He believes in making peace with his Palestinian neighbors and has engaged in ''thousands of hours'' of dialogue, he said, with Palestinian leaders, including Yasir Arafat and leaders of the rival militant Islamist group Hamas. PAGE A8 
 ARGENTINE STIMULUS PACKAGE
 Argentina on Thursday announced a $3.8 billion stimulus package that will grant low-cost loans to farmers, automakers and other exporters, who have struggled as the slowing world economy has trimmed demand for their goods. The move is the latest attempt by the government of President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner to restore flagging confidence in her handling of the economy. But business leaders and analysts reacted cautiously to the new stimulus package, saying it was a step in the right direction but that bolder moves would be needed to head off a major devaluation or default. PAGE A8
 COALITION TROOPS LEAVING IRAQ
 The majority of the foreign troops who were part of the multinational coalition in Iraq will withdraw in the next few weeks or have already done so, because the United Nations resolution authorizing their presence expires on Dec. 31. Other than the Americans, that will leave only the British and possibly two or three other countries with very small numbers of troops. The Iraqi and British governments are holding negotiations on a withdrawal agreement for the British troops. PAGE A7 
 INMATES DIE IN KABUL UPRISING
 Eight inmates died and 13 people, including three guards, were wounded Thursday in an uprising at Pul-i-Charki prison in Kabul, Afghanistan. An official said inmates in two cellblocks rose up in an attempt to resist a security sweep. The prison, where riots are common and criminals have been able to bribe their way to freedom, has become a symbol of the dysfunction and shortcomings of the Afghan judicial system. PAGE A7

 NEW CAMPAIGN REPORT ADDS 
 To Story of Palin's Wardrobe
 Senator John McCain's presidential campaign spent more than $165,000 on a trio of stylists for Gov.

The filings furnished new details to what has become one of the lingering controversies of this year's presidential race: the expensive makeover of Ms. Palin. PAGE A9
 GOODBYE TO A SOUL FOOD LEGEND
 The aging lions of the civil rights movement who hobbled into the funeral of James V. Paschal, right, the co-founder of a legendary soul food cafe in Atlanta, mentioned the cooking only briefly.

 IN MINNESOTA, TOO CLOSE TO CALL
 The grueling hand recount of nearly all 2.9 million ballots cast in last month's Senate election in Minnesota is now complete, but whom the state will send to Washington remains uncertain. Senator Norm Coleman, the Republican incumbent, was leading Al Franken, the former comedian and a Democrat, by a margin of 687 votes, the secretary of state's office said. But the race could easily shift after a board examines 5,300 ballots still in question. PAGE A10

 Federal immigration officials said they would place no more immigration detainees at a detention center in Rhode Island that is under investigation for its treatment of a Chinese computer engineer from New York who died in custody last summer.

Honda was the circuit's biggest-spending owner; sustaining its two-car race team cost the company an estimated $217 million in 2008. The car company's departure is another example of the financial impact of the economic crisis in sports. But at Formula One, the recession is pushing the organization to a desperate financial brink.

 A golden age is on its way for first-time home buyers. How soon is impossible to know, it can only be seen in hindsight at what point the bottom arrived. But that moment is certainly getting closer. Housing prices have fallen drastically, rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are already close to 5.5 percent and may go to 4.5 percent. And first-time home buyers have the same advantage they have always had, which is that they do not have to sell their old place before buying a new one. Ron Lieber, Your Money. PAGE B1
 STOCKS RALLY ON GRIM NEWS
 All the makings of a bleak day for Wall Street were there: more uncertainty about the auto industry, grim new data on delinquent home loans and the worst monthly job losses in more than 30 years. And so the markets, as if determined to confound, surged more than 3 percent. After losing 200 points in early trading, the Dow Jones industrial average did an about-face and climbed sharply in the last hour of trading, closing up 259.18 points. PAGE B6

 The two days of economic dialogue between United States and Chinese officials that ended Friday produced a modest stream of achievements. But the talks also left many large issues unresolved, including, for the Americans, efforts to open China's financial sector to United States securities firms and, for the Chinese, oblique criticisms that America's profligate ways had sent the global economy into a tailspin and threatened China's stability.

HEADLINE: Decline of 70,600 Jobs in Canada

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- Canada lost 70,600 jobs in November, about three times more than many economists had expected, Statistics Canada reported on Friday. 
It was the biggest decline in 26 years. The government agency said that the vast majority of the lost jobs -- 66,000 -- came from Ontario, the country's main industrial center.
Canadian manufacturers, particularly in the automotive sector, are generally dependent on export sales to the United States.
The slowdown in their chief market contributed to a net loss of 38,000 manufacturing jobs.
The job losses increased the national unemployment rate by 0.1 percentage point, to 6.3 percent.
The news came just over a week after Canada's Conservative government introduced an economic plan that offered little stimulus but featured cutbacks in government spending.
That approach puzzled many economists and contributed to political turmoil that led the government to shut down Parliament on Thursday to prevent its defeat.

HEADLINE: Thieves Winning Online War, Maybe Even in Your Computer

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Internet security is broken, and nobody seems to know quite how to fix it.
 Despite the efforts of the computer security industry and a half-decade struggle by Microsoft to protect its Windows operating system, malicious software is spreading faster than ever. The so-called malware surreptitiously takes over a PC and then uses that computer to spread more malware to other machines exponentially. Computer scientists and security researchers acknowledge they cannot get ahead of the onslaught. 
 As more business and social life has moved onto the Web, criminals thriving on an underground economy of credit card thefts, bank fraud and other scams rob computer users of an estimated $100 billion a year, according to a conservative estimate by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. A Russian company that sells fake antivirus software that actually takes over a computer pays its illicit distributors as much as $5 million a year.
 With vast resources from stolen credit card and other financial information, the cyberattackers are handily winning a technology arms race. 
 ''Right now the bad guys are improving more quickly than the good guys,'' said Patrick Lincoln, director of the computer science laboratory at SRI International, a science and technology research group. 
 A well-financed computer underground has built an advantage by working in countries that have global Internet connections but authorities with little appetite for prosecuting offenders who are bringing in significant amounts of foreign currency. That was driven home in late October when RSA FraudAction Research Lab, a security consulting group based in Bedford, Mass., discovered a cache of half a million credit card numbers and bank account log-ins that had been stolen by a network of so-called zombie computers remotely controlled by an online gang. 
 In October, researchers at the Georgia Tech Information Security Center reported that the percentage of online computers worldwide infected by botnets -- networks of programs connected via the Internet that send spam or disrupt Internet-based services -- is likely to increase to 15 percent by the end of this year, from 10 percent in 2007. That suggests a staggering number of infected computers, as many as 10 million, being used to distribute spam and malware over the Internet each day, according to research compiled by PandaLabs.
 Security researchers concede that their efforts are largely an exercise in a game of whack-a-mole because botnets that distribute malware like worms, the programs that can move from computer to computer, are still relatively invisible to commercial antivirus software. A research report last month by Stuart Staniford, chief scientist of FireEye, a Silicon Valley computer security firm, indicated that in tests of 36 commercial antivirus products, fewer than half of the newest malicious software programs were identified. 
 There have been some recent successes, but they are short-lived. On Nov. 11, the volume of spam, which transports the malware, dropped by half around the globe after an Internet service provider disconnected the Mycolo Corporation, an American firm with Russian ties, from the Internet. But the respite is not expected to last long as cybercriminals regain control of their spam-generating computers. 
 ''Modern worms are stealthier and they are professionally written,'' said Bruce Schneier, chief security technology officer for British Telecom. ''The criminals have gone upmarket, and they're organized and international because there is real money to be made.''
 The gangs keep improving their malware, and now programs can be written to hunt for a specific type of information stored on a personal computer. For example, some malware uses the operating system to look for recent documents created by a user, on the assumption they will be more valuable. Some routinely watch for and then steal log-in and password information, specifically consumer financial information. 
 The sophistication of the programs has in the last two years begun to give them almost lifelike capabilities. For example, malware programs now infect computers and then routinely use their own antivirus capabilities to not only disable antivirus software but also remove competing malware programs. Recently, Microsoft antimalware researchers disassembled an infecting program and were stunned to discover that it was programmed to turn on the Windows Update feature after it took over the user's computer. The infection was ensuring that it was protected from other criminal attackers. 
 And there is more of it. Microsoft has monitored a 43 percent jump in malware removed from Windows computers just in the last half year.
 The biggest problem may be that people cannot tell if their computers are infected because the malware often masks its presence from antivirus software. For now, Apple's Macintosh computers are more or less exempt from the attacks, but researchers expect Apple machines to become a larger target as their market share grows. 
 The severity of the situation was driven home not long ago for Ed Amaroso, AT&T's chief security official. ''I was at home with my mother's computer recently and I showed her it was attacking China,'' he said. '' 'Can you just make it run a little faster?' she asked, and I told her 'Ma, we have to reimage your hard disk.' '' 
 Beyond the billions of dollars lost in theft of money and data is another, deeper impact. Many Internet executives fear that basic trust in what has become the foundation of 21st century commerce is rapidly eroding. ''There's an increasing trend to depend on the Internet for a wide range of applications, many of them having to deal with financial institutions,'' said Vinton G. Cerf, one of the original designers of the Internet, who is now Google's ''chief Internet evangelist.'' 
 ''The more we depend on these types of systems, the more vulnerable we become,'' he said. 
 The United States government has begun to recognize the extent of the problem. In January, President Bush signed National Security Presidential Directive 54, establishing a national cybersecurity initiative. The plan, which may cost more than $30 billion over seven years, is directed at securing the federal government's own computers as well as the systems that run the nation's critical infrastructure, like oil and gas networks and electric power and water systems. 
 That will do little, however, to help protect businesses and consumers who use the hundreds of millions of Internet-connected personal computers and cellphones, the criminals' newest target. 
 Despite new technologies that are holding some attackers at bay, several computer security experts said they were worried that the economic downturn will make computer security the first casualty of corporate spending cuts. Security gets hit because it is hard to measure its effectiveness, said Eugene Spafford, a computer scientist at Purdue University. 
 He is pessimistic. ''In many respects, we are probably worse off than we were 20 years ago,'' he said, ''because all of the money has been devoted to patching the current problem rather than investing in the redesign of our infrastructure.''
 The cyber-criminals appear to be at least as technically advanced as the most sophisticated software companies. And they are faster and more flexible. As software companies have tightened the security of the basic operating systems like Windows and Macintosh, attackers have moved on to Web browsers and Internet-connected programs like Adobe Flash and Apple QuickTime.
 This has led to an era of so-called ''drive-by infections,'' where users are induced to click on Web links that are contained in e-mail messages. Cyber-criminals have raised the ability to fool unsuspecting computer users into clicking on intriguing messages to a high art. 
 Researchers note that the global cycle of distributing security patches inevitably plays to the advantage of the attacker, who can continually hunt for and exploit new backdoors and weaknesses in systems. This year, computer security firms have begun shifting from traditional anti-virus program designs, which are regularly updated on subscribers' personal computers, to Web-based services, which can be updated even faster. 
 Security researchers at SRI International are now collecting over 10,000 unique samples of malware daily from around the global. ''To me it feels like job security,'' said Phillip Porras, an SRI program director and the computer security expert who led the design of the company's Bothunter program, available free at www.bothunter.net.
 ''This is always an arm race, as long as it gets into your machine faster than the update to detect it, the bad guys win,'' said Mr. Schneier.

HEADLINE: The Rich Save Their Souls (And a Few Poor People)

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Class rage must be back if even Kathie Lee Gifford gets testy with heiresses. 
 When Ivanka Trump demanded to appear on the ''Today'' show to correct personally a news item the hosts had joked about, Ms. Gifford and her co-host, Hoda Kotb, consented, but made it clear to viewers that they felt Ms. Trump was abusing her inherited clout. 
 ''Did your daddy tell you to come here and talk it over?'' Ms. Gifford asked in a saccharine, needling voice. 
 There is a new note of suspicion and defiance on cable news shows, talk shows and even on Fox's latest reality show. Its ''Secret Millionaire,'' which began on Wednesday, plucks rich, self-indulgent millionaires from their beach houses, yachts and ski chalets and drops them in the poorest neighborhoods to live incognito among the needy for a week. 
 It's not the philanthropy-as-entertainment conceit that is novel -- ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' has been a success for years. What's striking about ''Secret Millionaire,'' which was originally a British hit, is that it was adapted by Fox, a network not known for morally uplifting reality television. (It's been home to ''Temptation Island'' and ''My Big Fat Obnoxious Fiance.'') 
 The show's tone, moreover, is stripped down and humbled for the times. It's not a race or a contest in the manner of Oprah Winfrey's reality show, ''Oprah's Big Give,'' that began in March and lasted only one season. There is no ''trading places'' gimmick; the secret millionaires don't compete to see who can give away the most money; and they certainly don't win any prizes.
 Instead they strip off their Rolex watches and diamond bracelets, don sweatshirts and jeans and go undercover into the world of the homeless, the uninsured, the underpaid and overworked: Vista volunteers for a week. On their last day they go back to some of the deserving people they have met and give away at least $100,000 of their own money. (A Louisiana couple wrote checks for $300,000.)
 They do it gladly, often expiating for past excesses. ''I feel like a fool for some of the money I've spent on some things,'' Greg Ruzicka, a wealthy lawyer with houses in Newport Beach, Calif., and Maui, says to his son, Cole, after they worked construction for a few days and mingled with poor people who minister to the hungry and homeless. He recalled a two-week joy ride he and Cole went on in Mr. Ruzicka's plane, ''and burned $12,000 worth of jet fuel.''
 ''And didn't blink an eye at it,'' he added. 
 The recession has chipped away at the Gilded Age glamour of millionaires and business moguls. Senators, a species not usually known for monkish self-denial (about 62 percent could be considered millionaires) hold hearings and scold hedge fund managers and car company executives for their mega-bonuses and hedonistic business expenses. 
 Anchors and guest commentators are confrontational and bristle with populist outrage, and not just the established cable bullies like Chris Matthews or Bill O'Reilly. Recently, even the smooth, unruffled David Gregory of NBC News got a little hot under the collar discussing the Treasury Department's bailout plan. ''Do government officials,'' he indignantly asked Steven Pearlstein, a business columnist for The Washington Post, ''understand the depth of the economic problem?'' This approach actually started during the election season, when the financial meltdown began, and anchors like Campbell Brown of CNN and Megyn Kelly of the Fox News Channel dispensed with the usual politesse and tore into mealy-mouthed or disingenuous guests. Both anchors made mincemeat of a McCain spokesman, Tucker Bounds; the tongue-lashing that Ms. Campbell gave him proved so popular on YouTube.com that CNN created a new, more belligerent format for her show, somewhat inelegantly entitled, ''No Bias, No Bull.'')
 Much in the way that in the wake of Sept. 11 and the Iraq invasion, anchors followed the national mood, donning flag pins and a patriotic demeanor, the recession has put even mild-mannered anchors in touch with their inner Upton Sinclair. 
 And reality television appears to be just as susceptible to trends. Lots of shows have tried to help people in need in an entertaining way. ''Secret Millionaire'' lets the poor help the rich find their way back to righteousness. 
 ''So many wealthy people think that people are poor because, you know, they are ignorant or uneducated,'' Cole Ruzicka, a handsome but rather spoiled slacker, says bitterly after visiting parents who have a little girl with bone cancer and no insurance. ''Well, it's the people with all the money living this little dream fantasy that are the ignorant ones.''

HEADLINE: A Domino Effect In the Global Work Force

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
THE world recession is spreading, and the employment outlook is turning down almost everywhere.
 Even in countries like China, the latest surveys of companies show they are reducing their work forces, providing more evidence that China cannot be the engine of the world economy when the traditional industrial powers suffer. 
 Moreover, the current recession in America, unlike the mild one in 2001, is spreading across most of the economy. Service industries, most of which suffered only a little then, are being hurt much more now.
 The employment figures for November, released on Friday, showed that since private-sector service employment peaked last December, one million jobs have been lost, about 100,000 more than during the 2001 recession.
 Over all, the unemployment rate rose only to 6.7 percent, from 6.5 percent in October. But that appears to be because many people stopped looking for work and were not counted as unemployed.
 The accompanying charts are based on the survey conducted by the Institute for Supply Management in the United States and by a variety of organizations in other countries. Markit Economics, a London firm, and JPMorgan Chase collect the data and compile it into a global index.
 The overall indexes have fallen sharply in recent months, but the charts focus on one of the subindexes, for employment. These are diffusion indexes, in which a reading of 50 indicates most employers are neither hiring nor firing. The lower the number goes, the sharper the jobs contraction.
 In the United States, the manufacturing employment number fell to 34.2 in November, just a little below the worst reading of the 2001 recession, and close to the 33.6 low in the 1990-91 recession.
 The figure for the rest of the world, available only since 2005, is calculated by taking the United States contribution out of the global figure. It held up longer than the American figure, but in November it fell to 42.0, indicating a steeper decline. The figures in the majority of countries are falling quickly.
 In the nonmanufacturing, or service, industries, the United States ''survey is currently massively worse than the 2001 recession,'' wrote Jason Rotenberg of Bridgewater Associates. That indicated, he added, that the total job loss in that sector was likely to be much greater than in 2001.
 During the last recession, the survey number for service employment fell to 42.9, a drop that was far less severe than in the manufacturing area. But in the current downturn, which officially began last December, the figure has plunged to 31.3, the lowest since that survey began in 1997, and even lower than the manufacturing figure.
 For the rest of the world, the falloff is a little less severe, but it, too, is worse than the manufacturing survey.
 ''This picture is unlikely to brighten near term,'' said David Hensley, the director of global economics coordination at JPMorgan, ''as confidence has collapsed and credit conditions show limited signs of improving.''

HEADLINE: Holding On At Building Stripped To Timbers

BYLINE: By JIM DWYER. 
E-mail: dwyer@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Without a word, Ana Reynoso, age 87, swings open the door to Apartment 32. Strangers shuffle in to look at the state of her home, which consists of three fine bedrooms and zero baths. Nearly all the bathrooms above and below in the same line of apartments were ripped out in January by the landlord to shore up damaged walls. Ms. Reynoso uses the bathroom in an empty apartment down the hall.
 Two stories up, on the fifth floor, Aida Wenzell shows visitors her bathroom, now stripped to the building's timber bones. ''Almost a year, that is how this room has been,'' she said. 
 It is hard to walk through the building at 452 Fort Washington Avenue, a handsome old apartment house in Washington Heights in Upper Manhattan, and not catch a whiff of madness. And it's not simply the missing bathrooms or the 415 violations cited by the city. 
 Of the 54 apartments in the building, 25 are vacant -- some of them for years, the tenants say. And in 15 of the 29 occupied apartments, the residents have been on a rent strike for two years, putting their payments into escrow.
 That means that through one of the greatest real estate booms in the history of New York, the owner of the building, Dorothea Levine, has been collecting rent on 14 apartments, less than one-third of the building. Not just the housing code is being violated: the laws of economic self-interest are broken every month.
 ''She's forgoing roughly $50,000 a month in income just from the empty apartments,'' said Bruno Bianchi, a lawyer for the tenants. ''I don't quite understand why she would do it.''
 The customary explanation would be that the absent bathrooms are a form of tactical neglect, intended to drive out longtime tenants who pay below-market rents, and that in the meantime Ms. Levine is warehousing apartments as they become vacant. But the city is teeming with people, and demand for rental apartments in Washington Heights is strong -- especially in buildings like 452 Fort Washington, which is one block from the 181st Street stop for the A train. In effect, this is a broken A.T.M.
 ''The rooms are huge,'' Mr. Bianchi said. ''With this owner, I don't get the logic of it.''
 Ms. Levine grew up in the building, which was owned by her parents. She now lives elsewhere, according to Greg Healy, the property manager for 452 Fort Washington.
 ''The building is very personal to her,'' Mr. Healy said in an interview last month. ''There has never been a plan to condo or co-op the building. There's never been a plan to do anything else. She has received almost nil from the tenants for two years. At this point, she is carrying the building almost entirely by herself.''
 Ms. Levine intends to renovate the vacant apartments and rent them, Mr. Healy said, but a family illness has taken all her attention for several years. 
 As for the missing bathrooms, the story is lodged in six different pending court cases.
 Last year, a leak inside a wall was not discovered until water had damaged the building. Contractors hired by the landlord began to remove the bathrooms in the 2 line of apartments to get at the damage. The tenants -- with backup from the Department of Buildings -- said the contractors did not have proper permits.
 ''The tenants refused to let the landlord's contractors in,'' said Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. ''Then we tried to send contractors, and the landlord refused to let us in.''
 One of the tenant leaders, Gladys Salva, is on the 2 line, and she said she barred the landlord's contractors because even though her bathroom floor was pitched sharply to one side, it was still usable. Her adult daughter is severely disabled, and Ms. Salva, 75, said she could not get her to a bathroom in another apartment. 
 She insisted that the landlord restore an old half-bathroom that had been removed from her apartment before she moved in. Once she had a toilet and sink in her home, she said, she would permit the contractors to come in and remove the full-size bathroom. 
 That stalemate was finally broken this week, when the landlord restored the half-bathroom in Ms. Salva's apartment. Work is expected to resume on the shoring of the beams damaged in last year's leak, Mr. Bianchi said. After that, the bathrooms will be restored. 
 Andrew Massa, 76, moved into the building 68 years ago. ''We had stained-glass windows in the halls, and a man to operate the elevator,'' Mr. Massa said. ''I remember the landlord's family. I never thought we'd come to this.''

HEADLINE: Maybe It's Time to Buy That First House

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
Five or 10 years from now, when the financial crisis has ended and housing prices are up smartly once more, we will look in the rearview mirror and realize that we missed a golden age for first-time home buyers.
 Then, everyone who sat on their down payment savings accounts for a few years too long will kick themselves for not taking advantage of what may turn out to be the buying opportunity of a lifetime for those who can qualify for a mortgage.
 Unfortunately, we do not know when this golden age will begin, because we will be able to identify a bottom to the housing market only with the benefit of hindsight. But as it does with the stock market, the moment will probably arrive when everyone is feeling the most pessimistic. 
 That moment is certainly getting closer. Housing prices have fallen drastically from their peak levels in many areas of the country. Rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages are already close to 5.5 percent, and this week there were suggestions that the federal government might try to drive them down to 4.5 percent, a truly incredible figure to be able to lock in for three decades. 
 Meanwhile, first-time home buyers have the same advantage they have always had, which is that they do not have to sell their old place before buying a new one. That is an added advantage in areas where many available houses simply are not moving, because the people trying to sell them will not be bidding against you. 
 If you're hoping for a recovery in the housing market, you ought to be cheering on the first-time home buyers. When they purchase homes, their sellers are free to move on or move up, stimulating further sales. 
 But if you are a potential first-time buyer yourself, or lending or giving the down payment to one, you are probably as frightened as you are tempted by all the ''For Sale'' signs that have become ''On Sale'' signs. So let's quickly review some of the still-grim pricing data in certain areas -- and consider the reasoning offered up by first-time buyers who have forged ahead anyhow. 
 As is always the case with real estate, much depends on location. One study, ''The Changing Prospects for Building Home Equity,'' tries to predict where today's first-time buyers in the 100 biggest metropolitan areas may actually have less home equity by 2012 as a result of continued price declines. The verdict was that buyers in 33 of the markets could see a decline by 2012, including potential six-figure drops on an average home in the New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle metropolitan areas.
 This is obviously scary. (I've linked to the study, a joint effort of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the National Low Income Housing Coalition, from the version of this article at nytimes.com/yourmoney.) It's worth noting, however, that these predictions came before the government made its most recent move to reduce borrowing costs. 
 Also, the price projections in the study are based, in part, on the fact that the ratio of purchase prices to annual rents is still higher in many areas than the historical average, which is roughly 15 times rents. While past figures may well have some predictive value, I have never been convinced that first-time buyers compare a home that they could own and one that they would rent in purely or even primarily economic terms. 
 When Jaime and Michael Proman moved this fall to Minneapolis, his hometown, from New York City, they craved a different sort of life after two years together in a 450-square-foot studio apartment. ''We didn't want a sterile apartment feel,'' said Mr. Proman, who is 28 (his wife is 26). ''We wanted something that was permanent and very much a reflection of us.''
 The fact is, in many parts of the country there are few if any attractive rentals for people looking to put down roots and enjoy the sort of amenities they may spot on cable television home improvement shows. Comparing a rental with a place that you may own seems almost pointless in these situations, especially for those who are now grown up enough to want to make their own decisions about decor without consulting the landlord. 
 Still, for anyone feeling the urge to buy, a number of practical considerations have changed in the last year or two. The basics are back, like spending no more than 28 percent of your pretax income on mortgage payments, taxes and insurance. Even if a lender does not hold you to this when you go in for preapproval, you should hold yourself to it.
 You will also want to start now on any project to improve your credit score because it may take several months to get it above the 720 level that qualifies you for many of the best mortgage rates. 
 John Ulzheimer, president of consumer education for credit.com, a consumer credit information and application site, suggests starting to pay down and put away credit cards months before you apply for a loan. That is because the credit scoring system could penalize you if you use a lot of credit each month, even if you always pay in full. Also, check your three credit reports (it's free) at annualcreditreport.com and dispute errors. 
 While no one can easily predict the likelihood of losing a job, Friday's startling unemployment figures suggest the need for caution if you think you might be vulnerable. A. C. Panella, who teaches communications at Pasadena City College in California, waited until she had a tenure-track job before buying a home in the Highland Park section of Los Angeles with her partner, Amy Goldman, a lawyer for a nonprofit organization. ''We could afford the mortgage payment on one salary, were something to come up,'' Ms. Panella, 31, said. ''It's really about being able to stay within our means.''
 For many first-time home buyers, that philosophy stretches to the down payment, too. Ms. Panella and her partner put down 20 percent when they bought their home in September, as did the Promans when they bought their home in the Lowry Hill neighborhood of Minneapolis.
 Alison Nowak, 29, put just 3 percent down on a Federal Housing Administration-backed loan last month when she and her partner, Lacey Mamak, bought a $149,900, 800-square-foot home several miles south of where the Promans live. ''Anything that is an opportunity also has a bit of risk,'' she said. Her house was in foreclosure before a plumber bought it and fixed it up. ''One way we mitigated it was that we bought a really tiny house in a very good neighborhood.'' 
 One other strategy might be to buy new instead of used. Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist for the research firm High Frequency Economics, says he believes that a steep drop-off in inventory of new homes is coming soon, thanks to a rapid decrease in home builder activity. 
 Since prices generally soften in the winter, it may make sense to start looking seriously once the mercury bottoms out. ''If you look at new developments next spring, you may not have the choice you thought you would have or be in the bargaining position you thought you would be,'' Mr. Shepherdson said. Also, if you wait after June 30, you will miss out on a $7,500 federal tax credit for income-eligible first-time home buyers that works like an interest-free loan.
 Finally, allow yourself to consider how it would feel if you bought and then prices dropped another 10 or 15 percent. It might not bother you if you plan to stick around. Plenty of people seem to be making a longer commitment to their homes. According to a survey that the National Association of Realtors released last month, typical first-time buyers plan to stay in their home 10 years, up from 7 last year. 
 Perhaps people are more aware that they will not be able to build equity as rapidly as others did in the real estate boom. Or they simply have more confidence in hard, hometown assets now than in other markets.
 ''We wouldn't let another decline bother us,'' said Michael Proman. ''You can never time a bottom. This is a long-term investment for us, and it truly is the best investment we have in our portfolio right now.''

HEADLINE: Honda Pulls Out Of Formula One, Rattling the Sport

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR, MARK McDONALD and BRAD SPURGEON. 
Mark McDonald reported from Hong Kong and Brad Spurgeon from Paris.

 BODY:
This article was reported by Mark McDonald, Brad Spurgeon and Richard Sandomir and written by Mr. Sandomir
Formula One, which bills itself as the world's richest sport and races in some exotic locales, was stung Friday by the withdrawal of the Honda Motor Company, the open-wheel circuit's biggest-spending owner, which is reeling from the worldwide financial crisis.
''Honda must protect its core business activities and secure the long term as widespread uncertainties in the economies around the globe continue to mount,'' said Takeo Fukui, the chief executive of Honda, Japan's No. 2 automaker, at a news conference in Tokyo. He added, ''I offer my sincere apologies to everyone involved.'' 
Sustaining its two-car race team of Jenson Button and Rubens Barrichello cost Honda an estimated $217 million in 2008. The price proved too steep amid weak auto sales and a rising yen. Honda's November sales in the United States fell 32 percent. The team is looking for a new owner before the 2009 season begins in March in Melbourne, Australia.
At Formula One -- whose 11 teams spent $1.6 billion during the 2008 season -- the recession is pushing the organization to a desperate financial brink. Even before Honda's decision to get out, the circuit's governing body, the International Automobile Federation, called its spending figure ''unsustainable.''
Honda has been in and out of Formula One since the 1960s. Most recently it provided engines to the British American Racing team in 2000, and then bought the team outright in 2006, when it began to race under the Honda name.
The car company's departure from Formula One is a dramatic example of the financial impact the economic downturn is having in sports. There have been layoffs at the N.B.A. league office, the suspension of testing for the 2009 season at Nascar tracks, General Motors' premature severing of its ties to Tiger Woods, and Major League Baseball's freezing employment and budgets.
After Honda's announcement about Formula One, the federation said ''the global economic downturn has only exacerbated an already critical situation.''
''No one knows how serious the world crisis is,'' Max Mosley, president of Formula One's governing body, was quoted as saying on Bloomberg.com. ''It's not just the racing teams. It affects fans' abilities to attend racing and sponsors' paying fees.''
With Honda gone, Formula One bloggers speculated about the future of the Toyota team and others on the circuit. Toyota, the world's largest automaker, saw its November sales plunge 34 percent from last year. But Toyota is staying in Formula One for now. A company spokesman said it would introduce its new racing car on Jan. 15 over the Internet.
The problems for Formula One, and to a lesser extent Nascar, are spiking as the Big Three Detroit automakers are pleading for a financial bailout from the United States government.
Executives of G.M., Ford and Chrysler testified to Senate and House committees this week, asking to receive $34 billion in loans, and they received a bit of support from Brian France, Nascar's chairman. In letters sent Tuesday to House and Senate members, he wrote that the ''domestic automobile manufacturers play a very important part of the heritage of Nascar, but more importantly, it is vital for all of America.''
On Friday, as Nascar prepared for its end-of-season celebration in Manhattan, two of its racing teams, Petty Enterprises and Gillett Everham Motorsports, were the subject of reports about merger talks, but neither side would comment.
In June, a 60 percent stake in Petty Enterprises was sold to Boston Ventures, a private equity firm. Last month, Chip Ganassi Racing and Dale Earnhardt Inc. agreed to merge into a four-car team led by Martin Truex Jr. and Juan Pablo Montoya.
SI.com reported that about 500 jobs had been lost to cutbacks at Nascar.
''Perhaps the reason for these mergers is teams hope that one plus one will equal three in terms of providing a better overall opportunity for sponsors,'' said David Carter, a sports industry analyst at the University of Southern California. ''This is a buyer's market for sponsors, but the problem is buyers are having a hard time justifying the spending.''
Andrew Giangola, a spokesman for Nascar, said the racing organization had not laid off any employees at its central office, but that within teams, a 3 to 5 percent reduction was expected.
''We're not immune to the downturn by any means,'' Giangola said. ''That said, our average attendance at Sprint Cup events was nearly 120,000 this season,'' which he said was a decrease of nearly 10 percent.
''As far as next season, we hope to have full car counts, and a fully funded field, but it remains to be seen how that shakes out,'' he said. ''A few years ago, we had 52 to 53 cars trying to qualify each week, but that's dropped down.''
He said that Honda's decision to leave Formula One did not have a direct effect on Nascar, whose racecars are dominated by cars made by Ford and Chevrolet, a G.M. brand.
Both companies, with billions of dollars in losses, plummeting sales and cash running out, have said they will remain with Nascar for the immediate future.
Honda's involvement in the Indy Racing League, the United States-based open-wheel circuit, is expected to continue, according to a statement from the American Honda Motor Company. Honda is the sole provider of engines for the circuit.
Correction: December 10, 2008, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about the Honda Motor Company's announcement that it would withdraw from Formula One racing as a response to the global financial crisis referred incorrectly to the changing value of the yen. It has been rising, not falling. (The situation makes the products of an exporter like Honda more expensive outside Japan at a time when auto sales are weak.)

HEADLINE: STEEP JOB LOSSES ADD TO PRESSURE FOR U.S. STIMULUS

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, EDMUND L. ANDREWS and STEPHEN LABATON; Jack Healy contributed reporting.

 BODY:
This article was reported byLouis Uchitelle, Edmund L. AndrewsandStephen Labatonand written by Mr. Uchitelle.
The government's report of a giant job loss in November, the biggest monthly decline in a generation, puts more pressure on Congress and the administration to move quickly on a stimulus package, mortgage relief and perhaps financial aid for Detroit's big automakers.
The nation's employers cut 533,000 jobs in November, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported Friday.
Not since December 1974, toward the end of a severe recession, have so many jobs disappeared in a single month -- and the current recession, far from ending, appears to be just gathering steam. 
''We are caught in a downward spiral in which employment, incomes and spending are collapsing together,'' said Nigel Gault, chief domestic economist for IHS Global Insight. ''With private spending frozen, we have no choice but to rely on a stimulus package to revive the economy.''
The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent, up just two-tenths of a percentage point from October, but up six-tenths over the last three months. More than 420,000 men and women who had been working or seeking work in October left the labor force in November.
More significantly, the unemployment rate does not include those too discouraged to look for work any longer or those working fewer hours than they would like. Add those people to the roster of the unemployed, and the rate hit a record 12.5 percent in November, up 1.5 percentage points since September.
Noting that 1.9 million jobs have been lost since the start of the recession a year ago -- two-thirds of them since September -- President-elect Barack Obama invoked public spending as the best way to get a dead-in-the-water economy moving again. ''This painful crisis,'' he said in a statement, is an opportunity ''to improve the lives of ordinary people by rebuilding roads and modernizing schools for our children,'' and by investing in clean energy projects.
A goal of all this spending is to generate 2.5 million jobs over the next two years, he said, repeating an earlier pledge. Given the accelerating job losses, hitting that target would barely recover the jobs that have disappeared over the last year.
As part of Friday's announcement, the government revised higher its estimates of jobs lost in September and October. Instead of 524,000 jobs disappearing in those months, 723,000 were lost, or a total of 1.2 million jobs in just three months. In all, jobs have been lost in each of the last 11 months.
''Obama is being deliberately unclear about those 2.5 million jobs,'' said Robert Pollin, a University of Massachusetts economist. ''He is not going to add 2.5 million on top of recovering the 1.9 million that have been lost so far this year.''
Despite the deterioration of the labor market, Democrats in Congress and a lame-duck president remain in a standoff over rescue measures.
At its core, the stalemate between the Republicans and the Democrats springs from fundamentally different views about the nature of the crisis and the role of government in resolving it. The White House contends that it has rightly focused on the credit and housing markets, while the Democrats see economic problems that can be resolved only through broader intervention.
New efforts to adopt a broad economic package are likely to wait until the new president takes office and Democrats have bigger majorities in Congress. That delay poses the possibility of a deeper recession, according to some experts.
President Bush, appearing in front of cameras on Friday morning at the White House, said he was ''concerned about our workers who have lost jobs.'' But he offered no hint of softening his opposition to either a stimulus package or a bailout of the automobile industry, saying that the measures already put in place by the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to ease credit problems would take time to work.
Shortly after his appearance, a White House spokesman, Scott Stanzel, dashed any expectation of a change in policy when he said that officials expected a stimulus package would ''happen in the next administration.''
Support is building for a significant stimulus package as the economy slips into a deep recession. Most forecasters expect the gross domestic product to contract in the current fourth quarter at an annual rate of 4 or 5 percent, and continue to contract through most of next year, shrinking by 2 percent for all of 2009 -- a contraction that has occurred only once since World War II: in 1982, a year of severe recession.
''If there was any doubt that a very large fiscal stimulus is required, then the numbers we have been getting recently should dispel that doubt,'' said Jan Hatzius, chief domestic economist for Goldman Sachs. To offset the private sector retrenchment, he added, ''we will need a stimulus package of $600 billion at an annual rate, or $1.2 trillion over two years.''
Economists and policy makers increasingly share his estimate of what it will take to revive America's $14 trillion economy, with Democratic leaders talking recently about a stimulus package of $400 billion or more.
Though any broad economic package seems to be delayed, Democrats still had faint hopes of approving next week a rescue package for the car companies. Their goal would be to prevent far more rapid deterioration in the job market.
The latest job numbers were stark evidence of a breakdown in consumer spending and business investment since mid-September, when the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve decided to let Lehman Brothers fail, delivering a shock to the financial sector. Almost simultaneously, stock prices began a free fall, undermining the wealth and the retirement accounts of millions of Americans.
''We have recorded the largest decline in consumer confidence in our history,'' said Richard T. Curtin, director of the Reuters/University of Michigan Survey of Consumers, which started its polling in the 1950s.
Job loss has played a big role in this erosion, he acknowledged. But so have fewer hours of work, smaller bonuses, less overtime, falling home prices, falling stock prices and a drumbeat of job cut announcements -- the most recent, this week, from big names like AT&T, Viacom, CVS, DuPont and the Avis Budget Group.
The Dow Jones industrial average, down more than 20 percent since mid-September, fell Friday morning in response to the November jobs report, but recovered later and gained 259.18 points, or 3 percent, by the end of trading, to close at 8,635.42.
With home prices still in decline, one in 10 mortgage holders was either delinquent on loans in September or in foreclosure, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported Friday. That was up from 9.2 percent in June and the highest percentage since the association began to collect this data 30 years ago.
The mortgage crisis makes lenders ever more reluctant to lend for the purchase of homes, autos and other big consumer items. In more normal times, lenders bundle these loans into securities and sell them. The buyers of these securities have disappeared in the current credit crisis, however, and the Federal Reserve is considering ways for lenders to borrow from the Fed, using the securities as collateral.
Jobs disappeared last month from every sector of the economy except health care and state government, which mainly added educators. The biggest losses were in manufacturing, construction, retailing -- despite the first month of Christmas shopping -- financial services, hotel and restaurant work and temporary workers. Over the course of the recession, 604,000 jobs -- nearly one-third of the total -- have been eliminated in manufacturing, and the Big Three automakers promise more layoffs to qualify for a federal bailout.
''Business shut down in November,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com. ''Businesses are in survival mode and are slashing jobs and investment to conserve cash. Unless credit starts flowing soon, big job losses will continue well into next year.''
The administration says its recent actions are beginning to make credit flow more easily. ''We are pulling some very significant levers on the economy right now, through what we're doing with Treasury and what we're doing with the Fed,'' said Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman.

HEADLINE: The Senate, Snowe and Dinkytown

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS. 
Bob Herbert is off today.

 BODY:
This week Senator Saxby Chambliss won a runoff vote in Georgia. It's possible you missed this. Perhaps you were busy -- oh, I don't know, maybe contemplating the unemployment rate or learning to darn holes in old socks or embarking on a promising new career in the booming field of squirrel hunting. 
 Anyhow, the Georgia runoff was more important than you might imagine. Certainly more significant than anything Chambliss has done since he skipped a closed-door Senate session on Iraq intelligence data to go golfing with Tiger Woods. His victory means that the Republicans will have at least 41 seats in the Senate when Barack Obama becomes president. (This is actually going to happen eventually. I promise.) 
 Since it takes 60 senators to force a vote on a bill, if the Republicans stick together they can stop things from happening. Maintaining the capacity to bring things to a screeching halt is important for any party, so all the gang went down to Georgia to rally the troops. Mitt! Mike! McCain! Together again, just like in the primaries, with a stuffed manatee playing the part of Fred Thompson. ''If we give them a blank check, they will sign that check and be taking money out of our pockets,'' warned Rudy Giuliani, whose total failure as a presidential candidate clearly has not affected his ability to turn a phrase.
 And the troops heard their call. One woman at a Sarah Palin rally told The Times's Robbie Brown that she was terrified that Obama was ''going to push a socialist agenda'' but that she was sure ''Saxby Chambliss can stop him.'' 
 Now Chambliss has been a senator for six years, and his greatest achievement was getting ranked the 33rd best golfer in Washington by Golf Digest. It is highly unlikely that he could stop the president from doing anything beyond making a putt.
 But it's probably just as well that he won. Otherwise, the fate of that 60th seat would depend on the recount of the Minnesota senate race between Al Franken and Norm Coleman, which is going to last as long as the Mesozoic Era. Franken -- in a count disputed by Coleman and the secretary of state -- claims to be four votes ahead, and the results seem to hinge on a missing envelope containing 133 ballots from Dinkytown, a neighborhood near the University of Minnesota. While I'm sure it's a great place to live, we really do not want to spend the next six months reading headlines like ''It All Depends on Dinkytown.'' 
 Besides, if the Democrats did get the 60 seats, one of them would belong to Joe Lieberman. You may recall that although Lieberman spent the last year campaigning for John McCain (and, as it turns out, donating money to Republican candidates for the senate), the Democrats were so desperate to keep him in their caucus that they caved in to his demands to keep his committee chairmanship. If Lieberman had turned out to be Mr. 60, he would not only have wanted the committee, he would have insisted on being carried to all its meetings on a litter, borne by the fellow senators who failed to appreciate him, with Lindsey Graham running ahead, clashing cymbals.
 Above all, you have to love the fact that as things stand, the nexus of power will lie in the Republican moderate caucus, consisting entirely of the two senators from Maine, the Republicans Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins. 
 ''And Senator Specter,'' corrected Snowe.
 And Arlen Specter from Pennsylvania, although ''moderate'' and ''deeply, deeply, deeply politically pragmatic'' are not precisely the same thing. But I like thinking of next year's senate as a kind of mythic quest movie in which a Democratic hero in need of a stimulus package or a Supreme Court confirmation is told: ''Go forth and seeketh the Women of Maine,'' who would both be played by Cate Blanchett.
 Olympia Snowe, the senior senator, is widely regarded as one of Congress's quality acts. In fact, some people might have wondered why John McCain, if he was so desperate for a woman on his ticket, ignored a well-traveled, independent-minded experienced legislator who does her homework in favor of an out-to-lunch moose-murderer who cannot seem to put together a coherent sentence. 
 ''Well, you know, John made the decision he did,'' said Snowe vaguely.
 Snowe seems very conscious of how key her role could be over the next few years, since she talks about building bridges with the enthusiasm of an Alaskan pork-monger. In recent years, she said, she's been ''embarrassed for our institution. I couldn't possibly explain to my constituents what was going on here, the all-or-nothing drawing lines in the sand.''
 You could imagine the next senate looking like the Supreme Court in the age of Sandra Day O'Connor, which is to say frequently frustrating but generally sensible.
 We could do so very much worse.

HEADLINE: Democrats Set To Offer Loans For Carmakers

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Faced with staggering new unemployment figures, Democratic Congressional leaders said on Friday that they were ready to provide a short-term rescue plan for American automakers, and that they expected to hold a vote on the legislation in a special session next week.
Seeking to end a weeks-long stalemate between the Bush administration and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, senior Congressional aides said that the money would most likely come from $25 billion in federally subsidized loans intended for developing fuel-efficient cars.
By breaking that impasse, the lawmakers could also clear the way for the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., to request the remaining $350 billion of the financial industry bailout fund knowing he will not get bogged down in a fight over aiding Detroit.
Democrats are hoping Mr. Paulson will use some of that money to help individual homeowners avoid foreclosure. 
''We have had constructive discussions with members of Congress from both houses, and both sides of the aisle,'' President Bush's spokeswoman, Dana Perino, said in a statement released Saturday. ''We hope to continue to make progress toward assistance for the automakers based on important principles -- that taxpayer assistance only be considered for companies willing to make the difficult decisions across the scope of their businesses to be viable and competitive in the future; that taxpayer assistance should come from funds already appropriated in the program specifically intended to assist automakers -- the auto loan program; and that assistance is accompanied by very strong taxpayer protections. Taxpayers should not be asked to finance assistance for automakers without a strong likelihood that they will be paid back.''
The short-term plan is intended to help the automakers survive until the new administration takes over in January and can craft a longer-term solution to the industry's troubles.
President-elect Barack Obama and his transition team have been working with Congressional leaders on both counts. Ms. Pelosi spoke to Mr. Obama on Thursday, and to Rahm Emanuel, Mr. Obama's chief of staff, twice on Friday.
Ms. Pelosi also spoke by phone on Friday with Joshua B. Bolten, President Bush's chief of staff, and the White House, too, seemed ready to reach a deal.
''We're continuing to talk to both parties and both houses of Congress, and we hope to make more progress this weekend,'' said Tony Fratto, the White House deputy press secretary.
Details of the auto companies' rescue package were not immediately available, but senior Congressional aides said that it would include billions of dollars in short-term loans to keep the automakers afloat at least until Mr. Obama takes office.
The auto companies will have to submit to strict government oversight to make sure that the bailout funds are used to carry out the reorganization plans they delivered to Congress this week. The auto company chiefs testified this week that they were willing to accept such regulation.
Ms. Pelosi had resisted using money from the fuel-efficiency program, which was approved as part of an energy bill last year, and Democrats had repeatedly called on the Bush administration or the Federal Reserve to act unilaterally, using existing authority, to aid the auto companies.
On Friday, Ms. Pelosi said she would allow that money to be used provided ''there is a guarantee that those funds will be replenished in a matter of weeks'' and there was no delay in working toward greater fuel efficiency.
Word of a breakthrough came as Congress wrapped up two days of hearings at which lawmakers grilled the chief executives of the companies -- Chrysler, the Ford Motor Company and General Motors -- and experts warned that G.M. could collapse by the end of this month.
The automakers seemed tentatively heartened by the progress at the Capitol. ''We're encouraged by Speaker Pelosi's intent to move forward quickly to resolve a crisis that can only grow more serious without action,'' said Greg Martin, a spokesman.
The proposed deal could still fall apart for several reasons.
It was unclear Friday how much support would come from Republicans, particularly in the Senate where procedural hurdles are high. Crucial details remain to be worked out, including how to restore the money to the fuel-efficiency program.
Under federal budget rules, those loan guarantees are now likely worth less than $25 billion because of the deteriorating condition of the auto companies. Congress appropriated $7 billion this fall to secure those loans. But now that the automakers' finances have worsened, the default risk has increased substantially.
Congressional aides said that staff would work through the weekend to determine how much money would be available to aid the auto companies under the current conditions.
Under the financial system rescue law approved by Congress in October, the Treasury secretary must request the second $350 billion, and Congress then has 15 days to disapprove the disbursement. Congressional leaders, upset over Mr. Paulson's management of the bailout program, have warned him that if he wants the money, he must ask for it by the end of next week.
Until the breakthrough Friday evening, it had appeared unlikely that Mr. Paulson would be able to persuade Congress to release the funds. Of the first $350 billion portion of the rescue fund, only $15 billion remains uncommitted.
It was the Labor Department's report of 533,000 jobs lost in November that seemed to halt the hand-wringing on Capitol Hill over what to do about the auto companies, and prompted Democratic leaders to announce that they would draw up legislation for votes next week.
''Today's announcement of major job losses and findings from Congressional hearings from the last two days make it clear that Congress must work on a bipartisan basis to provide short-term and limited assistance to the automobile industry while it undertakes major restructuring,'' Ms. Pelosi said in a statement.
She added: ''Congress will insist that any legislation include rigorous and ongoing oversight to guarantee that taxpayers are protected and that resources are directed to ensure the long-term viability and competitiveness of the American automobile industry.''
The Senate banking committee, led by Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, began drafting legislation on Friday and staff were expected to work through the weekend. Mr. Dodd and other Democrats have proposed a strong oversight board or trustee to monitor any aid to the automakers.
''We aim to have votes next week on a responsible plan to help the millions of Americans who rely on a healthy auto industry for their livelihoods,'' the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, said in a statement on Friday evening.
''We will need support and cooperation from Republicans to determine when that vote happens and whether it will succeed,'' Mr. Reid said.
The Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, said Friday he would have no comment on the Democratic proposal until after the details are released.
Some conservative House Republicans have called for allowing one or more of the auto companies to enter bankruptcy.
''It's fair to say the jobs report, the disastrous jobs report, has heightened the interest to do something,'' said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, after leading a hearing on Friday on the auto companies' request for aid.
A compromise on how to help the troubled automakers had proved elusive since G.M., Ford and Chrysler came to Washington last month to plea for aid.
The hearings in mid-November were disastrous for the Big Three, as their chiefs were criticized for flying in on private jets and failing to bring plans to make their struggling companies viable for the long term.
The tone was noticeably different at this week's hearings.
G.M. is seeking $18 billion in loans, but says it needs $4 billion immediately to survive past the year. Chrysler, which is also running out of cash, wants $7 billion. Ford, the healthiest of the three, is asking for a $9 billion line of credit.

HEADLINE: With Eye on Profits, G.M. Began Missing on Innovation

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley and Bill Vlasic contributed reporting.

 BODY:
General Motors did not apologize for anything in its first trip to Congress more than two weeks ago to plead for a federal rescue. The company's only problem, it insisted, was the current financial crisis.
''What exposes us to failure now is not our product lineup, or our business plan, or our long-term strategy,'' Rick Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive, said in his testimony.
On its return visit to a skeptical Congress this week, however, General Motors bowed its head. ''G.M. has made mistakes in the past,'' Mr. Wagoner told Congress, and named three: agreeing to expensive union contracts, not investing enough in smaller cars and failing to convert its plants so they could build more than one type of vehicle.
It was an unusual concession from a company that has rarely felt the need to apologize for anything, given its bragging rights as the world's largest automaker with operations in 35 countries, and as a company that has built 445 million vehicles and sat atop corporate America for much of its 100-year history. 
But the mistakes Mr. Wagoner acknowledged do not begin to explain why General Motors finds itself on the brink of insolvency, begging Congress for financial help.
G.M.'s biggest failing, reflected in a clear pattern over recent decades, has been its inability to strike a balance between those inside the company who pushed for innovation ahead of the curve, and the finance executives who worried more about returns on investment.
The two views were rarely in sync -- in effect, fighting over the steering wheel that controlled G.M.'s direction -- and the internal battles distracted G.M. from spotting shifts in the marketplace.
Time and again over the last 30 years, G.M. has spent billions of dollars on innovative ideas like its Saturn small-car company in the 1980s and the EV1 electric vehicle in the 1990s, only to then deprive those projects of further financing because money was needed elsewhere or because they were not delivering enough profit.
The failure is frustrating to those who remember the high value placed on innovation by legendary company leaders like Alfred P. Sloan Jr. and Charles E. Wilson, who felt G.M. could sell cars to the masses by demonstrating it was out in front.
''Until the 1960s, innovation was part of G.M.'s DNA,'' said John Casesa, a veteran industry analyst with the Casesa Shapiro Group. ''Now, it's a matter of trying to play catch-up.''
One such area is hybrid technology, an area where G.M. might be leading if it had encouraged the engineers who led its hybrid development as long ago as the 1970s, and continued building on expertise it gained with the EV1.
While Toyota has sold more than 600,000 Prius hybrids in the United States since 2000, General Motors will not start selling its Volt plug-in hybrid until 2010, when it hopes to sell 10,000 of them in the first year.
''We were late on hybrids,'' George M. C. Fisher, the lead outside director on G.M.'s board, said in an interview this week. ''Why were we late? We made a business decision as opposed to a marketing decision. That's probably a mistake, in retrospect.''
Another, as Mr. Wagoner said last week, was its slow reaction to greater demand for smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles. Although more are on the way, the only small car in its vast lineup of models to compete with the likes of the Honda Fit and the Toyota Yaris is the Chevrolet Aveo, a car made in Korea by G.M.'s Daewoo subsidiary.
General Motors has tried to answer the call for greater fuel efficiency in the short run by outfitting some of its pickups, big S.U.V.'s and larger cars with hybrid-electric engines, but they have not caught on with consumers.
In the early 1990s, the company lagged Chrysler's Jeep and Ford by five years in bringing an S.U.V. to market with mass appeal. Once it had ramped up its offerings, G.M. was reluctant to shift from big profitable vehicles to building small, less profitable cars, even when gas prices spiked.
By contrast, Ford, which also minted profits on a lineup heavy with S.U.V.'s, shifted its lineup faster to cars, although it still does not have one that can compete directly with the Fit and Yaris.
''We would have been chastised the other way if we had missed that opportunity,'' said Mr. Fisher, referring to its decision to focus so many resources on producing S.U.V.'s. ''Giving consumers what they want is not a bad business decision.''
Indeed, that approach worked well for G.M. for decades.
Its strategy of offering consumers an array of brands and choices, like the 70 different models across eight separate brands that it sells now, was meant to fulfill the goal set by its legendary chairman, Alfred P. Sloan, to offer a ''a car for every purse and purpose.''
(The idea was meant to contrast with Henry Ford's quip that a consumer could have any color he wanted, ''as long as it's black.'')
G.M. executives have long defended the myriad choices as necessary to defend the company's turf in a market crowded with competition both from across town as well as overseas. Likewise, its bet was always that G.M., with its enormous marketing and research and development budget, could afford to offer such options.
Only now, in its second plea to Congress, did it acknowledge what just about every industry analyst has said for years: that G.M. has too many brands, now that its market share has fallen by nearly two-thirds from its peak in 1960 to just 22 percent today.
G.M. said last week that it would focus on just four core brands -- Chevrolet, Buick, GMC and Cadillac -- and sell or play down Saturn, Pontiac, Saab and Hummer.
The goal, it said in its new plan, is ''to focus available resources and growth strategies on the company's profitable operations.''
That may sound like an obvious strategy for any car company, but the automobile industry, like the aviation business, involves bets of billions of dollars that may not pay off for years, if at all.
For those willing to gamble and to follow through on their bets -- like Chrysler did with minivans, like Toyota did with Prius and as Honda has done with its focus on fuel efficiency even when gas was cheap -- the payoff in sales and reputation can be enormous.
But G.M., despite its tradition of fostering innovation, has often been impatient for profits to emerge.
Mr. Casesa said that pattern stemmed from the fact that so many of the company's top executives had a background in finance, not in engineering and designing cars and trucks.
For the last half-century, virtually all of G.M.'s chief executives, including Mr. Wagoner, have come from its financial side, which has judged most initiatives based on whether they will be profitable.
That ''earn it'' philosophy has led to the demise of some of G.M.'s most publicized efforts to try something new, like the EV1 electric car, which G.M. leased to owners from 1996 to 1999, before killing the program as too expensive.
It also led G.M. not to introduce any new Saturn models for five years during the 1990s, effectively starving the division of new products that might have lured in new customers.
By contrast, Toyota lost money for years on Prius, which never caught on in Japan until Toyota halved its price. Likewise, Prius might have remained a cult car in the United States had gas prices remained low. But Prius sold out once prices topped $3 a gallon, and gave Toyota political cover when it introduced the big Tundra pickup truck in 2007.
Worries over profits has also stifled innovation at G.M. Engineers actually started work on minivans a decade before Chrysler popularized them in the 1980s, said David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich., and the son of a former G.M. president, who has advised G.M. for years. But G.M.'s finance staff refused to give the go-ahead.
''They looked at it and thought, 'Why would people need minivans if they had station wagons?' '' Mr. Cole said. After Chrysler's vans were a big hit, G.M. tried to capture attention in the early 1990s with a series of slope-nosed vans derided as ''Dustbusters'' that failed to sell well. After other attempts, General Motors stopped selling minivans this year.
G.M.'s failure to press forward with its own hybrids was a deep disappointment to Robert C. Stempel, the former chief executive who gave the go-ahead to the EV1 program during his brief tenure in the early 1990s.
''I'm furious,'' Mr. Stempel said in a 2003 interview. ''G.M. had the technology. The lead was there. I know it.''
This week, Mr. Wagoner told Congress that G.M. would innovate once more, this time in the hope of securing some sort of aid. The company's restructuring plan, he said, is ''a blueprint for creating a new General Motors, one that is lean, profitable, self-sustaining and fully committed to product excellence and technology leadership.''
This new blueprint undoubtedly was not what Mr. Wagoner had in mind less than three months ago, when he stood before hundreds of employees and executives to mark G.M.'s centennial.
''What's our assignment for today and tomorrow?'' Mr. Wagoner asked, and then provided the answer. ''Above all, it's to demonstrate to the world that we are more than a 100-year-old company. We're a company that's ready to lead for 100 years to come.''
Now the question is whether G.M. will make it to its 101st birthday as a solvent company.

HEADLINE: 300,000 Apply for 3,300 Obama Jobs

BYLINE: By NEIL A. LEWIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Brenda Benton, a veteran media relations employee with the Los Angeles Police Department, is now part of a record-breaking political phenomenon. 
 Ms. Benton was so thrilled with the election of Barack Obama as president that she has become one of about 300,000 people who have, so far, put themselves forward for posts in the new administration. At the equivalent time in the George W. Bush transition eight years ago, with his election still in dispute, there were about 44,000 applicants, according to Clay Johnson, who led the Bush transition effort. Mr. Johnson said the final figure was about 90,000.
 In 1968, President-elect Richard M. Nixon's aides were so uncertain about the availability and willingness of people to take administration jobs that they sent more than 70,000 letters to everyone listed in Who's Who in America, asking for names of potential federal appointees. 
 But that is surely not a problem at Obama transition headquarters in Washington, where more than 50 staff aides have been busily classifying and downloading resumes into a computer system that lists applicants' special skills and, one official said, what notable political sponsors they might have. 
 The excitement about an Obama administration along with the cyclical pent-up eagerness of Democrats denied the employment bounty of the executive branch for eight years has fueled the surge, although the unraveling economy may be adding its own boost.
 The presidential historian Michael R. Beschloss said that ''it's hard to find a parallel in modern times to this degree of enthusiasm for going into government,'' all the more striking in a period previously known for cynicism about government employment.
 Ms. Benton, an African-American who is well-known in Los Angeles political circles, said she would love to work in some way for the future first lady, Michelle Obama, because she is greatly impressed ''with her style and the dignified way she handles situations.'' Ms. Benton has sent her resume to www.change.gov, the transition clearinghouse, and has begun thinking about who she knows who could put in a good word. 
 Obama officials have said they might have more than double their current number of applications by Inauguration Day. ''There are a lot of people who want to work in the administration,'' David Axelrod, a senior Obama aide, exulted to reporters this week. ''That's great. That's great for the country.''
 But not necessarily great for the job seekers because there are actually only about 3,300 positions an incoming administration gets to fill. That means that despite the appealing notion of hordes of eager newcomers swarming to change Washington, the vast majority of those seeking jobs will be disappointed. 
 Mr. Johnson, who is now deputy director for management at the Office and Management and Budget, said most people were stunned to learn that the percentage of politically appointed employees in the federal government is so small, a mere 0.17 percent of the civilian work force of 1.9 million. 
 Mr. Johnson, who is well regarded by Republicans and Democrats alike for his expertise about federal employment issues, said that there were about 1,000 senior positions in the federal agencies that required Senate confirmation. These are typically positions like assistant, deputy and under secretary.
 In addition there are 8,000 senior bureaucrats in what is called the Senior Executive Service and by law, no more than 10 percent, or 800, of these managerial positions may be filled by political appointees. Finally, he said, an administration has some 1,500 jobs to fill, known as Schedule C slots, with salaries ranging from about $25,000 to $150,000. The lower end of this scale are those jobs that people traditionally think of as political slots -- suitable, say, for some party leader's niece who just graduated from college.
 (That adds up to 3,300, not including hundreds of federal judges, diplomats and members of boards and commissions.)
 ''To have one or two political appointees for every thousand employees is not unreasonable,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''It's actually a minimal number given that every new administration wants to bring its own initiatives and needs a fresh set of people committed to those new policies.''
 The long odds of landing a position have probably contributed to the frenzy of job seekers trying to gain whatever advantage they can.
 One person involved in the Obama campaign said she had been contacted for help on behalf of someone who was three degrees removed -- a friend of a relative of a friend. The Obama person spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying that to do otherwise, or to name names, would simply embarrass all concerned.
 Another Obama supporter, a prolific fund-raiser, said that he had forwarded dozens of names to the Obama transition office although he acknowledged that he still found the sorting and hiring process mysterious.
 ''I believe that those who actually make the decisions on hiring are part of a relatively tightly held group,'' he said, but job seekers inevitably go to the most visible supporters to seek help.
 He also spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying he hoped to reduce the number of supplicants coming his way.
 Another route for applicants is to begin with an elected Democratic official. Aides to Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said they had, so far, about 100 requests to forward expressions of interest in jobs at all levels of government. Mr. Schumer himself added another explanation for the flood of job seekers: Democrats, he said, are more likely to believe in the power of government to improve things.
 The situation of job seekers is further complicated by what seems to be the unresolved issue, chronic to many administrations, as to whether hiring decisions in federal departments will be made by the cabinet secretaries themselves or the White House.

HEADLINE: Is That Opportunity Knocking?

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
BANKS have certainly fallen on hard times, but perhaps not quite as hard as a lot of people think. The latest report from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shows that the industry earned $1.7 billion in the third quarter, even after writing off more than $50 billion in bad loans.
 The agency did not exactly paint a rosy picture. Even so, the F.D.I.C. deals only with deposit-taking institutions, not investment banks, several of which, like Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, have failed or come close. 
 The profit cited in the report is also very thin, 94 percent less than in the same quarter of 2007. And the recent figure does not include about $2 billion of losses accumulated by Washington Mutual before it was snatched from oblivion by JPMorgan Chase just before the quarter ended.
 Earnings can erode further or vanish as the recession deepens, too. But there is no sign yet of anything like the repeated quarterly losses of the savings and loan crisis of the early 1990s.
 As difficult as conditions are for the industry, such resilience and continued profitability may surprise many who have read the relentlessly glum headlines about the financial system. Could it be that the main development driving share prices down further is not banks' weakness but investors' bleakness?
 ''There is a terrible tendency to over-extrapolate trends,'' said Alan Brown, group chief investment officer for Schroder Investment Management. ''People think earnings will grow forever or collapse to zero.''
 He is not one of those people. He expects earnings to fall by half during the recession before rebounding. Even with such a drop, and even if dividends are cut by up to a third, he said, stocks have sunk so far that they are ''extraordinarily cheap.''
 He may be wrong. Earnings can always fall by more than half -- they fell 70 percent during the Great Depression -- and stocks can keep going lower. Anything is possible. But Mr. Brown's readings of history and investor psychology persuade him to bet on a rebound instead.
 ''There is very real value'' in parts of the stock market, he said. ''People should be dusting off their checkbooks and putting money in month after month.''
 If investors are to undergo an attitude adjustment that persuades them to buy, the catalyst could be a shift in focus to what is right with the banking system instead of what is wrong.
 Mr. Brown pointed to widespread consternation over the enormous potential liability that the government had assumed by taking bad debt off banks' hands or injecting capital directly. The positive side, he said, is that banks have vast amounts of money to lend when they regain the confidence to do so.
 One development that could embolden the industry is a change in rules governing how banks value assets on their books. Ron Muhlenkamp, a manager of value-stock portfolios, expects regulators to move to a system where valuations are less sensitive to day-to-day price fluctuations but provide better estimates of long-term worth.
 THAT should increase lending and give a lift to share prices in banking, he said. When the rules change, ''the lead weight comes off financials and all of a sudden they'll resurrect pretty quickly,'' he predicted.
 He has been buying Bank of America shares and recommends other big banks that have received government aid, the ones apparently deemed too big to fail, including JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.
 Mr. Muhlenkamp finds value throughout the stock market, especially in technology blue chips like I.B.M., Cisco Systems and Oracle, which are ''cheaper than we've seen in a generation.'' His selections elsewhere include the UnitedHealth Group, 3M and General Electric.
 Selling has been so indiscriminate in his view that even businesses like these have been cut to extreme bargain prices. When the gloom abates, he expects them to lead the way higher.
 ''We're seeing great companies selling dirt cheap,'' he said. ''You don't have to go Dumpster diving to find values. They're staring at you.''

HEADLINE: It's All About the Beer, and Independence

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE

 BODY:
WHEN Jim Koch, a sixth-generation brewer, started Boston Beer Company in 1984 with an old family recipe, he was one of a few pioneering craft brewers in a field dominated by Miller, Budweiser and Coors. 
 Now, a wave of consolidation has radically altered the brewing landscape. In November, shareholders of Anheuser-Busch agreed to a $52 billion acquisition by the Belgium-based InBev, creating the world's largest beer maker (now called Anheuser-Busch InBev). That follows the merger in July of the United States operations of SABMiller, with roots in South Africa, with Molson Coors Brewing Company (itself a merger of Molson Inc. of Canada and Adolph Coors Company of Colorado), into a new entity called MillerCoors.
 With less than 1 percent of beer sales in the United States, Boston Beer is now the nation's leading independent brewer. 
 In addition to its signature Sam Adams lager, Boston Beer produces more than 21 types of beer, including seasonal ales, Chocolate Bock and Utopias, a beer aged in oak barrels that sells for $140 for a 24-ounce bottle. Still, the company has struggled in recent months to manage a voluntary recall because of defects in bottles from one of its suppliers, the acquisition of a new brewery and a broadening economic slowdown.
 Mr. Koch recently discussed the beer market. 
 Q.It's an interesting time in the beer market, wouldn't you say?
 A. There has probably been more change in the last four months than at any time since Prohibition. Ninety-five percent of the beer made in the United States is controlled by two companies, one based in Belgium and one in South Africa. It's stunning. 
 Q.How does it feel to be the country's largest independent brewer?
 A. It's bizarre and sad. It's a little like your kid's Little League team winning the World Series because no one else showed up. 
 Q.How have things changed since the early days of the craft brew movement?
 A. For years, craft beers were a largely ignored curiosity in American beer. When I started Sam Adams, beer drinkers had two choices: mass-produced domestic beer that was consistent and well made -- the equiv of fast food -- or imports. The mentality of beer was completely different. No one thought about beer as having quality differences. 
 Over time, Sam Adams and the whole craft movement began to slowly change the way Americans think about their own beer. Today, the center of creativity and quality in brewing has migrated from Europe to the United States. 
 Q.And now, there are 1,400 craft brewers in the United States?
 A. Yes. Roughly 1,000 of those are brew pubs, while others are making some of the most interesting beer around. 
 Q.Does the competition worry you?
 A. No. Beer is where wine was 25 years ago. We are at the beginning of an explosion in interest in beer. There's a generation of beer drinkers who have grown up expecting to get great beer. They are really driving the market. Sam Adams is starting to become available in places that it was never was, like convenience stores. We are growing in Wal-Mart. 
 Q.When you're the No. 1 brewer, and you're in Wal-Mart, do you worry that that takes away from your pioneer craft beer image?
 A. There will always be people looking for novelty and obscurity. I'm not trying to be obscure. I'm trying to change the way Americans think about beer. 
 Q.Boston Beer reported worse-than-expected third-quarter results and lowered the outlook for 2009. What happened?
 A. Sales were actually a little better than expected. We had a number of accounting charges. One of them was some residual charges from the recall back in April. We thought we closed the books on it and then we got the last bit of beer back from our wholesalers. And we had to accelerate the shortfall fees we pay to other breweries as we ramped up our new brewery in Pennsylvania, and there were some things with the tax rate. 
 The thing that I'm most worried about is what we call depletions -- the beer that got shipped out of wholesalers to retailers. It's the closest proxy we have to how much beer people drink. That was up 12 percent, compared to 10 percent last quarter. But it's really more a continuation of the trend.
 Q.Consumers have been cutting back on all kinds of discretionary spending. Has that included beer?
 A. We haven't seen that happening yet. Beer as a category is recession-resistant -- nothing's recession-proof. A quality beer is a very affordable luxury. People will cut back on a lot of things before they give up on something that's so affordable. But we don't know. We're looking week by week at whether the economic situation is going to affect our drinkers. I was at an account in Philadelphia the other day. He said what's really been hurt is the high-end margarita. They're not buying the luxury vodkas.
 Q. Are people buying more beer at the store and drinking it at home?
 A. You bet. And that kind of benefits Sam Adams. That's one of the very democratic things about beer. If you are a wine connoisseur and want to experience a world-class wine, it's going to cost you around $100.
 Q.There's a lot of experimentation in brewing lately. Tell me about your extreme beer.
 A. Extreme beer was a term I coined back in 1994 to describe a beer we had invented called Triple Bock. It was the beer equivalent of extreme sports: 35 proof, 17 percent alcohol. At that level of alcohol, there's no longer carbonation. It didn't taste like a beer. It tastes like a tawny port, maybe with some old sherry notes, and a bit of that savory character came from the yeast. It has evolved into Utopias. The boundaries of beer are much farther out than people realize. Extreme beer is brewers' way of pushing those boundaries.

HEADLINE: Paulson's China Trip Leaves Big Issues Unresolved

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS; Zhang Jing contributed research.

DATELINE: BEIJING 

 BODY:
There was an agreement to make it easier for foreign banks to trade bonds in China. There were memorandums on energy conservation. And there was the creation of a formal partnership to encourage a Kansas town shattered by a tornado to share green reconstruction methods with an earthquake-devastated city in Sichuan Province.
 For Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., the two days of economic dialogue with Chinese officials that ended Friday produced a modest stream of achievements, including pledges by both nations to spend $20 billion to help finance trade in developing countries. 
 Even if the marquee economic conference that Mr. Paulson helped establish in 2006 was supposed to be more about big ideas and less about deliverables, the pressure to come up with tangible successes has been hard to resist.
 This year was no exception, and the jointly issued ''fact sheet'' listed five pages of agreements on issues like forest management, food safety, plug-in hybrid cars and offshore wind farms.
 But the United States-China Strategic Economic Dialogue, as it is called, also left many large issues unresolved and served to highlight tensions between the world's biggest economy and the world's largest developing one.
 For the Americans, they include efforts to open China's financial sector to United States securities firms and longstanding tensions over government control of the yuan, whose weakness against the dollar has contributed to a yawning trade gap between the two countries.
 For the Chinese, there were oblique criticisms that America's profligate ways had sent the global economy into a tailspin and threatened China's stability. Largely unspoken is the fact that the Chinese government has become the largest holder of United States Treasury securities, with about $600 billion of China's savings invested in American debt.
 ''The important reasons for the U.S. financial crisis include excessive consumption and high leverage,'' Zhou Xiaochuan, governor of China's central bank, said in a statement. ''The United States should speed up domestic adjustment, raise its savings rate and reduce its trade and fiscal deficits.'' 
 Wang Qishan, China's deputy prime minister, was more blunt: The United States, he said, should stabilize its economy as soon as possible to ''ensure the safety of China's assets and investments in the U.S.''
 In his public comments, Mr. Paulson was careful not to criticize the Chinese about their resistance to a currency overhaul, although at a time when both countries are grappling with enormous economic pressures, the yuan's sudden 1 percent drop against the dollar Monday could not have helped lighten the mood.
 Although it is largely conjecture, some economists say China's government is intentionally pushing down its currency, a move that would help Chinese exporters by lowering prices on goods they sell overseas. Others have suggested the downward swing the last week was aimed at warning the United States against pushing China too hard on trade, currency and other economic issues.
 Mr. Paulson would not take the bait offered by reporters, saying that China had made strides on the currency question in recent years, although more progress was needed. ''The Chinese understand, as do we, how important currency reform is to balanced growth in China,'' he said.
 This will be Mr. Paulson's fifth and final conference, and it remains to be seen whether the Obama administration will continue the meetings.
 Although Mr. Paulson started the talks partly as a way to soothe Congressional fury over the exchange-rate issue, the forum quickly became a catch-all venue for a range of issues frustrating American trade negotiators.
 In an interview after the conference, Mr. Paulson suggested that people should not judge the forum by bullet-point achievements but by its role in fostering economic dialogue between high-ranking officials in both governments.
 He said the meetings -- which this year included Stephen L. Johnson, the Environmental Protection Agency administrator; Elaine L. Chao, the labor secretary; and Michael O. Leavitt, the health and human services secretary -- had always been refreshingly candid. ''People aren't just making speeches to appeal to the other members of their team that are there,'' he said.
 Sitting in an armchair and sipping a Diet Coke, Mr. Paulson made an appeal for the dialogue to continue. ''This is something that works,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Q. & a. With Larry Ellison

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLEARY

 BODY:
Excerpts from an interview this week with Larry Ellison, owner of the sailing team BMW Oracle Racing. Ellison, the American software billionaire, is involved in a legal dispute with the defender of the America's Cup, Alinghi, and its owner, Ernesto Bertarelli. Ellison spoke with Christopher Clarey of The International Herald Tribune.
 Q. Your lawsuit is still pending. But what do you make of the collective agreements Alinghi is trying to reach in Switzerland with teams that are entered in the proposed next phase of the competition in 2010? Do you give the process much credence and do you feel they have made progress on some of your points of contention? 
 A. There are two kinds of teams. Terrible things have happened. Because of our lawsuit, a lot of teams are unable to sell and come up with sponsors because there is no date for the next America's Cup, and there is all this uncertainty. And I put this all on Ernesto's doorstep because he created this ridiculous bogus yacht club and because they had these horribly one-sided rules where only Ernesto had a chance to win, and we sued as a response. And now all these teams are up in the air. They can't get sponsors, and they are a little bit desperate to get this solved, and we'd like to get it solved, too. Some of these teams have no chance to win, so I don't think it's so important to them or perhaps it's not so important to them or they're not afraid that Ernesto is going to invoke his ''we can change the rules whenever we want to'' rule, or ''we can dismiss any competitor whenever we want to'' rule. Ernesto is not likely to use that on them. He's likely to use that on us, so we're in a bit of a different situation than some of these other teams, and we don't really trust him.
 Q. What would help you trust him?
 A. All he has to do is go back and say, Let's go back to the rules of the last Cup.
 Q. Are you at ease with the prospect that if you lose this court case you are out of the America's Cup?
 A. If we lose the case, I think the Cup is in a lot of trouble, because what it means is and their position is: the challenger of record could be anybody. It could be a gas station. It could be Ernesto's cousin. It basically says the challenger of record could be whoever you want. Their position is, it has to be a yacht club in name only, so you could be the challenger of record. You could create something called myyachtclub.com and you could be the challenger of record. You have no yachts, no members, but you're an organization and you challenge. You don't have to have an annual regatta yet. They say having an annual regatta means sometime in the future, any time in the future, so you could become the challenger of record. And suddenly what it means is, anyone can be the challenger of record and since it's anybody, you could get one-sided rules. I would guess under those circumstances Ernesto would hold the America's Cup forever because he'd be allowed to have whatever. He could go back to his old protocol. Right?
 Q. So you still feel like you're playing the white knight, fighting for a higher cause, even though you haven't won the right to defend the Cup on the water and even though you've taken some public relations hits?
 A. Well, Russell Coutts has won the Cup on the water three times, so there are a lot of guys on our team who have won the Cup. So, in fact, our guys have won the Cup more than Ernesto has won the Cup and, in fact, our guys, one of our guys, made it possible for Ernesto to win the Cup in the first place. And this isn't my decision alone. It's my decision taken with Russell and the other guys, and we just feel if the court decides the challenger of record can be anything: a two-day-old organization, a yacht club in name only, no members, no boats, no regattas, no nothing, then what does that leave us with? So I think it's kind of the end of the America's Cup as we know it. Ernesto can go back to his own protocol where all the umpires work for him, the jury works for him, and go back to his original idea, and maybe he can even have a rule where he races in a special boat. His boat can have a motor. 
 Q. The world economy has gone rotten, sponsorship is tough. The Cup was not in a great place before this began because of the legal battle between your team and Alinghi, but now it seems to be in a worse place. How do you feel personally about the fallout from all this?
 A. I feel terrible. I'm about to head out to the Canary Islands. My sailing, I'm on the pro match racing circuit on the RC44s. But we haven't been doing any America's Cup racing or really driving big boats. I've been racing small boats. Everyone has the same RC44, and I've been on that circuit this year, and I'm enjoying that. But I'd love to get the America's Cup out of the court room, to use the cliche, and back on the water. But that's impossible unless we get a fair set of rules. When I'm racing against Ben Ainslie or Jimmy Spithill or one of these guys in the RC44, I know the rules are the same for both of us. Racing Ernesto, there's one set of rules for Ernesto, one set of rules for the rest of us. 
 Q. Despite building this big beast of a trimaran, do you still want to see this resolved and the Cup staged in a conventional manner with multiple challengers in monohulls instead of getting the chance to race the trimaran against Alinghi in a Deed of Gift match?
 A. I have mixed feelings about that. I think it would be an awful lot of fun to race the multihull. Scary, but fun. And I think in some ways it would be good for the sport, because it would bring extreme sailing to the public. They'd see the boats just capable of enormous speeds dueling it out, so I think it would be a wonderful television spectacle. On the other hand, I prefer having a conventional Cup with rules that are fair for everybody.
 Q. Have you driven the trimaran?
 A. Yes. It's strange. I don't know how else to describe it. The boat at least to me doesn't have a lot of feel in the wheel. I'm looking at the hulls and how much they are flying, and I'm looking at all the gauges and all of that, but it doesn't have a lot of feel. I haven't driven it that much, and Jimmy Spithill says after a while he has got some feel on it, has a bit of feel in his hands. And I'm used to driving not only by looking at instruments, which I look at very closely, and looking at wind conditions and looking for puffs and all that. But I also expect some feedback from the wheel, which I don't get from that boat, so I found it very challenging to drive and, of course, I was only driving in 10 knots of breeze. I can't even imagine what it would be like to drive that thing in 30.

HEADLINE: Where the Cuts of Meat, And the Prices, Are Defiantly Decadent

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE LYNESS

 BODY:
THERE'S something surreal about dining at Craftsteak, Tom Colicchio's high-end steakhouse at MGM Grand at Foxwoods casino. 
 It's not just the chirping and clanging of the slot machines that greet us as we exit the elevator on our way to the restaurant. Nor, once seated at our cushy leather booth, is it the menu prices, which far exceed what we expect to pay for haute cuisine in Connecticut.
 What takes the experience over the top is the odd juxtaposition of extravagant spending and this grim moment of economic meltdown: it's a Saturday night, and the hangar-sized room is packed with folks tucking into steaks that start at $38 and rise steeply from there to a wagyu strip at $30 an ounce (four-ounce minimum). 
 Mr. Colicchio is a superstar on the American culinary scene, and his elegant style of comfort food, showcasing exquisite, seasonal and locally sourced ingredients, has helped redefine haute cuisine in America. His influence extends beyond that, too; television viewers know Mr. Colicchio as the head judge on Bravo's popular cooking show ''Top Chef.'' 
 Mr. Colicchio made his name in the mid-1990s with his partner, Danny Meyer, at Gramercy Tavern in New York City. In 2001, he opened his own place, Craft, around the corner from Gramercy. The prolific Craft empire soon sired a number of other restaurants, as well as Mr. Colicchio's homage to the American steak house, which he calls Craftsteak. (Foxwoods is the third Craftsteak location, with others in Las Vegas and Manhattan.) 
 With the opening of MGM Grand in May of this year -- flaunting, in addition to Craftsteak, Chef David Burke's steakhouse (David Burke Prime) -- Foxwoods seems to be stepping up its game. 
 Part of the draw of casino culture is the promise of luxurious, even decadent adventure, with a concordant price tag. The question is, then, are those steaks worth all that money? 
 Yes, and no. 
 Craftsteak's menu offers three types of steak: corn-fed, grass-fed and, when I was there, Australian and American raised wagyu (wagyu refers to a type of cattle known for its densely marbled meat). 
 Cowed by the prices, we ordered the least expensive wagyu, a skirt steak ($69). Tender, buttery, with big, round beef flavor -- I can say unequivocally that this is the best steak I've ever eaten. 
 At $55, a 28-day dry-aged New York strip was excellent. By contrast, however, the flavor of a 28-day dry-aged, corn-fed rib-eye ($69) was disappointing, and its texture chewy. 
 In the dim lighting, we failed to notice that the grass-fed, flat iron steak on the menu was bison, rather than beef. Its gamey flavor was lovely but it was slightly overcooked (it was the only piece of meat I ate here that was less than perfectly cooked).
 The best of the appetizers was a plate of three plump, and beautifully cooked, local (Stonington) scallops, with honey and black truffle. Five small slices of raw, yellowfin tuna, seasoned with lemon, were tasty, but at $21, they deserved to have been more chilled. Local (Noank) oysters and clams were appropriately bright and fresh tasting, if terribly expensive at $3 to $4 apiece. Kuri squash soup was sweet -- not my style -- and ought to have been thinned.
 Sides are a la carte, as is traditional at steak houses. For the most part, the kitchen did a fine job but because of the prices, I feel obliged to quibble: the French fries might have been crisper, and they were overly browned. Sauteed mushrooms were a little dry, and a pumpkin risotto, which was both too rich and undercooked (the interior of the rice chalky), was frankly disappointing. Sauteed Swiss chard, however, was delicious, and the shallow, golden-crusted spinach gratin was lightly creamed, not drowned in white sauce as is too often the case.
 The kitchen also does a nice job with its yeasted breads, as we discovered when we ordered two for dessert: the monkey bread and doughnut holes. Both were as expertly made as the warm, buttery dinner rolls that kicked off the evening. The monkey bread (a standard on the Craft menu), a buttery spiral of brioche layered with caramel and garnished with pecans and whipped creme fraiche, was a wonderful thing. Doughnut holes were warm and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar. 
 Astonished by the cost of the meal, I returned a second time to see whether I might be able to construct a less expensive, nonsteak meal. My companion and I split two salads -- Caesar, and a lemon-and-Kalamata dressed calamari salad -- before tasting the braised short ribs (another Colicchio classic) and roasted wild king salmon. 
 Served with an expertly made Parmesan crisp, the Caesar was very good; in the squid salad, the mild taste of the seafood disappeared under the strong flavor of the olives. Short ribs were appropriately tender and luscious, and the salmon well cooked. And this time, the fries were crisped to perfection.
 Warm peanut butter chocolate fondant for dessert was more chocolatey than peanut, but was no less tasty for that. I loved the topping on my individual apple-cranberry crisp, but left the undercooked apples uneaten. 
 Even steakless, the meal was very expensive. Salads, sides and dessert portions, however, are large enough to split easily. 
 In a phone call with the Craftsteak general manager, Tom Timmons, I discovered that it's likely that some of the guests on that Saturday night were eating on their dream cards, a system by which points accrued during gambling can be redeemed at casino restaurants. For the rest of us, if you want the steak of your dreams, you'll have to pay for it.

HEADLINE: Too Much of a Reach?

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL. 
E-mail: bigdeal@nytimes.com

 BODY:
TO those who say it can't happen here, Joshua Kahr, the founder of Kahr Real Estate Services, an advisory firm, offered some sobering thoughts on the potential collapse of the Manhattan real estate market in a recent newsletter. He recently visited Hong Kong, Singapore, Calgary, Miami, Phoenix, Denver and Washington. 
''In every single one of those markets,'' he said, ''the locals will give you their reasons why their market won't be as affected as much by the global credit meltdown as everyone else's will be. Unfortunately, they can't all be right. Research has shown that everyone thinks that they are better than average.''
Mr. Kahr provides an illustration, a table of Manhattan condo prices that reminds readers that it took four years, until 1993, for prices to hit bottom from the peak in 1989, and another four years for the market to claw its way back to the 1989 level.
In this context, a recent listing of a town house at 26 West 76th Street, on a leafy block just off Central Park, may be a powerful example of the audacity of hope. The asking price for the gutted and rebuilt 1890s building is $25 million, about 60 percent more than the most expensive town house ever sold on the Upper West Side.
Adam Gordon, a developer, bought the 25-foot-wide house for $5.8 million in 2006. He emptied the building of tenants, rebuilt the entrance and added Juliet balconies and a full-width four-story extension.
The building, once 13 apartments, is now a one-family elevator mansion sprawling over 10,000 square feet. According to the listing agent, Robby Browne of the Corcoran Group, it has a rooftop solarium, a wine cellar, a media room, a gym, a huge open kitchen and a glass-walled family room facing a small backyard.
''There is nothing this large at 15 Central Park West,'' Mr. Browne said, speaking of perhaps the most successful new development in recent years.
But asking prices have been cut at seven of nine apartments now on the resale market at 15 Central Park West. Most were lowered in the last month or so, and several brokers questioned whether the asking price on the town house was realistic.
The highest price on record for a town house on the West Side is $15.75 million. The property, a 26-foot-wide mansion on a 41-foot-wide lot on Riverside Drive, was sold by James B. Rogers Jr., the business commentator and investor, in December 2007.
That was the month the recession began, and the real estate outlook has not improved. Still, Mr. Browne said that the town house on West 76th Street is different. The block of graceful town houses has uncommonly good light, and few if any comparable town houses are on the market. And such a sale requires only one seller and one buyer.

HEADLINE: Fear in the Land of Vanished Auto Plants

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
E-mail: jersey@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Linden 

 BODY:
 STANDING on a cold, gray day at the locked gate he once passed through to work, George Hall surveyed the vast windswept plain of concrete and asphalt where the auto industry made its last stand in New Jersey.
 ''Nothing,'' he said, peering through the chain link at what was once a General Motors assembly plant that made almost nine million vehicles over its lifetime, bulldozed flat since August. ''Nothing left at all.'' 
 To anyone who has ever driven along this busy stretch of Routes 1 and 9 anytime over the last 70 years, it's a startling sight: 100 acres of nothing, where once sprawled a plant so busy that shifts had to be spaced an hour apart so all 5,700 workers could get in and out. The last vehicle made in the state rolled off the line in 2005, a white four-door Chevy Blazer, and New Jersey's last 1,100 autoworkers lost their jobs. Demolition started in January, and proceeded to erase the past faster than anyone expected. The street signs on the traffic lights at the front gates still say ''G.M.,'' but you can't turn into the plant any longer, only into the big-box stores across the highway that are the main industry along the corridor now. 
 As the nation weighs the fate of the auto industry -- as the Big Three chiefs returned to Washington with more dire warnings and pleas for aid -- New Jersey has already seen what happens in a collapse. Ten miles down the highway from here sits another parcel of nothing: the 97 bulldozed acres in Edison where Ford made its last vehicle in the state, a Ranger pickup, in 2004. Back at the peak in 1970, New Jersey had more than 14,000 auto workers in the kind of mortgage-paying manufacturing jobs that have been slipping away for years. Now it has only retirees worried about whether the economic earthquake will bury their pensions. 
 ''We're all connected in this mess, not just the automotive industry,'' said Mr. Hall, 53, who spent 33 years with G.M. in Linden, and whose late father, Eddie, spent 42 years there. ''This country got great through industry, but we've gotten away from what made us great, and we're seeing the effect of it.''
 Earlier in the day, Mr. Hall had gathered with several other former Linden workers at the United Auto Workers union hall in Edison, with its sobering view of the flattened Ford site, for a conversation about how things were then, and what was happening now. The hall was mostly empty, but a week before Thanksgiving it had been packed as tight as it had been at almost any time since the two plants closed. Retirees from Local 595 filled the 175 folding chairs for the monthly benefits meeting, and stood all along the back wall and down the hallway, too. At previous meetings, more than 50 would have been a crowd.
 ''I counted 22 people standing just on one side -- there must have been over 250 in all,'' said John Cardamone, 91, the last surviving charter member of Local 595. He started at Linden in 1937, the year it opened, assembling seats for Pontiacs and Oldsmobiles, and retired in 1972. ''I never thought this would happen. We couldn't make enough cars then. Nine hours a day, six days a week.''
 Local 595 still represents 2,800 G.M. retirees, and they came to the meeting because of a word they had been hearing tossed around lately: bankruptcy.
 ''Every day you're looking at the news and waiting for the hammer to fall,'' said Mike Coughlin, 58, who started working at the plant in 1976 because it paid better than any teaching job he could get with his degree from Trenton State College. ''Half of our pension could be gone. I've never been this frightened in my adult life.''
 As the debate proceeds in Washington, that's the part New Jersey is listening for: what will happen to the pensions? The jobs have long since been struck from the roster of manufacturing jobs in New Jersey, which is now down to 297,900, just 7.3 percent of the work force, from the peak of 892,500 in 1969. More than twice as many New Jerseyans now work for government, at all levels, as in manufacturing.
 ''This was a major pillar of the New Jersey economy,'' said Joseph J. Seneca, a professor of economics at Rutgers University, about the auto industry. Using numbers from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, he estimates that only 2,800 people in the state are making parts, bodies or trailers for motor vehicles, down from 7,000 in 2001, when Ford and G.M. were still open. ''The industry has really eroded rapidly over this decade and very little remains.''
 The highway between the two vanished auto plants is crowded with malls and stores -- places that sell things, rather than places that make things -- and the sites themselves are expected to host still more, the old economy giving way to the new. Stores, restaurants and a hotel are planned for the Ford site in Edison; stores and restaurants are planned along the highway frontage of the Linden site, with warehouses and industrial spaces in the rear. As the demolition crews gnawed at the Linden plant earlier this year, some former workers stopped by to watch. Others couldn't bear it.
 ''I took the back way because I couldn't look at it -- it would break my heart,'' said Linda Heicklen, 54, who lives in Linden and started at the plant in 1976.
 In the next week or two, the Linden retirees will find in their mail a Christmas present from Local 595: ''Through the Years at Linden Assembly,'' a DVD history the union assembled. There was a TV in the union hall basement, and the local president, Guy Messina, cued it up to show his fellow members the Oldsmobiles Mr. Cardamone remembers so vividly; the Grumman Wildcat fighter planes the plant made during World War II; the Cadillacs that rolled off the line in the flushest years.
 ''When you go by our plant it's just like going to a cemetery, because all you have is memories,'' said Mr. Messina, 65, who went to work at the Linden plant in 1968 after he was laid off in his hometown of Johnstown, Pa., by Bethlehem Steel, an industry that faced an earlier reckoning than the automakers. ''What has to happen is what happened after 9/11, where the country sensed that we were all one, that this is a crisis.''
 The last Blazer was coming off the line on the screen, and Mr. Messina was there, too, his hand on its hood, his head bowed. ''It still takes my breath away,'' he said as he watched, and then he switched it off.

HEADLINE: Measuring the Safety Nets of the Jobless

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
If you were recently laid off, one of the first things to do is file a claim with the state unemployment office. When you find out how much you'll be receiving, you may then want to have some instant ramen noodles or macaroni and cheese for dinner. Clearly, jobless benefits are meant to keep people from starving without making them complacent. 
 That said, some states have more generous benefits than others. States including Alabama, Arizona and Mississippi pay weekly maximum benefits of less than $250, whereas under certain circumstances Massachusetts will pay a maximum of $900 a week (according to the most recent federal data available). 
 The numbers below are not strictly parallel, because states use different formulas to calculate benefits. But they do show that even in states where the benefits are relatively high, there is a clear incentive to remove oneself quickly from the ranks of the unemployed.

HEADLINE: Audubon

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ROSEN

 BODY:
Years ago, in the first flush of newfound bird-watching enthusiasm, I signed up for an animal-drawing class at the American Museum of Natural History. As I was sketching after hours before the great illuminated animal dioramas, what I gradually discovered -- besides my lack of artistic ability -- was that the dioramas were themselves already works of art; the backgrounds were painted, of course, but the animals had been transformed by scientist-artists who didn't merely replicate the creatures' situations before they were shot but created something new. 
 These scientist-artists were in some sense the children of John James Audubon, whose stone figure appropriately stands atop the Central Park West entrance to the museum, alongside Daniel Boone, Meriwether Lewis and William Clark. Audubon is the sole artist in the group, but he is dressed like a frontiersman, leaning on a gun and presiding over the gateway to a nature museum, though he has earned an enduring place in the world of fine art as well. 
 Audubon lived in a more fluid time when science and art, amateur and professional, even theology and natural history were intimately connected. Born in 1785 in Saint-Domingue (Haiti) and raised in France, he arrived in the United States in 1803, fleeing the aftermath of the French Revolution. A love of birds followed him from the Caribbean to Europe and then to America. One of the great pleasures of AUDUBON: Early Drawings (Harvard University, $125), with its lavish reproductions and scientific notes, is that it allows us to see the naturalist turning into the artist, laboring not merely to give his birds scientific accuracy but an almost uncanny life force. 
 In his excellent introduction, Richard Rhodes, the author of a superb biography of Audubon, emphasizes the degree to which Audubon was obsessed with giving dead birds life. This was an artistic problem, but it seems to have had a quasi-mystical quality for Audubon as well. He wanted the creature, drained of life and color, to spread its wings again. (Emily Dickinson wrote that loving birds was ''economical. It saves going to heaven.'') 
 Audubon tried various strategies -- hanging the birds from the ceiling by a foot or beak with their wings spread -- though the early results were dismal until he hit on a special system: a board covered with sharpened wires in the form of a grid. He impaled the dead bird in a lifelike pose of his own devising and then transferred the bird's likeness to paper, similarly marked with a grid, to ensure proportional accuracy. 
 But Audubon, who supported himself after the failure of his dry goods business by producing speedy portraits of people (a time from which several of these drawings date), added something else to his images,a sort of human element that makes his mature work unmistakably his own. His bird drawings are vaguely anthropomorphic and yet tinged with a deeper sort of knowledge, too, that we are also birdlike. It is an artistic intuition of the understanding Darwin would later articulate. 
 Audubon was a better artist for being a scientist and a better scientist for being an artist -- he needed accurate field observations, as well as close studies of dead birds, to follow through on his plan to paint his subjects as if they were alive. There is a fine essay in the book on Audubon as scientist by Scott V. Edwards, curator of ornithology at the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, which houses the original drawings. (The story of the collection is itself told in a separate essay that, in tracing the journey of the images, captures Audubon's own travels as well as the web of patrons, friends and august institutions he came to depend on when seeking support for his masterwork, ''The Birds of America.'') 
 The book's centerpiece consists of the 116 drawings, reproduced in large format and full color, made during Audubon's first decade in the United States (though the volume includes renderings of European birds made during a visit back to France in 1805.) While this is apprentice work, and many of the birds hold the upright patient pose of a businessman sitting for a portrait, there are several drawings that carry the signature animation that became Audubon's hallmark, whether in the case of a gray catbird opening its wings or a belted kingfisher with the hairstyle and charisma of a punk rocker. 
 Perhaps it is merely a romantic projection on this viewer's part, but the birds that are now extinct, like the Carolina parakeet, or that lurk in a twilight of extinction, like the ivory-billed woodpecker, seem to burn with special vitality -- though the green of the Carolina parakeet has shifted to blue because of exposure to sunlight, and Audubon himself notes at the bottom of the page the difficulty of capturing the vital sheen of the bird. But perhaps this is only to say that Audubon's artistic struggle to bring creatures back from the brink has become, in a far more literal sense, our own.

HEADLINE: A Buyback Guarantee

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
BACK in the bad old days of the 1980's Manhattan real estate bust, families huddled for years in what had become sadly overpriced condominiums, waiting for the market to turn again and prices to rise, so that they could sell and move on without taking a huge loss. 
 Now with the market turning down again, and many gleaming new condominiums lingering on the market, the Rockrose Development Corporation has come up with a pitch to ease the fears of jittery buyers: a five-year money-back guarantee.
 At the View at EastCoast, in Long Island City, just across the East River from Manhattan, Rockrose is offering -- at least to the next batch of buyers who step up to sign contracts -- a promise to buy back apartments in five years at 110 percent of the sales price. 
 ''I believe in the product, I believe in the marketplace, I believe that value will increase and I am willing to put my money where my opinions are,'' said Kevin P. Singleton, a senior vice president at Rockrose.
 The View at EastCoast, an 18-story glass condominium tower at 4630 Center Boulevard, is the third of seven Rockrose apartment towers planned along the river in what used to be a 22-acre industrial area of Long Island City near the well-known Pepsi-Cola sign facing Manhattan. 
 The first two towers were rentals, and after apartments at the View went on the market last summer, 18 out of 184 went into contract. But then in the faltering economy sales stalled, despite the Manhattan skyline views, the 30,000-square-foot terrace and pool, the high ceilings, the white oak floors, and the quick commute on the No. 7 line.
 Now, with the building just about finished, an amendment approved by the state attorney general last month offers a five-year ''buyback guarantee'' to buyers who sign contracts before the sponsors declare the condominium plan effective (after at least 15 percent of apartments go into contract to residential buyers).
 Under the guarantee, on the fifth anniversary of the closing, buyers will have 90 days to return their apartments to Rockrose for 110 percent of the purchase price. However, the buyers will have to pay all closing costs, including transfer taxes and the sponsor's legal fees. 
 The amendment also introduces other concessions to buyers, including a mortgage contingency clause, and the possibility of five years of sponsor financing for purchase. In addition, buyers who sign up before the plan becomes effective are entitled to a free parking space for the next five years in a lot built by Rockrose just across the street.
 Once the plan is effective, and buyers begin to move in, the sponsor could continue to offer the buyback guarantee, or rent some units and gradually sell them off as the market improves. 
 But the buyer protection plan may not work for all buyers. Buyers are warned under the amendment that ''no bond or other security'' has been furnished to make sure the developers honor the pledge. 
 Instead, Mr. Singleton said, it depends on the financial strength and reputation of Rockrose, an established developer that owns and operates a network of profitable rental buildings in New York.

HEADLINE: A Flurry of Ski Deals

BYLINE: By HILARY HOWARD

 BODY:
The economy's downhill slide has prompted ski resorts to offer deals. 
 Vail Resorts, which operates Vail, Beaver Creek, Breckenridge and Keystone in Colorado and Heavenly in California and Nevada is giving a $30 dining credit per child per day for use at its on-mountain restaurants and $15 dining vouchers at participating resorts, when parents book a three-day vacation by Dec. 14 through Vail Resorts Reservations (www.snow.com). 
 RockResorts has the Holidays on Us promotion, which gives participants a free night of lodging on holidays like Christmas or New Year's, when four consecutive nights are booked by Dec. 15. (www.holidaysonus.com). 
 The Ski Stimulus Package offered by the Mirror Lake Inn in Lake Placid, N.Y., includes lodging, breakfast for two and two lift tickets for Whiteface Mountain, for $290 per night per couple (www.mirrorlakeinn.com). 
 New York State is offering several deals, including free skiing for fourth graders when they are with paying adults. And on specific weekends in January, February and March, travelers will get a third night of lodging and a third day of skiing free when they book a weekend ski and stay package at participating ski areas (www.iloveny.com). 
 And hotels in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania also have packages. The Inn at Jim Thorpe, for example, has the Ski and Stay package, which includes lodging, breakfast and a pass to either the Blue Mountain, Jack Frost or Big Boulder ski areas. Starting rates are $69 to $89 (www.poconoski.com).

HEADLINE: For New Leader of U.S.O.C., It's About More Than Games

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR

DATELINE: COSTA MESA, Calif. 

 BODY:
After a whirlwind introduction to the Olympic movement over the last two months, which included a half-dozen business trips and nearly 20 conference calls, Larry Probst has a few choice words for Peter Ueberroth, whom he replaced as the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee in October.
 ''At some point in the future, I'm going to get even with Peter Ueberroth for misrepresenting how much time this takes,'' Probst said jokingly on Friday at a committee meeting. ''He told me it was anywhere from 20 to 25 percent of his time, but it's closer to a full-time job. So he'd better be looking behind him at all times.'' 
 Probst, who stepped down last year as the chief executive of Electronic Arts, the video game publisher and distributor, lamented that he now spent less time on the golf course because so much business was at hand. (He said his handicap used to be 10 to 11.) 
 He and the committee's board have a long to-do list. 
 They must help Chicago's bid for the 2016 Summer Games, as well as iron out a deal with the International Olympic Committee over sharing television and sponsorship revenue. 
 They must also address issues surrounding a faltering economy, which has prompted the committee to cut its 2009 budget by 10 percent. Overall funding to athletes and national governing bodies will remain untouched, the group's chief executive, Jim Scherr, said Friday.
 At the same time, Probst, 58, must try to focus on the reason he was chosen as chairman: to find ways to broaden the audience for the Olympics, particularly by luring younger fans to the Games. 
 ''Larry knows how to reach those people, and that's exactly what we need to do right now to keep ourselves relevant in today's world,'' Ueberroth said at his final board meeting in October. ''In so many ways, he's the perfect man for the job.''
 Probst, who had no previous connection to the Olympic movement, said his first memories of the Games dated to when he was 10. From suburban Philadelphia, he watched the 1960 Summer Games in Rome and was mesmerized by the flamboyance of a boxer named Cassius Clay, later known as Muhammad Ali. Watching track and field, he was flabbergasted to see the sprinter Wilma Rudolph dominate. She was the first woman he had seen excel in athletic competition.
 But these days, with too many other ways to steal their attention, young people -- especially men 18 to 34, a group coveted by advertisers -- are not a guaranteed television audience for the Olympics.
 Probst is a whiz at finding ways to connect younger people to video games, but creating a bond between those people and the Olympics will not be as easy, he said.
 One of the biggest challenges is that the Olympics is a fleeting event -- a few weeks every two years -- and interest has been just as cyclical. Probst wants to change that.
 An Olympic television network is in the works, with nearly 35 of the 45 Olympic and Paralympic sports on board to offer content. 
 Scheduled to begin broadcasting in 2009, the 24-hour network will show archival footage and live events, as well as features on athletes and Olympic news. 
 Most of the network's viewers will probably be older than 35, generally the same as the Olympic audience, said Darryl Seibel, a committee spokesman. But this year, for the first time in a long time, viewership of the Summer Games rose among men 18 to 34, he said.
 He added, ''We want to do everything we can to hold on and even try to grow those fans.''
 To do that, Probst aims to integrate the TV network with an online component to entice a younger audience. He envisions an interactive, continually evolving U.S.O.C. Web site that allows users to add content. 
 ''The younger demographic, that's where they hang out, that's where they live, online and on the mobile platform,'' Probst said. ''That's how, I think, you begin to build a community and social networks around the Olympic brand and Olympic athletes.''
 The next big step would be the creation of a video game like Electronic Arts' Madden NFL, he said, but based on the Olympics. He envisions millions of people across the globe someday going head-to-head in a virtual decathlon or a 100-meter dash.
 Probst said he envisioned an online component to the game to generate continuous interest, not only when the Olympics rolled around.
 He said that 8 million to 10 million people bought Madden NFL every year and that 15 million to 20 million bought the FIFA video game in a World Cup year. So an Olympics video game could have huge potential, especially if people would pay $15 a month to play online, he said.
 But that is a long-range goal. A video game company would first have to be interested in the project, Probst said, and realize that the endeavor could cost the company $30 million to $50 million. He is not sure that Electronic Arts, of which he is still chairman, will become involved.
 The link between sports and video games is natural, he said. Although critics say that video games have contributed to the obesity problem among children in the United States, Probst begs to differ. He said the best way to learn a sport and its rules was by playing video games, then venturing outside to play the real game.
 ''If the kids are sitting in front of a TV, playing video games 8 or 10 hours a day, that's just bad parenting,'' he said.
 Scherr, who competed in freestyle wrestling at the 1988 Games, said playing video games and training to be an Olympian were not mutually exclusive. He said he played foosball and pinball while he was training for the Games.
 ''Is there a balance that parents can create for their children?'' he said. ''Sure there is.'' 
 For Probst now, balancing his own involvement in sports like golf with his role at the U.S.O.C. is tricky. 
 But, he said, just as his job in the video game industry was much more fun than his job as national accounts manager for Clorox, being chairman of the U.S.O.C. is not so bad.
 ''Look, this is a pretty cool job,'' he said with a smile. ''I think there are a whole lot of people who would line up and do this in a heartbeat.''

HEADLINE: Synecdoche

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE. 
Send comments and suggestions to: safireonlanguage@nytimes.com

 BODY:
This is that time of the year when your language maven feels the compulsion to grovel.
 ''In your article on 'Boots on the Ground,' '' e-mails Dr. David Sachar, ''did you deliberately bypass the opportunity to introduce your readership to that wonderful figure of speech, synecdoche?'' Another reader, Katherine Noone agrees: ''I noticed a synecdoche in your column (boot). When I was in elementary school, I found a book that explained the difference between metonymy and synecdoche, which time seems to have fudged. Given Kaufman's new movie, it is time for some attention to the figure of speech.'' 
 They must have forgotten my column of only 16 years ago, which explained that metonymy, pronounced muh-TAHN-uh mee, identifies a person or thing by something closely associated with it -- like ''the brass'' for high military officers, ''the crown'' for royalty and ''the suits'' for executives, usually male, and other stiffs in traditional business garb. ''Metonymy is not to be confused with synecdoche,'' I wrote in a display of trope-a-dope, ''which is pronounced correctly only in Schenectady and uses the part to refer to the whole'' like ''wheels'' for automobiles and ''head'' for cattle.
 Noone is a somebody who correctly notes the re-emergence of the synecdoche (sih-NECK-doe-key) in the punning title of a new movie directed by the Oscar-winning surrealist screenwriter Charlie Kaufman: ''Synecdoche, New York.'' Though panned in The Washington Times as ''art-house pomposity,'' Kaufman's new work -- whose hero is described as a narcissist haunted by the thought of death -- is hailed as one of the best films of the decade by Philip Kennicott of The Washington Post. That reviewer notes that ''my death is your death is her death is our death -- possibly accounting for the title, which isn't just a phonetic play on Schenectady but a speech form in which a part of something can stand for the whole.'' Headline of his review: ''Synecdoche: A Part of Life That Makes Us Whole.'' 
 Other headline writers are beginning to catch synecdochal fever. A recent article in The New York Times, datelined Rutshuru in eastern Congo, reported on ''white-collar rebels'' known as guerrilla warriors who are now trying as civilians to administer the territory they control. The rhyming headline, bordering on today's figure of speech: ''Rebels Used to Boots, Not Suits, Seek to Govern Congo.'' 
 Charlie Kaufman has taken a term of grammar that had been suffering in desuetude and put it up in metaphoric lights. The city in New York State whose name he plays upon (possibly derived from the Mohawks' word for ''near the pines'') is going through industrial hard times, but worried residents can hope to have found their avant-guardian.
 INTO THE HEADWIND
 Only a few months ago, the euphemism of choice for writers of corporate reports and economic analysts who did not want to strike fear into investors' hearts was headwind. The metaphor was breezily chosen to show that the profit picture of individual companies was quite likely to meet with economy-wide resistance. 
 Some headwind; with major financial indexes down by half, a student of Japanese and Yiddish would call it a tsunami of tsoris. My semantic error, however, in a column titled ''Toxic Bailout,'' was in writing: ''A headwind is one that is blowing in your face. It was popularized in the 1920s by pilots; 'bucking a headwind' cuts down on air speed.'' Right on the date but egregiously wrong on the definition.
 ''I'm probably the one-millionth pilot to comment on this,'' writes Bill Flemer of Princeton, N.J. (In fact, he was the 60th.) ''But what one loses when bucking a headwind is groundspeed, or forward progress over the ground.'' Isabelle Hunter of Providence, R.I., a former private pilot, notes: ''Actually a headwind increases air speed, which is the speed of the plane relative to the air it's traveling through. A headwind decreases groundspeed, the speed of the plane relative to the ground.'' Tom Morris writes: ''Gotcha! At long last! Groundspeed equals airspeed minus headwind speed.'' (Or plus tailwind speed.) John Diefenbach, in e-mail-land, adds to his correction, ''The term's use in economics is still appropriate -- you work just as hard but don't get as far!''
 O.K. If you're in the prediction dodge, blow off the euphemism headwinds. The term on the tip of financial tongues today is volatile, from the Latin volare, ''to fly.'' In the 17th century, the meaning became ''birdlike, capable of flying,'' and that ability to soar and swoop gave rise to today's primary sense of ''unexpected, dramatic movement up or down.'' But we can all cheer up, even as the economic groundspeed slows down, by recalling Francis Bacon's usage in 1626: ''The Catterpiller toward the End of Summer waxeth Volatile, and turneth to a Butterflie.''
 EMENDATION
 The Gotcha! Gang -- in this column's case, a fairly upbeat bunch of helpers -- sends in emendations as well as welcome corrections. A few months ago, I recounted a play on words that went, ''What is the question to which 9-W is the answer?''; the question is ''Do you spell your name with a V, Mr. Wagner?'' 
 In came this topper from Leonard Malkin of Troy, Mich., quoting William F. Buckley Jr. in one of his books on sailing: ''What is the question to which 'Doctor Livingstone I presume' is the answer?'' The question: ''What is your full name, Dr. Presume?''

HEADLINE: Mall Owner Struggling With Its Mortgage Bills

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

DATELINE: WAYNE 

 BODY:
 KATHERINE EKLUND was at Willowbrook Mall last week, where she was getting holiday photos of her daughters, Julia Gerbino, 5, and Catherine Gerbino, 2. Ms. Eklund said she had no idea that the owners of the mall, General Growth Properties, the second-largest shopping mall owners in the United States, were having financial problems. But she said she was not surprised. 
 Ms. Eklund, 42, of Short Hills, who frequents this mall for the Bloomingdale's store and the GapKids, figured the mall owner was in the same boat as many others in these dire times. 
 ''I would just say it's the economy,'' she said. ''I see it everywhere.''
 General Growth, a Chicago-based company that owns four New Jersey malls, including Paramus Park, Bridgewater Commons and Woodbridge Center in addition to Willowbrook, recently announced that it has hired bankruptcy lawyers. It owns 225 malls in 44 states. 
 The company received a two-week extension on $900 million in mortgage loans that were due on Monday. The company, which has announced its intentions to refinance its debt load, said it was in talks with lenders for a longer extension. 
 David Keating, a spokesman for General Growth Properties, said that the company was working with advisers to develop a comprehensive plan to generate capital. The company has announced plans to sell three of its malls on the Las Vegas strip and one in Hawaii, but Mr. Keating said the four malls in New Jersey would not be affected. 
 ''Regardless of our situation, our properties and company will continue to operate,'' he said. ''We look forward to a prosperous holiday season.''
 General Growth Properties also has debt payments of $3 billion more coming due in 2009.
 Ivan Friedman, president and chief executive of RCS Real Estate Advisors, a firm that specializes in helping retailers evaluate their real estate portfolios, and which is not advising General Growth, said that General bought the Rouse Company in 2004 for $12 billion, including its debt. He said the company is now ''caught in a credit freeze'' and is having trouble securing loans to cover debt.
 ''Nobody expected the bottom would fall out like this,'' Mr. Friedman said. 
 He added that companies often hire bankruptcy lawyers to alarm their creditors and that even if General Growth Properties did file for bankruptcy protection, shoppers would hardly notice a difference.
 ''It's not like a real bankruptcy, the malls won't just disappear,'' he said. 
 In its New Jersey locations, General Growth Properties malls are among the top property tax payers in their municipalities. 
 Patricia Flannery, mayor of Bridgewater, said that her town collects $4 million annually from Bridgewater Commons and an additional $1.2 million in revenue sharing. Because of the mall's location next to major highways, she's confident another company would buy it should General Growth Properties choose to sell.
 ''We watched the stock price fall for months, but this news did come as a surprise,'' she said. 
 Shares of General Growth Properties tumbled to about $1 recently from more than $40 during the summer. 
 Mayor John E. McCormac of Woodbridge, who said his town earns $5.6 million in property taxes from the mall, said he too was surprised by the news.
 ''Based on the status of our mall you would not know that the parent company had problems,'' he said. 
 Officials in Wayne said that the town collects more than $6.5 million in property taxes from Willowbrook, more than any other single entity. 
 Inside Willowbrook Mall some store employees have criticized General Growth for policies that they say have hurt the bottom line. Last week mall management would not allow David Levitt, 23, who owns the Easy Blue cell-phone accessory kiosk, to put up a silver Christmas tree to attract holiday shoppers, saying it was not an approved decoration.
 ''It's a bummer, it's not good for business,'' Mr. Levitt said.

THE NEWS Conservative leaders in the Episcopal Church broke away to form a rival denomination, the Anglican Church in North America, and said they would seek approval from global Anglican leaders. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The trouble in the Episcopal Church, the American branch of Anglicanism, stems mainly from a decision five years ago to ordain an openly gay bishop. Some clergy members and churchgoers who opposed the move have affiliated with more conservative bishops in Africa or Latin America, but many wanted a home-grown alternative. The schism threatens the fragile unity of the Anglican Communion, the world's third-largest Christian body.
 THE NEWSStephen Harper, the prime minister of Canada, forestalled a near-certain ouster by shutting down the country's Parliament until Jan. 26.
 BEHIND THE NEWS No Canadian leader had ever before tried such a move, and it was decried by opponents as outrageously undemocratic. Mr. Harper's party, the Conservatives, won the most seats in Parliament in the October election, but not a majority. In recent weeks, the usually fractious opposition parties found common ground in their anger over his budget proposals and plan to end public financing for political parties. They formed a coalition to force out Mr. Harper, with a no-confidence vote planned for Monday.
 THE NEWS India's minister for security matters and the chief minister of Maharashtra State, Vilasrao Deshmukh, above, resigned over public outrage at the government's handling of the Mumbai attacks and their aftermath.
 BEHIND THE NEWS The Indian security apparatus, though warned that something was brewing, proved to be inadequate to the tasks of both preventing the attacks and ending them quickly and effectively. Signs that the attacks were mounted from Pakistan by people linked to an Islamic militant group once fostered by the Pakistani military and intelligence threatened to inflame tensions that the two countries had been trying to reduce.
 THE NEWS Trying a second time to persuade Congress to bail out their industry, the chief executives of General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler ran into a wall of skepticism and anger on Capitol Hill, and even strong supporters warned them that it may not be possible to pass a bill to assist them.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Frustrated lawmakers said the automakers had waited too long to tackle deep-rooted problems -- and had fought too long against environmental and fuel economy initiatives -- to win much sympathy now. The members of Congress said they were hesitant to throw good tax money after bad. The carmakers warned of catastrophe if one of the Big Three were to fail.
 THE NEWS The Argentine cruise ship Ushuaia, carrying 89 passengers and 33 crew members, ran aground on rocks off the coast of Antarctica.
 BEHIND THE NEWS No one was reported injured on the Ushuaia, but the threat of a fuel oil spill loomed over the environmentally sensitive coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, an increasingly popular tourism destination despite its punishing climate. In November 2007, the cruise ship Explorer sank in Antarctic waters after striking an iceberg; all aboard were rescued safely, but a mile-long oil slick from the ship threatened penguin mating grounds. Both the Ushuaia and the Explorer were built specifically for polar conditions.

 BODY:
In the early 1990s, while the cool kids in the New York University dorms were listening to Nirvana and Pavement and P. J. Harvey, Gabriel Roth, a Jewish teenager from California, sat in his dorm room, night after night, listening to one obscure James Brown record after another. He listened to ''Dooley's Junkyard Dogs,'' a 45 that Brown cut in honor of a college-football team. He listened to Brown's esoteric rock version of ''Talkin' Loud and Sayin' Nothing.'' He listened to ''Gettin' Down to It,'' a collaboration between Brown and, as Roth puts it, ''these white jazz guys -- but it was really actually a cool record.'' Mostly he listened to ''Hot Pants,'' an album that largely consisted of just one chord. It was like ''some kind of strange calculus,'' Roth told me recently. ''Everybody playing one little note or one little beat. 
But the whole thing worked together.'' Roth and a friend would sit in his dorm room and listen to ''Hot Pants'' for hours on end. They'd listen to one side of the album several times in a row, and then they'd turn it over and listen to the other side. ''We would smoke weed and listen to the album,'' he told me, ''or not smoke weed and listen to the album.''
 Fifteen years later, Roth is a 34-year-old songwriter, bassist and sound engineer, as well as the somewhat-reluctant co-owner of Daptone Records, a small record label in Brooklyn. He is still a musical outsider: he says he strongly dislikes almost every pop song recorded since 1974, including one or two that bear his own imprint. What appeals to him -- what consumes him -- are dusty soul and funk records from the 1960s and early '70s. By studiously emulating these recordings, he has gained a reputation as a devoted, even obsessive, musical purist. In an age of MP3s and computer-generated sounds, he has distinguished himself by making vinyl records featuring actual musicians manipulating real-life instruments. He has rejected the music industry, and in doing so, he has aroused its interest. Stars like Jay-Z and Kanye West and corporations like JPMorgan Chase have exploited his distinctive sound to lucrative effect. The smash hit ''Rehab,'' along with five other songs from ''Back to Black,'' Amy Winehouse's top-selling album from 2007, were recorded in Roth's studio, and for a stretch of several months last year, you could hear a pumped-up version of Roth's signature style nearly everywhere you went -- your car, the deli, your nephew's bar mitzvah -- even if you had never heard of Roth. 
 The defining project of Roth's career is Sharon Jones and the Dap-Kings, a nine-piece band with a horn section, an extensive wardrobe of crisp suits and a 52-year-old lead singer (Jones) who once worked as a prison guard on Riker's Island. Like all the 30-odd artists who make up what Roth likes to call the ''Daptone family,'' the Dap-Kings are a varied bunch: black, white, Latino, young, not so young, downright seasoned. Jones, the band's dazzling frontwoman, is the most widely recognized Dap-King, but Roth is the group's undisputed leader; he writes most of their songs, plays bass and produces all their records. When he convened the group a decade ago, few people could have anticipated that an outfit of meticulous soul revivalists with an astonishingly energetic, smack-talking, 4-foot-11 middle-aged black woman for a lead singer would become one of the more celebrated indie acts in the country -- or that Roth's continuing passion for the music of James Brown would result in critical adulation, a platinum record and a Grammy Award. But mainstream success, Roth insists, was never the point. ''Our goal is simple,'' he told me. ''We want to make the kinds of records we want to hear.''
 Roth's unusual journey on the margins of the music industry began shortly before he graduated from N.Y.U., when he and Phillip Lehman, a wealthy record collector, started Desco, a small label specializing in what was sometimes referred to as retro funk. Playing with a collection of friends and session hands, Roth and Lehman recorded a single, an original composition titled ''Let a Man Do What He Wanna Do.'' It was pretty good, in Roth's estimation, but it lacked one essential element: a singer. James Brown, Roth figured, was probably unavailable, so he and Lehman tracked down the next best thing: a fellow named Lee Fields. To most Americans, his name would have meant nothing; to Roth and his coterie of purists, Fields was a ''legend of the old soul 45s'' whose straight-from-the-heart singing and penchant for flamboyant men's wear had earned him a place in the annals of soul history.
 Fields joined Roth's outfit, and Sharon Jones, then an occasional session singer, was hired to sing backup vocals. The record was released, and a few more vinyl 45s followed. Sales were decent, but not enough to recoup the thousands of dollars Roth borrowed from credit-card companies and his sister to pay the musicians and press the records. Lehman and Roth fought over money. The company disbanded. Then a distributor vanished, owing $30,000 in royalties, and Roth's debts grew to more than $45,000, not counting student loans. Barely able to pay the rent, he took a job as a temp in the distribution unit of Sony Records. ''It was the last place in the world I wanted to be,'' he told me. ''They would have these meetings where they would say: 'Hey, what do you think about this new Maroon 5 song? What about the video?' And they would joke about how awful the songs were, and how the guys were singing out of tune and how formulaic it was and blah, blah, blah, and when they were finished joking they'd put together a two-, three-million-dollar budget to promote the next video.'' 
 Roth says he spent most of his time at Sony working on his own projects, sketching logos on the company stationery and making long-distance phone calls from his desk. One day, someone from personnel called him into the office. Roth was sure he'd be fired. When he sat down, the executive complimented him on his productivity and offered him a full-time position. ''I was just floored,'' Roth told me. ''I couldn't imagine anybody doing less than I was doing.'' Not only did Roth turn down the promotion, he quit his job.
 In 2002, Roth started a new label, Daptone, with Neal Sugarman, a talented saxophonist from Boston who had recorded with Roth on Desco. Roth and Sugarman were determined to avoid what they saw as the major labels' mistakes. They would spend conservatively, pay artists fairly and never put out a record they didn't like. That fall, on the strength of royalties owed to them by a distribution broker, they signed a seven-year lease for a two-story row house in the middle of Bushwick, one of the poorest neighborhoods in Brooklyn, across the street from a weed-strangled lot where destitute men camped in the summer. 
 Almost immediately, the broker went bankrupt, and the new label was out $40,000. ''It was rough,'' said Roth. He and a few other Daptone musicians renovated the company's headquarters by hand, converting the first floor into a recording studio. Charles Bradley, a local handyman who moonlighted as a James Brown impersonator, helped install the plumbing. Roth worked all hours -- tearing down walls, devising money-saving schemes -- and when he got home late, he says, his new wife shouted and threw records at him. Life, in Roth's view, was shaping up to be ''pretty dark,'' like ''a Jewish history lesson'' or something out of the well-thumbed pages of one of his Chaim Potok novels.
 The Daptone family, meanwhile, was growing. With the Dap-Kings serving as a house band, Roth recorded several singles and albums featuring various members of the original soul generation, gifted artists who, for one reason or another, had never crossed over into the mainstream. Among them were Naomi Shelton, a gospel singer in her late 50s who cleaned houses for a living; Charles Bradley, the James Brown impersonator; and Johnny Griggs, an erstwhile James Brown sideman who lived in a single-room-occupancy hotel in Harlem. Roth wrote songs for them and got them gigs and engineered and released their records. 
 One evening, on his way home from the studio, the car Roth was riding in went over a pothole and the airbag exploded in his face, lacerating his eyeballs. He was in the hospital for about 10 days, temporarily blinded. ''I couldn't get around by myself for a couple of months,'' he told me. Then he and his wife split up, and Roth moved into the studio and slept on the couch. 
 That winter, Daptone released Sharon Jones's second album with the Dap-Kings, ''Naturally,'' and the crowds at Jones's shows started to grow steadily. Producers in the mainstream pop world began taking notice of the Daptone sound. Kanye West sampled Jones's voice and a Dap-Kings riff for a song by a rapper named Rhymefest, and Hank Shocklee, a veteran of the 1980s rap scene, hired the band for the soundtrack of the movie ''American Gangster.'' And then Mark Ronson called. 
 Ronson, an acclaimed British-born music producer and D.J., had been hired by Island Records to produce a pop record for Amy Winehouse, then a 22-year-old white British jazz-club performer. He had been striving for a classic soul sound, with little success. ''We were using every computer trick in the book to make it sound old,'' he later told The New York Times. When he heard the Dap-Kings' cover version of the Stevie Wonder song ''Uptight (Everything's Alright),'' he knew he'd found the sound he'd been looking for. He asked the band to play behind Amy Winehouse in the studio.
 Roth had reservations. He didn't particularly love Winehouse's music, which, he says, was too angsty and self-involved for his taste. Still, he didn't want to deprive his band of a payday. By this time, Roth and the musicians he had gathered -- second-generation soul men like Binky Griptite, Fernando (Boogaloo) Velez and Homer (Funkyfoot) Steinweiss -- had spent hundreds of hours riding around the country together in rented Econoline vans, listening to Sam Cooke and the Isley Brothers, ''living and sweating the rhythm and blues,'' as Roth put it. In comparison, this was an easy gig; the record company was offering $350 per musician per song. 
 The album the Dap-Kings played on, ''Back to Black,'' sold 10 million copies. Roth won a Grammy Award for engineering and received a framed platinum record. He displayed the platinum record in the studio's decrepit downstairs bathroom, propped up against the wall, a few inches from the toilet. 
 EXCEPT FOR A PIANO-SHAPED mezuza on the doorpost and a small, transparent Daptone sticker on the door, the exterior of Daptone Records is unmarked, which has the somewhat contradictory effect of advertising Roth's disdain for self-promotion. One rainy evening, I joined Roth in the studio control room, where he sat hunched over a vintage mixing console studded with a million buttons and dials. Roth has a small-featured face, dark curls and a composed, confident manner. Ever since his eye injury, a pair of wraparound sunglasses has perpetually shielded his pupils from the light. It's as if fate has compelled him to look cool. 
 Behind him, in a badly frayed armchair, sat a round-bellied black man with a tuft of white beard growing under his lip. This was Cliff Driver, the leader of Naomi Shelton and the Gospel Queens of Brooklyn, a local group with a record coming out early next year on Daptone. Driver, like Roth, had on dark glasses; he lost his sight at the age of 9 in a rabbit-hunting accident. Roth brought him into the studio that day to review the latest mix of the Gospel Queens' album.
 Roth met Driver a decade ago. A friend of Roth's who worked at a major label had mentioned that he'd received a demo tape in the mail from someone named Fred Thomas. Roth knew the name well: Thomas was the bassist on ''Hot Pants,'' the album that Roth repeatedly listened to after having smoked weed or after having not smoked weed in college. Roth called Thomas's manager and a few weeks later went to see Thomas perform at a dive bar in the Village. He found Driver sitting behind the organ. Driver played, Roth told me, as if he were ''putting up a brick wall'': in a sturdy style, completely devoid of the self-conscious artiness that Roth disliked in indie rock. Roth introduced himself and over the next few years served as Driver's occasional apprentice, playing bass for Driver's gospel band in black churches around New York. 
 A few years into his apprenticeship, Roth presented the Gospel Queens with a handful of songs he had written. Roth is not a man of the Gospel, and so writing gospel lyrics posed a novel challenge: how to adhere to the gospel tradition without betraying his own beliefs? The solution, he found, was to write ''message songs'' -- songs ''about lifting people up and doing the right thing,'' in which God or Jesus wasn't explicitly mentioned. Such is Roth's skill at creating a sense -- or, some would say, an illusion -- of authenticity, that Driver, a consummate perfectionist, has incorporated the songs into his church repertory, regularly trotting them out before some of the more discriminating and faithful gospel audiences in the world.
 During the months that Driver spent working on the Gospel Queens album with Roth, he watched with interest and a measure of disbelief as Sharon Jones, the lead singer of the Dap-Kings, continued to surge in popularity, thanks in part to the buzz generated by Amy Winehouse. The latest Sharon Jones record, ''100 Days, 100 Nights,'' had sold more than 100,000 copies (including 4,000 vinyl LPs) since its release in October 2007, a genuine feat by independent-label standards. Driver, unsurprisingly, had begun to hope that his own collaboration with Roth might produce similar results. As Roth played him some selections in the studio, Driver picked out a series of infinitesimal flaws -- a mispronounced word here, a slightly flat note there. Roth and Driver often ''argue and fuss,'' Driver told me. Roth, for example, had to go to great lengths to persuade Driver to surrender his pricey Roland keyboard and revert to playing on an old upright piano. As the 75-year-old Driver explained to me, without irony, Roth is ''an old, traditional type,'' a stickler for a sound that Driver and his peers would just as well leave in the past with their Afros and bell-bottoms.
 Older artists like Driver, many of whom are struggling to scrounge together enough money to retire, are often mystified by Roth's devotion to antiquated, time-consuming methods. Roth shuns digital devices, stubbornly insisting on the superiority of unwieldy, old-fashioned analog equipment, like a reel-to-reel eight-track tape machine manufactured by Ampex, a company that last produced that particular model around 1971. And he spends an extra dollar on the manufacturing of each record just so that the covers are made in the style popular before 1967 -- that is, with the art printed not on the cardboard sleeve but on a paste-on jacket. Although he has conceded to the modern world's demand for CDs (fans who buy them from his Web site are offered the gracious assurance, ''It's O.K., we won't tell''), he has also released dozens of vinyl singles, a format that was considered out of date 20 years ago. During the studio session, I asked Driver what he thought about Roth's decision to issue a pair of Gospel Queens songs as a 45. ''I told him I don't know too many people who buy no 45s,'' he said, ''and he told me he'll be laughing his way to the bank.'' 
 The events of the past few years have made Roth look almost prophetic. While his label has grown, generating enough money for Jones, the lead singer of the Dap-Kings, to start a savings account so that she can move out of the projects, the mainstream music business has teetered on the brink of collapse. Roth says he believes the industry had it coming. Over the past three decades, he argues, a series of technological innovations -- the synthesizer, the CD, the laptop -- have emboldened major labels like Sony and Atlantic to replace skilled musicians with microchips, resulting in an inferior product for which the labels have foolishly tried to compensate by dumping more and more money into cynical marketing schemes -- in Roth's words, ''Faster ways to get it, cheaper ways to get it, ways to give you more of it, ways to give it to you with a can of Coke, ways to give it to you with artificial breasts and a blond hair-job.'' The one sector of the industry that has grown in recent years is vinyl manufacturing. In 2007, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, shipments of 12-inch LPs and EPs increased about 37 percent from 2006, to nearly 1.3 million records. To Roth, it makes perfect sense. Vinyl records, in his opinion, sound good, look good, smell good and are delightful to hold. They appeal to four of the five senses, and if you share Roth's idea of a relaxing evening, they can even help with the fifth -- to quote Roth, you can't roll a joint on an MP3.
 Toward the end of the session, Roth collapsed into the couch and burned a CD for Driver on his laptop. While waiting for the job to finish, he tore open an envelope containing a shiny black lacquer platter, a template for the label's next vinyl release. He then raised it to his face and inhaled deeply, as if he'd just arrived in the country after a long car ride. As he sat and picked at his dinner (a sliced apple and some peanut butter), I took the opportunity to ask Driver a few questions. Didn't he ever worry that Roth's ability to write and produce gospel songs might be compromised by the fact that Roth was, well, a Jewish atheist? 
 ''What he knew about gospel never concerned me,'' Driver said.
 And how about Roth's race? Some people, I suggested, might question whether a white man could capably write and produce songs in any ''black'' genre, whether gospel or R&B. 
 Roth interrupted me. ''Don't tell Cliff I'm white,'' he said. 
 Driver laughed. 
 TO A GREATER EXTENT than any other form of music, including jazz and hip-hop, soul reflects a broad spectrum of the African-American experience -- the plantation roots and middle-class aspirations and inner-city disappointments, the sparkle and the sweat, the spirituality and sensuality, the joy and the pain, the rhythm and the blues. It was born in the black churches of the South, came of age in the Civil Rights era, embraced its African heritage during the rise of the Black Power movement and declined when nightclub owners realized it was cheaper to hire a disco D.J. than a band. Along the way, it was molded by such immortals as Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, Aretha Franklin, Ike and Tina Turner and Otis Redding, as well as by Berry Gordy of Motown, the first African-American to own a mainstream record label, and by the superstars Marvin Gaye, Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross, not to mention Michael Jackson. It gave us ''(To Be) Young, Gifted, and Black'' and ''Miss Black America,'' the album ''Black Moses'' and the unofficial anthem of the African-American liberation movement, ''Say It Loud (I'm Black and I'm Proud).'' And it gave us the indelible image of James Brown on a Boston stage the night after the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot, instructing his young black fans to stay calm and uphold the dignity of their race.
 So where does Gabriel Roth fit in? Is he a fetishist of black culture? A musicologist in the mold of Alan Lomax? An heir to an old and often rancorous legacy of dealings between white label owners and black musicians? One critic, Siddhartha Mitter, wrote in a review of a Dap-Kings concert for The Boston Globe that ''an odor of exploitation'' seemed to hover in the nightclub where they played. Later, when I spoke with Mitter, he went even further, suggesting that Roth's wholesale appropriation of black tradition amounted to an act of ''colonialism.''
 Roth, for his part, sees himself as just one link in a long and diverse chain of people (blacks, whites, musicians, producers) who have contributed to the world's precious supply of soul music. The issue of race, he said, rarely comes up in his work. Whenever I asked him to explain his fondness for a record by Al Green or Bobby (Blue) Bland or Jesse Boone and the Astros, he gave me the same answer: ''Because it sounds good.'' In one conversation, he compared soul music to the prose of Isaac Bashevis Singer. ''There's something visceral and real about it,'' he said, ''and at the same time something very high and spiritual.'' The great soul singers, much like the great Yiddish writer, he said, succeeded in simultaneously evoking love's mystical quality and its ''raw,'' inescapably biological nature; soul, in other words, is universal.
 Roth's parents are lawyers who have worked on civil rights and discrimination cases, and when I met them last summer at their rambling house in Riverside, Calif., they told me that they exposed Gabe and his sister, Samra, to a wide swath of humanity as they were growing up. ''They would meet people who were judges,'' said Andy Roth, Gabe's father. ''They would meet people who were lawyers. They would meet people who were robbers and drug people.'' Andy would sometimes bring Gabe along on client-attorney visits. One client, a charismatic man named Jack Daniels, who was, Andy told me, ''shot in the back running from the police'' and was later ''prosecuted for killing a couple of cops,'' appears as a character in one of Roth's songs. 
 One evening when Gabe was 13, his parents sat down with him and Samra and asked how they'd feel about accepting someone new into the family. A friend was dying of cancer, and her adopted daughter, Gina, a 14-year-old girl from Guatemala, needed a home. ''Our family has a lot of love,'' Gabe's parents said, ''and Gina needs a lot of love.'' The children said yes. 
 About two years later, the Roths gathered for another talk. Gabe and Samra's friend, Terreno, or T. T., a black kid from a troubled home, had been sleeping over almost every night, and Gabe's parents were concerned about him. They presented the kids with another choice: ''We either need to kick him out or take him in for good.'' Again, Gabe and his sister chose to expand their family. 
 After Gabe left home, his family continued to take people in, and the racial makeup of the household grew increasingly complex. A Dominican girl Samra met in New York through the Big Brothers/Big Sisters program came to visit and later decided to move in with Samra. Then T. T.'s ex-girlfriend, who was Mexican-American, moved into the Roths' spare bedroom with her and T. T.'s daughter. 
 When I first learned about Roth's adolescence, I suspected that there might be some connection between the racial diversity of his household and his interest in soul music. There isn't, he told me. T. T., his black foster brother, ''was a Phil Collins fan.'' Roth speaks passionately and thoughtfully about racism and says he keeps an eye on his own prejudices to make sure that they don't get the better of him, but generally, he considers race an unimportant part of his own narrative. When Sharon Jones finally met T. T., several years after she began working with Gabe, she was stunned. Roth had never bothered to mention that his brother was black.
 ONE COOL DAY AT THE END of a show-packed summer, Jones sat in an office on the second-floor of the Daptone building, wearing a Cafe Bustelo T-shirt she received free from a pop festival. She also had on a fanny pack, which she used to use, she informed me, to carry her handgun. Jones has a full figure, strong arms and a head that looks as if it were carved out of stone. She does not resemble most people's idea of a pop star, a fact in which she takes obvious pride. Onstage and in interviews, she likes to declare that she was rejected by the mainstream music industry because she was deemed ''too short, too fat, too black'' and, after she turned 25, ''too old.'' 
 Jones was born in Augusta, Ga. -- James Brown's hometown -- and moved to Brooklyn at a young age. For the past nine years she has lived in the housing projects of Far Rockaway, Queens, with her mother. When I met Jones at the studio, she had the evening to herself, and she wanted to eat crabs. We jumped in her Honda Civic, and she drove us to a Red Lobster off the Belt Parkway, on Brooklyn's eastern shore. On the way there she talked incessantly, interrupting herself at intervals to mimic, with impressive accuracy, the tinkle of a piano, the hiss of a high-hat and the steady thud of a bass. I checked my seatbelt. Some of the Dap-Kings have a code phrase, ''Crazy Time,'' for Jones's frequent explosions of energy. Tour vehicles do not always survive these episodes intact. ''There's been a lot of chair-throwing in our band in the last few years,'' Roth told me. 
 Roth and Jones have what Roth has described as a ''co-dependent relationship.'' To borrow Roth's analogy, they form an Apollonian-Dionysian dichotomy, with Roth as the poised, rational architect and Jones as the animating spirit -- the chief source of energy, passion and occasional descents into madness. Onstage, this dynamic plays out to great effect. Jones commands the room, unleashing her booming, authoritative alto while strutting back and forth in her three-inch heels, doing the Mashed Potato and the Funky Chicken, summoning wide-eyed young men from the audience to dance with her. Roth is a far less dramatic presence. As Jones sings, he slowly roams the stage with his bass, flashing subtle hand signals to his bandmates. Each signal corresponds either to a song or to what Roth refers to as ''shtick'' -- a flare of brass, a cascade of cymbal and guitar: glittery bits of show-biz gimmickry whose effect is to transform what would otherwise be a mere collection of songs into a scintillating and cohesive show. Roth rejects the tyranny of the set list. The structure of each set depends on a variety of factors that he monitors throughout the performance -- the crowd's response, Jones's mood, the strength of her voice. As soon as he issues a command, the band springs into action, exploding into a frenzy of bright noise or collapsing into a ballad or swiftly scaling the peaks of an ascending chord pattern. 
 In recent years, a relentless schedule has taken its toll on the band's morale. At one point this summer, Jones and Roth clashed over money -- just as Roth and his first partner, Phillip Lehman, did nearly a decade before, bringing about an end to Roth's first venture. Jones asked Roth for publishing royalties for songs that, technically speaking, she didn't write. (Her argument was that in interpreting Roth's songs, she was doing as much to create them as he was.) After much deliberation over what would constitute the most ethical course of action, Roth dismissed the advice of his lawyers and agreed to pay her a percentage of all the publishing income those songs had generated over the past 12 years. When I asked Roth how much this would cost him, he gave me a dour look and said, ''A lot.''
 It had been an exasperating summer for Roth. His calendar was crammed with big music festivals, and he was forever deflecting journalists' questions about Amy Winehouse's struggles with addiction. With commercial concerns consuming so much of his time, he scarcely had any time for making music. He became irritable. At a sound check before the band's appearance on Conan O'Brien's talk show, he argued with a soundman over the best way to mike the drums. At a ritzy hotel in Hollywood, or as he liked to call it, ''Hollyweird,'' I watched him stroll out to the pool, take one look at the surgically enhanced bodies darkening in the sun and ponder, dryly, ''Where's the pool with the ugly people?'' 
 Still, there were moments when the clouds parted, revealing the unabashed enthusiasm of the teenage music nerd who fell in love with the songs of James Brown. That side of him was never more apparent than when he was listening to records, or even just looking at them. One afternoon, while we were waiting for Syl Johnson, a 72-year-old singer and guitarist from Chicago, to arrive at the studio for a recording date, Roth sat down on the floor with a case of old 45s and began going through them. He had set out to find a record for Johnson to autograph, but in his enthusiasm for each record that he unearthed he seemed to forget his original purpose. 
 ''This is good,'' he said, placing a record on a growing pile beside him. He held up a record with a pristine red and black label and glanced at Nydia Davila, his label manager, who was sitting nearby. ''You know this version of 'Come Closer to Me'?'' he asked. 
 ''Yeah!'' she said. 
 ''So good!'' he said.
 ''So good,'' she agreed.
