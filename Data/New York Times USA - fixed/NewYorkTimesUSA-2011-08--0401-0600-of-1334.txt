HEADLINE: Fiscal Forecasting at S.&P.

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Standard &#038; Poor's says the "predictability" of federal fiscal decisions is not what it used to be. But once it seemed to accept forecasts that the federal debt would be eliminated.

 BODY:
In cutting the rating of the United States government, Standard & Poor's complained that "the predictability" of American government actions is not what it used to be. 
It based its decision in part on a forecast of how much the federal government would owe 10 years from now.
The downgrade reflects our view that the effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policy making and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges. ...
We have changed our view of the difficulties in bridging the gulf between the political parties over fiscal policy, which makes us pessimistic about the capacity of Congress and the Administration to be able to leverage their agreement this week into a broader fiscal consolidation plan that stabilizes the government's debt dynamics any time soon. ...
Under our revised base case fiscal scenario ... we now project that net general government debt would rise from an estimated 74% of GDP by the end of 2011 to 79% in 2015 and 85% by 2021. 
Oh, for the good old days when a Republican House and a Democratic president were united in working toward a common goal. Then there was predictability.
U.S. debt has been paid down significantly over the past two years, and it is estimated that U.S. publicly held debt will have been reduced by about $300 billion by the end of 2000. Additional debt reduction initiatives are planned at the federal level before the end of the year. ...
On a broader scale, the president and the speaker of the House of Representatives have both called for the elimination of federal public debt by 2013 and 2015, respectively. Both plans would eliminate publicly held debt over about the same time frame, but through different means. ...
Speaker of the House J. Dennis Hastert has called on the House Budget Committee to develop a budget that would accommodate eliminating the federal debt by the year 2015. Speaker Hastert believes this can be accomplished through maintaining the Social Security Trust Fund, weeding out wasteful government spending, and prudently spending surplus tax dollars to pay down outstanding debt and invest in other national priorities (such as strengthening Social Security and Medicare).

HEADLINE: Weak Stocks, Weak Economy?

BYLINE: MOTOKO RICH


HIGHLIGHT: A reminder that a downturn in the markets does not always foreshadow the same in the economy at large.

 BODY:
Amidst the sell-off on Monday and the calmer waters this morning, here's a thought from Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at the High Frequency Economics research firm: a weak stock market is not always a sign of a weak economy.
 Remember Black Monday, 1987? By that October day, stocks had fallen 36 percent from their peak in August. Yet in 1988, the economy grew by 4.1 percent, even though the market had recovered only half its losses.
Admittedly, aside from the stock market slide, signs are not exactly great right now for the economy. But Mr. Shepherdson is taking heart from the 4.8 percent increase in chain store sales reported by Redbook Research during the first week of August compared with a year earlier.
Consumer confidence reports have been dismal recently, but Mr. Shepherdson points out that when you ask people "'how do you feel, they say 'miserable.' But that doesn't necessarily mean you don't go shopping."
So maybe that's something to get a few of those traders to take their heads out of their hands.

HEADLINE: On New York's Low Seas: Day 2

BYLINE: COREY KILGANNON


HIGHLIGHT: It may lack the aesthetic appeal of other parts of New York's waterways, but the waters between Staten Island and New Jersey are an economic lifeline for the region.

 BODY:
If the Statue of Liberty ferry passed right by Lady Liberty and took a five-minute detour farther to the west, the tourists - and even most seen-it-all New Yorkers - would get an eye-opening take on glamorous New York Harbor's gritty, hard-working side.
 This would include the Kill Van Kull, the waterway that runs between the north shore of Staten Island and the southern tip of Bayonne, N.J., as well as Newark Bay, around the corner from New York Harbor.
Shielded from the harbor by Bayonne and Staten Island, these are gritty, industrial waterways, with very few sightseers or pleasure boaters.
A stretch of the Kill Van Kull is a veritable tugboat repair shop. Huge tugs rest on mammoth flotation platforms that hoist them out of the water for workers to access. Many active tugs are docked here too, and their captains pace the decks holding two-way radios, waiting for the next assignment.
On Tuesday, near the tugs, a crew of welders repaired a 100-foot-long steel barge. The workers wore protective hoods and masks and climbed the beams like a high-wire troupe. They used arc welders and torches to put a new hull and sides onto the damaged barge, fastening steel plates up to two inches thick onto its steel-beam frame. 
"Then a huge crane comes and lifts it into the water," said a supervisor, Ramon Acosta, 58.
Under the Bayonne Bridge, a turn leads into Newark Bay, where the vessels are of a massive scale that rivals even the skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan. The tankers, which hail from far-flung countries, are piled high with metal storage containers the size of tractor-trailers.
They are escorted by teams of tugs to unloading stations, where huge structures with outstretched arms pick off the metal containers. This is done by an operator in a glass-bottomed gondola that extends out over the deck. Like in an arcade game, the operator lowers a set of claws that carries the containers onto short stacks onshore.
 The channels in this area are upward of 40 feet deep, but they constantly grow more shallow over time, necessitating dredging. On Tuesday, several cranes worked away, plunging scoopers into the water and lifting tons of silt into containers on barges. The crane operators worked from images of the bottom taken by survey boats. A drill-rig pounded away nearby, to loosen the rocky bottom, said Nick Ripley, 28, an engineer on the Jay Michael, a tugboat that supports a crane dredging around the clock.
Wearing a hard hat, wraparound sunglasses and a grease-smudged life jacket, Mr. Ripley said he works for 20 days at a time, and lives in the tug with three other crew members.
"We got a 40-inch flat screen in here," he said, motioning up toward the red-painted tower on the tug.
There are a hearty few recreational boaters around here, including the roughly 100 members of the 100-year-old Robbins Reef Yacht Club in Bayonne, directly across the river from a freighter unloading station. Members have learned to tolerate the smell of oil, and the soot on their boats from fuel residue released by low-flying planes accessing Newark Liberty International Airport nearby.
 Many of the members fish among the tankers, tugs and barges, and crab in the murky waters, said John Youngclaus, the club's vice-commodore.
 "I wouldn't be too crazy about eating it, but they do," he said. "No one swims here, but people have fallen in."
 He pointed out their three-story clubhouse, the top floor of which goes unused.
 "It's haunted," Mr. Youngclaus said. "A ghost named Vance."
Mr. Youngclaus said he was cleaning up the bar one night when he sensed that the ghost was behind him.
"I ran out the door, left all the money and everything else behind," he said.
Just off the north shore of Staten Island lies Shooters Island, inhabited only by a wide variety of birds and greenery, and lined with decaying wooden structures.
On the Staten Island coastline nearby lies a lonely, neglected passenger ferry with the words "You Go Girl" scrawled in large bubble-lettered graffiti on the side. Farther to the west, the shoreline is lined with gnarled, rusted steel old ships and cranes and other maritime equipment. An osprey with a fish clasped in its talons flew back to its nest, high atop a rusted metal structure that looked like an old ship's boiler.
Heading south along the western shoreline of Staten Island, the deep waterway is lined with old industrial buildings and with active oil refineries and storage facilities. There are scant signs of residential life, save for the odd fisherman perched on decrepit wooden bulkheads. On a bridge that spanned the waterway, a seemingly endless freight train rumbled overhead.
"This is a busy industrial port," Mr. Ripley said. "You got to be on your toes all the time because a lot of things are always going on."

HEADLINE: My House, Our Home

BYLINE: EMILY LIEDEL


HIGHLIGHT: A video portrait of two women sharing a home.

 BODY:
Recently, in the early hours of the morning, Anna Novak, 81, got up to use the bathroom in her home in White Plains. She fell, hitting her head and left arm against the bathtub.
"Antimina!" she called.
Antimina Garmley, a 65-year-old retired nurse who has lived with Mrs. Novak since July 2010, awoke in the next room. She jumped out of bed and ran into the bathroom. Kevin Novak, getting ready for work, also heard his mother's calls and hurried across the hall.
Mrs. Novak had broken a finger, dislocated her wrist and gashed her left eyebrow. After her son picked her up off the floor, Ms. Garmley bandaged her head and then drove her to the hospital.
Ms. Garmley and Mrs. Novak had met through a home share program for seniors at Westchester Residential Opportunities in White Plains, which matches senior homeowners with people of any age looking for affordable housing.
When Ms. Garmley approached Westchester Residential Opportunities, she was looking for an apartment, but she grew intrigued when the agency suggested a home share.
At the same time, Mr. Novak, 43, was increasingly concerned about leaving his mother at home alone. Feeling isolated, she had moved back to White Plains from rural upstate New York a couple of years earlier. Mr. Novak had been in and out since then. She grew anxious in his absence and complained of being lonely, and her son, constantly worried that she would fall or forget to take her medication, felt compelled to check on her often. 
Ms. Garmley and Mr. Novak met for lunch before speaking with Mrs. Novak at her home. When Ms. Garmley moved into the spare bedroom shortly thereafter, the effect on the older woman's mental health was immediate. "I used to be very down and out, worried and depressed, and I'm not so depressed when she's here with me," Mrs. Novak said. "Because I know she can do things I can't do."
Some 27 percent of people over age 65 live alone, compared with 10 percent of the total population, according to census data. Annette Leahy Maggitti, co-president of the National Shared Housing Resource Center, said that interest in shared housing has grown since the economic downturn. A similar program she runs in Baltimore matched 102 pairs in 2010, compared with 49 in 2008. HomeShare Vermont, another prominent matching service, saw an increase from 54 matches in 2008 to 76 in 2010.
The most common reason seniors give for renting out a room is financial, Ms. Maggitti said. But she adds that older people, some living alone for the first time, feel happier and less anxious after a home sharer moves in. Simply living with someone who can drive, do household chores and provide simple caregiving can help seniors remain independent longer.
Ms. Garmley drives Mrs. Novak to doctors' appointments, cooks dinner, does laundry and helps Mrs. Novak remember her medication. But, Ms. Garmley said, "The main thing is being a companion. And being here to do things for her, like going to the drugstore. Just being able to watch TV with her and talk about what is in the newspaper."
The two women's relationship sometimes resembles that of a nurse and patient, sometimes that of relatives. Ms. Garmley, whose mother died when she was young, refers to Mrs. Novak as "mother." Mrs. Novak said they have been mistaken for sisters when shopping.
They argue occasionally. Interpersonal relationships often pose the greatest challenge for home shares, Ms. Maggitti said, particularly since seniors may never have lived with roommates. "The homeowner has to realize that there is some compromise on their part, some loss of privacy," Ms. Maggitti said.
Other challenges include municipal statutes that discourage unrelated people from living together, lack of knowledge about home sharing and a stigma against renting out rooms.
But since Mrs. Novak fell, she needs help putting on a shirt, getting down the stairs and buttering her toast, and Ms. Garmley's assistance has become even more important. "I would be lost without her," Mrs. Novak said.

HEADLINE: Financial Stocks Bounce Back

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: Bank of America, Citigroup and JPMorgan are among the leading gainers a day after a market bloodbath.

 BODY:
Financial stocks were higher on Tuesday morning, providing some relief after the market bloodbath on Monday. 
The financial sector was leading the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index higher after the first half hour of trading. 
All eyes were on shares of Bank of America, which plummeted 20.3 percent on Monday to their lowest level in more than two years. The stock recovered Tuesday morning, rising nearly 5 percent, to $6.80, but off its earlier high of $7.70. 
Analysts at Nomura lent some support, writing in a note that "we think the 20 percent sell-off in BAC yesterday seems overdone as the bank still has solid consumer and capital markets franchises and a much improved balance sheet versus 2008."
Investors will also be watching for how Brian Moynihan, the chief executive of Bank of America, fares on Wednesday in a conference call that is being held by Fairholme Capital Management, which owns a little less than 1 percent of the bank. 
Wells Fargo analysts said the call " carries risks of not meeting the market's desire for answers on three key topics."
Those topics are, according to the analysts:
In our view, Moynihan must convince investors of: 1) why BAC executives remain confident that the company will not be required to issue common equity, particularly in the event of a double dip in the broader U.S. economy? 2) what other options might be considered by BAC to improve the bank's Tier 1 common and tangible common equity ratios in the absence of additional common equity?; and 3) can BAC provide a more firm estimate of future mortgage putback liabilities from the GSE and non GSE investors?
Other financial stocks were higher in early trading. Shares of Citigroup were up more than 4 percent, while JPMorgan Chase was up 3 percent. Goldman Sachs was roughly flat, while Morgan Stanley was down more than 1 percent.

HEADLINE: Visa Wants U.S. Cards to Catch Up With the World

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Visa said it would accelerate the adoption of more secure E.M.V. cards, which many Americans need to make purchases outside of the country.

 BODY:
Visa said on Tuesday that it would take steps to speed up adoption in the United States of credit and debit cards that use secure E.M.V. chips.
The reaction from those of us here at Bucks? "It's about time!"
Bucks writers and our colleagues at The Times have written often about the problems increasingly faced by Americans using credit cards when traveling abroad. These problems occur because United States credit card companies and merchants continue to use older, less-secure magnetic stripe technology.
In Europe and elsewhere overseas, cards with embedded E.M.V. chips, which are microprocessors that provide heightened security, are becoming the norm, and "mag stripe" cards sometimes don't work, particularly at unattended kiosks that, for instance, sell train tickets. (E.M.V. stands for Europay, MasterCard and Visa.)
While the rest of the world has moved to the chips, the United States has lingered in a chicken-and-egg limbo, with retailers loathe to spend money on new payment systems until card companies adopted the new technology, and card companies reluctant to use the chip cards until merchants agreed to accept them.
Now, Visa says that accelerating a switch to E.M.V. technology in the United States will not only enhance security when credit and debit cards are used, but also will help prepare for increased use of mobile systems that let shoppers pay by waving their cellphones at a payment terminal. (Systems that let shoppers pay with their phones use E.M.V. chips, too).
Visa's plan offers financial incentives for retailers to upgrade their payment systems voluntarily while card issuers make the transition to the chip cards. The new systems will be able to process payments from multiple methods during the transition period, including cards with magnetic stripes and E.M.V. chips, as well as mobile systems using smartphones. The overall changeover is likely to take five to six years.
Visa's announcement comes as some banks are starting to offer E.M.V.-enabled credit cards, mainly for affluent customers who travel internationally. A few credit unions have been offering the cards too. Further, some large merchants are backing the new technology: the McDonald's Corporation has deployed chip-capable terminals in the United States, and Nordstrom has voiced support as well.
Randy Vanderhoof, executive director of the SmartCard Alliance, said in an e-mail that Visa's move was the "ignition point" that was needed to spark a migration to the technology in the United States, because merchants have been waiting for a road map from card companies as to what technologies to invest in. "Now that Visa has signaled that the future will include contact chips and mobile contactless payments," he wrote, "they know what the next generation of payments will look like."
In an e-mail, the MasterCard spokesman Seth Eisen said that "To date, consumer demand and market economics have not justified a migration in the U.S. We are helping our customers understand what the implications of E.M.V. and other technologies in the U.S. would be. Any migration must take into account all customer and consumer interests if a collective effort is to be successful. Obviously, Visa's decision will impact market direction and we will continue to consider our actions accordingly."
American Express hadn't provided a statement by post time.

HEADLINE: An Experiment in Austerity

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: There's no easy answer to whether fiscal contraction can coexist with growth, an economist writes, but in a slack economy, budget cutbacks are unlikely to help recovery.

 BODY:
One reason that economics is not a true science is that economists can't really perform experiments in which certain details are altered to see if they change the results and in what way. Of course, small experiments can be done using student volunteers playing economic games, but we can't rerun the 1980s without the Reagan tax cut, which was signed into law 30 years ago this Saturday, and see if we would have gotten slower growth. Economists do their best to simulate alternative scenarios, but it's not the same thing as rerunning the same history under different sets of policies.
But once in a while economists get to observe a natural experiment where policy is changed in a way that allows a theory to be tested by real-world results. We are about to run just such an experiment by tightening fiscal policy and cutting spending significantly below baseline projections at a time when the economy is weak. As I pointed out in a July 12 post, we performed this experiment once before, in 1937. The budget deficit was sharply reduced and a recession immediately followed.
Since the beginning of our recent economic woes, there has been a theoretical debate among economists about the proper governmental response. I think it is reasonable to say that most supported the idea of fiscal stimulus in principle, although there certainly were different opinions about the size and structure of the February 2009 Recovery Act. But there were also conservative economists arguing that the stimulus was a bad idea for the same reasons they urged Franklin D. Roosevelt to balance the budget in 1937. Funds that the government borrows would be better invested by the private sector, they said.
Conservatives lost the first round, but have launched a counterattack. Their primary argument is that Congress enacted a $787 billion stimulus package and two and a half years later the economy is still in neutral. Stimulus supporters, like this paper's columnist Paul Krugman, have long argued that the stimulus was too small to do more than moderate the downturn and wasn't large enough to offset the negative economic momentum that the Obama administration inherited.
To average people, however, $787 billion sounds like a lot of money; more than enough to do the job if the theory on which it was based was sound in the first place. Consequently, many people have concluded that the stimulus experiment has failed and are receptive to the conservative theory that fiscal contraction may do a better job of jump-starting growth.A June NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll asked if a cut in government spending would help or hurt the economic recovery; 37 percent said it would help, 31 percent thought it would hurt and 23 percent said would have no effect. A July Washington Post/ABC News poll asked people if they thought large cuts in federal spending would do more to create jobs or cut jobs; 47 percent said it would create jobs, with 44 percent saying it would cut jobs.
Space prohibits a full discussion of the theory and data underlying the debate among economists on what the economic effects of fiscal consolidation will be. Prominent economists at respected institutions have been discussing the effects for some time with complicated results.
The European Central Bank has published a number of papers over the last several years strongly endorsing the idea that fiscal contractions can be expansionary. Its latest study was published on July 12 and finds that the economy's reaction to higher spending depends critically on expectations. If it is expected to be reversed in the future it is expansionary, but if it is expected to continue indefinitely then it is contractionary. If the results are symmetrical, then cuts in spending viewed as temporary may be contractionary while those viewed as permanent may be expansionary.
The International Monetary Fund has also published a considerable amount of research on this topic. Its latest study was published on July 6 and found that analyses which show fiscal contraction to be expansionary have misspecified the relevant changes in the fiscal balance. They lumped deficit reductions resulting from nonpolicy-driven factors, like stock market booms that raised government revenues, together with those explicitly engineered by policy makers. The I.M.F. study concluded that when the analysis was limited to policy-driven fiscal contractions, they were all economically contractionary. It found that a 1 percent of gross domestic product fiscal consolidation reduces real private consumption by 0.75 percent and real G.D.P. by 0.62 percent over the next two years.
A June 16 paper for the Bank for International Settlements found that the principal stimulus from fiscal consolidation came from lower interest rates and exchange rate depreciation, which boosted exports. Therefore, if interest rates are already quite low and depreciation is not possible, then there may not be any mechanism whereby fiscal consolidation can be expansionary.
The Congressional Research Service explained in a June 6 report that the economic effects of fiscal consolidation depend a great deal on the point in the business cycle in which it is carried out. Those occurring when the economy is operating close to its potential were successful by freeing public resources for private use, exactly as conservatives say, but those that took place when there was a large amount of unused capacity were not. The study concluded, "Fiscal adjustments beginning in a slack economy (like the current situation in the United States) appear to have a low probability of success."
My point is not to exhaust the issues involved in calculating the economic effects of fiscal contraction; only to show that it is complicated. Readers should be skeptical of simplistic studies that cherry pick their examples, fail to control for variables other than the deficit as a share of G.D.P. and don't make any effort to explain examples that don't prove their point. A good place to start any analysis is a recently compiled data set of fiscal consolidation episodes by the I.M.F.

HEADLINE: Mormonism and Mitt Romney's "Weirdness"

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Is the White House planning an anti-Mormon "dog whistle" if Romney is the GOP nominee?

 BODY:
Thanks to the current spate of awful economic news, we pretty much know what kind of re-election campaign Barack Obama is going to wage: A relentlessly negative one, which, like George W. Bush's re-election campaign against John Kerry, will focus almost exclusively on making the challenger seem unacceptable rather than defending the sitting president's accomplishments. Thanks to Ben Smith at Politico, we also know roughly how the White House plans to "destroy Mitt Romney," if he turns out to be that challenger: By "attacking him as inauthentic, unprincipled and, in a word used repeatedly by Obama's advisers in about a dozen interviews, 'weird.'"
Weird how, you ask? Here's Smith:
The character attacks on Romney will focus on what critics view as a makeover, both personal (skinny jeans) and political (abortion) ... Democrats also plan to amplify what Obama strategists described as the "weirdness" quotient, the sum of awkward public encounters and famous off-kilter anecdotes, first among them the tale of Romney having strapped his dog to the roof of his car.
None of the Obama advisers interviewed made any suggestion that Romney's personal qualities would be connected to his minority Mormon faith, but the step from casting Romney as a bit off to raising questions about religion may not be a large step for some of the incumbent's supporters.
Indeed. The crucial thing to understand here is that Romney's Latter Day Saint affiliation isn't just a potential liability among evangelical voters in Republican primaries. It's a potential general election liability as well. In a recent Gallup poll, 18 percent of Republicans described themselves as unwilling to vote for a Mormon candidate - but that number actually to 19 percent among Independents, and 27 percent among Democrats.
Who are these non-conservative Mormon skeptics? Well, their ranks probably include a lot of theologically conservative/politically liberal Christians (mainly African American and Hispanic ) who regard Mormonism as a dangerous heresy, and a lot of secular liberals who dislike the L.D.S.'s positions (and politicking) on issues like gay marriage. But most likely some of them are people who don't have a particular theological or political ax to grind, who know Mormonism primarily through pop culture (from"Big Love" and "Sister Wives" to "South Park" and "The Book of Mormon") and the occasional encounter with bicycling missionaries, and who have a vague sense of the L.D.S. church as little bit cultish, a little bit outside-the-mainstream, and a little bit, well, . Presumably the Obama campaign sees this half-formed attitude as the fertile ground in which its "Romney the weirdo" seeds will take root and grow.
The trouble is that winking at Romney's faith doesn't fit into any of the broader issues that will be front-and-center in the 2012 campaign. The Bush campaign's attempt to paint John Kerry as an effete, quasi-French flip-flopper who couldn't be trusted with the nation's defense made sense because 2004 was a wartime election, and the character issues went directly to questions about what Americans wanted in their commander-in-chief. I have a much harder time seeing how insinuations about the peculiarity of Romney's theological commitments fits into a narrative about why Americans shouldn't trust him with a lousy economy. His Mormonism, in this sense, may turn out to be a lot like Barack Obama's connections to Bill Ayers and the Chicago left, which conservatives tried to make hay from in the waning days of the '08 election: In a different kind of race, it might be a serious liability, but in a campaign focused on jobs, debt and growth, trying to sow doubts about Romney's faith will just make the Democrats look out of touch. They'd be much better off just accusing him of being a soulless corporate layoff artist and leaving it at that.

HEADLINE: Ex-Youngstown Mayor Tackles the Work of Revitalizing Automotive Communities

BYLINE: MARY M. CHAPMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Jay Williams now heads the Office of Recovery for Auto Communities and Workers, which is charged with revitalizing communities impacted by the downturn of 2008 and 2009.

 BODY:
Two years ago, when President Obama ordered the establishment of the Office of Recovery for Auto Communities and Workers, the nation's automotive industry, like much of the economy, seemed headed into the nadir. General Motors and Chrysler were broke, new-vehicle sales had tanked and the prospect of hiring was improbable.
Since then, motor vehicle and parts employment has improved 11.5 percent through last June, according to the Center for Automotive Research, a nonprofit research group in Ann Arbor, Mich. Industrywide, vehicle sales are generally improving, and automotive companies have announced intentions to hire. That said, employment is down 48.3 percent from its level in 2000 in automotive communities impacted by the downturn, according to data from the center.
That latter figure is chiefly why the Office of Recovery, under the purview of the Labor Department, remains in place. If private investment isn't readily available, the office works to find ways for these communities to be revitalized in other ways, even if that means transitioning to different industries.
Jay Williams is expected to assist these automotive-dependent communities in the midst of transformation. On Aug. 1, a week after his tenure ended as mayor of Youngstown, Ohio, Mr. Williams, 40, became the new executive director of the Office of Recovery.
Mr. Williams began serving as Youngstown's mayor in 2006. A recipient of the 2007 John F. Kennedy Presidential Library New Frontier Award, which annually recognizes two young Americans involved in public service, Mr. Williams was widely credited with resurrecting what had become a city too dependent on a flailing steel industry. He is said to have played a major role in the city's planning initiative, which helped to recast its business image. (The city was included recently on Forbes magazine's list of the nation's fastest-growing industrial areas.)
Indeed, Mr. Williams, a Youngstown native, sees his charge as an extension of his mayoral efforts.
"I plan to continue to coordinate a federal response to communities affected by the decline of the auto industry and the manufacturing industry in general," he said in a telephone interview.
He expects the office to fast-track community transformations by eliminating bureaucratic red tape and fostering philanthropic and private investment. "There's not a static list of communities," he said. "But we know that communities used to manufacturing things can manufacture things other than autos and parts."
Mr. Williams, also a former examiner for the Federal Reserve Bank in Cleveland, said his first priority was to make the rounds of communities that likely would need his office's help.
"They want to redefine themselves economically and otherwise," he said. "And it's understood that the federal government has a role to play."
Some assistance will involve job training for displaced auto workers, as well as working to secure grants or tax abatements for environmentally progressive companies. The office will coordinate with other federal agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency to get brownfields cleaned up for development.
Ed Montgomery, the office's former director, now dean of the school of public policy at Georgetown University, said there was much work to be done.
"I think the key question is how to keep the momentum going and make sure access to resources are available," he said. The budget for the office proper has increased from $277 million in fiscal year 2009 to $2.4 million for 2012, an office spokesman confirmed.
"But Williams's background, having been a mayor of a city going through a transition, places him in a strong position," Mr. Montgomery said. "He knows the frustrations at the local level and how to work with other elected officials and governors."
To hear other mayors tell it, the office already has scored successes. Dayne Walling, the mayor of Flint, Mich., said the office acted as a liaison between the city and the E.P.A. to secure $30 million for the cleanup of the old Buick City factory site.
"That was critical for planned redevelopment along an interstate and rail lines," he said in a telephone interview. "They gave us access to a number of federal agencies that for a midsize city we ordinarily wouldn't have."
Detroit, a prospective poster child for post-automotive dependency, is hoping for more interaction with the federal office. In an e-mailed statement, the office of Mayor David Bing said the federal office had been "critical" in helping the city "leverage existing federal resources to create initiatives like the Strong Cities Strong Communities program," it said, referencing a pilot program that began in Detroit and other automotive-dependent cities in July.
But Jeremy Anwyl, the chief executive of Edmunds.com, is dubious of the office's efficacy to date.
"It was created around the bankruptcies, and I think it was basically done to generate political air cover," he said in a telephone interview. "There was a lot happening at the time, and I think the announcement was designed to ease some of that pain. And they've kept a low profile, which is probably not a good idea."
Hilda S. Solis, the Labor secretary and Mr. Williams's new boss, however, feels that he is positioned to be an advocate not only for the communities he serves, but for the agency's accomplishments as well.
"I've been with Jayson to Flint, Mich., and other places, and the local mayors knew him," said Ms. Solis in a telephone interview. "He's respected among his colleagues, and he understands the kinds of issues that are challenges because he's already had to deal with them."
Mr. Williams, meanwhile, is keenly aware that results are expected of him, his office and the communities he serves.
"We've made a commitment. The administration is committed, the president just made a commitment to renew the office, and we'll continue this important work," he said. "And we've got to spend time touting our successes."

HIGHLIGHT: To sell its Huayra hypercar in the United States, Pagani Automobili must install sophisticated and pricey air-bag systems, N.H.T.S.A. ruled on Tuesday.

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Though it was unveiled to a North American audience last week in Pasadena, Calif., the Pagani Huayra is encountering resistance from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which stipulates that the hypercar be equipped with sophisticated air-bag systems. Pagani Automobili had appealed for a hardship exemption, which would have allowed the 700-horsepower Huayra to go on sale in the United States without the air bags, but in a notice posted to the agency's Web site on Tuesday, the agency said that the Italian automaker had "failed to demonstrate that compliance would cause substantial economic hardship." (Transportation Department - PDF)
 Ford moved Tuesday to dispel reports that the rollout for the automaker's Focus Electric model was delayed. David Finnegan, the Ford marketing manager for electrified vehicles, was quoted on a forum site saying that the car would ship in spring of 2012 to 19 targeted markets aside from California and New York, the car's launch markets, which are scheduled to receive the E.V.'s by the end of 2011. In a statement, Ford said that it always intended a staggered rollout for the E.V. Alan R. Mulally, Ford president and chief executive, appeared on "The Late Show With David Letterman" last week with the car. (USA Today)
 Ford is also making an aggressive product push for the Frankfurt auto show, which begins press previews on Sept. 13. The automaker is expected to show four new models, including a design concept. Among the models already previewed as concepts that are expected to be shown in production form is the Focus ST high-performance hatchback. Ford showed the Vertrek concept at the Detroit auto show in January, which is widely believed to dictate the styling direction for the coming replacement of the Escape compact S.U.V. (Car & Driver)
 Though supercar manufacturers tend not to traffic in new-product blitzes, Ferrari is reportedly planning to produce four models over the next two years. The first of these, a convertible version of its 458 Italia, is expected to have its debut at the Frankfurt auto show in September. Also planned are a replacement for the 599 GTB, a track-tuned Scuderia version of the 458 and a new flagship hypercar in the mold of the Enzo. Meanwhile, the brand's new FF shooting brake will begin deliveries in the United States shortly. (Car magazine, via Automotive News)
 On Monday, Toyota announced pricing for its Yaris subcompact, which was redesigned for 2012. The base two-door hatchback will cost $14,115, before destination charge, while the higher-specification SE will begin at $17,200. The Yaris will be expected to compete within a crowded segment that includes the Mazda 2, Nissan Versa, Hyundai Accent, Honda Fit, Ford Fiesta and Kia Rio. (Toyota)

HEADLINE: The Fed Splits

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: A split Fed promises rates will stay low until 2013, and the already-low yields on two-year Treasuries fall to record lows. But the Fed is not willing to do any more now, even though it agrees that the economy is getting weaker.

 BODY:
There is more than meets the eye to the split at the Federal Reserve. There must be.
The Fed's statement Tuesday afternoon says that the majority "currently anticipates that economic conditions - including low rates of resource utilization and a subdued outlook for inflation over the medium run - are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate at least through mid-2013."
Three dissenters said that they "would have preferred to continue to describe economic conditions as likely to warrant exceptionally low levels for the federal funds rate for an extended period."
Now there's something to fight over. I say we need low rates "at least through mid-2013." You say "an extended period." 
All this sounds like much ado about very little, but the Fed majority is all but promising that rates will stay low for nearly two years. We used to think "an extended period" could mean a few months.
In reality, the statement was an implicit invitation to traders to drive rates down further on the two-year Treasury note, and that happened immediately. Before the announcement the two-year rate was around 0.27 percent. Now it is 0.19 percent. That is a record low. Two weeks ago it was over 0.4 percent.
The initial stock market reaction was negative, presumably because there was some hope that the Fed would do more - like start another quantitative easing program, QE3. Instead there is a promise that the Fed "will maintain its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its securities holdings. The committee will regularly review the size and composition of its securities holdings and is prepared to adjust those holdings as appropriate."
In other words, they might do a QE3. Or they might not.
Perhaps the dissenters really want to essentially say something like "We've done all we can, and if the economy is still lousy, that is for someone else to deal with." And the majority is unwilling to do that.
As it is, the Fed has signed on to the widespread perception that the economy is getting worse. But it is not doing a whole lot.
The fact that the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, now has three dissenters is a sign that the Fed, like one or two other Washington institutions you might be able to name, is less and less able to speak with one voice.

HEADLINE: Fuel Economy: It's Not Just for Cars Anymore

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Under new government rules, medium trucks are likely to end up using a lot of the technologies that cars do already -- hybridization, for example. Heavier trucks could undergo some bigger changes.

 BODY:
The Obama administration issued fuel economy standards on Tuesday for medium and heavy trucks, the first time the government has regulated vehicles over 8,500 pounds.
The vehicles in this category range from the very largest S.U.V.'s, and pickup trucks that are too big to be household vehicles, all the way to 18-wheelers, which have a maximum loaded weight of 80,000 pounds.
But in one sense the economics are the same for a 4,000-pound car or a truck weighing 20 times that much: better fuel economy usually means paying more for the new vehicle but also saving money at the pump. One argument for government fuel economy standards is that car buyers almost always focus on the purchase price as opposed to the total cost, including the operating cost.Yet medium and heavy trucks are mostly owned by companies, which often have accountants, engineers and other professionals who can compare the value of a gallon of fuel saved against the higher price for a more efficient engine and make the right decision. (Fuel-efficient models already exist.) The government says that the extra costs are paid back in a year or two.
So why do fleet buyers, who are perfectly capable of making such calculations, need government standards to help tell them how to make the best buy?
Advocates give several reasons. One is that at the lower end of the weight scale, many of the vehicles are owned by very small businesses or individuals. "They may not have the staff of number crunchers that FedEx does,'' said Zoe Lipman, the senior manager of transportation solutions at the National Wildlife Federation.
The other is that a lot of the big trucks are operated by small companies. According to the Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, which says it has 115,000 members, "nearly 96 percent of registered motor carriers in the U.S. operate 20 or fewer trucks.''
The association opposed the new rule. It argued that it would drive up costs for small businesses and that the government should have focused on training drivers to use less fuel. In fact, many of the small companies buy used trucks.
Eventually the most efficient trucks in the rule published on Tuesday - the ones in the 2018 model year - will be old and will end up in the hands of companies that buy them used. But the association said that higher prices for trucks would encourage companies to keep their older ones longer. That would have negative implications for air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as well as fuel economy.
The medium trucks will use a lot of the technologies that cars do already - hybridization, for example, especially for urban delivery vehicles. Over-the-road trucks could undergo some bigger changes. Allen R. Schaeffer, the director of the Diesel Technology Forum, a trade group, predicted that some big trucks would begin carrying a tiny extra engine called an auxiliary power unit that could run the air-conditioning in the cabin while the truck was parked. The main engine uses a half a gallon or more of fuel for each hour of idling, he said.
Big trucks might also get more sophisticated fuel injection systems, and electric motors to run the power steering. Trucks do little steering on the highway, but a conventional power steering system pulls energy continuously from the engine through a drive belt.

HEADLINE: Grim Headlines Hang Over Iowa Campaigning

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: This year's Iowa straw poll is taking place amid grim news that is changing the typically lighthearted atmosphere.

 BODY:
AMES, Iowa - The Republican straw poll in Ames is usually anything but a somber event. 
Candidates bribe their supporters with promises of rock bands, competing styles of barbecue and many varieties of ice cream. They urge families to come and enjoy what the state's Republican chairman, Matt Strawn, on Monday called "part political convention, part carnival with a lot of craziness in between."
In 2007, Mike Huckabee played the banjo for votes.
But this year's event is taking place amid grim news that is overshadowing the typically lighthearted campaigning by candidates criss-crossing the state ahead of the event. The credit downgrade, the stock market plunge and the deaths of the Navy Seal commandos in Afghanistan are changing the conversation and providing fresh opportunities for criticism of President Obama.
The sharp decline in stocks and the decision by Standard & Poor's to lower the credit rating on the country's long-term debt were the first subjects that Tim Pawlenty was asked by reporters to address after an event in Ames.
"The downgrade and the market conditions are a reflection of some much deeper, bigger problems facing the country," he said. "We have got a president who is asleep at the switch on the most pressing financial challenges for this country."
Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, seized on a question about the decision by the credit ratings agency to bash Mr. Obama.
"The person who is responsible for the downgrade is sitting in the White House," Mr. Santorum said in an early morning event. "I don't know what the markets are doing this morning. My guess is they are not going to be happy. The impact on our economy from the president's failed leadership could be really epic."
The tragedy in Afghanistan has been a frequent topic, too, and one that all of the candidates feel an obligation to acknowledge.
"We should stop and reflect," Mr. Pawlenty told a small crowd in Ames. "We just lost 31 of our best members of the military over the last few days in Afghanistan. These are special operators they are representative of the kind of commitment and sacrifice and patriotism and service."
Campaigning in Iowa on Sunday, Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota bowed her head and led a prayer for the soldiers who lost their lives when a transport helicopter was shot down in Afghanistan on Saturday.
"A great tragic loss was endured yesterday," she prayed. "Father, we thank you for these brave men, these brave individuals, Father, who truly fulfilled the holy scripture that says 'greater love hath no man than this but that he lay down his life for his friend.'"
And everywhere on the trail, the specter of another day of 500-plus declines in the stock market added a sense of urgency to the campaigning.
Shortly after Mr. Obama made a statement from the White House on Monday, Mrs. Bachmann issued her own statement from her event in Atlantic, Iowa.
"After a weekend of hiding out at Camp David, pretending that the Standard and Poor's ratings do not matter and hoping the markets wouldn't notice, the president discovered he was wrong on both counts," she said. "Mr. President, the American people have spoken and now a credit ratings agency has echoed their message: your economic policies have failed."
All of which prompted a reporter to ask Mr. Strawn whether there is something a bit unseemly about the candidates spending lavishly on food and entertainment at the straw poll in the middle of an economic crisis.
"Those are decisions that each individual campaigns make on how they want to appropriate allocate resources, so I'll let them speak to that," Mr. Strawn said. "While maybe it's great that it will entertain the kids, and I encourage everyone to bring the families out, at the end of the day, Iowa Republicans are making their decisions based on which candidate connects with them on their solutions."
The candidates will likely continue with those traditions at the straw poll. But there is no doubt that the conversations with voters leading up to the festivities are heavier than they would have been a few weeks ago.
"At the end of the day it's going to be their ideas and their vision for America that's going to attract votes," Mr. Strawn said, "and not necessarily who has the best barbecue or the best entertainment."

HEADLINE: Pawlenty Courts Evangelicals in Make-or-Break Moment

BYLINE: GERRY MULLANY


HIGHLIGHT: Tim Pawlenty is appealing to evangelicals he seeks to rescue a flagging campaign by a strong performance at a debate in Iowa and straw poll two days later.

 BODY:
CLIVE, Iowa -- For the small gathering of Iowa faith leaders Monday night, Tim Pawlenty offered a mix of religion and get-it-done realism.
"The privileges, the liberties, the freedoms, the blessings that we enjoy," the former Minnesota governor said, "come from our creator, God." He added: "We want a candidate to emerge in this race who I think understands not just the values, not just the issues, but also the commitment to get it done."
As he heads toward a make-or-break moment for his presidential campaign this weekend, Mr. Pawlenty is not giving up on the evangelical voters who are so often the cornerstone of Republican victories here.
On Tuesday morning, he was the lone Republican presidential candidate to help kick off a 22-county tour by the "Value Voter Bus," thanking the evangelical activists for "standing for a culture of life." He has launched a website, Pawlentyfaith.com. And in between stops, he meets privately with the state's religious leaders. But he has an uphill battle as he scours Iowa for supporters who will cast a ballot at Saturday's straw poll. Michele Bachmann is courting the same voters and does so with gusto. During a Sunday event, she offered a long prayer for the soldiers who lost their lives in Afghanistan over the weekend.
"Bachmann is one, she has a certain pizzazz about her," said Bob Vander Plaats, the head of Iowa Family Leader, an important local faith group. But he added that Mr. Pawlenty has "reached out to this base very authentically and genuinely. He's probably more the tortoise in the race, but I think he's gaining ground as well."
Mr. Pawlenty's outreach to religious voters -- as well as home school advocates and pro-marriage activists -- is part of an urgent try-everything, try-anything strategy that his advisers hope will lead to a better-than-expected showing on Saturday. His advisers have said he must move from the "back of the pack to the front of the pack" in the straw poll.
Mr. Pawlenty is in the middle of an aggressive schedule of retail campaigning that is focused on the small towns within a half-hour of Ames, the site of the straw poll. While his rivals campaign in the far reaches of the state, Mr. Pawlenty is betting on the people most likely to make a short trip to Iowa State University, where the straw poll will be held.
His stump speech is earnest, emphatic and even angry at some points as he lashes at out President Obama, calling him "inept" and saying his presidency has been "misguided, misfocused, misprioritized, misdirected." Once he starts talking, he hardly takes a breath or gives the typically small audiences a chance to react or applaud.
Unlike Mrs. Bachmann, who seems to thrive on the energy of a crowd, Mr. Pawlenty does not seem to particularly enjoy campaigning. But ironically, his campaign, which lags in the polls and is struggling to raise money, is betting on his performances with these small gatherings of voters.
At stop after stop, he tells whoever will listen that they will hear similar promises from his rivals. But, he says, none of them have the executive experience he has.
"Any bobblehead can stand up here and give you the words of the Republican checklist. That doesn't take any particular talent," he told about two dozen people at Rich's Brew, a coffeehouse in Johnston, Iowa. "The question is have you actually done it?"
Mr. Pawlenty is careful not to say what specific "bobblehead" he is talking about. But it's clear from the context of his remarks that he is concerned about Mrs. Bachmann, who has surged in the polls in recent weeks.
Without naming her directly, Mr. Pawlenty is hoping to raise questions about the experience she would bring to confronting the nation's economic challenges. And to religious voters, he is hoping to make the case that her flash and pizzazz is less impressive than the steps he took as governor to back traditional marriage and oppose abortion.
"He has a record that social conservatives can rally behind," said Alex Conant, a senior adviser. "He doesn't just talk the talk, he walks the walk on issues of life, marriage and values."
At the launch of the values bus on Tuesday morning, Mr. Pawlenty stressed his credentials during brief remarks in front of activists and reporters on the steps of the Iowa state capitol building.
In Minnesota, one of the most challenging political environments in the country for a conservative, I was able to advance these issues," Mr. Pawlenty said. "We will ultimately win this cause and advance the culture of life in this country by winning over the hearts and minds of the people."
And then he added: "I hope that you'll come to Ames this Saturday to be part of the straw poll."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Phone Campaign Blames Democrats for Downgrade

BYLINE: JENNIFER STEINHAUER


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans are taking to the phone lines to blame Democrats for causing the S&#038;P downgrade of the nation's credit.

 BODY:
Republicans and Democrats moved quickly to blame each other publicly for causing the S&P downgrade of the nation's credit, and Republicans are now taking to the phone lines.
In automated calls in 10 Congressional Districts from California to New York, the National Republican Congressional Committee is trying to tar Democrats with the recent crisis in the markets. The call script also pushes the Balanced Budget Amendment, a cornerstone of Republican economic policy that will likely be voted on in both the House and Senate this fall. 
Speaker John A. Boehner is pushing his conference to talk about a potential budget amendment in their home districts during this recess. 
Here is the script as tailored for Representative Jason Altmire, Democrat of Pennsylvania:
"Hello, I'm calling from the National Republican Congressional Committee, 320 First Street SE, Washington, DC 20003, 202.479.7000, with an important recorded message about your Congressman Jason Altmire. Jason Altmire continues to oppose a Balanced Budget Amendment that would force Washington to live within its means. Jason Altmire and his fellow Democrats' addiction to big government spending has led to a downgrade of America's credit rating and a dramatic loss in the global markets that could force you to pay more for everyday expenses. While Jason Altmire keeps standing in the way of real fiscal reform, middle-class families in Pennsylvania could now see a loss in retirement savings while mortgage rates, car payments and student loans could become even more expensive. Call Congressman Jason Altmire at 202-225-2565 and tell him to stop his reckless borrowing spree. Paid for by the National Republican Congressional Committee. Not authorized by any candidate or candidate's committee."

HEADLINE: Disney Profits Beat Wall Street Predictions

BYLINE: BROOKS BARNES


HIGHLIGHT: The Walt Disney Company reported profits slightly above Wall Street's predictions on Tuesday.

 BODY:
After two wild quarters - leaping in the first and missing big in the second - the Walt Disney Company returned to its calm and collected ways on Tuesday, reporting profit slightly above Wall Street's predictions.
Disney, the world's largest media company, said net income for its fiscal third quarter rose to $1.48 billion, or 77 cents a share. That compares with income of $1.3 billion, or 67 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue climbed 7 percent, to $10.68 billion. Analysts had expected income of 73 cents a share.
But the big question for Disney centers on the coming months: if its sprawling theme parks in Florida and California are bellwethers for consumer confidence, as many investors believe, how are the gloomy financial markets and fears of a double-dip recession affecting bookings heading into the crucial holiday season?Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, was expected to address that question in a conference call with analysts late Tuesday afternoon. In May, when Mr. Iger last updated analysts on the company's theme parks, he offered a mixed picture, noting that future bookings were down 2.5 percent but pricing was slightly up.
Price increases, which reflect an end to promotional packages offered during the height of the recession, helped drive operating income at the company's parks up 9 percent, to $519 million, in the most recent quarter. Hong Kong Disneyland and the Disney Cruise Line also contributed to improved results, offset by Tokyo Disneyland, which continued to feel the impact of the March earthquake that hobbled Japan.
As usual, Disney's overall results were powered by its Media Networks division, which includes assets like ESPN, Disney Channel, the ABC broadcast network and local TV stations. Operating income in that unit rose 11 percent, to $2.09 billion, largely due to higher carriage payments for ESPN from cable providers.
Like other media conglomerates, Disney's television advertising revenue has rebounded, although ESPN's ad sales in the quarter were flat as higher rates were offset by the absence of World Cup games. Lower programming costs benefited ABC, where ad sales increased.
Highlighting the difficult economics of the movie business, operating income at Walt Disney Studios fell 60 percent, to $49 million, despite hits like "Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides" and "Thor." In the year-earlier quarter, Disney 's movie releases - "Toy Story 3" and "Iron Man 2" - were stronger ticket sellers; they were also cheaper to make and market.
Only a few days of ticket sales for "Cars 2" made it into the most recent quarter, which ended on July 2. But "Cars 2" did deliver a 32 percent increase in operating income, to $155 million, at the company's consumer products division.

HEADLINE: China Trade Surplus Rises Sharply

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's exports and imports both rose faster than expected in July, producing a trade surplus of $31.5 billion, the largest in more than two years, China's General Administration of Customs announced in Beijing on Wednesday morning. 
Exports jumped 20.4 percent from a year earlier, to $175.1 billion, as economic weakening in the United States and Europe seemed to have little immediate effect on demand for the wide range of manufactured consumer goods that are the mainstay of Chinese exports.
Imports climbed 22.9 percent from a year earlier, to $143.6 billion.
Exports and imports each grew more in July than June, belying recent corporate surveys in China that have suggested a weakening in export orders over the last three months.
Chinese officials are closely watching trade data for slowing as they try to cool the domestic economy in order to limit inflation, which reached 6.5 percent in July.

HEADLINE: Its Forecast Dim, Fed Vows To Keep Rates Near Zero

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve made a rare promise on Tuesday to hold short-term interest rates near zero through at least the middle of 2013, in a sign that it has all but written off the chances of an expansion strong enough to drive up wages and prices.
It is now conventional wisdom among forecasters that the economy will plod along through the end of President Obama's first term in office. Millions of Americans will not find work. Wages will not rise substantially.
By its action, the Fed is declaring that it, too, sees little prospect of rapid growth and little risk of inflation. Its hope is that the showman's gesture will spur investment and risk-taking by convincing markets that the cost of borrowing will not rise for at least two years. 
The Fed's statement, with its mix of grim tidings and welcome aid, contributed to wild market oscillations as investors struggled to make sense of the economy and the path ahead. The day ended in a huge upward surge on the New York Stock Exchange -- the second busiest day this year after the record volume on Monday, during a deep sell-off -- that could not be tallied completely until well after the markets had closed.
The Dow swung as much as 600 points in the wake of the Fed statement, at first sinking over 200 points. But after traders absorbed the decision, they quickly reversed course, and the Dow closed the day up 429 points, or 4 percent, to 11,239.77, as some investors expressed hope that the pledge to keep interest rates low could relieve some of the gloom over the economic outlook.
''The economy is in tough shape and the Fed had a difficult job of showing that they understood that without appearing to be alarmist,'' said Steven Lear, who helps to manage a $150 billion fixed-income portfolio for J.P. Morgan Asset Management. ''We think that they've played that hand about as well as they could.''
The policy announced Tuesday is an incremental step that economists described as unlikely to drive significant growth. The Fed already has held rates near zero since December 2008, and the economy is awash in cheap money. The great impediment, beyond the Fed's easy reach, is the lack of demand from indebted consumers, nervous businesses and a shrinking public sector.
The Fed demurred, however, from taking stronger steps to aid the struggling economy, a decision that reflected deepening divisions on its policy-making committee, which generally tries to move only by unanimous consent. The vote to promise two more years of low rates passed by a margin of 7 to 3, the first time in almost 20 years that at least three members recorded votes in dissent.
The internal controversy parallels the broader debate in Washington between those pleading for the government to redouble its support for the faltering economy, and those who doubt the utility of additional aid and fear the consequences of the vast efforts already made. The three Fed members in dissent all have expressed concern that the central bank is not paying enough attention to inflation.
The Fed said in a statement that it would continue to consider additional measures to support the economy, but the split vote suggested that the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, may struggle to win sufficient support.
The statement, which includes an assessment of the economy, was a patchwork quilt of discouraging language. The labor market is deteriorating, construction is weak, housing depressed, recovery slow.
''Economic growth so far this year has been considerably slower than the committee had expected,'' it said. ''The committee now expects a somewhat slower pace of recovery over coming quarters.''
Twenty-five million Americans cannot find full-time work, a number the Fed said would decline ''only gradually.''
The Fed is charged by Congress with minimizing unemployment, and increasingly vocal critics have questioned why the central bank is standing still even as the economy shows clear signs of faltering. The modest step announced Tuesday did not satisfy many of those critics.
''The Fed took the least action possible given the circumstances,'' Sherry Cooper, chief economist at the BMO Financial Group, said in a note to clients. ''Bottom Line: Holy Cow!''
In part, the Fed's answer is that it is already engaged in an immense program of economic aid.
The central bank has held its benchmark short-term interest rate near zero for more than two years, flooding the financial system with the nearest thing to free money. It already had promised, most recently in June, that it would keep rates near zero ''for an extended period'' -- at least several months, Mr. Bernanke said earlier this year.
The Fed also has amassed a portfolio of more than $2.5 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, putting downward pressure on long-term interest rates. The purchases have pushed investors into the stock market and other riskier investments, and reduced the value of the dollar, helping American exporters.
The decision announced Tuesday is intended to put additional pressure on long-term interest rates, although not with the same direct force as buying $600 billion in securities, a program it completed in June. The rates on long-term securities reflect a combination of expectations about short-term rates and a risk premium for holding a long-term note. Buying bonds reduces that risk premium; by promising to keep rates low, the Fed aims to reduce expectations about future short-term rates.
The Fed's statement stopped short of an absolute commitment to provide two years of near-zero rates, preserving some room for movement if economic conditions change drastically. But Vincent R. Reinhart, who headed the Fed's monetary affairs division until 2007, said the meaning was clear.
''It's as close to an unconditional commitment as you can get out of a central banker,'' said Mr. Reinhart, now a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ''It means that you've handcuffed yourself. You can't change it. You've given up unless there's an overwhelming case to offset inflation risk.''
A second reason for the Fed's restraint, it is increasingly clear, is the opposition of a group of Fed officials who are concerned that the central bank is overly discounting the risk of inflation.
The three members who dissented from the majority Tuesday were Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas; Narayana Kocherlakota, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis; and Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.
By law the Fed is responsible for keeping prices steady and unemployment as low as possible. But Mr. Bernanke, like his predecessors, places greater emphasis on prices, in part because the Fed has concluded that slow, steady inflation -- about 2 percent a year -- is the best atmosphere for enduring job growth.
The Fed projected in June that inflation could reach 2.5 percent this year, a crucial reason for its announcement then that it would pause before considering new measures.
There are now signs that inflation is abating, as a temporary spike in commodity prices earlier this year works through the economy, and as growth weakens. Mr. Bernanke and his allies on the committee have predicted as much all year, and the announcement on Tuesday reflects confidence in that judgment.
But conservative members of the policy-making board see evidence in past recoveries that inflation can accelerate quickly, with little warning. Their dissents echo the last time the committee was as deeply divided, in November 1992, when three members pressed to begin raising the short-term interest rate, which then stood at 3 percent.
The Fed's statement, indicating that it will continue to consider additional options despite those internal divisions, sets the stage for Mr. Bernanke's speech later this month at a conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Last year, he used the opportunity to indicate that the Fed would undertake a new round of asset purchases. ''The markets,'' Mr. Lear said, ''will be actively interested to hear what he says.''

HEADLINE: A Gritty Voice of the Workingman to Be Poet Laureate: Making A Rare Appearance: People and Their Appetites

BYLINE: By DWIGHT GARNER

 BODY:
Louis Untermeyer, who held the job we now call poet laureate from 1961 to 1963, spoke out against the idea that America's laureates should engage in literary boosterism. He felt that from his office armchair, he was merely ''meant to act as a poetic radiator, radiating a love of poetry over as many miles as possible.''
You might agree with Untermeyer. Or you may feel, as I do, that his lofty words impel you to ask (to quote Bob Dylan in ''Tombstone Blues''), ''Is there a hole for me to get sick in?'' Either way, the work of Philip Levine, America's new and 18th poet laureate, is welcome because it radiates a heat of a sort not often felt in today's poetry, that transmitted by grease, soil, factory light, cheap and honest food, sweat, low pay, cigarettes and second shifts. It is a plainspoken poetry ready-made, it seems, for a time of S&P downgrades, a double-dip recession and debts left unpaid. 
The book to buy, if you haven't read Mr. Levine, is ''What Work Is,'' which won a National Book Award in 1991. It won't give you the most rounded sense of his long and varied career, but it starts strong and, like a perfect rock record, won't quit. Mr. Levine was born in Detroit and worked in Cadillac and Chevy factories as a young man; his evocations of working-class life are moving and exacting.
Here's the beginning of ''Fear and Fame,'' which opens ''What Work Is'':
Half an hour to dress, wide rubber hip boots, gauntlets to the elbow, a plastic helmet like a knight's but with a little glass window that kept steaming over, and a respirator to save my smoke-stained lungs. I would descend step by slow step into the dim world of the pickling tank and there prepare the new solutions from the great carboys of acids lowered to me on ropes -- all from a recipe I shared with nobody and learned from Frank O'Mera before he went off to the bars on Vernor Highway to drink himself to death.
Mr. Levine's poems aren't lachrymose; they don't present blue-collar caricatures. Yet he speaks for people who are rarely given a voice in our poetry, and his poems feel, crucially, populated. Hello, Frank O'Mera. Elsewhere you'll meet Della and Tatum, Sweet Pea and Packy, Ida and Cal.
In a Paris Review interview in 1988, Mr. Levine was devastating -- and devastatingly funny -- about how unpeopled poetry has become. ''Except for the speaker, no one is there,'' he said. ''There's a lot of snow, a moose walks across the field, the trees darken, the sun begins to set, and a window opens. Maybe from a great distance you can see an old woman in a dark shawl carrying an unrecognizable bundle into the gathering gloom.''
When people do show up in poems, he added, they're Volvo-driving suburban mannequins. ''Their greatest terror,'' Mr. Levine said, ''is that they'll become like their parents and maybe do something dreadful, like furnish the house in knotty pine.''
One of the joys of following Mr. Levine's career has been watching how playful he can be, despite the moral seriousness of his unadorned and lightly accented verse. For years the biographical notes in his books included a sentence that began, ''After a succession of stupid jobs ...'' He has titled a poem ''He Would Never Use One Word Where None Would Do.'' In an essay, ''Keats in Detroit,'' that ran on The New York Times Op-Ed page in 1995, he observed: ''half the women I went to school with carried themselves as though they yearned to become professional bowlers.''
In a poem called ''Facts,'' also in ''What Work Is,'' he gives the following sardonic advice:
If you take a '37 Packard grill and split it down the center and reduce the angle by 18degrees and reweld it, you'll have a perfect grill for a Rolls Royce just in case you ever need a new grill for yours.
Mr. Levine was born in 1928 to Russian-Jewish immigrants (he once referred to himself as ''a dirty Detroit Jew with bad manners''), and he has sometimes been criticized for leaning too hard on his blue-collar bona fides. The critic Adam Kirsch, writing in The Times Book Review in 1999, noted, accurately enough, that ''in his autobiographical essays he goes out of his way to tell us that he is essentially a peasant.''
Yet Mr. Levine has lived in Spain and has translated the work of Pablo Neruda and Cesar Vallejo, among others, and has edited a volume of Keats's poems. He's no Bukowski. Mr. Levine once said: ''I'm so weary of that anti-intellectual stance: I'm just standing here suckin' on a beer writin' these lines until the pool room opens. I love intelligent poetry -- Stevens, Ammons, Tom Sleigh, Robert Morgan.''
His relaxed, come-as-you-are language has attracted sharks too. The critic Helen Vendler has asked about Mr. Levine's verse, ''Is there any compelling reason why it should be called poetry?'' Speaking about his work, Mr. Levine has been direct about his unpretentious diction. His ideal poem, he has said, is one in which ''no words are noticed.''
''You look through them into a vision of ... the people, the place,'' he continued.
Mr. Levine, it should be added, is a first-rate poet of the appetites, and his work is packed, like a paper sack, with salami sandwiches, apples, beer cans, a bit of heartburn, some gin. A poem called ''Salts and Oils'' begins: ''In Havana in 1948 I ate fried dog/believing it was Peking Duck.''
Billy Collins, the poet laureate from 2001 to 2003, described Howard Nemerov's observation that ''the poet laureate was expected to devote his tenure to explaining to others what it is exactly that the poet laureate does.''
Let's hope the talented Mr. Levine, in an unsettled time, gets more said than that.

HEADLINE: Two Marriott Brands Are to Share Space In Manhattan Tower

BYLINE: By JANE L. LEVERE

 BODY:
Construction will start soon on one of New York's largest hotel projects, a 68-story high-rise at the northwest corner of Broadway and 54th Street with more than 600 rooms, according to officials of Granite Broadway Development and Marriott International.
The project, in the works for at least a decade, will include a 378-room Courtyard by Marriott hotel and a 261-room Residence Inn by Marriott hotel, to be known as the Courtyard and Residence Inn Manhattan/Central Park. 
Operated under a franchise agreement between Granite Broadway Development and Marriott International, the hotels will be managed by Interstate Hotels and Resorts and are expected to open in late 2013.
Company officials planned to announce the project Wednesday.
John Fox, a senior vice president in New York of PKF Consulting USA, a hotel consulting company, said the two hotels combined would be the largest new hotel project in New York since the 863-room Westin New York at Times Square opened in 2002 at the southeast corner of Eighth Avenue and 43rd Street. A 607-room Intercontinental hotel opened last year at 300 West 44th Street.
Granite Broadway Development and Marriott say the new building will be the tallest in New York used strictly for lodging. Mr. Fox said this claim was accurate, noting that the new Marriott building, expected to reach almost 753 feet, would exceed the height of the Four Seasons Hotel on the north side of 57th Street between Madison and Park Avenues, which is 52 stories, or 682 feet high.
Marriott has 33 properties, including furnished apartments, under nine brands in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. Of the hotels, it manages approximately half, while the others are franchised. According to David Marriott, chief operations officer for the company's eastern region, the Americas, New York is Marriott's second-largest revenue generator in the United States, after Washington; the New York Marriott Marquis is the company's top revenue generator worldwide.
The Gross family, which owns Granite Broadway Development, owns five Marriott hotels, one in Philadelphia; one in Ghent, Belgium; and three in New York: the Courtyard New York JFK Airport, the Courtyard New York Manhattan/Times Square South and the Residence Inn Manhattan/Times Square.
When construction on the Residence Inn Manhattan/Times Square began in 2004, Harry Gross, the president of Granite Broadway Development, said he planned to start building another Marriott hotel at 54th Street and Broadway in 2005.
Although Mr. Gross declined to be interviewed about the new project, documents from the New York City Department of Finance show the Gross family bought three lots on the northwest corner of 54th Street and Broadway in 2001, and later acquired development rights, using available space from two lots on the southwest corner of 55th Street and Broadway.
Designed by Nobutaka Ashihara, the tower will have a main entrance and arrival lobby on West 54th Street; the lobby for the Residence Inn will be on the building's third floor, and the Courtyard lobby will be on the fourth floor. Courtyard guest rooms will be on floors 6 through 32, while Residence Inn rooms will be on floors 36 through 64; each hotel will have its own elevator banks.
The project will include ground-floor retail space; a leased restaurant on the second floor; a lounge and terrace with outdoor seating and views of Broadway on the fifth floor; and a fitness center, for use by guests of both hotels, on the 34th floor.
The lobby of the Courtyard, whose brand is geared to business travelers, will have a contemporary design, flexible space and what Marriott calls a GoBoard, a 55-inch interactive touch screen where guests can obtain local information and news headlines. The Residence Inn, an extended-stay hotel, will offer guests suites with kitchens. Since the Residence Inn will sit above the Courtyard, Marriott officials said it would also offer the project's best views of the city and Central Park.
Hotel industry experts expect the project to do well, despite the recent surge in the number of hotels in the New York market. According to Smith Travel Research, a lodging research company, there are 544 hotels, with about 100,500 rooms, in the New York metropolitan statistical area, including 33 that have opened in the last 12 months, with about 5,700 rooms.
An additional 171 hotels, with a total of about 20,700 rooms, are in construction or in various stages of planning, not all of which will open. These figures do not include the two new Marriott hotels.
Mr. Fox said he expected that demand for rooms in New York would continue to be very strong, and he predicted room rates would regain their 2008 peak by 2013.
Bjorn Hanson, the divisional dean of the Preston Robert Tisch Center for Hospitality, Tourism and Sports Management at New York University, said the two Marriott hotels could reduce their annual operating expenses by more than 5 percent by sharing one building, facilities like the fitness center, management and administrative staff, and departments like housekeeping and marketing.
He also said the new project's visibility because of its location and height would be a competitive advantage, ''the equivalent of numerous billboards without the expense.''
One hurdle the project could face, aside from the economy, is development delays. As Mr. Marriott said, ''There is always a construction challenge or two when you build in New York.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Surge as a Fed Statement Sinks In: Central Bank Props Up Spain and Italy, for Now

BYLINE: By JACK EWING AND RAPHAEL MINDER; Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt and Raphael Minder from Madrid.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- The European Central Bank has succeeded at least temporarily in pushing down the effective interest rates on Spanish and Italian government debt. But analysts say the bank must still convince investors that it has the stamina to withstand what could be a long struggle against market turmoil.
Spanish and Italian bond prices rose and their yields fell on Tuesday after the central bank stepped in for a second day to buy their sovereign debt, part of expanded efforts to prevent the European debt crisis from deepening in two of the largest economies in the euro currency zone.
The central bank's move, much more ambitious than its previous forays into the bond market, has set off a debate about how far the bank legally can go under its charter. According to bank insiders and analysts, the answer seems to be: as far as it wants. 
But the bigger questions may be how much intervention the central bank's balance sheet can sustain -- and how much help it will get from European governments. The pan-European bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Facility, is politically loaded and months away from having new money brought to a vote by member nations in the euro area.
In late trading Tuesday, the yield on Spain's benchmark 10-year government bonds was down an additional 0.1 percentage point, at 5.019 percent. It had reached a record high of 6.458 percent on Aug. 2. The yield on 10-year Italian bonds, meanwhile, fell Tuesday to a one-month low of 5.143 percent.
To keep Spanish and Italian bond yields at sustainable levels over the long term will be a huge challenge for the European Central Bank, as investors test the bank's resolve.
''Once they have started buying it will be difficult to stop buying,'' said Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland.
As it has when buying Greek bonds in the past, analysts say, the central bank will probably portray its interventions as a means to maintain control over interest rates and hold down inflation -- not as a rescue of any particular country, which is forbidden by treaty.
And analysts expect the bank to make a show of taking as much money out of circulation as it spends buying bonds, to avoid the appearance the central bank is printing money or flooding the economy with cash through so-called quantitative easing of the sort the United States Federal Reserve has resorted to in recent years.
On Tuesday in Washington, the Federal Reserve stopped well short of such a move, instead indicating it would keep rates low through mid-2013. But it said it might again resort to quantitative easing, if economic conditions did not improve.
The European Central Bank, too, is loath to acknowledge any limitations on its monetary policy arsenal. And, in the worst case, it might even engage in quantitative easing if it saw signs of deflation.
''We do what we judge necessary to be sure that we deliver price stability,'' Jean-Claude Trichet, the president of the central bank, said last week, repeating a phrase he has used often.
Confronted by a fundamental threat to the euro or to Europe's banking system, the central bank might have no choice but to take further action.
''They will do whatever it takes because they will be forced to,'' Mr. Cailloux said. ''There are no technical impediments to buying unlimited amounts'' of bonds, he added.
But that might require effectively printing money. Previously the central bank has intervened only in the much smaller markets for Greek, Portuguese and Irish bonds, spending 74 billion euros ($105 billion).
Some analysts say the bank may need to spend more than 10 times that to maintain control over yields on Spanish and Italian debt. If so, it might have trouble fully offsetting the purchases by paying banks interest to park money at the central bank, as it has done so far.
The bank's purchases of Spanish and Italian bonds on Monday and Tuesday, reported by traders but not officially confirmed by the central bank, came amid broader market turmoil after Standard & Poor's downgrading of American debt late Friday.
The central bank felt forced to respond because last week the cost of borrowing for both Spain and Italy soared to record highs, with yields on their 10-year bonds topping 6 percent -- a level that could raise the countries' interest payments to ruinous levels and threaten to undermine the entire euro union.
And despite the bank's efforts, there were growing signs on Tuesday of heightened tensions in the banking system. Money market indicators showed that European banks' reluctance to lend to one another was approaching levels not seen since the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in 2008.
The central bank has acknowledged these tensions. Last week it expanded the low-cost loans it offers to banks to ensure they have enough cash to conduct operations. Mr. Trichet said last week that he wanted European governments to take over the bond buying, as they had agreed to do through the stability fund. But the fund may not have enough money to intervene successfully in the huge Italian and Spanish bond markets, and it is not clear that all 17 euro area members will provide the necessary authority.
Mr. Trichet also insisted that European governments do more to reduce debt and remove regulations and bureaucracy that impede growth, particularly in countries like Italy and Greece. ''The governments have to do their job,'' Mr. Trichet said at a news conference last week. ''This is absolutely fundamental.''
Uri Dadush, an analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, argues, as do several other economists, that the financial crisis is becoming too big for any one central bank or government to manage and that they must coordinate their efforts. There are signs that leaders are poised to act if necessary.
On Sunday, officials from the Group of 7 nations -- including Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke -- held a conference call and issued a statement afterward saying they were ready to ''take all necessary measures to support financial stability and growth.''
Mr. Trichet has not signaled any impending coordinated effort but often emphasizes his ties to Mr. Bernanke. ''We always have a very close relationship with our sister institutions everywhere in the world,'' Mr. Trichet said last week.
Anemic economic growth data from Spain and Italy has amplified worries that politically weak governments in Madrid and Rome will not manage to clean up their public finances as quickly as previously promised. Spain grew 0.2 percent in the second quarter, less than expected.
But Elena Salgado, the Spanish finance minister, insisted Tuesday that Spain was on track to meet its fiscal targets this year. ''Spain's fundamentals show we are very far from requiring a bailout,'' Ms. Salgado told Onda Cero, a Spanish radio station.

HEADLINE: 10 Years and a Diagnosis Later, 9/11 Demons Haunt Thousands

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS; Alain Delaqueriere contributed research.

 BODY:
In the safety of her therapist's office in late 2001, Dr. Margaret Dessau made a tape reliving what it was like to look out her living room window after she heard the boom of a hijacked plane eight blocks away.
Running naked from her bath, she saw pigeons and paper flying through the air. ''It's kind of beautiful in a way,'' she recalls on the recording she made and listened to over and over as part of her treatment. ''There's these silver pieces just floating in the air.''
Her gaze met the hole in the tower. ''The flames get worse, and then I start seeing all these people hanging out there. The guy with this white towel, and he's waving it.''
He jumps. Children at a nearby school scream. 
''How are you feeling?'' her therapist, David Bricker, is heard asking on the tape.
''I start crying,'' she replies.
Dr. Dessau's husband yells at her, ''Stop looking at it, stop looking at it.'' But, she says, ''I can't tear myself away from it.''
One measure of the psychological impact of 9/11 is this: At least 10,000 firefighters, police officers and civilians exposed to the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center have been found to have post-traumatic stress disorder, and in a kind of mass grieving, many of them have yet to recover, according to figures compiled by New York City's three 9/11 health programs.
In interviews over the last several months, Dr. Dessau and others revealed a wide-ranging but consistent body of symptoms. They cannot sleep. They replay the disaster in their minds, or in their nightmares. They have trouble concentrating. They are jittery and overreact to alarms or loud noises. They feel helpless, hopeless, guilty and cut off from the people who are close to them. They avoid anything that reminds them of that terrible day.
Millions of dollars will be spent treating them over the next few years through the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Act, passed by Congress in December, which provides $4.3 billion to compensate and treat people with 9/11-related illnesses.
Some are emergency responders and others who vainly searched the debris for survivors. But some were residents, commuters and office workers caught in the dust cloud. And others were passive witnesses with no direct connection to the attack other than proximity.
Because of lingering questions about the bounds of the PTSD diagnosis, which is only three decades old, people with mental problems are eligible only for treatment assistance, whereas people with physical ailments, in most cases breathing difficulties, qualify for both treatment and compensation. And money available to treat patients with the stress disorder might decline if the government concludes there is a link between certain cancers and 9/11, which would give cancer patients access to the same pool of money. Doctors are expecting a surge in PTSD patients with the coming 10th anniversary, as they have on each Sept. 11.
Charles Figley, professor of disaster mental health at Tulane University's School of Social Work and a former Marine, advanced the concept of PTSD in a 1978 book on Vietnam War veterans. He said one reason the trauma had been so hard to shake was that it ripped at the most ordinary fabric of daily life.
The landmark is not a distant hill in Afghanistan that one will never see again. ''It's the places you see every day, where you proposed to your wife, where you remember getting the news that you got promoted, where your young children played,'' Dr. Figley said.
''You go into a combat zone and then you leave,'' he added. ''You don't leave home. You return all the time.''
Ancient but Evolving Illness
''The Iliad'' described warriors consumed by feelings of guilt, rage and grief. World War I had ''shell shock,'' and World War II had ''combat fatigue.'' PTSD has been found in survivors of Nazi concentration camps, fires and railway accidents. But it was not until 1980, after the Vietnam War, that post-traumatic stress disorder was added to the psychiatric bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.
The current manual, the DSM-IV, says PTSD can develop through a range of exposures to death or injury: direct personal involvement, witnessing it or, if it concerns someone close, just learning about it. Almost no other psychiatric diagnosis has generated as much controversy, according to Dr. Robert L. Spitzer, a retired psychiatry professor from Columbia University and an expert in mental disorder classifications. It has become so vague that stressed-out college students and people who watched horror movies could fit the profile, he and two other experts wrote in a professional journal article.
''It's a way of saying something terrible has happened to me and I've been damaged in some way, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's an illness,'' Dr. Spitzer, who advocates tightening the criteria, said in an interview.
Some experts have been skeptical of studies finding that people suffered the disorder from watching television coverage of the Sept. 11 attacks. (Congress effectively excluded TV watchers from its treatment program by requiring that victims had lived or worked within certain geographic boundaries.)
Amy Cushing-Savvi, a social worker at Mount Sinai Medical Center, which runs the largest program, said a frequent topic at staff meetings was, ''What's 9/11 and what isn't?'' -- in other words, the exquisitely vexing question of how to separate the effects of 9/11 from the traumas of everyday life.
''Taxpayers could end up paying for psychotherapy for Woody Allen and half of Manhattan,'' Theodore H. Frank, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, testified before the House Judiciary Committee in April 2008, when he was a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute.
Ultimately, federal financing for PTSD treatment was limited to firefighters, police officers, employees of the New York City medical examiner's office who handled body parts, and other rescue, recovery, cleanup and support workers at ground zero, on the barges that carried debris and at the Staten Island landfill where the twin towers rubble was entombed; responders at the attack sites at the Pentagon and Shanksville, Pa.; and people exposed to 9/11 dust when the buildings collapsed or who lived, worked or attended school south of Houston Street in Manhattan and in parts of Downtown Brooklyn where the dust may have extended.
Family members of New York City firefighters who died are covered as a continuation of an existing Fire Department counseling program, but family members of other victims are not. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York and the lead sponsor of the Zadroga Act in the House, said that since victims' families had been covered by the original 9/11 compensation fund, which paid an average of $2.1 million to each family, the goal was to look after others who suffered. ''We were focusing on covering the people who did not die on 9/11, but those who were dying and sick because of 9/11,'' she said.
The law was named after a New York police detective who took part in the rescue efforts and later developed breathing complications. The cause of his death in 2006 became a source of debate.
Dr. John Howard, who oversees 9/11 programs as the director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, said in an interview that he was willing to give people the benefit of the doubt about PTSD, even if they had other stresses. ''Collapsing 220 stories of a lot of material in one of the most densely populated cities in the world is a very unique event,'' Dr. Howard said.
''In mental health you have to treat the whole person, and you can't really separate out some of these other influences, personal stressors, economic issues. People are living their lives.''
''It sounds squishy,'' he added, ''but it really isn't squishy.''
Her World Collapses
For Dr. Dessau, who is now 64, listening to the tapes she made during therapy conquered her fears for a while, ''like cod liver oil,'' she said. But in 2009, her sense of tragedy was compounded when her husband, Bob Wheeler, died just four months after being told he had lung cancer.
Dr. Dessau, a youthful, athletic blonde with blue-rimmed green eyes, still lives in the same airy loft on Greenwich Street, decorated with souvenirs of 35 years of travel with Mr. Wheeler -- shells arranged in bowls, a child-size winged Hermes, a many-limb stone goddess, a terra cotta Chinese statue of a man. There is also a green plastic box containing her husband's ashes.
Mr. Wheeler, a lawyer, never smoked, so Dr. Dessau, a pulmonologist, suspected that his disease was related to his exposure to the falling buildings. His quick death revived the sense of helplessness she had felt watching people jump from the towers. ''As a doctor you always think you can fix it,'' she said.
She lost 20 pounds. She stopped seeing friends. She was ''on red alert,'' sure that something bad would happen at any second. She avoids looking at the skyline outside her window, though her reaction is not as bad since buildings have begun to fill in the space where the World Trade Center used to be.
A city fund set up before the Zadroga Act was enacted provided $9,000 to Dr. Dessau to cover therapy expenses not handled by her insurance. The city sent a letter encouraging her to seek further treatment through a public program that would allow the Zadroga money to cover her out-of-pocket expenses, but she prefers her own therapist.
She sees 9/11 and her husband's death as part of a continuum, along with her parents' escape from Nazi Germany, the suicide of a close relative and her time preparing bandages as a student in Israel during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. ''It confirms my sense of pessimism,'' she said. ''It's corroboration of the evil of human beings.''
That sense of 9/11 as a catalyst is common. In June, Stanley Mieses, 58, a freelance writer and editor, lined up with other psychiatric patients at the city-run Elmhurst Hospital Center under a sign that said, as if testing his sanity: New atient Registrati n.
During a screening, he circled the maximum, ''nearly every day,'' to a question about how often he had been ''feeling bad about yourself -- or that you are a failure or have let yourself or your family down.''
Mr. Mieses, who is receiving treatment under the Zadroga Act, lived six and a half blocks from the trade center and watched the buildings collapse. The police evacuated him, but he returned every few days to feed his cats. ''Dead people were blowing into my apartment off the windowsills,'' he said, remembering the ash, ''because the landlord was too cheap to clean it.''
For a while he sublimated his anxiety, filing reports for NPR from his stunned neighborhood. But in short order, his mother, a World War II German refugee with what he said were her own PTSD issues, died; his girlfriend left him; work dried up; and he was forced by his finances to move to Jackson Heights, Queens.
These psychic blows led, he said, to ''a change in my attitude, a change in my -- I don't know -- joie de vivre.''
His pulmonologist at Elmhurst says his shortness of breath could be from the dust, or the 20 years he smoked. The origins of his mental wounds are also ambiguous. ''I tend to think of 9/11 as the trapdoor that opened up,'' Mr. Mieses said. ''Whatever else I'm doing past that, is climbing back up.''
A Number Unknown
It is impossible to say how many people have 9/11-related PTSD. The city's three official programs do not count people, like Dr. Dessau, who use private physicians -- or those who have not been treated at all.
According to figures provided by the programs, run by the Fire Department, which treats its own employees; a consortium of hospitals led by Mount Sinai Medical Center, which treats police officers and other rescue and recovery workers; and the city's public hospital system, which treats civilians, at least 10,000 patients have met the criteria over the last decade, and at least 3,600 of them still have symptoms. But even those rounded numbers have an asterisk: 3,000 of the 10,000 patients were treated by the public hospitals, whose statistics do not differentiate among PTSD, depression and anxiety. The Zadroga program covers all three, along with panic disorder, substance abuse and a few other conditions.
Extrapolating from a registry of people exposed to the attack, the city's health department has estimated that 61,000 of the 409,000 in the disaster area experienced ''probable'' PTSD within six years of 9/11. But these numbers were produced by institutions and a city government with two main goals: to make as many people as possible feel better, and to try to persuade Congress to provide a steady stream of treatment money. The city's 9/11 health programs have created a huge intake system that screens every patient for mental as well as physical illness, and the public hospitals reached out to New Yorkers with subway advertisements that said: ''Lived there? Worked there? You deserve care.''
No one can say exactly how many people were exposed to the attack, and how many will eventually become physically or mentally sick. The federal government will allow the Mount Sinai and public hospitals programs to grow by 25,000 patients each over the next five years. It will be up to each program to decide who qualifies for treatment, but they will have to use uniform criteria approved by the government. Therapy can cost $135 for a 45-minute weekly session with a psychologist or $165 with a psychiatrist.
If the government finds a link between 9/11 dust and cancer, there is some concern about running out of money, though the Zadroga fund is to be a secondary payment source, covering what insurance and workers' compensation do not.
Dr. Howard, the federal 9/11 health administrator, said the government ''will treat people as they come in to the extent possible.''
Alarms, Over and Over
Patients at Mount Sinai find a busy warren of rooms where they are divided into three categories: green (no further assessment needed), yellow (potentially symptomatic) and red (symptoms so severe that they might be suicidal). They begin the screening at home, filling out an 11-page questionnaire that asks about their level of energy, how often they feel ''calm and peaceful,'' and about recent life experiences like losing a job or having a relationship break up. In a section called ''Reminders of 9/11,'' they are asked whether they have recurring thoughts of the disaster and whether they feel emotionally cut off from those close to them.
In an interview with a clinician, they are asked whether ''you often believe it would be better if you were dead,'' ''you feel worthless'' or ''you feel guilty even though you didn't deserve to feel that way.''
If they have PTSD, patients are usually given a combination of psychotherapy and pills, typically antidepressants, and sometimes sleeping pills. Many patients are encouraged to make recordings of their memories, as Dr. Dessau did, or to write about them until the memories lose their power. This is called exposure therapy.
Once a month, Earl Holland drives from his home in Flatlands, Brooklyn, to Mount Sinai for meditation classes. ''You get in a room, the chimes are going, it's fantastic,'' Mr. Holland said. He also takes Wellbutrin, an antidepressant, and Ambien, a sleeping pill.
Mr. Holland, 48, was a paramedic supervisor for North Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System when he responded to the disaster after the second tower collapsed. In his dreams, he still hears the alarms -- attached to each firefighter's mask -- that signal that a firefighter has stopped moving. ''There were hundreds of alarms going off,'' he said, grabbing a tissue to wipe away the tears as he sat in his kitchen, remembering.
''I kept the list'' of the missing, he said.
Two months after the attacks, he responded to the crash of American Airlines Flight 587 in Belle Harbor, Queens.
He started shutting himself in his bedroom, refusing to talk to his wife and children. He spent hours staring at photographs of the burning rubble and had flashbacks of responding to murders during the 1980s crack epidemic.
''Toward the end, I didn't want to do my calls,'' he said. ''It was like, enough. I actually thought it was burnout, but it wasn't burnout.''
Mr. Holland's diagnosis of PTSD was made in 2009 through a Mount Sinai outreach program, and his costs will be covered by the Zadroga Act.
He has recovered enough that he hopes to return to work, but not on the front lines. ''I don't know if I'll go to the memorial any time soon,'' he said. ''I look at that kind of as closure, if I'm able to do that.''

HEADLINE: Cuomo Weighs Ending State Limits on Casino Gambling

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, suggesting it was time for the state to ''come to grips'' with the proliferation of gambling in New York and neighboring states, said Tuesday that he was weighing the legalization of commercial, non-Indian casinos in New York State.
Mr. Cuomo's comments come as the state's racetrack casinos, which have electronic slot machines but not the more lucrative table games, prepare to mount a high-profile lobbying effort to push the State Legislature to let them expand into full-fledged casinos. 
The governor said his administration was ''actively'' investigating whether full-scale commercial gambling should be legalized in the state, a move that would quite likely draw significant public disagreement but could offer huge financial benefits for the state and be a source of upstate jobs.
''It's really not an issue anymore of 'Well, if we don't officially sanction it as a government, it's not going to happen,' '' Mr. Cuomo said at a news conference in Albany. ''It is happening.''
''So now you have to go to the second step,'' he added. ''If there is going to be gaming, how should it be done? And that issue, that question, is an important question for the state.''
New York has five Indian-run casinos, all of them upstate. Limited electronic gambling is permitted at so-called racinos at eight tracks and is set to begin at a ninth, the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens, later this year.
The State Constitution prohibits other forms of commercial gambling, and amending the Constitution would be the biggest roadblock. Passing an amendment requires approval from two consecutive Legislatures, followed by a public referendum.
But New York State would stand to gain significant revenue from lifting the ban. The state expects to earn $684 million this year from its share of the revenue from the racinos; allowing them to expand into full-blown casinos would substantially raise that figure.
Seeking to allow the racinos to expand, or for new commercial casinos to be built, would most likely draw stiff opposition from opponents of legalized gambling and from the state's Indian tribes, who would see their gambling facilities face more competition.
The Oneida Indian Nation, which operates the Turning Stone casino in the Mohawk Valley, noted the relatively cumbersome process to amend the Constitution and suggested it was hardly a certain avenue for the Cuomo administration to pursue.
Mark F. Emery, an Oneida spokesman, said the Cuomo administration might instead ''bring gaming to the state promptly and assuredly under already-existing laws by working closely with its in-state Indian nations to enjoy immediate revenue sharing, which would benefit the entire state.''
Previous governors grappled with what to do about casinos. Lawmakers in the 1990s began the process of approving an amendment to end the ban on gambling, but support for the proposal evaporated before it could pass the Legislature a second time.
More recently, a measure to allow five commercial casinos to open upstate passed the State Senate last year but was not considered in the State Assembly, and the proposal was not brought up in the legislative session that ended in June.
But lawmakers are planning to make another push beginning in the legislative session that starts in January, and they have said Cuomo administration staff members have privately signaled an openness to considering a constitutional amendment that would allow for commercial casinos.
State Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican from Orange County, is chairman of two committees that deal with casino issues -- the Judiciary Committee and the Racing, Gaming and Wagering Committee. He has scheduled hearings for September to discuss how to proceed on the issue of casinos.
''They haven't been giving me any direction,'' Mr. Bonacic said Tuesday of the governor's office, ''but at the same time they haven't discouraged me.''
Mr. Bonacic said he was heartened by Mr. Cuomo's interest in considering the possibility of commercial casinos, as was Assemblyman J. Gary Pretlow, a Democrat from Westchester County who is chairman of the Assembly Racing and Wagering Committee.
''I'm hoping that he sees it in a positive light and we can move forward,'' Mr. Pretlow said, ''because I think it would be an economic boon for the State of New York.''
In June, Mr. Cuomo appointed Bennett Liebman, a former commissioner of the New York State Racing and Wagering Board, as his gambling adviser; aides to the governor said Mr. Liebman had been given the task of undertaking a broad review of all gambling in the state, including horse racing, Indian-run casinos and the lottery.
The nine racetrack casinos, meanwhile, have banded together to start the New York Gaming Association, which is expected to begin advocating for a constitutional amendment later this year.
Among its backers is Genting New York, a subsidiary of the largest gambling company in England and Southeast Asia, which paid a $380 million upfront licensing fee last year for the right to install 4,525 video slot machines at the Aqueduct racetrack, which it would like to turn into a full-fledged casino.

HEADLINE: Timely Help for the Port Authority

 BODY:
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York have both expressed concern about the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey's proposed 50 percent increase in bridge and tunnel tolls -- from $8 to $12 as soon as next month, with another $2 jump in three years. Mr. Cuomo called the increase a ''nonstarter'' but promised to study it. Mr. Christie said his first reaction was: ''You're kidding, right?'' 
It is hard to imagine that either governor was taken by surprise because the two officials essentially control the authority, which manages not only bridges and tunnels but also the area's ports, airports and the former World Trade Center site. Let's hope this is nothing more than the usual gubernatorial theatrics because the authority has a challenging agenda and needs help.
The authority has come a long way from its highly politicized past and in recent years has streamlined operations and trimmed personnel -- 12.5 percent in 7 years. Yet it has suffered financially as the economy weakened and fewer people commuted to Manhattan. Additional revenues would help the authority protect its bond rating and pay for a $33 billion, 10-year capital plan. That, in turn, would make possible a host of critically important projects: finishing the public works part of the World Trade Center site by 2015; replacing the suspender ropes on the 80-year-old George Washington Bridge and the spiral roadway that leads to the Lincoln Tunnel in New Jersey; enhancing security at regional airports; maintaining a transportation network that feeds the entire region.
The authority's board is expected to vote next week on these increases. Either governor can veto the whole package, a move that would be certain to gain headlines at the expense of the entire region. A better choice would be a $2 increase now for most cars and another $2 increase in 2014. Instead of hitting PATH riders with an immediate $1 increase in the base fare (to $2.75), the authority should phase it in over the next few years. That would spare commuters. It should also work politically for the governors.

HEADLINE: Massachusetts Settles Suit Against a Mortgage Lender

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
BOSTON (AP) -- Mortgages will be adjusted for thousands of Massachusetts homeowners and black and Latino borrowers will be reimbursed for high fees in a settlement with a subprime lender that the state accused in a lawsuit of unfair and discriminatory lending practices.
The lender, Option One, now known as Sand Canyon, agreed to make loan modifications valued at $115 million to homeowners facing foreclosure, Martha Coakley, the Massachusetts attorney general, announced on Tuesday. The lender is a subsidiary of H&R Block. 
An investigation by Ms. Coakley's office found that from 2004 through 2007 the mortgage lender issued risky loans that did not document borrowers' incomes to confirm they could afford the loans.
Some loans were based on a borrower's ability to pay the introductory interest rates instead of the long-term rate.
''They employed a business model that absolutely failed to gauge the ability of borrowers to repay the loans,'' Ms. Coakley said. ''In other words, they knew or should have known that those loans were going to fail.''
Nearly 5,500 homeowners could get some relief on their loan payments under the settlement.
Option One will direct American Home Mortgage Servicing, which services the loans, to lower monthly payments, interest rates and the principal balance owed on loans for borrowers who are delinquent on payments by 45 days or more. The adjustments are intended to lower monthly payments to 31 to 36 percent of a borrower's monthly income.
Ms. Coakley said 2,361 homeowners were already eligible for the modifications, and estimated an additional 3,105 could become eligible in the next 18 months. Option One issued 32,400 loans in the state from 2004 through 2007.
About 3,000 black and Latino borrowers will also be repaid for broker fees that were about $400 to $500 higher than the fees for white borrowers in similar financial situations.
Ms. Coakley said her investigation found ''intentional discrimination'' against minority borrowers, and the lawsuit filed in 2008 was the first in the nation making civil rights claims against a subprime lender.
These reimbursements and others will come from $9.8 million Option One agreed to pay the state.
''We are pleased with the final outcome and believe this is good for all parties involved,'' Dale Sugimoto, president of Sand Canyon, said in a statement. The settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing.
Ms. Coakley said her office received 164 complaints about the mortgage lender leading to its investigation and lawsuit filed in 2008, and 834 homes were foreclosed on before her office intervened.
''We will not be able to return to a healthy economy here in Massachusetts and in this country until we are able to address and get under control foreclosures,'' Ms. Coakley said.
She said she would use money from the settlement to provide grants to communities particularly affected by foreclosures. A majority of the foreclosures for Option One borrowers were in nine cities across the state, including Boston, Lowell, New Bedford and Springfield.
Helping hard-hit communities and homeowners battling foreclosure is important to level the ''unevenness of the playing field,'' said Grace Ross, coordinator of the Massachusetts Alliance Against Predatory Lending.
Ms. Ross applauded Ms. Coakley's work, but said the states could not go only after individual bad actors.
Instead, they should use settlements to help pay legal fees for homeowners who might not benefit directly from a settlement or to help communities that have lost tax revenue and where property values have declined because of many foreclosures. The possible grants from the settlement could address the bigger issues, Ms. Ross said.

HEADLINE: S.&P., Accused of Faulty Math in Downgrade, Fights Error Disclosure Rule

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Three days after Treasury Department officials discovered what they called a mistake in the assumptions used by Standard & Poor's to justify the downgrade of United States debt, the president of S.& P. wrote to securities regulators saying that ratings agencies should not be required to publicly disclose all errors in their calculations.
In a letter to the Securities and Exchange Commission dated Monday, Deven Sharma, the president of S.& P., said that while it believed the company should disclose ''significant errors'' that affect ratings, the S.E.C. should avoid rules that would define what types of errors were significant enough to require disclosure. 
The letter was in response to proposed S.E.C. regulations that would tighten oversight of major ratings firms like S.& P., Moody's and Fitch Ratings. The proposals are part of the Dodd-Frank Act, the overhaul of securities law passed last year by Congress, which resulted from the 2008 financial crisis.
By coincidence, the period for comments on the proposed S.E.C. rule expired on Monday. Three days earlier, S.& P. downgraded its long-term rating on United States Treasury bonds, to AA+ from AAA, but only after the Treasury Department challenged the assumptions that went into the S.& P. decision.
The Treasury Department said its analysis revealed ''a basic math error of significant consequence,'' while S.& P. argued that it was not an error but simply a change in assumption that did not affect its final decision to cut the rating.
Even before the downgrade, Congress was pressing regulators to finish rules governing credit ratings and the rating agencies. S.& P.'s argument that it should decide how much information it discloses could prompt lawmakers to increase their scrutiny of the agencies.
Two Congressional committees, one each in the House and the Senate, are reviewing the actions of the ratings agencies since the 2008 financial crisis. Senator Tim Johnson, Democrat of South Dakota and chairman of the Senate banking committee, began gathering information about the S.& P. downgrade decision this week, said Monday that he was ''deeply disappointed'' in what he called an ''irresponsible move'' by S.& P., one that could increase interest rates on consumer loans and raise financing costs for state and local governments.
The oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House financial services committee also has been examining the performance of ratings agencies since the financial crisis. At a hearing late last month, Republican members raised questions about whether Treasury officials tried to intervene to discourage S.& P. from putting United States debt securities under review for a downgrade. That investigation is continuing, Republican committee staff members said this week.
At the July 27 hearing, some committee members said they felt regulators were moving too slowly to put into effect parts of the Dodd-Frank Act that would lessen the reliance of investors on credit ratings. Specifically, regulators at the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the S.E.C., among others, are being asked by lawmakers to delete references to specific credit ratings in securities regulations
The proposed S.E.C. rules would require ratings agencies to submit regular self-assessments of their internal controls to regulators.
Among the issues on which the S.E.C. asked for comment was whether the ratings agencies should be required to notify the public of ''significant errors'' that they find in their methodologies, and whether the S.E.C. should define what exactly constitutes a ''significant error.''
Mr. Sharma, the S.& P. president, said in his response to the S.E.C. that the company agreed that ratings agencies should be required to disclose ''significant errors'' in their methodologies. But, he added, the S.E.C. should not impose an ''arbitrary definition'' of what constitutes a significant error, but rather leave it to the agency to decide what is significant and what is minor.
''Because credit ratings reflect the subjective opinions of a committee of ratings analysts and often incorporate both quantitative and qualitative factors, we believe it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the commission to establish a principled definition for what might have constituted a 'significant error,' '' Mr. Sharma wrote.
He added, ''We have found that our error correction policy has proven to be effective and, where errors have occurred, our practice of reacting swiftly and transparently has benefited the market.''
The Treasury Department might beg to differ. After it discovered the flaw in the deficit projections used by S.& P. to justify its downgrade, the Treasury argued against the downgrade.
Catherine J. Mathis, a Standard & Poor's spokeswoman, said on Tuesday that while the firm did change its assumptions regarding the pace of discretionary spending growth based on its discussions with Treasury on Friday, its rating change ''was not affected by the change of assumptions.''

HEADLINE: Sewage Frequently Fouls Hudson River, Report Says

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Sewage routinely contaminates the Hudson River, according to a report released on Tuesday after four years of water testing in which one-fifth of the water samples indicated that the river was unsuitable for swimming and other recreation.
The study, issued by the environmental group Riverkeeper, underscores how a big sewage discharge in July, caused by a fire at a treatment plant in Manhattan, was part of a persistent and far more widespread sewage problem along the 155-mile river.
Despite improvements in water quality since the passage of the Clean Water Act in the 1970s, the group said, 21 percent of its water samples had unacceptable levels of bacteria because of problems like discharges from aging or failing sewage treatment plants, overflows caused by rain and poor maintenance of septic systems. 
''More and more people are fishing, swimming and boating in the Hudson,'' Riverkeeper's president, Paul Gallay, said in an interview. ''If we fail to take care of the river, we lose the gains we've made and the economic benefits that go with them.''
The study, based on more than 2,000 water samples collected from May through October at 75 sites between Albany and New York City from 2006 to 2010, offers some surprises. Some of the worst contamination, it turns out, comes from tributaries like streams and creeks that flow into the Hudson.
The report says further research is needed to pinpoint the cause of the pollution in the tributaries, but it suggests some possibilities like leaking septic systems that contaminate groundwater, illegal sewage hookups and agricultural runoff.
With more than eight million residents, New York City nonetheless has better water quality in its part of the Hudson than the Albany region, home to barely one million people, the study also concludes. One reason is that sewage in Albany enters a narrower and shallower stretch of the river, without the dilution benefits of New York City's proximity to the Atlantic Ocean.
Another reason, the report says, is that Albany's treatment plants do not disinfect sewage -- although there is a plan to start doing so by 2013 -- leaving that section of the Hudson ''chronically sewage-laden.''
The bright picture in New York City dims during rainstorms, however, when treatment plants cannot handle the volume, and a mix of sewage and storm water flows into the river. Over all, unacceptable samples increase more than threefold -- to 32 percent from 9 percent -- in wet weather versus dry weather, the report said.
Riverkeeper's testing program, a collaboration with Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia University and Queens College at the City University of New York, measures levels of the bacterium enterococcus, which lives in the intestines of humans and some animals. The group said that only New York City and 4 of 10 counties along the river currently perform water quality tests and that none report the findings in a timely fashion.
Riverkeeper officials are recommending weekly water quality testing and public notification on results, more spending on wastewater infrastructure, better enforcement of clean-water laws and new rules like one requiring the inspection and maintenance of private septic systems.
Carter Strickland, a deputy commissioner with the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, said on Tuesday that the city had spent nearly $2 billion since the 1990s addressing the problem of combined sewer overflows, which involve systems that collect both storm water runoff and sanitary sewage in the same pipe. He said the solutions included separating the sewage and storm water runoff in some areas and building storage tanks in others so that overflows can be retained and treated.
The Bloomberg administration is also encouraging investment in environmentally friendly infrastructure, like roofs with plantings and porous pavement for parking lots, to capture and retain storm water before it reaches the sewer system and overloads it, Mr. Strickland said.
In the meantime, he said, his department is working toward releasing the results of its water quality tests to the public as soon as they become available.

HEADLINE: London Rioting Prompts Fears Over Soccer Matches and Olympics

BYLINE: By JULIET MACUR and ERIC PFANNER; Eric Pfanner reported from Paris.

 BODY:
Fearing for the safety of players and fans amid the rioting in London, soccer officials on Tuesday canceled two international matches and may postpone the opening weekend of the English Premier League, prompting questions about the city's ability to secure high-profile events like soccer matches and next summer's Olympics.
Those decisions were caused by the widespread violence in the city, with rioters setting cars and buildings afire, looting stores and challenging an already stretched police force. The unrest has spread into neighborhoods near the Olympic Park in east London, the site of the Olympic Stadium and several other sites that will form the heart of the 2012 London Games. 
The timing could not have been worse. This week, executives from the International Olympic Committee and officials from nearly 200 national Olympic committees arrived in London for meetings about the Summer Games. At the same time, several test events, including beach volleyball, badminton and cycling, are being held.
''There's no doubt that this is a very bad day, a worrying day, for Olympic organizers in London,'' said Tony Travers, a professor at the London School of Economics who has studied the impact of the Olympics on the city. ''They planned to protect London from conventional terrorism. But of all the things they might have thought might happen, I'd be surprised if civil insurrections was high up on their list of expected risk factors.''
Mark Adams, a spokesman for the I.O.C., said the committee was not worried about the security of next summer's Olympics because it had confidence in the Games' organizers. Officials from the United States Olympic Committee seemed equally unconcerned that this week's riots would negatively affect the Games.
Patrick Sandusky, a spokesman for the U.S.O.C., said the organization would work with Games organizers, the local police and the State Department to ensure the safety of the United States team.
He said the U.S.O.C. sent a team of three representatives, including Alan Ashley, chief of sport performance, to London this week and said those officials were in meetings at a hotel in central London miles away from the riots. Sandusky would not make any of them available for an interview.
The meetings with national Olympic committee officials were scheduled to focus on logistical matters like transportation, housing and health services, but the topic that could not be avoided was the riots that were shown continuously on some news channels.
As some 16,000 police officers tried to control the unrest, Games organizers tried to reassure their Olympic guests that the chaos was an aberration.
''We have a commitment to deliver a safe and secure Games and we will do so,'' Olympics Minister Hugh Robertson said, according to The Associated Press. ''All the evidence shows this trouble is low-level criminality driven by messages on social networks and not some new, emerging security threat.''
Still, Paula Radcliffe, a British marathoner, said on Twitter that she had concerns: ''In less than one year we welcome the world to London, and right now the world doesn't want to come.''
Yet even if fans wanted to watch top soccer games in London this week, soccer officials took that opportunity away from them -- and may continue to do so.
The Football Association, the governing body of soccer in England, canceled a friendly between England and the Netherlands set for Wednesday at Wembley Stadium, saying that the security at the stadium would be weakened because the police would be dispatched to the riots. An exhibition game between Nigeria and Ghana, scheduled for Tuesday in Watford, near London, was also scratched, as were four matches Tuesday involving second-tier London clubs in the Carling Cup.
''While it's an important game of football -- for us, every game is important -- the most important thing in reality here is the safety and security of all of the supporters and all of the teams,'' Adrian Bevington, the managing director of Club England at the Football Association, told the BBC.
The Premier League, the top English professional soccer league, said it would announce by Thursday whether its three games set for London on Saturday would go ahead as planned. The police would have the final say, a league spokesman, Nick Noble, said.
One of those games involves Tottenham Hotspur, a team based in a neighborhood where the riots began last weekend after the police shot and killed a local resident. A ticket office at the Tottenham stadium was vandalized over the weekend.
But the Olympic test events scheduled for London this week are expected to go off as planned. The world badminton championships are being held in north London. A marathon swim will be held in Hyde Park on Saturday. A cycling race will be held Sunday.
And on Tuesday, a beach volleyball tournament began at Horse Guards Parade, nearly in earshot of the prime minister's traditional residence at 10 Downing Street. At the last minute, the event was pushed up by three hours so it could end by nightfall.
While Prime Minister David Cameron met with his security advisers, players dived, spiked and leapt on 2,000-plus tons of sand that had been trucked in.
The top American beach volleyball players April Ross and Jen Kessy competed in the event, later saying in a telephone interview that they felt safe at the site because of the increased security. Ross said there were X-ray machines and full-body scanners at the entrance to the site, as well as a visible police presence.
''If we didn't see the riots on the news, we wouldn't have any idea that they were going on,'' she said, adding that she and Kessy had been glued to the television since arriving Sunday.
''We keep asking everyone: 'How far away are the riots? Are we safe?' '' she said. ''But the people at the hotel always tell us that they are miles and miles away. So we are lucky because a lot of venues are probably a lot closer.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Surge as a Fed Statement Sinks In: Interest Rates To Stay Low, Cheering Market

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Floyd Norris, Julie Creswell and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In another wild day on Wall Street, stocks climbed, then dropped, then rocketed as traders did a double take on the Federal Reserve's much-awaited statement on the economy Tuesday afternoon.
The Fed announced that while it would not be coming to the rescue with some new program to stimulate the economy, it would leave interest rates unchanged for a couple of years.
That sent stocks tumbling -- until traders figured out that locked-in interest rates and cheap credit could actually give the economy a more solid footing. Minutes after the 2:15 p.m. announcement, the Dow Jones industrial average sped downward 1.7 percent. But stocks soon made a U-turn and roared through the rest of trading. For the day, the Dow rose 429 points, or 3.98 percent, to close at 11,239.77. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.7 percent to 1,172.53.
It was the biggest daily gain in both indexes since March 2009, and followed the carnage of Monday's 6.7 percent S.& P. sell-off, the biggest loss since the height of the financial crisis in late 2008. 
Following the initial disappointment in the Fed's statement, the move seemed significant: after already cutting the short-term federal funds rate to virtually zero, the Fed was effectively telling investors it was now going to keep two-year bond rates close to zero as well.
As that interpretation spread through markets, investors realized it could provide a big stimulus to the economy and, with bond yields tumbling quickly as a result, encourage investors to hold stocks.
''It was quite a violent reaction,'' said Ron Florance, the managing director for investment strategy at Wells Fargo Private Bank.
But it is uncertain whether the euphoria of the late trading on Tuesday will continue, or whether stocks will resume their steep decline of the past couple of weeks. ''It's always spurious to try to explain a single day's move,'' said Rob Sluymer, a technical analyst at RBC Capital Markets in New York.
Few believed that after the crazy sell-offs in recent sessions and the string of downbeat economic data, the Fed's action on Tuesday meant the long-term problems of the economy were over.
''The big one out there is, there is still this concern that we could have this double-dip recession,'' said Augustine Faucher, director of macroeconomics at Moody's Analytics.
Still, many analysts pinned the rally to the fact that the Fed confirmed that near-zero rates are here to stay for another two years at least.
That had an immediate impact on the United States bond market. Two-year yields on Treasuries swung lower to a paltry 0.19 percent. They had been over 0.4 percent just a few days ago.
And yields on 10-year Treasuries, already falling in recent days on investors' search for safety amid the global market turmoil, fell further, to 2.28 percent from 2.32 percent.
Those declines, analysts said, left investors with a stark question: Where else could you put your money to earn a decent return?
''For all their volatility as we have seen, there is now no other place except stocks,'' said Todd Colvin, an interest rate strategist at MF Global.
Strange as it seems, wild swings like this -- down sharply one day, up nearly as much the next day -- are not all that unusual in times of economic uncertainty. Indeed, after the financial meltdown began in September 2008, there were 27 days by the end of the year when stocks rose or fell by 4 percent or more.
While 15 of those were down days, what most people forget is that 12 of those were up days.
Cumulatively, of course, the declines on the down days exceeded the gains on the up days, and stocks over all dropped 28 percent by the end of 2008.
On Tuesday, trading began on an optimistic note as the market rose ahead of the Fed's meeting. But around 2:15 p.m., the phones went quiet on Wall Street trading floors as traders awaited the Fed's decision.
Then, after an initial sharp drop, stocks rallied.
''The information we got from the Fed is that this is going to be a long-term fix to the economy,'' said Jonathan Corpina, a trader for Meridian Equity Partners on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.
Trading volume on United States stock exchanges surged to 16.9 billion stocks traded -- compared with an average daily volume for the year through the end of July of 7.48 billion, according to BATS Trading.
According to Bloomberg, investor activity has soared by 50 percent across global markets since late last week.
The number of ''ticks'' -- a measure of the various offers to buy and sell securities along with those that are actually traded -- soared to 41 billion across all global equity, fixed-income and options markets last Friday. That beat the previous record of 30 billion reached after the Japanese tsunami this spring or the 27.5 billion reached in May 2010 during the ''flash crash,'' said Vipul Nagrath, global head of research and development for Bloomberg.
The Fed announcement initially struck many traders as disappointing, since there was no commitment to monetary easing, and the stock market gave up its gains of earlier in the day. But within minutes, a different interpretation began to spread.
By promising that short-term rates would stay extremely low for nearly two years, the Fed was effectively saying that the value of two-year Treasury notes will not fall in that time period. That essentially shoved down interest rates on those two-year notes to under two-tenths of a percentage point, steering investors to assets that could generate more income -- like, perhaps, stocks.
In normal times, the Fed sets a target for the federal funds rate, and lowers it if it needs to ease credit. With short-term rates virtually at zero, that weapon was gone from its arsenal. Now it is taking aim at the two-year rate, where yields, already very low, did have room to fall.
Mr. Florance said the Fed announcement was basically telling investors they have ''access to free money until 2013.''
''That gives investors a time horizon, and that gives you certainty,'' be said.
The gains in the United States came after stocks in Asia closed mostly lower for the day, and European stocks fell sharply before gaining ground before the close.
The Euro Stoxx 50 index, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, closed up 0.3 percent, while the FTSE 100 index in London ended the trading day up 1.9 percent -- influenced by the better mood in the United States.
In trading on Wednesday, markets in Asia-Pacific followed Wall Street's lead. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 was 1.15 percent higher around midday, and in South Korea, the Kospi climbed nearly 2 percent. The S.& P./ASX 200 index in Australia rose 2.5 percent.
On Tuesday, the dollar declined against other major currencies. The euro rose to $1.4235 from $1.4179 late Monday in New York, while the British pound fell to $1.6202 from $1.6318. The dollar fell to 77.12 yen from 77.76 yen and to 0.7288 Swiss francs from 0.7550 francs.

HEADLINE: Scrutiny at the Border, Even for Immigrants In the Southbound Lane

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

 BODY:
NOGALES, Ariz. -- An American immigration agent bounded up the steps of a bus about to cross the United States-Mexico border recently and demanded to see the papers of all those aboard. ''Papers!'' he shouted, eyeing passengers warily as he walked up and down the aisle.
Such checks are not surprising given all the attention focused on illegal immigration these days. But this bus full of migrants was leaving the United States, not entering it. 
A raft of immigration laws in Arizona and other states is designed to make life so difficult for illegal immigrants that they pack their bags and head home. But the reality on the border is that departing the country has become more complicated than ever -- leading some people to worry that the outbound checks could not only dissuade illegal immigrants from leaving the country but also place them in a kind of no-win limbo, reviled if they stay and potentially arrested if they try to leave.
It used to be that entering Mexico, whether it was from San Diego or El Paso or here in Nogales, was a cakewalk, with no scrutiny on the United States side of the border and next to none on the Mexico side. But efforts by the Obama administration to reduce the flow of guns and drug money heading from the United States to Mexico have changed that in recent years.
Agents now regularly hop aboard southbound buses, a common way for migrants to return to their towns and villages. At permanent checkpoints set up at border crossings, they also stop southbound vehicles and confront pedestrians going south on foot.
In questioning people leaving the country about illegal contraband, agents frequently find migrants who are not engaged in smuggling but do not have permission to be in the United States. Some with clean records are let go. Others are fingerprinted and photographed for illegal entry and only then allowed to go on their way. Once they are in the government's database, they face more stringent penalties if they are caught in the United States again.
Immigrants who are found to have criminal records face more aggressive treatment. They are likely to be arrested and then formally deported.
The intent, officials say, is not to discourage illegal immigrants from leaving. Rather, it is to stem the flow of contraband. In a recent weekly report from Arizona, Customs and Border Protection said it had seized $22,102 in cash being smuggled out of the state from July 18 to July 24. During the same period, six weapons and 5,943 rounds of ammunition were recovered. Agents detained 1,606 illegal immigrants, although that included those who were both coming and going.
In interviews, departing immigrants offered a variety of reasons for leaving Arizona. Tough laws and law enforcement sweeps made life less livable. The economic downturn made it tougher to make ends meet. Then there was also a host of personal concerns. For Analleli Rios Ramirez, 24, it was the death of her brother-in-law in Cuernavaca that prompted her and her husband to decide to live closer to relatives.
''We just decided we wanted to live in our own country,'' said Ms. Rios, who was the assistant manager of a pretzel shop in a mall near Phoenix.
Some question the sense of checking the papers of migrants who are leaving anyway. The criticism comes from those who consider illegal immigrants to be outlaws and those who sympathize with their struggle to improve their lives.
''Why do we want to spend resources apprehending people who are removing themselves anyway?'' asked Jennifer Allen of the Border Action Network, a human rights group based in Tucson that aids immigrants in southern Arizona. ''I've heard of people wanting to leave the country and wondering if they should risk it. It's in the forefront of people's minds when they're deciding to leave.''
The possibility that a government policy might be discouraging illegal immigrants from leaving has led even some groups who favor tighter immigration controls to think twice about the southbound scrutiny.
''This is about the only situation we would ever advocate that our immigration laws be waived,'' William Gheen, president of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC, said last year in a statement calling for the Obama administration to ease its southbound immigration checks. ''We want to encourage the illegals to leave America on their own, and thus we ask Obama to provide them safe passage out of America.''
Making it difficult to leave the country, Mr. Gheen said, might prompt some migrants instead to leave Arizona or other states with tough immigration laws for more hospitable parts of the United States.
Despite the second guessing, the administration said the policy made sense.
''We're not trying to discourage anyone from leaving, but we do want to send the message that there are consequences for breaking immigration laws,'' said an administration official, who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
Although thousands of migrants have been detained heading south, officials said they could not break down how many were stopped because they were in the country illegally versus those stopped for smuggling violations.
Some immigrants said they were confused by the policy.
As she prepared to cross the border recently and join her husband who had crossed months before, Ms. Rios grew anxious, knowing that she did not have her papers in order and that she might be detained. She had entered the country illegally more than a decade ago, as an 11-year-old child clutching her mother's hand. Now she was returning to a country she barely knew.
''I thought this is what Arizona wanted, for me to leave,'' she said as she packed her things in Chandler, Ariz., before heading south. ''And I have to worry about them catching me on the way out.''
It turns out that she and her overstuffed pickup truck crossed from Nogales, Ariz., into Nogales, Mexico, without a hitch.
Immigration officials say they cannot check everyone and use discretion as they survey the documents of departing migrants. Ms. Rios's mother, Teodora Martinez, had left months earlier and did not have papers when an agent hopped aboard her bus. She presented an identification card issued by the Mexican Consulate in Phoenix, which did not prove legal residency. Her husband, Cesar Valle Martinez, had shown a fake ID.
The agent raised his eyebrows as he surveyed their papers and then huddled with a colleague who had also entered the bus. The couple was traveling with several young children, though, and they had American passports. ''Go on,'' the agent said finally, handing back the documents, exiting the bus and letting the family return to Mexico.

HEADLINE: The Revenge of the Rating Agencies

BYLINE: By JEFFREY MANNS. 
Jeffrey Manns is an associate professor of law at George Washington University.

 BODY:
Washington
THE credit rating agencies are taking advantage of the country's financial problems to increase their own political power. They want to ensure that regulators do not reduce their autonomy and influence.
Their strategy is brilliant. They are not piling on all at once by downgrading the United States in concert. Standard & Poor's is the bad cop for now, taking the first swipe at the United States last Friday, and seeing its influence confirmed by the stock market's dramatic reaction. Moody's and Fitch are playing the good cop -- exercising restraint about a potential downgrade, yet still flexing their muscles by criticizing the government both publicly and behind the scenes.
The rating agencies have the federal government over a barrel. If politicians ignore rating agencies' warnings, they risk a withering assault of additional downgrades that could undercut confidence in the government and inflict soaring interest rates. The good-cop, bad-cop routine is especially potent because a downgrade by two of the three major rating agencies could lead to negative consequences, such as requiring some bond issuers to secure additional collateral. 
Since the 1970s, federal statutes and regulations have mandated that debt issuers obtain ratings as evidence of creditworthiness. An oligopoly of rating agencies used this authority to effectively control access to the financial system. Even a threat of a downgrade from a rating agency could cause credit to dry up, and few inside or outside of Washington dared to challenge their dominance.
The financial crisis jeopardized the agencies' privileged position. Politicians and pundits accused them of being asleep at the wheel, if not complicit with issuers, in camouflaging risks and misleading investors during the run-up to the subprime mortgage crisis. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, enacted a year ago but not fully implemented yet, threatened to introduce unprecedented oversight and regulation.
The law called for exposing rating agencies to civil liability in securities lawsuits if their ratings were inaccurate. It also challenged the oligopoly's dominance by calling for the Securities and Exchange Commission to explore the feasibility of having an independent organization select rating agencies for asset-backed securities, instead of having the bond issuers select and pay the agencies, as they now do.
But the rating agencies struck back, first through civil disobedience. To evade potential liability, they threatened to freeze the markets for asset-backed securities by refusing to allow their ratings to be quoted in S.E.C. filings. The S.E.C. quickly caved and suspended the rule. Meanwhile, the rating agencies have begun a guerrilla campaign of behind-the-scenes lobbying to weaken the commission's efforts to carry out other parts of Dodd-Frank.
The S.& P. downgrade has elevated this simmering standoff to an overt clash. Politicians will be tempted to wave a white flag by granting the agencies a pass from tough regulation in exchange for the agencies' not downgrading federal debt further. While that approach may give the United States breathing room in the short run, the government should not give in to such extortion.
Instead, politicians must take the hard medicine of a downgrade in stride and get America's house in order, because the country faces ruin if the budget imbalances continue, regardless of what rating agencies say. At the same time, they should not forget the rating agencies' role in the crisis and allow these monitors of creditworthiness to revert to their pre-crisis ways of lax ratings and blindness to deception.

UNUSUAL SUMMER CALM
IN DISPUTED KASHMIR VALLEY
When young Muslims across North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula rose up this spring against dictatorial governments, it seemed inevitable that their example would find voice in the Kashmir Valley, a mostly Muslim region claimed by both India and Pakistan. Instead, the region is enjoying an unexpected season of tranquillity. Officials in the region say that a detente between India and Pakistan has helped cool tensions. PAGE A4

Representative Renee Ellmers, Republican of North Carolina, was elected to Congress in 2010 with zero political experience.

HEADLINE: Half-Measures From the Fed: Tools that could help the weak economy are going unused

 BODY:
It came as no surprise on Tuesday when the Federal Reserve said that the economy was in a more precarious state than it had previously believed. It was refreshing that the Fed stopped blaming ''transitory'' factors like supply-chain disruptions from Japan and acknowledged, in effect, that this year's rising joblessness and slowing growth are more than temporary setbacks. 
The Fed announced that it expected to keep short-term interest rates at near zero for another two years ''at least.'' That is a sensible move because it gives markets and businesses a dose of certainty. The stock market, which had plummeted a day earlier, surged to a strong finish. But it's doubtful that the Fed's move will be enough to increase employment and growth.
It is particularly disturbing that three members of the Fed's policy committee view inflation as a bigger threat than a weakening economy and opposed Tuesday's decision to keep rates low into 2013. Judging from earlier statements, they stand prepared to oppose further measures to boost the faltering economy.
That could make it less likely that the Fed will use other effective tools at its disposal to spur demand and hiring. The committee said it was prepared to do more ''as appropriate.'' The danger is that as long as the stock market stays relatively stable, further loosening of monetary policy will never be deemed appropriate. Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, said at the Fed meeting in June that despite high unemployment, only a heightened risk of deflation would cause further easing by the Fed.
The focus on combating inflation at a time when the economy is clearly not overheating and when oil prices are retreating is akin to Washington's fixation on spending cuts when the economy is weak. Both are a fundamental misreading of what the economy needs.
This misjudgment has led Congress and the Obama administration to pursue budget cuts without additional near-term stimulus, thus increasing the risk of prolonged stagnation or, worse, renewed recession. And it has led the Fed to deliver a grim economic outlook without doing enough to get growth back on track.
For starters, the Fed could take modest steps, like shifting its portfolio toward bonds with longer maturities, which would help to keep long-term rates low and nudge investors into riskier investments. It could reduce the interest it pays on the banks' huge reserves or even tax the reserves to try to encourage more lending. It could also resume buying Treasuries or other securities to provide additional monetary stimulus. A more aggressive strategy would be letting inflation rise above the Fed's comfort level of 2 percent or so to, say, 4 percent. That could help the economy by easing the repayment of debt.
In the absence of stimulative fiscal policy, even assertive moves by the Fed are unlikely to turn the ailing economy around. But they could help, if only the Fed would deploy them.

HEADLINE: Productivity Falls for 2nd Quarter in a Row

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The productivity of workers dropped from April through June for the second consecutive quarter, leading to an increase in labor costs that may restrain gains in profits.
The measure of employee output per hour fell at a 0.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter after a revised 0.6 percent drop in the previous three months, figures from the Labor Department showed Tuesday. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was a 0.9 percent decrease. Expenses per employee rose 2.2 percent. 
With higher labor costs, ''profitability will come under pressure,'' said Eric Green, chief market economist at TD Securities in New York, who had forecast a decline in productivity. ''This would create more caution in expanding payrolls, especially at a time when there is so much uncertainty.''
Economists' productivity forecasts in the Bloomberg survey ranged from a decrease of 2 percent to a 2.2 percent gain. Efficiency in the first quarter was previously reported as having increased 1.8 percent.
The back-to-back drop in productivity was the first since the third and fourth quarters of 2008.
Unit labor costs, which are adjusted for efficiency gains, were projected to rise 2.4 percent. Labor expenses in the first quarter were revised to 4.8 percent, the biggest gain since the fourth quarter of 2008, from a previously reported 0.7 percent advance.
From the second quarter of 2010, productivity rose 0.8 percent compared with a 1.2 percent year-over-year increase in the first quarter. Labor costs rose 1.3 percent from the year-earlier period after a 1.1 percent increase in the 12 months ended in the first quarter.
The productivity report incorporated revisions to previous years. Worker efficiency growth was revised to 4.1 percent in 2010 from a previously reported 3.9 percent. For 2009, it was revised to 2.3 percent from 3.7 percent.
Labor costs fell 2 percent in 2010, the biggest decline since records began in 1948.
A lack of productivity gains, combined with stagnant growth, may slow hiring and wages, hurting Americans' living standards. Employment grew by 117,000 in July and the jobless rate fell to 9.1 percent, the Labor Department reported last week.

HEADLINE: Charges Against Ugandan Opposition Leader Are Dropped

BYLINE: By JOSH KRON

 BODY:
A Ugandan court has dropped charges against an opposition politician, Kizza Besigye, who organized and led street protests against the government in the spring.
A magistrate, George Watyekere, said that prosecutors had failed to make a case against Mr. Besigye, who has run for president three times, and that there was not enough evidence ''to require him to defend himself,'' a local newspaper, Daily Monitor, reported on Tuesday. 
After finishing a distant second to President Yoweri Museveni in an election in February, Mr. Besigye announced that he was going to walk to his office, rather than use his car, to protest rising commodity prices and corruption. He was initially joined by only a few fellow protesters, but Mr. Museveni's government responded with overwhelming force, locking up hundreds of opposition supporters and at times using tear gas and water cannons to disperse even small numbers of protesters. At least nine people were killed during the demonstrations.
Fueled by anger over the government's repressive response, ever larger numbers of people joined the protests, and Mr. Besigye, once seen as an ineffective politician, saw his standing rise. And the government of Mr. Museveni, long viewed by the United States as a liberal ally, exhibited a draconian side.
The government called Mr. Besigye's protests inflammatory politicking, and prosecutors charged him with a number of crimes, including rioting, incitement to violence and disobeying the orders of a traffic police officer. Prosecutors dropped the charge of incitement to violence last month. Mr. Besigye said the charges were trumped up.
Before the presidential election, in which Mr. Museveni was re-elected to a fourth five-year term, Mr. Besigye had threatened Egyptian-style mass protests, and accusations of corruption and questionable government spending have polarized the political landscape.
Uganda's economy has tumbled this year, with the local currency greatly depreciating, while food and oil prices have increased. The United Nations recently warned that the country could be the next to be threatened by the famine gripping the Horn of Africa.

HEADLINE: States Pitch a Lifestyle to Lure Gun Makers From Their Longtime Homes

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
For more than a century, the nation's firearms industry, including iconic brands like Colt, Smith & Wesson and Winchester, has been concentrated in Northeastern and Midwestern states that now have restrictive gun-control laws.
But recently, states like Idaho, Alabama and Montana have presented a novel argument as part of an effort to lure the firearms industry's high-paying jobs south and west: Gun makers would be happier and more successful among citizens who regularly use firearms than they would be remaining in states trying to limit gun rights.
The approach is the latest twist in the interstate competition for scarce jobs, with hard-pressed states supplementing or even bypassing traditional enticements like tax breaks in favor of pitches that sell a lifestyle: greater personal freedom, low or no state taxes, minimal regulation, the absence of troublesome unions and of course, the unfettered right to bear arms.
''When we approach gun makers, we first make the cultural argument,'' said Gov. Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota, a hunter who recruits firearms makers at gun shows. ''People in business want to feel their business is wanted and welcome in the communities where they are located. In South Dakota, the culture is there. We don't regulate firearms businesses out of existence.'' 
Irv Stone, owner of Bar-Sto Precision Machine, which makes competition pistols, moved to Sturgis, S.D., from California last year because he said he found it increasingly difficult to operate in an environment where guns are shunned.
''The cultural thing is like night and day,'' he said. ''I felt like the bastard child in California. It is not a firearms culture. In California, it was like: 'Eww, firearms. Really?' Here, on the other hand, you are looked at kind of weird: 'Oh, you don't shoot or fish? What do you do?' ''
The nation's $3.8 billion firearms industry, which includes more than a thousand small companies as well as the famous brands, is not huge in terms of jobs. But because it employs 90,000 people amid the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, competition for those jobs has become fierce.
For the past several months, states vying for gun manufacturers have been making hay of legislation in Massachusetts, where some 10 percent of the nation's small arms makers are based, that would limit the number of guns people can buy and require ''micro-stamping'' (placing a mark on the firing pins of handguns that could allow casings to be identified). And in Illinois, home to several large firearms manufacturers, a law would ban assault rifles and would prohibit manufacturers from selling guns to state residents.
''They are pitched by places like South Dakota, Alabama and Montana, and undoubtedly part of the sales pitch is: 'We have a better environment. Our Legislature respects the Second Amendment,' '' said Lawrence G. Keane, senior vice president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the industry's trade group.
Gun manufacturers say proposed micro-stamping laws could drive Colt out of Connecticut and Remington out of New York, which are among more than half a dozen states where the legislation has been introduced. California, which employs more firearms industry workers than any other state, has already approved a micro-stamping law that is pending.
Carlton S. Chen, a vice president at Colt, said the company would have few qualms about leaving Connecticut if micro-stamping became law.
''At that point, we and other firearms manufacturers doing business in Connecticut would need to seriously consider whether we should completely move ourselves out of Connecticut and relocate to a friendlier state,'' Mr. Chen said in written testimony to a state legislative committee in 2008. ''The upshot would be a loss of thousands of jobs.''
In the South and the West, several states have recently sought to burnish their gun-friendly images by approving largely symbolic measures, like designating an official state firearm. Some states have also declared themselves exempt from federal gun policy by passing Firearms Freedom Acts, which maintain that guns made and kept within a state are not subject to the authority of Congress.
Last November, when the Olin Corporation announced that it would move an ammunition facility and 1,000 jobs to Mississippi from Illinois, it said it decided to do so because the company had failed to reach a deal with its main union and had received $25 million in incentives.
But an official in Mississippi said that what helped sway the company was most likely the state's right-to-work culture and that unlike Illinois, it has no pending legislation that would require micro-stamping.
''They understood the culture, the work force, and the surroundings,'' said Christy Knapp, an executive vice president of the Oxford-Lafayette County Economic Development Foundation in Mississippi.
Oklahoma, Montana, Wyoming and Idaho, among others, have also advanced the cultural argument.
''There's no question that the culture in states like Montana, where people are comfortable with firearms, gives a comfort level to manufacturers in other states who are assaulted with anti-gun forces,'' said Evan Barrett, chief business development officer for Montana.
But the attempted poaching of its gun makers is not being taken lightly in Massachusetts, which is home to Smith & Wesson, the nation's largest handgun manufacturer (founded in 1852) and the Savage Arms Company (1894), or in neighboring Connecticut, where Colt (1836), the Marlin Firearms Company (1870) and O. F. Mossberg & Sons (1919) are located.
In 2005, this small region produced 1.8 million firearms, according to the Western Massachusetts Economic Development Council, about one-third of all firearms made in the country.
Pushing back, Massachusetts has published a brochure promoting its firearms makers that traces the state's gun culture back to 1777, when George Washington chose Springfield as the site of the country's first arsenal.
And last year, when Massachusetts sought to ensure that Smith & Wesson stayed in Springfield, the state gave the company $6 million in tax credits to relocate one of its New Hampshire factories there. While the factory employs a modest 225 people, Massachusetts wanted to make sure the company would not start shifting operations elsewhere.
''Although several states and cities have approached us to entice expansion into their locations,'' Massachusetts had demonstrated ''the commitment of both the commonwealth and the city to not only Smith & Wesson, but to our employees, the local community, and to manufacturing in Massachusetts,'' the company said in a statement.
The quest for firearms jobs has made for some unexpected partnerships.
In New York, Senator Charles E. Schumer issued a news release in May praising Remington after it agreed to move a factory from Maine, bringing with it 40 to 50 jobs.
The release made no mention of Senator Schumer's record supporting gun control. Instead, it said Mr. Schumer had ''led the effort in Congress to repeal the law that limited competition for small arms contracts, so that Remington can now compete for small arms contracts with the Department of Defense.''
But as an indication of how surreptitious some of the interstate recruitment has been, officials in Illinois, whose firearms businesses appear to be among the most sought after by other states, say they know of no attempts to lure their gun makers away.
In recent years, Illinois has lost Les Baer Custom Inc., a small company that moved to Iowa, as well as 1,000 Winchester jobs.
Marcelyn Love, spokeswoman for the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity wrote in an e-mail, ''I am not aware of an increased effort by other states to lure specific manufacturing sectors from Illinois.''

HEADLINE: A Group Determinedly Finding a Spot Right in the Middle of Things

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

 BODY:
In 2007 Claire Chase, an accomplished flutist and an ambitious, industrious organizer, spelled out her hopes for the International Contemporary Ensemble, which she founded in 2001 with a group of fellow graduates of the Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio.
''We want to become the first large-scale, flexible contemporary ensemble in the United States that is as important and indispensable as a city's symphony orchestras, opera companies and theater companies,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 2007.
Four years and countless memorable events later, Ms. Chase and her colleagues are serving as artists in residence this year at the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center. The two concerts that the ensemble presented on Monday evening showed that insinuation into the mainstream has come without compromise: a sign of the group's integrity and evidence of the evolution afoot at Mostly Mozart over the last decade. Both events were part of Stravinsky Too, a festival subseries devoted to Stravinsky's music. 
Why Stravinsky? A fair question, and one that the concert program's notes attesting to his crabby admiration for Mozart's music only partly addressed. But in Stravinsky's chamber works, played at Alice Tully Hall in the evening, you could discern echoes of Mozart's Classical clarity and economy, as well as his ribald humor. In an imaginative stroke the concert opened with a player piano -- a Yamaha Disklavier programmed by Cory Smythe, actually -- merrily rattling its mechanized way through Stravinsky's ''Study for Pianola.''
More works followed in seamless sequence, leaping across decades. Two trumpeters in a balcony played the astringent ''Fanfare for a New Theater'' (1964); two bassoonists across the hall answered with ''Lied ohne Worte'' (1916-18), a gangly duo. ''Epitaphium,'' a funerary 12-tone miniature for trio from 1959, eased into ''Three Pieces for String Quartet,'' a modestly radical polytonal work from 1914.
Joined by the bright young conductor Pablo Heras-Casado, the ensemble made its way through increasingly larger, more complex pieces, including the puckish ''Ragtime,'' built around a cimbalom's clang, and the suave Neo-Baroque Concerto in E flat (''Dumbarton Oaks'').
The climax came in a bracing, exuberant account of the Concerto for Piano and Winds, with the pianist Peter Serkin as the dynamic soloist. Restraining the more flamboyant gestures he employed in a previous concert on Friday, Mr. Heras-Casado led with economy and precision.
''Epitaphium'' returned for a close-up in an after-hours event at the Kaplan Penthouse, held up as a model for a sequence of tributes on the occasion of Stravinsky's death in 1971, composed by Edison Denisov, Luciano Berio, Elliott Carter and Alfred Schnittke. All were impressive for their earnest economy; the Denisov and Schnittke works moved most with their evocations of fragility and tenuousness.
Michael Finnissy's ''Untitled Piece to Honour Igor Stravinsky,'' composed in 1967 and revised in 1971, rose from gauzy microtonal mystery to wiry clamor in its first American performance. John Zorn's precocious, scuttling ''Canon for Igor Stravinsky (Ode for a Crayfish),'' a pithy 1972 homage, received its world premiere in a last-minute addition to the program.
Fittingly, Stravinsky had the last word, in an exactingly performed, exuberant account of his ingenious Octet conducted by Mr. Heras-Casado.
The International Contemporary Ensemble performs again on Thursday night at Alice Tully Hall and at the Kaplan Penthouse, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center; (212) 721-6500, mostlymozart.org.

HEADLINE: Adding It All Up, Apple Is Mispriced

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and CHRISTOPHER HUGHES

 BODY:
Could Apple be worth $1 trillion? It's conceivable. The $347 billion maker of iPhones and iPads became -- if only briefly -- the most valuable company in the United States when it overtook Exxon Mobil on Tuesday. Yet Apple's sales have been surging 80 percent a year, and its profit faster. What's more, it trades roughly in line with the growing stock market -- and at less than half the price-to-earnings multiple it fetched in 2006, when revenue growth was much slower.
Apple now trades at about 11 times estimated earnings for the fiscal year ending September 2012. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is valued at about 10 times next year's profit. But Apple's sales growth is nearly 10 times faster than that of the average company. Apple also holds $76 billion of cash and investments. 
To get at this dissonance another way, consider Apple's price-to-earnings growth ratio. This hints at the price of growth by dividing a company's price-to-earnings ratio by its projected percentage earnings growth. A smaller figure suggests a company is cheaper. Apple's is 0.2. That's low compared with growth darlings. Chipotle Mexican Grill, the burrito purveyor, for instance, comes in at 2.1, and Salesforce.com at 13.2. Pandora Media and LinkedIn aren't even expected to make money soon.
Alternatively, put Apple on the same P/E multiple it traded on in 2006, and it would be worth almost $900 billion. A premium for today's faster growth could get it to $1 trillion. Apple can't be so cheap just because Steven P. Jobs, the chief executive, is in bad health.
True, Apple already sells more each quarter than it did in all of fiscal 2007, and it takes more and more success to move the needle. Growth could easily slow. Yet the smartphone and tablet markets are young, the company's customers show remarkable fidelity and areas like television are ripe for new gadgets. Moreover, Apple's return on equity is almost twice what it was in 2006, suggesting it has pricing power.
Maybe investors simply can't fathom a company so large. A $1 trillion Apple would be the equivalent of adding all of Microsoft, Google, Intel, Amazon and more to Apple's current market value. Perhaps Apple is correctly priced, the market too expensive and growth stocks grotesquely so. But something doesn't add up. In relative terms, Apple should be worth far more.
A Haven With Warts
London's international reputation has suffered another blow. Images of fire and looting across the capital, beamed around the world, raise questions about the government's ability to keep the city safe. Combined with the aftermath of the financial crisis, it's another factor that could make London less attractive for mobile workers and investors.
The British capital has a haven status that is peculiar for the factors working against it. Heathrow Airport may not be as bad as it once was, but still causes frustration for international travelers. Londoners generally must allow an hour to get from A to B within the city. Property prices are sky-high. Personal taxation has become more onerous.
Nevertheless, London remains a desirable place to live, work and invest. Superprime residential property has become a financial asset in its own right -- a relatively safe store of value for the wealthy of the Middle East, Russia and Asia.
Widespread disorder, however, could prompt calls for the government to soften its austerity program. That would be the wrong policy response. The reality is that Britain simply has little choice but to stay the course. It can't afford to put its triple-A credit rating in jeopardy. But after restoring order, one priority should be to repair the image of London globally.
No one of course need organize a charity collection for the international elite, whose prospects are the polar opposite of those of the rioters. Indeed, their visible wealth and prosperity are a provocation to the youths feeling excluded from even remotely similar opportunities. That's a challenge for longer-term social and economic policy.
But London would regret failing to recruit talented individuals. There will be those who are this week weighing job offers based in London and other financial centers. The scenes on TV may be the marginal deciding factor in the decision. Boris Johnson, London's mayor, is at last returning from vacation. He has a city to defend.

HEADLINE: Technology Investors Turn Wary On Ventures

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
REDWOOD CITY, Calif. -- Even as Wall Street trembles, the market for investing in tech start-ups remains white-hot. Still, some investors are proceeding with extreme caution.
Saying they learned their lesson in the dot-com boom and bust, and the 2008 recession, the institutional investors -- pension funds, university endowments and foundations -- that put money in venture capital funds are more selectively choosing the firms in which they invest, doing exhaustive research before handing over money, and in some cases driving hard bargains for more favorable management fees and shares of profits.
Though most say they remain bullish on venture capital, they know that as the limited partners, they would be the ones to feel the pain if a bubble bursts. After all, they put up most of the money.
And as they watch the stock market gyrate, they remember all too clearly the nightmarish consequences of having too much of their money tied up in illiquid assets like venture capital in late 2008 and 2009. They have recently slowed their investing in venture funds and could cut back more. 
''Whenever there's market tumult, people get more nervous about how illiquid and long-dated their portfolios are,'' said Chris Douvos, co-head of private equity at the Investment Fund for Foundations. ''My worry is if you have continued tumult, it's going to scare people away.''
Even before last week, the days when institutional investors threw money at venture funds because they felt lucky just to be able to invest were gone. More recently, they want more transparency from the famously tight-lipped funds, and in some cases, they are getting it. One firm has started giving limited partners files with its portfolio companies' financial information, a rarity. And limited partners say venture capitalists are increasingly available for one-on-one meetings.
''I call it the Madoff effect,'' said Jordan Silber, a partner in the venture capital group at the law firm Cooley, speaking recently at the Venture Capital Investing Conference here in Redwood City, outside of San Francisco. ''We're seeing extremely deep dives and due diligence and looking at people and their track record in a way we've just never seen before.''
Despite the fervor over companies that have gone public or are on the verge of doing so, like LinkedIn, Facebook and Groupon, and even though venture capitalists are investing more money in start-ups than they have for the last two years, institutional investment in venture capital funds is near the five-year quarterly low.
Limited partners invested $2.7 billion in 37 funds in the second quarter, half of which went to a single firm, Accel, an investor in Facebook and Groupon. Investment was down from $7.6 billion in 42 funds in the first quarter, according to the National Venture Capital Association, though it was up 28 percent from the same period last year.
Limited partners say they are wary because venture capitalists are investing in start-ups at valuations several times higher than a year ago.
''I look at some of the companies and they really don't have a business model, so I'm afraid,'' said Kelvin Liu, a director at Invesco Private Capital, at the conference, which was hosted by International Business Forum. ''To people who are willing to pay at $5 or $10 billion valuations, I say: 'Why are you doing that? Take your money out.' ''
Venture capital attracts universities in particular, which have followed the so-called Yale model by investing in alternative, illiquid assets. But universities and other institutional investors froze in late 2008. Suddenly faced with shrinking investments in public equities, many, including Duke, Columbia and Harvard, sold or considered selling their stakes in illiquid venture funds on the secondary market or sharply decreased the amount they invested in venture.
Now, just as limited partners are tiptoeing back to the asset class, talk of a another stock market crash as well as of a tech bubble is making them skittish, even as they say they remain long-term investors and are heartened by recent initial public offerings.
''We are absolutely positive, and it's been a great exit environment over the last six months,'' said Nicole Belytschko, who leads venture capital investing at C.M. Capital. ''But at the same time, while we're getting a lot of capital back from very good exits, our managers are deploying capital at very expensive valuations.''
Limited partners have long said they want to invest only in venture firms with returns in the top quartile, but there is evidence they are even pickier lately: the number of firms they chose in the second quarter, 37, is the lowest since 1995.
Firms with long, strong track records, like Sequoia Capital and Accel, and up-and-comers with big-name investments, like Union Square Ventures and Foundry Group, have more suitors than they can accept. But limited partners are trying to steer clear of firms that missed out on the latest wave of tech investing.
Some venture firms ''are desperate to get in, and a lot of them are bidding up the prices,'' said Judith Elsea, managing director of Weathergage Capital, a venture fund of funds. ''If they're just handing out checks and showing up late to the party, they become dumb money. It's hard to filter that out, but it's pretty clear that's happening.''
To try to separate the followers from the leaders, investors are painstakingly doing their homework.
Mr. Douvos said at the conference that when he worked at Princeton's endowment fund from 2001 to 2004, venture capitalists would show three-page flip books and say, ''Here's our awesome fund, it's twice as large as the last fund, send us our check.''
No longer. ''One thing we're learning now is we want more and more transparency; we want to spend time asking questions,'' he said. ''These funds last twice as long as the average American marriage, so you really need to understand your partners.'' For instance, he shows up at the doorsteps of start-ups that a venture firm has financed but that are not on the firm's reference list.
To make their case, some venture firms are showering their investors with data and attention. And at its annual meeting for limited partners this summer, Andreessen Horowitz, an investor in companies like Zynga and Groupon, addressed bubble fears head-on. The partners showed slides demonstrating that private company valuations lag the valuations of public tech companies and that venture capitalists are investing significantly less than they did during the last bubble.
Other firms are open to negotiating once-unbending terms. Venture funds typically charge management fees of 2 percent of committed capital and keep 20 percent to 30 percent of profits, known as carried interest.
But recently, said George Arnold of Knightsbridge Advisers, a venture capital fund of funds, some firms have offered to start with low carried interest and increase it only if they achieve certain results, or collect management fees only on invested capital, not committed capital. Others said venture capitalists were investing more of their own money in funds. In January, the Institutional Limited Partners Association, a trade group, introduced a revised set of guidelines for investors to use in negotiations with funds.
Still, the best firms, like those that spotted companies like Facebook and Twitter early on, have no interest in negotiating the terms -- simply because they do not have to.
''It's very difficult to have any negotiating power with a group like that,'' Ms. Belytschko said. ''That's our biggest challenge.''

HEADLINE: Heavy Trucks to Be Subject to New Rules for Mileage

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Big tractor-trailer trucks will have to get 20 percent more miles per gallon by the 2018 model year under the first-ever fuel economy rules for heavy vehicles, announced Tuesday by President Obama.
The rules mimic the ''light duty'' fuel economy standards for cars and sport utility vehicles that have been in place since 1975. But they are more complex, tailored to cover vehicles including garbage trucks, which must get a 10 percent improvement, and pickups and vans too big to be covered by the existing rules, which must now make a 15 percent improvement.
The rules are allowed under a law signed by President George W. Bush in 2007, but it has taken until now to devise the program. And Mr. Obama, at a time when there is substantial opposition to new environmental rules, said in a statement that the vehicle owners wanted their trucks to be regulated. 
''While we were working to improve the efficiency of cars and light-duty trucks, something interesting happened,'' he said in a statement. ''We started getting letters asking that we do the same for medium and heavy-duty trucks. They were from people who build, buy and drive these trucks.''
In fact, truck manufacturers have not been nearly as resistant to fuel economy standards as car manufacturers have sometimes been. Experts say that if all the manufacturers are pushed into building more efficient trucks, customers will have a reason to buy new vehicles, even if they cost more.
The Environmental Protection Agency said that the rules would cost vehicle buyers $8 billion, but that would be paid for in fuel savings in a year or two, depending on the vehicle. Total benefits, including less time spent refueling, and lower global-warming emissions, would exceed costs by $49 billion over the lifetime of the trucks, the agency said.
While the percentage gains are significant, some of the vehicles go only six miles or so on a gallon, so the actual miles per gallon numbers will not rise much. But the vehicles can cover more than 200,000 miles a year.
The agency may expand its regulations later to cover the aerodynamics of trailers.
Commercial trucks used about 22 billion gallons of diesel fuel last year, a number that experts say could be cut substantially. Heavy-duty vehicles also consumed a significant fraction of the 150 billion gallons of gasoline and ethanol sold last year.
Drew Kodjak, a vehicle expert who served on a National Academy of Sciences panel that studied how large a fuel economy improvement was reasonable, said that no matter what the precise numbers specified in the new rule, simply publishing it was important to lay the groundwork for future improvements. The rule, Mr. Kodjak said, ''establishes the key elements of the program,'' including the standard course over which the vehicles would be measured, the existing level of fuel economy and determination of who is responsible for improvements. Rules can be tightened over time, he said.
Owners of the biggest trucks could spend substantial sums on equipment to improve fuel economy and still come out ahead financially, said Allen R. Schaeffer, executive director of the Diesel Technology Forum, a trade association, because small percentage improvements would add up to big volumes of fuel. ''A typical long-haul truck, running 150,000 miles a year at 6 miles a gallon, is burning 25,000 gallons a year,'' Mr. Schaeffer said. At a price of $4 a gallon, that comes to $100,000 for fuel. ''That is a big number,'' he said.
Zoe Lipman, senior manager of transportation solutions at the National Wildlife Federation, said of tougher fuel standards, ''It's definitely about time we got to the heavy stuff.'' The new rules, Ms. Lipman said, will result in technologies already in use on light-duty vehicles being employed in bigger trucks.

HEADLINE: Withholder In Chief

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
DES MOINES
Even the Butter Cow at the Iowa State Fair is not enough to sweeten the mood.
Three years ago, Barack Obama's unlikely presidential dream was given wings by rapturous Iowans -- young, old and in-between -- who saw in the fresh-faced, silky-voiced black senator a chance to leap past the bellicose, rancorous Bush years into a modern, competitive future where we once more had luster in the world.
''We are choosing hope over fear,'' Senator Obama told a delirious crowd of 3,000 here the night he won the Iowa caucuses. 
But fear has garroted hope, as America reels from the latest humiliating blows on the economy and in Afghanistan. The politician who came across as a redeemer in 2008 is now in need of redemption himself.
Faced with a country keening for reassurance and reinvention, Obama seems at a loss. Regarding his political skills, he turns out to be the odd case of a pragmatist who can't learn from his mistakes and adapt.
Many of his Democratic supporters here, who once waited hours in line just to catch a glimpse of The One, are disillusioned.
''We just wish he'd be more of a fighter,'' said one influential Democrat with a grimace. Another agreed: ''You can't blame him for everything. I just wish he would come across more forceful at times, but that is not the dude's style. Detached hurts you when things are sour. You need some of Clinton's 'I feel your pain' compassion.''
The president has been so spectacularly unable to fill the leadership void in Washington that the high-spirited Michele Bachmann feels free to purloin Obama's old mantra.
''The power behind our campaign is hope and a future,'' she chirped to a sparse crowd Monday in Atlantic, Iowa. ''That's all I believe in.'' That and making America safe for old-fashioned light bulbs and not those weird curly ones.
Obama's response on Monday to Friday's Standard & Poor's downgrade and to the 22 Navy Seal commandos and 8 other soldiers killed by a Taliban rocket-propelled grenade in Afghanistan was once more too little, too late. It was just like his belated, ineffectual response on the BP oil spill and his reaction to the would-be Christmas Day bomber; it took him three days on vacation in Hawaii to speak about the terrorist incident when the country was scared about national security, and then he spent the next week callously shuttling from the podium to the golf course.
Bachmann has been riding around Iowa in her bus, with Elvis music and her name emblazoned 25 times on the outside, mocking Obama for going to Camp David last weekend and burrowing in, while the country was roiling.
His inability to grab a microphone and spontaneously assuage Americans' fears is strange. If the American servicemen had died on a Monday, he wouldn't have waited until Wednesday to talk about it. He doesn't like the bully pulpit, just the professor's lectern.
After failing to interrupt his Camp David weekend to buck up the country on one of its worst days in history, he tacked on his condolences for the soldiers' families to his economic pep talk, in what had to be the most inept oratorical segue of his presidency.
He long ago should have gone out into the country to talk to Americans in person and come up with a concrete plan that people could print out from the White House Web site and study. Hasn't he learned how dangerous it is to delegate to Congress? His withholding and reactive nature has made him seem strangely irrelevant in Washington, trapped by his own temperament. He doesn't lead, and he doesn't understand why we don't feel led.
Speaking from the State Dining Room of the White House, he advised America it was still ''a triple-A country'' like some cerebral soccer coach urging the kids to win one for the London Interbank Offered Rate.
With traders hearing nothing new, just boilerplate about ''common sense and compromise'' on deficit reduction, the Dow Jones industrial average, which had already fallen 410 points, fell 20 more points while the president was talking around 2 o'clock. By the 4 p.m. close, the Dow was 634 points lower.
Obama has spent a lifetime creating his persona -- superior, wise, above all parties and interests, all-seeing, calm, unflappable.
But as Drew Westen, a liberal psychology professor at Emory University wrote in The Times on Sunday, puzzling about what has happened to his former hero's passion, the president never identifies the villains who cause our epic problems.
It's unclear, Westen wrote, whether that reflects his aversion to conflict or a fear of offending donors, or both.
Obama's assumption that you can rise above ascribing villainous motives has caused him to waste huge chunks of his first term seeking bipartisanship from Republicans who were playing him for a dupe. And it has led to Americans regarding the nation's capital as a place of all villains and no heroes.

HEADLINE: Syrian Leader Rejects Turkey's Plea To End Violent Crackdown in Cities

BYLINE: By NADA BAKRI; Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, and Sebnem Arsu from Istanbul.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- President Bashar al-Assad of Syria rebuffed an appeal from Turkey on Tuesday to end the Syrian crackdown that has emerged as one of the bloodiest chapters in the Arab uprising and has plunged his country into its deepest isolation in years.
Mr. Assad said in a statement after a six-hour meeting with Turkey's foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, that his government would press ahead with its fight against militant Islamists, the term the government has often used to describe the instigators of an uprising that began in March and has posed the gravest challenge to Mr. Assad's rule. 
Sana, Syria's state news agency, quoted Mr. Assad as telling Mr. Davutoglu that Damascus ''will not relent in pursuing the terrorist groups in order to protect the stability of the country and the security of the citizens.''
''But it is also determined to continue reforms. And is open to any help offered by friendly and brotherly states,'' the statement published by Sana said.
The Turkish foreign minister arrived in Syria on Tuesday morning to deliver a message that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has summarized as Ankara's having ''run out of patience'' with a crackdown that has killed, by the count of some Syrian opposition groups, more than 2,000 people.
Turkey, Syria's neighbor to the north, was an emerging ally before relations stumbled over Mr. Assad's crackdown, and its officials are still thought to retain leverage with Mr. Assad, who took power in 2000. By his own count, Mr. Davutoglu has visited Syria more than 60 times over the past eight years.
''Mr. Assad conveyed his own thoughts, and we shared our views for the bloodshed to stop as soon as possible and people of Syria from all sects to live in peace in the future,'' Mr. Davutoglu told reporters in Ankara after his meeting with Mr. Assad.
Washington signaled its support for the Turkish envoy's visit, and a spokesman for the State Department in Washington said that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton had spoken with Mr. Davutoglu before his meeting in Damascus. The spokesman, Mark Toner, called it an opportunity ''to send yet another strong message to Assad.''
But Mr. Davutoglu insisted that he was not speaking on behalf of the United States. ''We conveyed only Turkey's messages and none other,'' he said.
The United States and Turkey remain allies, but under Mr. Erdogan the country has undertaken a more assertive and independent foreign policy in the Middle East, where its influence has grown markedly over the past decade.
A Turkish official who asked not to be named said the United States was seeking further sanctions on Syria, a position that Turkey opposes. ''There is a discrepancy in the way Turkish and American officials handle the conflict,'' the official said, while adding that both wanted an end to civilian deaths.
Turkish officials long viewed better ties with Syria as one of their greatest foreign policy successes. The two have held joint cabinet meetings and military exercises. Visa requirements were lifted in 2009, border gates were expanded and a new crossing was built, helping to triple trade in three years. The uprising, though, has shaken Turkey's ambitions to integrate with the region's economies, as Syria grows more isolated.
As the two officials met in Damascus, the country's military and security forces pressed ahead with attacks on several cities, and activists said that at least 23 people were killed across the country. Tanks also assaulted the town of Binnish, in the northwestern province of Idlib, near the border with Turkey.
Mr. Davutoglu's visit comes amid a flurry of diplomatic efforts on Syria. On Wednesday, representatives from India, Brazil and South Africa were scheduled to meet Syria's foreign minister, Walid Muallem, to urge him to end the crackdown.
This week, in what appeared to be a coordinated campaign, Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf countries withdrew their ambassadors. On Tuesday, Egypt added its voice to the condemnations. Its foreign minister, Mohamed Amr, said that Syria was heading toward what he described as ''the point of no return.''
''Egypt is following with extreme concern the dangerous deterioration of the situation in Syria,'' Egypt's state news agency, Mena, quoted him as saying.
Activists said that Deir al-Zour, a besieged city in northeastern Syria, was shelled for more than 10 hours on Tuesday and that three people had died there. One resident, who gave his name as Maamoun, said that armed men loyal to the government, known as shabiha, were burning houses and shops that belong to activists and protesters on the authorities' lists of wanted people.
''We lived under this regime for 40 years, so we're ready to wait for another year to see it fall,'' said Maamoun, reached by phone. ''It is only a matter of time before it falls.''
Deir al-Zour may prove a serious challenge to Mr. Assad's government. Populated by extended clans that are well armed and protective of their independence, the city was long thought too dangerous for the government to attack.
The Local Coordination Committees, a rights group that has been documenting the Syrian uprising, said five people were also killed in Taybit al-Imam, a town near the besieged city of Hama, in central Syria. Security forces withdrew from Hama in June, but a little more than a week ago the military launched a fierce assault in an effort to retake control.
The attack came on the eve of the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, in which the observant fast from dawn to dusk. Activists said that more than 300 Syrians had been killed so far during Ramadan, 200 of them in Hama and the rest in Deir al-Zour and other regions.

HEADLINE: No 2013 plans, but Actor Seems Focused on Mayor's Office

BYLINE: By SARAH MASLIN NIR

 BODY:
Alec Baldwin is not running for mayor of New York -- yet.
First, Mr. Baldwin, a 53-year-old actor and Long Island native, wants to finish his work on his television show, ''30 Rock,'' then go back to school and learn what the job is all about.
In an interview on Monday, Mr. Baldwin spoke extensively about his long-term political ambitions, his views on political figures, his anger about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's overturning of the city's term-limits law and how he stays in touch with regular people despite his wealth and fame. 
He said it had helped him to live on the Upper West Side, rather than in a wealthier neighborhood. ''It is more real,'' he said. ''There's old people, it's ethnic and it's economically mixed. It's not a little kind of jewel-box, privileged pocket of the city like some neighborhoods are.''
He added, ''I am more comfortable living where it seems more middle class, and I have lived there deliberately.''
Speculation about Mr. Baldwin's political future picked up after a sex scandal upended former Representative Anthony D. Weiner's career in June, forcing him to resign from Congress and dashing his mayoral ambitions.
Mr. Baldwin said that he would probably sit out in 2013 but run in a later election, and that he wanted to educate himself about the mayor's office first. He is talking with two top universities about enrolling in a master's program in politics and government ''to help me better understand what the fiscal imperatives of that job are,'' he said. ''What's the reality of the city unions, of contracts, agreements, teachers, infrastructure, decentralizing, everything? And utilities, Con Ed, the M.T.A. -- how does it all work?''
Running in 2013 would be nearly impossible, he said, because he is obligated to complete the current season of ''30 Rock,'' which wraps up in April, and to appear occasionally in future episodes. And he plans to enroll in school in the fall of 2012.
His legal residence is in Amagansett, on Long Island, but he plans to establish a permanent residence in the city before running for office. He has owned his home on the Upper West Side for more than two decades but is reluctantly leaving the neighborhood for a downtown location to be closer to his girlfriend, Hilaria Thomas, 27, who works at a yoga studio.
The actor is still unhappy about Mr. Bloomberg's rewriting the term-limits law in 2008, which allowed the mayor to serve another four years.
''All the Bloomberg supporters look at me and say, 'What do you got against Bloomberg?' '' he said. ''Well, I don't have anything against Bloomberg, but there are term limits. The whole point is, whether you liked him or didn't like him, he's got to go.''
Mr. Baldwin suggested that the term-limit issue would hurt the electoral prospects of the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, who went along with the mayor's move.
''I think it absolutely, positively disqualifies her,'' he said. ''She totally betrayed a huge constituency here in the city.''
Ms. Quinn's office did not respond to requests for a comment on Tuesday.
In the case of Mr. Weiner, Mr. Baldwin said he had supported the congressman for a time, even amid revelations of Mr. Weiner's sexually explicit online communications, because ''sexual scandal, to me, is meaningless.'' But he concluded that Mr. Weiner, a fellow Democrat, could not survive politically after it was revealed that his wife, Huma Abedin, was pregnant.
Mr. Baldwin seemed focused on the mayor's office but allowed the possibility that he would consider other positions. He is clearly aiming high, however, dismissing the idea of serving as a local judge or in the House of Representatives.
Mr. Baldwin said that high-profile fund-raisers had asked him numerous times to run for office in other states, like for Senate in Connecticut or for governor in California, but that he did not want move from New York.
As a native of Massapequa and one of six children, he said he felt he had the ability to connect with New Yorkers of all backgrounds, despite his success.
''There are people who make a lot of money who become rich people, and then there are people who make a lot of money, but they don't think like rich people do,'' he said. ''No matter how much money they have, they are the same from their own upbringing. I would definitely put myself in the latter class.''
He added, ''What I think the government should be doing, who I think government should be serving, and in what way and what it should be prioritizing is a lot different than people would think.''
As for Mr. Baldwin's own scandals -- including his acrimonious divorce from the actress Kim Basinger and leaked answering-machine tapes in which he was heard calling his daughter, Ireland, then 11, a ''pig'' -- he said he believed the public would see past his missteps.
''What I do for a living has provided people with an almost bottomless container of video clips of me doing the most asinine things,'' he said. But he remained confident that he would be able to weather criticism of his past behavior, ''including the tape of me with my daughter.''
Despite the urging of friends and fans that he run for mayor in 2013, he said he wanted to wait for the right opportunity. And, he said, he realized he would be taking a risk by entering politics.
''I am someone who is fully prepared for the fact that I could go into this and do it and completely have my ass kicked,'' he said. ''I could throw a party and no one could come. And it would be this staggering lesson for me.''

HEADLINE: G.M. Sees Cost Cuts Continuing for Years In Effort to Sustain Long-Term Growth

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DETROIT -- General Motors, already much leaner and more efficient after going through bankruptcy and a painful reorganization, still has to undertake years of sharp cost cuts to ensure it remains profitable, its executives said Tuesday. 
G.M. executives said that they intended to cut the number of different platforms and engines used in the company's vehicle lineup roughly in half within the next decade.
By 2018, G.M. will use 14 different platforms globally, down from 30 last year. A platform is the basic underpinnings of a vehicle, and building multiple vehicles on a single platform reduces development and production costs.
The executives also said G.M. was working to eliminate wasted spending on new products by keeping its investments more stable from one year to the next, rather than trying to follow the ups and downs of the market
''The start-stop, herky-jerky, on-again, off-again product development was grossly inefficient,'' the chief executive, Daniel F. Akerson, said, ''and it resulted in poor product.''
The plans, outlined at an analyst conference that G.M. organized at its Detroit headquarters, call for using 12 engine families by 2018 and eventually just 10, compared to 20 in 2009.
Daniel Ammann, the chief financial officer, said G.M. had been putting about $1 billion a year into projects that were later canceled.
Last week, G.M., which is 26 percent government-owned, reported that it earned $5.4 billion in the first half of the year as second-quarter earnings grew 89 percent. Its profit margins have increased as a result of higher revenue as well as wrenching cost cuts that included closing many plants and eliminating tens of thousands of jobs.
On Tuesday, the company said that its annual manufacturing labor costs in the United States had fallen by $11 billion since 2005. The executives added that they were working to keep labor costs under control, even as demand for G.M. vehicles increased.
Diana Tremblay, G.M.'s global chief manufacturing officer, said the company did not need to add plants anytime soon, even though its capacity utilization rate -- a measure of how fully and efficiently plants are used -- was near 100 percent. G.M. is particularly hesitant to add production capacity in the United States during a time of such volatile economic and market conditions. Ms. Tremblay said that G.M. could meet demand largely by adding shifts, running plants on overtime and finding creative ways to run existing plants more efficiently.
Leaders of the United Automobile Workers union, which is negotiating a new contract with G.M., could have a difficult time persuading the automaker to reopen idled plants in Tennessee and Wisconsin. They are also trying to prevent the planned closing of a plant in Louisiana, a top priority during the talks.
Mr. Akerson expressed some doubt about whether total industry sales across the country would reach 13 million vehicles this year. G.M. and other automakers had generally projected sales between 13 million and 13.5 million, up from 11.6 million in 2010; from January through July, the industry sold 7.4 million vehicles.
''There's a lot of turmoil in the business and turmoil means uncertainty,'' Mr. Akerson said, ''so we're a little unsure of these numbers.''

HEADLINE: Lessons From the Financial Turmoil

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''While the Markets Swoon ...,'' by Joe Nocera (column, Aug. 9):
It turns out that we didn't actually have to default on our obligations to throw the world economy into apoplectic turmoil. We have accomplished the wondrous feat of paying our bills and still creating a crisis of confidence.
We can ill afford to repeat the charade of the last several months. I hope that what we are witnessing is but a momentary response and that world markets will soon find their equilibrium. 
But if there is a lesson to be learned, it is that the reckless abandon with which the Republican Party threatens our country's well-being must stop. Its efforts to damage the opposition have instead taken down the very value of this country. For all that Standard & Poor's has miscalculated in the past, it is correct in its assertion that we are a nation that no longer instills trust. And that is a loss far greater than any stock market decline.
It is past time for the Republicans to stop being the bully and to start being a productive partner.
ROBERT S. NUSSBAUM Fort Lee, N.J., Aug. 9, 2011
To the Editor:
Re ''As Obama Counsels Calm, the Finger-Pointing Continues'' (news analysis, Business Day, Aug. 9):
What a namby-pamby response from President Obama to the downgrade of America's credit rating. He should have said that S.&P. really blundered by giving top ratings to toxic mortgage-backed bonds, that it blundered during the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s and that it has blundered again by downgrading the United States' credit rating.
It should have been the president, not the Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, who charged that S.&P. exercised ''terrible judgment.''
It's time to lead, Mr. President, not tread water.
RICHARD VALERIANI Sherman, Conn., Aug. 9, 2011
The writer is a former correspondent for NBC News.
To the Editor:
After the debt downgrade, the financial markets swooned (front page, Aug. 9), and there is serious talk about a double-dip recession. President Obama spoke with lukewarm enthusiasm about parties working together after their August recess. What I expected was that the president and Congress would face up to the potential for more serious economic disruptions by returning during this current recess and trying to put some plans into action for jobs, jobs and more jobs.
Perhaps the outrage shown by voters in Wisconsin -- where state senators are facing recall votes -- will awaken our lawmakers in Congress to the seriousness of a myopic opposition party's role in the current economic turbulence.
SAM ELLENPORT Belmont, Mass., Aug. 9, 2011
To the Editor:
The dramatic drop in the stock market on Monday dominated the news, and the fear resulting from the uncertainty about the performance of global markets is palpable. And yet, even though it directly affects my retirement portfolio, I am tired of hearing about what the stock market is doing and how investors are responding to every utterance by a politician or action by a rating agency.
The stock market is not the collective conscience and soul of the nation, and should not be used as a measurement of all things wise and wonderful. The media obsession with the market is only panicking the herd, so knock it off.

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: Mending the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Past Time for a New Agenda'' (editorial, Aug. 9): 
In the face of Standard & Poor's downgrade of America's credit rating, a volatile stock market and a jittery public, President Obama needs to display real leadership and take decisive action on the economy.
Mr. Obama must offer a plan with specific ideas for creating jobs by investing in infrastructure, and for reducing the deficit by increasing the age for Medicare beneficiaries, using means-testing for Social Security recipients, reforming the tax code to close loopholes and make it fairer, ending subsidies for giant corporations, bringing all of our troops home from Afghanistan by Christmas and eliminating the Bush tax cuts for the super-rich.
This plan should be given to Congressional leaders with the proviso that it must be passed before the end of this year. Mr. Obama should take a 50-state tour to present this plan to the American people, who should put pressure on their representatives to vote for it.
If Congress, notably the Republicans, fails to enact his plan, it will bear the responsibility for the consequences.

HEADLINE: Senator Murray Is Chosen As a Leader of Deficit Panel

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington, will be co-chairwoman of a powerful new Congressional committee that is supposed to recommend at least $1.5 trillion of additional deficit-reduction measures, the Senate majority leader announced Tuesday.
The leader, Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, also appointed two other Democratic senators, Max Baucus of Montana and John Kerry of Massachusetts, to the panel. 
Mr. Baucus is chairman of the Finance Committee, which has authority over Medicare, Medicaid and taxes -- three prime areas of attention for the new 12-member panel, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction.
Mr. Kerry, the Democrats' presidential nominee in 2004, is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
Mrs. Murray, who won a tough re-election race last year, is a member of the Senate Democratic leadership, the Senate Appropriations Committee and the Budget Committee. Her selection raised eyebrows among Republicans because she is also chairwoman of the Senate Democrats' campaign arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
In that role, Mrs. Murray recently attacked Republican candidates, saying they wanted to turn Medicare ''into a voucher program run by for-profit insurance companies in order to pay for more giveaways to oil companies and the very rich.''
Mr. Reid said Mrs. Murray, a senator since 1993, had deep knowledge of budget issues and had shown an ability to ''work across party lines.''
That skill will be useful in the joint committee, which will be evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans, with a seven-vote majority needed to make recommendations. ''The world is watching the work of this committee,'' Mr. Reid said.
Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, called on Mr. Reid to withdraw Mrs. Murray's name.
''The select committee is no place for someone whose top priority is fund-raising and politics,'' Mr. Priebus said.
The three Democratic senators named to the panel said they hoped to work with Republicans in ''a balanced, pragmatic and practical way,'' without ''the red-hot partisanship and brinkmanship of the last months.''
Mr. Baucus has a history as a centrist. He broke with other Democrats and supported tax cuts enacted in 2001 under President George W. Bush. He also worked with Republicans in 2003 to pass legislation that added a prescription drug benefit to Medicare.
More recently, Mr. Baucus helped kill Mr. Bush's plan to add private investment accounts to Social Security and helped win passage of President Obama's economic stimulus bill in 2009. He was also a principal author of the new health care law and can be expected to resist Republican efforts to roll back major provisions of that law.
The other panel members will be appointed by Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio; the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky; and the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi of California. Mr. Boehner will pick the other co-chairman.
Among the Republicans mentioned as candidates for the panel are Senators Jon Kyl of Arizona, Rob Portman of Ohio and Mike Johanns of Nebraska and Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the chairman of the House Budget Committee. Democratic contenders include Representatives Chris Van Hollen of Maryland and James E. Clyburn of South Carolina.
The panel is free to examine a wide range of options to cut spending and raise revenue. It is supposed to vote on recommendations by Nov. 23. Under the new deficit-reduction law, the package is supposed to receive an up-or-down vote in the House and the Senate by Dec. 23. If Congress does not enact sufficient savings, the government would automatically cut spending in scores of military and nonmilitary programs.

HEADLINE: Pawlenty Seeks Out Religious Voters in Iowa

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
CLIVE, Iowa - For the small gathering of Iowa faith leaders, Tim Pawlenty offered a mix of religion and get-it-done realism.
''The privileges, the liberties, the freedoms, the blessings that we enjoy, come from our creator, God,'' Mr. Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, said on Monday night. ''We want a candidate to emerge in this race who I think understands not just the values, not just the issues, but also the commitment to get it done.''
As he heads toward what could be a make-or-break moment for his presidential campaign this weekend, Mr. Pawlenty, who has lagged in polls and fund-raising, is not giving up on the evangelical voters who are so often the cornerstone of Republican victories here. His outreach to religious voters, as well as to home-school advocates and opponents of same-sex marriage, is part of an urgent try-everything, try-anything strategy that his advisers hope will lead to a better-than-expected showing in the Iowa Straw Poll on Saturday. His advisers have said he must move from the ''back of the pack to the front of the pack'' in the poll, which tests organizational strength and has often catapulted candidates, or signaled their demise. 
On Tuesday morning, Mr. Pawlenty was the lone Republican presidential candidate to help kick off a 22-county tour of Iowa by the Value Voter Bus, thanking the evangelical activists sponsoring the trip for ''standing for a culture of life.'' He has started a Web site, Pawlentyfaith.com. And in between stops on the bus, he is meeting privately with the state's religious leaders.
But he has an uphill battle as he scours Iowa for supporters who will cast ballots on Saturday. Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota is courting the same voters and does so with gusto. At an event Sunday, she offered a long prayer for the military personnel who died in a helicopter crash in Afghanistan over the weekend.
Bob Vander Plaats, the head of Iowa Family Leader, an influential faith group, said Mrs. Bachmann ''has a certain pizazz about her.'' But he added that Mr. Pawlenty had ''reached out to this base very authentically and genuinely.''
''He's probably more the tortoise in the race, but I think he's gaining ground as well,'' Mr. Vander Plaats said.
Mr. Pawlenty is in the middle of a packed schedule of campaigning that is focused on the small towns within a half-hour of Ames, the site of the straw poll. While his rivals campaign in the far reaches of the state, Mr. Pawlenty is betting on the people most likely to make a short trip to Iowa State University for the poll.
His stump speech is emphatic and even angry at some points as he sharply criticizes President Obama, calling him ''inept'' and saying his presidency has been ''misguided, misfocused, misprioritized, misdirected.'' Once Mr. Pawlenty starts talking, he hardly takes a breath or gives the typically small audiences a chance to react.
Unlike Mrs. Bachmann, who seems to thrive on the energy of a crowd, Mr. Pawlenty does not seem to particularly enjoy campaigning. But paradoxically, his campaign is betting on his performances with these small gatherings of voters.
At stop after stop, he tells whoever will listen that they will hear similar promises from his rivals. But, he says, none of them have the executive experience he has.
''Any bobblehead can stand up here and give you the words of the Republican checklist. That doesn't take any particular talent,'' he told about two dozen people at Rich's Brew, a coffeehouse in the town of Johnston. ''The question is, Have you actually done it?''
Mr. Pawlenty is careful not to say what specific ''bobblehead'' he is talking about. But it is clear from the context of his remarks that he is concerned about Mrs. Bachmann, who has surged in the polls in recent weeks.
Without naming Mrs. Bachmann, Mr. Pawlenty is hoping to raise questions about the experience she would bring to confronting the nation's economic challenges. And to religious voters, he is hoping to make the case that her flash and pizazz is less impressive than the steps he took as governor to back traditional marriage and oppose abortion.
At the start of the values bus tour, Mr. Pawlenty emphasized his credentials in brief remarks in front of activists and reporters on the steps of the Iowa Capitol.
''In Minnesota, one of the most challenging political environments in the country for a conservative, I was able to advance these issues,'' Mr. Pawlenty said. ''We will ultimately win this cause and advance the culture of life in this country by winning over the hearts and minds of the people.''
Then he added, ''I hope that you'll come to Ames this Saturday to be part of the straw poll.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Disney Beats Expectations, Posting 11% Rise in Profit

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
After two wild quarters - leaping in the first and missing big in the second - the Walt Disney Company returned to its calm and collected ways on Tuesday, reporting profit slightly above Wall Street's predictions. 
Disney, the world's largest media company, said net income for its fiscal third quarter rose to $1.48 billion, or 77 cents a share. That compares with income of $1.3 billion, or 67 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue climbed 7 percent, to $10.68 billion. Analysts had expected income of 73 cents a share.
But the big question for Disney centers on the coming months: if its sprawling theme parks in Florida and California are bellwethers for consumer confidence, as many investors believe, how are the gloomy financial markets and fears of a double-dip recession affecting bookings heading into the crucial holiday season? Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, was expected to address that question in a conference call with analysts late Tuesday afternoon. In May, when Mr. Iger last updated analysts on the company's theme parks, he offered a mixed picture, noting that future bookings were down 2.5 percent but pricing was slightly up.
Price increases, which reflect an end to promotional packages offered during the height of the recession, helped drive operating income at the company's parks up 9 percent, to $519 million, in the most recent quarter. Hong Kong Disneyland and the Disney Cruise Line also contributed to improved results, offset by Tokyo Disneyland, which continued to feel the impact of the March earthquake that hobbled Japan.
As usual, Disney's overall results were powered by its Media Networks division, which includes assets like ESPN, Disney Channel, the ABC broadcast network and local TV stations. Operating income in that unit rose 11 percent, to $2.09 billion, largely due to higher carriage payments for ESPN from cable providers.
Like other media conglomerates, Disney's television advertising revenue has rebounded, although ESPN's ad sales in the quarter were flat as higher rates were offset by the absence of World Cup games. Lower programming costs benefited ABC, where ad sales increased.
Highlighting the difficult economics of the movie business, operating income at Walt Disney Studios fell 60 percent, to $49 million, despite hits like ''Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides'' and ''Thor.'' In the year-earlier quarter, Disney 's movie releases - ''Toy Story 3'' and ''Iron Man 2'' - were stronger ticket sellers; they were also cheaper to make and market.
Only a few days of ticket sales for ''Cars 2'' made it into the most recent quarter, which ended on July 2. But ''Cars 2'' did deliver a 32 percent increase in operating income, to $155 million, at the company's consumer products division.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Day Our Leaders Got Unstuck

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
This is a scary economic moment. The response we need is not easy, but it is totally obvious. We need a Grand Bargain between America's two parties -- and we need it right now. Until you read the following news article, we'll be stuck in a world of hurt.
Washington (AP) -- It was a news conference the likes of which the White House had never seen. President Obama stood in the East Room, flanked by the House speaker, John Boehner; the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell; the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid; and the House minority leader, Nancy Pelosi. The president asked Mr. Boehner to speak first: 
''My fellow Americans,'' the Ohio Republican began. ''We have just concluded a meeting with the president, prompted by this moment of extraordinary economic peril. Our party, as you know, is convinced that the main reason for our economic decline is that we have too much debt, that government has grown too big and that taxes and regulations are choking our dynamism. But I have to acknowledge that, over the years, our party has contributed to this debt burden and government spending binge. We are not innocent, and, therefore, we owe the country a strategy for governing and for fixing a problem that we helped to create -- instead of just blocking the president. The G.O.P. is better than that and has more to offer the nation. Therefore, we have informed the president that our legislators are ready to reopen negotiations immediately on a 'Grand Bargain' to address all these debt issues once and for all and that everything will be on the table from our side -- including tax reform that closes loopholes and eliminates wasteful subsidies, and, if need be, tax increases. To those who voted for us, rest assured that we will bring our conservative values to these negotiations and an emphasis on markets and meritocracies, but also a spirit of compromise and a recognition that both sides will have to bend if we are going to get the kind of comprehensive budget agreement the country needs. To my Tea Party colleagues, I say: thank you. Your passion helped spur the nation to action, but the country cannot be governed, and our future secured, by bowing solely to the passions of any single group -- liberal or conservative. I know that the Tea Party activists are true patriots and they will work with us as well. President Obama: Let's fix the country together and then compete in 2012 over who can best manage a growing pie rather than a shrinking one.''
President Obama warmly embraced Mr. Boehner and then took the podium and said:
''Speaker Boehner and Senator McConnell, thank you for your commitment to act in our nation's highest interests. Let me say publicly what I committed to you privately: I have asked Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson to revive their deficit commission and to use their recommendations for how to cut spending and raise revenues as the starting point for our negotiations. But it will now be called 'The National Commission for American Renewal.' Because in addition to the original Bowles-Simpson members, it will include Senator McConnell, Speaker Boehner, Senator Reid and Congresswoman Pelosi, and its goal will indeed be a comprehensive plan for American renewal. Everything will be on the table -- spending cuts, tax reform and increases, a framework for restructuring the debts of Americans whose homes are under water and the investments we need to renew the primary sources of our strength -- infrastructure, education and scientific research. Each component will be integrated and timed to minimize pain and maximize job creation -- and the entire package will be presented to Congress for an up-or-down vote. I am confident that real tax and entitlement reform will unleash billions of dollars in investments.
''But the most important thing that will be on the table will not just be a plan to make our country solvent. It will be a plan to make America great and guarantee that another generation will enjoy the American dream. Any fair-minded person who looks at all the stimulus investments I've made in education, clean energy, research and infrastructure can see that this has been my goal from the start. But I know those investments can't be sustained without a new long-term budget deal. And I, too, have a confession: I've done a poor job integrating my nation-building ideas, including health care, into a single vision so people understood where I was going. I also let tactical political considerations -- like abandoning the Bowles-Simpson commission -- intervene, so Americans lost sight of my priorities. That will not happen again. No one loves this country more than I and my Democratic colleagues. While we will bring our traditional concerns for social justice and equality to these negotiations, we will not quit until a Grand Bargain to ensure American greatness is enacted into law.''
At that point, all five leaders shook hands and retreated into the Oval Office. It was exactly 9:29 a.m. One minute later, the New York Stock Exchange opened. The Dow was up 1,223 points at the open -- an all-time record.
What's sad is how much this is a fantasy and how easily -- with just a little political will -- it could be a reality.

HEADLINE: A Test for Obama's View of a One-Term Presidency

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- It was a year and a half ago when President Obama told Diane Sawyer of ABC News in an interview that he would rather be a good one-term president than a mediocre two-term president.
Now, coming off one of his worst weeks since taking office, Mr. Obama is nearing a decision on whether he really meant that. Is he willing to try to administer the disagreeable medicine that could help the economy mend over the long term, even if that means damaging his chances for re-election? 
The Federal Reserve's finding on Tuesday that there is little prospect for rapid economic growth over the next two years was the latest in a summer of bad economic news. One administration official called the atmosphere around the president's economic team ''angry and morose.''
There was no word on the mood of the president's political team, but it was unlikely to be buoyed by the Fed's assertion that the economy would still be faltering well past Mr. Obama's second inauguration, should he win another term.
''The problem for Obama is that right now, the United States is either at a precipice or has fallen off it,'' said David Rothkopf, a Commerce Department official in the Clinton administration. ''If he is true to his commitment to rather be a good one-term president, then this is the character test. In some respects, this is the 3 a.m. phone call.''
Mr. Obama, Mr. Rothkopf argues, has to focus in the next 18 months on getting the economy back on track for the long haul, even if that means pushing for politically unpalatable budget cuts, including real -- but hugely unpopular -- reductions in entitlement programs and the military, in exchange for a ''grand bargain'' in which the cuts would come in exchange for significant job-creating stimulus and increased tax revenues.
A longtime Republican strategist echoed Mr. Rothkopf. Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Senator John McCain when he ran for president, said Mr. Obama ''has got two big problems'' -- the unemployment rate and the budget deficit.
''Frankly, there's not a whole lot he can do about jobs now,'' Mr. Black said. ''But it would help if we got the deficit under control, and to do that, you've got to reform entitlements.''
For instance, he argued, Mr. Obama should tackle Social Security, leaving the system in place for those 55 and older but establishing means tests to determine benefits for those under 55. If Mr. Obama did that, Mr. Black said, ''he could be a hero like Bill Clinton was when he negotiated with Trent Lott and Newt Gingrich'' on the 1997 budget.
If Mr. Black's take is correct and there is little the president can do about jobs, that is more bad news. In a New York Times/CBS News poll released last week, 62 percent of those responding said that creating jobs was the No. 1 priority, while only 29 percent said cutting the deficit should be the top goal.
But whether Mr. Obama focuses on a short-term stimulus like job creation or long-range steps like deficit reduction, he will still have to beg, exhort and threaten Congress to take action in a meaningful way.
''No matter what we do, it still takes two to tango,'' said Dan Pfeiffer, White House director of communications. ''And the Republican Party to date has been entirely unwilling to compromise in any way, shape or form to actually do the things it takes to tackle the big problems.''
According to a traditional story line, Mr. Obama's hopes for a second term could be undercut as he is forced to defend politically unpopular proposals in an election year -- and end up stonewalled by Republicans in the end.
Some of Mr. Obama's political allies try to spin the story the other way, criticizing him for not coming out yet with public plans to both cut the deficit and stimulate the economy. They argue that the boldness of such steps could actually help him win a second term -- or at least burnish his place in history. One Democratic adviser to the president, speaking on the ground of anonymity because he did not want to criticize Mr. Obama publicly, said, ''He's got to be willing to let the chips fall where they may.''
So far, White House officials said Tuesday, Mr. Obama has repeatedly been putting country over campaign, including canceling several Democratic fund-raisers in July when the debt ceiling negotiations were dragging on. And, they say, he is not shying from politically unpalatable choices, demonstrating his willingness during the debt ceiling negotiations to make cuts in entitlements and programs dear to the hearts of Democrats.
On Monday night, he did attend two fund-raisers in Washington (casting his re-election as an ''unfinished project'' at one) while on Thursday he will head to Michigan to make the case that his bailout program helped save the auto industry.
On Tuesday afternoon, the White House announced that Mr. Obama would be taking an ''economic bus tour'' in the Midwest next week, with stops in Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota. ''The president knows we must do everything we can to promote economic growth, restore confidence in our nation's future and restore the sense of optimism for future generations,'' the statement said.
Though the trip is not a campaign event, it could help shape voters' perceptions of whether Mr. Obama is more concerned about being remembered for that one good term or whether he wants another four years in the Oval Office no matter what.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 11, 2011

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: A news analysis article on Wednesday about President Obama's handling of the economy paraphrased incompletely from comments by David Rothkopf, a former Clinton administration Commerce Department official, about steps that Mr. Obama should take to fix the economy and budget deficit. While Mr. Rothkopf called for the president to push for politically unpalatable budget cuts to entitlement programs and the military, he also said the president should do so in the context of a ''grand bargain'' in which the cuts would come in exchange for significant job-creating stimulus and increased tax revenues.

HEADLINE: Dismal Thoughts

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Intellectual failure on an epic scale.

 BODY:
To be an economist of my stripe these days -- basically a Keynes-via-Hicks type, who concluded as soon as Lehman fell that we were in a classic liquidity trap with all that implied -- is a bittersweet experience, with the bitter vastly greater than the sweet.
The good news, such as it is, is that our underlying model has performed very well. Interest rates have stayed low despite large government borrowing; crowding out has been totally absent; huge increases in the monetary base have not been highly inflationary.
The bad news is that policy makers almost everywhere have failed dismally, and seem determined not to take on board the lessons of experience, either historical or what we've learned the past few years. As Joe Stiglitz says, 
When the recession began there were many wise words about having learnt the lessons of both the Great Depression and Japan's long malaise. Now we know we didn't learn a thing. Our stimulus was too weak, too short and not well designed. The banks weren't forced to return to lending. Our leaders tried papering over the economy's weaknesses - perhaps out of fear that if we were honest about them, already fragile confidence would erode. But that was a gamble we have now lost. Now the scale of the problem is apparent, a new confidence has emerged: confidence that matters will get worse, whatever action we take. A long malaise now seems like the optimistic scenario.
Robert Reich, talking to people in the administration, says that there has been a deliberate decision to focus on the wrong issues, : 
So rather than fight for a bold jobs plan, the White House has apparently decided it's politically wiser to continue fighting about the deficit. The idea is to keep the public focused on the deficit drama - to convince them their current economic woes have something to do with it, decry Washington's paralysis over fixing it, and then claim victory over whatever outcome emerges from the process recently negotiated to fix it. They hope all this will distract the public's attention from the President's failure to do anything about continuing high unemployment and economic anemia.
And in Europe, says Kantoos Economics, a low inflation target has become a sacred icon even though all evidence --including the experience under the gold standard! -- says that this will be fatal:
I sincerely do hope that I read the wrong newspapers and missed all those European economists and commentators screaming all these things (or even better: that I am wrong). But whenever I try to hear something, there is just silence - or Axel Weber lashing out at Olivier Blanchard. Meanwhile, European policy makers and central bankers are wrecking one of the most fascinating projects in human history, the unity and friendship among the countries of Europe. This is beyond depressing. Way beyond.
I'm still trying to make sense of this global intellectual failure. But the results are not in question: we are making a total mess of a solvable problem, with consequences that will haunt us for decades to come.

HEADLINE: Interest Rate Follies

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong. And nothing learned.

 BODY:
I don't have time to do all the references, but here's a quick summary of what Very Serious People have been saying over the past 2 1/2 years:
May 2009: Interest rates have risen on hopes of recovery, but lots of people claim that we're seeing crowding out by government borrowing; the WSJ announces that the bond vigilantes, the "disciplinarians" of US policy, have arrived.
Fall 2009: Although rates keep refusing to soar, the story I hear is that it's all because hedge funds are borrowing short and lending long, and that it's going to end in grief any day now when this "carry trade" collapses. Obama goes on Fox and says that we have to cut the deficit or we'll have a double dip.
May 2010: A slight rise in rates due to renewed optimism about recovery is described in news reports -- and this is reported as a fact, not a speculation -- as a sign of worries about US debt. Meanwhile, the OECD calls for immediate rate hikes.
Fall 2010-present: Despite the persistence of low rates, politicians and pundits state -- again, as a fact, not a hypothesis -- that we're going to have a terrible crisis within 2 years if the deficit isn't slashed.
Meanwhile, some us worked with a very different story: the Fed will determine short rates, and the long rate reflects expected future short rates. And the Fed will keep short rates near zero as long as the economy remains deeply depressed. So the long rate reflects beliefs about prospects for recovery, and hence of an eventual move off the zero-rate policy. According to this view, a weaker economy will push rates down even as it raises the deficit.
And right now, with the 10-year rate at 2.19% -- 2.19%! -- the market is basically signaling that it doesn't care a bit about the deficit, but that it's terrified about growth prospects.
But I'm not a Serious Person.

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: And now all of us are paying the price.

 BODY:
PUB-DATE: May 29, 2009:
They're back. We refer to the global investors once known as the bond vigilantes, who demanded higher Treasury bond yields from the late 1970s through the 1990s whenever inflation fears popped up, and as a result disciplined U.S. policy makers. The vigilantes vanished earlier this decade amid the credit mania, but they appear to be returning with a vengeance now that Congress and the Federal Reserve have flooded the world with dollars to beat the recession.
Today:
What does it take for a media outlet to be permanently disbarred from making economic commentary?
But here's the thing: it wasn't just the WSJ. Pundits, Very Serious Politicians, and more have spent the past two years plus doing everything they can to make the deficit the center of public discourse, to focus all our fears on the attack by bond vigilantes that was supposedly just over the horizon. 
And now it turns out that what really terrifies the markets, let alone the suffering unemployed, is the prospect of a second Great Depression -- a prospect that has become much more likely thanks to the utter wrongness of elite policy priorities.
Great work, guys.

HEADLINE: Times Readers React to the London Riots

BYLINE: BASSEY ETIM


HIGHLIGHT: New York Times readers react to the riots in Britain.

 BODY:
In response to the riots in Britain, NYTimes.com readers have largely divided into two camps. Many of our British readers view the riots as the sum of a materialistic culture and a welfare state that has spoiled its citizenry. Others, while refusing to support violent tactics, believe the rich have hoarded their nation's wealth, and the resulting social unrest is inevitable. Here is a sampling of some of the nearly 700 comments we received on yesterday's articles and blog posts. 
"The government is rightly cutting expenditure and with it, benefits," writes Ian Cresswell in Stourport on Severn, U.K. "[Those dependent on the welfare state] believe it's the state that owes them a living and always want more. They then sink to theft."
Eden, a London teenager who compared her experience to "living in a Clash song," disagrees. "I don't believe all these young people are mindless criminals," Eden wrote. "They have a political conscious and do not feel represented by the millionaires that run our country." 
Some British readers, angered by the rioters' destruction, compare them to wild animals. 
"Most the of the 'destitute' feral youth who are burning and looting in London live in council houses/flats," hn in London writes. "That is, places to live where they don't need to pay mortgage or rent, thanks to the very government that they pretend to be complaining about."
However, based on the tone of the most recommended reader comments a majority of NYTimes.com readers feel as if comments like hn's are another symptom of an out-of-touch upper class. 
"You deride the 'cutbacks in social programs' but it is simply not true to say there are plenty of jobs in London," Hooj in London wrote in response to hn. "My son has been unable to find work He did have an unpaid intern job for a while, but that employer simply rotated the available roles to all the other unemployed graduates."
Some readers questioned why so much outrage is being directed at apparently underprivileged rioters. 
"This violence is regrettable and counterproductive," AER in England wrote. "Meanwhile there are other people who cause far greater devastation They are the corporate neoliberal elite, and their vandalism is far worse."
James in Brooklyn, N.Y. also implicates corporate actors: "People forget that the reason the New Deal came about was not because the barons cared about the common man, it was because they were scared to death that the Russian revolution would spread here. You can call it socialism. I call it suppression."
In response to these sorts of arguments, Kidsdoc in New York crystallized the point of those who see the 'social unrest' angle as a convenient excuse for criminality. "I lived in the U.K. long enough to realize that the rioters are unemployed thugs who are also lazy and bored," Kidsdoc wrote, with the recommendation of over 130 readers. "NYT, this is not really a social upheaval as you are portraying."
JL in London attempted to get to the root of the looting: "This is the real issue facing the West: too many people fed on consumerism and obsessed with the perceived social status these products give and not enough emphasis in social life, education systems and popular culture on ethics, morality and being an intelligent person of substance."
FEN, in the English county of Devon, attempted to get to the root of the anger. "Many (perhaps most) white people in Britain do not want black people living in their neighbourhoods," FEN wrote. "This has perpetuated the ghettos that have produced several generations of desperate young people who perceive that there is no hope that they might share in the benefits enjoyed by white society."
The prevailing theme we've seen in NYTimes.com reader comments since the financial crisis began is that average people feel as if they have no chance to make a meaningful impact on government and social policy. This has gone beyond the normal apathy of the individual, who might see no reason to add one insignificant vote to the ledger. Our readers increasingly feel that voting itself is a diversion because the true decisions are made at a level above the electorate. 
In response to a Lede blog post on the fact that most British police officers do not carry guns, several readers wrote from Britain to say that there is no groundswell of support for arming the police there because restrictions on gun ownership mean that criminals are not often armed either. 
One reader from Manchester, who writes as Julianzzz, added these thoughts:
Here's a voice from the North of England. The rioters are youths as young as 11, so gun use is out, they are led by older people of 20 or so, using secure Blackberry communications to organise "flashmobs". The core comes from a criminal underclass and from estates that are poor, productive industries globalised out of existence. They are obsessed with "Bling" and American Rap "culture" and wish to act out their violent fantasies of American "street" culture, they even refer to the police as the "Feds" we have County police forces "Feds" is a wholly American term. Rap culture and technology have proved to be a toxic mix. The youngsters sense of being victimised would increase ten fold if there were deaths, there would be much more destruction. The way forward comes from the response of communities, the Turks and Sikhs in London who defended their property, the white and black communities who came on-mass to clear up.
We've started a new comment thread focusing on today's discord in London, and, as always, we encourage you to share your thoughts.

HEADLINE: Latest Updates on the Financial Markets

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: The Lede continues to follow the global financial markets on Wednesday.

 BODY:
9:41 A.M. | Ready for Another Wild One
After Tuesday's roller coaster stock market, investors may be in for an equally wild ride today. The S.&P. 500 fell more than 2 percent at the opening bell, while the Dow Jones industrial average dropped by a similar percentage.
That is in sharp contrast to Tuesday afternoon, when the Federal Reserve's pledge to hold short-term interest-rates near zero for at least two more years help fuel a stock market rally.
The Fed action helped lift stocks in Asia on Wednesday, but the rally was not sustained during morning trading in Europe. The Euro Stoxx 50 index of euro zone blue chips moved in and out of positive territory, and was down 2.25 percent in afternoon trading.
Bank stocks have seen some of the biggest swings, and they could also experience volatility again on Wednesday. In particular, investors will be tuning into an open conference call at 1 p.m. with Brian Moynihan, Bank of America's chief executive, in which he will layout his plans to one of the company's biggest shareholders, Fairholme Funds.
And given the bank's vast exposure to the American consumer, investors will be looking to his remarks to gauge the depth of the nation's current economic troubles. .
In the meantime, investors are largely digesting the impact of Tuesday's Fed action. On the on hand, the Fed's commitment to keep interest rates near-zero for a long time could bode well for banks and businesses that will have so long as borrowing costs remain low. On the other hand, the Fed's action also highlights the grim state of the American economy - otherwise, it would not have been necessary. -

HEADLINE: In U.S. Stress Tests, a Tool to Gauge Contagion in Europe

BYLINE: JESSE EISINGER


HIGHLIGHT: As European debt fears mount again, the question is whether the data truly reflects all the risks to American banks.

 BODY:
In early 2010, top officials at the Federal Reserve began to wonder: how would United States banks hold up through the European debt crisis? Investors were fleeing Greece and Ireland, and starting to get nervous about Portugal and Spain, spreading contagion.
The conclusion from the stress tests that resulted was heartening to supervisors at the regulator, according to a person who was directly involved in the exercise: American banks didn't have too much exposure to Portugal and Spain, so the contagion would not be a problem.
Unless it hit Italy.
"At the time, the results made us a bit relieved; our focus was on Ireland and Greece," said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Fed has a policy of not discussing supervisory actions. "But if Italy goes, God help us all."
American banks had not only a small exposure to Italian government bonds, but a larger one to Italian banks and companies. If the European debt crisis spread to Italy, it could cause another global financial catastrophe. Only this time, global regulators might have fewer weapons to combat it. The Fed declined to comment on its analysis.
And that is why last week was so terrifying, scarier than either the stock market drop or the Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States credit rating: debtholders had abandoned Spain and Italy.
At one point on Friday, Italian bonds were trading at more than 400 basis points higher than Germany's, a signal of panic. Italy has a huge debt load. If investors began to focus on that, it wasn't clear what might stop the run.
The European Central Bank intervened this week, buying Spanish and Italian government bonds. On Monday, the panic eased in Europe, with Italian and Spanish interest rates falling. The French and Germans announced that the European Financial Stability Facility (clearly named by Dr. Seuss) would be able to buy those government bonds when it was up and running in late September.
By Wednesday, the fears were back, as French banks got hit especially hard. The problem is that Europe has tried repeatedly to fence off the problem, only to have it escape again to wreak havoc. Greece and Ireland have each been through several rounds of failed bailouts and extensions. If they are bankrupt, and not simply victims of investor panic, then someone, somewhere will have to take losses. And if Spain and Italy start to go down, those losses threaten the global economy.
European banks are on the front lines, vulnerable because they are more thinly capitalized than their American counterparts. Europe has conducted stress tests, just as the Fed has, but they haven't instilled confidence, in part because they didn't subject most sovereign debt holdings to any loss estimates.
The tests did require vast disclosures, however, so that investors and analysts could delve into the numbers and conduct their own analyses.
If European banks go down, what will happen to American banks? Investors and analysts seem unconcerned. American banks disclose some of their exposure to specific countries, but the information isn't up to date and the figures depend on opaque estimates of how well hedged the banks are. Analysts differ on the amounts at risk.
According to a note from the research firm CLSA on July 13, Citigroup had $12.7 billion in Italian holdings, much of it government-related, while JPMorgan Chase had $12.2 billion. According to a note from BernsteinResearch, JPMorgan had "less than $20 billion" in exposure to Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain combined. But that was going in the wrong direction, up from "less than $15 billion" at the end of 2010, when one might expect the banks to be paring exposure.
These aren't large numbers, less than 1 percent of these gigantic banks' balance sheets. And banks wouldn't take 100 percent losses on their investments in the event of a default.
Unfortunately, we simply don't know whether the analysts are right. Neither the Fed nor the Securities and Exchange Commission has forced United States banks to make as detailed disclosures as the European stress tests did of its banks. So it's a matter of having to trust the banks and the regulators.
Which brings us back to the exercise the Fed undertook last year. Two Fed officials ordered up the analysis: Daniel K. Tarullo, the board member who oversees matters of bank supervision, and Patrick Parkinson, the head of banking supervision, who is reported to have undergone a conversion from a Alan Greenspan antiregulation acolyte to a believer in strong oversight. Clinton D. Lively, a number-cruncher who recently left the New York Fed, was one of the officials who played a major role.
Disturbingly, before the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed, which is the most important bank regulator and is charged with keeping the banking system safe and sound, couldn't really do this kind of analysis, according to former Fed officials. It might have asked banks for the data on their exposures to specific countries, but it couldn't play out a chain of events very easily. What if the central bank wanted to know what would happen to United States banks if the euro fell 20 percent in a short period? The Fed didn't have the tools.
Now it does, thanks in part to the efforts of Mr. Lively and others. The assessment came with its own pitfalls. At time the Fed was gathering the data, a rumor started in markets that the Fed was worried about two Spanish banks. Some European banking supervisors became nervous about the Fed's efforts and voiced those concerns.
Unfortunately, the biggest problem is whether the data truly reflects all the risks. That continues to be a matter of intense debate within the central bank. Given the complexity of the trading arrangements within the global financial system, it's far from clear that the banks have a handle on their own exposures. As we learned in 2008, hedges that seemed solid on Monday disappear on Tuesday.
Nevertheless, it's good to know that the Fed isn't flying blind.

HEADLINE: A Governor

BYLINE: LINDA GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: With government dysfunction much the norm in recent years, an account of Governor Hugh L. Carey's tenure, when politicians pulled together across party lines and government really worked, is instructive.

 BODY:
I've always liked bridges and been a bit phobic about tunnels, particularly those that run under water. So when I read late last year that the Queensboro Bridge was being named after New York's former mayor, Edward I. Koch, and the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel for Hugh L. Carey, I felt that the former governor was being cheated. After all, the Tappan Zee Bridge, still majestic in its sweep across the Hudson even in its current dilapidated state, was named after Malcolm Wilson, the man Carey defeated for governor in 1974. And Robert F. Kennedy got the Triborough Bridge.
But thinking more about the matter of public-works monuments after Governor Carey's death on Sunday, I've decided that the tunnel was the right choice. A tunnel is infrastructure, and Hugh Carey, "the man who saved New York," as a book published last year called him, was all about infrastructure. Under a river, a tunnel does its job by remaining solidly grounded, keeping the water out, invisible to anyone above. When Hugh Carey departed Albany more than 28 years ago, after two terms as governor, he left public finance on more solid ground than it had been in years. For the most part, he remained out of politics, all but disappearing from public view. An entire generation of New Yorkers has come of age with no memory of the man.
That's unfortunate, because the career of Governor Carey, a seven-term congressman from Brooklyn before he took on the Democratic Party establishment, beat the favorite in a primary, and captured the governor's office after 16 years of Republican rule, has much to teach. He did what public officeholders are elected to do. He actually governed.
He came into office in January 1975 under circumstances that resonate eerily with today's headlines. It quickly became apparent that the new governor had inherited a huge financial mess. A major state agency, the Urban Development Corporation, financed by a gimmick called "moral obligation bonds" that did not obligate the agency to pay off its debt, was out of cash and facing imminent default. New York City, reliant on issuing increasingly expensive short-term debt to cover a structural deficit amounting to billions of dollars, faced being shut out of the financial markets entirely.
With resolve and without grandstanding, declaring that "the days of wine and roses are over," Governor Carey dug into this multi-dimensional crisis by recruiting the best minds available to help find solutions. He had not even personally known most of those who became his closest advisors. He jawboned the banks and the public employee unions. He made allies out of natural enemies. He worked productively with the leadership of the Republican-controlled State Senate and the Democratic-controlled Assembly. He took calculated, even audacious risks, effectively daring the state Court of Appeals to say no to a moratorium on repayment of New York City's debt, which was essential to give the city some temporary breathing room. The crisis went on for more than a year. There was no quick fix, and the end result wasn't pretty. But ultimately, it worked, in part because he made everyone realize that the consequences of it not working were unthinkable.
I witnessed all this as a reporter in this newspaper's Albany bureau during the first three years of the Carey administration. I had covered his 1974 race, often as the only reporter traveling around the state with him in the two-passenger plane that his underdog campaign could afford in the early months. "Where's the plane?" "Get in!" The accounts of his big accomplishments and small foibles that appeared this week fell short, in my estimation, of taking his full measure, and certainly didn't capture the sheer thrill of those crucial months as everyone -- the governor, the legislature, the press corps -- climbed the same steep learning curve into the unknown.
This failure is understandable, at least to a degree, because government dysfunction in Albany, Washington, and elsewhere has been so much the norm in recent years that an account, however accurate, of a time when politicians pulled together across party lines and government really worked sounds credulous. So does a description of an elected official who acts out of deep conviction, as Governor Carey did when he vetoed the bills the Legislature kept sending him to restore the death penalty in New York.
My piece of Opinionator real estate is supposed to be about law. I could make the argument that this column is about law. Governor Carey was a lawyer, and much of the solution to the fiscal crisis was accomplished through legislation; the ink has faded on the governor's signature on the framed copy that I still have, complete with signing pen, of the bill that gave birth to the Municipal Assistance Corporation, created by the state Legislature to restore the city's access to the financial markets. Law, after all, is not an end in itself. It is a tool by which a civilized society organizes itself to pursue common ends.
But really this column is simply an effort to give a good man his due. I last saw Governor Carey in the spring of 2008, when a dinner in his honor was organized as a fund-raiser for theJustice Project, a nonprofit organization that works to improve the criminal justice system. I was still a working reporter, but I bought a ticket and attended as a citizen. The governor, then 89, was physically frail but mentally sharp, quick as ever with the double-entendres and gentle zingers. Unexpectedly, I was asked to speak. Fully aware that the journalism police are quick to pounce on any colleague who dares express an opinion on a public issue or person, I nonetheless said what I thought: that Hugh Carey was the finest public official it had been my privilege to know.
Thinking further on the subject of bridge versus tunnel, it really doesn't matter. His monument is today's New York City itself.

HEADLINE: From Alpinestars, a Motorcycle Suit That Inflates to Protect the Rider

BYLINE: ROY FURCHGOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The company's new suit, designed for racers on the MotoGP circuit, is now available to casual European riders, with North American sales to follow next summer.

 BODY:
When Jorge Lorenzo, the Yamaha factory racer, was catapulted from his bike in a crash while practicing at Laguna Seca on July 22, sensors in his suit read that he hit the pavement with the force of 25.3 Gs. It's the kind of impact that can shatter bones and careers, but Lorenzo not only walked away from the crash, he placed second at the track two days afterward in the Red Bull United States Grand Prix.
His speedy recovery was attributable in part to a protective suit with built-in air bags. The suit, which has undergone track testing since 2007, recently became available commercially in Europe for the equivalent of $8,500, more than twice the cost for a comparable suit without the protective technology. Alpinestars, the motorcycle apparel company producing the suit, expects to sell it in the United States beginning next summer.
There is at least one more air-bag suit on the European market, from Dainese. Andrea Onida, a spokesman for the manufacturer, said there was no plan to bring the design to North America.
Spread throughout the Alpinestars Tech Air Race Suit are five accelerometers designed to sense the rider's body position, speed and direction of movement. The tricky bit involves programming the accelerators to distinguish between a hard-cornering racer from one who becomes separated from the bike.
"The way we sense that is proprietary information that we don't divulge," said Tim Collins, a spokesman for Alpinestars, in a telephone interview.
The sensors are checked every two milliseconds by a central processor stored in a hump sewn onto the suit's upper back, measuring roughly the same size as a household's double-light-switch plate. If the processor triggers the air bag, it takes 45 milliseconds for a cylinder of nitrogen gas to inflate the shoulder and collarbone protection, typically 100 milliseconds before rider meets pavement, according to Alpinestars' research.
The bags remain inflated for five seconds. A second nitrogen charge is held in reserve in case of a second crash. Alpinestars claims that the batteries that run the system are good for eight hours of riding.
The crash-detection system is considered active when it senses that the rider is seated on a motorcycle and moving. But the suit would not be activated unless its main zipper was closed. Opening the zipper puts the suit in a stand-by mode, which is intended to reduce the chance of accidental inflation. LEDs on the suit's sleeve inform the rider of the system's status.
Made entirely of leather, the suits come in size 38 to 46 and in three color combinations: black and white; black, white and red; and black, white and yellow.
Mr. Collins said the suits were cleared to be sold in the United States, but the introduction was staggered behind Europe while the company increased its production capacity. They are available there in select shops, with a wider unveiling planned over the next two months, he said.
According to Mr. Collins, the bags deployed on the track in major races 36 times in 2010 and 2011.

HEADLINE: The Debt Downgrade and Stock Prices

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The market gyrations go beyond events like the downgrade of United States debt and are being driven by the long-term outlook for the economy, an economist writes.

 BODY:
 
The big financial story in the last few days has been the declaration by Standard & Poor's that United States government bonds were no longer worthy of its AAA rating. The agency, in a nutshell, thinks there is some chance that the government will default or be delinquent on its debt payments. 
The announcement was followed by a wild ride in the stock market in the last two days -- a plunge of almost 7 percent in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index on Monday, followed by a surge of almost 5 percent on Tuesday. 
But with the index down almost 18 percent from its April peak, it is clear that investors' concerns long predated the downgrade. 
The real news is how poorly the economy is doing, and how poor its prospects seem. The chart below shows the changes in several indicators of economic activity over the last nine months. The blue series is an inflation-adjusted stock price index, which (even with Tuesday's big gain) is lower than it was nine months ago. Through May 2011, real housing prices (black series) were down 7 percent. Real consumer spending (red series) has failed to increase, and inflation-adjusted spending on consumer durables has fallen four months in a row.
All of these indicators are forward-looking in the sense that they depend on what people expect to happen to incomes and profits in the future. These indicators had been looking better during much of 2010 but now it seems that consumers and investors are not optimistic about what is ahead (are they worried about riots like in London? higher taxes? government program cuts?).
In my view, a rating agency does not move the market but rather reacts to some of the same prospects that are reflected in the decisions of consumers and investors. For example, to the degree that incomes continue to remain low, tax collections will also remain low, making it that much more difficult for governments to pay their obligations.
Recovery for the stock market, and the wider economy, needs a lot more than an agency to change its mind about government bond ratings.

HEADLINE: Imparting Energy Smarts to Young Consumers

BYLINE: JIM WITKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Concluding that the low-hanging fruit is simply to get people to switch things off, a group creates visually appealing kits for teaching simple conservation messages.

 BODY:
While some members of Congress lament the prospect of switching to energy-efficient light bulbs, one California nonprofit, Zilowatt, is spreading the energy conservation message at a grass-roots level. The group, whose motto is "Start Small," wants to change energy habits by teaching consumers in grades K to 12 that the best light bulb is one that's turned off. 
Zilowatt, based in Palo Alto, has worked with a handful of school districts in the San Francisco Bay Area and will supply interactive educational kits to the Palo Alto schools this fall for an outreach program sponsored by the city's utility department. The hope is the kids will bring these conservation habits home and educate their parents.
Zilowatt was started in 2010 by parents and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who have children in the public school system. They began by considering solar power systems for the schools but were soon daunted by the red tape involved and by shrinking budgets. "It seemed easier to build a new school than put a solar panel on an existing school," said Al Yuen, Zilowatt's managing director.
"We concluded that the low-hanging fruit is to get people to simply turn things off when they're done," Mr. Yuen said, given that studies have shown that this can reduce energy use by 10 to 20 percent in the home.
Zilowatt enlisted volunteer graphic artists to create visually appealing kits for teaching simple conservation precepts. The kits are easy to use and allow students to work at their own pace, Mr. Yuen said. The materials are populated with superheroes like Reuse, Recycle and Reduce and TIO, the mascot for the group's "Turn It Off" theme. 
Although the materials are available for students up to grade 12, Zilowatt has discovered that the older pupils can be less receptive to the message. "It seems that if you don't establish good conservation before third grade, it's an uphill battle," Mr. Yuen said. 
The group's goal is to offer its materials to any school district that is interested, but with two requirements. First, a sponsor must be recruited to pay for the materials so that they are provided at no cost to any school. For the Palo Alto program starting this fall, the city's utility department received a $35,000 grant from the American Public Power Association, a service organization representing community-owned electric utilities, to cover costs. 
Zilowatt also requests that the school find someone like a science teacher to oversee and promote the program. 
"We don't want to ship these and have them sit in the admin's office," Mr. Yuen said. "Since we're not the ones who come and teach these programs, we're looking for local champions who are passionate about conservation to support them."

HEADLINE: Race for Weiner's Seat Tighten, Poll Finds

BYLINE: DAVID W. CHEN


HIGHLIGHT: The race for Mr. Weiner's seat has become much closer with voters most concerned about economic issues, suggesting a preview of next year's national election.

 BODY:
The race to succeed former Representative Anthony D. Weiner is much closer than anticipated, according to the first public poll for the Sept. 13 special election.
According to a Siena Research Institute poll released Wednesday morning, 48 percent of likely voters in the Ninth Congressional District, which straddles Queens and Brooklyn, support the Democratic candidate, Assemblyman David I. Weprin, while 42 percent favor the Republican, Bob Turner, a retired business executive. That gap - which lies just outside the four percentage point margin of sampling error for the poll of 501 likely voters - is smaller than the surprisingly tight 10 percentage point edge that voters gave to Mr. Weiner over Mr. Turner in 2010. 
Mr. Weiner, a seven-term incumbent who had been considered a strong contender in the 2013 mayoral election, resigned from his Congressional seat on June 16 after acknowledging that he had sent sexually explicit online messages to at least six women. Party leaders then chose Mr. Weprin, the scion of a longtime Queens political dynasty, and Mr. Turner, who rode a wave of Tea Party angst to a stronger-than-anticipated defeat in 2010, to face off for the right to serve through the end of 2012. And since the district is strongly Democratic, Mr. Weprin had been pegged as the favorite.
But the race to succeed the fallen Mr. Weiner is not the only reason the race has attracted national attention. As a result of the 2010 census, New York must lose two Congressional seats, and some political observers believe that the Ninth District could be eliminated. So whoever wins Mr. Weiner's seat could have a Congressional career lasting just 475 days.
Moreover, the race has offered both parties a sneak preview, perhaps, of what themes or issues may resonate with voters nationwide in next year's elections. And the poll found that economic issues loom large: 66 percent of likely voters said that jobs and the federal deficit should be the top two priorities of their next congressman. By a two-to-one margin, they said that they supported the recent increase in the nation's debt ceiling, as well as a tax increase for people making more than $250,000 a year, but opposed, by a margin of three to one, cutting entitlements like Medicare and Social Security.
Curiously, though, the poll did not ask voters about the one local issue that political analysts and residents say has dominated the race so far: whether Mr. Weprin, a Modern Orthodox Jew who observes the Sabbath, is the best pro-Israel candidate. After all, former Mayor Edward I. Koch, a staunch defender of Israel who ranked as the most popular political figure in the survey, with a favorable rating of 69 percent, crossed party lines to back Mr. Turner.
Good thing, meanwhile, that Mr. Weiner is not running. Sixty-eight percent of the respondents said that they had an unfavorable view of him, while only 27 percent had the opposite view. That unfavorable mark was the highest of any political figure in the survey, with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg a distant second, with 53 percent unfavorable.

HEADLINE: Asked & Answered | Sean Patrick Maylone

BYLINE: AARON GILBREATH


HIGHLIGHT: Seoul's premier indie booking agent, Sean Patrick Maylone, discusses South Korea's burgeoning underground music scene.

 BODY:
With K-pop groups like the Wonder Girls on the ascent - and sitting front row at the Chloe show in Shanghai - it's clear that Korean pop is having a moment. But is there a Korean underground? According to Sean Patrick Maylone, the answer is yes. His Seoul-based booking and promotion agency, SuperColorSuper, has helped to create a South Korean tour circuit for indie bands like Caribou, Das Racist and CocoRosie, blazing a trail not just to Seoul, but also to Busan and Daegu, places the 30-year-old native Californian knew nothing about when he arrived in Korea to teach English four years ago. Here, Maylone discusses South Korea's burgeoning underground music scene.
Q.
Indie bands have long played Tokyo, Shanghai and Beijing. Why has it taken so long for South Korea to become a tour stop?
A.
That's basically what I asked myself when I first started doing this. There's a lot of money here. People spend it on iPhones and entertainment and gadgets. Getting bands here shouldn't be so hard. I mean, we're right next to Tokyo, which has what seems like 60,000 shows every night. I don't know the cause of the oversight, but all of my work is aimed at trying to correct it.
How is the economics of booking bands changing there?
Now that we're finding the underground community, we can rely on the fact that we can bring in enough fans to cover costs. One limitation for all of Asia has been gear. Some bigger bands need their own gear, and they have to put it on a ship, which can be really expensive. We now have local gear rental and are trying to make all this local source stuff work in order to fix that. That's one reason we are working on a tour network. Doing shows in some small Korean cities helps generate money to pay off the flights to get into Korea. I also work with D.I.Y. promoters in Hong Kong and the Philippines to make these larger Asian tours more financially feasible for the artists.
How receptive are Korean audiences to your shows?
We have a lot of expats who come to the shows, but it's getting more Korean lately. Initially, I think the Korean crowd saw our shows as "foreigner" shows, because these bands have a lot of expat fans. By hosting bands that have a larger Korean fan base, we've grabbed more Koreans' eyes.
What do you see happening in Korea's music world?
I think Korea's coming into what we in America experienced in the 1950s and '60s, socially and artistically, and that we're going to see the rise of more anti-heroes. Something like "Rebel Without a Cause" is going to come out here, or their own hippie movement. Maybe K-pop is going to go through stages like the Beatles did, from straight-up bubblegum to more tripped-out, experimental open-mindedness. It's related to economics. Korea was having problems in the '90s. People were having trouble just putting food on their plates. They had a militant government. Now people have all this money to spend. You have the rise of an artist class, and creative explosions are going to follow. People in various industries are sort of betting on it. Vice magazine has gotten involved with music here. Nylon now does a Korean version. I'm hoping we'll start to feel the development of a Korean signature, a Korean approach to things.
Does SuperColorSuper work with Korean bands? 
Yeah, part of what we do is inform local bands about D.I.Y. touring - how to connect with established bands, drive city to city, live cheaply, sleep at people's houses and build a following. We've also sent some Korean bands to China. One of the projects we're doing now is making these viral art videos to help launch Korean bands so that people outside of Korea can check them out. For Korean underground music to thrive, there has to be circulation: bands going outside of Korea, bands moving between cities in Korea.
What are some Korean bands people should check out?
A noise-pop duo called (((10))), comprised of a girl and a guy that have a sort of early Animal Collective sound. Wagwak, a catchy, Bright Eyes-type indie folk duo. Vidulgi Ooyoo, a shoe-gaze band reminiscent of My Bloody Valentine or Slowdive whose name translates to "Pigeon Milk." Bamseom Pirates, a funny grind-core band who play 30-second songs. A chill-wave band called Googolplex. Yamagata Tweakster is a tongue-in-cheek solo artist who dresses in slacks and a tie and sings and dances with his laptop. There's not a lot of Korean irony, but there are a few bands that have just come out that are using irony pretty well. The band Ninano Nanda combines Korean pansori operatic singing with really '90s techno-beats and Mortal Kombat soundtrack-type sounds.
What are Korean clubs like?
There are these generic halls where you can do your music-award show or whatever. They don't have much of a flavor, no specific design or genre they focus on, which is good because it means many types of people can use them for different events. We use them for bigger acts. Then there are these dirty little rock clubs like the ones back home. There's one called DGBD that's built to look like the inside of CBGB. They bill hard rock and punk. Many of them are in one neighborhood, and that neighborhood's going through a lot of changes.
Is that Hongdae, the university district? 
Yeah, Hongdae. There are a bunch of university neighborhoods, but Hongdae is where all of this stuff is centered. There's also an area called Gangnam where all the head-banger and electronic bands play, but the clubs there charge like $40 to get in. Gangnam is more the high-money dance scene. Hongdae is the live-music scene.
You've played in your own noise pop band, Ssighborgggg, for a number of years. Has being in a touring band made you a better promoter? 
SuperColorSuper puts a lot of thought into everything. We're known for having great art and great posters. I'm all about making a show as artistic and visual an environment as possible. I very carefully control the lighting, sound and decor. I care about the audience's experience. When a band's playing, I'll sometimes go on the lighting mixer and just rock out and fit lights with the song, basically using the principles an artist would use to shape something. To make it stimulating, we're hands-on, because in the end, that's what people come to shows for. You want a good band, but overall, you want an experience.
Seoul is a very new city. Is it lacking the dilapidated infrastructure that often gives great underground venues their character?
That sort of character develops organically. When you think of San Francisco, you picture those hilly streets and Victorian houses. When you think of Mexico City, you think of layers of villas. When you think of Tokyo, you think of "Blade Runner" and layers of neon. Right now we're waiting to see what the archetypical aesthetic of Seoul will be, how it will reveal itself to the world.
An earlier version of this post misstated the name of a night club in Seoul. It is DGBD, not DGBG.

HEADLINE: Big Banks Shrinking as S.B.A. Lenders

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Even as their deposits grow, the biggest banks are making fewer S.B.A. loans.

 BODY:
The Small Business Administration's guaranteed business loan program is back. Nudged by stimulus provisions that reduced fees and increased guarantees, American banks made a record amount of S.B.A.-backed loans in 2010 (measured in dollars), reversing a demoralizing four-year slide. But there's something noteworthy about who was doing that lending: while banks as a whole loaned more government-backed money than ever, the biggest banks loaned less.
The 25 American banks with the most deposits in 2010 underwrote $3.6 billion in S.B.A. general business, or 7(a), loans. That is just more than 20 percent of all 7(a) loans approved that year, down nearly a third from the share these same banks loaned in 2006. The decline cannot be tied to a decline in deposits. In that same period, these banks grew to control $5.8 trillion in deposits, 61 percent of all bank deposits in 2010.
In other words, in 2010 the 25 biggest banks held 32 percent more in deposits than those banks did in 2006 - but approved 30 percent less in S.B.A. loans.* The decline appears to be related to losses the banks suffered when borrowers defaulted on one type of 7(a) loan during the crisis, and perhaps as well to the difficulty large banks have in making profits on smaller loans in general.
Steve Smits, the S.B.A. associate administrator who supervises lending programs, said that one reason big banks lost 7(a) market share was that during the recession, many community banks joined -- or rejoined after a long absence -- the S.B.A. program as a way to keep lending despite their weakened balance sheets. This was possible because S.B.A. loans permit a bank to keep less cash in reserve and can be sold on a secondary market to generate still more cash for the bank. "We definitely saw north of a thousand lending partners use our programs for the first time in years during the depths of the recession, and many of those institutions were the small community banks," Mr. Smits said.
But the big banks didn't just lose share of total S.B.A. lending; their dollar volume fell absolutely as well - 15 percent from 2006. Bank of America, the largest bank and one of the top 7(a) lenders in 2006, saw its loan volume plummet 89 percent by 2010. Loans at PNC Bank and RBS Citizens (which operates as Citizens Bank in the Northeast and Charter One in the Midwest) fell by 82 and 83 percent, respectively. At Capital One, which had moved aggressively into the S.B.A. market only a few years earlier, 7(a) lending has almost completely collapsed: the bank, which approved $228 million worth of 7(a) loans in 2006, green-lighted only $551,000 in 2010.
The figures here (and in the chart below) represent loan amounts approved by either the bank or the S.B.A. - a higher amount than the money actually distributed to borrowers, since some loans are canceled before they are issued. They were compiled by the loan brokerage firm MultiFunding, using deposit data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and loan information from the S.B.A. (which was provided by Coleman Publishing). The loan figures are for calendar years, though the S.B.A. itself tracks its lending by the government's fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30.
"I did expect to find that the big banks currently are making a lot less loans to small businesses than smaller banks are," said Ami Kassar, who is chief executive of MultiFunding. "I didn't expect to find that the big banks commitment had decreased."
The big banks simply are not well suited to make S.B.A loans in particular, or small-business loans in general, said Barry Sloane, chairman and chief executive of Newtek Business Services, a large 7(a) lender that is not a bank. "The larger institutions have a much higher cost structure, and they have a harder time making a million-dollar loan profitable," Mr. Sloane said. "Larger banks, when they lend, want to lend more money, to a larger borrower, and they want to secure a depository arrangement. S.B.A. loans don't necessarily go along with a significant amount of deposits. And they are much more labor-intensive than a conventional loan."
To induce large banks to make S.B.A. loans, the agency developed a 7(a) program especially for them, S.B.A. Express. This program lets lenders use their own application forms and credit-scoring models to make smaller loans, which they can approve themselves, and banks don't have to take any more collateral than their regular loans require. It allows those banks to incorporate government-guaranteed loans seamlessly into their lending operations - borrowers who don't qualify for a bank's conventional loan can automatically be considered for an S.B.A.-backed loan without having to start the paperwork all over again. Because they take on more responsibility for underwriting the loan, the banks must also shoulder more of the risk, in the form of a lower guarantee.
By 2007, S.B.A. Express had grown into an important component of the 7(a) program, constituting almost a quarter of the loan volume and more than two-thirds of the total loan numbers. But big banks put the brakes on S.B.A. Express lending in late 2007, a year before the full-on credit crisis that saw most lending come to a halt. At the time, Mr. Smits's predecessor at the S.B.A. explained that banks were seeing higher defaults than they originally anticipated, so they were raising their credit standards. Since then, many appear to have in fact pulled out of the program. Bank of America, RBS Citizens, and Capital One - the three banks showing the sharpest drop in S.B.A. lending - had all specialized in S.B.A. Express loans. Mr. Sloane and Tony Wilkinson, president of the National Association of Government Guaranteed Lenders, both attribute the decline in big-bank 7(a) lending to big losses in Express lending.
The S.B.A.'s Mr. Smits said he was not able to explain the decline in S.B.A. lending among big banks. "I think you have to look at each lender on its own and see whether they've actually had a drop in activities to small business lending in general, or whether it was just S.B.A. in specific," he said. "You have to look at what their model is, and what their average loan sizes are."
The banks contacted by The Agenda were for the most part reluctant to say much about their S.B.A. lending. All insisted that S.B.A. loans are just one of many ways they provide credit to small businesses and that they are broadly making more credit available to those companies.
Robb Hilson, an executive in Bank of America's Global Commercial Banking division, was the most explicit. "Admittedly, we made mistakes, and we ended up losing a lot of money, even on the S.B.A.-guaranteed portfolio, because we were too aggressive at a time where it was not appropriate," he said. "We were looking at borrowers who at the end of the day unfortunately in too many cases did not have the ability to repay the loan."
Several years ago Bank of America suspended its traditional 7(a) program, with the higher guarantees and additional paperwork, because "we thought it wasn't customer-friendly," said Mr Hilson. Last year the bank reintroduced it, and Mr. Hilson vowed that the bank would rebuild - carefully - its Express program. And he added that Bank of America remained a leading lender in another popular S.B.A. program, which guarantees loans made by nonprofit community development companies that partner with banks.
In an e-mail, a PNC spokesman, Fred Solomon, attributed some of that institution's lending decline in 2009 and 2010 to its efforts to combine with National City Bank, which PNC bought in 2008. But, he added, "other factors do play a role, including our determination not to rely on the S.B.A.'s guarantee when qualifying potential borrowers." A spokesman for Capital One, Steve Schooff, said in an e-mail message, "We are reevaluating our strategy and opportunities in the current environment relative to S.B.A. loans to determine the best approach."
Mr. Kassar, for his part, acknowledged the limitations of his analysis of which banks are supporting small businesses. "I don't think the S.B.A. is the only indicator, or a perfect indicator," he said. Still, he added, "it does seem like a reasonable indicator of Main Street lending."
Not all of the big banks have struggled with S.B.A. lending. Despite the overall downward trend, several actually made more 7(a) loans over this time period. SunTrust posted the biggest growth: through 2008, its 7(a) lending hovered around $34 million. In 2009, it grew to $44 million - and then soared to $155 million in 2010. SunTrust has gone from being purely an Express lender to an S.B.A. "generalist," said Jeff Nager, a SunTrust senior vice president and its S.B.A. Division Executive. "We have made it a focus of the bank."
Mr. Nager acknowledged that SunTrust's S.B.A. lending effort was buoyed by the generous government incentives established by the 2009 Recovery Act. "It didn't change our desire to play or not play, but it stimulated a lot of knowledge in the S.B.A.," he said. "The borrowers and the clients learned a lot more about the S.B.A. in a short amount of time because of the stimulus. It became a more prevalent part of the discussion in the market place."
The stimulus provisions have since expired, but Mr. Nager predicted further growth for S.B.A. lending at his institution.
*Eight of the top 25 deposit-holding banks did not participate in the 7(a) program at all between 2006 and 2010; these banks are chiefly credit card lenders or investment managers.

HIGHLIGHT: Citigroup, Bank of America and other financial stocks, rattled by euro debt fears, lead the United States market lower.

 BODY:
The stock market slid Wednesday morning as fears about Europe's debt crisis flared anew. 
The major market indexes were down more than 2 percent after the first half hour of trading. Again, the financial sector was leading the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lower. 
A surprisingly sharp drop in shares of French banks earlier in the day came amid worries that Europe's debt crisis may be spreading to France. 
In the United States, the big bank stocks were among the leading decliners. Bank of America shares were down 5.6 percent, while Citigroup shares were down 5.5. percent. JPMorgan Chase was down 3 percent. Goldman Sachs was down 3.9 percent and Morgan Stanley, down about 3 percent. 
Wednesday should be a big day for Bank of America: Its chief executive will answer investors' questions at a conference call this afternoon.

HEADLINE: Just a Man of the People. The Rich People.

BYLINE: DIANE CARDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: The actor has not yet begun running for mayor, but he is already saying things that could alienate the great swath of voters who cannot afford expensive neighborhoods.

 BODY:
Alec Baldwin has not yet begun running for mayor, but he is already saying things that could alienate the great swath of voters who cannot afford pricey neighborhoods.
Describing his decision to live on the Upper West Side - one of the city's wealthier neighborhoods - he told The Times that it helped him stay in touch with regular people and that it was "more real" and "seems more middle class" than other neighborhoods and is "not a little kind of jewel-box, privileged pocket of the city."
Some parts of the Upper West Side retain a bit of economic diversity, but Mr. Baldwin - a man with money casting himself as a man of the people, a tendency he shares with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg - is hardly huddling with the masses. He lives at the Eldorado, Art Deco twin towers that loom over Central Park West between 90th and 91st Streets and the blocks of multimillion-dollar town houses to the west.
The building has long been home to the prominent and wealthy, as well as to other celebrities like Tuesday Weld, Michael J. Fox and Faye Dunaway, before her eviction troubles at a rent-stabilized apartment across the park.
Mr. Baldwin has just listed his 3,000-square-foot, four-bedroom apartment on the 22nd floor with Corcoran, according to Curbed. The price tag on his "middle class" abode? $9.5 million.

HEADLINE: Got to Boogie on the Disco 'Round: Studio 54 Radio on SiriusXM

BYLINE: MELENA RYZIK


HIGHLIGHT: A D.J. from Studio 54 will revive the music of that 1970s New York disco club when Studio 54 radio launches on SiriusXM satellite radio on Aug. 15.

 BODY:
Disco may have died, gone undercover or been lying in wait along with other 1970s fixtures like oil crises, economic malaise and wide-legged pants. In any case, it is being recalibrated for SiriusXM, the satellite radio station, which is starting a four-on-the-floor channel called Studio 54 on Aug. 15, the company will announce on Wednesday.
Studio 54 Radio, available on channel 15, will be a round-the-clock broadcast of dance and disco hits, rare remixes and deep cuts, many from the collection of D.J.s and habitues of Studio 54, the era-defining Manhattan club run by Steve Rubell and Ian Schrager.John "Jellybean" Benitez, the producer known for early Madonna songs like "Borderline" and "Holiday," who went from patron to D.J. at Studio 54, will serve as the channel's executive producer.
"People are still dancing to these songs 30 years later," Mr. Benitez, who is firmly in the disco-never-died camp, said by phone Monday from Ft. Lauderdale, where he was preparing for a club gig. The music of the 1970s and early '80s, he added, "still lifts today." Mr. Benitez is soliciting tracks from other D.J.s from the disco era and will open his own vault of tens of thousands of CDs, 45s, 8-tracks and reel-to-reels for the station, relishing the opportunity to play music that has not been heard on the radio before - dance versions of songs that weren't even commercially available at the time.
"None of these songs have music videos, or very few of them, so as soon as you hear the song, it really triggers an emotion rather than a visual," he said, before launching into a nostalgia reverie. "You could be in high school, in college, you could be dancing on a speaker in a nightclub. It touches people in a way that current music doesn't." 
Along with the chance to brush up to Bianca Jagger and Andy Warhol, that was part of the appeal of Studio 54. "It was all emotion," Mr. Benitez said. "It was all about dancing and having fun and being free, and being uninhibited and letting go. Most people went to clubs, they left their troubles at the door and went on the dance floor. It was a very tribal, communal kind of feeling."
The station will milk all the feelings of Studio 54 in its weekly interview program, "The Marc and Myra Show," hosted by Marc Benecke, Studio 54's former doorman, and Myra Scheer, the onetime executive assistant to Rubell, who died in 1989. Their guests will include seemingly everyone who still has a disco-glitz story to tell, from the club's original head of security to its waiters and busboys - no editing allowed.
"It's the only place you'll be able to hear what actually happened there," said Mr. Benitez, 53, who first went to the club in "the summer of '77 - when the Bronx was burning," he recalled.
"I was with another D.J. named Tony Carrasco. We'd come down from the Bronx and we were determined to get in there. It was an eye-opening experience, for sure. You had straight people and gay people, white people, black people, movie stars, sports stars and people from the Bronx and Queens. Everybody was a celebrity there, everybody just looked fabulous."
On their first attempt to get in, Mr. Benitez and Mr. Carrasco waited in line with the plebians. Dressed in "probably the flyest thing I owned at the time," Mr. Benitez said, "I went right up to the front and just looked Steve right in the eye and said, 'you gotta let me in.' And he said, 'who are you with?'"
They got in; within a few years Mr. Benitez was manning the decks inside the club. "As a D.J. at Studio 54, you got to take a lot of risks," he said wistfully. "Those people had to act like they'd been before, so they danced to everything."

HEADLINE: In Iowa, Romney Is Comfortable at the Roundtable

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney criticized President Obama for a planned bus tour amid an "economic crisis," but he declined to directly engage Gov. Rick Perry of Texas.

 BODY:
PELLA, IOWA -- Mitt Romney returned to Iowa Wednesday for the first time since he announced his bid for the Republican presidential nomination, striding into a conference room at the headquarters of Vermeer Manufacturing Company for a business roundtable, saying he was there to listen.
"I come to learn, not just to inform," said Mr. Romney, seated at the head of a square table after going around and greeting all of the local business leaders by name. (They were all sporting name tags).
Mr. Romney asked each the 14 people, largely from family-owned companies and small businesses, to share a little about their work, express their concerns and offer advice for the next president. Mr. Romney peppered them with questions, seeming genuinely interested.
After the roundtable, Mr. Romney used "a quintessential Iowa setting with corn and beans around us" to tout his own business credentials, casting President Obama as his foil. However, he was gentler when pressed to address Rick Perry of Texas since the Texas governor announced his intentions (to announce his intentions) to run for the Republican nomination.
"The president is launching his bus tour," Mr. Romney said, referring to Mr. Obama's scheduled bus tour through Iowa next week. "I think the American people would have preferred having him do the work that he was elected to do, which is go to work and get people back to work."
He later added: "I sure as heck wouldn't be on a bus tour if I was president of the United States."
Mr. Romney then briefly played pundit, offering his own take on the general election.
"Let me make this prediction: He won't carry Iowa in November 2012," Mr. Romney said. "He won't carry Iowa because Iowans will recognize that his presidency has failed. He is not up to the task of leading the country at a time of economic crisis, and that's what we have."
Since announcing his candidacy, Mr. Romney has focused on making the case - as he did to the Pella business leaders Wednesday - that he is the best person to create jobs and get the economy back on track. But when asked directly about Mr. Perry's record of job creation in Texas, Mr. Romney opted against engaging him directly, instead focusing on his own background.
"I think I'm the right guy to be the Republican nominee for president, in part because I spent 25 years in the private sector and I know how the economy works," he said. "He's a fine man and a fine governor and the record of Texas, I think, speaks for itself."
Though Mr. Romney plans to leave Iowa Friday for New Hampshire before the weekend's straw poll, he will spend two days here and participate in the Republican debate Thursday night. Wednesday evening he will attend a Polk County Republicans fund-raiser, and on Thursday, he will visit the Iowa State Fair. There is talk he might put on an apron and help grill up some pork chops (for those who take their meat mid-morning), but no word on whether he'll sample the fair's much buzzed about fried stick of butter - on a stick, natch.

HEADLINE: Ron Paul Declines to Gloat About His Prescient Warnings on Debt

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: A man of little bravado, Mr. Paul tells Iowa voters, "I'm not predicting that I know we can win."

 BODY:
WATERLOO, Iowa -- Ron Paul has none of the bravado of his Republican presidential rivals. At a town hall meeting here on Wednesday afternoon, he spoke for 35 minutes and then promptly apologized.
"Hopefully, I didn't scare you off," Mr. Paul, a congressman from Texas, said with a soft voice and a characteristic shrug.
Not likely.
In his second consecutive run for the Republican nomination, Mr. Paul is better known, better organized and on track for what could be a top-three finish at the Ames straw poll on Saturday.
"I'm not predicting that I know we can win or anything like that," Mr. Paul told a room of about 75 people in this town in northeastern Iowa.
In fact, rival campaigns suggest that they believe that Mr. Paul might win the straw poll, on the strength of his support among libertarians, college students and an increasing number of traditional Republicans who are now beginning to agree with Mr. Paul's longstanding criticism of government spending and the federal debt.
Asked whether he feels a sense of vindication because of the warnings he long preached about a coming debt crisis for the country, he said he wasn't raised to gloat. "I don't think you should be out to toot your own horn," he said.
His son Rand, a freshman senator from Kentucky, disagreed.
"We should do some gloating," said Senator Paul, who is in Iowa campaigning with his father. "The slogan for the campaign should be, 'Ron Paul was right!'"
Attending a Ron Paul event is not that dissimilar to attending a lecture on history and economics. For more than a half-hour, Mr. Paul discussed the history of the gold standard, talked about the Eisenhower election and its impact on the nation's foreign policy, and railed against American involvement in global conflicts.
Throughout, he got applause and expressions of approval.
"Yes sir!" one man yelled out when Mr. Paul insisted that as president he would pull America out of the United Nations.
Asked to respond to Republican voters who might think he can't win in a head-to-head race against President Obama, Mr. Paul dismissed the concern, saying that voters should not fear that a vote for him is a wasted vote.
"Wasting a vote is sometimes voting for somebody that you don't really believe in," he said.

HEADLINE: Hispanic Organizations Give Obama and Congress a C

BYLINE: JULIA PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Leaders of the nation's major Hispanic organizations warned that even the small gains Hispanics have seen are at risk of being erased.

 BODY:
Leaders of the nation's major Hispanic organizations, issuing their first progress report on their priority issues, gave C grades on Wednesday to President Obama and to Congress for their performance over the last two years. But they warned that even the small gains Hispanics have seen are at risk of being erased in negotiations by the bipartisan committee that will recommend ways to reduce the federal deficit.
The progress report was released by the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, which includes N.C.L.R. (also known as the National Council of La Raza), the Hispanic Federation, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and about two dozen other Hispanic organizations. It examined action, or lack of it, on a blueprint of policy recommendations the leadership group published in 2008.

For Latinos, the lack of movement toward an immigration overhaul to give legal status to illegal immigrants overshadowed progress on other issues, Hispanic leaders said.
Immigration is "clearly an area where the president overpromised and underdelivered," said Lillian Rodriguez Lopez, the president of the Hispanic Federation, who is also chairwoman of the leadership coalition. On a conference call Wednesday, she recalled that Mr. Obama had pledged to take up the overhaul bill in his first year in office.
"The amount of enforcement activity by the administration has been a great disappointment to our community," Ms. Rodriguez Lopez said. Authorities have deported nearly 800,000 immigrants in the past two years.
The much-disputed 2010 health care bill contained many measures that benefit Hispanics, the progress report found, including expansion of the Medicaid program, the creation of affordable insurance exchanges, $11 billion for community health clinics and $15 billion for preventive care.
The report also found that Hispanics had been helped by Mr. Obama's stimulus package and by Justice Department efforts to prosecute hate crimes against them.
But Ms. Rodriguez Lopez warned that many programs recorded as advances in the report appeared vulnerable in the upcoming deficit reduction talks. "We feel the Latino community can be significantly hurt, but particularly in the health safety net," she said.
Hispanic leaders praised the House of Representatives, when it was controlled by the Democrats, for passing a bill last year, known as the Dream Act, which would grant legal status to illegal immigrant high school graduates seeking to attend college. With opposition from Republicans, the bill failed in the Senate.
The leaders said they expected the Dream Act and other immigration issues to be a litmus test for Latino voters judging candidates in the presidential race. Latinos could cast crucial votes in states like Colorado, Nevada and Florida.
Immigration "is an American problem," said Carmen Segarra, national policy chairwoman of the Hispanic National Bar Association. "This is not a Republican problem or a Democratic problem."

HEADLINE: The Early Word: The Fed

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
 The Fed spoke Tuesday, promising to hold short-term interest rates near zero through at least the middle of 2013. That was a sign, Binyamin Appelbaum reports, that it has all but written off the chances of the economy doing anything more than plodding along through the end of President Obama's first term in office. Helene Cooper analyzes the political and fiscal choices facing Mr. Obama, who once said that he would rather be a good one-term president than a mediocre two-term president. 

        
Senator Patty Murray of Washington has been appointed co-chairwoman of a powerful new Congressional committee that is supposed to recommend at least $1.5 trillion in additional deficit-reduction measures, Robert Pear reports. Senators Max Baucus of Montana and John Kerry of Massachusetts were also appointed to the panel.

        
Representative Renee Ellmers of North Carolina was willing to promote Speaker John A. Boehner's budget plan when many of her freshman colleagues shunned it. That loyalty, along with her relentless cheer and folksy locution, have made her one of the Republican leadership's greatest freshman allies, and a rising star in the Republican conference she once derided at Tea Party rallies back home, Jennifer Steinhauer reports.

        
Tim Pawlenty is reaching out to religious voters, home-school advocates and opponents of same-sex marriage as part of an urgent try-everything, try-anything strategy that his advisers hope will lead to a better-than-expected showing in the Iowa Straw Poll on Saturday. As he heads into what could be a make-or-break moment for his presidential campaign this weekend, Mr. Pawlenty, who has flagged in polls and fund-raising, is not giving up on the evangelical voters who are often responsible for Republican victories in the state, Michael D. Shear reports.
Around the Web

        
Rick Santorum is forging his own path through the Iowa Straw Poll: Making one-on-one appeals to voters in counties no other candidate has visited. The Santorum campaign believes this strategy will be key to his survival past the weekend, Politico reports.

HEADLINE: Romney's Covert Iowa Campaign

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney will come to Iowa on Wednesday, even as he continues to treat political activity here like an sideshow that he can afford to ignore.

 BODY:
DES MOINES - Mitt Romney will dip his big toe in the Iowa waters on Wednesday, even as he continues to treat the political activity here like a sideshow that he can afford to ignore, at least for now.
The front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination will hold a business roundtable in Pella in the afternoon and then attend a barbecue fund-raiser for the local party. On Thursday, he'll stop in at the Iowa State Fair before attending a nationally televised debate at the campus of Iowa State University.
But just as quickly as he arrived, he will leave again, skipping Saturday's straw poll in Ames that his rivals are treating as a crucial test of organization and a measure of the intensity of their support.
Mr. Romney - who in 2007 spent months and many millions of dollars in Iowa - has settled on a strategy that keeps him out of the Republican fray and focused like a laser on President Obama. He has yet to run a television commercial here and has spent more time in New Hampshire, which will hold its first-in-the-nation primary a week after the Iowa caucuses early next year. 
But his top advisers insist that Mr. Romney has not given up on Iowa and is running what amounts to a covert campaign, quietly organizing his supporters in the state and keeping open the option of making a serious run at winning the Iowa caucuses next year.
With a small paid staff, Mr. Romney is mostly relying on volunteers to maintain the important relationships with former supporters, activists, state lawmakers and other important Republicans. 
"Mitt Romney will be in Iowa enough to demonstrate that he's the best candidate to beat Obama on jobs and the economy," said a spokeswoman, Andrea Saul.
Political activists in the state are keeping a close eye on the former governor from Massachusetts.
"The thing that's up for grabs is how much residual support does Mitt Romney still have from four years ago," said Bob Vander Plaats, a former Republican candidate for governor in Iowa and one of the state's social conservative leaders. "There's still quite a bit out here if you talk to people."
There's also a fair amount of skepticism, especially among conservative voters who did not connect with Mr. Romney in his previous presidential campaign. Some voters remain put off by what they see as his moderate positions from the past on issues like health care and abortion. 
"I'm not for Mr. Romney. I don't believe he's a true conservative," said John Scheppler, 53, a small business owner in Ames who attended a breakfast gathering to see Rick Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania who is also running for president.
Sentiments like that helped convince Mr. Romney's strategists not to participate in the coming straw poll. But going forward, the question for Mr. Romney is whether a decision to invest time and money in Iowa could change minds and produce a different result in the caucuses.
In 2008, after spending $10 million in the state, Mr. Romney came in a disappointing second place, behind Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas. In 2012, Mr. Romney could find himself losing again, this time to Michele Bachmann, Tim Pawlenty or Rick Perry if he gets into the race.
Aides say the challenge for Mr. Romney is to manage expectations against investments. The more time and money he spends in Iowa, the better people will expect him to do. But if he makes too little an effort, his chances for proclaiming a better-than-expected showing go down.
In some ways, Mr. Romney is trying to implement a modified version of the strategy that a senior aide to Hillary Rodham Clinton suggested for the then-frontrunner in the 2008 Democratic nomination contest.
Mike Henry, the deputy campaign manager for Mrs. Clinton, wrote in May 2007 that she should "pull completely out of Iowa and spend the money and Senator Clinton's time on other states."
Mr. Henry's theory was similar to Mr. Romney's. He argued that a full-blown Iowa campaign would require $15 million and more than 75 days of Ms. Clinton's time in the state. And he said the results on caucus day were "likely to be inconclusive" for the Democratic contenders.
"Worst case scenario: this effort may bankrupt the campaign and provide little if any political advantage," Mr. Henry wrote.
Mrs. Clinton did not take Mr. Henry's advice. His memo was leaked to the press and she publicly disavowed it. She went on to lose the Iowa caucuses to Mr. Obama after spending millions of dollars in the state.
In Mr. Romney's case, he has not talked about pulling out completely, in part to avoid the kind of reaction from Iowa loyalists that Mrs. Clinton received when the memo became public.
It is also important for Mr. Romney to keep the general election in mind, should he win the nomination and have to run against Mr. Obama. Iowa is an important state for a Republican nominee to win, and Mr. Obama has a good track record in the state. The president handily won Iowa's seven electoral votes in 2008.
Mr. Romney's Iowa strategy will become clearer after Labor Day and into the fall.
But for now, Mr. Romney is content to let Mr. Pawlenty, Mrs. Bachmann and the others duke it out ahead of Saturday's nonbinding straw poll. 
If it weren't for the televised debate on Thursday - and maybe the fried Oreo cookies at the Iowa State Fair - Mr. Romney might not be here at all.

HEADLINE: Where Will Growth Come From? Developing countries can help, but the big burden falls on the industrialized nations

 BODY:
Never has the world economy depended so much on the success of developing nations. A misguided focus on budget cutting has plunged the European Union and the United States down paths that will prolong their economic stagnation and perhaps tip them into another recession. The International Monetary Fund was forecasting 2 percent growth in the euro zone before the financial crisis spread to Italy. The Japanese economy is shrinking. Some top economists put the odds of a double-dip recession in the United States at 1 in 2. 
These dire prospects, along with the realization that economic policy is blocked by political gridlock in the United States and complacency in Europe, have sent spasms through financial markets, which could further sap growth. Fortunately, developing countries, which account for almost half the globe's economic output, are growing faster than the industrialized world: in June the I.M.F. forecast that they would grow some 6.5 percent this year and next. Their growth spares the world utter economic stagnation.
Yet developing countries are not robust enough to keep the global economy from sinking in a morass for long. Their economies remain vulnerable to financial turbulence and economic weakness in wealthy nations.
Even a flood of money moving to developing nations, as investors react to the lack of growth in the industrial world, would create new challenges. It would stoke inflation and asset bubbles in developing economies: annual inflation in Brazil is running at 6.85 percent. And it would push up the value of their currencies, hindering exports.
China, the biggest developing economy, is still more a caboose than a growth engine, dependent on rich countries to buy more than 40 percent of its exports. In 2009, China led efforts to help the global recovery, investing heavily in infrastructure and boosting consumer spending, but today it is taking the opposite tack and trying to combat inflation, which is running at 6.4 percent.
To keep its goods cheap, it has allowed its currency to rise only about 6 percent against the dollar since June 2010, even as the dollar has plunged against other currencies. Last month, the I.M.F. called on China to help global growth by letting the currency appreciate more rapidly, which would make Chinese goods more expensive around the world and give a break to competing manufacturers.
China has so far resisted that advice. It lashed out at economic mismanagement in Washington after the Standard & Poor's downgrade, which could potentially reduce the value of its $1.1 trillion stash of American Treasury bonds. Rather than berate Washington, it should abandon its currency manipulation. China's leaders have said they want to put more money in the hands of consumers through social programs and higher wages, and to rely less on exports. They can do this without stoking inflation by allowing the renminbi to rise significantly.
The burden of global growth cannot be placed on China alone. Germany has the third-largest trade surplus in the world, after China and Japan, sapping growth in its European neighbors. The United States and the European Union must focus more on spurring economic growth. They should have all along.

HEADLINE: Cameron's Broken Windows

BYLINE: By RICHARD SENNETT and SASKIA SASSEN. 
Richard Sennett is a professor of sociology at the London School of Economics and New York University. Saskia Sassen is a professor of sociology at Columbia.

 BODY:
OUR son lives next to a Turkish mosque on Kingsland Road in Hackney, where some of London's worst mob violence has occurred. When looters rampaged through Hackney last weekend, there were few police officers to stop them and residents had to chase them off with butcher knives, truncheons and baseball bats. Vigilante action succeeded where normal policing failed.
Kingsland Road resembles the bustling, ethnically mixed streets of Brooklyn. During the day, it is a home of sorts for unemployed young men with nothing to do; Britain's youth unemployment rate is currently over 20 percent. During the economic boom a decade ago, though, nearly as many were out of work, and they did not all turn to crime. 
To counter the risk that they might, there were storefront drop-in centers for young people in the neighborhood; these places are now shutting down, as are other community services, like health centers for the elderly and libraries. Local police forces have also been shrinking.
All are victims of what people in Britain call ''the cuts'' -- the government's defunding of civil-society institutions in order to balance the nation's books. Before the riots, the government had planned to cut 16,200 police officers across the country. In London, austerity means that there will be about 19 percent less to spend next year on government programs, and the burden will fall particularly on the poor.
The rioters in London appear to be young men of varying races -- despite reports of a monolithic mob of alienated ''black youth.'' But there is a racial dimension to this drama. The wave of riots began with protests against the police killing of a young black man, Mark Duggan. While initially peaceful, the demonstrations soon descended into violence. When the unrest spread to Manchester on Tuesday, many of the rioters there were apparently white.
An old-fashioned Marxist might imagine that the broken windows and burning houses expressed a raging political reaction to government spending cuts -- but this time that explanation would be too facile.
The last time Britain saw widespread rioting, in the 1980s, street violence came after a long and failed political struggle against the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher, which suppressed trade unions and decimated social services. Today, the rioters seem motivated by a more diffuse anger, behaving like crazed shoppers on a spree; while some of the shops looted are big chains, many more are small local businesses run by people who are themselves struggling through Britain's economic slump.
There has been a change in national temperament that has affected decent citizens as well as criminals. The country's mood has turned sour. Indeed, the flip side of Britons' famed politeness is the sort of hooliganism that appears at soccer matches and in town centers on weekend nights -- an unfocused hostility that is usually fueled by vast quantities of alcohol. Fears of anarchic urban mobs date from Shakespeare's time, and Prime Minister David Cameron has summoned these old fears, describing the present conflagration as ''senseless.''
Mr. Cameron was good at selling people on the idea of cutting costs, but he has failed to make the case for what and how to cut: efforts to increase university fees, to overhaul the National Health Service, to reduce the military and the police, even to sell off the nation's forests, have all backfired, with the government hedging or simply abandoning its plans.
In attempting to carry out reform, the government appears incompetent; it has lost legitimacy. This has prompted some people living on Kingsland Road to become vigilantes. ''We have to do things for ourselves,'' a 16-year-old in Hackney told The Guardian, convinced that the authorities did not care about, or know how to protect, communities like his.
A street of shuttered shops, locked playgrounds and closed clinics, a street patrolled by citizens armed with knives and bats, is not a place to build a life.
Americans ought to ponder this aspect of Britain's trauma. After all, London is one of the world's wealthiest cities, but large sections of it are impoverished. New York is not so different.
The American right today is obsessed with cutting government spending. In many ways, Mr. Cameron's austerity program is the Tea Party's dream come true. But Britain is now grappling with the consequences of those cuts, which have led to the neglect and exclusion of many vulnerable, disaffected young people who are acting out violently and irresponsibly -- driven by rage rather than an explicit political agenda.
America is in many ways different from Britain, but the two countries today are alike in their extremes of inequality, and in the desire of many politicians to solve economic and social ills by reducing the power of the state.
Britain's current crisis should cause us to reflect on the fact that a smaller government can actually increase communal fear and diminish our quality of life. Is that a fate America wishes upon itself?

HEADLINE: Wisconsin's Warning to Union-Busters: Republicans paid a price for their anti-union law, even if Democrats had hoped for more

 BODY:
Five months after Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin pushed through a law stripping public unions of their bargaining rights, the Republican Party has paid a price. Two of the state senators who backed the law were thrown out of office by voters on Tuesday and replaced with Democrats. Mr. Walker's opponents did not succeed in turning over the Senate, but it was still an impressive response to the governor's arrogant overreach. 
Recall elections are extremely difficult to win; only two had succeeded in the state in the last 80 years. The districts lean Republican, and getting people to turn out in an unusual off-year election is always a struggle. Had Democrats won one more district, they would control the Senate, but they were also trying to send a warning to Republican lawmakers around the country who are trying to break public employee unions. In that, they succeeded.
Republicans will not admit this, but the numbers showed significant strength for Democrats even in the districts they lost -- strength that could grow if lawmakers continue cutting spending and taxes while reducing the negotiating rights of working families. In one rural senatorial district that had not elected a Democrat in a century, the Democratic candidate reached 48 percent of the vote. Another race was also close, and as Nate Silver noted in The Times, the overall results suggest that a contemplated statewide recall of Mr. Walker himself would be too close to call. (Two Democrats face recalls next week.)
Mr. Walker and his colleagues tried to paint the unions as unwilling to sacrifice a bit of their pensions and health benefits in rough fiscal times. It was heartening to see more than 160,000 Wisconsin voters reject that false notion. The unions had already agreed to significant concessions on both; what the Republicans really wanted was to break their organizing ability by ending bargaining on anything except wages and limiting raises to inflation.
The measure they enacted, which would block withholding of union dues from state employees' paychecks, was aimed solely at labor's political power and had nothing to do with the state budget. But Tuesday's vote proved that the unions and the middle-class voters who support them remain a potent force.
It was probably a stretch for union supporters to go after six incumbent senators, rather than concentrate their forces on the most vulnerable. Nonetheless, voters around the country who oppose the widespread efforts to undermine public unions -- largely financed by corporate interests -- should draw strength from Tuesday's success, not discouragement.

HEADLINE: Nervously Watching As the Economy Churns

BYLINE: By ROBB MANDELBAUM; Darren Dahl and Adriana Gardella contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Wall Street, we know, is roiling. The extraordinary events of the last two weeks -- the brinksmanship in Washington over raising the federal debt limit, the downgrade of the government's credit rating by Standard & Poor's, and the debt trouble across the Atlantic in Europe -- have pummeled stocks and dizzied traders.
But how has Main Street reacted to all of this and to renewed talk of a double-dip recession? The New York Times asked small-business owners around the country whether they were feeling the effects of the economic turmoil and whether they were still trying to build -- or just to hang on.
Here are their comments, which have been condensed. 
TOM HOEBBEL, photographer and videographer; Ithaca, N.Y. ''Most people are not hiring professional photographers and video producers with their stock dividends, but the psychological impact affects how people view their current budgets. If we are headed to another recession, then nearly everyone will be closing their wallets and cutting projects. I fear that that would lead to one more person -- me -- entering the statistics of the unemployed.''
JACK STACK, chief executive of SRC Holdings, which makes racecar engines, home furnishings and many other products; Springfield, Mo. ''We're making moves trying to figure out what the policy makers are doing rather than based on what we should be doing for our customers. Are they going to extend the tax cuts or not? Are they going to implement changes in the estate tax or not? How will changes in health care affect capital gains? I mortgaged plants and put $11 million in the bank, paying 5 percent interest, as an insurance policy because I don't know if there is going to be another credit crisis. I need to add another building, but I don't know if I should lease it or buy it. I've also been staying up all night watching what's going on in the Asian and U.K. markets, trying to figure out what it's going to mean. Given what has happened over the past eight days, you can predict that consumer spending will be affected. All this despite the fact that we still have record profits.''
ELIZABETH LUNNEY, co-founder and chief executive, ABC Language Exchange, which offers group and private language lessons; New York. ''I'm looking at my numbers every single day and going through the list figuring out what I'd get rid of first. So far, we're having our best year ever, but if I see that sales start to drop 10 to 15 percent in a week and see that it's a trend over the next two or three weeks, I'll start cutting. The water cooler, and other extras like employee lunches, will be the first to go. After that, I'll consider asking the staff to take pay cuts, which I prefer to layoffs. Last time, I was the first to take a pay cut. I brought my salary down to what I needed to pay rent and eat bologna.''
BILL LAMPSON, president of Lampson International, which builds and rents heavy-lift construction cranes; Kennewick, Wash. ''We've sold a couple of big machines that we manufacture to the Chinese, for their nuclear program, and we're presently constructing a very large machine for the Japanese for their nuclear program. But here in the United States, business has of course been down for essentially the last three years, since the late fall of 2008. We serve the general construction industry that builds nuclear power plants, bridges, stadiums. When those major projects are not going forward, there's very little demand for our equipment. There's just not a lot of confidence in the economy, and that, coupled with the regulatory program that's going on and the taxes that corporations are charged at, makes it less attractive to make investments. People that have money, such as the oil companies and the mining companies and utility companies, they're hesitant to invest in major projects.''
ELIZABETH CHARNOCK, founder of Cataphora, which makes software that analyzes Internet activity; Redwood Shores, Calif. ''As economic news worsens, a small business tends to get paid later and later, if at all. I've learned that when the going gets tough, you've got to stand up for yourself and show that you're the least likely person to be bullied -- not the most, even if you're wearing a pretty dress. We took two steps. First, we hired an ex-Army Ranger who had served in Iraq to chase down receivables -- he's got a finance degree, too. The second thing we did was let it be known that we'll fight over a $100 invoice. We'll call up and ask, 'is there a reason this hasn't been paid?' In this economy, you have to get your teeth out and fight.''
JASON HOLSTINE, owner of Amicus Green Building Center, which sells environmentally friendly home improvement products; Kensington, Md. ''We've had three of our best months ever this calendar year, but we've also had three dismal months. We've had growth plans on the shelf since 2008 and, based on our strong months, were just looking to dust them off. I think we had just reached a point where people were feeling optimistic again. Now comes the double-dip and all the apprehension that comes with it.''
GUS MANCY, co-owner of Mancy's Restaurant Group, which owns four restaurants; Toledo, Ohio. ''I'm being real proactive with our financial management. We've continued to accelerate debt payments through the recession, but I just hung up with my banker, and we're meeting tomorrow morning to look at reducing these interest rates now that we're seeing a dip in interest rates. We're just starting a catering company -- there are some other catering operations that have gone under, and we feel there's a void in the market -- but we're doing it in a very slow-growth mode, versus going out and having a catering facility. In the past, we would have probably purchased an existing building and converted it; you know, we would've gone out and probably borrowed a million or two million dollars.''
BOB SAHADI, co-owner of Sahadi's, which sells imported specialty foods wholesale and retail; Brooklyn. ''People coming in are obviously more worried about their money disappearing, they're much more careful when they're buying. But on the good side of it, we're an ingredient store. So if people are trying to save, they're not going to go to restaurants perhaps as much. We own the store next door, which is vacant right now. We are trying to expand the store to include that store, which is a rather expensive venture. We're trying to keep up with the people like the Trader Joe's and the Fairways, which means we need a little more room. I don't know that if I were a new business, I would consider doing something like this -- I'm sure I wouldn't.''
LEW PRINCE, owner of Vintage Vinyl, which buys and sells used records and CDs; St. Louis. ''It's sad because I'm seeing customers I have known for 30 years literally cleaning things out to make ends meet. I had one guy bring in a suitcase full of jazz records that belonged to his mother who told me he needed the money to make his car payment. The folks in Washington don't know what effect their stupidity has on people. It's a horror.''
THOM DAVIS, chief information officer and co-owner of Omega Environmental Technologies, which sells auto air-conditioning parts for the aftermarket; Irving, Tex. ''Our business is phenomenal. We're working on our 39th plus-100-degree day in a row here in Dallas. Our sales end up with people who need their car fixed, and people aren't willing to wait. When it's 105 outside, you're not rolling down your windows.''

HEADLINE: In Britain, Central Bank Cuts Outlook On Growth

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON -- The governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn A. King, gave a gloomy outlook for the British economy on Wednesday but said he would not make a vow like the one by the Federal Reserve in the United States to keep short-term interest rates near zero for some time.
Mr. King said higher inflation and a deterioration of the British economy had squeezed households' finances more than expected. The central bank cut its economic growth forecast for this year to 1.4 percent, from 1.8 percent. Britain's economy barely grew in the second quarter, and interest rates have been at a record low of 0.5 percent since March 2009. 
''The mood in markets has taken a sharp turn for the worse,'' Mr. King said in a speech after the publication of the bank's inflation report.
''Headwinds are becoming stronger by the day,'' he said. ''The weakness in underlying activity is likely to be somewhat more persistent than previously expected.''
Mr. King attributed the deterioration of the economy to problems faced by some countries that share the euro in repaying their debt, and to the outlook for growth and fiscal policy in the United States.
Some economists said the central bank's new growth forecast was still too optimistic, arguing that an austerity program that freezes public sector pay and pensions and cuts some social benefits would slow down a recovery even more.
Teodor Todorov, an economist at the Center for Economics and Business Research in London, said the worsening economic situation may lead the central bank to consider resuming its bond purchasing program, so-called quantitative easing, to increase the supply of money in circulation.
He said the central bank would be pushed to act as the government's public spending cuts began in earnest, consumer demand remained weak and worries circulated concerning Britain's two largest trading partners, the United States and Continental Europe.
''It is likely that pressure will build on the Bank of England to resume its quantitative easing program in order to stimulate a recovery that is quickly losing its legs,'' Mr. Todorov said.
A deteriorating labor market and a slow economic recovery in the United States prompted the Fed on Tuesday to make a rare promise to hold short-term interest rates near zero through at least mid-2013. The step showed that the Fed, too, saw little prospect of rapid economic improvement.
Mr. King said Wednesday that he saw no reason for a similar step by the Bank of England because it was ''dangerous to make a commitment'' on interest rates. It was ''not very sensible'' because the economic and market circumstances could change very quickly, he said. Emphasizing just how unpredictable global markets and economies were at this moment, he said, ''Who knows how the conditions would be next month, let alone in one or two years?''
But the governor hinted that the central bank was unlikely to increase interest rates anytime soon. Mr. King said there was little the Bank of England could do to bring down inflation, which reached 4.2 percent in June, because the increase was mainly because of higher oil and commodity prices. He reiterated an earlier forecast for 5 percent inflation in the short term, before falling ''quite sharply next year.''
The European Central Bank was criticized by some economists for raising interest rates too soon in an attempt to stem inflation. The July rate rise in part led the bank to later buy Spanish and Italian sovereign debt to prevent the European debt crisis from deepening.
Mr. King emphasized that the challenges facing the British economy were ''global challenges.''
''The outlook for growth in the world economy has deteriorated,'' he said, ''and, largely as a consequence, near-term growth prospects at home are somewhat weaker.''

HEADLINE: The U.S. Dollar Is Still The Top Choice

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and ANTONY CURRIE

 BODY:
It will take more than a debt downgrade and two years of ultra-low interest rates to knock the dollar from its perch as the world's reserve currency. Despite multiple setbacks, the dollar remains the lingua franca of global commerce and the currency of choice for foreign central banks.
The Federal Reserve's commitment to keep interest rates exceptionally low until mid-2013 is bound to start another storm of international protest, and with good reason. Low rates make dollars much less appealing to hold and drives investors to alternatives like the Swiss franc and the Japanese yen. 
When combined with the decision by Standard & Poor's to strip America of its AAA rating, the dollar should arguably be taking a bigger hit. The dollar index, which measures the dollar's value against several other currencies, is at a depressed 74.7, but still well above the 71.3 it hit in early 2008.
A big reason is that a strong dollar remains in the world's best interest. Even though it has lost more than a third of its value in the last decade, global savers have filled their central bank mattresses with the stuff. According to the International Monetary Fund, 61 percent of the world's $5.3 trillion allocated currency reserves are in dollars, little changed from the previous two years. New purchases in the first quarter overwhelmingly favored the dollar, as some central banks bought it to check the appreciation of their own currencies.
Reserve currency reigns do not end overnight. The previous champ, sterling, ceded its title over a period of decades. This time around, there is still no other currency that could take the dollar's place. The euro, once the leading contender, is under siege, while the Chinese renminbi is still pegged to the dollar. Plans to create a reserve currency basket have not gained much traction.
Still, recent actions have clearly hurt the dollar more. And it is the bleeding from a thousand cuts, both inevitable and self-inflicted, that will eventually cost the dollar its dominance.
Struggling Banks
Fears that American banks may need more capital have contributed to the market's decline this week. While most institutions have far better defenses against a recession than they did four years ago, that does not necessarily mean they are cheap enough to buy.
Regulation, low interest rates and economic woes have made it tough for banks to earn more than their cost of capital. Even if the market does not have another credit crisis like the one in 2008, the Federal Reserve's decision to keep rates low for another two years could still extend the pain.
First, the Fed's move means that interest income on loans will be lower. In theory, that should be offset by cheaper borrowing costs for banks. But concerns about a downturn nudged up borrowing costs even before the turmoil of recent days. And a recession -- even just the fear of one -- may well crimp the supply and demand for loans.
Ultra-low rates also mean slim returns on portfolios of securities, most of which have an average maturity of around four years, according to Nomura. Since shorter-duration assets are in high demand, their yield curve is flattening, too, and will not bring much juice.
Stronger balance sheets also have an effect. Bank of America has almost twice the capital it had going into the crisis in 2008, along with $400 billion in cash. That is necessary insurance, but it hurts returns. The lack of clarity about the new regulations still has many scratching their heads.
Many of these factors were figured into earnings estimates. Citigroup, for example, was expected to bring in $6.13 a share in 2013, according to Thomson Reuters data. Put that on a multiple of seven times earnings, and Citi should be worth $43 a share. That is still less than the bank's current book and tangible book values. But after Wednesday's sell-off, investors appear to be pricing shares a third lower than that anemic price.
It is a similar story at JPMorgan Chase, which trades at a fifth lower than estimates. Bank of America, meanwhile, has flopped to just over half of 2013 expectations. Throw in the fear of further systemic shocks like the European debt crisis, and bank stocks look too volatile. The confidence needed for a broad rally is a way off yet.

HEADLINE: Challenging Census, City Says 50,000 Were Missed

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Invoking the Census Bureau's own data and other evidence, New York City officials argued on Wednesday that the 2010 count had overlooked at least 50,000 residents of Brooklyn and Queens living in homes and apartments that the bureau incorrectly concluded were vacant.
If they had been counted, they would have pushed the city's official population to more than 8.2 million, the Bloomberg administration said in submitting its formal challenge to the Census Bureau. 
Though the city maintains that the bureau committed counting errors across the city, its challenge focuses on four neighborhoods, Astoria and Jackson Heights in Queens and Bay Ridge and Bensonhurst in Brooklyn, which the Bloomberg administration described as among New York's most vibrant and where it said the undercount was the greatest.
The population count released by the Census Bureau in March said that the city had grown by 166,855 people, to 8,175,133, since 2000 -- a rate of 2.1 percent, compared with 9.4 percent during the 1990s. City demographers maintain that while the recession and the aftermath of 9/11 slowed growth in the last decade, New York is now home to at least 8.3 million people.
While any adjustment would come too late to affect the reapportionment of Congressional districts based on the official census count, more than bragging rights are at stake. A higher count could mean more federal aid in categories apportioned by population and a bigger base from which subsequent annual population estimates issued by the Census Bureau are computed until the next census in 2020.
''I recognize that enumerating the population of New York City is a Herculean and unenviable challenge, given the city's large, diverse and dense population, which lives primarily in difficult to count housing arrangements,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a letter to Robert M. Groves, the director of the Census Bureau.
But armed with detailed evidence from demographers in the city's Planning Department, the mayor insisted that local census workers responsible for Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Astoria and Jackson Heights had ''erroneously classified large numbers of housing units as vacant.''
''Numerous data sources cited in our submission refute the prevalence of widespread vacant housing units in those areas, which are and continue to be among our most stable, growing and vibrant neighborhoods,'' Mr. Bloomberg wrote. ''This disproportionate concentration of vacancy suggests that some aspect of the census enumeration went awry in these two offices, with likely processing errors that may have hindered the proper reporting, compilation, and tabulation of census results.''
The city unsuccessfully filed a formal challenge to the census count in 1990. Five years ago, city demographers persuaded the Census Bureau to raise its July 1, 2005, estimate by 160,000 -- including 64,000 found by the Planning Department -- to 8.2 million. The 2009 American Community Survey from the Census Bureau placed the population estimate at 8,391,881.
The census's official 2010 count also seemed curious because while it found 166,000 more New Yorkers than in 2000, the number of homes and apartments in the city had increased since then by 170,000.
''Immediately, you're suspicious,'' said Joseph J. Salvo, director of the population division at the Planning Department.
By the official count, the population of Queens rose by only 1,343, or 0.1 percent, from 2000 to 2010; Brooklyn's rose by 39,374, or 1.6 percent. Vacancies soared by 214 percent in southern Brooklyn and by 174 percent in northwestern Queens, well above the citywide average. City officials concluded that neither the bureau's earlier American Community Survey nor its separate Housing and Vacancy Survey supported the 2010 count. Nor did the pace of new construction and foreclosures, and nor did average rents, which should have declined if more apartments were vacant.
The city's claim of an undercount will be examined at the Census Bureau headquarters and could take months to resolve. If the claim is rejected, said Marc LaVorgna, a mayoral spokesman, all options, including legal action, ''remain on the table.''
Since June, 48 localities have filed challenges under the bureau's Count Question Resolution Program, which considers questions of misplaced boundaries and, in the case of New York City's complaint, of coverage where housing units were excluded because of processing errors. Only one count has been adjusted so far, in Maharishi Vedic City, a community in southeastern Iowa founded by followers of the Transcendental Meditation movement, where the count was increased from 259 people to 1,294 to reflect misplaced housing.

HEADLINE: Middle Class? At $9.5 Million, Actor's Home Is Far From It

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
The actor Alec Baldwin has not yet begun running for mayor of New York, but he is already saying things that could alienate the great number of voters who cannot afford expensive neighborhoods. 
Describing his decision to live on the Upper West Side, one of the city's wealthier neighborhoods, Mr. Baldwin said in an interview this week with The New York Times that it helped him stay in touch with regular people and that it was ''more real'' and ''seems more middle class'' than other neighborhoods and is ''not a little kind of jewel-box, privileged pocket of the city.''
Some parts of the Upper West Side retain a bit of economic diversity, but Mr. Baldwin, a 53-year-old Long Island native, is hardly huddling with the masses. He lives at the Eldorado, Art Deco twin towers that loom over Central Park West between 90th and 91st Streets and the blocks of multimillion-dollar town houses to the west.
The building has long been home to the prominent and wealthy, as well as to other celebrities like Tuesday Weld, Michael J. Fox and Faye Dunaway, before her eviction troubles at a rent-stabilized apartment across the park.
Mr. Baldwin has just listed his 3,000-square-foot, three-bedroom apartment on the 22nd floor with Corcoran, according to Curbed. The asking price for his foothold among the middle class? It is $9.5 million.
In the interview, Mr. Baldwin, who appears on the television program ''30 Rock,'' discussed his long-term political ambitions. He said he would probably sit out the 2013 mayoral race but run in a later election, after first learning about the job.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

 BODY:
In early 2010, top officials at the Federal Reserve began to wonder: how would United States banks hold up through the European debt crisis? Investors were fleeing Greece and Ireland, and starting to get nervous about Portugal and Spain, spreading contagion.
The conclusion from the stress tests that resulted was heartening to supervisors at the regulator, according to a person who was directly involved in the exercise: American banks didn't have too much exposure to Portugal and Spain, so the contagion would not be a problem. 
Unless it hit Italy.
''At the time, the results made us a bit relieved; our focus was on Ireland and Greece,'' said this person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the Fed has a policy of not discussing supervisory actions. ''But if Italy goes, God help us all.''
American banks not only had a small exposure to Italian government bonds, but also a larger one to Italian banks and companies. If the European debt crisis spread to Italy, it could cause another global financial catastrophe. Only this time, global regulators might have fewer weapons to combat it. The Fed declined to comment on its analysis.
And that is why last week was so terrifying, scarier than either the stock market drop or the Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States credit rating: debtholders had abandoned Spain and Italy.
At one point on Friday, Italian bonds were trading at more than 400 basis points higher than Germany's, a signal of panic. Italy has a huge debt load. If investors began to focus on that, it wasn't clear what might stop the run.
The European Central Bank intervened this week, buying Spanish and Italian government bonds. On Monday, the panic eased in Europe, with Italian and Spanish interest rates falling. The French and Germans announced that the European Financial Stability Facility (clearly named by Dr. Seuss) would be able to buy those government bonds when it was up and running in late September.
By Wednesday, the fears were back, as French banks got hit especially hard. The problem is that Europe has tried repeatedly to fence off the problem, only to have it escape again to wreak havoc. Greece and Ireland have each been through several rounds of failed bailouts and extensions. If they are bankrupt, and not simply victims of investor panic, then someone, somewhere will have to take losses. And if Spain and Italy start to go down, those losses threaten the global economy.
European banks are on the front lines, vulnerable because they are more thinly capitalized than their American counterparts. Europe has conducted stress tests, just as the Fed has, but they haven't instilled confidence, in part because they didn't subject most sovereign debt holdings to any loss estimates.
The tests did require vast disclosures, however, so that investors and analysts could delve into the numbers and conduct their own analyses.
If European banks go down, what will happen to American banks? Investors and analysts seem unconcerned. American banks disclose some of their exposure to specific countries, but the information isn't up to date and the figures depend on opaque estimates of how well hedged the banks are. Analysts differ on the amounts at risk.
According to a note from the research firm CLSA on July 13, Citigroup had $12.7 billion in Italian holdings, much of it government-related, while JPMorgan Chase had $12.2 billion. According to a note from Bernstein Research, JPMorgan had ''less than $20 billion'' in exposure to Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain combined. But that was going in the wrong direction, up from ''less than $15 billion'' at the end of 2010, when one might expect the banks to be paring exposure.
These aren't large numbers, less than 1 percent of these gigantic banks' balance sheets. And banks wouldn't take 100 percent losses on their investments in the event of a default.
Unfortunately, we simply don't know whether the analysts are right. Neither the Fed nor the Securities and Exchange Commission has forced United States banks to make as detailed disclosures as the European stress tests did of its banks. So it's a matter of having to trust the banks and the regulators.
Which brings us back to the exercise the Fed undertook last year. Two Fed officials ordered up the analysis: Daniel K. Tarullo, the board member who oversees matters of bank supervision, and Patrick Parkinson, the head of banking supervision, who is reported to have undergone a conversion from a Alan Greenspan antiregulation acolyte to a believer in strong oversight. Clinton D. Lively, a number-cruncher who recently left the New York Fed, was one of the officials who played a major role.
Disturbingly, before the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed, which is the most important bank regulator and is charged with keeping the banking system safe and sound, couldn't really do this kind of analysis, according to former Fed officials. It might have asked banks for the data on their exposures to specific countries, but it couldn't play out a chain of events very easily. What if the central bank wanted to know what would happen to United States banks if the euro fell 20 percent in a short period? The Fed didn't have the tools.
Now it does, thanks in part to the efforts of Mr. Lively and others. The assessment came with its own pitfalls. At time the Fed was gathering the data, a rumor started in markets that the Fed was worried about two Spanish banks. Some European banking supervisors became nervous about the Fed's efforts and voiced those concerns.
Unfortunately, the biggest problem is whether the data truly reflects all the risks. That continues to be a matter of intense debate within the central bank. Given the complexity of the trading arrangements within the global financial system, it's far from clear that the banks have a handle on their own exposures. As we learned in 2008, hedges that seemed solid on Monday disappear on Tuesday.
Nevertheless, it's good to know that the Fed isn't flying blind.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Financial Turmoil Evokes Comparison to 2008 Crisis

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
It feels eerily familiar: Stocks are plummeting. The economy is slowing. Politicians are scrambling to find solutions but are mired in disagreement.
Many Americans are wondering whether they are in for a repeat of the financial crisis of 2008.
The answer is a matter of fierce debate among economists and market experts. Many say the risks are lower today -- at least in terms of an immediate crisis -- because the financial system over all is healthier and there are fewer hidden problems. But the experts add that there are reasons to worry, and they do not rule out a quick downward spiral if politicians in the United States and in Europe cannot calm investors by addressing fundamental financial threats.
The core problem, as it was three years ago, is too much debt that borrowers are having a hard time repaying -- but this time it is government debt rather than consumer debt.
''So far it's not as bad as 2008, but it could get much worse because the sovereign debt concerns are much more global than the subprime mortgage risk of 2008,'' said Darrell Duffie, a professor of finance at Stanford and an expert on the banking system. 
A growing lack of confidence is perhaps the most troubling similarity to 2008 and the biggest worry. ''There's a level of fear out there that is a little similar,'' said Michael Hanson, a senior economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ''It's not just the fundamentals. It's the fear of the unknown.''
Most of the attention so far has been focused on volatility in stocks, with investors spooked by three heart-stopping declines in the last five trading days -- including Wednesday's 4.6 percent drop in the Dow Jones industrial average.
But the bigger concern of many financiers and government officials was signs of stress on Wednesday in European credit markets, which are essential to financing the day-to-day operations of banks and companies there.
Unlike the 2008 crisis, which began in the United States and spread worldwide after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the near collapse of the giant insurer American International Group as subprime mortgage defaults surged, today's situation began overseas. The mounting fear about European banks' exposure to sovereign debt is now fraying nerves here.
Financial institutions across Europe have huge holdings of government and corporate bonds from Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Italy and Spain. Concerns about defaults are growing.
Some insist that the comparisons are overblown. ''It feels completely different,'' said Larry Kantor, the head of research at Barclays Capital. ''I don't think there is a U.S. debt crisis right now, and European debt is not held as broadly as mortgage debt or derivative debt was back in 2008. The prospect of a 2008-like drop in the market is remote.''
Experts add it is important not to confuse a stock market rout with an all-out panic.
''I think it's quite different than 2008,'' said John Richards, head of strategy at RBS in Stamford, Conn. ''This is a stock market correction based on slower growth and the increased probability of a recession. In 2008 we had a genuine funding crisis, where banks were reluctant to lend to one another.''
Others on Wall Street maintain that the turmoil is playing out in similar fashion. Traders compare the threat from Greece that prompted the sovereign debt crisis a year ago to Bear Stearns, whose fall in March 2008 was a dress rehearsal for the broader crisis that followed six months later. For these would-be Cassandras, the huge debt loads of Italy and Spain are now equivalent to Lehman and A.I.G., institutions whose downfalls threatened the stability of the entire system.
In an ominous echo of 2008, European bank stocks on Wednesday fell 10 percent or more -- and banks in Europe are beginning to hoard cash, crimping the interbank loans that keep the global financial system operating smoothly. While borrowing costs for banks in the United States and Britain have crept up only slightly recently, borrowing costs for Continental banks that lend to one another have doubled since the end of July.
More optimistic market watchers point out that these rates are still well below those at the height of the financial crisis. But they nonetheless are the highest since the spring of 2009.
Because European banks trade billions of dollars daily with their American counterparts, fears of contagion have spread.
Along with the fear is a measure of denial in the period leading up to now, one more echo from 2008. Even as evidence of the subprime threat mounted through 2007 and into 2008, stocks continued to levitate, with the Dow industrials touching 13,000 not long after Bear Stearns had to be rescued. And even as the economy weakens, Wall Street is still predicting earnings in the fourth quarter to be 23 percent above last year's level, a target that is looking more out of reach by the day.
Then, as now, there were huge stock market swings, up as well as down. For example, the Dow plunged 777 points on Sept. 29, 2008, after Congress initially rejected the proposed Troubled Asset Relief Program bank bailout, only to rise 485 points the next day. But over all they kept plunging, with the Dow bottoming out at 6,547 in March 2009.
There are, however, some very important differences between now and then that could make the banks more resilient.
Financial institutions in the United States have one-third more capital than they did in 2007, and they are better positioned to weather the current storm. And they have reduced their risk-taking. Instead of lending $25 for every $1 dollar worth of capital they hold, they are now lending a more reasonable $16, according to an analysis by Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst with Oppenheimer.
There are other ways the financial system has reduced the amount of debt.
The size of the market for repurchase agreements, or repos, where financial institutions borrow overnight to finance their operations, has shrunk from a peak of $4.57 trillion in March 2008, the month Bear nearly collapsed, to $2.6 trillion in July 2011.
What is more, consumers and companies alike have scaled back their debts -- albeit modestly -- even if governments have not. After increasing their borrowing for more than three straight decades, consumers reversed course and actually owe slightly less now than they did in 2008. Similarly, the number of companies whose short-term debt exceeds their assets is at a 25-year low, lessening the chance of the kind of credit squeeze that hit in the fall of 2008.
Moreover, the scope of the problems today is better understood than in 2008, when policy makers were repeatedly surprised at the amount of subprime mortgage debt and how it had coursed through so many corners of the world's financial system.
Not all the differences are benign, however. Unlike in 2008, when policy makers in the United States moved swiftly to bail out banks and provided guarantees to keep the financial system from seizing up, political divisions in Washington make bold action like another stimulus package much more difficult.
The Federal Reserve also has fewer tools to employ. It has already cut short-term interest rates to nearly zero, and two rounds of injections totaling more than $2 trillion to stimulate the economy have yet to fully restore growth.
''There's only so much the Fed can do,'' added Mr. Hanson, of Bank of America. ''It's a different kind of war now, but we're out of conventional bullets.''
In Europe, where the current crisis originated, political leaders are at least as divided on a course of action as their counterparts in the United States, because different countries there are having a hard time reconciling their different interests.
''We haven't seen policy makers come out with a plan that is viewed as comprehensive, coordinated and credible,'' said Philip Finch, a global bank strategist for UBS. ''We need confidence restored and there's a lot of infighting.''

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Then . . . and Now: Comparisons have been made between the financial crisis and stock market plunge in 2008 and the current downturn on Wall Street. Back then, troubles in the housing market and losses in mortgage lending spurred a full-on panic after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. Credit markets froze, which worsened an economy already in recession. From May 2008, when the charts here begin, to March 2009, stock prices dropped more than 50 percent. This year, the S.& P. 500 has fallen about 18 percent since May, as concerns over government debt in the U.S. and Europe and weak economic growth around the world have mounted.

HEADLINE: A Familiar Brand Promotes a New Line of Cheesy and Easy

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
IN a commercial for Velveeta Cheesy Skillets, a new line of just-add-meat pasta dinner kits by Kraft, a casually dressed woman in a suburban home says, ''Let's go, kids,'' opens the front door and gasps.
''Were you looking for this?'' says a brawny 19th-century blacksmith who wears a leather apron and holds an uprooted metal box with wires dangling and ''Order here'' printed on it. 
''Seems the drive-through is closed tonight,'' he says, raising an iron skillet and a box of the new product. ''Instead -- Velveeta Cheesy Skillets.''
They are then transported to the blacksmith's shop, where he helps her prepare the dish.
''Just brown the meat, stir in the noodles, seasoning, then smite them, smite them with the liquid gold until there can be no more smiting,'' says the blacksmith, played by David S. Lee with the precise diction and syntax of a Shakespearean actor, as he ladles the Velveeta cheese sauce included with the product into the pan.
The spot closes with screen text that says: ''Wield the skillet. Forge the family dinner.''
The commercial, which was first shown on Monday, is by Wieden & Kennedy, Portland, Ore., and is part of a broader campaign that includes online advertising and social network marketing.
In another spot, expected to first broadcast in mid-September but already uploaded to YouTube, a woman is pressing buttons on her microwave when the blacksmith grabs her wrist.
''Reject these cold technological contraptions,'' he says. ''Would you want the shoes of your horse forged in a microwave? Your stove: Use it!''
Adam Grablick, the brand manager for the Velveeta convenient meals division, said the new ads, and the Cheesy Skillets line itself, would resonate with consumers who wanted simplicity but had misgivings about meals that were too simple.
''Our consumer doesn't want to be slaving away in the kitchen, but she may not feel great about just pulling something out of the freezer and putting it in the microwave,'' Mr. Grablick said. ''She wants the meal to be hands-on, and for the meal to come from her hands and her heart.''
Velveeta, which declined to disclose the cost of the new campaign, spent $7.6 million on advertising for all its products in 2010, up from $4.2 million in 2009, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.
Velveeta, the pasteurized process cheese product brand, was purchased by Kraft -- then the Kraft-Phenix Cheese Corporation -- in 1928, according to the company.
Citing Nielsen data, Kraft reports that 40 million American households, or about 34 percent of all households, have purchased a Velveeta product within the last year.
The brand first ventured into shelf-stable meals -- the industry term for foods that normally would require refrigeration but have been processed to be safely stored at room temperature -- with its introduction of Velveeta Shells & Cheese in 1978.
The shelf-stable meal market -- which along with pasta-and-cheese products includes kits for pizza, tacos and sloppy Joes -- grew about 9 percent, to $2.1 billion, from 2005 to 2010, according to the market research firm Mintel. The firm attributes the growth to more consumers eating at home because of the economic downturn.
A hurdle for future growth could be that 39 percent of those who do not like shelf-stable meals blame the taste, according to Mintel. ''The biggest barrier in the category is taste, and we know the taste that consumers are looking for is around great-tasting cheese, and that we can win with consumers around Velveeta,'' said Mr. Grablick, the brand manager.
While Kraft's recipes Web site serves the primary purpose of increasing the usage of Kraft brands, it also has proven useful to the company as a barometer for consumer taste preferences. The four varieties in the Cheesy Skillets line -- chicken and broccoli, ultimate cheeseburger mac, nacho supreme and zesty barbecue chicken -- were modeled after online recipes that had drawn numerous clicks, comments and high ratings, according to Mr. Grablick.
In about 35 reviews of the chicken and broccoli flavor on Amazon.com solicited through its Vine program, where the online retailer provides yet-to-be-released products to some of its frequent reviewers, the Cheesy Skillets line averaged four out of a possible five stars. Reviewers generally lauded the taste, but many were dubious about the packet of dehydrated ''broccoli florets'' that amounted to less than three tablespoons and were described by one reviewer, Julie A. Dawson, as resembling ''dehydrated grass clippings.''
The products, which became widely available in supermarkets this month, have a suggested retail price of $2.39, which does not include, of course, the price of the pound of chicken breast or ground beef required.
On the Cheesy Skillets Facebook page, the blacksmith announces in an introductory video, ''I see you have found me on the book of face.'' Later, he displays an iron version of the social network's ''like'' icon that he has forged, and says, ''Clicketh the button now.''
The approach is reminiscent of another character-driven campaign introduced by Wieden & Kennedy last year for Old Spice, the Procter & Gamble brand, in which the actor Isaiah Mustafa plays Old Spice Man in a series of television commercials and Web videos that have garnered more than 100 million views on YouTube.
''There is a knowing wink with both of these characters,'' said Kenneth Smith, an account director with Wieden & Kennedy, referring to the Old Spice Man and the blacksmith.
But while the dominant trait of the Old Spice Man, who appears shirtless and begins commercials with, ''Hello, ladies,'' is his sex appeal, that is not what the agency was aiming for with the blacksmith.
''What we didn't want was sexual tension between the moms and blacksmith, so we were not looking for a lothario-type guy here,'' Mr. Smith said. ''This is genuinely a guy who you feel like wants to help you and is very sincere in that, so sincere that he almost feels a little awkward.''

HEADLINE: Setting Industry Guidelines for Marketing Junk Food

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Can Big Food Regulate Itself? Fat Chance,'' by Mark Bittman (Opinionator, Aug. 2):
Sure, highly processed junk food doled out by Big Food is horrible for our health. But so are the pork bellies doused in rich cream sauce and the scallops poached in goose fat promoted by fancy restaurants as ''local'' and ''sustainable.'' Should the government regulate these items as well? 
I agree in spirit with Mr. Bittman, but the regulation game strikes me as a Pandora's box that is better left closed.
JAMES McWILLIAMS Austin, Tex., Aug. 3, 2011
The writer is the author of ''Just Food.''
To the Editor:
In response to regulation, many suggest that people just regulate themselves. Yes, consumers need to exercise common sense and self-control in making decisions about their health and diet. But the reality is that consumers face limited choices when corporations gain control of the food system.
This is especially true for consumers who live in low-income areas without political power, and lack education about nutrition, or resources that would enable them to grow, cook or buy healthy food for themselves.
In a perfectly functioning economic world, all consumers would receive perfect education about good nutrition and then simultaneously demand that fast-food companies and grocery stores start offering healthy options, thus forcing Big Food to supply what the people demand.
Until that happens, we need regulation of Nestle, Monsanto, McDonald's and the rest of the moguls that dictate our diets.
ELIZABETH NEWTON Boise, Idaho, Aug. 3, 2011
To the Editor:
Mark Bittman criticizes the food industry's opposition to proposed interagency guidelines on marketing to children, and calls self-regulation ''self-serving.'' In reality, these guidelines are so overreaching that they triggered bipartisan opposition from the most divided Congress in recent history, with Republicans and Democrats sending letters to the administration urging reconsideration of the guidelines and their unintended consequences on the economy, as well as the obesity epidemic itself.
Mr. Bittman doesn't say what most sensible adults already know: that parents are ultimately responsible for what is on their dinner table. I do agree with his brief acknowledgment, in closing, that it is best to have ''grass roots movements'' drive reform. One key step is eradicating food deserts in underserved and rural communities, and mandating daily physical education in public schools across the nation.

HEADLINE: Panel Seeks Stiffer Rules For Drilling Of Gas Wells

BYLINE: By ROBBIE BROWN and IAN URBINA

 BODY:
A federal Department of Energy panel issued recommendations on Thursday for improving the safety and environmental impact of drilling in shale formations for natural gas.
In a report on the drilling technique known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, that is used currently in most oil and gas wells, the seven-member Natural Gas Subcommittee called for better tracking and more careful disposal of the waste that comes up from wells, stricter standards on air pollution and greenhouse gases associated with drilling, and the creation of a federal database so the public can better monitor drilling operations.
The report also called for companies to eliminate diesel fuel from their fracking fluid because it includes carcinogenic chemicals, and for companies and regulators to disclose the full list of ingredients used in fracking. 
''The public deserves assurance that the full economic, environmental and energy security benefits of shale gas development will be realized without sacrificing public health, environmental protection and safety,'' said the report, which was prepared by a subcommittee led by John Deutch, the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and a group of energy experts including Daniel Yergin, chairman of IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates, and Fred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund.
Federal officials should finance the development of more efficient and clean drilling techniques, the report said, adding that fees and taxes on industry were a legitimate way to pay for needed changes in oversight.
The report called for the use of a ''manifest system'' for tracking waste from the wells. Such a system typically requires that each load of waste is tracked as it is transported from handler to handler, from the well to its disposal, to verify that it is not dumped at the side of the road.
Tracking and handling the drilling waste have been especially problematic in Pennsylvania. Drilling is intense in the state, but there is also a shortage of injection wells for disposal of the wells' contaminated wastewater and sludge. State regulators considered instituting a manifest system in 2009, but opted against it after the industry staunchly opposed the proposal.
''We're issuing a call for industry action,'' Mr. Deutch said, ''but we are not leaving it to industry alone.''
In January, an advisory board to the Department of Energy said that it planned to conduct an analysis of natural gas development.
After The New York Times published starting in February a series of articles and internal Environmental Protection Agency documents revealing legal and environmental concerns among the agency's enforcement lawyers about natural gas drilling, President Obama asked Steven Chu, the energy secretary, in May to produce an advisory report within 90 days on ways to improve the oversight of natural gas drilling.
However, the committee has been criticized by all sides since its creation. In three separate letters, 57 New York lawmakers, 28 scientists, and representatives from more than 100 environmental groups cited concerns about the industry ties held by six members of the seven-person panel, including Mr. Deutch, who sits on the board of Cheniere Energy, a company that has plans to export liquefied natural gas.
When the president announced the committee, Republican lawmakers including Representative Fred Upton of Michigan, the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, called the study redundant, pointing to research already under way by the E.P.A.
Some E.P.A. officials have also complained about the committee, which they said seemed to pre-empt and undermine the E.P.A.'s own more rigorous national study on fracking and drinking water. The agency's preliminary findings are expected next year.
The Obama administration has strongly supported expanding drilling for natural gas because it is an abundant domestic and potentially cleaner source of electricity than coal.
However, scrutiny of the industry and questions about what improvements in oversight are needed to proceed safely with this drilling have grown. The Securities and Exchange Commission recently subpoenaed several oil and gas companies about whether they accurately present to investors drilling costs and long-term well performance. The Government Accountability Office, the investigative arm of Congress, was recently assigned to research similar and other questions related to drilling.
Since problems were highlighted, most drilling companies in Pennsylvania have stopped sending their wastewater through treatment plants that were unable to remove many of the contaminants before the water was discharged into rivers. State regulators and drinking water operators are also now testing more regularly for radioactive and other toxic elements in the drilling wastewater.
Federal lawmakers have asked the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the Department of Energy, to answer questions about its natural gas projections and produce documents related to a shale gas Web site that included substantial discussion of the environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing.
Internal agency e-mails published last month in The Times show disagreement about whether the Web site was too critical of the industry, though administration officials have since said logistical concerns were the reason the Web site has not gone online. Those e-mails also feature other Energy Department officials citing their agency's main shale gas primer as too ''rosy'' and encouraging a reporter to look to external publications for additional information.
Thursday's report, however, takes a more nuanced view. It cites the promise of shale gas as having ''enormous potential to provide economic and environmental benefits for the county'' while also highlighting a broader range of risks that need to be addressed.
The report called for further study to settle disagreements in the research about whether natural gas -- when its extraction, transportation, storage and use by consumers are taken into account -- is actually less harmful to the environment than coal or other fuel sources. It also described contamination of drinking water from fracking chemicals as improbable but refers to the risk of gas migrating into aquifers as a greater source of concern needing further study.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about a Department of Energy panel's recommendations for stricter rules for drilling of gas wells misstated part of the name of the investigative arm of Congress recently assigned to research questions related to drilling. It is the Government Accountability Office, not the General Accountability Office.

HEADLINE: Swiss Bank Struggles To Restrain Lofty Franc

BYLINE: By MATTHEW SALTMARSH

 BODY:
LONDON -- The Swiss National Bank announced new monetary measures Wednesday to weaken the surging franc, which it regards as greatly overvalued.
The announcement checked the recent surge in the currency against the dollar and the euro. But analysts said it would be hard for the Swiss authorities to restrain the currency unless global markets stabilized. 
Investors have been eager to hold the franc, pushing it to new highs, even though they receive negative real interest rates for doing so. That reflects their confidence in Switzerland as a stable economy and a lack of faith in other currencies. The euro zone is in the midst of a sovereign debt crisis and Standard & Poor's last week stripped the United States of its AAA credit rating for the first time.
''The massive overvaluation of the Swiss franc poses a threat to the development of the economy in Switzerland and has further increased the downside risks to price stability,'' the Swiss National Bank said in a statement. ''The S.N.B. is keeping a close watch on developments on the foreign exchange market and on financial markets. If necessary, it will take further measures against the strength of the Swiss franc.''
The bank said that it would significantly increase the supply of liquidity to the Swiss franc money market.
It said that it would rapidly expand banks' sight deposits, a liquidity facility through which banks can withdraw money, to 120 billion francs from 80 billion francs. The bank also announced that it would conduct foreign exchange swap transactions to create liquidity in Swiss francs. The measure was last used in 2008.
''If you make a big assumption that global markets are stabilizing and that the Fed may come to the rescue, then the Swiss may get away with it,'' said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist in London at Bank of New York Mellon. ''But it's a big assumption to make at this point.''
The euro rose after the decision, to 1.0402 francs. It had reached a record 1.0075 on Tuesday. Against the dollar, the currency was at 72.34 centimes, down from a record high of 70.71 centimes on Tuesday.
Mr. Derrick said the franc was being undermined Wednesday by fears among traders that the Swiss National Bank might also directly intervene in markets to sell francs. The Bank of Japan sold yen last week to try to choke off inflows to Japan.
Last week, the Swiss National Bank announced that it would aim to keep interest rates ''as close as possible'' to zero and said it would significantly increase the supply of francs in the money market.
But the effect of those measures was short-lived after global stock markets tumbled and investors rushed to safer assets.

HEADLINE: Gloom Grips World's Financial Capitals: Shares Suffer Again in a Blow to Market Confidence

BYLINE: By GRAHAM BOWLEY and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Graham Bowley, David Jolly and Bettina Wassener contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The stock market resumed its downward trajectory on Wednesday as American investors looked with renewed trepidation at the debt problems plaguing Europe and the United States' sputtering economy.
After the rebound in the markets a day earlier when the Federal Reserve promised to keep interest rates near zero for two years, investors appeared to pay closer attention to the Fed's grim assessment of the prospects for the economic recovery and jobs growth.
Investors fled any form of risk and poured into safe-haven investments like Treasury securities and gold, resuming the trend of the last few weeks. Confidence was shaken in the financial health of some of Europe's banks and what their problems might mean for banks in the United States. Bank stocks led the sell-off in the United States, shedding nearly 7 percent. 
Most European markets have entered bear territory, dropping more than 20 percent from recent highs, and the S.& P. 500-stock index is not far behind, lopping off 18 percent since its recent April 29 peak.
Meanwhile, signs of stress are emerging in the short-term financing markets in Europe, where banks borrow billions of dollars everyday from one another and other lenders to finance loans and investments.
Although borrowing costs for banks in the United States and Britain have risen modestly, those for European banks that lend dollars to one another have doubled in the last 10 days to their highest level in the last two years. Still, borrowing costs are roughly one-fourth of where they were during the peak of the financial crisis.
On Wednesday, concerns about Europe's debt crisis swirled across trading floors in New York. For yet another day, the stock market swung back and forth with ranges of hundreds of points. Stocks tried a late afternoon rally, only to plunge anew toward the close.
They finished steeply lower on Wednesday as each of the three main indexes dropped more than 4 percent, generally wiping out the gains of the previous day.
The last time there were three consecutive days of 4 percent moves in the S.& P. was in October 2007.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 4.4 percent to close at 1,120.76. The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 519.83 points, or 4.6 percent, at 10,719.94.
Few are risking a prediction that the market has hit a bottom. It will take a strong dose of rosy economic reports to start to pull stocks up. But instead of being buoyed by positive sentiments, investors are increasingly worried that governments in the United States and in Europe are unable to solve economic problems that may now be getting out of hand.
The fear is that policy makers have few weapons left to reignite growth now that United States interest rates have been pushed close to zero and any fiscal stimulus appears to be off the table in Washington.
''The market psychology is such that investors no longer seem to know who or what to root for, and all that they do know is, according to the Fed, that rates will remain low until the middle of 2013,'' said Kevin H. Giddis, the executive managing director and president for fixed-income capital markets at Morgan Keegan & Company.
As Europe's debt crisis has spread into nations at the heart of the euro zone like Italy and France, it has added a new level of anxiety to markets. There are concerns that France could be overwhelmed if it is called upon to participate in any support for heavily indebted nations like Spain or Italy, and also bail out some of its own banks that hold large amounts of government debt from those shaky countries.
Some French bank stocks fell sharply after there were signs of some stress in bank funding rates in Europe.
Borrowing costs for European banks that lend to one another have doubled to 60 basis points since the end of July, although that is still well below the nearly 200-basis-point level hit at the height of the financial crisis.
Nevertheless, banks were the hardest hit sector in the United States stock market over fears of how vulnerable they are to the troubles in Europe.
''Today it's fears about French banks and France,'' Michael Gapen, United States economist at Barclays Capital in New York, said, singling out the French bank Societe Generale, whose shares fell 14.7 percent. ''SocGen is the name that is really driving trading.''
Analysts said the downbeat assessment of the economy given by the Fed on Tuesday had seeped further into markets, adding to the gloom.
''The Fed came out and said we are staring recession in the face,'' said David Rosenberg, economist at Gluskin, Sheff and Associates.
The VIX index, which had fallen below 40 on Tuesday, rose to a reading of 43. In recent sessions, the index, a measure of stock market volatility, has been back to levels not seen since March 2009, indicating higher levels of stress in the financial system.
The action in government bonds highlighted where investors were placing their priorities. Even after last week's credit rating downgrade on United States debt, the flight from risky assets heated up, with a rise in 10-year government note prices. Yields declined to a 60-year low to 2.10 percent from 2.28 percent on Tuesday.
Gold, a traditional safe haven, surpassed $1,800 an ounce at one point during the day to settle at $1,781.30. It hit another record early in the Asian day, trading at $1,808 an ounce.
Stocks in the Asia-Pacific region opened lower Thursday morning, as the same fears once again dominated sentiment. The Nikkei 225 in Tokyo lost 1.9 percent in the first few minutes of trading, while the Kospi in Seoul sank 3.7 percent. Australia's main index dropped 1.1 percent.
The rise of gold in recent sessions has lifted stocks of gold producers and was one reason that the Canadian stock market, home to a number of mining companies, rose on Wednesday, according to Douglas Porter, an economist at BMO Capital Markets in Toronto.
But Mr. Porter was not optimistic about the future direction of markets -- or the ability of policy makers to address economic problems.
''What we have been dealing with in recent weeks is a crisis of confidence among investors globally in the economic leadership in both the European Union and the United States,'' he said.

HEADLINE: As Investors, Chinese Turn To New York

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
Chinese banks have poured more than $1 billion into real estate loans in New York City in the past year. Investors from China are snapping up luxury apartments and planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on commercial and residential projects like Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn. Chinese companies have signed major leases at the Empire State Building and at 1 World Trade Center, which is the centerpiece of the rebuilding at ground zero.
Investment in the city by companies and entrepreneurs from China has been surging in the last few years, recalling the boom in Japanese investment that swept the region in the 1980s and helping to buoy the local economy even as the country as a whole struggles to get out of recession.
The Chinese investments are occurring with little fanfare, in part because Chinese executives tend to shun publicity. But back home, their government is urging them to invest overseas to diversify China's foreign-exchange holdings, develop business partnerships and improve the country's leverage in international affairs. 
Dan Fasulo, managing director of Real Capital Analytics, which tracks commercial real estate sales, was combing through his files the other day for deals in New York City that involved Chinese investments. As the list grew longer and longer, he paused, a tone of surprise in his voice. ''It's truly amazing how much they've been able to do without being highlighted in public,'' he said.
Delegations of Chinese officials and executives have been sweeping through the city, on a nearly weekly basis, assessing the markets, searching for office locations and meeting prospective partners and clients. Last month, officials and executives from China and the United States filled a ballroom at the Waldorf-Astoria to make deals during a business conference.
''Everybody wants to come to New York because New York is the starting point for going global,'' said Xue Ya, president of the China Center, a business and cultural organization that was the first tenant to sign a lease at 1 World Trade Center, where it will occupy six floors. Once established in New York, Mrs. Xue said, ''you are a player.''
Even one of the region's fastest growing construction companies is Chinese. The company, China Construction America, has won contracts on major public works projects, including the Tappan Zee and Alexander Hamilton Bridges, the No. 7 subway line extension and the $91 million Metro-North Railroad station at Yankee Stadium.
China Construction is a subsidiary of a state-controlled construction company in China. The wave of Japanese investment in the city a generation ago -- epitomized by the purchase of a controlling stake in Rockefeller Center by the Mitsubishi Estate Company of Tokyo in 1989 -- stirred anxiety and even xenophobia. Some New Yorkers saw it as evidence that the city and the country were losing their dominant positions.
This time, city officials are welcoming Chinese investment as a boon to the local economy. But in a report in May, the Asia Society and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars warned that on a national level, protectionist impulses and anti-China sentiment, particularly in Washington, could scare away investors.
Flush with capital from its enormous trade surpluses, China has been on an investment spree, especially in developing countries. While the size of China's investments in the United States pales in comparison with investments by other countries, it has nevertheless been growing rapidly.
''In terms of overall flow from China into the U.S., many of us believe that it could accelerate very quickly, and it could even parallel what Japanese investment did in the mid-'80s,'' said Clarence Kwan, a senior partner at Deloitte, a business services firm.
The Chinese government is acutely interested in diversifying its foreign exchange reserves beyond United States Treasuries. One sign of this is the push by Chinese state-run banks to invest their money in commercial real estate in New York City.
In one of the largest loans by a single lender in the city since 2008, the Bank of China lent $800 million late last year to refinance a building on Park Avenue housing JPMorgan Chase and Major League Baseball, analysts said. Among other deals, the Bank of China recently agreed to lend more than $250 million to refinance an office tower at 3 Columbus Circle.
Analysts, as well as American and Chinese officials, said it was hard to calculate the precise size of Chinese investment in New York, or even the number of deals with Chinese involvement, because of the complexities of international business arrangements and privacy laws. But experts said the current level of interest was only a hint of what could come.
Cong Zhong, chairman of Kingee Cultural Development Company, a conglomerate based in Beijing that makes Chinese decorative products, said he planned a foothold in North America with a flagship retail store on Fifth Avenue. ''If we start from New York,'' Mr. Zhong explained in a telephone interview from Beijing, ''it will be easier to expand.''
Ning Yuan, president of China Construction America, said he had not faced anti-Chinese sentiment. The company, based in Jersey City, uses union workers on its projects in the city.
''So far so good,'' Mr. Yuan said. ''Our company has a lot of experience in the past 20 to 30 years in China. The economy in China is booming, and a lot of the construction projects have been done by our company. It's good for the local market that we can bring our expertise.''
Chinese money is also poised to flow into the city through a federal program that offers the possibility of permanent residency to foreigners who invest at least $500,000 in certain development projects.
Under this program, known as EB-5, Forest City Ratner Companies has arranged for $249 million in loans from Chinese investors for residential and office towers at Atlantic Yards, the commercial and residential project in Brooklyn that includes a new stadium for the New Jersey Nets. The developers of a hospital and hotel project in Flushing, Queens, have lined up about $30 million in financing from China, turning away scores of other interested investors, said Richard Xia, president of the firm raising the money.
Tourism from China is booming in New York as well, helping to sustain the hotel, restaurant and retail sectors. In 2010, 266,000 Chinese people visited the city, a 45 percent increase over 2009, according to NYC & Company, the city's tourism arm.
High-end real estate agents are doing their best to accommodate the influx.
Pamela Liebman, president of the Corcoran Group, said her firm had fielded a ''huge'' increase in inquiries from wealthy Chinese looking for luxury residential properties, ''some in the $30-million-plus range.''
''We went from zero to 200 miles per hour in six months,'' she said. ''This year, it's the biggest buzz word in real estate: 'Chinese.' ''
Xiaolan Shang, an agent with Prudential Douglas Elliman, said that five years ago, she had very few international clients. Now, about 90 percent of her client base is Chinese -- and most pay in cash.
''I've had people come to New York only for the weekend,'' Ms. Shang recalled. ''They see the apartment, they make the offer and right away they fly back to China.''
''Cash deal,'' she added. ''Right away.''

HEADLINE: In Iowa, Ron Paul Keeps His Pitch Low-Key

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WATERLOO, Iowa -- Ron Paul has none of the bravado of his Republican presidential rivals. At a town hall meeting here on Wednesday afternoon, he spoke for 35 minutes and then promptly apologized. 
''Hopefully, I didn't scare you off,'' Mr. Paul, a congressman from Texas, said with a soft voice and a characteristic shrug.
Not likely.
In his second consecutive run for the Republican nomination, Mr. Paul is better known, better organized and on track for what could be a top-three finish at the Ames straw poll on Saturday.
''I'm not predicting that I know we can win or anything like that,'' Mr. Paul told a room of about 75 people in this town in northeastern Iowa.
In fact, rival campaigns suggest that they believe that Mr. Paul might win the straw poll, on the strength of his support among libertarians, college students and an increasing number of traditional Republicans who are now beginning to agree with Mr. Paul's longstanding criticism of government spending and the federal debt.
Asked whether he feels a sense of vindication because of the warnings he long preached about a coming debt crisis for the country, he said he wasn't raised to gloat. ''I don't think you should be out to toot your own horn,'' he said.
His son Rand, a freshman senator from Kentucky, disagreed.
''We should do some gloating,'' said Senator Paul, who is in Iowa campaigning with his father. ''The slogan for the campaign should be, 'Ron Paul was right!'''
Attending a Ron Paul event is not that dissimilar to attending a lecture on history and economics. For more than a half-hour, Mr. Paul discussed the history of the gold standard, talked about the Eisenhower election and its impact on the nation's foreign policy, and railed against American involvement in global conflicts.
Throughout, he got applause and expressions of approval.
''Yes sir!'' one man yelled out when Mr. Paul insisted that as president he would pull America out of the United Nations.
Asked to respond to Republican voters who might think he can't win in a head-to-head race against President Obama, Mr. Paul dismissed the concern, saying that voters should not fear that a vote for him is a wasted vote.
''Wasting a vote is sometimes voting for somebody that you don't really believe in,'' he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Obama as a Hope, and as a President

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''What Happened to Obama?,'' by Drew Westen (Sunday Review, Aug. 7), encapsulates most of what I have been thinking and feeling about the Obama presidency for some time.
Barack Obama has just not been tough enough to confront the myriad transgressions of the Congressional Republicans, who have decimated our economy and our political process.
Further, despite his considerable rhetorical skills, President Obama has failed to articulate a coherent message for change, and has lacked the courage to use the bully pulpit to stand up to the bullies of the right.
As someone who spent long hours working for his election, and who basked in the glow of the inaugural events, I am heartsick about this failure to offer strong, firm and effective leadership, particularly at a time when our country so desperately needs it. 
W. MICHAEL HACKETT Santa Barbara, Calif., Aug. 8, 2011
To the Editor:
President Obama's conciliatory method of problem-solving is not, as Drew Westen describes it, a ''character defect.'' Rather, it is a principled approach to dispute resolution that values respect and dialogue over conflict.
Although it is easy when things are not going the way you had hoped to find comfort in stories of confrontation and villainy -- the kinds of stories Mr. Westen wishes to hear more of -- those stories will not help create the progressive and inclusive society that President Obama (and presumably Mr. Westen) envisions.
Instead of deriding the president's values as defective, we should be commending the president for refusing to sink into a simple ''us versus them'' narrative that may be comforting in the short term but destructive in the long term.
NOAH SISKIND GITTERMAN New York, Aug. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
Like Drew Westen, I find that my high hopes, audacious as they may have been, were first deflated on that bright Inauguration Day. I hadn't realized it then, but what we heard was the first of many lifeless lectures to come from the professor in chief.
His passive handling of the debate over stimulus, jobs and the health public option was even more disappointing. He let his energized, well-organized and better scripted opponents win the message game no matter how far from the truth they wandered.
President Obama has chosen not to use the most effective tool a president has -- the bully pulpit, a tool for which he was especially gifted and one he could have skillfully used to expose the gaping chasms in Republican attacks and narratives.
By finally taking on the deficit over jobs, President Obama has become a weather vane. He was supposed to be the wind.
ELLEN L. GOLDSTEIN Washington, Aug. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
Drew Westen is right about the need for a grand story to explain the economic crisis to the American people, but he is wrong to look backward to the New Deal for its contents. Your grandfather's Democratic Party isn't going to cut it in a world that has been radically transformed by the Internet.
The country needs President Obama's leadership to help us look forward and address our economic problems in new ways that are every bit as creative as the New Deal was in its day, but that aren't the same as the New Deal.
The world has changed, and our political parties need to catch up quick! The gridlock we've been seeing is a form of hanging on to the past for both the Democrats and the Republicans.
SUSAN BURGESS Athens, Ohio, Aug. 8, 2011
The writer is a professor of political science at Ohio University.
To the Editor:
The recent debt-ceiling debacle demonstrated how dangerous Tea Party politics can be, and Drew Westen identifies the biggest problem for President Obama and Congress: the lack of a political narrative strategy.
The Tea Party has an uncompromising narrative strategy with distinct victims and villains, which enables Tea Partiers to cast themselves as heroes who will save yesterday's America from today.
Where is the political narrative strategy of the Democratic Party, or of moderate Republicans? Barack Obama is unwilling to identify a villain, without whom he has nothing to triumph over. Moderate Republicans face a similar challenge.
The debt-ceiling crisis made it crystal clear that the Tea Party is willing to sink the American economy. The Tea Partiers are the villains here, and the presidential candidate who is willing to say so is going to win the 2012 election.
SANDY PETERSON Madison, Wis., Aug. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
What happened to President Obama? What happened is that the people elected an amateur with no record of accomplishment to the presidency. Where a professional is needed to get things done, we have someone who is feckless, except when it comes to rhetoric.
Any way that we can reanimate Lyndon B. Johnson?
SAUL D. RAW Brooklyn, Aug. 8, 2011
To the Editor:
Drew Westen's article combines a narrow vision and shallow psychological analysis.
Let's not forget President Obama's real accomplishments: the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform, the Start treaty, the end of the odious ''don't ask, don't tell'' military policy, two superb Supreme Court nominations, a restored Environmental Protection Agency under Lisa Jackson, a restored Justice Department under Eric H. Holder Jr., an effective secretary of state in Hillary Rodham Clinton and the successful raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
ELIZABETH BAIRD SAENGER Mamaroneck, N.Y., Aug. 8, 2011
To the Editor:
Drew Westen's article struck a nerve! As a die-hard progressive Democrat, I'm hard pressed to be openly critical of President Obama. But I'm fed up with his inability to stick up for all the lofty goals he articulated (and hooked me with) during the campaign.
I know that the leader we desperately need is in there somewhere. He needs to come out now, or he won't get a second chance.
MARIBEL ANDONIAN Cupertino, Calif., Aug. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
Drew Westen's essay offered sobering insight about the psychology of our nation and its president at this time of crisis. But in his take on President Obama's temperament and leadership, Mr. Westen stops short of a very real dynamic at play here: race and identity.
President Obama's centrist posture is an expression of a lifelong struggle to please people and make sense of what it means to be both black and white. It takes great courage to stand up for poor people and against big money in America. But it takes even more to declare who you are in a nation that is most certainly not post-racial.
JUDITH CEBULA Indianapolis, Aug. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
What happened to President Obama? Nothing. He is the same person he described in ''Dreams From My Father,'' as unsure of his own identity and obsessively seeking acceptance from others, all others. But that is not the way governing and politics work.
MICHAEL S. SACHS Westport, Conn., Aug. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
Many people, including me, are disappointed and bewildered by President Obama. We keep waiting for the commander in chief to broker bold, inspiring policies that will end our national despair. That said, the civilly stated but mean-spirited commentary by Drew Westen does a disservice to the president and the people he governs by delivering a one-sided, one-dimensional closing argument that he is a flawed character predestined to fail.
He is in fact a complex man of enormous talent with genuine accomplishments already as president and the promise to grow during crisis.
BRIAN C. JONES Newport, R.I., Aug. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
My profound thanks to Drew Westen for putting into words what I think I've been feeling for quite a while.
As an Obama supporter since the very early days of the campaign, I think that my mind has been afraid to give voice to my inner disappointment over the president's failure to provide real leadership (and hope) in these difficult times.
For the first couple of years I excused his reticence because, I reasoned, it takes a while for a new president to find his footing and because he inherited so many terrible problems. But now, when we need a strong voice to lead us out of the wilderness, Mr. President, where are you?
JUDITH LAVINE Watertown, Mass., Aug. 8, 2011
To the Editor:
The simple answer to Drew Westen's exhaustive article could be this sub-headline answering the question ''What Happened to Obama?'':
''The president has allowed events to control him, not vice versa.''

HEADLINE: Macy's and Polo Ralph Lauren Deliver Strong Quarterly Results

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE CLIFFORD

 BODY:
So far, at least, the tumbling stock market has not hurt one of the country's biggest department store companies nor one of its most popular specialty retailers.
Macy's, the midrange chain that also owns the fancier Bloomingdale's, said Wednesday that it had its most successful second quarter in more than a decade, and that the company's earnings and sales outlook for fall was even better than it had suggested earlier in the year.
Polo Ralph Lauren also had upbeat news on Wednesday. The company said it was increasing its full-year sales projections, telling analysts that it expected sales growth to be in the mid- to high teens, versus the midteens it had projected earlier. 
''We have not yet seen any impact on our customers, both here in the United States or Europe,'' the president and chief operating officer, Roger N. Farah, said.
Polo's stock ended the day up 4.5 percent at $125.28, while Macy's closed down 3.6 percent at $24.52. The Macy's results suggested that shoppers were continuing to buy unnecessary items.
With the stock market's gains for the year more than wiped out in recent trading, one might expect to see shoppers hunkering down for a double-dip recession by sticking to essentials like cotton socks or T-shirts.
Instead, Macy's strongest-performing categories were jewelry, watches, accessories like handbags, cosmetics and fragrances, along with men's clothes and home, said Karen M. Hoguet, chief financial officer of Macy's, in a call with investors.
She also noted that with stylish items, customers were not particularly price-sensitive, and that Macy's had been selling more items at their original prices, rather than having to mark them down.
Macy's profit in the second quarter rose 64 percent to $241 million, or $0.55 a share, above analyst expectations of $0.50 a share. Its sales rose 7.3 percent to $5.94 billion.
''Our outlook for the remainder of the year reflects the optimism we feel about the direction of the business, as well as realism about the macroeconomic environment,'' Ms. Hoguet said.
The ''biggest surprise'' in the Macy's results was its improved projections for the full year, said a Citi analyst, Deborah Weinswig, in a note to clients. Macy's had begun the year saying full-year earnings should be $2.25 to $2.30 a share, then raised that to $2.40 to $2.45 a share. On Wednesday, it said the year should end up even better, increasing projections to $2.60 to $2.65 a share.
It expects its full-year comparable-sales figures, or revenue at stores open at least a year, to increase between 4.8 and 5.1 percent, it said Wednesday, which is even higher than the 4.8 percent it had projected in July. And despite the stock market swings this month, August should be Macy's strongest month in the quarter, Ms. Hoguet said.
Because luxury shoppers often buy or hold back based on what the stock market is doing, analysts were particularly interested in Macy's Bloomingdale's division, which sells $253 jeans and $2,650 Gucci watches.
Asked if she had seen any slowdown at Bloomingdale's as the stock market has fallen, Ms. Hoguet replied that ''A, we have not, but B, I think it's a little bit early to be judging.'' The Bloomingdale's business was ''very strong,'' she said.
Robert Drbul, an analyst with Barclay's Capital, said he was encouraged by that assessment. ''Right now we're all sort of holding our breath waiting to see if there is a reaction, but it appears to date that you really haven't seen anything,'' he said.
Polo Ralph Lauren reflected similar trends. Full-price selling ''worked so extraordinarily well'' in the quarter, Mr. Farah said.
Profit rose 52 percent from the same quarter a year earlier, to $184.1 million, or $1.90 a share. Analysts tracked by Bloomberg had expected earnings of $1.47 a share. Revenue rose 32 percent, to $1.53 billion.
A fuller picture of the stock market's effect on retailing may emerge soon, with Nordstrom and Kohl's reporting on Thursday, J.C. Penney and Dillard's on Friday, and Saks Fifth Avenue and Wal-Mart on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Gloom Grips World's Financial Capitals: Banking Sector Punished Over European Debt

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Fear is on the rise again that worsening problems at some of Europe's biggest banks may wind up hurting financial institutions in the United States.
The clearest signs of the anxiety are in the stock market, where shares of American banks plunged again on Wednesday. Bank of America dropped almost 11 percent. Citigroup sank 10.5 percent. Goldman Sachs fell 10 percent, while Morgan Stanley was down 9.7 percent.
All told, bank stocks have fallen more than 30 percent since the beginning of the year -- and have swung wildly up and down over the last week -- as the weakening economy is expected to take a toll on business and reduce earnings. 
But concerns about European banks are driving the latest wave of selling. Societe Generale's share price dropped 14.7 percent on Wednesday, the most of any European bank, as its chief executive ''denied all rumors'' that he said caused the stock to fall.
Other European giants were alsopounded. Shares of Intesa Sanpaolo of Italy fell nearly 14 percent. Credit Agricole and AXA Financial of France dropped more than 10 percent apiece.
Financial institutions across the Continent have huge holdings of government and corporate bonds from Italy and Spain. Doubts about the financial health of European lenders are encouraging investors to unload their shares and driving up their borrowing costs.
Those banks, in turn, trade billions daily with their counterparts on Wall Street. They also rely on billions of dollars invested by American money market mutual funds to finance loans and other investments.
That has created a vicious circle, where fears about the soundness of European banks are feeding new concerns about the stability of American financial institutions.
''The European situation is back and isn't going away,'' said Alex Roever, the head of short-term fixed income at JPMorgan Chase. ''It continues to keep pressure on the market.''
Only a few months ago, American banks looked as if they had finally found their footing. Loan losses were easing. Profits and bonuses were back. Even some of the new regulations had turned out to be not as draconian as many bankers once believed.
But there has been a steady drumbeat of dismal headlines in the last few weeks. First, weak data for the housing market and the broader economy suggested that banks would find it even harder to grow. Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States government further rattled confidence, the lifeblood of the financial system.
Then, in a sign of how grim things had become, the Federal Reserve took the unprecedented step of pledging to keep interest rates near zero for the next two years. That may prevent the economy from slipping into another recession, but it will squeeze lending profits that make up the bulk of banks' income.
And that comes as demand is already slowing for all kinds of loans and a wave of deal making has been shelved.
''Everyone is going to be lowering their estimates,'' said David Ellison, the chief investment officer of two FBR mutual funds that invest in financial companies. ''You are going to have lower loan growth and lower margins; we are in a new era.''
If that were not enough, there are lingering worries about the legal hangover from the housing bust. Bank of America, which faces potentially tens of billions of dollars in investor claims, held an unusual conference call on Wednesday to reassure shareholders it could cope with all settlements, among other concerns. Its shares fell to $6.77 on Wednesday, after reaching a postcrisis high of almost $20 in April 2010.
Now, as Europe's fiscal troubles spread to core trading partners like France, there are renewed fears of contagion. The links between French and American institutions, after all, are orders of magnitude larger than they are between American banks and say, Greek, or even Spanish ones.
For example, according to the Bank for International Settlements, French banks owed American institutions more than $160 billion at the end of 2010. Spanish banks owed less than $20 billion. And that's not counting the billions of dollars that big American banks lend directly to overseas companies or any European government debt they hold as investments.
Nowhere is that nervousness greater than in the short-term financing markets, where European banks turn to American money funds each day for tens of billions of dollars in funding.
Interbank borrowing rates are still well below where they were at the height of the financial crisis. But they have been drifting higher over the last week for several big European lenders, creating ominous echoes to the fall of 2008.
In particular, American money funds, one of the main providers of financing, have been cutting back their exposure to French banks. They are concerned about the banks' holdings of Italian and Spanish government debt, as well as the possibility of France losing its top credit rating -- something the major agencies have said is not currently on the table.
In July, American money funds and other suppliers of short-term credit chose not to refinance more than $38 billion of short-term notes issued by European banks, with more than half belonging to French lenders, according to JPMorgan research. And as recently as Wednesday, French banks, like Societe Generale, were forced to pay more to borrow dollars.
In one sign of the funding pressure, what banks charge each other to swap euro-denominated assets into dollars is now around 80 basis points, compared with 10 basis points a few months ago.
Still, thanks to emergency support measures taken by the world's central banks and tens of billions of dollars stockpiled in the Fed's reserves, European lenders have not run short on cash. That is one sliver of good news, although little consolation to those who invest in American banks.
Shares of Goldman Sachs, for example, are now trading at just over $110, down from their postcrisis peak of $192 in October 2009. Morgan Stanley shares are now at $16.45, a price not seen since the market bottomed in March 2009.
Citigroup shares are trading at $28.49, about the same level on a split-adjusted basis as they were a few weeks after the bank's shares dropped below $1 in March 2009.
''Clearly, the problems in Europe and the growing risk of recession makes banks less valuable,'' said Douglas J. Elliott, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''The extreme nature of the reaction reflects panic.''

HEADLINE: 6 Republicans Named to Congressional Committee to Reduce the Deficit

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The top Republicans in the House and the Senate appointed six lawmakers on Wednesday to a powerful new Congressional committee that is supposed to find ways to reduce federal budget deficits by at least $1.5 trillion over 10 years.
Two of the Republican appointees have a history of working with Democrats. All oppose tax increases, but at least one supports eliminating tax breaks like the subsidies for ethanol. 
The speaker, John A. Boehner, chose the three House Republicans: Jeb Hensarling of Texas and Dave Camp and Fred Upton, both from Michigan.
Mr. Hensarling, the chairman of the House Republican Conference, will be co-chairman, along with Senator Patty Murray, Democrat of Washington.
The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, chose Senators Jon Kyl of Arizona, Rob Portman of Ohio and Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania for the 12-member panel.
The panel, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, is supposed to come up with recommendations by Nov. 23. If it fails, or if its proposals are not enacted, the government will automatically cut spending across the board to ensure savings.
If just one panel member crosses party lines, the committee can send its recommendations to the floor of the House and the Senate for up-or-down votes without amendments. If a deal is to be struck in the middle, it is likely to involve Mr. Portman, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and perhaps Senator Max Baucus of Montana, Congressional aides said.
People who favor a ''grand bargain'' say they hope panel members will feel pressure to be less dogmatic than usual because of several factors: the recent downgrade of the United States government's credit rating, the weakness of the American economy, the plunge in the stock market and a loss of public confidence in federal officials -- what Standard & Poor's described as the weakening of ''American policymaking and political institutions.''
Robert L. Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan budget watchdog group, said the nine members named so far did not inspire optimism. ''I would not call it a dream team for a grand bargain,'' he said.
''If the joint committee does anything serious,'' Mr. Bixby added, ''it will have to include changes in taxes and entitlement programs'' like those recommended by the co-chairmen of President Obama's deficit reduction commission, Erskine B. Bowles, a Democrat, and former Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Republican.
Three members of the new panel -- Mr. Baucus, Mr. Camp and Mr. Hensarling -- were members of the Bowles-Simpson group and voted against its proposal, Mr. Bixby said.
Changes in Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and tax policy are all on the table for the new panel.
Mr. Camp is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, which has authority over taxes, Medicare and Social Security. Mr. Upton is chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, which has authority over Medicaid and parts of Medicare.
Senate Democrats on the new panel, besides Mrs. Murray, are Mr. Baucus and Mr. Kerry. Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, has until Tuesday to fill the remaining three slots on the panel.
Mr. Kyl, the No. 2 Senate Republican; Mr. Toomey, a former president of the Club for Growth; and Mr. Hensarling, a former chairman of the Republican Study Committee, are among the most conservative members of Congress and rarely vote with Democrats on issues that split the parties. Mr. Toomey voted last week against the bill that raised the debt limit, saying it did not do enough to cut spending.
In more than two decades in Congress, Mr. Upton, a moderate conservative, has often shown an independent streak. He supported expansion of the Children's Health Insurance Program, for example. But last fall, under fire from conservatives, he tacked to the right in his successful effort to become chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
Mr. Portman, a House member from 1993 to 2005, was White House budget director and United States trade representative under President George W. Bush. In Congress, he has worked well with Democrats -- on pension and tax issues, for example -- even as he has voted consistently with other Republicans.
Mr. Kyl, who delves into the details of legislation and policy, is a member of the Finance Committee and participated in deficit reduction talks with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in May and June. He has resisted cuts in military spending and in Medicare payments to doctors and health maintenance organizations.
In 2004 and 2005, Mr. Hensarling proposed an overall cap on spending for most entitlement programs other than Social Security.
Lobbyists for older Americans, veterans and poor people opposed the idea, saying that it could lead to deep cuts in such programs.
Mr. Toomey served three terms in the House, from 1999 to 2005, when he became president of the Club for Growth, which champions low taxes, free markets and limited government. He said Wednesday that the new panel would have to bridge an ideological gulf.
''If this committee is going to be successful,'' Mr. Toomey said, ''it absolutely has to have bipartisan support. This has to be done in a cooperative fashion. It has to be an exercise in finding common ground between Republicans and Democrats.''
Mr. Toomey said he had voted to eliminate ethanol subsidies and added: ''If we tackle tax policy, and I hope we will, the goal should be to broaden the base and lower rates so we can create an environment that's more conducive to economic growth. That will also generate more revenue. A stronger economy always does.''
Mr. Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, has fought to ''end the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy.'' He says high-income people should not receive an extension of tax cuts scheduled to expire on Dec. 31, 2012.
Mr. Baucus has also tried to end tax breaks that benefit oil and gas companies and hedge fund managers.
The nine panel members have experience in the ways of Washington and would not be expected to deviate much from the priorities of their party leaders.
Mr. Camp has been investigating how to overhaul the tax code to promote economic growth, but has opposed what he calls ''job-killing tax increases.''
He and Mr. Upton have sometimes joined Democrats in supporting legislation to help the unemployed. ''Being from Michigan, where families have endured 31 consecutive months of double-digit unemployment,'' Mr. Upton said, ''I know how important it is to get our economy back on track and get Americans back to work.''

HEADLINE: With Return to Iowa, Romney Heeds Call Of G.O.P. Strategists

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
PELLA, Iowa -- Mitt Romney has kept a cautious distance from Iowa after Republicans here helped dash his presidential aspirations four years ago, but he stood before a lush soybean field on Wednesday and declared that his second White House bid depended on a path through this state.
''Oh, you'll see me plenty in Iowa,'' Mr. Romney said, smiling broadly as a light breeze rippled. He looked ahead to next year, adding: ''Iowa will be a swing state. I don't think the president will win it. I think I'll win, if I'm the nominee.'' 
As Republican presidential hopefuls descended on Iowa for their second major debate on Thursday in Ames, the return of Mr. Romney came at a turning point in his candidacy. His wait-and-see approach toward campaigning in Iowa has been complicated by the expected candidacy of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, whose strategy includes waging a full effort in the caucuses early next year that open the nominating battles ahead.
A rising contingent of Republicans is urging Mr. Romney to bring his economic-driven message to the state if he wants to show the strength of his candidacy and avoid becoming overshadowed by the campaigning that will unfold here over the next six months. Party leaders say that a vigorous contest here will produce a stronger nominee for the party, and that ceding this ground to Mr. Perry could give the Texan a path to further victories, like in South Carolina, which votes after New Hampshire.
''He has to change his strategy and go toe to toe with a guy like Rick Perry,'' said Doug Gross, who served as the Iowa chairman of Mr. Romney's 2008 campaign, but is unaligned this year. ''There's a ton of people out here who are Romney supporters last time that, frankly, are still looking for a place to go. He's got this capital in the bank; he needs to use it.''
The play-it-safe strategy that has sustained Mr. Romney through the summer has run its course. His survival going forward, his advisers acknowledge, is dependent upon increasingly defending, and distinguishing, himself from the Republican field. He also is poised to take more risks, the first of which will be his decision on how to calibrate his strategy toward Iowa, a state he has so far shied away from while concentrating on New Hampshire.
A full preview to the 2012 presidential campaign is unfolding here. Not only is President Obama visiting the state next week, the full breadth of the Republican field is also on display.
The debate on Thursday, which for the first time will include Jon M. Huntsman Jr., is followed by the Iowa straw poll on Saturday. Sarah Palin abruptly announced on Wednesday that she, too, intends to visit the Iowa State Fair this week. And Mr. Perry signaled his plan to spend up to three days in Iowa starting Sunday.
While Mr. Romney is not actively participating in the straw poll, his name will be on the ballot, which could provide at least a window into where he stands with some Republicans. A quiet effort has been under way here to rally his old supporters -- Mr. Romney joined a conference call with local leaders a few weeks ago -- if the decision is made to increase his effort in Iowa.
''To me, Governor Perry is Mr. Romney's worse nightmare,'' said Richard Schwarm, a former Iowa state party chairman who was a senior adviser to Mr. Romney during the last campaign.
''If either Governor Perry or Governor Pawlenty wins Iowa, they get tremendous momentum and take a ton of voters away from Governor Romney,'' Mr. Schwarm added. ''Governor Perry could all of sudden become so strong that the support Governor Romney built in New Hampshire could fall apart.''
While it can be difficult to disentangle political reality from the parochial views that accompany the traditions of the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, the pace of the Republican presidential race is undoubtedly accelerating. Decisions made now will impact how the campaign plays out in the fall.
Mr. Romney, who has purposely kept a low profile for months to avoid being drawn into exchanges with other Republicans, is steadily increasing his presence on the campaign trail. He moderated a discussion on the economy during a visit to a manufacturing company in Pella, but reserved his sharpest critique for the president during a question-and-answer session with reporters.
''He won't carry Iowa in November 2012,'' Mr. Romney said. ''He won't carry Iowa because Iowans will recognize that his presidency has failed. He is not up to the task of leading the country at a time of economic crisis, and that's what we have.''
When asked about Mr. Perry's record of job creation in Texas, Mr. Romney focused on his own background, but offered a window into contrasts he will eventually draw.
''I think I'm the right guy to be the Republican nominee for president, in part because I spent 25 years in the private sector and I know how the economy works,'' Mr. Romney said. ''He's a fine man and a fine governor, and the record of Texas, I think, speaks for itself.''
While Mr. Romney traveled here to participate in a Fox News debate, he also was using the trip as a listening tour for his prospects in Iowa, a state that frustrated him four years ago after he invested about $10 million and took second place to Mike Huckabee.
He is visiting the Iowa State Fair, where he asked Senator Charles E. Grassley, the state's senior Republican, to accompany him. Mr. Grassley said he would encourage Mr. Romney to start making his case more aggressively to voters for why he is the best Republican candidate to turn around the beleaguered economy.
''He's in the lead, but he still hasn't proven himself,'' Mr. Grassley said in an interview. ''He is riding high in the polls right now because he's a businessman, but he is not so high. He has to come here, compete for delegates and convince people.''

HEADLINE: Gloom Grips World's Financial Capitals: Growing Concern Over France's Top Credit Rating Spreads Market Anxiety

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN; David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris, Nelson Schwartz and Louise Story from New York and Landon Thomas Jr. from London.

 BODY:
PARIS -- With the sense of economic crisis deepening in Europe after the United States debt downgrade, investors have played Who's Next with the shrinking list of nations that still hold the top rating of AAA. And their sights have landed on France.
Shares of French financial institutions were hammered Wednesday on the Paris stock exchange on mounting fears that France's own sterling credit rating could be cut, if the cost of cleaning up the European debt crisis weighs on the nation and its banks. 
French banks are loaded up on the debt of Italy and Greece, among other troubled European countries that share the euro.
It seemed not to matter that the French government -- along with the credit raters Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch -- issued statements on Wednesday insisting France's rating was not at risk. The market anxieties spread wildly, engulfing Societe Generale, the second-largest French bank. Its shares slumped as much as 21 percent before closing down by 14.7 percent.
Stock in BNP Paribas, France's largest bank, fell 9.5 percent.
President Nicolas Sarkozy interrupted his vacation on the French Riviera to return to Paris for an emergency meeting with finance officials to discuss ''the economic and financial situation'' of France, whose government debt and budget deficit make it look the weakest of any big AAA-rated nation.
Mr. Sarkozy gave his ministers a deadline to prepare measures to ensure that France meets its deficit reduction targets, which it had trouble doing in the past. Analysts say France also needs to stoke growth and cut its high sovereign debt, which S.& P. cited in its note accompanying the American downgrade on Friday.
That note projected that France's debt in the year 2015 would be 83 percent of its gross domestic product -- even higher than the 79 percent S.& P. forecast for the United States by that year.
S.& P. also indicated that it expected France and other AAA-rated nations to have their debts and deficits more under control than the United States by then. But the vultures now circling France apparently did not read, or at least heed, that caveat.
''There has been a lot of market noise about France, rather than ratings agency noise,'' said Gary Jenkins, a strategist at Evolution Securities. ''On the other hand, there was market noise about the PIGS and the United States before they were downgraded,'' he noted, using an acronym for the European countries swept up in the debt crisis -- Portugal, Ireland, Greece and Spain.
The annual cost to insure $10 million in French government debt against default jumped to a record $175,000 on Wednesday, up from only $100,000 three weeks ago. The cost also hit records for Societe Generale and BNP Paribas.
French banks are among the most exposed to Greek, Spanish and Italian debt, and they also hold huge amounts of French sovereign debt.
Societe Generale, a globally interconnected bank that the French government regards as too big to fail, moved closer to the eye of the storm recently. It has significant exposure to Greece through a retail subsidiary there, and it holds vast sums of troubled debt from small and large European economies.
On Wednesday, it was hit in particular by talk that Groupama, a large French insurer that owns about 4 percent of Societe Generale, needed to raise money. Groupama did not return calls for comment.
But David Thebault, head of quantitative sales trading at Global Equities in Paris, noted that many other European insurance companies, as well as banks, were scrambling after S.& P. downgraded the United States to AA+ from AAA. Many of those companies and banks need to replace their United States Treasury securities because they are required to hold only top-rated sovereign debt.
''Volatility is very high -- we're in quasi-crisis mode,'' he said.
Societe Generale issued a lengthy statement after the close of trading, saying it ''categorically and vigorously'' denied all the ''completely unfounded'' market rumors that affected its share price. The bank, which reported a 1.6 billion euro ($2.28 billion) first-quarter profit last week, said it had asked the French stock market regulator to investigate the source of the rumors.
The big fear in the markets, though, is the threat of contagion -- whatever the reason for the tumult.
''We've been really cautious, and the sovereign crisis is now escalating,'' said Philip Finch, global bank strategist for UBS. ''It boils down to a crisis of confidence. We haven't seen policy makers come out with a plan that is viewed as comprehensive, coordinated and credible.''
Despite France's undisputed influence as Europe's biggest power broker next to Germany, its debt as a percentage of gross domestic product is expected to reach 85.3 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. That would be the highest among any European country in the AAA club.
France's budget deficit, meanwhile, will hit 5.7 percent of G.D.P., the I.M.F. said, well above the 2.3 percent forecast for Germany, and the second-highest in Europe after Britain.
And despite an array of world-class companies like LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton, L'Oreal, Renault and Danone, France's economy is gripped by labor market rules and other factors that keep it from growing faster.
The economy is expected to grow only 2 percent this year and next, slower than the 3.4 percent pace of Germany. Unemployment is around 9 percent.
Mr. Sarkozy pledged on Wednesday to find new ways to cut the deficit and reduce France's huge debt ratio, which would swell if a widening crisis forced France to supply tens of billions more euros to pay the cleanup bill. But just as President Obama's speech on the American economy on Monday fell on deaf ears, so, too, did markets ignore Mr. Sarkozy's promises.
The French president has made it a priority to avoid a sovereign debt downgrade on his watch, especially as he girds for a campaign in the presidential elections scheduled for 2012.
Mr. Sarkozy has emphasized France's strong stewardship of the European crisis. But that could come back to haunt his political ambitions if the crisis devours his own country.

HEADLINE: Signs of Doubt On Assad Rule Grow in Syria

BYLINE: By ANTHONY SHADID and STEVEN LEE MYERS; Anthony Shadid reported from Beirut, and Steven Lee Myers from Washington. Hwaida Saad and Nada Bakri contributed reporting from Beirut.

 BODY:
BEIRUT, Lebanon -- As Syria continues its most relentless assault yet on a five-month uprising, killing more than a dozen protesters Wednesday, cracks have begun to emerge in a tight-knit leadership that has until now managed to rally its base of support and maintain a unified front, officials, dissidents and analysts say.
Though there are no signs of an imminent collapse, flagging support of the business elite in Damascus, divisions among senior officials and even moves by former government stalwarts to distance themselves from the leadership come at a time when Syria also faces what may be its greatest isolation in more than four decades of rule by the Assad family.
''They're starting to be divided, and you have people in the government who are really getting frustrated with Assad and his security circles,'' an Obama administration official in Washington said, referring to President Bashar al-Assad. 
''It's almost like watching a dysfunctional marriage,'' the official said.
The shifting constellation of power in Damascus has underscored the perils of the months ahead. American and European officials acknowledge that they have limited tools to influence events in Syria, and a deeply divided opposition has so far failed to provide an alternative to the leadership of Mr. Assad. Activists in Syria warn that the government crackdown may also push largely peaceful protesters to violence, especially in the east, which is populated by well-armed extended clans with deep ties to Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq.
''We are stuck right now,'' said Louay Hussein, a leading opposition figure who has had conversations with government officials on trying to open the political system ''The government is counting on its military, and it could take a very long time before it uses up all its resources.''
An American diplomatic official said it seemed increasingly unlikely that Mr. Assad could remain in power. As a result, he said, the United States has begun making plans for a post-Assad era out of concern for the chaos that many expect to follow, should he fall. The Obama administration, he said, does not rule out a civil war. ''It's going to be messy,'' the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the topic involved internal deliberations.
In Washington, the Obama administration has continued to ratchet up pressure on Syria. The Treasury Department announced Wednesday that it had sanctioned the state-owned Commercial Bank of Syria, along with a Lebanese-based subsidiary and Syriatel, the country's largest mobile telephone operator. Syriatel is owned by Rami Makhlouf, a powerful businessman and a cousin of the president who was first sanctioned by the United States in 2008. The United States has already imposed sanctions on most of the country's senior leaders, including President Assad, and several other businesses with close ties to the government.
Officials said European countries might take a decisive step to sanction Syria's oil and gas industry this month, which would cripple one of Syria's few remaining sources of revenue as its economy reels under the strain of the uprising. In Washington, officials say President Obama may soon declare that Mr. Assad must step down, a pronouncement the White House has so far been reluctant to make.
Turkey, once an ally of Syria, remains a wild card that could ease the pressure on Mr. Assad or intensify it. Its foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, went to Damascus on Tuesday, and American officials said he gave Mr. Assad a two-day deadline to end the crackdown. Though Turkish officials have said they are running out of patience, they still appear to hold out hope that Mr. Assad will make democratic changes in one of the region's most repressive countries. It is a position few others share.
''We're not on the same page,'' the American official acknowledged.
In Damascus this week, 41 former Baathists and government officials took a step that would have been unthinkable for party stalwarts not long ago: They announced an initiative for a political transition. Led by Mohammed Salman, a former information minister with deep connections to the leadership closest to Mr. Assad, the group urged an end to the crackdown, the deployment of the military and the relentless arrest campaign.
Otherwise, the group warned, the country was headed for ''catastrophic results.''
Some opposition figures dismissed the initiative as trying ''to whiten its black page in the past.'' But to others it represented a remarkable fissure, coming as it did from former ministers and senior party officials who at the very least acknowledged that change was inevitable.
Through much of his reign, Mr. Assad had managed to conceal the ferocity of the ubiquitous police state his father, Hafez, built after taking power in 1970. Since the uprising, the military and, in particular, the security forces have returned to the forefront, and they have remained unified despite occasional defections in carrying out a crackdown that some activists say has killed more than 2,000 people. Unless armed forces turn against Mr. Assad, analysts and diplomats say, there is no immediate threat to his rule.
But as the government has resorted almost solely to violence in repressing the uprising, with more killed Wednesday in the central city of Homs, in Idlib in the north, in Nawa in the south and in the Damascus suburbs, frustration appears to be growing within the inner circle. That has pitted hard-line members of Mr. Assad's family -- figures like Maher al-Assad, his brother, and Assef Shawkat, his brother-in-law -- against some longtime officials who remain in contact with foreign colleagues.
Some analysts and diplomats say Mr. Assad himself has yet to appreciate the depth of the challenge posed by the uprising. Others said senior officials remain convinced the uprising is led by militant Islamists. A Western official, citing multiple accounts, said security forces went so far as to use antiaircraft guns against civilian buildings in Hama, which the military attacked July 31.
''The level of frustration within the regime right now is unprecedented,'' said a Damascus-based analyst with access to Syrian officials who asked not to be named.
''The regime has played all its cards,'' the analyst said. ''The one left is a constant increase in levels of repression and violence, and I think that will fail, too. That's what it's trying now, but I don't think that will be successful, either. Then after that, what's left?''
Damascus and Aleppo, Syria's two largest cities, have remained quiet, as the economic elite in both locales remain fearful of a chaotic aftermath to Mr. Assad's government. But officials and analysts say more and more businessmen have reached out to the opposition, including a leading figure from the Alawite minority, from which Mr. Assad's leadership disproportionately draws its support. Others seem to be trying to keep channels open to both sides, as they wait to see which party gains a decisive edge, analysts said.
''They're starting to turn to us, to the United States, and say, 'What can we do? How can we help?' '' the American official said. ''The domino effect is going to go even faster for the Sunni business elite, and that's when you'll see Damascus go up in flames.''
Even some activists, who long insisted colleagues chant ''peaceful!'' at their protests, warned of the shape any change might take. In Hama, Saleh al-Hamawi, an activist, said youths were insisting on taking up arms after the military's assault.
'' 'Either they kill us or we kill them,' I heard them saying the other day,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Mitt's Vanishing Act

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
Pella, Iowa
If the Iowa Republican debate were to provide a truly accurate mirror of the race at this juncture, Tim Pawlenty would wear a sandwich board, with a scrawled plea to the state's voters: ''Save me.'' Michele Bachmann would spin onto the stage in a giant teacup, to find a microphone three times the size of anyone else's and a spotlight four times as bright. Newt Gingrich, looking characteristically put out, would unveil a new campaign slogan: ''The Glower for This Hour.''
And the party's most likely nominee, Mitt Romney? He wouldn't show. The less seen of him, after all, the better. 
That's not my harsh assessment. That's been his de facto campaign strategy this summer.
His curious absence through the debt-ceiling showdown even set off a spirited name game in the news media, with different scribes lofting different sobriquets: the missing Mormon, the phantom front-runner and (courtesy of Ben Smith of Politico) a denizen of the Mittness Protection Program.
Couple his low profile with his history of reinvention and you wind up with a candidate who campaigns in disappearing ink. It's tough to get a read on him, and he leaves no strong impression.
He did, in fact, emerge from Mittness Protection and materialize (or is that Mitterialize?) in Iowa on Wednesday, in advance of the debate, which he will actually attend. But he'll leave before the straw poll on Saturday. Now you see him. Now you don't.
I saw him midday here in Pella, where he took a seat at a drab conference table in a drab conference room for a meeting with about a dozen local business leaders. There was no campaign regalia, no boldly colored backdrop, nothing to draw or hold the eye.
''Looks like I get a microphone,'' he said, noting the instrument before him. ''But I'm not planning on saying much.''
Over the ensuing hour, as the business leaders bemoaned the economy, he did a lot of listening and nodding, punctuated with such measured words in such a mild voice that it was possible to register only his teeth, tan and dangling forelock. Assuming you eluded slumber.
Can Romney get all the way to the White House like this? There's still plenty of time for him to step it up, but, for now, he is doing something risky and remarkable: asking people to vote for him while encouraging them to look away. The case he's making is more anti-Obama than pro-Romney, and it's only when he's bashing the president that his words catch fire, or his emberlike approximation of it.
He personifies the Republican bind in 2012. Party leaders believe (with excellent reason) that Obama is eminently beatable, yet they're fretful (as they should be) that they're squandering that opportunity with a field of candidates too weak for the task.
Rick Perry doesn't really change that. His record in Texas is more complicated and less flattering than the bonanza of job creation he and his supporters extol, and he may be a Texan too soon with a political orientation too conservative for a country still shaking off George W. Bush. The attention lavished on him over recent days suggests Republicans' yearning for someone to swoop in and save the day.
This yearning has even bequeathed poetry, with Bill Kristol penning sonnets of sorts to politicians he wishes would run. Following up on a Chris Christie poem he published in March, Kristol used the most recent issue of The Weekly Standard for an ode to the likes of Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush.
''At our back we all now hear/Time's winged chariot hurrying near,'' he wrote, referring either to the few months left to get into the race or to ''Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.'' It wasn't clear. He further implored the resisters to ''manfully embrace your fate/and boldly be a candidate.'' That he didn't say ''womanfully'' suggests a prudent change of heart. Kristol helped foist Sarah Palin on the world.
Suddenly, she's en route to Iowa, endlessly teasing out the mystery of her intentions. As for Romney, his comportment on Wednesday was less manful than muted, less bold than bland. He seemed to be running for management consultant in chief.
''Wouldn't it be nice,'' he asked the business leaders, ''if people in Washington actually spent a part of their career working in the real economy?'' When someone responded that it should be a prerequisite, he said, ''If that's the case, then I'm in.''
He'll need a more rousing argument, starting with the debate, for which I offer this couplet of counsel: ''Find your passion and some will/Lest Chitty turn you to road kill.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Seeks Ideas on Renting Out Its Foreclosure Inventory

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Uncle Sam wants you -- to rent a house from Uncle Sam.
The Obama administration said on Wednesday that it was soliciting ideas on how to turn the federal government's inventory of foreclosed houses into rental properties that could be managed by private enterprises or sold in bulk.
The goal, the administration said, is to stabilize neighborhoods where large supplies of empty, foreclosed properties have hurt property values. In addition, the plan is an effort to clear the nation's balance sheet of real estate holdings that, because they have been difficult to sell individually, have hung over the housing market and stunted sales of existing homes and new construction. 
The Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Treasury Department are jointly requesting ideas for sales, partnership ventures or other strategies that would help to unload approximately 250,000 properties owned by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration. Those properties account for about half of all properties that have been foreclosed upon and are still awaiting resale nationwide.
As it considers the proposals, the government-sponsored enterprises that now own the houses will continue to offer individual properties for sale, Edward J. DeMarco, acting director of housing finance agency, said Wednesday. But the government says it believes that given the slow pace of those sales, it must find new ways in which properties can be pooled, sold and privately managed as rentals.
Greater flexibility in disposing of the houses will have other benefits as well, Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said. ''Exploring new options for selling these foreclosed properties will help expand access to affordable rental housing, promote private investment in local housing markets and support neighborhood and home price stability,'' he said in a statement announcing the new program.
While home prices have remain depressed since the 2008 financial crisis, rental prices have not come down. The Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University reported in the spring that more than 10 million households -- or one-quarter of all renters -- pay more than half their income for housing, a record level.
''We have to find and promote new ways to alleviate the strain on the affordable rental market,'' Shaun Donovan, secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said.
John Taylor, president of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, said in an interview that an added benefit of such a program would be the creation of construction jobs for rehabilitation of the properties.
The Obama administration and Congress have been working on plans to wind down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which the government took over in 2008 as losses on loans guaranteed by the agencies expanded.
Of the 248,000 homes owned by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the F.H.A. at the end of June, 70,000 were listed for sale, said Corinne Russell, a housing finance agency spokeswoman. The remainder were not yet on the market or the agencies had already received an offer from a prospective buyer.
But it is possible that hundreds of thousands of more homes that are now in the foreclosure process could come into the possession of the federal government in the next few years, housing experts say.
''This is a call for innovation and an opportunity for businesses to not only make money and create jobs, but also provide affordable rental housing for those who need it and strengthen our communities at the same time,'' said Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, who has pushed for such a program.
The proposals are at an early stage, and there is no guarantee that any such programs will go forward. After considering the responses to the request for information, which are due by Sept. 15, the entities may issue a request for proposals to put specific programs in place either jointly or separately.
Among the strategies on which the administration is seeking comment are rent-to-own programs, in which previous homeowners or current renters could lease properties as a path to ownership, and ways in which the properties can be used to support affordable housing.

HEADLINE: Another Round of Bailouts?

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Unless there is a clear accounting of the continuing risk from bad loans, and an effort to protect sound governments and companies, policy makers will have limited options in a crisis, an economist writes.

 BODY:
In the wake of recent equity market declines, the clamor for bailouts of various kinds grows ever louder around the world. Influential voices call for "leadership" from the United States and Western Europe, and for policy makers in those countries to "get ahead of the curve." This is all code for a simple and familiar plea: Do something that will protect investors, particularly creditors who have lent a lot of money to banks and countries that now appear to be in serious difficulty.
But providing another round of unconditional creditor bailouts in this situation would be a mistake. What we need is a combination of transparent losses where bad loans were made, combined with a ring-fencing approach that protects sound governments and companies. There is no sign yet that policy makers are willing to make that distinction clear.
The situation around the world is undeniably bad. As Peter Boone and I argued in a Peterson Institute policy paper released a couple of weeks ago, Europe is most definitely "on the brink" of a serious economic crisis that could involve widespread defaults or significant inflation or both. At the same time, Bank of America shares this week fell to their lowest in two years; with other large banks under pressure, there is a legitimate fear of rerunning the parts of the financial crisis of 2008-9. 
The Financial Stability Oversight Council's recently released first annual report does not provide particularly up-to-date numbers, but most of the global warning lights discussed in Chapter 7 must now be flashing red. As recently as 2008-9, there were three kinds of government support available to the American and European economies when such systemic financial trouble hit. But all three traditional forms of bailout are now much harder to pull off.First, over the last 30 years interest-rate cuts and other forms of expansionary monetary policy became standard practice in the face of potential financial market disruption - this is the original meaning of the "Greenspan put." But short-term interest rates are already very low in the United States. The European Central Bank (E.C.B.) has room to cut rates - but both the E.C.B. and the Federal Reserve fear that inflation may soon return. Now, unlike in the fall of 2008, they are reluctant to respond to the latest round of stock market declines with a dramatic easing of monetary policy. 
Second, after the initial monetary policy response in fall 2008, it was fiscal policy that took the lead in preventing global economic free fall - with significant attempts to provide countercyclical stimulus in the United States, much of Western Europe, and China. 
Now the euro zone faces a series of fiscal crises (see my paper with Peter Boone). Further stimulus is out of the question - the issue in Europe is who will do what kind of austerity and how fast.
The fiscal crisis in the United States is more imagined than real. The Standard & Poor's downgrade of long-term United States government debt prompted a huge sell-off - but not in government debt. Investors around the world vote with their feet; they see United States government assets as among the safest available. Still, further fiscal stimulus is most definitely not on the political table in Washington.
And even Chinese fiscal policy shows signs of tightening - as the authorities try to prevent any overheating that could accelerate inflation.
Third, in 2008-9, monetary and fiscal policies were complemented by government capital injections directly into United States and European banks. But these became harder to do under the Dodd-Frank financial reform legislation - unless there is a large-scale systemic approach, which would be very hard to get through this Congress.
The worst financial-sector problems are in Europe. But the recent banking stress tests there were completely unrealistic as they did not include default events that now appear inevitable. To run one set of misleading stress tests (in 2010) might be considered excusable; to do this twice during the same crisis is unconscionable. There is no coherent financial sector policy within the euro zone.
What are the policy options now? The people in charge of European and United States policy would clearly prefer to do nothing or postpone dealing with the underlying issues. This is a bad idea as it puts markets in charge - and these markets are panicked. 
The core to any feasible strategy must be bank capital. As Anat Admati and her colleagues have been arguing, large banks and other financial institutions without sufficient capital are prone to failure - this is what spreads failure and panic far and wide. The Basel III framework, negotiated just last year, is crumbling before our eyes; the failure to ensure sufficient capital is at the heart of the European meltdown - and why the pressure on United States banks is mounting.
The Europeans have to decide, once and for all, which governments will restructure their debts and which will be protected - to an unlimited degree - by the European Central Bank (again, my paper with Peter Boone has more details and proposals). A full-scale bank recapitalization program is required, along with management changes at almost all major European financial institutions. 
If the Europeans fail to get a grip on their economic situation, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation will be pressed to use its Dodd-Frank resolution powers to take over and manage the unwinding of a major American financial institution. In that scenario, creditors are supposed to face losses that are transparent and clearly understood; the theory is that this will stabilize market expectations. The F.D.I.C. has argued that it could have done this in the case of Lehman Brothers. I have my doubts.
The Dodd-Frank reform process decided not to break up global megabanks, but rather to handle them under the F.D.I.C.'s resolution framework. We're about to find out if this was a good idea - or if we are just on the brink of more unconditional bailouts.

HEADLINE: Another Round of Bailouts?

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Unless there is a clear accounting of the continuing risk from bad loans, and an effort to protect sound governments and companies, policy makers will have limited options in a crisis, an economist writes.

 BODY:
In the wake of recent equity market declines, the clamor for bailouts of various kinds grows ever louder around the world. Influential voices call for "leadership" from the United States and Western Europe, and for policy makers in those countries to "get ahead of the curve." This is all code for a simple and familiar plea: Do something that will protect investors, particularly creditors who have lent a lot of money to banks and countries that now appear to be in serious difficulty.
But providing another round of unconditional creditor bailouts in this situation would be a mistake. What we need is a combination of transparent losses where bad loans were made, combined with a ring-fencing approach that protects sound governments and companies. There is no sign yet that policy makers are willing to make that distinction clear.
The situation around the world is undeniably bad. As Peter Boone and I argued in a Peterson Institute policy paper released a couple of weeks ago, Europe is most definitely "on the brink" of a serious economic crisis that could involve widespread defaults or significant inflation or both. At the same time, Bank of America shares this week fell to their lowest in two years; with other large banks under pressure, there is a legitimate fear of rerunning the parts of the financial crisis of 2008-9. 
The Financial Stability Oversight Council's recently released first annual report does not provide particularly up-to-date numbers, but most of the global warning lights discussed in Chapter 7 must now be flashing red.

HEADLINE: Summer College Tours Withstand High Gas and Airline Prices

BYLINE: LILY ALTAVENA


HIGHLIGHT: Families continue to dig a little deeper to get a first-hand glimpse of college campuses.

 BODY:
Despite stubbornly high gas prices and airline fees, many colleges and universities are reporting an increase in visitors this summer compared to last.
Of the 41 colleges that responded recently to an informal e-mail survey by The Choice, nearly three of every four reported an increase in summer visitors -- with some universities experiencing as much as a 50 percent rise.
At Stony Brook University in New York, there has been a 20 percent increase in visits from families of prospective students. According to Stefan Hyman, the web and electronic coordinator, those students who are visiting often express concerns about the economy and cuts to public education.
While more families may be embarking on college tours, they are also being more frugal in their visits. 
"Families are still traveling to visit, but they're doing so a bit more economically in terms of accommodations and logistics," said Alyssa Vine, the associate director of media relations for Barnard College in New York. "In the past, many families might have opted to stay in hotels. Now we often meet guests who are staying with local family or friends while visiting." 
Monica Inzer, the dean of admission and financial aid at Hamilton College in Clinton, N.Y., said that it appeared more families were taking day trips, instead of staying overnight at a local hotel.
This observation was not, however, universal. At the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va., for example, Brian Whitson, the director of university relations, said the college did not notice families traveling more economically.
"This could be in part because of the relative affluence of a large percentage of families in our market,'' he said, "or an indication that many families feel the campus visitation experience is exceedingly important and are continuing to dedicate disposable income to the process of exploring campuses they are considering."
At the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Ashley Memory, the senior director of admissions, said that the university had "taken steps to extend the space for information sessions." The college is also leading tours for specialized schools, like the business school or their science labs, for students interested in a program in science.
Many institutions are also reporting an increase in visitors from out of state, including the University of California at Los Angeles, Stony Brook, Dickinson College in Pennsylvania, and Barnard. Some universities are also reporting an increase in visitors from outside of the United States. At Barnard, in just one recent week, the college said it had hosted prospective students from Brazil, China, Barbados, Lebanon and Wales.
For students who can't afford the trip, many universities are trying to bridge that gap electronically. Harvard College, Cornell University, the University of Chicago and many other top-tier universities offer virtual tours on their Web sites.
"We understand that some families are unable to visit Chicago,'' said Evan Cudworth, the director of content and media at the University of Chicago. "We traditionally visit high schools and college fairs across the country in the spring and fall, but in response to what continues to be a tough economic climate, we've begun hosting information sessions throughout the summer as well so that even families with busy schedules or those living outside of the major metropolitan areas can learn about college opportunities."

HEADLINE: Franc Thoughts on Long-Run Fiscal Issues

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Yes, there are limits. No, they're not relevant right now.

 BODY:
Regular readers of comments will notice a continual stream of criticism from MMT (modern monetary theory) types, who insist that deficits are never a problem as long as you have your own currency. I really don't want to get into that fight right now, because for the time being the MMT people and yours truly are on the same side of the policy debate. Right now it really doesn't matter at all whether the United States issues zero-interest short-term debt or simply prints zero-interest dollar bills, and concern about crowding out is just bad economics.
But we won't always be in a liquidity trap. Someday private demand will be high enough that the Fed will have good reason to raise interest rates above zero, to limit inflation. And when that happens, deficits -- and the perceived willingness of the government to raise enough revenue to cover its spending -- will matter.
I have a specific example that illustrates my point: France in the 1920s, which I wrote about in my dissertation lo these many years ago. Like many nations, France came out of World War I with very large debts, peaking at 240 percent of GDP according to this recent IMF presentation (pdf, slide 17). And France was unable politically to raise enough taxes to cover the cost of servicing that debt. And investors lost confidence in the government's solvency.
Various expedients were tried, including -- late in the game -- creation of monetary base, which was advocated by a finance minister on the (very MMT) grounds that the division of government liabilities between currency and short-term bills made no difference. But it turned out that it did: the franc plunged, and the price level soared.
Now as it turned out this was just what the doctor ordered: because France's budget problem was overwhelmingly the debt overhang rather than current spending, inflation eroded the real value of that debt and made possible the Poincare stabilization of 1926.
So what does this say about the United States? At a future date, when we're out of the liquidity trap, public finances will matter -- and not just because of their role in raising or reducing aggregate demand. The composition of public liabilities as between debt and monetary base does matter in normal times -- hey, if it didn't, the Fed would have no influence, ever. So if we try at that point to finance the deficit by money issue rather than bond sales, it will be inflationary.
And unlike France in the 1920s, such a hypothetical US deficit crisis wouldn't be self-correcting: the biggest source of our long-run deficit isn't the overhang of debt, it's the prospective current cost of paying for retirement, health care, and defense. So such a crisis -- again, it's very much hypothetical -- could spiral into something very nasty, with very high inflation and, yes, hyperinflation.
Now, all of this is remote right now. And notice too that France in the 1920s stabilized with debt of 140 percent of GDP -- far higher than the numbers that are supposed to terrify us now. So none of this is relevant to the current policy debate. 
But since the MMTers seem to have decided to harass those of us who want stronger action now but think there really is a long-run fiscal issue, I needed to put this out there.

HEADLINE: Indians' Winter Event Makes Room for College Hockey

BYLINE: MELISSA HOPPERT


HIGHLIGHT: Progressive Field in Cleveland will host a college hockey game between Ohio State and Michigan during its Snow Days event this winter.

 BODY:
Indians fever has returned to Cleveland this season, something the team hopes to keep burning during the frigid winter months. For the second year in a row, the Indians will host Snow Days, a winter sports wonderland, at Progressive Field.
The most popular features of the event - the Frozen Mile, a quarter-mile ice skating track, and the Batterhorn, a 10-lane tubing hill - will remain, although they will move to make way for what the Indians are calling the crown jewel of this year's festival, a hockey game between Ohio State and Michigan. It will be the first outdoor college hockey game held in Ohio.
The regular-season game, to be held Jan. 15 and called the Frozen Diamond Faceoff, will be a home game for Ohio State, which is about a two-hour drive from Progressive Field and has a rabid fan base in the Cleveland area. That team up north, as Woody Hayes used to say to avoid uttering the word Michigan, is also expected to draw well in a classic rivalry pairing. Michigan set an attendance record for a hockey game in December when it hosted Michigan State in the Big House.
"An event at a venue like Progressive Field is great for both the institutions and the league as a whole," Central Collegiate Hockey Association Commissioner Fred Pletsch said in a statement. "We're looking forward to coming to Cleveland this January to see a terrific rivalry showcased in a distinctive and memorable setting."
The Indians said they expect the capacity to be on par with what it is for baseball games, about 43,000. The team is also hoping to add to that event, much like the Red Sox did when they hosted the Winter Classic between the Boston Bruins and the Philadelphia Flyers in 2010, by hosting youth and high school games, possibly featuring a matchup of the local hockey powers St. Edward and St. Ignatius.
Not that long ago, the Indians, who are two games behind the first-place Detroit Tigers in the American League Central, set an attendance record - later broken by the Red Sox - for consecutive regular-season sellouts. From 1995 to 2001, they had 455 at what was then known as Jacobs Field. But the Indians have not made the playoffs since 2007, and Cleveland has been ravaged by unemployment and population loss. In an effort to get more use, and revenue, out of what would otherwise be a dormant facility, the Indians created Snow Days, which drew more than 50,000 people last year.
"One of the things we're most proud of is we're bringing people into downtown Cleveland at a time when people wouldn't otherwise be there," Mark Shapiro, the team's president, said.
The event will be held from Nov. 25 to Jan. 16. The start of the Batterhorn will move from the bottom of the bleachers to the home run porch in left field and will extend toward center field. The Frozen Mile will navigate around the outfield, while the regulation-size rink will be situated in the infield, covering home plate and stretching down the first-base line.
"We could have had some unfortunate collisions had we left it as it was," Shapiro joked.

HEADLINE: One Way to Close the Sale of a Business

BYLINE: BARBARA TAYLOR


HIGHLIGHT: When buyer and seller can't agree on a price, an earnout can bridge the gap. But the strategy does carry risk.

 BODY:
I once worked with a man whose license plate read BCRE8VE (translation: Be Creative). It was the perfect mantra for a director of advertising - and equally fitting for business owners and deal makers navigating today's business-for-sale marketplace. While there has been a slight uptick in business sales of late, getting a deal done with tight credit markets, depressed valuations and skittish investors continues to require as much art as science.
There's a common saying that buyers will pay you only what your business is worth today. If sales and earnings at your company were stellar three years ago but have since dropped off, the buyer is not going to value your business at the previous year's level. If your business has the potential for growth in the coming years, particularly in the hands of a strategic acquirer, then a buyer may indeed pay you for that future value - but don't expect the payment today. Instead, be prepared to understand and structure an earnout, a contingency payment that is based on the future performance of the business.
A flexible tool that can be used in combination with other terms of a sale to arrive at a mutually agreeable price, an earnout can serve a number of purposes, including making up the difference between what the seller wants and what the buyer is willing to pay, backing up seller claims about future growth opportunities, and balancing out perceived risk.
Earnouts are used frequently in the sale of high-tech and service businesses like CoActive Consulting Group, a 15-person firm that installed and automated software systems at companies throughout New England and that JaneJohnson and her partners sold in 2004. At first, when a buyer put in a weak initial offer, the deal looked like a nonstarter. But then Ms. Johnson started thinking creatively. 
"Rather than give up, I built a spreadsheet that showed the synergies between our companies and future revenue and profits we could make together," said Ms. Johnson, who started CoActive in 1990 to give herself a more flexible schedule while starting a family. After working with the buyer, a Boston-based accounting firm with more than 250 employees, on several consulting assignments, Ms. Johnson and her partners were confident the two companies would be a good fit. "I was determined to make this deal work," she recalled.
Most earnouts involve structured payments to the seller that are tied to milestones like gross sales, gross profit or net income, with a typical term of one to five years. "We agreed on the assumptions for the spreadsheet and successfully negotiated an earnout based on both new business as well as recurring revenue from our existing customer list on the date of the sale," Ms. Johnson said of CoActive's earnout. "It was based on gross consulting revenue and software margin, not the buyer's bottom line. We did not want to be penalized for their overhead spending."
Earnouts work well for the sale of a business whose primary stakeholders are willing to stay on and ensure that the agreed-upon milestones are achieved. "I knew that I could put aside my ego and work for someone, at least for a few years," said Ms. Johnson, who was CoActive's chief executive. "I had worked successfully in larger organizations in the past, so I knew I could do it." Each of CoActive's partners had a five-year employment agreement, although the agreement was not contingent on the partners staying on. After selling CoActive, the partners received payments from the buyer every six months for the next five years.
Earnouts have become particularly relevant during the recent economic downturn, as they can also be useful for businesses that have experienced a downward trend in revenues - a situation that many business owners now face. One of the disadvantages of selling your business is that you forgo any benefit from the company's future growth. An earnout can facilitate a sale today, while allowing the seller to enjoy some of the upside that comes with improved economic conditions. Earnouts can also minimize the tax consequences associated with the sale of a business (be sure to discuss the tax consequences of any deal structure with your advisers early in the negotiation process).
Setting up an earnout does involve certain risks. Chief among these are delaying payment in full, reliance on the buyer's operational skills, and the prospect of unanticipated disputes surrounding the earnout's structure and payout. Business owners should try to strike a balance between the potential risks and rewards. "We realized a much larger payout than we could have ever received if we took all cash up front," said Ms. Johnson, who received the majority of the sales price of CoActive through the contingency. "We decided to shoulder most of the risk, and it paid off."
Since selling her business, Ms. Johnson has been specializing in exit- and transition-planning for business owners.

HEADLINE: Insurance Premiums Vary Widely Across States

BYLINE: REED ABELSON


HIGHLIGHT: Wide swings in coverage and premiums.

 BODY:
The Kaiser Family Foundation has come out with a new analysis that shows just how much the cost of health insurance for individuals varies from state to state.
 If you live in Massachusetts or Vermont, the average monthly premium topped $400 a month in 2010, compared with just $136 a month in Alabama. The average across the country was $215 per month.
The authors of the analysis point out that some expensive states have higher insurance premiums because they make it easier for people with potentially expensive pre-existing conditions to get coverage.
The authors believe that the new federal health care law will probably reduce the variation in premiums, although they note that a state's cost of living and overall cost of health care also contribute to the differences in premiums.

HEADLINE: On the Road, and Out of the Red

BYLINE: LISA MARGONELLI


HIGHLIGHT: A non-profit group has found that helping people get low-interest loans for more efficient cars can improve lives.

 BODY:
In March 2010, Tammy Trahan's 1993 Jeep Cherokee broke down on one of the New Hampshire back roads that made up her 90-mile daily commute. "I was in tears," says Tammy, "I wanted to drive into the river." As a single mom, the car was her lifeline, taking her to the job that kept her and her family barely afloat. But the car was also dragging her down. Because a bad divorce had left her with terrible credit, she'd paid such high interest rates that the car with a $9000 sticker price when she bought it seven years earlier ended up costing her $20,000 in payments. She'd also paid many thousands of dollars in repair charges. Gasoline for the behemoth cost her as much as $500 a month. Despite the fact that she worked full time and had as many as four side jobs, she had no savings at all, and the latest breakdown meant she'd be late for work again. On that cold morning by the side of the road Trahan despaired: "I was afraid I'd be in the same rut forever."
Cut to July 2011: Trahan now drives a 2010 Toyota Yaris, spending about $120 a month on gasoline for her commute and $297 for car payments. Her repair bills are near zero. She doesn't fear losing her job and her kids can depend on her to show up when she says she will. "When you're not stressing out so much over everything you can see more, too."

In addition to changing her life, Trahan has also changed her footprint on the planet: Her new car uses less gasoline and emits less carbon than her old one. And now that Trahan's credit is repaired and she's saving more than $300 a month, she plans to leave her current apartment to rent one closer to work so she can cut her long commute - and her oil dependence - even further.
What made the difference was a relatively small thing: a low -interest auto loan offered by an innovative New Hampshire-based non-profit called More Than Wheels. Founded in 2001 by two former auto salesmen, Robert Chambers and Leo Hamill, More Than Wheels helps households repair their credit and then buy new or high quality used cars with loans of 3.5 to 5.5 percent interest. Over the five-year life of the loan More Than Wheels (formerly known as Bonnie CLAC) helps their clients keep their credit ratings high, which allows them to make choices for financial stability. "The car is a catalyst for behavior change," said the group's chief executive Terri Steingrebe. The point of the project, Steingrebe says, is to give families lasting control over their destiny. Over the past 10 years, only five percent of More Than Wheels clients have defaulted on their loans - a rate well below the industry average
Since its founding More Than Wheels has helped about 1450 families buy better cars, saving them thousands of dollars in interest and repairs. And because the organization always gets people into more fuel efficient vehicles, they estimate the program has reduced carbon emissions by more than 52,000 tons over the 10-year lifespan of the cars it helped to finance.
Usually, when we talk about addressing big problems like oil dependence, climate change and stagnant wages, we talk about big fixes: high speed rail, electric cars, and climate change bills for the former; federally funded business loans or education programs for the latter. We don't talk about little, personal things like auto loans. But we should: The auto's all-consuming role in American life gives it extraordinary leverage in both the economy and the environment.
More Than Wheels got its start in New Hampshire, where there is little public transportation, and residents are highly dependent upon their cars. The state's ruggedly individualist bent also probably shaped the program, which is hardly a handout. Clients of More Than Wheels receive many services, but significantly, they pay for them. When Trahan first heard about More Than Wheels she needed to be screened to see if her credit could be repaired. Assured she'd be accepted into the program, she had to pay an application fee of $60. Once accepted, she enrolled in an online course in finance and mending her credit. She learned to be more financially resourceful, using Freecycle and other online resources to avoid spending. With a counselor, she looked up her credit scores and worked out a strategy to pay off her old debts. (In the meantime More Than Wheels gave her a "bridge car" - a used Honda - to drive to and from work. (She had to pay $300 a month for the car and sold the Jeep to the mechanic who had fixed it over the years for $500.) When she'd been paying off her debts for six months (other conditions include holding the same job and living in the same place) she became eligible for a car loan.
While auto loans are generally "free" in the marketplace (of course you pay for them in interest) More Than Wheels requires that clients pay a fee of $895, though they do not need to put down a down payment on the car. Then the organization works with the client to decide what new car (or a used car in good condition) will best suit their needs. More Than Wheels negotiates the purchase price, arranges for a low-interest auto loan with local lenders, and arranges a maintenance policy. When clients drive the car off the lot, they're usually paying no more per month than they were with their previous car, but they've got a lot more car for their money. They're also obligated to follow a maintenance schedule and participate in regular check ins about their credit score. "We're very personal. We stay with clients for the length of the loan - 66 months. If something happens and they lose their job and want to get rid of their car, we resell it. We're confident it will never be upside down," said Steingrebe.
More Than Wheels is a relatively small program and has only begun monitoring its impacts recently, but data collected by the Carsey Institute at the University of New Hampshire suggests that its impact goes well beyond getting a family in a car. As you'd expect, three quarters of participants said they paid less for car repairs, and a similar number said their finances were in better shape. But more than half also said that because of the money they saved each month they had better access to health care and nearly 4 in 10 said they had more access to nutritious food.
When you get down into the details, More Than Wheels doesn't do anything particularly fancy: It offers good loans on good cars to people who've shown they're committed to paying their bills. In theory, that's what a local bank would do. The reason More Than Wheels works so well is that it's nothing like the low end of the auto credit market, which is a perilous jungle.
People with good credit can walk into a car dealership and be courted with a mixture of hot dogs, balloons and low-A.P.R. loans. People with bad credit and cash on hand tend to buy used cars from the classifieds or Craigslist. People with poor credit and little cash - and there are many of them these days - go to used car lots, some of which are called "buy here, pay here." These dealers sell used cars with very high financing rates, and if the borrower misses a payment they often reclaim the car immediately. (You can read more about their practices here.) More Than Wheels estimates that a 2001 Ford Explorer with more than 80,000 miles, with a sticker price of $6000 at most, purchased at a buy-here-pay-here lot will require a down payment of $2195, and a monthly payment of nearly $300 for five years, which works out to an interest rate of more than 30 percent and a cost of more than $20,000 for a car worth far less.
Many buyers, like Tammy Trahan, agree to the terms because the monthly payment is relatively low, and it's their only option. Trahan also was led to believe she'd be able to repair her credit. In fact, the buy-here-pay-here industry itself estimates that its default rate is around 30 percent - it's virtually part of the business model. "It's really a cycle of bad car after bad car," says Steingrebe. "The car is necessary to keep money coming in but it keeps the family in a cycle of poverty."
When gas prices are high, the whole cycle kicks into overdrive. High gas prices increase the price of more efficient cars, which puts them out of reach of struggling buyers. Worse, though, high gas prices lower the prices of the least efficient cars - making them more likely to end up in the hands of those who can least afford the gas. (And many working families have more than one part-time job, which just lengthens their commute.)
Also, when gas prices are high, most families scrimp on everything but gas. "I had to save every penny for gas because gas got me to work and paid for the roof over our heads," says Trahan. Gas took precedence over food - which meant the family ate peanut butter and jelly or macaroni and cheese. In the summer of 2008 high gas prices meant her son didn't do football and soccer at the local high school. Worse, financial pressures caused by the car lead her to take risks she shouldn't have. Trahan dropped her auto insurance - which is something you can do in New Hampshire. Fortunately she didn't have an accident. Less successful was her decision to cut back on her asthma medicine, which lead to two trips to the emergency room. "It's amazing how much gas can affect your life," says Trahan.
A simple, fair auto loan can change everything from one family's dinner menu to greenhouse gas emissions, but can a program like this expand? More Than Wheels is still small, and next week I'll discuss some of the challenges they're facing as they try to grow. I'll also talk about how federal and state governments might encourage loan programs like this. And does an auto loan program make sense as a "green" initiative? It's certainly a lot cheaper than the amount we away to people who buy cutting-edge cars like the Prius and Chevy Volt, not to mention the massive giveaways in the 2009 Cash For Clunkers program. Both of those programs, by the way, are aimed at people with cash on hand and good credit. Tammy Trahan never would have stood a chance.

HIGHLIGHT: Britain didn't remain neutral because of the cotton trade, but because Secretary of State Seward pushed it away.

 BODY:
One of the more common misconceptions about the Civil War is that the world (meaning Europe and, in particular, Britain) favored a Southern victory because of its dependence on cotton. The economic data appears to provide incontrovertible evidence: the livelihood of one in five Britons was connected in some way to the textile trade. 
But, while admittedly a powerful motivator in foreign reactions to the war, cotton was not king. In fact, during the first four months of the conflict, when Britain's response to secession was still maturing, the South's threat to withhold cotton until its independence was recognized caused far less anxiety than the bellicose threats emanating from the Union's secretary of state, William Henry Seward. One of the great tragedies of the Civil War is that Secretary Seward's crass resort to "spread eagle nationalism" at the beginning of the conflict turned Britain from being potentially decisive ally into a hostile neutral.
In April 1861 it was well known among the expatriate circles in Washington that the British minister, Lord Lyons, was "strong for the Union." But at that moment, Seward could not or would not see the signals. Tormented by his declining political influence over President Lincoln, Seward became obsessed with reasserting his once legendary authority in Washington. One byproduct of the Secretary's inner turmoil was a bizarre memorandum delivered to Lincoln's office on April 1, which argued that a foreign war was the only salvation for the Union. Seward proposed to reunite the country by creating an external threat - in his words, to "change the question before the Public from one upon Slavery ... to one of Patriotism or Union."
Lincoln dismissed the proposal, but somehow its broad contents became known to the diplomatic community. Worse was to follow. The Republican-dominated Congress had just passed a series of highly punitive import taxes on European goods, known as the Morrill Act, with no thought about how such economic warfare would be regarded abroad. Soon after came the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, and Lincoln's declaration that all Southern ports were under a federal blockade.
Both these developments required careful handling by the State Department. But instead of reassuring the diplomatic community, Seward was aggressively dismissive about the Morrill Act, and careless to the point of fatally negligent with regard to the legalities of the blockade. Neither the American legations abroad, for example, nor the diplomatic community in Washington was given advance warning of its implementation. Ministers who called at the State Department to discuss the situation met with threats and insults from Seward. Lord Lyons was told that if he wished to maintain peace with America he must refrain from describing Southern secession as a civil war. Diplomats were left wondering who was the real target of Washington's aggression.
The French minister, Henri Mercier, urged his colleagues to ignore the blockade, but Lyons vigorously lobbied against the idea, pointing out that such a blatant act would "entail utter ruin upon the [Northern] Administration and their supporters." Lyons wished he could have gone further; however, after another blistering confrontation with Seward, he wrote on May 6: "I confess I can see no better policy for us than a strict impartiality for the present The sympathies of an Englishman are naturally inclined towards the North - but I am afraid we should find that anything like a quasi-alliance with the men in office here, would place us in a position which would soon become untenable ... my feeling against Slavery might lead me to desire to co-operate with them. But I conceive all chance of this to be gone for ever."
If Seward does not "pick a quarrel with us," wrote Lyons on another occasion, it would not be because "of the insanity which doing so at this crisis ... would seem to indicate." He thought Seward had no intention of "conciliating the European Powers or at all events of not forcing them into hostility." British newspapers reached the same conclusion after Seward allowed William Howard Russell, a correspondent for the London Times, to see his latest message to the British foreign secretary: "The tone of the paper was hostile," reported Russell, "there was an undercurrent of menace through it, and it contained insinuations that Great Britain would interfere to split up the Republic, if she could, and was pleased at the prospect of the dangers which threatened it."
When these developments became known in England, even pro-Northern journals like the Spectator magazine complained, "The Americans are, for the moment, transported beyond the influence of common sense. With all of England sympathising, more or less heartily, with the North, they persist in regarding her as an enemy, and seem positively anxious to change an ally ... into an open and dangerous foe." The pro-Northern journalist and social reformer Harriet Martineau blamed Seward for having allowed the passage of the Morrill tariff, since the bill was practically "inviting the world to support the Confederate cause." The New York banker August Belmont heard the complaints first-hand; during an unsuccessful visit to England to drum up interest in Union bonds, he was repeatedly asked to justify Congress's attack on British trade. Primer Minister Lord Palmerston told him at a private meeting: "We do not like slavery, but we want cotton, and we dislike very much your Morrill tariff."
Seward's discovery that his actions had led to British reluctance to do business with the North, let alone provide military or moral support, came as a rude shock to him. Two days before the Battle of Bull Run, on July 19, the secretary paid a private visit to the British legation. He "proceeded, with some hesitation," reported Lord Lyons, "and with an injunction to me to be secret," to explain "that he had used strong language in his earlier communications to Foreign Powers ... from the necessity of making them clearly understand the state of Public Feeling here." Seward added that his only motive had been to prevent disunion, not begin a foreign war. "I was not altogether unprepared for the change in Mr Seward's tone," Lyons admitted, having heard from the French legation that Seward had made a similar speech to Mercier a few hours earlier. 
The change in Seward's approach did not long survive the Confederate victory at Bull Run. In September, Lyon informed London that Seward was once again whipping up a public storm against Britain. "If he is in his present mood, he will be glad to find a pretext for performing other half-violent acts." But, Lyons added despondently, "this cannot go on forever." Some incident, he predicted, would push the war of words into a war of arms. Two months later Capt. Charles Wilkes instigated such an incident when he dragged two Confederate envoys off the Trent, a British mail boat bound for England, and took them back to Boston. London issued an ultimatum: the Confederates' release, or war.
It is important to stress that as the Civil War progressed, myriad factors affected the North's relationship with Britain. Moreover, Seward transformed over the four years to become the single most important instrument for peace between the two countries. But his early mistakes cost the Union dear. The trajectory of the war would have been quite different if, from the outset, Washington and London had been allied and agreed on a joint policy to prevent the South from using British ports, credit and war materiel. In the early months, as Charles Francis Adams Jr., the son of the American minister to London, later wrote, Seward had "found himself fairly beyond his depth; and he plunged! The foreign-war panacea took possession of him; and he yielded to it."

HIGHLIGHT: Audi plans a mini-E.V. for Frankfurt, a battery manufacturer wins a crucial contract from General Motors and Ford partners with a solar-charging company for its Focus Electric.

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Ahead of the Frankfurt auto show, which begins in September, Audi teased an electric urban-runabout concept this week. The car, which makes use of carbon-fiber reinforced polymer to maintain low weight and increase rigidity, has 1-plus-1 seating, with a passenger seat positioned behind the driver. A lithium-ion battery supplies power to two electric motors, which Audi brands under its e-tron banner. In the style of a Caterham 7, the wheels are positioned outside the fuselage. (Audi)
 A123 Systems, the Massachusetts battery manufacturer, has won a contract to provide General Motors with battery packs for an undisclosed number of vehicles to be sold in select global markets. According to a report by The Associated Press, the packs will be produced at the battery manufacturer's plant in Livonia, Mich. LG Chem, which also maintains a plant in Michigan, provides the lithium-ion pack used in the Chevrolet Volt and its European equivalent, the Opel Ampera. (General Motors)
 Ford announced Wednesday that it would join with SunPower, a solar-power infrastructure company, to provide home-charging units for buyers of the automaker's coming Focus Electric and other planned plug-in models, like the C-Max. Pricing for the rooftop solar array, including assessment and installation, would begin at $10,000, but would not include the 240-volt home-charging unit that Ford intends to sell at Best Buy. SunPower estimates that the system delivers sufficient energy to fuel 1,000 miles of monthly, grid-free driving. (Ford)
 Better Place, the electric-vehicle infrastructure company, opened its first retail store in Israel this week. In March, outside of Copenhagen, the company opened its first shop, and the country's first battery-swap station followed last month. (That system was recently tested by Bradley Berman in The Times.) Like the Denmark store, the new location in Israel serves as a demonstration center, where prospective customers can test drive the Renault Fluence Z.E., the only mass-produced vehicle available that is designed for quick battery swaps. (Ha'aretz)
Ron Bloom, President Obama's auto czar, announced that he would leave the position at the end of August. Mr. Bloom joined the president's auto industry task force in February 2009 and was involved in organizing the bailouts and subsequent bankruptcies of Chrysler and General Motors later that year. As noted by The Times, Mr. Bloom also was instrumental in orchestrating discussions among major automakers about the latest round of Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards, which call for companies to achieve a fleet average of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.

HEADLINE: As Ecosystems, Cities Yield Some Surprises

BYLINE: HILLARY ROSNER


HIGHLIGHT: Twenty-one federally financed projects are under way to understand urban water use, greenhouse gas emissions, storm water runoff and biodiversity.

 BODY:
In Boston, scientists measuring the city's greenhouse gas emissions have found what they call a "weekend effect," a clear drop-off in the amount of carbon dioxide entering the city's atmosphere on Saturdays and Sundays. In Fresno, researchers have discovered that backyard water use increases with wealth, as does backyard biodiversity. And in Los Angeles, ecologists studying the city's "ecohydrology" have calculated that planting a million new trees, an idea with fairly universal appeal, would have the drawback of increasing water consumption by 5 percent.
The researchers, who presented their findings this week at the Ecological Society of America's annual meeting in Austin, Tex., are all involved in a nascent program to understand the nation's cities, home to 80 percent of the population, as functioning ecosystems. The goal is to educate urbanites about their environment and how they can act to make it more sustainable. 
The program, called Ultra, for Urban Long-Term Research Area, is a joint effort of the National Science Foundation and the Forest Service. A total of 21 projects are under way, including two in New York City. In established financing (known as Ultra-Ex grants) for exploratory sites in 2009, the science foundation called urban sustainability one of "the greatest challenges to the long-term environmental quality of the nation." 
At the site in Fresno, Calif., overseen by Madhusudan Katti, an ecologist at California State University's campus there, the aim is to untangle the interactions between city water policy, outdoor water use at homes and biodiversity to help inform policy. On the average, wealthier households in Fresno use more water in their yards, yet not because the water is more affordable for them: the city has no metering system, so residents pay a fixed monthly rate. 
Reducing water use is considered crucial to guaranteeing long-term sustainability, yet Dr. Katti found that using less water could cause local bird diversity to decline. 
"Half the population globally lives in cities, but we don't have a conceptual understanding of how cities work as dynamic systems," Dr. Katti said. "We need to generate that understanding."
Nathan Phillips, an ecologist at Boston University who runs one of the city's two Ultra-Ex sites, told the audience at the conference that his project, which includes rooftop plant experiments both in and outside the city as well as measurements of greenhouse gases, had revealed a "pulsing type of urban metabolism." 
In a visible signature of human activity, emissions of carbon dioxide increase during the week and decline on the weekends, he said. The next step is putting sensors on 160 Boston buses and identifying the locations of natural gas leaks around the city.
In New York City, one Ultra-Ex project based at Columbia's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory is exploring links between public health, green spaces, and ecosystem services, or nature's ability to perform functions like cleaning the air and water or preventing flooding. The project is studying seven green roofs, including one at the main post office building on Eighth Avenue in Manhattan, to understand their role in preventing sewage from spilling into the city's waterways during heavy rains.
Some Ultra-Ex projects have a social justice component. In Syracuse, the research helped prevent the installation of a sewage pipe in a low-income neighborhood. Scientists were able to show that installing features like green roofs and porous pavements could reduce storm water runoff. 
Just as these research sites are beginning to reveal how such urban ecosystems function, federal budget cuts are calling their future into question. At the ecology meeting, a few dozen Ultra researchers met to discuss how to merge their independent projects into a more closely knit network with an online hub, with or without a central financing source. Cities, after all, will still live and breathe and eat and sweat regardless of what happens in Washington -- where there is, by the way, an Ultra-Ex site researching the environmental factors that cause neighborhoods to decline or flourish.

HEADLINE: Once Scorned, Compact Fluorescents Are Advancing

BYLINE: BOB TEDESCHI


HIGHLIGHT: Despite some mercury content, budget-conscious consumers can take solace in the fact that some groups consider C.F.L.'s greener than the bulbs they replace.

 BODY:
In my Pragmatist column in Thursday's Home section, I describe the latest advancements in energy-efficient light bulbs in response to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, part of which takes effect next January.
Much of that discussion focuses on so-called C.F.L.'s, or compact fluorescent light bulbs. While they have improved in recent years, the technology continues to be hampered by worries about its environmental impact in landfills because C.F.L.'s contain mercury.
Environmentally minded consumers who hope to shave a few dollars from their electric bills by using C.F.L.'s can take solace in the fact that some groups consider C.F.L.'s greener than the bulbs they replace.
In 2008, for instance, the National Resources Defense Council published a paper suggesting that C.F.L.'s do less environmental harm than standard incandescent bulbs.

For example, C.F.L.'s require one-quarter the energy from coal-fired power plants that incandescents do, the council wrote. If all consumers changed to C.F.L.'s, the group argued, those plants would send less pollution into the air. The council's paper cites research by the Northeast Waste Management Officials' Association into toxic waste levels from C.F.L.'s. 
If you choose to buy fluorescents, you'll still need to dispose of your old C.F.L.'s properly when they die or break. Home Depot and Lowe's both accept C.F.L.'s for recycling, and you can find more information about disposal locations, among other topics, here.
Safety, of course, is another issue, since light bulbs are so easy to break. The amount of mercury contained in a C.F.L. is roughly equivalent to the amount of ink on the tip of a ballpoint pen and about one-fifth the amount in a watch battery, the council's paper says. But the bulbs can leak mercury vapor when broken, so ventilation is important when cleaning a broken bulb, the council says in its paper.
Some manufacturers now produce C.F.L.'s with protective coating; the EcoSmart Shatter-Resistant C.F.L. is one example.
So for those proceeding with caution on C.F.L.'s, the light is now green.

HEADLINE: Aug. 11, 1965 | Riots in the Watts Section of Los Angeles

BYLINE: THE LEARNING NETWORK


HIGHLIGHT: On Aug. 11, 1965, in southern California, rioting broke out in the primarily black neighborhood of Watts.

 BODY:
On Aug. 11, 1965, rioting broke out in the primarily black neighborhood of Watts in Los Angeles. The violence was sparked by false rumors of police brutality during a traffic stop, though the root causes were long simmering racial tension and anger over poor living conditions.
In theAug. 12 New York Times, Peter Bart reported: "In one instance a Molotov cocktail was tossed at a car driven by a white man, who was then dragged out and beaten. 'This is no place for white men,' a Negro youth was heard to warn him. Most of the damage has been to Negro stores and automobiles. 'It's a race riot and yet it isn't,' one weary young officer commented after one foray. 'I saw them stone a Negro's car and then beat him up.'"
The riots continued for six days, leaving 34 people dead, more than 1,000 injured and more than 600 buildings destroyed.
The state's investigation in California into the riots put attention on the conditions in Watts and other black ghettos in Los Angeles. The report recommended many measures to improve conditions, but most were not acted on.
The Watts riots were one of the largest urban race riots of the 1960s, and marked a shift from the nonviolence of the civil rights movement. Many people view the riots as a positive development; for them, the Watts riots represent "a revolt, a rebellion, an uprising - a violent but justified leap into a future of black self-empowerment," according to Valerie Reitman and Mitchell Landsberg of The Los Angeles Times.
Others believe that the shift toward violence held back the advancement of blacks in America. "The new mood that the Watts riots inaugurated was a tragedy for black America," says John McWhorter, "dragging poor blacks into depths of malaise they might never have known otherwise."

Do you think rioting can be an effective means to advocate change? What protests, riots or other political uprisings around the globe have been in the news this year? What do you think they have in common with the Watts riots of 1965?
In a post on the Economix blog during the protests in Egypt this past February, Edward L. Glaeser lists examples of political uprisings throughout history, including the Watts riots, and concludes that one thing they have in common is that they all originated in urban areas. Cities, he writes, "aren't just places of economic productivity and cultural innovation. For millennia, they have also been the epicenters of dramatic political upheaval."
These uprisings aren't just accidentally urban; they would be unthinkable at low densities. Cities connect agitators, like Sam Adams and John Hancock. Riots require a certain kind of urban congestion; police power must be overwhelmed by a sea of humanity.
Do you think this is true? How do the riots in Britain this week fit this description? How do they compare with the Watts riots?

HEADLINE: Kelley Blue Book Says Used-Car Prices Are Expected to Remain High for Years

BYLINE: MICHELINE MAYNARD


HIGHLIGHT: The price-tracking service forecasts a sustained period of high prices for used cars that may last two to three years.

 BODY:
With used-car prices at historic highs, customers hoping for those prices to decline may have to wait years for a reprieve.
Prices for used cars are likely to stay high for the next two to three years, according to a report released Thursday by Kelley Blue Book, which tracks new- and used-car prices.
The service attributes the sustained strength of used-car prices to a gradual decline in new-car sales dating to 2008, as well as a drop in the number of leased cars becoming available at the end of their contract terms.
The report said that the price of the average one- to three-year-old used vehicle was rising 15.8 percent per year. In 2008, the average cost of a one- to three-year-old vehicle was $15,042, but now the average is $23,353, according to the report.
Many in the industry, Kelley Blue Book included, had claimed that used-car prices peaked late this spring. Forecasters had said that healthier new-car inventories, aided by the recovery of production capacity in Japan after the March earthquake and tsunami, as well as lower fuel prices, would lead to a sales uptick in showrooms and, subsequently, more trade-ins and private sales of used cars.
But showroom sales remain sluggish, and analysts now are concerned that volatility in the financial markets and sustained high unemployment may encourage potential buyers to hang on to their vehicles rather than buy new ones.
Daniel F. Akerson, the chairman and chief executive of General Motors, expressed skepticism earlier this week that total new-car sales, across brands, in the United States this year would reach the company's forecast of 13 million vehicles. July sales suggested an annual selling rate of about 12.2 million units.
For those who can afford to part with their cars, particularly compact and midsize models, the selling environment is optimal.
Manheim Consulting, which follows used-car sales, says the average price of a small carrose 16.7 percent in July compared with the same period a year ago, while the average price of a midsize car was up nearly 12 percent.

HEADLINE: Financial District Turning Governmental, Study Finds

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: A report from the Alliance for Downtown New York found that city, state and federal agencies now combine to employ more people south of Chambers Street than any other industry.

 BODY:
Lower Manhattan, long considered the financial district of New York City, might more aptly be known as the government district, a new report from the Alliance for Downtown New York shows.
The report, released on Thursday, found that city, state and federal agencies combine to employ more people south of Chambers Street than any other industry does. That marks a shift from the days before the World Trade Center was destroyed, prompting several large financial firms to move much or all of their operations to Midtown.
Some have stayed, including American Express and the Goldman Sachs investment bank, but financial services companies accounted for just 28 percent of the 309,500 jobs in Lower Manhattan, according to the report. The government sector, including City Hall, courthouses and Police Headquarters, employed about one-third of all the workers there, as it has for the last six years.
As recently as 2004, financial services was the biggest industry in Lower Manhattan, accounting for about 115,000 jobs. But since then, the district has lost almost 30,000 financial jobs.
Some of that void has been filled by new arrivals, notably media companies and nonprofit organizations, taking advantage of big vacancies and, in many cases, lower rents than they could find in Midtown, the report shows. More recently, companies like Conde Nast have agreed to move downtown to expensive new space in the rebuilt World Trade Center.
Over all, the number of jobs downtown is still about 15,000 lower than it was before the Sept. 11 terrorist attack. But employment there has grown over the past decade in several industries, including professional services like law firms, and in education and social services, the report shows.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: 2008?

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
In Today's Times: 
Is it 2008 all over again? With the United States economic recovery faltering, financial markets jittery and politicians in Washington sharply divided, concerns about a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis are growing. Nelson Schwartz spoke to economists and market experts, who generally agreed that the risks of an immediate crisis are lower today. But, he says, they didn't rule out a quick downward spiral if politicians in the United States and in Europe can't calm investors by addressing fundamental problems.
In the United States, growing deficits rank high among those problems. Republican leaders named six more lawmakers on Wednesday to join a 12-member special committee to come up with a plan to trim federal deficits by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. Robert Pear reports on the likely alliances and dynamics based on the panel's membership so far. Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, is expected to name the final three Democratic members by Tuesday.
With hundreds of thousands of foreclosed properties on the books, the federal government is considering becoming a landlord. Ed Wyatt writes that the Obama administration is soliciting ideas for how to turn the federal government's inventory of foreclosed houses into rental properties that could be managed by private enterprises or sold in bulk. The goal is to stabilize neighborhoods blighted by foreclosure and clean up the government's balance sheets.
Despite a growing threat from militant Islamists in Somalia, the United States has outsourced the fight against extremists there to private security companies and African troops, Mark Mazzetti, Eric Schmitt and Jeffrey Gettleman write. The reporters explain how the American strategy in Somalia has been hobbled by neglect, poor financing and internal government battles, according to dozens of intelligence and counterterrorism officials. They describe a government at a standstill, alarmed about a threat but unable to agree on a coherent policy to address it.
On the campaign trail, Mitt Romney descended on Iowa on Wednesday, four years after Republicans there helped dash his first White House bid. His return is complicated by the expected candidacy of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, according to Jeff Zeleny and Ashley Parker. The two write that Republican strategists have urged Mr. Romney to wage a strong campaign in Iowa if he hopes to avoid ceding victories to Mr. Perry in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries.
Around the Web:
The Wall Street Journal evaluates the internal divisions at the Federal Reserve that were exposed this week by three members' no votes on a decision to ease monetary policy.
A majority of voters don't believe policy makers can solve the country's economic problems, according to a Washington Post poll.
At The Atlantic, Joshua Green argues that the deficit panel's negotiations should be kept private to limit the influence of special interests.
The Republican presidential candidates are expected to meet Thursday in Iowa for a debate hosted by Fox News. The event comes just two days before the Iowa straw poll ranks the candidates.
Happening in Washington:Economic date expected today include weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. from the Department of Labor and weekly mortgage rates at 11 from Freddie Mac.
Also at 11, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton discusses the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa at the International Food Policy Research Institute.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: 2008?

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times and around the Web, plus a look at what's happening in Washington.

 BODY:
In Today's Times: 
Is it 2008 all over again? With the United States economic recovery faltering, financial markets jittery and politicians in Washington sharply divided, concerns about a repeat of the 2008 financial crisis are growing. Nelson Schwartz spoke to economists and market experts, who generally agreed that the risks of an immediate crisis are lower today. But, he says, they didn't rule out a quick downward spiral if politicians in the United States and in Europe can't calm investors by addressing fundamental problems.
In the United States, growing deficits rank high among those problems. Republican leaders named six more lawmakers on Wednesday to join a 12-member special committee to come up with a plan to trim federal deficits by $1.5 trillion over 10 years. Robert Pear reports on the likely alliances and dynamics based on the panel's membership so far. Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader, is expected to name the final three Democratic members by Tuesday.
With hundreds of thousands of foreclosed properties on the books, the federal government is considering becoming a landlord. Ed Wyatt writes that the Obama administration is soliciting ideas for how to turn the federal government's inventory of foreclosed houses into rental properties that could be managed by private enterprises or sold in bulk. The goal is to stabilize neighborhoods blighted by foreclosure and clean up the government's balance sheets.
Despite a growing threat from militant Islamists in Somalia, the United States has outsourced the fight against extremists there to private security companies and African troops, Mark Mazzetti, Eric Schmitt and Jeffrey Gettleman write. The reporters explain how the American strategy in Somalia has been hobbled by neglect, poor financing and internal government battles, according to dozens of intelligence and counterterrorism officials. They describe a government at a standstill, alarmed about a threat but unable to agree on a coherent policy to address it.
On the campaign trail, Mitt Romney descended on Iowa on Wednesday, four years after Republicans there helped dash his first White House bid. His return is complicated by the expected candidacy of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas, according to Jeff Zeleny and Ashley Parker. The two write that Republican strategists have urged Mr. Romney to wage a strong campaign in Iowa if he hopes to avoid ceding victories to Mr. Perry in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries.
Around the Web:
The Wall Street Journal evaluates the internal divisions at the Federal Reserve that were exposed this week by three members' no votes on a decision to ease monetary policy.
A majority of voters don't believe policy makers can solve the country's economic problems, according to a Washington Post poll.
At The Atlantic, Joshua Green argues that the deficit panel's negotiations should be kept private to limit the influence of special interests.
The Republican presidential candidates are expected to meet Thursday in Iowa for a debate hosted by Fox News. The event comes just two days before the Iowa straw poll ranks the candidates.
Happening in Washington:Economic date expected today include weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m. from the Department of Labor and weekly mortgage rates at 11 from Freddie Mac.
Also at 11, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton discusses the humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa at the International Food Policy Research Institute.

HEADLINE: Two Views on the British Riots

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Welfare-state mobs, or the logical endpoint of Tea Party-esque policies?

 BODY:
From yesterday's Times op-ed page, Richard Sennett and Saskia Sassen:
... The American right today is obsessed with cutting government spending. In many ways, Mr. Cameron's austerity program is the Tea Party's dream come true. But Britain is now grappling with the consequences of those cuts, which have led to the neglect and exclusion of many vulnerable, disaffected young people who are acting out violently and irresponsibly - driven by rage rather than an explicit political agenda.
America is in many ways different from Britain, but the two countries today are alike in their extremes of inequality, and in the desire of many politicians to solve economic and social ills by reducing the power of the state.
Britain's current crisis should cause us to reflect on the fact that a smaller government can actually increase communal fear and diminish our quality of life. Is that a fate America wishes upon itself?
From Brendan O'Neill, the editor of Spiked Online:
What we have on the streets of London and elsewhere are welfare-state mobs. The youth who are 'rising up' - actually they are simply shattering their own communities - represent a generation that has been more suckled by the state than any generation before it. They live in those urban territories where the sharp-elbowed intrusion of the welfare state over the past 30 years has pushed aside older ideals of self-reliance and community spirit. The march of the welfare state into every aspect of less well-off urban people's existences, from their financial wellbeing to their childrearing habits and even into their emotional lives, with the rise of therapeutic welfarism designed to ensure that the poor remain 'mentally fit', has helped to undermine such things as individual resourcefulness and social bonding. The anti-social youthful rioters look to me like the end product of such an anti-social system of state intervention.
Unsurprisingly, I'm more sympathetic to O'Neill. But I wonder - are these actually entirely incompatible views? Sennett and Sassen don't argue that the London riots represent any kind of genuine political revolt against David Cameron's budget cuts. (Unlike in previous protests, they write, "the rioters seem motivated by a more diffuse anger, behaving like crazed shoppers on a spree ...") Nor do they go out of their way to defend the actual effectiveness of Britain's public sector - which currently consumes 45 to 50 percent of national G.D.P., a figure that the cuts contemplated by the Cameron government would reduce to 40 to 45 percent - as an engine of opportunity, upward mobility and the like. (The only government program directed toward the young and unemployed that they single out for praise are "storefront drop-in centers" designed to keep rowdy twentysomethings off the street.) Instead, their op-ed leaves the strong impression that that we should be wary of cutting government spending not so much because it necessarily improves the prospects of the poor, but because it serves as a kind of contemporary Danegeld: A price worth paying to buy off the young men with track suits and smartphones who would otherwise inflict random violence against their own neighbors and communities. As a judgment on the motives of the rioters, this seems more damning even than O'Neill's comments. And as a "defense" of the role that government programs current play in British society, it reads as a more devastating critique of welfare state culture than anything that a right-wing author could possibly offer.

HEADLINE: Rick Perry's Unanswered Prayers

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Is God ignoring the governor of Texas?

 BODY:
A few months ago, with Texas aflame from more than 8,000 wildfires brought on by extreme drought, a man who hopes to the next president took pen in hand and went to work:
"Now, therefore, I, Rick Perry, Governor of Texas, under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Statutes of the State of Texas, do hereby proclaim the three-day period from Friday, April 22, 2011, to Sunday, April 24, 2011, as Days of Prayer for Rain in the State of Texas."
Then the governor prayed, publicly and often. Alas, a rainless spring was followed by a rainless summer. July was the hottest month in recorded Texas history. Day after pitiless day, from Amarillo to Laredo, from Toadsuck to Twitty, folks were greeted by a hot, white bowl overhead, triple-digit temperatures, and a slow death on the land.
In the four months since Perry's request for divine intervention, his state has taken a dramatic turn for the worse. Nearly all of Texas is now in "extreme or exceptional" drought, as classified by federal meteorologists, the worst in Texas history.
Lakes have disappeared. Creeks are phantoms, the caked bottoms littered with rotting, dead fish. Farmers cannot coax a kernel of grain from ground that looks like the skin of an aging elephant.
Is this Rick Perry's fault, a slap to a man who doesn't believe that humans can alter the earth's climate - God messin' with Texas? No, of course not. God is too busy with the upcoming Cowboys football season and solving the problems that Tony Romo has reading a blitz.
But Perry's tendency to use prayer as public-policy demonstrate, in the midst of a truly painful, wide-ranging and potentially catastrophic crisis in the nation's second most-populous state, how he would govern if he became president.
"I think it's time for us to just hand it over to God, and say, 'God: You're going to have to fix this,'" he said in a speech in May, explaining how some of the nation's most serious problems could be solved.
That was a warm-up of sorts for his prayer-fest, 30,000 evangelicals in Houston's Reliant Stadium on Saturday. From this gathering came a very specific prayer for economic recovery. On the following Monday, the first day God could do anything about it, Wall Street suffered its worst one-day collapse since the 2008 crisis. The Dow sunk by 635 points.
Prayer can be meditative, healing, and humbling. It can also be magical thinking. Given how Perry has said he would govern by outsourcing to the supernatural, it's worth asking if God is ignoring him.
Though Perry will not officially announce his candidacy until Saturday, he loomed large over the Republican debate Thursday night. With their denial of climate change, basic budget math, and the indisputable fact that most of the nation's gains have gone overwhelmingly to a wealthy few in the last decade, the candidates form a Crazy Eight caucus. You could power a hay ride on their nutty ideas.
After the worst week of his presidency (and the weakest Oval Office speech since Gerald Ford unveiled buttons to whip inflation), the best thing Barack Obama has going for him is this Republican field. He still beats all of them in most polling match-ups.
Perry is supposed to be the savior. When he joins the campaign in the next few days, expect him to show off his boots; they are emblazoned with the slogan dating to the 1835 Texas Revolution: "Come and Take It." He once explained the logo this way: "Come and take it - that's what it's all about." This is not a man one would expect to show humility in prayer.
Perry revels in a muscular brand of ignorance (Rush Limbaugh is a personal hero), one that extends to the ever-fascinating history of the Lone Star State. Twice in the last two years he's broached the subject of Texas seceding from the union.
"When we came into the nation in 1845 we were a republic, we were a stand-alone nation," says Perry in a 2009 video that has just surfaced. "And one of the deals was, we can leave any time we want. So we're kind of thinking about that again."
He can dream all he wants about the good old days when Texas left the nation to fight for the slave-holding states of the breakaway confederacy. But the law will not get him there. There is no such language in the Texas or United States' constitutions allowing Texas to unilaterally "leave any time we want."
But Texas special. By many measures, it is the nation's most polluted state. Dirty air and water do not seem to bother Perry. He is, however, extremely perturbed by the Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement of laws designed to clean the world around him. In a recent interview, he wished for the president to pray away the E.P.A.
To Jews, Muslims, non-believers and even many Christians, the Biblical bully that is Rick Perry must sound downright menacing, particularly when he gets into religious absolutism. "As a nation, we must call upon Jesus to guide us through unprecedented struggles," he said last week.
As a lone citizen, he's free to advocate Jesus-driven public policy imperatives. But coming from someone who wants to govern this great mess of a country with all its beliefs, Perry's language is an insult to the founding principles of the republic. Substitute Allah or a Hindu God for Jesus and see how that polls.
Perry is from Paint Creek, an unincorporated hamlet in the infinity of the northwest Texas plains. I've been there. In wet years, it's pretty, the birds clacking on Lake Stamford, the cotton high. This year, it's another sad moonscape in the Lone Star State.
Over the last 15 years, taxpayers have shelled out $232 million in farm subsidies to Haskell County, which includes Paint Creek - a handout to more than 2,500 recipients, better than one out every three residents. God may not always be reliable, but in Perry's home county, the Federal government certainly is.

HEADLINE: Five Things to Watch for in Iowa Debate

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Eight Republican presidential contenders will debate in Ames, Iowa, on Thursday night, two days before the straw poll there.

 BODY:
AMES, Iowa - Eight Republican presidential contenders will gather on a stage here Thursday night for a two-hour, high-stakes exchange just two days before the first real contest of the nominating process.
The debate, sponsored by the Iowa Republican Party and Fox News, will not include all of the potential Republican candidates. Rick Perry, the governor of Texas, is expected to enter the race within days but will not be on the stage. Neither will Sarah Palin, who has not indicated she is running but did announce on Tuesday that she would show up at the Iowa State Fair sometime this week.
Still, with virtually the entire Republican field assembled in advance of Saturday's straw poll in Ames, the debate, which will be broadcast from Stephens Auditorium at Iowa State University, has the potential to help shape the presidential contest as it heads into the fall.
What are the critical things to look for? Here are five:
1. A Huntsman pulse? The debate will be the first for Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former Utah governor, who has had a tough time since he entered the Republican contest in late June. Mr. Huntsman, President Obama's former ambassador to China, came into the race with high expectations but remains in low single-digits in most polls and has already gone through a campaign reorganization. All of which means his performance in the debate will be crucial.
Donors, in particular, want to see how Mr. Huntsman performs on a national stage and whether he can create a spark with Republican viewers - and voters. If he has a strong night and creates a bit of political buzz, fund-raising will get easier, and he might start to rise in the polls.
Until recently, Mr. Huntsman has been among the most polite of the candidates, urging a return to "civility" in politics. But after the campaign shake-up, his message has gotten a bit sharper, especially when it comes to criticizing his rival Mitt Romney and his former boss Mr. Obama. And, of course, civility does not create buzz.
2. Beat up on Romney time. There is nothing more frustrating to a candidate for political office than running against a front-runner who just will not engage. That has been Mr. Romney's strategy so far, and it's got to be driving the other candidates crazy.
So it will be interesting to see whether Mr. Romney's rivals think it's about time that he gets down in the mud and wrestles a bit. The political punches could come from Tim Pawlenty and Mr. Huntsman, who are eager to see their poll numbers rise, or from Michele Bachmann, who might envision a future in which the two of them battle for the nomination down to the wire.
For Mr. Romney's part, the question is whether he can spend the two hours remaining above the Republican fray and continuing to focus his attacks on President Obama. It has worked so far, but refusing to answer attacks from rivals in his party could allow those negative questions to linger in the minds of viewers.
3. Pawlenty's spine. Mr. Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor, has lagged behind the leading contenders in polls and fund-raising, and the debate could be his last big opportunity to sway large numbers of Iowa voters. To do so, he may need to show more strength than he did in the last debate, when he declined to use his time on the stage to continue an attack on the health care legislation Mr. Romney passed while governor of Massachusetts. It made him look weak and indecisive. 
But there are indications that he might take a different approach this time. In remarks as he traveled around Iowa, Mr. Pawlenty suggested that his reputation for being "Minnesota nice" should not be confused with an inability to be tough when it comes to his political opponents.
At an event in Johnston, Iowa, this week, a supporter yelled that "you've got to be up there and give them hell." The voter later said he was talking about Mr. Pawlenty being aggressive with Mr. Romney and his other Republican rivals.
"We will," Mr. Pawlenty told the man.
4. Is Bachmann presidential? For Mr. Pawlenty's fellow Minnesotan, Mrs. Bachmann, the question may be whether she can repeat her performance from the last debate, when she surprised many observers with her pulled-together, presidential demeanor.
Mrs. Bachmann's political prowess comes in part from her willingness to take extreme positions that are characterized by the establishment as "wacky" but which fire up the conservative base. Coming into the race, her challenge was to steer a course that satisfied both of those constituencies.
In her first debate appearance, she did that well, impressing Republican insiders and donors while not disappointing her core supporters. Can she do it again? 
5. Best Obama attack line. For all of the candidates, attacking Mr. Obama has become almost like breathing. The economy's struggles have provided an almost daily stream of material that the Republicans happily serve up at rallies and in interviews, and this will most likely continue during the debate.
But the question is which of those attacks will cut through the clutter. Republican voters are looking for someone who they believe can take on Mr. Obama in next year's general election campaign. Even with his poll numbers slipping, Mr. Obama is expected to be a formidable candidate, and Republicans know that.
So look for each of the candidates on the stage to try to outdo the other when it comes to lashing out at the president. Mr. Pawlenty has called him "inept" and a "bobblehead." Mrs. Bachmann has called him "out of touch" and a failed leader. Mr. Romney has said Mr. Obama is "not up to the task" of being president. Their rivals - Herman Cain, Ron Paul, Newt Gingrich, and Rick Santorum - will also be working on their one-liners.
But which one will break through with a zinger on national television? That's something to watch for.

HEADLINE: Clyburn, Becerra, Van Hollen Join Special Committee on Debt


HIGHLIGHT: All twelve members of the bipartisan, bicameral special committee charged with finding more deficit reduction have now been named.

 BODY:
Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, today announced her three appointees to the special congressional committee tasked with finding ways to reduce federal budget deficits, even as a Republican member of the newly formed panel expressed an openness to consider possible tax increases.
Ms. Pelosi's choices complete the 12-member panel, which is evenly divided between both the parties and the two houses of Congress.
All three members named by Ms. Pelosi hold leading roles in the party: Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina, the No. 3 House Democrat; Representative Xavier Becerra of California, vice chair of the Democratic Caucus; and Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
Ms. Pelosi said in a statement that the committee "has a golden opportunity to take its discussions to the higher ground of America's greatness and its values." 
Created as part of the agreement to raise the federal debt ceiling, the panel is supposed to recommend ways to reduce federal budget deficits by at least $1.2 trillion over 10 years. If the panel fails to do so by its Nov. 23 deadline, or if its ideas are not enacted, the agreement calls for the government automatically to cut spending across the board. 
If even a single panel member crosses party lines to provide a majority vote, the committee can forward its proposals to the floor of the House and the Senate for up-or-down votes without amendments.
One Republican member of the committee, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, said today that he would not rule out possible tax increases -- a central point of contention in the recent debt talks and something many economists contend will be a necessary element to any successful bipartisan proposal. 
"I don't want to rule anything in or out," Mr. Camp told Reuters. "I am willing to discuss all issues that might help us reduce our short and long-term debt and grow our economy." 
"Everything is on the table, until we as a group rule it out," he said.
Ms. Pelosi, in her statement, described Mr. Clyburn as a consensus builder with experience on the Appropriations Committee; Mr. Becerra as a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee who "placed the interests of America's working families first"; and Mr. Van Hollen as a Democratic leader in the deficit-reduction talks led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
The three Democratic members will join three House Republicans, Jeb Hensarling of Texas and Mr. Camp and Fred Upton, both from Michigan, on the committee. The Senate will be represented by three Republicans, Jon Kyl of Arizona, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio, along with the Democrats Patty Murray of Washington, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Max Baucus of Montana.

HEADLINE: Romney Says 'Corporations Are People' in Exchange with Heckler

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney offered a glimpse into his business perspective at the Iowa state fair, telling a group of hecklers, "Corporations are people, my friend."

 BODY:
Mitt Romney, the leading Republican candidate for his party's nomination who likes to tout his years in the private sector when out on the stump, offered a glimpse into his own business perspective at the Iowa state fair, telling a group of hecklers, "Corporations are people, my friend." 
Mr. Romney was speaking at the fair's soapbox Thursday morning, but when it was time for the question-and-answer session, the mood turned heated, with a small group of angry voters calling for Mr. Romney to raise taxes on the wealthy to help fund social entitlement programs. (The exchange begins at around the 20:30 mark in this C-SPAN video.)
"We have to make sure that the promises we make in social security, Medicare and Medicaid are promises we can keep, and there are various ways of doing that," Mr. Romney said. "One is we can raise taxes on people." 
"Corporations!" the protesters shouted, suggesting the former Massachusetts governor raise taxes on large businesses. "Corporations!"
"Corporations are people, my friend," Mr. Romney respond, as the hecklers shouted back, "No they're not!"
"Of course they are," Mr. Romney said, chuckling slightly. "Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to people. Where to do you think it goes?"
When someone in the front row angrily suggested that "it goes in their pockets," Mr. Romney, becoming increasingly animated, asked: "Whose pockets? People's pockets!"
Thursday marked Mr. Romney's most fiery day on the campaign trail this week, even before the hecklers drew him into several aggressive exchanges. Wearing a navy blue shirt and brown jeans, Mr. Romney took the stage with sweat already glistening on his brow and upper lip, which trickled down his cheek as he worked himself into animated rhythm in a ten-minute speech that criticized President Obama.
 
"We're led by a man who is a fine fellow but he's out of his depth and doesn't understand how the economy works," Mr. Romney said.
And when the questions turned combative, Mr. Romney held his ground.
"If you want to speak, you can speak, but right now it's my turn," Mr. Romney said to applause, leaning down into the crowd to cut off an elderly man who was yelling at him about social security.
"You came here to listen!" the man retorted, to which Mr. Romney replied: "No, no, I came here to talk. Hold on a second, let me speak."
Moments later, when he realized he wasn't changing any of the hecklers' minds, he said they were free to vote for someone else.
"I'm not going to raise taxes - that's my answer," he said. "And if you want someone who can raise taxes, you can vote for Barack Obama."

HEADLINE: Warren Edges Closer to Senate Run

BYLINE: ABBY GOODNOUGH


HIGHLIGHT: Elizabeth Warren has enlisted two former top aides to Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts to help her assess whether to run for the U.S. Senate.

 BODY:
BOSTON - Elizabeth Warren has enlisted two former top aides to Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts to help her assess whether to run for the U.S. Senate here and will make a decision after Labor Day, a Democrat familiar with her efforts said Thursday.
Ms. Warren, who set up the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in Washington but did not get nominated by President Obama to run it, also seemed to be laying ground for a Senate run in a posting Thursday on the liberal blog Blue Mass Group. She described her working-class background, noted that she and her husband were returning to "our home of 17 years in Massachusetts" and added that while she had left Washington, "I don't plan to stop fighting for middle class families."

"It is time for me to think hard about what role I can play next to help rebuild a middle class that has been hacked at, chipped at, and pulled at for more than a generation - and that is under greater strain every day," Ms. Warren wrote on the blog. "In the weeks ahead, I want to hear from you about the challenges we face and how we get our economy growing again. I also want to hear your ideas about how we can fix what all of us - regardless of party - know is a badly broken political system."
Doug Rubin, a former chief of staff to Mr. Patrick who also ran his two successful campaigns for governor, and Kyle Sullivan, Mr. Patrick's former spokesman, will be working with Ms. Warren as she makes a decision over the coming weeks, according to several Democratic operatives here.
Ms. Warren, a 62-year-old native of Oklahoma, lives in Cambridge and teaches at Harvard Law School. Seven other Democrats have already jumped into the race against Senator Scott Brown, a popular and well-financed freshman who won a special election in 2010 for the seat that Edward M. Kennedy had held for 47 years. But so far, the Democratic field lacks a standout.

HEADLINE: Fact Check: The Republican Debate

BYLINE: MICHAEL COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican presidential candidates who squared off Thursday night in Iowa made several misleading, incomplete or simply false claims.

 BODY:
As they tried to pin the blame for the nation's lowered credit rating squarely on President Obama, the Republican presidential candidates who squared off Thursday night in Iowa made several misleading, incomplete or simply false claims.
"I was fortunate enough to be a governor that got an increase in the credit rating of my state at the same time we got a president who got a decrease in the credit rating of our nation,'' Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, said. "And that's because our president simply doesn't understand how to lead and how to grow an economy."
And Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota repeated her assertion that "we should not have increased the debt ceiling." 
"In the last two months, I was leading on the issue of not increasing the debt ceiling,'' she said. "That turned out to be the right answer."
The ratings agency that lowered the credit rating,Standard & Poor's, has carefully avoided partisan finger-pointing in its explanations of its downgrade. But some of the factors it cited - from the "political brinksmanship" that left the nation at the precipice of default to its concerns that the deficit-cutting deal "falls short" of what is needed - can be attributed to Republicans in Congress as much as, or even more than, President Obama.
The ratings agency lamented in its report on the downgrade that "the statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy.''
It was Republicans in Congress who made it a bargaining chip. They balked at raising the nation's $14.3 trillion debt limit - which was needed to pay for spending that Congress had already approved - unless the White House agreed to a new package of spending cuts. The Obama administration initially sought a "clean" bill to raise the debt limit, saying that needed steps to reduce the deficit should not be linked to a bill that had to be passed so the nation could pay the bills it had already incurred.
The Republicans prevailed. When, after weeks of wrangling, a bill to reduce the deficit and raise the debt ceiling was finally passed this month, the nation was just hours away from a default that economists warned would have harmed the fragile economy.
Of course, President Obama acted similarly to Ms. Bachmann when he was in the Senate: he voted against raising the debt limit in 2006, a vote his aides say he regrets.
But pominent economists and business leaders have said a failure to raise the debt ceiling would have led to a default that would have hurt the economy. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, testified that it would likely be "a recovery-ending event.'' Speaking this spring to the United States Chamber of Commerce about the possibility of default, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, ''If anyone wants to push that button, which I think would be catastrophic and unpredictable, I think they're crazy.''
Several Republicans assailed President Obama for not cutting spending enough. S.& P. warned that the agreement, which is expected to cut the deficit by at least $2.1 trillion over the next decade, "falls short of the amount that we believe is necessary."
But President Obama pushed for a plan to cut the deficit by $4 trillion, with cuts to entitlement programs that are popular with Democrats - including Medicare and Medicaid - as well as some $1 trillion in new revenues. It was House Republicans who rejected it, opposing any tax increases and ultimately pushing for the smaller measure.
The Republican opposition to tax increases may have been a factor as well. S. & P. wrote that it takes no position on the mix of spending and revenue measures needed to shore up the nation's finances. But one factor it cited in its report was its belief that the Bush tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 - which are due to expire at the end of 2012 - would remain. "We have changed our assumption on this because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues," it wrote.
And what about the balanced budget amendment Mr. Romney and most of the Republican presidential candidates called for? It may not have helped with the ratings agencies either.
John Chambers, the chairman of the sovereign rating committee at S. & P., was cool to the idea of a balanced budget amendment when he was asked about it last week on CNN. "It would just reduce your flexibility in a crisis," he sad in the interview.

HEADLINE: New Rules and Old Plants May Strain Summer Energy Supplies

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As 58 million people across 13 states sweated through the third day of a heat wave last month, power demand in North America's largest regional grid jurisdiction hit a record high. And yet there was no shortage, no rolling blackout and no brownout in an area that stretches from Maryland to Chicago.
But that may not be the case in the future as stricter air quality rules are put in place. Eastern utilities satisfied demand that day -- July 21 -- with hefty output from dozens of 1950s and 1960s coal-burning power plants that dump prodigious amounts of acid gases, soot, mercury and arsenic into the air. Because of new Environmental Protection Agency rules, and some yet to be written, many of those plants are expected to close in coming years.
No one is sure yet how many or which ones will be shuttered or what the total lost output would be. And there is little agreement over how peak demand will be met in future summers. 
The E.P.A. estimates that a rule on air toxins and mercury that it expects to complete in November will result in a loss of 10,000 megawatts -- or almost 1 percent of the generating capacity in the United States. Electricity experts, however, say that rule, combined with forthcoming ones on coal ash and cooling water, will have a much greater effect -- from 48,000 megawatts to 80,000 megawatts, or 3.5 to 7 percent.
The Southern Company, which like most coal-burning power companies opposes the new standards, said on Aug. 4 that it would retire 4,000 megawatts of coal-fired generation under the proposed rules. It warned that the closings would ''significantly impact customers and the overall U.S. economy as a result of higher costs for electricity and reduced reliability.''
American Electric Power, a multistate utility based in Columbus, Ohio, is saying it will retire 6,000 megawatts. Much of that was scheduled to retire anyway, but the rules have stepped up those retirement dates.
Robert W. Perciasepe, the deputy administrator of the E.P.A., said his agency had not estimated all the retirements that would be set off by rules it was still preparing. His agency, he said, was trying to move promptly through rulemaking and ''provide the rational basis for utility planning, instead of this continually rolling ball of uncertainty, which allows people to speculate, and creates a situation where it's very difficult for competent utility planners to do the work they need to do.''
He said the E.P.A. had been regulating power plant emissions for 40 years, and where necessary to keep the grid stable, had granted delays and exemptions.
The industry is concerned. PJM Interconnection, the regional unit that set the demand record on July 21, has suggested that the E.P.A. rules would put the grid's reliability at risk. ''E.P.A.'s analysis of the impact of the proposed rule may understate the level of expected generation of plant retirements and does not provide sufficient flexibility or time to address potential localized reliability concerns,'' it wrote in a statement filed with the agency.
The most likely replacement for the coal plants is new natural gas-powered generators. But PJM and others are complaining that if the E.P.A. follows its intended schedule, utilities will not have much time to decide whether to close or upgrade their old plants, and no one will have time to build new ones.
Marc de Croisset, an analyst for the investment bank FBR, said the uncertainties arose from the scale of the plant closings. ''It's a major transformation,'' he said -- the biggest since the electric companies shifted away from oil in the 1970s, possibly larger.
On July 20, a record was also set farther to the west, reported by the Midwest Independent System Operator, a parallel organization that stretches from Michigan to Montana and Manitoba.
On Aug. 1 and 2, the Southwest Power Pool, which covers an area from Kansas to New Mexico, set a record. Texas, which is an electrical island in its grid operation, also set new records. And New York State, which forms its own electrical jurisdiction, has come within a whisker of doing so.
Most of the old records had been set in a heat wave at the end of July 2006. Peak electricity use in the intervening years has been stunted by the natural variability of weather and a recession.
The new peaks will shape the planning of the grid. In the eastern United States, electricity is mostly generated near where it is consumed, and if some producers disappear, someone will have to build new generation or new transmission to supply the area from a distant source.
''You always manage toward the peak, and have a reserve margin based on your latest peak,'' said Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy, which does business in areas that experienced a new peak.
Peak supply is also becoming a vexing problem because so much of the generating capacity added around the country lately is wind power, which is almost useless on the hot, still days when air-conditioning drives up demand.
PJM, which once stood for Pennsylvania, Jersey and Maryland, factors in such variability, counting a 100-megawatt wind farm as being worth only 13 megawatts on a peak summer day, for example. While over the course of a year the wind machines can contribute mightily to kilowatt hours produced, they do much of their production on windy winter nights, according to experts at PJM and other grid organizations.
In summer, utility planners have increasingly turned to a tool known as demand response, in which big customers sign up to have some of their power switched off in exchange for cash payments or cheaper rates. It is somewhat like an airline passenger's volunteering to be ''bumped'' in exchange for a free ticket. Companies recruit consumers willing to have their consumption electronically throttled.
That can help, but if plants close before a replacement is found, local demand can exceed supply, creating scattered shortages. ''There's a lot of trepidation, and rightfully so,'' said Paul M. Sotkiewicz, the senior economist at PJM.
Very few companies that own coal-fired power plants have announced which ones will close, partly because they are waiting to see what their neighbors decide. If a competitor goes out of business, prices for electricity will rise and the survivor could get enough revenue to make expensive upgrades worthwhile.
''They're playing a giant game of chicken right now, to be the last man standing, just like the airlines,'' said Mr. de Croisset, the FBR analyst.
The agency is writing a cascade of ruleson emissions of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and mercury, and handling of ash; it published a ''Cross-State Air Pollution Rule'' last month.
American Electric Power has listed 25 of 55 coal-fired generators as candidates for being shuttered, many of which have been running at full capacity lately. On that list is a 42-year-old behemoth in Louisa, Ky., called Big Sandy 2. Upgrading it would cost $700 million, the company says.
''This heat wave shows that you can't rely on a massive amount of wind generation to fill the void,'' Pat Hemlepp, a spokesman for American Electric Power, wrote in an e-mail. ''That's why we are extremely concerned about reliability.''
Others say that A.E.P. has been slower than its competitors to upgrade its plants and is now seeking delays in new E.P.A. rules to keep its competitive advantage.
Michael J. Bradley, a consultant based in Concord, Mass., said A.E.P. was ''not in a great position because they haven't reinvested.''
Some Republicans in Congress would like to step in to block new E.P.A. rules. Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the ranking minority member of the Senate Energy Committee, recently sent a pointed letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asking what the effects of the plant retirements would be.
Senator Murkowski said in a statement that E.P.A. rules were coming at a ''breakneck pace,'' too fast for government reliability experts to keep up. She predicted ''an avalanche of waivers.''

HEADLINE: Risk of Parking In Safe Havens

BYLINE: By AGNES T. CRANE and CHRISTOPHER HUGHES

 BODY:
Financial lifeboats are starting to get crowded. Investors in droves have been seeking safety from sinking stocks. But some vessels of refuge have shown how quickly they can be rocked when too many investors pile in.
Swiss authorities had already signaled displeasure with excessive desire for local money last week when they cut interest rates to zero. Yet investors, prodded by ultralow rates in the United States, kept buying. More stringent measures would be needed to hold off the masses, and media reports about possibly linking the soaring franc to the wobbly euro sent the Swiss currency tumbling.
Gold enthusiasts also were abated. The CME Group, an operator of exchanges, raised margin requirements for gold futures. As a result, doomsayers, inflation hawks and speculators who had sought the ultimate escape watched the price of their precious yellow metal fall more than 3 percent at one point on Thursday. 
American debt and government-guaranteed mortgage bonds have also had an influx from investors trying to navigate the current storm despite the country's loss of its AAA credit rating. Though they later sold off, 10-year Treasury notes yielded as little as 2.17 percent on Thursday morning, almost 60 percent lower than their 2011 peak.
Bonds backed by home loans also got a huge lift this week when the Federal Reserve indicated it would keep financing costs extremely low for two years. That locks in easy, and seemingly safe, profit for those borrowing short and investing long. With yields much lower than inflation -- 3.6 percent on an annualized basis -- it's no wonder investors don't feel much buyer's remorse.
There is of course a difference between speculative bubbles caused by greed and psychological ones born of fear. But so-called safety trades can blow up much the same way as risky ones. It's just that policy makers, rather than the invisible hand, are the more likely holders of the pin.
Changing currency pegs in Switzerland, allowing the renminbi to appreciate in China or ongoing bullheadedness in Washington could make today's emergency rafts look less seaworthy. Worse, if inflation turns out to be the real threat, investors may find themselves paddling feverishly to change course.
Short on Logic
The financial fashion is for all things 2008. Bank shares in Europe on Thursday jumped on expectations that some countries were preparing to revive short-selling bans they had introduced in the crisis. The desire to protect financial institutions from a potentially self-fulfilling loss of confidence is understandable. But changing the rules in turbulent times risks damaging markets in the longer term.
Though share prices can be volatile, investors should be prepared. Any leveraged investor with a portfolio consisting entirely of French financial stocks would have been justifiably wiped out by the recent sell-off. By contrast, careful and diversified shareholders will be deterred from being prudent in the future if regulators intervene at the first sign of trouble. An unpredictable regime could in theory prompt all equity investors to demand a higher risk premium for owning stocks, inflating the cost of capital for companies.
To be fair to regulators, equity investors are not their main concern. The goal is to prevent a loss of confidence that can be self-reinforcing when applied to banks. Sharp share-price drops can set off moves in the credit-default swaps of banks, which add to the equity sell-off. This in turn can prompt a strike by providers of short-term wholesale financing, potentially initiating a full-blown liquidity crisis.
But it's hard to think of examples where genuinely healthy institutions have been brought down purely by speculators hunting in packs. The short-sellers who aimed at financial institutions in 2008 were right: those firms genuinely needed large injections of capital.
Though most lenders have been recapitalized, they now face questions about sovereign debt exposures, and the ability of governments to bail them out if necessary. Besides, it's far from clear short-selling is to blame. The proportion of shares of Societe Generale out on loan, for example, is less than the European average.
Previous bans have arrested volatility only temporarily. And there is a natural curb to speculative shorting: a sudden turn in confidence can scar investors. Equity prices are a symptom, not a cause, of the financial contagion. Regulators should not punish the market for doing its job.

HEADLINE: Seeking Safety in a Perilous Market: 4 European Nations Act to Curtail Stock Short-Selling

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and STEPHEN CASTLE; Liz Alderman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A European market regulator announced Thursday night that short-selling of stocks in several countries would be temporarily banned in an effort to stop the tailspin in the markets.
The move may put pressure on United States market regulators to ban short sales as well. American bank stocks have been volatile all week as global investors expressed concerns that problems in Europe might cross the ocean.
The European Securities and Markets Authority, a body that coordinates the European Union's market policies, said in a statement that short sales -- negative bets on stocks -- would be curtailed in France, Belgium, Italy and Spain effective Friday. There is already a temporary short-sale ban in Greece and Turkey. 
''Today some authorities have decided to impose or extend existing short-selling bans in their respective countries,'' the authority said. ''They have done so either to restrict the benefits that can be achieved from spreading false rumors or to achieve a regulatory level playing field, given the close interlinkage between some E.U. markets.''
In France, that country's market watchdog banned short-selling or increasing short-selling positions, effective immediately, for 15 days on 11 financial institutions. They are: the April Group, Axa, BNP Paribas, CIC, CNP Assurances, Credit Agricole, Euler Hermes, Natixis, Paris Re, Scor and Societe Generale.
The European authority's statement said that details for each country would be posted on the Web sites of their individual financial regulators.
The emergency measures are raising comparisons to the financial crisis of 2008, when the United States and many other governments banned short sales on many financial stocks.
European financial regulators have been discussing a Continent-wide ban over the last few days amid fears from governments like France that the short sales were driving a panic. Financial regulators held two conference calls on Thursday to complete the declaration, according to a government official with knowledge of the talks. Britain and Germany are among the countries that did not join the ban.
In short sales, a trader sells borrowed shares in hopes that they will decline in value before he has to buy them back to close out his loan. The difference in price is his profit, or loss.
Critics say short-selling encourages speculation and pushes stock prices down, sometimes feeding on itself in a panicked market. Advocates say it provides important information about investor views on companies, and also maintains liquidity.
Financial historians warned that the bans in 2008 did not work and that such measures were often driven more by political concerns -- the need to display some form of decisive action -- than by proved market theories.
''The short-sale ban really smacks of desperation,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. ''That's their plan for solving the euro debt crisis? I mean, this isn't going to buy them much time.''
The crisis in Europe, Mr. Rogoff said, goes far beyond falling stock prices and has more to do with the state of banks there, including banks in Italy and France. He said the sovereign debt problems were an extension of the stress on the system created by the banking crisis.
The increasing number of European governments that are banning short-selling puts United States regulators in a tricky position. Investors with negative views on bank stocks who are forced to close their negative bets in Europe might shift them to American banks.
On Thursday, stocks in the United States continued their seesaw ride, surging 4 percent, buoyed by hopeful data on initial jobless claims. The cost of insurance on several United States banks like Bank of America and Citigroup has gone up this week, according to Markit, a financial data company, indicating that investors are growing more negative on these companies.
The short-selling announcement in Europe stirred some immediate criticism.
''It is a crisis of confidence, and when you do something like this, it shows a lack of confidence, which is exactly the opposite of what you want to say to the markets,'' said Robert Sloan, managing partner of S3 Partners, a firm that helps hedge funds manage relationships with their brokers.
Back in 2008, European and United States officials coordinated temporary bans on shorting financial stocks.
Hedge funds, in particular, were hurt by the ban back then because it interfered with trading strategies that paired negative bets with positive ones.
It is impossible to know whether the panic of 2008 would have been worse without the ban, which protected companies like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, but general studies of short-selling have found that bans on that activity can lead to more volatility in the market and lower trading volume, according to Andrew W. Lo, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Mr. Lo said that banning short-selling also removed important information about what investors thought about the financial health of companies, and suggested that the bans served mainly political purposes.
''It's a bit like suggesting we take heart patients in the emergency room off of the heart monitor because you don't want to make doctors and nurses anxious about the patient,'' he said.
Some investors have been anticipating for months that a short-selling ban might occur and were pre-emptively getting out of their short positions, said Mr. Sloan of S3 Partners. He also said that if there were more short-sellers in the market now, the markets might be falling less than they are. That is because as markets fall, short-sellers often close their positions to cash in profits, and to do so they have to purchase shares to cash out. The markets could use these sorts of buyers now, Mr. Sloan said.
Even with the European countries' bans on short sales of some stocks, investors who have negative opinions on companies may still find ways to bet against them in the derivatives market, if those sorts of trades remain allowed.

HEADLINE: N.J. Nets' Owner Raises Profile in Russian Politics

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- The metals tycoon and New Jersey Nets owner Mikhail D. Prokhorov, whose emergence as a party leader in Russia is one of the brain-teasers of the political season, said on Thursday that he would consider accepting the post of prime minister -- but only if he likes the agenda of the incoming president.
''It seems to me that I could handle the prime minister's job,'' Mr. Prokhorov said coolly. 
Coming from a billionaire who has never held public office and whose party appears to be in disarray, the suggestion sounded far-fetched. But Mr. Prokhorov steamed ahead, revealing almost nothing about his platform except for one proposal: That Russia abandon its seven-hundred-year-old currency, the ruble, in favor of the euro.
A flurry of commentary ensued, filling the strange political vacuum that that has characterized this summer in Moscow. Though momentous matters hang in the balance -- whether Vladimir V. Putin will remain in power for another decade, and whether the state he constructed will be preserved or reformed -- discussion of these issues has gone silent. The realization has set in that these choices will be made far from public view by a narrow circle of people.
Mr. Prokhorov's press conference at least gave people something to argue about. A top official of the Communist Party reacted with a dark warning: ''Today there's no ruble, tomorrow there are no borders, the day after tomorrow there will be no Russia.'' And Yuri Shuvalov of the ruling party, United Russia, gleefully denounced the proposal as proof that liberals are out of touch with the needs of ordinary Russians.
''Maybe Mikhail Prokhorov has personally already entered the euro zone,'' Mr. Shuvalov told the radio station Ekho Moskvy.
Dmitri O. Rogozin, Russia's envoy to NATO, chortled over his Twitter feed:
''Prokhorov is ready for the prime ministry. It's just that the prime ministry is not ready for him.''
Mr. Prokhorov's role in Russian politics has been ambiguous for some time. He accumulated a fortune estimated at $17.8 billion, in part by selling his stake in a giant nickel company just before the 2008 financial crash, a step he was forced to take after falling out of favor with the government. This summer he was named the leader of Right Cause, becoming the first billionaire executive to dive into Russian politics in nearly a decade.
Right Cause is a pro-Western party that the Kremlin is supporting in hopes that it will attract wealthy and well-educated people who are disenchanted with United Russia. Mr. Prokhorov, therefore, is semi-loyal. He does not hesitate to attack the ruling party or call for restoration of some of the political freedoms that were rolled back under Mr. Putin, but he has not criticized Mr. Putin himself. There are rumors that Mr. Putin might choose Mr. Prokhorov to succeed him as prime minister if Mr. Putin returns to the presidency.
On Thursday, Mr. Prokhorov rolled out his first major political idea: establishing ''a larger Europe stretching from Lisbon to Vladivostok.'' The first step, he said, would be joining the Schengen Agreement, which removes border controls for travelers within Europe, followed by joining the European monetary union and adopting the euro currency. These steps, he said, could allow Russia to become Europe's leading economy in the next decade.
''Of course, this probably sounds pretty radical at first,'' Mr. Prokhorov said. ''But the Russian ruble in my view will never become even a regional currency, because it is attached to oil and gas.''
He praised the efforts of Georgian leaders to stamp out police corruption -- an admiration shared by many in Moscow, but one that is risky to express in public because of the bad blood between the two capitals.
He was polite about the modernization program put forward by President Dmitri A. Medvedev, but said Russia needed industrial revitalization, not ''another Potemkin village.''
''If the country does not produce anything, that she will have little demand for innovation,'' he said. ''When there is no competition, innovation is not needed, because things are decided in a different way.''

HEADLINE: Bad Posture

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
The first thing you notice about ''Bad Posture'' is that it's unstudiedly cool: laid-back, observant and rather shady, it cares so little for your attention that you can't stop watching. 
This offhandedly nonchalant tone emanates in no small measure from the film's summer-doldrums setting in Albuquerque. The director, Malcolm Murray, grew up there (as did most of his nonprofessional cast of friends and acquaintances), and this guys-hanging-out feature -- Mr. Murray's first narrative project -- proceeds with an insider confidence that belies his inexperience and that of his collaborators.
Meandering but never aimless, Florian Brozek's script observes a recently unemployed graffiti artist named Flo (Mr. Brozek) and his roommate, Trey (Trey Cole), a petty thief and occasional drug dealer. A chance encounter with the sweet Marissa (Tabatha Shaun) fills Flo with romantic longing and allows Trey to boost her car and wallet. For the rest of the movie, the crime's gentle fallout provides the framework for a loving tour of Albuquerque subculture, a place where arguments are brief and cans of spray paint more prevalent than guns.
Enforcing a consistently mellow tone with inspired musical choices -- Flo's sole brush with violence plays out to Fredo Viola's song ''The Turn (A Pagan Lament),'' and a lengthy tagging sequence mesmerizes with the help of Monteverdi -- Mr. Murray creates a beguiling, visually rich canvas. In interviews he describes his film as a romance, but it's not the one we think: the real passion here is between the director and his hometown.
BAD POSTURE
Opens on Friday in Brooklyn.
Directed and edited by Malcolm Murray; written by Florian Brozek; director of photography, Mr. Murray; production design by Rich Watts; produced by Lucy Bickerton and Neda Armian. At the reRun Gastropub Theater, 147 Front Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn. Running time: 1 hour 33 minutes. This film is not rated.
WITH: Florian Brozek (Flo), Trey Cole (Trey) and Tabatha Shaun (Marissa).

HEADLINE: It Zigs, It Zags: Market Rises 4% After Down Day

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS and CHRISTINE HAUSER; Eric Dash contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Continuing the wild swings from panicked selling to fevered buying and back, stocks soared on Thursday, leaving investors bewildered about what might come next.
In a display of wild volatility, the American stock market this week has produced alternating days of collapsing prices -- accompanied by speculation of a renewed financial crisis that could be even worse than the one that began in 2008 -- and sharply rising prices amid reassurances that banks are healthy and corporate profits strong.
On Thursday, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index soared 51.88 points, or 4.6 percent to 1,172.64. Traders pointed to a small decline in claims for unemployment insurance in the United States and to reassurances from French officials that their country's banks were safe.
That gain recovered all of a 4.4 percent decline on Wednesday. For the two days, the index was up 0.11 points, or one one-hundredth of 1 percent. On Monday, the market had fallen by 6.7 percent, only to leap by 4.7 percent on Tuesday. So far this week, the index is down by 2.2 percent. 
''It is a very, very tense, emotional and momentum-driven market right now,'' said Eric Thorne, an investment adviser at Bryn Mawr Trust, a Pennsylvania bank. The apparent motto, he added, is ''shoot first, ask questions later.''
Never before in the history of the S.& P. index, which goes back to 1928, had there been alternating gains and losses of more than 4 percent on four days. In most years, there were no such days at all.
There were only two previous times since the Great Depression when the S.& P. 500 moved at least 4 percent in four consecutive trading sessions. The first came in October 1987, when the market crashed, and the second occurred in November 2008, as the financial crisis intensified. But neither of those saw alternating gains and losses. In each of those cases, the pattern was two declines, then two gains.
This year, market worries began to intensify in late July, as European leaders reached yet another agreement to provide emergency funding for Greece, which cannot borrow in the markets, and as a Congressional impasse threatened to prevent an increase in the American debt ceiling, which could have led to default. At the same time, sharp revisions in recent economic data raised concerns that the United States economy might be entering a new recession.
The worries accelerated last week, as borrowing costs shot up for two large European economies, Spain and Italy, and Friday night Standard & Poor's credit ratings arm lowered the rating of United States Treasury bonds to AA+, from AAA.
The European Central Bank tried to calm markets by beginning to buy Italian and Spanish bonds on Monday, but then traders appeared to grow nervous about French government bonds. Those worries soon spread to French banks, which hold many such bonds, and their prices fell sharply on Wednesday.
That panic appeared to peak early Thursday morning, New York time, when a Reuters report, which did not identify its sources, said at least one bank in Asia had cut its credit lines to the major French banks and that others were reviewing their lines because of perceived risks. The French stock market, which had been about level for the day, fell more than 3 percent within an hour, and American stock index futures fell sharply.
But there was no confirmation of the report, and it was denied by both bankers and officials in Paris. Prices quickly recovered.
Frederic Oudea, the chief executive of Societe Generale, whose shares have suffered the most in recent days, told Le Figaro, the French newspaper, in an interview published Thursday that the bank had ''suffered a series of attacks in the market,'' on the basis of rumors about its financial condition that he denied ''most vigorously.''
An announcement that the leaders of Germany and France would meet might have helped stocks strengthen, said Paul G. Christopher, chief international investment strategist for Wells Fargo Advisors. ''The markets need to have reassurance from governments that they are going to take care of their budget deficits and going to backstop their banks,'' he said.
The stock market collapse during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009 is still fresh in the minds of many investors, but so too is the sharp rebound in share prices that began in the spring of 2009, when the credit crisis was at its height. Those competing memories appear to have contributed to the wild swings, with investors alternately fearful of a collapse and worried that they might get out at the bottom.
While the American economy has been stumbling since the last recession officially ended in June 2009, corporate profits have risen to record levels. Cisco, the large American technology company, reported surprisingly strong earnings on Wednesday, and its share price leaped 16 percent. But that gain still left the price a little lower than it was two weeks ago.
''It's just a yo-yo,'' said Myles Zyblock, chief institutional strategist and managing director for capital markets research at RBC Capital Markets. ''I think the primary structure is still in place, and that is a structure of concern.'' He added, ''Emotional selling that happens in periods like this is not pinpoint specific.''
In American trading, the Dow Jones industrials rose 423.37, or 3.95 percent, to 11,143.31, and the Nasdaq composite climbed 4.7 percent to close at 2,492.68 after a gain of 111.63.
The rally continued in early trading Friday in Asia, where stocks rose less than 1 percent.
European indexes were also higher Thursday, with a large part of the advances coming after the American market opened.
Reports during the day on Thursday, confirmed after the end of trading, said several European countries planned to ban short-selling of financial stocks. In 2008, when similar bans were adopted during the financial crisis, many financial stocks rose sharply, only to fall sharply in later weeks as many of the rumors proved accurate.
The ability of banks to borrow money at favorable rates is more important to their success than is their stock price, and the risk is that mere rumors can lead cautious lenders to stand aside. Some have done so, and the banks have been forced to borrow more from the European Central Bank.
Gold, which has been steadily climbing this year, fell back on Thursday after margin requirements on gold futures were raised. That will make it more expensive to place bets on higher gold prices. Gold futures fell 1.8 percent, or $32.50, to $1,748.80. But prices rose a little in trading Thursday night.
For much of the last decade, there was remarkably little volatility in the stock market, which was seen as providing evidence that the United States had entered what Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, called the ''great moderation.''
But it picked up when the financial crisis began. While there were no days with 4 percent moves from 2003 through 2007, there were 10 in 2008 and 11 in 2009. There had been none this year until Aug. 4, when prices fell 4.8 percent. Then there were the four moves this week.

HEADLINE: Chinese Let Currency Rise Against The Dollar

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's currency staged a small but unexpected rally this week, as the country's central bank allowed it to rise 0.72 percent against the dollar, with most of the move coming Wednesday and Thursday. 
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which is part of the central bank, fixed the initial trading value Thursday morning below 6.4 renminbi to the dollar for the first time in the modern history of the currency.
Economists and traders interpreted the new trading value, 6.3991 to the dollar, as a signal that the central bank might be willing to tolerate a slightly faster rate of appreciation against the dollar, something the United States and other big industrial nations have long pressed China to do.
Daniel Hui, a senior foreign exchange strategist at HSBC, said in a research note that the recent movement in the daily fixing of the renminbi ''indicates something has changed -- the question is why, and if it will last.''
Allowing the renminbi to strengthen can help China fight inflation, by making imports cheaper. But a stronger renminbi can also hurt exports and employment at China's many export-oriented factories by making Chinese goods more expensive in foreign markets.
The government's National Bureau of Statistics announced Tuesday that inflation in consumer prices had reached 6.5 percent in July, the highest level in three years. At the same time, China's exports were showing unusual strength despite economic weakness in the West.
China's General Administration of Customs announced Wednesday that exports were up 20.4 percent in July from a year earlier, more than most economists had expected, producing a trade surplus of $31.5 billion, the country's largest in more than two years.
But any sustained acceleration in the appreciation of the renminbi could bring greater speculative inflows of money to China. As a result, many economists have been predicting that China may soon allow the currency to trade in a wider band each day around the initial fixing, which is done in Shanghai. Greater volatility makes it harder for speculators to borrow money to put bets on a rising renminbi.
The Administration of Foreign Exchange sets an initial trading value each day and then keeps the currency within a tight range around that value through the day by buying dollars, frequently on a large scale, and selling renminbi. In theory, the currency can vary during the day by as much as 0.5 percent, but the government has tended to keep the daily trading in a much tighter range, often less than 0.1 percent.
China's foreign exchange reserves swelled by $350 billion in the first half of this year -- equal to one-ninth of the country's economic output in the period -- mostly because of this currency market intervention. The Administration of Foreign Exchange also earns interest on its reserves, which totaled $3.2 trillion at the end of June.

HEADLINE: Brief Test of Military Aircraft Said to Yield Much Data

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The military's latest test of the fastest aircraft ever built ended Thursday with the hypersonic vehicle crashing into the Pacific Ocean, although officials said they were able to gather ''unique data'' that will guide the development effort. 
The goal of the project is to enable the military to carry out what it calls a ''prompt global strike.'' If successful, the vehicle would hurl a conventional warhead of enormous weight at high speed and with pinpoint accuracy, generating the localized destructive power of a nuclear warhead.
The Falcon Hypersonic Technology Vehicle 2 was launched aboard a rocket from Vandenberg Air Force Base, northwest of Los Angeles, early Thursday. The launch vehicle was able to push the Falcon into the desired trajectory.
At that point, and after collecting nine minutes of data, the signal to the Falcon was lost, and it apparently crashed into the ocean.
A statement from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is developing the aircraft, said the launching, separation and initial trajectory achieved by the vehicle could be viewed as important successes, despite the modest flight time.
''We know how to boost the aircraft to near space,'' said Maj. Chris Schulz, the program manager. ''We know how to insert the aircraft into atmospheric hypersonic flight. We do not yet know how to achieve the desired control during the aerodynamic phase of flight. It's vexing; I'm confident there is a solution. We have to find it.''
The goal is an aircraft that can fly at 13,000 miles per hour -- enduring temperatures in excess of 3,500 degrees -- and that is able to hit targets anywhere in the world in under an hour.
Military planners say such a vehicle could carry out missions like taking out a North Korean missile while it is being rolled to the launching pad, or destroying an Iranian nuclear site -- all without crossing the nuclear threshold.
In theory, it also could be used against a high-value terrorist target if no other weapons or military force were available or could reach the location in time. The first Falcon was launched in April 2010, and likewise sent back nine minutes of data, including more than two minutes at speeds of up to 22 times the speed of sound, before crashing.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Decline to 4-Month Low

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans claiming new jobless benefits fell to a four-month low last week, the Labor Department said in its weekly report, providing a rare ray of hope for the nation's battered economy. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 7,000 to a seasonally adjusted 395,000, the Labor Department said, the lowest level since early April. Economists had expected a reading of 400,000.
''We are not necessarily on the verge of another dip in economic activity,'' said Millan Mulraine, a senior macro strategist at TD Securities in New York.
''The level of claims at this point is more consistent with at least no deterioration in labor market conditions and at best an economy that is adding jobs at about 200,000'' a month, Mr. Mulraine said.
But the optimism generated by the claims report was damped somewhat by a jump in the trade deficit to $53.1 billion in June, the largest since October 2008, from $50.8 billion in May.
As a result of the wider trade shortfall, economists estimated the government could lower the second-quarter's already weak annual growth rate of 1.3 percent to 0.9 percent.
The government will release its second estimate for second-quarter gross domestic product on Aug. 26. The economy grew at a 0.4 percent rate in the first quarter.
The Federal Reserve said on Tuesday that economic growth was considerably weaker than expected and unemployment would fall only gradually.
Hiring accelerated in July after abruptly slowing in the previous two months. However, there are worries that a sharp sell-off in stocks and the fight between Democrats and Republicans over the government's debt ceiling could curtail employers' enthusiasm to hire new workers.
''The key point here is that a clear downward trend in claims has emerged in recent weeks, even as the debt ceiling chaos reached its peak,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
''We still need to see how the drop in stocks might feed back into claims, but with consumers' spending accelerating in recent weeks, why would firms fire more people?''
An increase in the volume of oil imports pushed the monthly oil import bill in June to its highest since August 2008. That and the second consecutive month of declines in exports contributed to the wider trade deficit in June, the government reported.
Imports from China also rose nearly 5 percent to $34.4 billion, lifting the closely watched trade gap with that country to $26.7 billion, the highest in 10 months.
United States exports fell for a second consecutive month to $170.9 billion, as shipments to Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Japan, France, China and Central America all declined.
''The sharp drop in exports is a major concern for the economic outlook as it is an indication that the pace of global activity may be slowing appreciably,'' Mr. Mulraine at TD Securities said.
Data on Wednesday showed China's exports hit a record high in July as shipments to Europe and the United States proved surprisingly buoyant. July exports rose 20.4 percent from a year ago, the strongest gain since April.

HEADLINE: As Facebook Moves In, Hopes That Progress Follows

BYLINE: By HADLEY ROBINSON. 
hadsrobinson@gmail.com

 BODY:
Three busy traffic arteries border Belle Haven, a Menlo Park neighborhood that has been shut out of Silicon Valley's historic accumulation of wealth.
Belle Haven residents earn less than half as much as other Menlo Park wage earners. Modest homes, some boarded up, line the streets. People swelter under the bright sun as they wait for the bus, because Belle Haven's spartan bus stops provide little shelter.
''You know how normally you have a desert, and in the desert you have a little oasis?'' said Matt Henry, president of the Belle Haven Neighborhood Association. ''With us, it's just the exact opposite. We're here in Silicon Valley, which is absolutely wonderful. But we're the little small desert in the middle of something great.'' Now, Facebook, the world's largest social network, is moving in to the neighborhood.
Facebook has grown to more than 750 million active users and is on the verge of an initial public offering projected to value the company at $100 billion. After outgrowing its Palo Alto headquarters, the company is moving to Belle Haven, where it is creating a campus large enough to accommodate nearly 10,000 employees. The move is to be completed by the end of the year. 
Residents of Belle Haven and its neighbor East Palo Alto, which is also entrenched in an urban malaise, hope Facebook's arrival signals their long-awaited integration into the Silicon Valley economy. They picture the company's wealth and dynamism spreading across the freeways, bringing better housing, services and schools.
''The table is being set for some really great things to happen,'' said Charley Scandlyn, executive director of the Ravenswood Education Foundation, which aims to bring East Palo Alto schools up to the same standards as those in neighboring communities.
''The whole Facebook mission is about connecting people,'' Mr. Scandlyn said. ''Sometimes our kids in East Palo Alto don't feel like they get to be a part of the good dreams in the world. Here is Facebook, that actually gets to live out its mission in its own neighborhood.''
It may not be that easy. Across the Bay Area, cities continue to hope that tech companies will provide the spark for a renaissance in low-income communities. Earlier this year, for example, San Francisco granted Twitter a six-year tax holiday to lure the company to the blighted mid-Market district.
But there is no conclusive evidence that the presence of a technology company can turn a neighborhood or a city around. Google's hometown, Mountain View, still struggles to pay its bills and is threatening to lay off employees, despite the presence of several tech companies, including Google, with a combined value of well over $200 billion. Belle Haven's hopeful uncertainty underscores the growing disconnect between a technology boom fueled by the explosive growth of social media companies and the continuing struggles of the communities in which those companies are located.
According to economists and public officials, the divide is related to the nature of the tech economy, much of which takes place in cyberspace, removed from the world of cash registers, low-income jobs and sales taxes. Companies like Google and Facebook pay property taxes, but cities draw little direct economic benefit from their core businesses. Their highly skilled, highly educated employees commute to lavish, insular campuses where most of their needs are met.
''A social networking company doesn't have as much revenue-generating material,'' said David Johnson, Menlo Park's business development manager.
Still, Mr. Johnson said he was pleased to have found a company to fill the vacated one-million-square-foot property once occupied by Sun Microsystems.
''How can you not be excited about Facebook coming to town -- it's a potential game changer for that whole part of town,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''They are showing all indications of being a great corporate neighbor.''
Menlo Park officials said that as Facebook expanded, the city would have leverage to negotiate additional compensation. The site is currently zoned for 3,600 employees. Once Facebook outgrows that number, ''the city will be looking for something in exchange,'' said Justin Murphy, Menlo Park's development manager.
In its recent approval of a hotel project, the city agreed to alter zoning requirements in exchange for a guarantee that the developer would spend $1.25 million on capital improvements and lock in the amount of revenue the city would receive from a hotel transient tax.
Facebook started moving groups of employees to its new location in July. Company officials said they were just getting to know the neighborhood, attending events like the Menlo Park Block Party in June and talking to City Council members and community leaders.
''We'll try to become part of the community,'' John Tenanes, Facebook's director of facilities, said in an interview. ''We're trying to build the right relationships.''
Many Facebook employees are already volunteering in the community, helping middle school students in East Palo Alto build robots and hosting the East Palo Alto Boys and Girls Club.
The block party was in Menlo Park's bustling downtown, filled with cafes, boutiques and leafy medians. But Belle Haven has a decidedly different feel.
Though crime has decreased in recent years, the neighborhood still has the highest concentration of Menlo Park's crime. Test scores in the Ravenswood School District, shared by Belle Haven and East Palo Alto, were in the bottom 12 percent of California districts in 2010. The Menlo Park district scored in the top 3 percent in the state.
Skeptics note that parents have long found ways to escape the Ravenswood schools. One escape route is the district's two charter schools.
''All of these charter schools are coming in and scooping off the cream, and leaving, basically, the public school system with the poverty-stricken dregs,'' said William Webster, the founder of a community development organization in East Palo Alto and a member of the Rent Stabilization Board.
Although some real estate agents said that a few Facebook employees have asked about houses or rentals in the neighborhood, most agents say they are not getting any such calls. Investors and real estate agents are unsure how many people will move to a neighborhood where crime is high and schools are low-performing, especially with Facebook providing transportation options like car pool matching and shuttles from the Caltrain station.
Michael Pierce, president of the investment group Prodesse Properties, said he did not expect Facebook's move to cause a rush of people to Belle Haven.
''People have said with that close-in real estate, something has got to change, and someday it might happen,'' Mr. Pierce said. ''I wouldn't run out and invest my money there, because there's a lot of risk.''
But some people, like Mr. Scandlyn of the Ravenswood Education Foundation, see signs that the ''someday'' is coming. Mr. Scandlyn pointed to an event this summer in which Facebook volunteers worked in the East Palo Alto schools' technology labs.
''One day,'' he said, ''our schools will not only be achieving but actually reflecting a more diverse world and the world that Facebook is reaching out to.''

HEADLINE: New York's Urban Aloha

BYLINE: By THAD ZIOLKOWSKI. 
Thad Ziolkowski is the author of the memoir ''On a Wave.'' He directs the writing program at Pratt Institute.

 BODY:
WHEN the world's best surfers come to Long Beach, N.Y., next month to compete for a record million-dollar purse in the Quiksilver Pro New York, a new event on professional surfing's world tour, they might be forgiven for using Google Earth to locate the place. Compared with Australia and California and Hawaii, where Quiksilver established its pre-eminence as a beachwear company, New York barely registers on the surfing atlas.
There's good reason for that: the waves are typically pretty meager here, the winters long and stoke-extinguishing. The competition is scheduled for the first two weeks of September, when the odds of hurricane swells are at their statistical best. Still, as locals will tell you, that's quite a roll of the dice. If showcasing the underappreciated athleticism of surfing is the goal, why not hold the contest in, say, Fiji or Mexico, where the waves would be far more likely to prove worthy of the surfers? 
Perhaps because Quiksilver is coming to town less for great surf than for greater market share.
In the past decade or so, surfing has undergone a worldwide boom in popularity, especially among women and urban professionals in their 20s and 30s. Tom Hanks surfs; Cameron Diaz, too. Surf schools and spa-like resorts, the fastest-growing segment of the surf economy, have sprung up, further altering the character of a sport that was once the realm of working- and middle-class adolescent males and young men whose initiations at local beaches were typically prolonged and humiliating.
Meanwhile, older surfers, who in previous generations would have put aside this childish thing, have kept on surfing or returned to it after a hiatus, in large part because of the renaissance of kinder, gentler designs like the longboard and stand-up paddleboard.
As if suddenly remembering that it's a coastal city, New York has been swept up in the urban surf craze along with San Francisco and Los Angeles. And why not? New York may not have abundant, grade-A surf but ridable waves are as close as Far Rockaway, Queens, about an hour from Manhattan on the subway.
In New York City, slipping off to ride waves virtually within view of granite Gotham provides a unique, slightly illicit, dreamlike pleasure. Surfing shouldn't be possible here, and yet it is.
Artists, writers and others in trend-conscious fields are plugged in to New York's surf scene now, but most of the rest of the city is not, and riding the subway with a board clasped to one's chest like a dance partner still elicits smiles and queries from otherwise game-faced straphangers. There is something disarming about the sight of a surfboard in New York, where it has a nutty, quixotic quality, like a pair of wings.
When New York City surfers cross paths, they greet one another, exchange notes. Because so many of them are new to surfing, having taken it up in adulthood, they are less like seen-it-all New Yorkers than surfers in pre-''Gidget'' California, who would pull over when they passed another car of surfers and introduce themselves. Anyone who has surfed in Santa Cruz or Huntington Beach -- chilly, xenophobic ''surf cities'' -- knows how exceptional this urban aloha is.
And if surfing has a soul, it is aloha: welcome, hospitality, generosity without thought of recompense. The word is Hawaiian, of course, and Hawaiians are the ones who gave surfing to the rest of the world. The bitter irony is that the rest of the world returned the favor with a vengeance, and Hawaii's storied line-ups, flooded by outsiders, are now as famous for being jam-packed and short-tempered as for the waves.
Which is why Quiksilver's descent on Long Beach is so ominous. Imprinting the Quiksilver brand on New York's burgeoning surf scene makes perfect sense from a business perspective, but the corporate siren song threatens to sour the mood of surfing in New York, which for the moment remains a bastion of surf spirit. It's a spirit that companies like Quiksilver claim to value but have in fact helped degrade elsewhere, peddling a vision of surfing's blithe, blue allure that studiously omits the ugly realities of overcrowding that such marketing abets.
Come what may in the way of waves next month at Long Beach, Quiksilver will do its utmost to lure more people to the sport -- and to the cash registers. In an atmosphere of staid, commodified carnival, tents will be emblazoned with sponsor names; top pros will sign posters of themselves riding waves that bear scant resemblance to the nearby surf; and swag will be given away to a milling crowd. There will be a few media types and the odd celebrity, including the 10-time world champion Kelly Slater, and young Balaram Stack, a homegrown star.
Even with such talent on offer, the contest itself may well prove a somewhat dull, obscure affair. Surfing just doesn't lend itself naturally to formal competition: waves prove too fickle in the best of conditions, and the judging criteria, periodically rewritten though they are, tend to produce relatively safe, conservative performances. The most avid fans of pro surfing are former pro surfers.
And should a good hurricane swell grace the event, a sizable portion of the audience will probably be catching waves of their own rather than spectating along the boardwalk. From Breezy Point to Montauk, the breaks will be stippled with the seal-like forms of surfers celebrating a spontaneous pagan holiday, work and school happily spurned.
It's not hard to imagine New York's urban aloha going the way of its Polynesian progenitor, but for the moment a genial, just-folks atmosphere reigns. That's because it's still possible to find a bit of ocean to oneself here. And if living in New York proves anything, it's that it only takes a little -- quiet, green, surf -- to suffice.
Would that Quiksilver and its confreres learn the same lesson.

Museums and galleries are in Manhattan unless otherwise noted. Full reviews of recent art shows: nytimes.com/art.
Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Super Stars: Quilts From the American Folk Art Museum' (through Sept. 25) This location is featuring 20 quilts in which stars figure in some way, whether as pieced-together geometric forms or as little tufts of thread that suggest a distant galaxy. American Folk Art Museum Lincoln Square Branch, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) 
- Brooklyn Museum: 'Lorna Simpson: Gathered' (through Aug. 21) Much of Lorna Simpson's photo-based work has been about African-American identity approached from an oblique and elusive perspective. She returns to that theme in new ways in the two installations and video that make up this small show, which includes some 300 framed photographs hung in grid formation on a long gallery wall. Roughly half the pictures are vintage 1950s pinup images of young black women (and a few men) alluringly posed in domestic settings. The rest are of Ms. Simpson herself, posed and dressed like the figures in the photographs, as if to suggest overlooked connections between the present and the past. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
- Brooklyn Museum: 'Vishnu: Hinduism's Blue-Skinned Savior' (through Oct. 2) Hindu sculptures are no ordinary things. Concentrations of spiritual energy so dense as to turn physics inside out, they funnel light from other universes into our mundane world. The light takes a little time to penetrate this show, dauntingly crowded with objects, ideas and information. But it shines through in the end as we trace the many earthly forms taken by one of Hinduism's greatest gods and arrive at the spiritual matinee idol named Krishna. With his sapphire skin and sweet flute songs, he radiates devotional love, and everyone falls for him, including us. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Guggenheim Museum: 'The Hugo Boss Prize 2010: Hans-Peter Feldmann' (through Nov. 2) Mr. Feldmann, the septuagenarian German artist who was the surprise pick for the Boss Prize honors, has decided to exhibit his prize money in the form of 100,000 $1 bills, pinned to the wall of one of the Guggenheim's Tower galleries. What sounds on paper like a conceptual stunt or a riff on Warholian materialism becomes overpoweringly physical in person, thanks to the smell of the used bills and the traces of their circulation. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Guggenheim Museum: 'Lee Ufan: Marking Infinity' (through Sept. 28) This five-decade retrospective fills the museum with about 90 works in a Zen-Minimalist, be-here-now vein by a Korean artist who lives in Paris and Japan. Sculptures consist of ordinary, pumpkin-size boulders juxtaposed with sheets and slabs of dark, glossy steel. Paintings made of wide brush strokes executed in gridded order on raw canvas exemplify tension between action and restraint. In its always near-perfect composure, Mr. Lee's art teeters perilously between art and decor. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Ken Johnson)
- International Center of Photography: 'Elliott Erwitt: Personal Best' (through Aug. 28) Like Henri Cartier-Bresson, Mr. Erwitt seeks ''the decisive moment,'' an instant in real time when people, animals or objects appear before the camera in surprising, funny and illuminating ways. The Henny Youngman of photographic one-liners, he delivers visual humor with such economy and grace that it is easy to overlook just how excellent an artist he is. This show presents more than 100 of his favorite images from the past seven decades. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'Hiroshima: Ground Zero 1945' (through Aug. 28) The contact prints and photographs in this show were made in connection with the 1947 United States Strategic Bombing Survey of Hiroshima and depict the cataclysmic devastation in unflinching detail. The survey texts that accompany the images may appear shockingly clinical. The caption on a picture of a library, or what remains of it, reads: ''Interior first story showing contents damage and spalling of cement plaster by fire. Note all books reduced to ashes.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Rosenberg)
Jewish Museum: 'Collecting Matisse and Modern Masters: The Cone Sisters of Baltimore' (through Sept. 25) This exhibition samples the extraordinary trove of European art amassed by two American spinsters in the first half of the 20th century, work now owned by the Baltimore Museum of Art. Although some major collection highlights are absent, the pieces here -- presented in the order of acquisition -- generate a compelling portrait of the Cones as collectors. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Andean Tunic, 400 B.C.E.-1800 C.E.' (through Sept. 18) This small show celebrates the festive yet functional garments woven south of the equator. To the modern eye, they're wearable paintings; lovers of Keith Haring and Elizabeth Murray will find much to admire. So will anyone interested in the complex relationships among art, clothing, ritual and power. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Anthony Caro on the Roof' (through Oct. 30) No one in the 1960s produced groovier abstract sculpture than the British artist Anthony Caro, five of whose heavy metal assemblages grace the Met's Rooftop Garden. But only one of these works has that startling, newborn feeling. Sporting a new coat of shiny, taxicab-yellow paint, ''Midday'' (1960) has the look of a jaunty, industrial dinosaur. The others, dating from 1968 to 2010, show a development toward an increasingly conservative, ponderous monumentality. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Frans Hals in the Metropolitan Museum' (through Oct. 10) This small but potent show gathers the Met's 11 confirmed works by the great 17th-century Dutch painter, appending them with two outstanding loans and a selection of contextualizing works. It gives a remarkably full account of his talent and the painterly realisms -- vivacious to relatively restrained -- that he formulated. It also reveals an artist who viewed his subjects with a nonjudgmental equanimity, whether he depicted them singly or in groups, in dignified repose or unbridled revelry. As a result, a strange kind of gravity and sympathy for the human condition emanate from these works, raw as they can sometimes seem. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Mother India: The Goddess in Indian Painting' (through Nov. 27) Sculptures, paintings and drawings from the Met's collection represent manifestations of Devi, the Great Mother goddess who is thought to be the most popular of all Indian deities. Among works dating from the first millennium B.C. to 1990 are pieces of exceptional beauty, including a small, 12th-century argillite sculpture depicting the 16-armed Durga slaying her most fearsome opponent, Mahishasura, after he emerges from the lopped neck of his buffalo disguise. Carved in extraordinarily refined detail, it is a marvel of formal and metaphorical concentration. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Night Vision: Photography After Dark' (through Sept. 18) It wasn't until the gelatin dry-plate process was introduced in the late 1880s that exposure time was lowered enough for photographs to be taken regularly after dark. Alfred Stieglitz was among the first to photograph New York at night. His work is shown alongside Berenice Abbott's spectral ''Nightview, New York'' from 1932, taken from the window of a skyscraper; Brassai's nocturnal views of Paris; and Weegee's high-contrast picture of a crime scene. Diane Arbus, Bill Brandt, Robert Frank, Garry Winogrand and Kohei Yoshiyuki are among the other artists included in this modest, lovely show of 40 black-and-white photographs drawn from the museum's collection, which stops a couple of decades short of the present. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Richard Serra Drawing: A Retrospective' (through Aug. 28) Few artists have pushed drawing to such sculptural and even architectural extremes as Mr. Serra, so it makes sense that his adamantine pursuit of the medium, surveyed in an installation that he largely designed himself, is not quite like anything seen at the Met before. There are moments of off-putting starkness on Mr. Serra's side and some of the usual architectural infelicities on the Met's, but as a demonstration of this august institution's willingness to engage with genuinely radical, physically unsettling art of recent vintage, the show is cause for hope. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- MoMA PS1: Ryan Trecartin: 'Any Ever' (through Sept. 3) This game-changing show of seven related videos, viewed amid eccentric seating arrangements procured mostly from Ikea, reflects the combined imagination of a supertalented young artist and his band of merry, cross-dressing pranksters. The results teeter giddily at the intersection of art, reality television and social networking; forge an integration of video and installation art, not to mention a blend of actual life and animation undreamt of by Walt Disney; and evince an aspirational faith in the potential of uninhibited self-expression, both individual and collective, to counter the mounting materialism of everyday life. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, Long Island City, Queens; (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Smith)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'The Age of Elegance: The Joan Taub Ades Collection' (through Aug. 28) This small but engrossing exhibition presents about three dozen works dating from the mid-17th to the late 19th centuries by European artists, each in his own way a draftsman of consummate skill. Some names, like Boucher and Millais, are familiar; most will be known only to art historical specialists. Ranging from postcard to laptop size, including portraiture, still-life and mythological scenes, they exemplify the fine but now endangered art of drawing at its best. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Johnson)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Illuminating Fashion: Dress in the Art of Medieval France and the Netherlands' (through Sept. 4) Medieval illuminations -- so rich in narrative, embellishment and religious expression -- can display sartorial trends that can help experts date manuscripts and discern the subtleties of a figure's status or character. There are many examples here, as well as mannequins in full-scale model attire -- say, a splendid hunting ensemble of gold-embroidered blue velvet and lilac wool felt for the men, and for the women, a princessy gown of yellow silk trimmed in black crushed velvet, accessorized by a turret. This lively show will teach you to scrutinize centuries-old manuscripts as you would a style magazine. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'El Museo's Bienal: The (S) Files 2011' (through Jan. 8) Because of a long renovation of El Museo del Barrio's Fifth Avenue building, four years have passed since the museum's last biannual survey of new Latino, Caribbean and Latin American art. As if to make up for lost time, the new edition is the biggest so far, including work by 75 artists spread over seven shows in four boroughs, with the main event at El Museo itself. The ''S'' this year is for ''Street,'' which covers everything from graffiti to junk sculpture to painted cityscapes, and some of the work has problems with focus. Yet taking the street as a subject opens the possibility to at least think about other subjects, like money for artists, and the lack of it. Other segments of the show are now on display at Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, Queens, and Lehman College Art Gallery in the Bronx; a Brooklyn show is scheduled to start in November. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Arts and Design: 'Otherworldly: Optical Delusions and Small Realities' (through Sept. 18) In the age of the flat screen, a show about the diorama sounds charmingly naive. Yet ''Otherworldly'' circles back to the two-dimensional image in ways that feel very sophisticated. A good number of the show's more than 40 artists build model homes, cities and landscapes mainly to photograph them. At times the exhibition feels like a Hollywood film-studio tour in miniature. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'I Am Still Alive: Politics and Everyday Life in Contemporary Drawing' (through Sept. 19) This show of contemporary drawings (most acquired since 2005) is anchored by a group of telegrams sent by the Japanese artist On Kawara to friends and associates; each one bears the message ''I am still alive.'' The artists seem to be in a permanent state of wariness and suspicion, which is sometimes the result of political instability and at other times more innate. But their efforts to process matters of life and death in short bursts of creative activity feel very of the moment. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Boris Mikhailov: Case History' (through Sept. 5) This exhibition's visceral photographs of homeless people in Ukraine are not for the squeamish. The 19 photos, large-format examples from a series of more than 400 images produced in the late 1990s, portray people in grungy rooms or in wintery outdoor sites naked or pulling aside their clothes to expose parts of their bodies. Thus Mr. Mikhailov protests a society that allows people to fall into such substandard states and conditions. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
- Museum of Modern Art: 'Talk to Me: Design and the Communication Between People and Objects' (through Nov. 7) This broad, ambitious survey of interactive design is made for the texting, tweeting, social-networking, app-downloading, smartphone-wielding museumgoer. Its nearly 200 projects include not only crowd-pleasing video games, robots and chattering objects but also some surprisingly seductive interfaces, charts and information systems -- each with its own hash tag. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
- New Museum: 'Ostalgia' (through Sept. 25) This tough, absorbing exhibition fills all five floors of the New Museum with contemporary art from, or about, Russia and former Soviet bloc countries of Eastern Europe. A fair number of the artists are unfamiliar to New York; some have difficult, even harrowing histories. But a show that could have been a surveyish introduction to them is something more. It's an extended essay about what happens when art and life meet not because it's a cool idea, but because they have no choice: they either join forces or lose everything. New Museum, 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Cory Arcangel: Pro Tools' (through Sept. 11) This solo turn from Mr. Arcangel, the digital wunderkind, artist-musician and inveterate hacker, seems a trifle scrubbed clean, sanitized and austere. Containing work almost entirely from 2011, it tells us little of his funkier early digital efforts or artistic development. A few pieces reflect his longstanding interest in television and video games; in others he tries too hard to establish his formalist bona fides with wry riffs on abstract painting and sculpture. Mr. Arcangel seems guided by a somewhat callow faith in the avant-garde, striving to perpetuate its tradition, dating from Duchamp, of laying claim to new areas of nonart for art's sake. Sometimes he succeeds, but not always. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Breaking Ground: The Whitney's Founding Collection' (through Sept. 18) In anticipation of its move to a new home in 2015, the Whitney is cooking up a series of six back-to-back experimental permanent collection shows at its present location. The first of them is a sampler of the earliest work in the holdings, and as a summary of the institution's initial view of American Modernism, what a curious thing it is. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Lyonel Feininger: At The Edge of the World' (through Oct. 16) This overdue survey is a eye-opener, especially for the rapturous storybook street scenes that Feininger (1871-1956) painted from 1907 to 1911 -- fresh off his triumph as a comic-strip artist and with a big assist from Fauvism's heated palette -- and for the hand-carved and painted toylike figures and buildings that may be his most original response to Cubism. But the show diligently emphasizes the stiltedly mystical Cubified landscapes into which Feininger's painting style hardened after 1918. There's too little evidence of the photographs, woodcuts and pencil sketches that, with the carved sculptures, kept his natural, urbane lightness alive. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)

- Lyonel Feininger: 'Drawings and Watercolors from the Julie Feininger Estate' (through Oct. 15) On the occasion of the Feininger retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art, a gallery long involved with his career presents a parallel survey of works on paper from his widow's estate. It compensates for some of the museum show's shortcomings, most impressively with a gratifying profusion of small, lively woodcut prints from 1918-23 that will be unfamiliar to most viewers.

Galleries: 57th Street
Leo Villareal: 'Volume' (through Aug. 19) You might just want to sit and gaze in blissful stupefaction at ''Cylinder,'' the single-light sculpture featured here. It consists of 160 12-foot-long lengths of shiny stainless steel, each with 140 light-emitting diodes, or LEDs, along one edge, hanging in five concentric circles to create a cylindrical volume nine feet in diameter. The thousands of computer-controlled lights flicker in the darkness, generating all kinds of patterns and a fascinating beauty.

Galleries: Chelsea
'Don't Quit Your Day Job' (through Aug. 19) Among the summer group shows with which art dealers annually break the monthly grind of solo and dual exhibitions, this one achieves an unusual combination of self-conscious modesty and poignancy. It displays 52 photographs taken between 1973 and the present by 19 American art and photography dealers from several generations, and it includes early attempts, private snapshots and homages to other, better-known photographers. The show confirms that great photographer-dealers in the tradition of Alfred Stieglitz are few and far between while also reminding us of the devotion to art and artists that usually guides art dealers to their calling. Hasted Kraeutler, 537 West 24th Street, (212) 627-0006, hastedkraeutler.com. (Smith)
Sol LeWitt: 'Arcs and Lines' (through Aug. 26) This extraordinary show features three gridded wall drawings by the eminent Conceptual-Minimalist Sol LeWitt (1928-2007), most prominently the airy and ebullient ''Wall Drawing #122'' from 1972, a spare work in blue crayon that wraps almost perfectly around the gallery's large central space. Featuring combinations of two straight, wavy, curved or broken lines in each compartment of the grid, its vaulting composition evokes Matisse's blue nudes, brisk Alpine views and even the blinking sweep of a radar screen, exemplifying both the economy and rich suggestiveness of LeWitt's art. Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Smith)
- 'Sigmar Polke: Photoworks, 1964-2000' (through Sept. 3) If this genius of postwar German art, who died last summer at 69, had made no paintings, his wide-ranging photographic work would have assured him a prominent place in history. That's proven by this generous survey -- the first in New York devoted to Polke's photography, the medium perfectly suited his mercurial sensibility. He exploited its ease, immateriality and darkroom processes; spiked it with his works in other mediums (as well as himself); and used it to make his every activity an occasion for making art. His talent for making something from nothing is never more magical. Leo Koenig Inc., 545 West 23rd Street, (212) 334-9255, leokoenig.com. (Smith)
Matthew Ronay: 'Between the Worlds' (through Aug. 19) In this immersive new installation commissioned for Artpace San Antonio, viewers enter a large tent to find a black, white and gray landscape of tree trunks, mushrooms and volcanoes populated by totemic papier-mache figures (one of them inhabited by Mr. Ronay during an opening-night performance). Brimming with references to Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell, it's a little bit like a walk-in version of one of Pollock's early paintings. Andrea Rosen Gallery, 525 West 24th Street, (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com. (Rosenberg)
'Soft Machines' (through Aug. 26) This intermittently interesting show includes a video by the young Chinese artist Ma Qiusha, in which she tells how her parents pressured her to succeed as an artist; it ends with her removing a bloody razor blade from her mouth. A painting by Holton Rower resembles a giant tree slice with psychedelically colorized rings. And Sterling Ruby's pair of pointy-toothed mouths made of stuffed, stars-and-stripes-patterned fabric is like a Bread and Puppet theater prop. Pace, 545 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-4258, thepacegallery.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: SoHo
'The Atomic Explosion: A Collection of Vintage Photographs' (through Sept. 2) This show gathers 66 images of American nuclear tests and detonations, most of them conducted at the Nevada Test Site and on the Marshall Islands during the 1940s and '50s. The massing mushroom clouds in these images, photographed from miles away, are made to seem benignly organic. A giant portobello rises over Bikini Atoll; slender enokis sprout in Nevada. The news-service captions on many of the prints feel just as innocuous; one compares a double-capped cloud to ''a giant dumbbell.'' Peter Blum SoHo, 99 Wooster Street, (212) 343-0441, peterblumgallery.com. (Rosenberg)
'Hilary Lloyd' (through Aug. 21) The British artist Hilary Lloyd makes her New York gallery debut with videos that have the presence of sculptures. Seven sets of monitors, each composed of two or three screens mounted on poles, stand here and there across Artists Space's loftlike premises. Each set of monitors shows images, repeated once or twice, sometimes in slightly different versions. The results could easily feel dry, but don't. You want to see what will happen next, even when you know there's no next. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, at Grand Street, (212) 226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Cotter)

'North by New York: New Nordic Art' (through Aug. 19) Emotional restraint is the rule with this diverse selection of works by 15 contemporary Scandinavian artists. Gunnel Wahlstrand's big, black-and-white, photorealistic ink drawing of a boy in jacket and tie reading at his bedroom desk is technically impressive and coolly depressing. Most engaging is a half-hour video like a home-movie scrapbook called ''My Life'' by Marja Viitahuhta. In a laconic voice-over, a fictional female narrator mentions significant events for each of her 99 years, ending with the stoic statement, ''I die.''

Public Art
'Mark di Suvero at Governors Island: Presented by Storm King Art Center' (through Sept. 25) With 11 works spanning more than three decades, this show organized by Storm King Art Center -- the 500-acre sculpture park in the Hudson Valley -- is Mark di Suvero's biggest New York City survey since 1975. The all-outdoor exhibition works alongside the island's packed calendar of activities and festivals, offering bike riders and picnickers culture by osmosis. Plan to spend some time along the island's southern end, where four of Mr. di Suvero's best sculptures engage the waterfront and one another in invigorating ways. Governors Island, govisland.com. (Rosenberg)
Eva Rothschild: 'Empire' (through Aug. 28) At the southeast entrance to Central Park stands a colorful, tubular structure resembling a swing-set frame designed by spiders on LSD. Touching ground at 10 points on the cobbled plaza, its red, green and black striped posts rise at different angles into an airy web over 18 feet at its highest point. A playful riff on the ancient form of the triumphal arch, ''Empire'' will be a required photo-op for tourists and other visitors. Doris C. Freedman Plaza, Central Park, 60th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Cotter)
Out Of Town
'Blinky Palermo: Retrospective 1964-1977' (through Oct. 31) Already influential at the time of his unexpected death, at 33, in 1977, the German artist Blinky Palermo (born Peter Schwarze) has come to seem essential to an art world obsessed with painting by means other than paint. Much, therefore, is expected of his first full-dress survey in North America. Split between two institutions and further subdivided by medium (cloth pictures and wall drawings at Bard, metal paintings at Dia), the show feels choppy but true to Palermo's geographic and artistic schisms. Dia:Beacon, 3 Beekman Street, Beacon, N.Y., (845) 440-0100, diaart.org; Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Rosenberg)
- Portland Museum of Art: 'John Marin: Modernism at Midcentury' (through Oct. 10) This excellent show focuses on the last two decades of Marin, a painter whom many at the time -- the '30s and '40s -- considered the greatest living American artist. It presents 50 watercolors and oil paintings picturing views around his Cape Split, Me., summer home; his Cliffiside, N.J., winter residence; and Manhattan. Some of the works update Winslow Homer's naturalism, but most teeter on the brink of Cubist-Expressionist abstraction. All are impetuously energetic. 7 Congress Square, Portland, Me., (207) 775-6148, portlandmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute: 'Pissarro's People' (through Oct. 2) The Impressionist Camille Pissarro was, by temperament and belief, a welcomer of people and ideals, and there's an embracing feel to this modest, open-hearted exhibition of paintings and works on paper that demonstrates how central a role the human presence was in the work of an artist usually associated with landscapes. Pissarro's idealism was insistent, sometimes to the point of making his art look bland. But his ethical generosity shines through like good karma and makes him an artist to love. 225 South Street, Williamstown, Mass., (413) 458-2303, clarkart.edu. (Cotter)
Last Chance
- Asia Society and Museum: 'Ai Weiwei: New York Photographs 1983-1993' (closes on Sunday) The Chinese artist-provocateur Ai Weiwei, provisionally released from detention by the Chinese government in June, took the photographs in this exhibition while living in Manhattan for a decade. He moved there from China initially to study art, then casually began recording his daily life with a camera and ended up documenting his East Village neighborhood as it erupted in class warfare. The activist-artist under threat in China today was formed in New York then, as these coming-of-age photographs attest. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Cotter)
'Peggy Bacon & Her Circle' (closes on Thursday) Historically, one of the more ephemeral aspects of art is the social environment that generates it, the networks of artists coming together and drifting apart. So it's heartening when a gallery attempts to reconstruct, however loosely, one of those networks, as Teller does in this small show of drawings and prints centered on the New York artist Peggy Bacon (1895-1987). Susan Teller Gallery, 568 Broadway, room 502A, at Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 941-7335, susantellergallery.com. (Cotter)
- 'The Medicine Bag' (closes on Friday) In this group show of tough little delicacies, differences between self-taught art, outsider art and well-schooled-insider art are pretty much indistinguishable, and artists of different generations, from Joseph Cornell and Lee Godie to youngsters like Paul Lee and Charles Harlan, look like contemporaries. Maccarone, 630 Greenwich Street, West Village, (212) 431-4977, maccarone.net. (Cotter)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Poetry in Clay: Korean Buncheong Ceramics from Leeum, Samsung Museum of Art' (closes on Sunday) This beautiful exhibition presents bottles, vases, bowls and dishes made by 15th- and 16th-century Korean artisans. In shades of gray, from creamy and opalescent off-whites to deep, warm blacks, the anonymous craftsmen covered vessels with loosely rendered images of flora and fauna and fine-grained patterns of dots and tiny blossoms. These infectiously lively works look as if they'd been made not centuries but only decades ago. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
MoMA PS1: 'Nancy Grossman: Heads' (closes on Monday) Anyone passingly familiar with American art of the past half-century will recognize the eerie, erotically menacing, leather-clad heads that Nancy Grossman began producing in the late 1960s. Often including zippers, buckles, straps and chains, these lovingly made sculptures most immediately evoke S&M bondage wear. As presented in this strikingly elegant installation, 14 examples resonate on other metaphorical levels, too. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
- Neuberger Museum of Art: 'Art in Cameroon: Sculptural Dialogues' (closes on Sunday) With 30 sculptures, two from the Neuberger's holdings, this show isn't large, but some of the pieces are spellbinders, given plenty of room to work their magic. Highlights are two figures, one of a man, the other of a woman, both elderly, found in the same area of Cameroon in 1910, taken to different collections in Europe and reunited here, in silent conversation, after some 75 years. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Cotter)
'Perfectly Damaged' (closes on Wednesday) The works by 20 artists in this evocative exhibition are only apparently damaged. Graham Collins subtly alters old, beat-up boards. Valerie Hegarty's portrait of George Washington looks as if it survived a house fire. Michael DeLucia pairs a real, much dented washing machine with a plaster simulation of its undamaged state, suggesting a comparison of the imperfectly real and the Platonic ideal. Derek Eller Gallery, 615 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 206-6411, derekeller.com. (Johnson)
- Jason Polan: 'Living and Working' (closes on Friday) This solo debut introduces an artist who is more or less drawing his way through life, as well as his own show. He will continue adding works to the display, which includes, among much else, a ''life-size'' drawing of the head of King Kong, a decorated but useable table-tennis table and (my favorite) a wall covered with smudgy drawings of dense black circles, large, medium and small. Nicholas Robinson Gallery, 535 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 560-9075, nrgallery.com. (Smith)
- Jo Ractliffe: 'Terras do Fim do Mundo (The Lands of the End of the World)' (closes on Saturday) At first glance, this South African photographer's black-and-white shots of sun-baked Angolan landscapes look random and bland: rocks, dirt, scrubby trees; some handwritten signs but no people. Only when you read some of the titles -- ''Mass Grave at Cassinga,'' ''Minefield Near Mupa'' -- do you learn where people are, or once were, and the pictures snap into expressive focus. The Walther Collection Project Space, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 718, Chelsea, (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: NEW MUSEUM: 'OSTALGIA': (through Sept. 25) This tough, absorbing exhibition fills five floors with contemporary art from, or about, Russia and former Soviet bloc countries of Eastern Europe. A number of the artists are unfamiliar to New York
 some have difficult, even harrowing histories. But a show that could have been a surveyish introduction to them is something more. It's an extended essay about what happens when art and life meet, not because it's a cool idea, but because they have no choice: They either join forces or lose everything.

HEADLINE: Seeking Safety in a Perilous Market: Small Investors Recalibrate After Market Gyrations

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
Small investors' faith in the stock market is being tested again.
After the market rout of 2008 that drastically shrank their retirement nest eggs, small investors withdrew hundreds of billions of dollars from American stock funds, and they kept bolting as the market rebounded sharply for much of last year.
But earlier this year, having missed out on last year's gains, some investors began to tiptoe back in. The timing for those people was off, and now they are being buffeted by the steep drops on Wall Street or bailing altogether. Still others who have been holding on in recent years have had enough.
Lin Hersh, a 61-year-old small-business owner in Bearsville, N.Y., about two hours north of New York City, called up her stock broker two weeks ago and gave the order to sell everything. 
She dumped nearly all of her individual equities and her stock mutual funds, moving almost completely into cash. Ms. Hersh is haunted by the market plunge of 2008, when her $432,000 in savings dwindled to $150,000.
''What I've got left after the last downturn is about a third of what I started out with and I'm not in the mood to play anymore,'' she said. Pointing to the weak American economy and concerns about Europe, Ms. Hersh said she would most likely steer clear of stocks through the end of this year.
''I don't think there's a reason to buy on the dip because the dip isn't done,'' she added.
Small investors provide the bedrock for the United States stock market through their mutual funds, 401(k) plans and other company-sponsored retirement programs. Many have called their stock brokers and financial advisers in recent days, seeking advice or reassurance that their retirements and savings would survive the dives.
The vast majority of small investors have a long-term strategy and are sitting tight. They are not dumping their stocks or mutual funds and, in many cases, continue to pump money into their retirement accounts through employer-sponsored investment plans.
But even before the latest market turmoil, some investors began to look for the exit doors. More than $10 billion was pulled from domestic stock funds in the week that ended Aug. 3, according to the Investment Company Institute. Those levels are double what they were in early July.
And Charles Biderman, the chief executive of TrimTabs Investment Research, estimated that investors probably pulled out another $9 billion this week while the market gyrated wildly.
Just in the last six trading sessions, the whiplash in the Dow Jones industrial average has included three days of either 500-plus or 600-plus dives and two leaps of more than 400 points. Since the beginning of August, the broader Standard & Poor's 500-index has lost 8.8 percent.
Many investors expect continued troubles for stocks. An online survey of investor sentiment this week by the American Association of Individual Investors said that 44 percent of respondents were bearish, expecting the stock market to fall further over the next six months. While that was actually improved from the prior week, it remains well above the survey's historical bearish readings of about 30 percent.
When it comes to domestic stock funds, which manage $4.4 trillion in assets, there have been many more bears than bulls. Those mutual funds have had four consecutive years of outflows, with investors redeeming $448 billion and putting in $104 billion, according to the Investment Company Institute.
In contrast with these longer-term investors, rapid traders have been keen on gambling as Wall Street gyrates.
TD Ameritrade, the online brokerage firm, reported that trading volumes soared into record territory this week as investors clattered and clicked away on their computers. On Monday, when the stock market fell over 600 points, TD Ameritrade processed 900,000 trades, up from an average of 365,000.
''We're seeing a lot of new accounts opening and new asset inflows. People are looking for a bottom,'' said Nicole Sherrod, a managing director of the trader group at TD Ameritrade. ''But for people who stayed in the markets and stayed long, are we seeing some of them exit some positions? Yes. Absolutely.''
After years of underperformance or losses, some investors are questioning whether the long-term outlook that has been drilled into them by Wall Street financial advisers and professionals is really the best advice.
''My wife followed the advice of a financial adviser and she would have been better off putting her money under the mattress. They did nothing but lose money for her over 20 years,'' said Adam Corson-Finnerty, a 67-year-old fund-raiser for the New Jersey Audubon.
Mr. Corson-Finnerty pulled his entire $500,000 retirement account out of the stock market at its peak in 2007 and put it into United States Treasuries and money-market funds.
''Even though we have an adviser who keeps talking stocks to us, we have not gone back because I don't believe in them anymore,'' Mr. Corson-Finnerty said. ''I'm into asset preservation rather than growth.''
Some investors fear that the markets have become dominated by high-frequency traders blitzing in and out of stocks, or by sophisticated hedge funds running mind-bending algorithmic trading programs that can outsmart the ordinary investor.
These people said they feel that the game is rigged and they are the fool.
''I simply have no confidence at all that the markets are fair or that I should be involved in them at all,'' said Lisa Lai, a 63-year-old retiree in the San Francisco Bay area who sold all her equity mutual funds in the fall of 2008 and bought United States Treasuries.
''I don't go to Vegas and gamble with the big-time gamblers there,'' she said.
While holding Treasuries may be a safer bet than stocks, a 10-year note that yields around 2.3 percent is not going to be enough to fund most people's retirement, investment professionals warn.
''We have a bought a lot of dividend-paying stocks,'' said Andy Arkfeld, a financial adviser with Edward Jones in Omaha. ''And when those stocks have gone down, we've bought more shares.''
Mr. Arkfeld said he called 35 of his clients -- mostly small business owners -- on Monday as the market plunged and that 24 directed him to make new investments.
''I didn't have one client sell,'' he said. ''They understand that corporate America is in fine shape. It's just the government that is having issues.''
Kim Butcher was a buyer too. A labor and delivery nurse in Evansville, Ind., who also belongs to two stock investment clubs, Ms. Butcher said she sold a stock that had not performed well about a month ago and sat on the cash, waiting for a break in the market.
Last Friday as the market tumbled, she bought shares of Aflac, Johnson & Johnson, and Berkshire Hathaway.
''I texted a friend of mine on Friday and said, the candy store is open and there's so many choices,'' Ms. Butcher said. ''The only question was could I get to a computer fast enough?''

CORRECTION-DATE: September 28, 2011

 CORRECTION:
An article on Aug. 12 about the response of individual investors to volatility in the stock markets misstated the surname for a nurse in Indiana who purchased shares after a market tumble on Aug. 5. She is Kim Butcher, not Butler. Ms. Butcher called the error to The Times's attention this week.

HEADLINE: European Union Permits Spain To Bar Romanians Seeking Work

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE AND JUDY DEMPSEY

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- In the latest challenge to the European Union's drive toward closer integration, Spain won approval Thursday to keep Romanians from seeking work there, arguing that its battered economy could not absorb fresh inflows of workers.
The decision is the first such and comes at a time of deep soul-searching within the 27-nation bloc, alarmed by the continued impact of the debt crisis on its economy and at the prospect of increased migration following recent upheavals in the Arab world. 
Already, Europe's visa-free travel area, the Schengen zone, has been undermined by friction between France and Italy over migrant flow, and between Denmark and Germany over increased frontier checks, a dispute that worsened this week.
The move Thursday is not related to the Schengen zone but to one of the European Union's four fundamental freedoms, which cover the movement of goods, services, capital and -- as in this case -- people.
Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union in 2007, and Spain allowed their workers access to its labor market two years later. However, Spain has now gone back on that pledge by invoking a special safeguard rule to deal with exceptional circumstances, which was approved by the bloc's executive, the European Commission, on Thursday.
The restriction will apply, in the first instance, until the end of 2012 -- unless the commission's ruling is overturned by a weighted majority of national governments. The ban could then potentially be extended another year.
''It is a backlash that is not really addressing the real problem, which is the lack of more flexible labor markets,'' said Heather Grabbe, director of the Open Society Institute -- Brussels. ''It is a limit on free movement, which is a fundamental underpinning of Europe's single market. What needs to happen is for market problems to be addressed, rather than pushing back on free movement. One of the great strengths of the United States economy is that people can move.''
In a statement, the European Commission said the measure was justified because Spain had the highest unemployment rate in the Union, with more than 20 percent out of a job. The bloc's average is 9.4 percent, while the figure for the nations that use the euro is 9.9 percent.
It added that 191,400 Romanian citizens living in Spain were unemployed in the first quarter of this year, slightly less than one-third of the number of Romanians working in the country. In total, including children and other nonworking family members, there were 823,000 Romanian nationals in Spain on January 1, 2010, though the number coming to the country to seek jobs has fallen in recent years, the commission said.
''This decision has been taken because of the very specific employment situation in Spain,'' the E.U. employment commissioner, Laszlo Andor, said in a statement.
''The Commission understands why, at this particular juncture -- because of the dramatic employment situation and the very complex financial environment -- the Spanish authorities wish to step back from full free movement,'' he added.
The measures do not affect Romanians already in Spain, but those seeking to move there to seek jobs would now need a work contract before settling. Bulgarians, who have settled in much lower numbers, are not affected.
Meanwhile the German government this week criticized plans by Denmark to build new control posts between the two countries, insisting that Copenhagen should wait for approval from the European Commission before taking such measures.
Werner Hoyer, state secretary at the German Foreign Ministry, issued a tough statement saying that last May's unilateral decision to increase customs procedures on the border violated E.U. law.
''There is not the slightest reason now to build parts for a new Danish border control system, which raises considerable doubt with the Schengen treaty, as well as with the European Commission and the German government,'' Mr. Hoyer said.
A Foreign Ministry official, requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue, said Thursday that the government in Berlin was surprised and disappointed that the Danes had begun to build new installations.
Last month, after a visit to Denmark, European Commission experts reported that they were ''unable to get sufficient justifications from the Danish side for the intensification of the controls at the internal borders.''
The decision to step up border controls was the outcome of an agreement between the far right-wing Danish People's Party, or DF, and the Liberal-Conservative government. The DF had campaigned for tighter border controls, claiming they would stop the flow of illegal immigrants. The government agreed to such measures in return for DF support for its budget plan.
The decision, however, has already hurt the tourist industry, with Denmark's summer house rental agencies facing cancellations by Germans.

HEADLINE: Sometimes, Inflation Is Not Evil

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Sometimes, you have to unlearn your lessons.
Thirty years ago, it became clear that defeating inflation was crucial, even if the means needed to accomplish that would cause a deep recession. By the time the European Central Bank was created in the 1990s, it seemed so obvious that inflation must be fought that the bank was given only one mandate -- to fight inflation. The other mandate given to its United States counterpart, the Federal Reserve -- to promote employment -- was pointedly not included.
It is time for a new lesson to be learned. Sometimes we need inflation, and now is such a time.
Had the central bankers of the world understood that inflation in asset prices could be just as bad as, if not worse than, inflation in the prices of consumer goods, this would not be necessary. But they did not. So they did nothing to resist soaring home prices, just as they had seen no reason to worry about the Internet stock bubble. 
When pressed, they would say they knew what to do if an asset bubble did burst -- ease monetary policy. That seemed to work after the Internet bubble burst, and the ensuing recession was a mild one that did little damage to anyone except foolish investors. But the strategy only worsened the housing bubble and has not done much to revive the debt-choked economy over the last two years.
In 2008, when the credit crisis brought the world economy to a screeching halt, governments and central banks stepped in to bail out large financial firms on the theory that a decently functioning financial system was a prerequisite to economic recovery.
That analysis was correct, but there were at least two problems with the fix:
First, at least some banks were not really made healthy again. That was especially true in Europe, where recapitalization of banks proceeded slowly. They were thus vulnerable to a new round of credit worries, this one based on sovereign debt issues.
Second, this country is full of people whose homes are worth less than they owe. That provides threats to the lenders and to the borrowers. Those borrowers need debt relief, but there are many issues that have prevented any real action.
Simply put, you can't operate an economy where huge numbers of people are desperately in debt and have no real way out. We need to either find a way to reduce what they owe or to raise the value of the homes securing the loans, or some of both.
In a column in The Financial Times this week, Ken Rogoff, the Harvard economist, suggested central bankers consider ''the option of trying to achieve some modest deleveraging through moderate inflation of, say, 4 to 6 percent for several years.''
Mr. Rogoff conceded that ''any inflation above 2 percent may seem anathema to those who still remember the anti-inflation wars of the 1970s and 1980s.''
He was right about that.
''I don't think it's a good idea,'' was one of the milder comments I got from the most celebrated veteran of those wars, Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman.
And anyway, he added, ''Right now they probably could not get inflation if they wanted to.'' People are not spending the money they have, he said, adding that the situation reminded him of an era he studied in college -- the Great Depression.
In an interview, Mr. Rogoff recalled how a parade of economists suggested to Japan that it seek to raise inflation to an announced target after its bubble burst, how Japan did nothing of the kind, and how it never really recovered. The Fed, he said, could make clear that it wanted some inflation and would buy Treasuries until it got that result.
''It has to be open-ended,'' he said of such a program, not limited to a certain dollar amount of bond purchases, and it needs to be connected to a stated inflation target. The Fed chairman, he said, could say that ''If and when inflation starts rising above the path I am aiming for, we will taper back bond purchases and raise interest rates to rein it back in.''
As it is, millions of mortgage loans secured by homes are worth far less than the loan amount. That keeps people from moving in search of better opportunities, and it removes an incentive for maintenance spending to preserve the value of the home. Many of those loans will never be paid in full, but there seems to be no route to a quick resolution.
To make things worse, we are still fighting about who should take the losses on those loans, and thus over who is in a position to offer a modification that reduces the amount owed. The banks that packaged the loans in private-label mortgage securitizations are being sued by the buyers of the securities and by insurers who foolishly guaranteed the securities. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are pursuing similar claims for mortgages they guaranteed.
Moreover, state laws vary. In some states, mortgages are secured only by the value of the home, but in others the buyer is personally liable for paying even if the home's value plummets. In nonrecourse states, it would be easier to argue that banks should be willing to offer reductions in the amounts owed.
The Fed has pushed down interest rates to extremely low levels. That means people who have good credit, and homes worth more than they owe, can refinance and save money. But others cannot. One minor step that the president might be able to take without Congressional action would be to require Freddie and Fannie to offer to refinance mortgages they own or have guaranteed even if the collateral is no longer worth what is owed. That would at least pass on some savings to homeowners in distress.
Another idea tossed around has been to have the government force banks to offer principal reductions to underwater borrowers, perhaps in exchange for a portion of any eventual sales proceeds over the new mortgage amount.
Any such proposal runs into issues of fairness and huge difficulties deciding which borrowers would or would not be covered. Fears of moral hazard did not stop the government from assuring that lenders to overleveraged banks were paid back, but it may prevent any plan that would seem to help homeowners who took foolish risks. After all, is it fair to bail out someone who went in over his head while doing nothing for a neighbor who acted responsibly?
A partial way to deal with that would be to allow bankruptcy judges to reduce the amounts owed to market value. Since that would be available only to homeowners who filed for bankruptcy, it would not be available to those with other assets, and presumably the bank would be no worse off than if it foreclosed. But banks fought the idea and Congress refused to include it in the Dodd-Frank law. Mr. Volcker agrees that something needs to be done to reduce mortgage debt, although he points to a long list of obstacles, starting with moral hazard and including worries that banks do not have enough capital to admit how much they have lost. ''But it is going to happen over a period of time,'' he said. ''It would be a good thing if it could be facilitated.''
The chaos that has engulfed financial markets, with new rumors of European bank failures, arose as it became apparent that recovery was unlikely until something was done to write down bad debts, whether American mortgages or Greek government loans, or to make them good again by raising asset values and thus increasing the ability to repay.
And yet the anti-inflation warriors continue to fight old battles. There were three dissents from regional Fed presidents when the Fed promised this week to hold down rates for at least two more years. The European Central Bank has been raising rates on the belief that it must vigorously fight any sign of inflation.
In the future, central banks will have to realize that debt-financed expansions in asset prices can be a threat. For now, it would be nice if they would at least recognize that major deflations in asset prices can be much more important than the relatively small gains in commodities that show up in the Consumer Price Index.

HEADLINE: Darwin

BYLINE: By JEANNETTE CATSOULIS

 BODY:
The 30-odd residents of the tiny town of Darwin, Calif., prefer to keep themselves to themselves, as evidenced by the ''No services ahead'' sign they've erected to discourage visitors. We can only marvel, then, at their candor when faced with Nick Brandestini's camera in ''Darwin,'' a droll and dusty portrait of a place where privacy is prized and boundaries respected. 
Nestled amid the placid, arid landscapes of Death Valley, its only neighbors a top-secret military base and the infamous Barker Ranch, the town manages its own water supply and buries its own dead. In its silver-mining heyday, Darwin thrived on a reputation for debauchery and lawlessness, but today's townsfolk (the film was shot in 2009 and 2010) are an altogether quieter, more thoughtful bunch.
''There are a lot of things we just don't talk about,'' says Monty Brannigan, a former miner, but Mr. Brandestini knows how to listen without visual trickery or manipulative musical cues. Teasing out tales of shady pasts and estranged children, he exposes ever-deeper layers, connecting relationship and genealogy dots gradually and without fanfare. In the background Michael Brook's melancholy score honors a survivalist spirit that draws comfort from inhospitable surroundings.
Whether stockpiling for disaster or just relishing the here and now, Darwin's aging residents -- including an anarchist, a rock artist, a few pagans and a charming lady described on screen as ''Bon Vivant'' -- get by mostly on disability and unemployment checks. The town's lone job belongs to its ornery postmaster, Susan.
''Wild horses couldn't drag me out of Darwin,'' she tells us, and it's a testament to Mr. Brandestini's filmmaking skills that we can perfectly understand why.
DARWIN
Opens on Friday in Manhattan.
Produced, directed and edited by Nick Brandestini; written by Taylor Segrest; director of photography, Mr. Brandestini; music by Michael Brook; released by Nick Brandestini Films. At the IFC Center, 323 Avenue of the Americas, at Third Street, Greenwich Village. Running time: 1 hour 28 minutes. This film is not rated.

HEADLINE: Negative Image Aside, Asian Carp Are a Boon

BYLINE: By DAVID LEPESKA. 
david.lepeska@gmail.com

 BODY:
When federal and state environmental regulators spent a few days at Lake Calumet in Chicago earlier this month fishing for Asian carp with stun guns and half-mile-wide nets, their hunt seemed to underscore the carp's status as the Midwest's ecological enemy No. 1.
The subject of endless debate over the best control strategies, Asian carp, an invasive species, have earned a place of dread in local lore. None, however, were found in the Lake Calumet search, and some scientists say the ecological concerns may be overblown.
For many people, Asian carp are proving more boon than bane. Bolstered by government support, the Asian carp harvest has leapt thirtyfold in the past decade, creating a new industry, attracting fishermen and entrepreneurs, and feeding people all over the world. 
''We've been ramping up for years,'' said Mike Schafer, owner of Schafer Fisheries.
In 2010, the company sold some 20 million pounds of Asian carp to clients as far-flung as Turkey and Indonesia, up from two million pounds in 2006.
''We're out in front,'' Mr. Schafer said, ''and it's going to get bigger.''
In the last year, Illinois has handed out nearly $6 million to increase the catch of Asian carp in the Illinois River, including a $2 million grant to the Big River Fish Corporation, of downstate Pearl, to expand operations and ship up to 50 million pounds a year to China.
A separate $3 million state program aims to further increase the harvest of bighead and silver carp, the two Asian carp species that have infested the Mississippi, Illinois and Ohio Rivers and are nearing the Great Lakes. Both species reproduce quickly, gorge on plankton, a key food for native American fishes, and grow up to 100 pounds.
Kirby Marsden, former president of the Illinois Commercial Fishermen's Association and a part-time consultant for Big River Fish, estimates that the carp harvest, less than half a million pounds in 2000, could grow to an annual catch of 100 million pounds that creates up to 200 new jobs in the next few years.
''It's a chance to get rid of this invasive fish, boost the local economy and increase employment in this area,'' Mr. Marsden said.
Imported in the 1970's by fish farmers and government agencies to keep Southern fish ponds clean, bighead and silver carp escaped their enclosures during flooding and migrated to the Mississippi River, then on to the Illinois and Ohio River basins.
Though they now represent 8 out of every 10 fish in some stretches of the Illinois River, said Greg Sass, director of the Illinois River Biological Survey at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, scientific research has yet to establish a direct connection between the Asian carp proliferation and the decline of any native species.
While scientists debate whether Asian carp could spawn in the Great Lakes and imperil the lakes' $7 billion fishing industries, environmental groups and politicians from six states have called for re-separating Chicago area waterways from the Mississippi River.
The Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee, a task force of more than 20 state, federal and regional officials, is exploring a less drastic measure: increasing the harvest on the Illinois River in sufficient quantities to slow the carp's advance toward Lake Michigan.
''It's no panacea,'' said Joel Brammeier, president of the Alliance for the Great Lakes. ''But in the short run it makes sense. Getting those fish out of the water reduces that northward pressure on Lake Michigan and buys us some time to come up with a permanent solution.''
Jim Garvey, director of the Fisheries and Illinois Aquaculture Center at Southern Illinois University, runs the $3 million state program to increase the carp harvest and develop commercial markets. He says Asian carp, though a hard sell for human appetites in the United States, are among the most widely consumed fish in the world, with China the biggest market.
''It would be silly for our country to have us spend taxpayer dollars to eradicate these things and throw them in a landfill,'' Mr. Garvey said. ''We might as well make some money out of them.''
Orion Briney, a third-generation Illinois River fisherman, agrees. While Mr. Briney hauls in up to 20,000 pounds of Asian carp six days a week, the fish industry has shrunk from a few decades ago, when hundreds of commercial fishermen fished the Illinois. Today, maybe a couple dozen fishermen work full-time.
Mr. Garvey and his team are hoping to double that number with a pilot program set to begin next month. After as many as 25 fishermen are trained to properly catch and handle Asian carp, the state will pay cash awards to those who haul in a certain amount.
A few hundred yards from the Mississippi River, in Thomson, Ill., Schafer Fisheries had dealt solely in catfish for most of its 55 years. Now, Asian carp represent 80 percent of the company's business, Mr. Schafer said.
Schafer ships frozen, filleted, and minced carp mostly to international markets and Asian communities in the United States. It also offers Asian carp jerky, hot dogs and bouillabaisse, and converts waste material into liquid organic fertilizer.
One of Mr. Schafer's main competitors, Stoller Fisheries of Spirit Lake, Iowa, ships about two million pounds of Asian carp each year. The owner, Larry Stoller, says he hopes to increase that number by half next year.
Inland Processing, a start-up in Grafton, Ill., is pitching the state and investors on plans for a plant to process up to 15 million pounds of Asian carp a year.
Big River Fish, meanwhile, is using its state grant to build an 80,000-square-foot plant to open this fall and increase its processing capacity to 2.5 million pounds a month by 2013 from the current 180,000 pounds a month.
Competitors have questioned the state award to Big River Fish because the company's director of international marketing, Ross Harano, was state director of trade from 2003 to 2005. A state official said Mr. Harano's background with the state did not influence the grant decision.
Select Logistics Network of Clinton, Ill., recently won its own state contract: $1 million to remove about three million pounds of Asian carp from the Illinois River and process it into fish meal. Heartland Processing, a start-up in Havana, Ill., is looking to turn carp waste into Omega 3-rich fish oil.
Demand and processing capacity are growing so fast that the Asian carp industry may be working toward its own demise. A state-backed study, to be published at year's end, should reveal whether the increased harvest is reducing carp numbers.
''We want to crash the population,'' said Kevin Irons, aquaculture and aquatic nuisance manager for the Illinois Department of Natural Resources. ''We're not trying to find a sustainable yield.''

HEADLINE: Crop Yield Raises Risk To Food Cost

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
Consumers can expect to see a jump in prices for pasta, meat, vegetable oil and many other grocery items in the coming months as a pair of new government reports forecast on Thursday that a brutal mixture of heat, drought or flooding has taken a toll on the corn, soybeans and wheat grown on American farms.
Futures prices for those important crops jumped on Thursday, and commodities experts said that would lead to higher prices for manufacturers and consumers. 
''The message, based on today's report, is these higher costs should not be expected to abate any time soon,'' said Bill G. Lapp, president of Advanced Economic Solutions, a commodity consulting firm that works with restaurant companies and food manufacturers. ''It implies higher cost forthcoming and subsequent margin pressure, and at some point the need to increase prices at the retail level or on the menus.''
The Agriculture Department's production and supply and demand reports, including information from a survey of farmers and visits to fields, predicted a national average corn yield of 153 bushels an acre, down from nearly 159 bushels in the government's previous forecast. The department also predicted a small drop in the number of acres of corn that would be harvested this fall.
Hot temperatures and below average rainfall will lower yields, the report said. The dry, hot weather increases stress on the corn plant and keeps it from channeling an optimal amount of energy into the formation of kernels, according to Joel C. Widenor, a meteorologist with the Commodity Weather Group, an agricultural consulting firm.
Mr. Widenor said July was the hottest in the Corn Belt states since 1955. It was the fourth-hottest July in the prime corn-growing region in the last 117 years, he said.
The irony in the new forecast was that it still called for a total corn harvest near record levels. Farmers responded to high price expectations this spring by greatly increasing corn acreage, but an extremely large crop was needed to make up for depleted stockpiles which have been reduced by high demand for corn for animal feed and ethanol production. The coming crop will not be big enough to do that, so corn prices will stay high, pushing up prices for other grains, like wheat, as well.
The Agriculture Department's reports also lowered the forecast for soybean yield and the total soybean harvest.
''The extreme blowtorch of heat this summer took our yield down,'' said Don Roose, president of U.S. Commodities, an Iowa commodities broker and consulting firm. ''The wet weather we had early took our harvested acres down. Between the two of them we're in a situation where now we have to ration supplies.''
December corn futures on the Chicago Board of Trade opened by jumping 30 cents, the maximum daily increase allowed, to $7.18 a bushel. Trading ended the day at $7.14. Soybean futures for the November contract opened at $13.53 a bushel, an increase of $0.52. The contract closed at $13.32. Wheat prices also rose, with the September futures contract on the Kansas City Board of Trade closing at $8.08 a bushel, a gain of $0.23.
''The markets over the past couple of weeks have been trying to figure out which is dropping faster, supply or demand,'' said Chad E. Hart, an assistant professor of economics at Iowa State University. He said the U.S.D.A. reports, including the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates known as Wasde, provided an answer: ''What the Wasde report said is, supply.''
High commodity prices will translate into higher meat prices because the cost of feeding cattle, pigs and poultry with grain will go up, forcing producers to raise fewer animals.
And pasta prices will be pushed up because the crop of durum wheat, the variety used to make pasta, is forecast to be almost half as big as last year's, because of flooding in North Dakota.
The average retail pasta price is currently $1.53 a pound, according to the National Pasta Association, a trade group, and Walter N. George, president of the American Italian Pasta Company, said that may eventually increase by 10 to 20 cents.
''The shopper may see slightly higher prices at retail, and over the course of the next 18 months should see those prices begin to come to more normal levels given a replenishment of the durum stocks,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama Urges Voters To Scold Republicans

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
HOLLAND, Mich. -- In the seven days since Standard & Poor's downgraded the country's credit rating, political observers and frustrated Americans alike have asked this same question: Why doesn't President Obama haul lawmakers back to Washington to deal with the worsening economic woes?
On Thursday, Mr. Obama gave his answer. ''The last thing we need is Congress spending more time arguing in D.C.,'' he said in an angry speech before workers and executives at a battery plant here. 
Rather, the president said, echoing what his aides have been saying privately for days, ''What I figure is, they need to spend more time out here, listening to you, and hearing how fed up you are.''
It is a sign, perhaps, of the White House's desperate search for a way forward that Mr. Obama is hoping that American voters -- who are deeply disgusted with Congress, but not exactly thrilled with him either, according to recent polls -- will somehow rise en masse and make their representatives see the error of their ways.
''If they're listening hard enough,'' he said, ''maybe they'll come back ready to compromise, ready to do what you sent them there to do.''
That may be a tall order. Even before Air Force One had left the Washington area on Thursday morning to ferry Mr. Obama here to talk about better fuel efficiency and how his auto bailout had saved the country's car and truck industry, House Republicans were criticizing his trip.
The office of the House majority leader, Eric Cantor of Virginia, put out this statement:
''While the goal of promoting more fuel-efficient vehicles is laudable, such costly new regulations will only create more obstacles to growth and make it harder for working families and small businesses. With 10.5 percent unemployment in the Great Lakes State, the president should explain to people of Michigan how his calls for tax increases and new regulations will create jobs or spur economic growth.''
And, lest anyone think that Republicans were having any second thoughts after Mr. Obama spoke, Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, lobbed this statement: ''President Obama likes to talk about being 'the adult in the room'--but there's nothing 'adult' about political grandstanding. If the president wants to do something productive, he can start by delivering on his promise to outline his own recommendations to rein in the massive deficits and debt that are undermining job creation in our country.''
For Mr. Obama, Thursday's trip, coming at perhaps the lowest point in his presidency, was a chance to try to regain his footing and present himself as an assured leader with programs and proposals that will help put the American economy back on track and make the country more competitive globally.
But Mr. Obama spent most of his remarks assailing the Congressional Republicans who have knocked down most of his proposals. At times, the president sounded angry, noteworthy since he is famous for rarely losing his cool. He called the credit downgrade ''a self-inflicted wound,'' and added: ''That's why people are frustrated. You can hear it in my voice; that's why I'm frustrated.''
''There's nothing wrong with our country,'' Mr. Obama said, speaking at Johnson Controls, a maker of battery systems. ''There's something wrong with our politics.''
Mr. Obama characterized the last few months in Washington as the ''worst kind of partisanship, the worst kind of gridlock,'' which he said had ''made things worse instead of better.''
He reiterated his calls for an extension of the payroll tax cut, and for a road construction bill, intended to get workers back on the job on infrastructure projects. Of course, those ideas would need Congressional approval.
After Michigan, Mr. Obama headed to New York to attend two Democratic fund-raisers to bring in money for the 2012 elections. That leg of his trip coincided with the Republican presidential debate in Iowa on Thursday night.
The White House press secretary, Jay Carney, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Michigan, said he was curious ''whether anyone participating in the debate tonight will have any concrete proposals.''
White House officials seemed visibly happy to get out of Washington on Thursday; and they can look forward to the president's two-day bus tour in the Midwest next week, and another chance to listen to people who do not work on Capitol Hill.

HEADLINE: Nobel Laureates Here, Grinding Poverty There

BYLINE: By JAMES WARREN. 
jwarren@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
James Warren writes a column for the Chicago News Cooperative.
Will Burns is well versed in the theory and practice of American politics, but he concedes that nothing quite prepared him to be the new alderman of Chicago's diverse, somber South Side Fourth Ward.
''It's the city's political culture,'' Mr. Burns, a former state representative, said last week as he chronicled his early aldermanic odyssey. ''It's a big thing in the 'burbs to be a state senator or representative, but in the city, people tend not to care about state government. Your point of contact is the alderman.'' 
Mr. Burns, 38, is from Cleveland, where his father, now deceased, was a police sergeant and his mother a social worker. He came to town to attend the University of Chicago, and while doing graduate work in political science, he worked part time for a little-known state senator named Barack Obama, later getting a job in Mr. Obama's Chicago office.
He went to work for Emil Jones, an influential Obama mentor who was then a state senator, serving as an analyst and helping to oversee south suburban political campaigns before returning to Mr. Obama and that disastrous 2000 congressional campaign against Bobby Rush, the incumbent. Mr. Burns moved on to policy jobs at the Metropolitan Planning Council and the Chicago Urban League before circling back to Mr. Jones and entering elective politics himself, winning two races as state representative from Hyde Park.
His reputation was as a smart and thoughtful comer and solid liberal Democrat. And his unusual lateral move, exiting the often soul-deadening and commute-filled universe of Springfield, is intriguing.
On a recent day, there was a meeting about a forthcoming annual African arts festival in Washington Park, homage paid to the Rev. Jesse Jackson by showing up at an Operation Push lunch, a quickie appearance at a community garden overseen by the Chicago Botanic Garden at Dyett High School and a discussion of gang violence on West 51st Street, a stone's throw from the fresh kale and tomatoes.
Mr. Burns's new lair is more diverse than any South Side or Hyde Park caricatures might suggest. The ward includes the Nobel laureates at the university, a solid black middle class and a grinding, grim, self-reinforcing poverty. The bucolic vegetable garden at Dyett, an all-too-typically underperforming school, and the nearby gangs are vivid ingredients of a big urban stew.
Tabs may be kept on Mr. Burns, since, as the recent mayoral election underscored, there are political fractures among blacks of a class- and generational-based sort. There are no obvious black leaders, except the absentee Mr. Obama and, maybe, Mr. Burns's aldermanic predecessor and ally, Toni Preckwinkle, the hard-working and reformist new president of the Cook County Board, who follows the inept act of Todd Stroger.
Outside of some labor unions, few organizations forcefully advocate for the poor with discernible impact. It remains to be seen if Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who did well among black voters, can alter the hideously shameful poverty and segregation.
Mr. Burns jokes about how campaign phone calls to undecided voters took two minutes when he was a state representative, but with aldermanic voters, it's more like 10 minutes, because of the citizens' far greater engagement in and knowledge of their ward.
Whether potholes, broken street lights, sewer repairs, gangs or permits for sidewalk cafes, ''you're on the front lines,'' Mr. Burns says. ''People come to your office and scream. They don't go down to City Hall.''
Given the skulduggery that plays out with the lessened news media in Springfield, it's unfortunate that the capital is ''200 miles away and might as well be the dark side of the moon'' to most people, as Mr. Burns put it. Instead, he said, Chicagoans turn to the alderman, who must operate ''like a cop without a gun, a social worker without a license.''
In these early stages, he operates with visions for improvement, notably economic growth. He's noodling about developing the arts, including a tax credit plan for developers who set aside living spaces for artists.
Having groused to my North Side alderman about pervasive city incompetence, I'll wager that the job gets tougher. Even for Mr. Emanuel and his many bright and energetic acolytes, there will be limits to greater efficiencies and bureaucratic reinvention.
We had best lower our expectations of government's breadth, even when the recession really ends. Mr. Burns, a very sharp and ambitious fellow, had best get used to the screaming.

HEADLINE: Portrait of Hard Times as Jobs Fair Draws Thousands

BYLINE: By DON TERRY. 
dterry@chicagonewscoop.org

 BODY:
This is what hard times look like: By mid-morning Tuesday, a line of job seekers waiting for admission to a transportation-industry jobs fair sponsored by President Obama's hometown congressman, Representative Bobby L. Rush, stretched for more than half a mile under a blazing sun across the campus of Chicago State University on the South Side.
It took nearly five minutes to walk from the beginning of the line, past at least seven university buildings, to its end. Jobless person after jobless person had filled the university's 2,700-space parking lot, and hundreds more had parked cars along the side of the access road. 
By the time the jobs fair closed at 4 p.m., up to 9,000 people had walked the line, said Mr. Rush's spokeswoman, Renee Ferguson. ''I go to job fairs all over the country but I've never seen one this big,'' said Rodrigo Cervantes, a recruiter for Southwest Airlines, one of 29 transportation companies represented at the event.
The line began to take shape at 5 a.m. when Stephanie Watson, a 20-year-old former fast food worker, was the first person to arrive. ''I want to work,'' she said. ''It's hard to find good jobs these days, so I made sure I was here bright and early. Bills keep on coming.''
Candace Mitchell, 28, an independent hairstylist who said she worked from her apartment and lived ''hairdo by hairdo,'' said she believed troubles wouldn't end even for people who got new jobs. With gas around $4 a gallon, poorer Americans have to make ''life decisions at the gas pump.''
''It's either dinner or it's gas to get back home,'' she said. ''It's either my son's football uniform or gas to get back home. It's either going to the doctor or gas to get back home.''
Job seekers disagreed over whom to blame -- President Obama, the current occupant of the White House, or George W. Bush, who left office as the economic crisis started. Desiree Mitchell concluded that it did not matter which political party was in the White House, ''I feel we're out here fending for ourselves.''
Velvet Hays-Dawson, 58, a former hospital phlebotomist, and her daughter Jessica Dawson, 21, arrived at 6:30 a.m. Mrs. Hays-Dawson's husband drives a C.T.A. bus and is ''the only check'' in the family, she said.
Their home is in foreclosure. When the youngest daughter, Janelle, 19, reached college age, the family faced a decision: tuition or mortgage. ''We made the decision to push her on into college,'' Mrs. Hays-Dawson said. ''Now we're really in the hole.''
Just before the doors opened, Chicago State's president, Wayne Watson, shook hands with job seekers and encouraged those without college degrees to enroll in ''one of Chicago's excellent community colleges or universities as soon as you can.''
Inside the center, where the Chicago State Cougars play basketball, Mr. Rush told the first 1,500 people through the door that the transportation companies in attendance, like Greyhound Lines, the C.T.A. and Norfolk Southern Railroad, were serious about hiring.
Then he began chanting ''Let's go to work; let's go to work,'' and the jobs fair began.
John Banks, 43, headed for the Norfolk Southern table. Jobless for 18 months, he said he last worked at Wal-Mart, earning about $800 every two weeks before he was laid off.
He has put in at least 150 online job applications and gotten a few callbacks, he said, but almost always for sales jobs.
''With the way the economy is, people aren't buying stuff,'' Mr. Banks said. ''You can't live off of sales commissions when you're not selling.''
Job seekers had been told to bring their resumes, but many people said company representatives had instructed them to apply online instead. ''I could have stayed home and not wasted my time,'' one man said bitterly.
A Norfolk Southern recruiter said the company received up to 7,000 online applications a week, from which it hired about 80 people.
Ray Abrams, 45, had left his Park Forest home at 3:30 a.m. to be among the first in line. He said he planned to apply online to Norfolk Southern.
''I thought they would be hiring people on the spot,'' Mr. Abrams said. ''Yeah, I'm a little disappointed. But I got some good leads. I'm happy I came. I'm going to apply online, and then I'm going to bug them. I'm going to call them every day until they hire me.''

HEADLINE: 'Corporations Are People,' Romney Tells Iowa Hecklers Angry Over His Tax Policy

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Emerging on the campaign trail in Iowa after largely shunning the state, Mitt Romney was confronted on Thursday by hecklers on corporate tax policy and told one of them, ''Corporations are people, my friend.''
Mr. Romney was speaking at the Iowa State Fair's soapbox on Thursday morning, but when it was time for the question-and-answer session, the mood turned heated, with a small group of angry hecklers calling on Mr. Romney to support raising taxes on the wealthy to help finance social entitlement programs. 
''We have to make sure that the promises we make in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are promises we can keep, and there are various ways of doing that,'' Mr. Romney said. ''One is, we can raise taxes on people.''
''Corporations!'' the protesters shouted, suggesting that Mr. Romney, as president, should raise taxes on large businesses.
''Corporations are people, my friend,'' Mr. Romney responded, as the hecklers shouted back, ''No, they're not!''
''Of course they are,'' Mr. Romney said, chuckling slightly. ''Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to people. Where do you think it goes?''
It was a telling, unscripted moment for Mr. Romney likely to be replayed on YouTube. In an instant, he seemed to humanize himself by pointedly squabbling with the group of hecklers, showing flashes of anger and defying his reputation as a sometimes stilted, unfeeling candidate.
But at the same time, he seemed to reinforce another image of himself: as an out-of-touch businessman who sees the world from the executive suite.
Mr. Romney's remarks drew a quick response from Democratic Party officials. ''It is a shocking admission from a candidate -- and a party -- that shamelessly puts forward policies to help large corporations and the wealthiest Americans at the expense of the middle class, seniors and students,'' said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee.
The remarks and the reaction touch a sensitive spot. Mr. Romney's past as co-founder of Bain Capital, a private equity firm, gives him the business credentials that he says are needed to steer a troubled economy. But Democrats have depicted Bain under his tenure as destroying jobs through corporate takeovers in search of profits.
Thursday was Mr. Romney's most fiery day on the trail this week, even before the hecklers, affiliated with Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement, an organizing group, drew him into several aggressive exchanges. Mr. Romney took the stage with sweat already glistening on his brow and upper lip. The sweat trickled down his cheek as he worked himself into animated rhythm in a 10-minute speech that criticized President Obama.
''We're led by a man who is a fine fella, but he's out of his depth and doesn't understand how the economy works,'' said Mr. Romney, who is leading the Republican field in many polls but is not taking part in Saturday's Iowa straw poll.
When the questions turned combative, Mr. Romney held his ground. ''If you want to speak, you can speak, but right now it's my turn,'' he said to applause, leaning into the crowd to cut off an elderly man who was yelling at him about Social Security.
''You came here to listen!'' the man retorted, to which Mr. Romney replied: ''No, no, I came here to talk. Hold on a second, let me speak.''
When he realized he wasn't changing any hecklers' minds, he said they were free to vote for someone else. ''I'm not going to raise taxes -- that's my answer,'' he said. ''And if you want someone who can raise taxes, you can vote for Barack Obama.''

HEADLINE: The Hijacked Crisis

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Has market turmoil left you feeling afraid? Well, it should. Clearly, the economic crisis that began in 2008 is by no means over.
But there's another emotion you should feel: anger. For what we're seeing now is what happens when influential people exploit a crisis rather than try to solve it.
For more than a year and a half -- ever since President Obama chose to make deficits, not jobs, the central focus of the 2010 State of the Union address -- we've had a public conversation that has been dominated by budget concerns, while almost ignoring unemployment. The supposedly urgent need to reduce deficits has so dominated the discourse that on Monday, in the midst of a market panic, Mr. Obama devoted most of his remarks to the deficit rather than to the clear and present danger of renewed recession. 
What made this so bizarre was the fact that markets were signaling, as clearly as anyone could ask, that unemployment rather than deficits is our biggest problem. Bear in mind that deficit hawks have been warning for years that interest rates on U.S. government debt would soar any day now; the threat from the bond market was supposed to be the reason that we must slash the deficit now now now. But that threat keeps not materializing. And, this week, on the heels of a downgrade that was supposed to scare bond investors, those interest rates actually plunged to record lows.
What the market was saying -- almost shouting -- was, ''We're not worried about the deficit! We're worried about the weak economy!'' For a weak economy means both low interest rates and a lack of business opportunities, which, in turn, means that government bonds become an attractive investment even at very low yields. If the downgrade of U.S. debt had any effect at all, it was to reinforce fears of austerity policies that will make the economy even weaker.
So how did Washington discourse come to be dominated by the wrong issue?
Hard-line Republicans have, of course, played a role. Although they don't seem to truly care about deficits -- try suggesting any rise in taxes on the rich -- they have found harping on deficits a useful way to attack government programs.
But our discourse wouldn't have gone so far off-track if other influential people hadn't been eager to change the subject away from jobs, even in the face of 9 percent unemployment, and to hijack the crisis on behalf of their pre-existing agendas.
Check out the opinion page of any major newspaper, or listen to any news-discussion program, and you're likely to encounter some self-proclaimed centrist declaring that there are no short-run fixes for our economic difficulties, that the responsible thing is to focus on long-run solutions and, in particular, on ''entitlement reform'' -- that is, cuts in Social Security and Medicare. And when you do encounter such a person, you should be aware that people like that are a major reason we're in so much trouble.
For the fact is that right now the economy desperately needs a short-run fix. When you're bleeding profusely from an open wound, you want a doctor who binds that wound up, not a doctor who lectures you on the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle as you get older. When millions of willing and able workers are unemployed, and economic potential is going to waste to the tune of almost $1 trillion a year, you want policy makers who work on a fast recovery, not people who lecture you on the need for long-run fiscal sustainability.
Unfortunately, giving lectures on long-run fiscal sustainability is a fashionable Washington pastime; it's what people who want to sound serious do to demonstrate their seriousness. So when the crisis struck and led to big budget deficits -- because that's what happens when the economy shrinks and revenue plunges -- many members of our policy elite were all too eager to seize on those deficits as an excuse to change the subject from jobs to their favorite hobbyhorse. And the economy continued to bleed.
What would a real response to our problems involve? First of all, it would involve more, not less, government spending for the time being -- with mass unemployment and incredibly low borrowing costs, we should be rebuilding our schools, our roads, our water systems and more. It would involve aggressive moves to reduce household debt via mortgage forgiveness and refinancing. And it would involve an all-out effort by the Federal Reserve to get the economy moving, with the deliberate goal of generating higher inflation to help alleviate debt problems.
The usual suspects will, of course, denounce such ideas as irresponsible. But you know what's really irresponsible? Hijacking the debate over a crisis to push for the same things you were advocating before the crisis, and letting the economy continue to bleed.

HEADLINE: Pelosi Appoints 3 on Her Team to Complete the Deficit-Reduction Committee

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi, rounded out the membership of a powerful new deficit-reduction panel on Thursday by appointing three of her top lieutenants who have led opposition to cuts in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.
The new appointees are Representatives Xavier Becerra of California, the vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus; James E. Clyburn of South Carolina, the assistant House Democratic leader; and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee.
In announcing her picks, Ms. Pelosi said the new panel, the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, must find ways to stimulate economic growth and create jobs.
Mr. Van Hollen articulated the Democrats' theme: ''Putting America back to work is the best and most immediate way to reduce our deficit.'' 
Within hours of the announcement, the Investment Company Institute, a trade association for mutual fund companies, sent out invitations to a fund-raiser for Mr. Becerra prominently citing his role on the panel.
''This will be Mr. Becerra's first event since being named'' to the panel and ''could give all attendees a glimpse into what will most assuredly be the primary topic of discussion between now and the end of the year,'' said invitations to the Aug. 31 event, sent by James R. Hart, a lobbyist for the institute. The suggested contribution is $1,500 a person.
The event was planned before Mr. Becerra's selection. Ianthe Zabel, a spokeswoman for the institute, said the group ''takes full responsibility for the language in the outgoing e-mail and the decision to send it out Thursday afternoon.''
The invitations illustrate the lobbying frenzy touched off by the new panel, which will have wide latitude to propose changes in tax policy and spending, including entitlement programs and the Pentagon budget. A bill written by the panel would not be open to amendment and would go onto a fast track intended to guarantee that both houses of Congress vote on it by Dec. 23.
With the 12 panel members now named, lawmakers and lobbyists were trying to calculate its chances for success.
The panel members are all team players. They represent their caucuses and the Congressional leaders who appointed them. Prospects for a deal thus depend on the leadership of both parties. It is difficult to envision an agreement without their support.
Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, is a loyal lieutenant of the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, and is unlikely to agree to any compromise that would displease him.
A co-chairwoman of the panel, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, is a member of the Senate Democratic leadership team and is likely to discourage other Democrats on the panel from straying from the party line.
Republicans have criticized the selection of Mrs. Murray because she is also the chairwoman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which is largely focused on helping vulnerable Democratic senators up for re-election in 2012.
Among Democratic women, there was some grumbling that the criticism of Mrs. Murray was unfair and smacked of sexism. ''There isn't one member who is sitting on that supercommittee that isn't trying to elect their own candidates to the House and Senate,'' said Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California. ''The Republicans had the opportunity to name women and minorities to this committee, and they didn't do that. They should ask themselves why their appointees don't reflect the makeup of this country.''
Some panel members, like Mr. Becerra and the Republican co-chairman, Representative Jeb Hensarling of Texas, have over the years repeatedly highlighted differences between the parties on issues that will preoccupy the committee for the next 15 weeks.
If a majority of the panel reaches agreement, lawmakers said, it is likely to grow out of a consensus fostered by a handful of potential dealmakers like Senators John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio.
Two other panel members who lead the tax-writing committees of Congress could conceivably nudge the group toward a deal that raises revenue without increasing tax rates. Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, and Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, have held many hearings on proposals to overhaul the tax code.
Mr. Camp said Thursday that he would not rule out tax changes that generate additional revenue as a result of economic growth.
''I don't want to rule anything in or out,'' Mr. Camp said in an interview with Reuters. ''I am willing to discuss all issues that might help us reduce our short- and long-term debt and grow our economy. Everything is on the table, until we as a group rule it out.''
''Economic growth and job creation in the private sector -- that's what we need to use as a benchmark about any policy, but particularly tax policy,'' Mr. Camp added.
President Obama and Democratic leaders in Congress say additional revenue must be part of any deficit-reduction deal. Republicans have adamantly opposed tax increases.
The economic malaise in the United States and the debt crisis in Europe could jolt some panel members out of entrenched positions. Pressure for a deal may also come from investors and credit rating agencies like Standard & Poor's, which cited ''political risks'' and the rising debt burden in the United States when it lowered its rating of long-term Treasury securities last week.
The new deficit-reduction law could also prompt panel members to seek a deal because if they fail to agree, the government would cut spending across the board in a wide range of popular programs.
Mr. Becerra is the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security. He sharply criticized a proposal, advanced by White House officials, to reduce the annual cost-of-living adjustment in Social Security benefits by using a different measure of inflation.
Mr. Van Hollen led opposition to the budget blueprint that Republicans pushed through the House in April. He said the Republican plan would savage Medicare by giving each beneficiary a fixed, inadequate amount of money to buy private insurance.
As the House Democratic whip in 2009-10, Mr. Clyburn helped pass Mr. Obama's health care overhaul, which was approved on a party-line vote without Republican support.
In a joint statement on Thursday, 23 Democratic senators said the new panel should ''put jobs first'' and ''explicitly embrace job creation as a part of its mission.''
''The single best deficit-reduction strategy is economic growth,'' the group said in a letter to Mr. McConnell.
The Democratic senators, led by Jeff Merkley of Oregon, said that putting people back to work would reduce federal spending by reducing the demand for unemployment benefits, food stamps, Medicaid and other assistance.

HEADLINE: Cameron, in Speech, Pledges Swift Reaction to Rioters

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, ALAN COWELL and RAVI SOMAIYA; John F. Burns and Ravi Somaiya reported from London and Alan Cowell from Paris.

 BODY:
LONDON -- Seeking to reestablish his authority after England's worst rioting in decades, Prime Minister David Cameron told an emergency session of Parliament on Thursday that the authorities would consider curfews, constraining smartphones and social networking sites, and filling some police functions with soldiers to keep more officers on the street.
He also said that he would consult a former New York City police commissioner, William J. Bratton, who presided over a record drop in crime there in the 1990's, on ways to counter criminal gangs.
Mr. Cameron said the police were authorized to use plastic-coated bullets against rioters and that plans were in place to deploy water cannons when appropriate. ''Nothing should be off the table,'' he said. ''Every contingency is being looked at.'' 
He promised ''swift justice,'' even as the authorities turned to a tough reckoning after the days of rioting, looting and arson, with courts in several cities sitting through the night. The police said that over 1,200 people had been arrested, most in London, since the frenzy of violence broke out on Saturday. The situation eased only after thousands of police reinforcements flooded the streets of London and major cities.
The convulsions of violence prompted widespread criticism of the police for an ineffective initial response and deeper failures including corruption and collusion exposed by the broadening phone hacking scandal. Few members of British society were spared: politicians came under fire for failing to break off summer vacations immediately to confront events; and they in turn denounced a society that has allowed hooliganism, public drunkenness, and gang culture, including thuggish behavior toward the weak and disabled.
Mr. Cameron echoed some of those criticisms himself in the marathon appearance in Parliament on Thursday, wrapping himself in his Conservative party's law-and-order banner to grapple for almost three hours with his most serious political challenge since taking office in May 2010.
For the first time, Mr. Cameron said police commanders had acknowledged that they had misjudged the situation at first and deployed too few officers.
''Initially the police treated the situation too much as a public order issue, rather than essentially one of crime,'' he told the summoned lawmakers, blaming a wide social breakdown for the violence.
''This is not about poverty, it's about culture,'' he said, ''a culture that glorifies violence, shows disrespect to authority, and says everything about rights but nothing about responsibilities.''
''We will not let a violent few beat us,'' Mr. Cameron told the summoned lawmakers. ''We will not put up with this in our country. We will not allow a culture of fear to exist on our streets and we will do whatever it takes to restore law and order and to rebuild our communities.''
''We need to show the world, which has looked on frankly appalled, that the perpetrators of the violence we have seen on our streets are not in any way representative of our country -- nor of our young people,'' he said. ''We need to show them that we will address our broken society, we will restore a stronger sense of morality and responsibility -- in every town, in every street and in every estate.''
The violence started in the gritty north London neighborhood of Tottenham, after a lethal police shooting. Mr. Cameron said there was ''some evidence'' that criminal gangs had been behind the wave of arson and looting that ensued. Mr. Cameron said he would consult Mr. Bratton, who presided over a major drop in crime in New York City in the mid-1990's, headed police forces in Boston and Los Angeles, and is now chairman of a New York-based security company, Kroll Associates, that advises police forces around the world.
Mr. Cameron had also recently mentioned Mr. Bratton in connection with the hunt for new leadership at Scotland Yard, as London's Metropolitan Police is known. The force has been shaken by the scandal over phone hacking; its top two officials have resigned and its longtime spokesman was placed on extended leave as investigations continued into earlier flawed police inquiries into the hacking and accusations of police bribery.
But the idea of nominating Mr. Bratton met with strong resistance from British police authorities and others who said the head of the Scotland Yard was by tradition a Briton.
On Thursday, the London police said 922 people had been arrested and 401 charged with offenses since the violence took root on Saturday, while the Manchester police in the northwest put the total of arrests there at 145, with similar numbers detained in Birmingham in the English Midlands. Courts in London and Birmingham sat through the night. With thousands of police reinforcement on the streets, heavy rain in some areas and residents in some places patrolling their own residential areas, there were no new reports of major violence overnight.
Despite the apparent lull, concern was growing about many of the ethnically segregated districts battered by the rampages, particularly Birmingham, Britain's second-largest city, where the police and political leaders worried about a potentially explosive new pattern of interracial violence that could be set off by the past days and nights of mayhem.
Three young men of Pakistani descent were killed in Birmingham on Tuesday night when a car crashed into a group of residents who had gathered to protect local businesses from attack. Witnesses said that the driver appeared to be of Afro-Caribbean descent, and the police arrested a 32-year-old man and charged him with murder.
In Parliament on Thursday, Mr. Cameron faced pressure from the Labour Party -- and from his fellow Conservative, the London mayor Boris Johnson -- to reverse cuts in police budgets ordered as part of broad austerity measures designed to reduce the government deficit. In response, though, Mr. Cameron told lawmakers that his government's proposed 6 percent cut in police spending should be possible ''while keeping police visibility up'' through greater efficiencies.
While many Britons had initially blamed the violence on unemployed youth, one surprise was the presence in courts of young men and women with regular jobs among the riot suspects lined up in police wagons outside courthouses in London and other cities. That raised questions about why they had been caught up in the kind of mayhem that has traditionally drawn on an underclass of alienated young people, with no jobs and few prospects.
Many of those who were remanded for trial appeared to come from just those kinds of backgrounds -- evidence, as some commentators saw it, that the root causes of the disorders lay in social deprivation and despair. But those who stood before the courts for bail hearings in London, many of them still in their jeans and hooded sweatshirts, included a graphic designer, a postal employee, a dental assistant, a teaching aide, a forklift driver and a youth worker.
One 19-year-old woman was listed on court documents as living in a converted farmhouse in a leafy, upmarket area of rural Kent that is part of what Londoners call the stockbroker belt. A 22-year-old woman gave her address as an upscale block of flats in a gentrified neighborhood of Hackney, one of the worst-hit riot areas in London. Local residents said that many of the residents of the apartments, which are valued at about $500,000, belonged to a community of affluent, middle-class people with jobs in London's news media and art world.
''There are pockets of our society that are not just broken but, frankly, sick,'' Mr. Cameron said. ''The sight of those young people running down streets, smashing windows, taking property, looting, laughing as they go, the problem of that is a complete lack of responsibility, a lack of proper parenting, a lack of proper upbringing, a lack of proper ethics, a lack of proper morals,'' he continued. ''That is what we need to change. There is no one trigger that can change these things. It's about parenting, it's about discipline in schools, it's about making sure we have a welfare system that does not reward idleness. It is all of those things.''
For now, the political sparring has taken a back seat to more immediate concerns, especially the signs of rising tensions between ethnic groups in neighborhoods under siege. Earlier in the week, Turkish groups in Hackney and other London neighborhoods began arming themselves with aluminum baseball bats and other weapons to protect their homes and businesses. In the neighborhood of Southall, a crowd of Sikhs gathered at a temple where their spiritual leader vowed to fight back against any groups that threatened the temple or Sikh neighborhoods.
Similar vows were made by Muslim groups in a wide array of mixed-race communities in London and in at least two other cities with large Muslim populations -- Birmingham and Manchester.
In Birmingham, a large police contingent moved into the district of Winson Green, where the three young men were killed by the driver. A police spokesman said an investigation had indicated that the car had been driven ''deliberately'' at a group of about 80 young men who were protecting a gas station from looters.
Tariq Jahan, the father of the youngest of the three victims, described bloodying his hands in a failed bid to restore his son's breathing, then turned to an appeal for all in the community to renounce violence. ''Why? Why?'' he said.
Online Correction: August 11, 2011, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated when William J. Bratton was New York City's police commissioner. As correctly noted elsewhere in the article, he served in New York in the mid-1990s, not the mid-1980s.

HEADLINE: Starving in Somalia: Millions are at risk and require an immediate and generous international response

 BODY:
The worst famine in 60 years is devastating the Horn of Africa. In Somalia, where the problem is most acute, 3.9 million people are at risk of starvation and as many as 12 million throughout the region. Some 29,000 Somali children are believed to have died in the last 90 days alone. The casualties will only grow without an urgent and generous international response. 
The United Nations has made an emergency appeal for $2.4 billion but only received $1.1 billion in pledges. The United States has contributed $580 million so far and is the largest donor, as it should be. Other countries -- especially in Africa and in the gulf region -- also need to quickly help out. President Obama must urge them to do so.
East Africa is prone to famine, and drought has resulted in severe scarcities of food and water. The Obama administration deserves credit for acting in advance to ameliorate the effects. A warning system deployed by the United States Agency for International Development used satellite imagery and other techniques to predict the crisis last summer, according to American officials.
Since then, the agency has placed food and other supplies in Kenya, Djibouti and South Africa so they were available quickly when needed. It is also working on programs to help Somalia and other countries improve food production to avert future crises. Republicans in Congress must not be allowed to succeed in their mean-spirited and shortsighted efforts to slash food aid for next year.
Somalis are also victims of a country in chaos for 20 years. The Shabab, a ruthless extremist group linked to Al Qaeda, is battling a weak Western-backed government and until this week, blocked aid groups from delivering food to the starving. As The Times reported on Thursday, for the past decade, overall American strategy in Somalia has been troubled by a lack of focus and internal battles.
It is not in Washington's interest for Somalia to become a safe haven for militants who aim to target the West. But it is troubling that the United States has become increasingly dependent on private contractors to train African troops fighting the Shabab. A decision by the Central Intelligence Agency to train Somali commandos and intelligence operatives, which many say are becoming a power base independent of the government, seems especially counterproductive.
There is no easy answer to Somali's agonies. It has to start with saving millions now at risk of starvation, helping them improve their ability to grow their own food and finding ways to strengthen a shaky central government.

HEADLINE: Republicans Overlook Role in Credit Rating

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
11:13 p.m. Updated As they tried to blame President Obama for the nation's lowered credit rating, the Republican presidential candidates who squared off Thursday night in Iowa made several misleading, incomplete or simply false claims.
''I was fortunate enough to be a governor that got an increase in the credit rating of my state at the same time we got a president who got a decrease in the credit rating of our nation,'' Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, said. ''And that's because our president simply doesn't understand how to lead and how to grow an economy.'' 
And Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota repeated her assertion that ''we should not have increased the debt ceiling.''
''In the last two months, I was leading on the issue of not increasing the debt ceiling,'' she said. ''That turned out to be the right answer.''
The ratings agency that lowered the credit rating, Standard & Poor's, has carefully avoided partisan finger-pointing in its explanations of its downgrade. But some of the factors it cited - from the ''political brinksmanship'' that left the nation at the precipice of default to its concerns that the deficit-cutting deal ''falls short'' of what is needed - can be attributed to Republicans in Congress as much as, or even more than, President Obama.
The ratings agency lamented in its report on the downgrade that ''the statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy.''
It was Republicans in Congress who made it a bargaining chip. They balked at raising the nation's $14.3 trillion debt limit - which was needed to pay for spending that Congress had already approved - unless the White House agreed to a new package of spending cuts. The Obama administration initially sought a ''clean'' bill to raise the debt limit, saying that needed steps to reduce the deficit should not be linked to a bill that had to be passed so the nation could pay the bills it had already incurred.
The Republicans prevailed. When, after weeks of wrangling, a bill to reduce the deficit and raise the debt ceiling was finally passed this month, the nation was just hours away from a default that economists warned would have harmed the fragile economy.
Of course, President Obama acted similarly to Ms. Bachmann when he was in the Senate: he voted against raising the debt limit in 2006, a vote his aides say he regrets.
But prominent economists and business leaders have said a failure to raise the debt ceiling would have led to a default that would have hurt the economy. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, testified that it would likely be ''a recovery-ending event.'' Speaking this spring to the United States Chamber of Commerce about the possibility of default, Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, ''If anyone wants to push that button, which I think would be catastrophic and unpredictable, I think they're crazy.''
Several Republicans assailed President Obama for not cutting spending enough. S.& P. warned that the agreement, which is expected to cut the deficit by at least $2.1 trillion over the next decade, ''falls short of the amount that we believe is necessary.''
But President Obama pushed for a plan to cut the deficit by $4 trillion, with cuts to entitlement programs that are popular with Democrats - including Medicare and Medicaid - as well as some $1 trillion in new revenues. It was House Republicans who rejected it, opposing any tax increases and ultimately pushing for the smaller measure.
The Republican opposition to tax increases may have been a factor as well. S. & P. wrote that it takes no position on the mix of spending and revenue measures needed to shore up the nation's finances. But one factor it cited in its report was its belief that the Bush tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 - which are due to expire at the end of 2012 - would remain. ''We have changed our assumption on this because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues,'' it wrote.
And what about the balanced budget amendment Mr. Romney and most of the Republican presidential candidates called for? It may not have helped with the ratings agencies either.
John Chambers, the chairman of the sovereign rating committee at S. & P., was cool to the idea of a balanced budget amendment when he was asked about it last week on CNN. ''It would just reduce your flexibility in a crisis,'' he said in the interview.
Representative Bachmann misrepresented the debt ceiling debate when she complained that Congress had given a ''blank check'' to President Obama by agreeing to raise the debt ceiling - even though the debt ceiling had to be raised to pay for the bills that Congress had already approved, and not future spending.
And her gloss of the warning from the ratings agency was off as well. ''We just heard from Standard & Poor's,'' she said at one point. ''When they dropped our credit rating what they said was we don't have an ability to repay our debt.''
In fact, the ratings agency warned that the difficulty in reaching consensus was weakening the government's ability to manage its finances. And they were dismayed by how close the nation came to default - which would have happened if Ms. Bachmann's view, which was that the debt ceiling should not have been raised, had prevailed.
Ms. Bachmann also claimed that the deal only led to ''$21 billion in illusory cuts.'' While that was the amount projected for the very short term, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office found that the deal would cut the deficit by at least $2.1 trillion over the next decade.
Her complaint the cuts were illusory also clashed with her own critique of the debt ceiling deal from last week, when The Des Moines Register quoted he as saying: ''Under this debt-ceiling bill, do you know how this works? The first thing that gets whacked and with a hatchet is defense.''
Kitty Bennett contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Is Elected, But Bears Perry's Stamp

BYLINE: By BETH BROWN. 
bbrown@texastribune.org

 BODY:
In Texas, virtually all judges are elected. But since he took office in 2000, Gov. Rick Perry has picked most of the winners on the state's highest civil court, the Texas Supreme Court.
For example, in June 2010 Mr. Perry appointed Debra Lehrmann to fill out the term of Harriet O'Neill, who had stepped down. Last November, in her first general election, Ms. Lehrmann went on to handily win a six-year term
To date, only one of Mr. Perry's 10 Supreme Court appointees has lost a subsequent election to the court. In 2002, Xavier Rodriguez was defeated in the Republican primary, his first. Observers at the time attributed the loss to his Hispanic last name. 
Like his predecessors ''for generations,'' according to Judge Don Willett of the State Supreme Court, Mr. Perry has had the opportunity to appoint so many justices in part because of a financial disincentive for judges to remain on the bench once they are eligible to retire with full state benefits and a pension. Salaries in the private sector can be very alluring.
''The salary economics are pretty stark,'' Judge Willett said in an e-mail, adding, ''It's unfortunate when elected officials, judges included, exit before serving their full terms, but the math is unrelenting.''
Second, running as an incumbent, even a newly minted one, has advantages. Donors and lobbying groups are reluctant to go against a sitting justice, or one who has the governor's stamp of approval.
Whatever the cause, the result is a mostly Perry-appointed Supreme Court that Alex Winslow, the executive director of the liberal consumer advocacy group Texas Watch, said had upheld the governor's ''staunchly pro-defendant and anti-consumer'' ideals. (The state's highest court in criminal matters is the Court of Criminal Appeals.)
Mr. Winslow's organization analyzed the Supreme Court's decisions during the 2008-9 term and found that it sided with consumers in 27 percent of cases involving an individual against a corporation or government agency -- and it reversed jury verdicts in 72 percent of cases.
But Todd Olsen, a Republican consultant who runs judicial campaigns and is a former vice president of Karl Rove & Company, argues that studies trying to prove that the justices vote as a ''Perry block'' are problematic and do not account for all variables.
''I don't think there's anything clear there,'' Mr. Olsen said. ''It's really hard to do a study like that. There are judges who have all had lots of experience. That's the one thing that is in common among all of them.''
Judge Willett took over his predecessor's six-year term with 15 months remaining when Mr. Perry appointed him in 2005. He said the governor had chosen judges who reflected his judicial philosophy, which Judge Willett described as ''unabashedly conservative.'' Mr. Perry, he said, understands the importance of judicial appointments and would carry that understanding into the White House were he elected president.
''If you're president, it's often your court appointments that seal your legacy with a capital L,'' the judge said. ''I'm confident Governor Perry gets that, consummately.
''He doesn't do squishy. His judicial picks, from the Supreme Court on down, will not be philosophical ciphers, but impeccably credentialed conservative stalwarts who act judicially by adjudicating, not politically by legislating.''

HEADLINE: Fight Harder, Voters (of Both Parties) Back Home Are Telling Lawmakers

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Reporting was contributed by Robbie Brown from Georgia, Christina Capecci from Minnesota, Mark Guarino from Illinois and Martin Stolz from Utah.

 BODY:
VIRGINIA BEACH -- Taking in the highly unfavorable view most Americans have about Congress right now, it might be assumed that what voters seek is a lowered volume, thoughtful bipartisanship and legislative compromise. But in meetings with voters across the country this week, many members of Congress are seeing a mirror of the House floor.
As lawmakers meet with voters back home in their districts, the message is often not ''Can't we all just get along?'' but rather a push to get back into the ring and fight harder, as they face the most partisan and intransigent factions of both parties. 
In middle school auditoriums, retirement centers, recital halls and other such venues, angry constituents are deriding their representatives for the spectacle of the past month over the raising of the debt ceiling.
But in many cases, the anger is less about the dissension that brought the nation to the edge of default than frustration with both Democrats -- including President Obama -- and Republicans that their side had not been tough enough.
''I sometimes wonder,'' said John Joslin, 70, a Democrat reflecting on Mr. Obama during a town hall-style meeting on Tuesday with Representative Betty McCollum, Democrat of Minnesota, ''Whose side is he on? He's almost Republican. He's just rolled over and rolled over and rolled over, and I hope that you, as a progressive, can somehow add some steel to his blood.''
Preston Davis, 48, of Payson, lamented, ''Republicans chasing Democrats to the left, and I hate it when the party deserts me.''
So far, the post debt-debate gatherings have neither the urgency nor the toxicity of those from the summer of 2009, when angry voters and interest groups came out slugging over health care. But what members -- with their eyes turned both to the new committee charged with deficit reduction recommendations and the 2012 campaign -- are finding back home suggests that tough times lie ahead in Washington.
Representative Tom Graves, Republican of Georgia, told an audience of about 100 in Fort Oglethorpe this week that he did not vote for a final deal to increase the debt ceiling, because: ''I believe compromises are what got us into this mess in the first place. You can't compromise your way out of it.'' He was met with thunderous applause.
Town hall-style meetings are an imperfect arbiter of voter sentiment. While the meetings draw plenty of local constituents, they are also a magnet for activists, as Democrats and Republican have learned the importance of packing the halls with supporters.
But as the raucous meetings in the summer of 2009 demonstrated, the tone of the meetings tends to frame the terms of the debate.
It is a reality that Representative Eric Cantor, the majority leader, made note of in a call with his members this week.
''When we are out with constituents who are voicing anger frustration and fear,'' Mr. Cantor said, according to transcripts, ''in this economy, that's understandable. We need to try to listen and address their concerns and show that we have acted and have a handle on the situation. We are going to continue to take our case to Democrats and the president.''
Members can often test their crowd with particular lines or references to bills. At a meeting here in Virginia Beach on Tuesday night with several lawmakers invited by the district's Republican congressman, Scott Rigell, members spoke of a balanced budget amendment -- something many Republicans in Congress are seeking as part of any long-term deficit reduction deal -- which sent the audience to its feet.
In her meeting in St. Paul, Ms. McCollum tried to throw her audience some liberal red meat, even while preaching civility to those who heckled a man for advocating higher tax rates for high earners. ''Since the elections last fall,'' she said, ''the Republican Tea Party has forced our country into one manufactured crisis after another.''
While most members got broad support from those who attend their meetings -- and are not there simply to protest -- others saw significant push back. ''What we're going through right now doesn't bother me,'' said Representative Joe Walsh of Illinois, as he addressed 50 people in DeKalb on Wednesday night. The audience snorted in mocking laughter.
Mr. Walsh, who has been an outspoken critic of the debt ceiling deal and who is under fire after The Chicago Sun-Times reported that he owed thousands of dollars in child support, continued: ''I think this is good for this country because the country has finally woken up and is finally going to get serious about big problems. It's like it's asleep 40, 50 years and woke up and 'My God, the government has all these problems.' I think all this wrestling right now is good. I think we're finally taking them serious.''
(Concerning his child-support debts, Mr. Walsh said: ''We're trying to get this taken care of legally. I can't and won't talk about this publicly. This is a personal matter near and dear to me, it involves me, it involves my kids, it involves my family. I'm not going to publicly talk about that.'')
There is clear evidence that some liberal groups are stoking the partisan fires at meetings. A group called the American Dream Movement has been protesting outside Republican meetings -- a small group formed here Tuesday night, and handed out buttons -- and other groups have also sent protesters or hostile questioners to meetings.
But the importance of adhering to ideological orthodoxy within the legislative process is often reinforced by members when they have a supportive crowd. First elected to the House in 2008, Mr. Chaffetz then defeated a six-term Republican incumbent, former Representative Chris Cannon.
''If you want different results, you have to elect different people,'' Mr. Chaffetz told his audience in American Fork. Noting that in the 2008 campaign, fellow Republicans campaigned against him, he said with glee: ''I love that; bring it on.''
Wild applause.

HEADLINE: British Police Are Assailed by Politicians and Protesters, for Different Reasons

BYLINE: By RAVI SOMAIYA and ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- Britain's latest convulsion of rioting and looting began with a protest against the police handling of a killing in north London, but it soon turned into something much bigger -- a challenge to state authority that shook the political elite, and, for the police itself, one more bleak entry in a catalog of crisis and condemnation.
In Parliament, recalled from recess on Thursday, a chorus of lawmakers denounced the police response to the riots as incompetent. One said that officers were instructed to ''stand and observe looting.'' Prime Minister David Cameron said he would look to an American expert for help -- William J. Bratton, who helped reduce crime levels in New York City in the 1990s.
Ever since the murder of a black teenager in 1993, the British police -- who once held an affectionate place in life here -- have been embroiled in contentious episodes ranging from the mistaken shooting by plainclothes officers of a Brazilian electrician, Jean Charles de Menezes, in the aftermath of the July 7 London subway and bus bombings in 2005, to the death of a newspaper vendor manhandled by police at a protest against globalization in 2009. 
Only weeks ago, London's Metropolitan Police, widely known as Scotland Yard, faced public questioning over a failure to fully investigate a phone hacking scandal that led to the resignation of its two most senior officers.
Now, with images of officers standing by as parts of London burned, seemingly outwitted and outmaneuvered by masked and hooded marauders, the police are condemned by some rioters as a cause of their rage, and are the butt of public outrage at the failure to prevent the violence from spreading.
''There were simply far too few police deployed on to our streets,'' Mr. Cameron said of the initial days of the riots this week, ''and the tactics they were using weren't working.''
As Theresa May, the cabinet minister responsible for policing, told Parliament, ''Policing by consent is the British way, but the police only retain the confidence of the wider community if they are seen to take clear and robust action in the face of open criminality.'' She added later that often ''officers are damned if they do and damned if they don't,'' in cracking down on protests and riots.
The broader question, though, is this: How did a national institution once held in esteem, or at least respect, by many Britons -- ''bobbies on the beat'' to an earlier generation -- become a force of such contention, even as, in recent years, it has taken credit for shielding the country from an array of terrorist plots?
With their tall, rounded helmets, British police officers have traditionally avoided shows of strength in favor of community policing. Most British officers still do not carry guns.
Yet, in recent years the force, overwhelmingly white, has faced accusations of racism, brutality and incompetence that it has struggled to shake off.
The story of the change in their place is one of incremental missteps as the nature of society itself has changed. Britain has become more diverse and complex in an era when the smash-and-grab crime of earlier decades has been replaced by far more sophisticated law-breaking. And at the same time, the point of contact between the police and the people has been increasingly shaded with questions of race and resentment.
During the latest riots, the most violent in memory, officers were overrun by nimble, well-connected rioters using bicycles, mopeds, smartphones and social networking to organize violence and theft across the capital. At several of the riots, young men could be seen whizzing away from slowly massing riot police officers, only to gather elsewhere.
Across London, as people surveyed the wreckage of their homes and businesses, many complained that the police had done too little. On Wednesday Mr. Cameron announced new plans that would allow the British police to deploy water cannons and plastic bullets against any new violence. The Associated Press reported that facial recognition software would be used to identify looters and rioters captured on CCTV and other cameras. And Mr. Cameron added Thursday that he wanted to discuss going ''further in getting to grips with gangs with people like Bill Bratton, former commissioner of police in New York and Los Angeles.''
A former senior riot police officer with knowledge of current operations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the most recent riots were allowed to rage, in part, because police officers felt constrained. They operated, the former officer said, in the shadow of the case of a newspaper vendor, Ian Tomlinson, who died after being shoved by a riot officer guarding against protesters at a Group of 20 economic conference in 2009. The police officer, Simon Harwood, will go on trial for manslaughter in October.
Riot police officers in the elite Territorial Support Group, who wear distinctive boiler suits and have been present at most of the unrest, ''know they've got to be very careful,'' the former officer said. ''Everyone is filming everyone, and you don't want to be locked up.'' Water cannons and plastic bullets, the former officer said, are ''more for P.R. among politicians,'' and probably would not be effective against the fast-moving rioters who outran the police. A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police quoted the acting head of the force, Tim Godwin, and said, ''We police by consent, that's the situation that's always been and it will continue that way.''
Jules Carey, a solicitor for the Ian Tomlinson Family Campaign, which pushed for a prosecution in his death, said by e-mail that the police should restore order ''using lawful and proportionate force.''
Others suggested that more aggressive policing to control riots would lead only to further problems. ''The ones who are going to get beaten up,'' said Rob Berkeley, director of Runnymede Trust, a research organization that focuses on racial equality, ''are young people from minority communities.''
Despite some efforts to hire more diverse officers, many people still feel they are ''underprotected and oversurveyed,'' Mr. Berkeley said, with extensive police stop-and-search powers a particular area of tension. ''If you police by consent, trust is crucial,'' Mr. Berkeley said. ''And these communities don't trust the police to protect them, or to treat them fairly.''
Metropolitan Police figures from May 2011, the most recent available, show that three times as many black and Asian people were stopped and searched in London as all other ethnicities combined, even though they make up only a quarter of the city's population. The Metropolitan Police spokesman said that officers operated within national guidelines on stop and search, and that they had to have a suspicion of crime before conducting such searches. He said that 9.6 percent of officers were now black or minority ethnic, and that the police remained ''committed to having a diverse work force.''
But at the riots in Tottenham and Hackney in recent days, several rioters cited a hatred of the police, and their perceived racism, as motivating the violence. One young man in Hackney shouted at the officers: ''You know you all racist! You know it.''

HEADLINE: 8 From G.O.P. Let Sparks Fly At Iowa Debate

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
AMES, Iowa -- A withering critique of President Obama's handling of the economy was overshadowed by a burst of incivility among the Republican presidential candidates who gathered here for a debate on Thursday night and fought to stay alive in the party's increasingly fractious nominating race.
The simmering animosity that has been building among some contenders broke into full view during the two-hour debate, with Representative Michele Bachmann defending her legislative accomplishments, her economic ideas and her experience to serve as president. She batted away the criticism, smiling at times and swinging at others, trying to prove she could take the heat. 
While the first votes of the Republican nominating contest are six months away, a sense of urgency already hangs over the campaign. Several candidates face a far earlier test and are struggling to avoid being embarrassed at the Iowa straw poll on Saturday -- the same day Gov. Rick Perry of Texas intends to declare his candidacy and join the Republican race.
Tim Pawlenty, a former Minnesota governor who is seeking to rejuvenate his campaign, repeatedly assailed Mrs. Bachmann's record. He stood directly at her side and accused her of ''making false statements'' and having ''a record of misstatements.''
''The American people are going to expect more and demand more,'' he said. His criticism was so stinging, quiet jeers could be heard in the crowd. He added: ''If that's your view of effective leadership with results, please stop, because you're killing us.''
As the rest of the field looked on, Mrs. Bachmann shot back that Mr. Pawlenty pursued policies as Minnesota governor that sound ''a lot more like Barack Obama, if you ask me.'' She cited his support for cap-and-trade environmental policies and for individual health care mandates.
The debate, which took place in Stephens Auditorium on the campus of Iowa State University, came at a moment of increasing intensity in the Republican campaign.
While the eight candidates were united in their criticism of Mr. Obama, with a particular focus on his economic policies and unemployment, the crosscurrents in Iowa overshadowed the larger issues in the race.
Mitt Romney, who was positioned at the center of the stage, sought to stay above the fray as he stood silently and watched the Minnesota politicians engage in their unusually sharp back and forth. He brushed aside a suggestion that he had not played a leading role in the debate over raising the nation's debt ceiling.
''I'm not president now,'' he said with a smile, ''though I would have liked to have been.''
Mr. Romney, who has raised more money and built a stronger organization than any other candidate, seemed to relish in steering clear of the fight. He defended his health care record as governor of Massachusetts and often resorted to humor.
When Mr. Pawlenty served up a gentle dig at Mr. Romney's wealth, offering to mow just one acre of Mr. Romney's estate, Mr. Romney laughed it off, saying, ''That's just fine.'' Later, when in a contrast to his previous debate performance, Mr. Pawlenty attacked Mr. Romney for his health care plan and compared it to the president's plan, Mr. Romney simply joked, ''I think I like Tim's answer at the last debate better.''
Mr. Romney was more willing to take on Mr. Obama. When asked if he would have vetoed the debt ceiling bill, Mr. Romney made clear that he disagreed with the final compromise with Congress.
''Look, I'm not going to eat Barack Obama's dog food, all right?'' he said. ''What he served up was not what I would have done if I'd had been president of the United States.''
Bret Baier, a Fox News anchor who served as the moderator, opened the debate by reciting a list of the challenges facing the country, from the downgrade in the nation's credit rating, to the fall of financial markets, to the helicopter crash in Afghanistan that killed 30 American troops. He urged a civil conversation.
But the debate's proximity to Saturday's straw poll, a sink-or-swim moment for several candidates, led to the biggest display yet of combativeness among candidates who often evoke Ronald Reagan, but did not heed his 11th commandment, not to speak ill of fellow Republicans.
As Mr. Pawlenty tore after Mrs. Bachmann, Newt Gingrich went after the news media. Representative Ron Paul of Texas joined in the fight, taking exception to Mrs. Bachmann's legislative record. Herman Cain, a businessman who has drawn large crowds in Iowa, dismissed all of his rivals as career politicians.
At one point, Rick Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator, raised his hand for attention and asked moderators to be included. When he finally was given his turn, he went after nearly all of his rivals, accusing Mrs. Bachmann of ''showmanship, not leadership'' by opposing raising the nation's debt ceiling.
In the middle of it all, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., a former Utah governor making his debut on the debate stage, struggled to be heard. Again and again, he urged his rivals to focus on creating jobs.
''President Obama has had two and a half years to get it right,'' said Mr. Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China in the Obama administration. ''He's fundamentally failed us.''
Even as the Republicans debated here, Sarah Palin, who has yet to rule out a presidential bid, arrived in Iowa and planned to visit the fair on Friday. Her visit was being carefully watched for signals of her intentions.
Mrs. Bachmann was the only candidate asked directly about Ms. Palin. ''I like Sarah Palin a lot,'' she said when the moderator wondered if Ms. Palin was stealing her thunder. ''We are very good friends.''
Other than a brief moment at the beginning of the second hour, when the debate returned from commercial break and Mrs. Bachmann was nowhere to be found, striding to her lectern just moments later, the Minnesota congresswoman kept her cool.
When Byron York, a conservative columnist at The Washington Examiner who was on the panel of questioners, asked Mrs. Bachmann about her vow to be submissive to her husband, Marcus, the audience gasped and then booed. She smiled, paused and replied, ''Thank you for that question, Byron.''
''What submission means to us, if that's what your question is,'' she added, ''it means respect.''

HEADLINE: Another View: A Path to Fiscal Responsibility

BYLINE: HERALD L. RITCH


HIGHLIGHT: Herald L. Ritch, chief executive of Sagent Advisors, proposes a framework for getting the nation's finances in order.

 BODY:
As Standard & Poor's downgrade of the United States government's debt shows, our long-term federal fiscal woes remain with us. Rather than playing the near-default or the downgrade blame games, we in the business community should demand that Congress and the Obama administration adopt a program to move the country forward in a fiscally responsible manner. Here is one possible framework for developing such a path. 
As in business, our key political leaders and policy makers need to make a long-term assessment of our likely revenues and critical spending needs, all in a holistic and pro-growth manner that values the creation of private-sector jobs, while recognizing the financial straitjacket in which we find ourselves.
While belt-tightening is now a clear necessity, cutting expenditures needs to be done responsibly. Every proposed dollar to be spent in the federal budget is not equally vital in providing a social safety net for the American people, infrastructure and government services necessary to foster American economic growth or our defense. To suggest government spending cannot be limited is faulty logic.
A corollary to this notion is that across-the-board cuts may be an "easy" way to implement cutbacks, but such an approach is, at best, a suboptimal solution.
But first things first. We need to carefully think about revenues. At a minimum, some sort of grand bargain on taxation along the lines of the Bowles-Simpson Commission's recommendations should be possible in which tax rates on corporations and individuals are lowered in exchange for the elimination of loopholes and deductions. Business leaders should encourage politicians to begin a rational fiscal dialogue with a Bowles-Simpson type compromise. The objectives would be short-term revenue neutrality using static analysis, but longer-term economic growth using behavioral analysis. If judiciously constructed, most Americans would support it.
Beyond that, further discussion of tax increases has to be tabled until later in this national debate. We have to acknowledge that too many of our citizens have, for good reason, lost faith in Washington's ability to spend their money wisely. By first having a substantive and transparent debate on our true critical spending requirements, any increased revenue proposals would be put in proper context for politicians and policy makers to make constructive choices.
Next, a 10-year assessment of vital spending needs should be addressed. Everything must be on the table in this exercise, like any business budget in crisis. Think zero-base budgeting as a general construct. Each major spending issue needs to be addressed with the knowledge that we now face serious budgetary constraints while we balance today's other relevant realities. More important, clinging to the mantra of "no cuts in entitlements" is not constructive in the context of the overall fiscal vise in which we find ourselves, as these programs' true economic - as opposed to budgetary - deficits are projected to run into tens of trillions of dollars.
To foster a realistic assessment of the true cost of our entitlement programs, the federal government should be required to use accrual accounting as businesses are required to do under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, so that our budgetary projections are both more reflective of the economic enormity of the entitlement funding problem and transparent for our citizens. 
In my proposed exercise on spending, our politicians and other policy makers need to focus solely on the country's imperative needs. The questions should be: "What is absolutely essential for our citizens' health care and other social welfare needs? For a pro-growth, job-creating economy? For maintaining our country's defense?" The federal budget must be built from the ground up, brick-by-brick every year, and not just increased X percent across the board by line item from last year. Difficult judgments about cost-benefit analyses and trade-offs have to be made.
In this time of great economic challenge, the "wouldn't it be nice items" that have consistently found their way into the federal budget over the years must be jettisoned not only because of their costs but also because of the message that such projects send to the populace.
Once revenues and projected expenditures have been addressed as outlined here, if there is a funding shortfall, it will need to be thoughtfully addressed. Hopefully, reasoned arguments, not political posturing of "no taxes" or "more revenues," will be proffered by proponents as to why additional revenues are necessary and how they can be achieved, and serious and fact-based debate could ensue.
Now is clearly the time to undertake a holistic budgeting exercise and a comprehensive public discussion of federal finances without the political rancor that we have recently been subjected to by all sides of the political spectrum. If President Obama, Congress and relevant policy makers fail us once more, the continuing economic crisis will cause the country to go into an even deeper economic morass from which it may not be extricated for many years to come. Other governments have been able to reach across their political divides and deal effectively with similar issues. There is no reason why the American annual and longer-term budgetary issues cannot be similarly addressed head-on by our political leaders.
Likewise, the business community cannot sit idly by or support positions that curtail a serious dialogue on the issues in the belief that it is acting in its interests. If our political and business leaders continue to pursue the current course, the country will be greatly diminished.

HEADLINE: For Wall Street, T.G.I.F.?

BYLINE: DEALBOOK


HIGHLIGHT: After a wild week, stock markets around the world appear to have calmed down. In the United States, stock futures are pointing to a lower opening.

 BODY:
A wild and at times frightening week in the global stock markets -- evoking the dark days of the 2008 financial crisis for some -- appears to be drawing to a close on a much calmer note. 
United States stock index futures fluctuated early Friday and were pointing to a slightly lower opening less than three hours before the start of trading. 
European stock markets were higher, with London up 1.3 percent and Frankfurt up 1.7 percent. Yields on Italian 10-year notes were higher for the sixth consecutive day. 
The new temporary ban on short sales in four European countries -- France, Italy, Spain and Belgium -- may have had an impact. Shares of French banks Societe Generale and BNP Paribas, battered this week by liquidity fears, were higher in midday trading in Paris. 
Asian markets were relatively little changed. Tokyo ended down 0.20 percent, while Hong Kong was up 0.13 percent. 
Here is a round-up of some financial headlines on Friday: 
New York Times: 5 European Nations to Curtail Short-Selling
FT Alphaville: Insiders Buying at Fastest Pace Since 2008
Bloomberg News: High-Frequency Trades Tripled During Plunge
Financial Times: S.E.C. Looking Into S.&P. Downgrade Disclosures

HIGHLIGHT: After a wild week, stock markets around the world appear to have calmed down. In the United States, stock futures are pointing to a flat opening.

 BODY:
A wild and at times frightening week in the global stock markets -- evoking the dark days of the 2008 financial crisis for some -- appears to be drawing to a close on a much calmer note. 
United States stock index futures fluctuated early Friday and were pointing to a slightly lower opening less than three hours before the start of trading. 
 European stock markets were higher, with London up 1.3 percent and Frankfurt up 1.7 percent. Yields on Italian 10-year notes were higher for the sixth consecutive day. 
The new temporary ban on short sales in four European countries -- France, Italy, Spain and Belgium -- may have had an impact. Shares of French banks Societe Generale and BNP Paribas, battered this week by rumors and fears over liquidity, were higher in midday trading in Paris. 
Asian markets were relatively little changed. Tokyo ended down 0.20 percent, while Hong Kong was up 0.13 percent. 
Here is a round-up of some financial headlines on Friday: 
New York Times: 5 European Nations to Curtail Short-Selling
FT Alphaville: Insiders Buying at Fastest Pace Since 2008
Bloomberg News: High-Frequency Trades Tripled During Plunge

HEADLINE: Facing Complaints, S.E.C. Opens Whistle-Blower Office

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The new program will issue cash rewards to employees who report fraud to the government, an effort by the S.E.C. to expose corporate crime in the aftermath of the financial crisis.

 BODY:
Get your whistles out, corporate employees. 
The Securities and Exchange Commission's whistle-blower office opened its doors on Friday, much to the delight of plaintiffs' lawyers and the consternation of Corporate America. 
The new program will issue cash rewards to employees who report fraud to the government, an effort by the S.E.C. to expose corporate crime in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The S.E.C., hammered by critics for ignoring tips about Bernard L. Madoff's huge Ponzi scheme and other corporate malfeasance before the crisis, is gearing up to spend top dollar for first-class tips. 
Under the program, corporate tipsters could reap as much as 30 percent of the funds the S.E.C. collects from a company or its executives. To qualify for the reward, an employee must turn over new information that ultimately prompts successful enforcement actions yielding more than $1 million in fines. The agency will tap the $450 million Investor Protection Fund to dole out awards. 
Still, the S.E.C. says the whistle-blower program will actually save money in the long run, as tipsters offer guidance to a strapped staff of agency lawyers and investigators. 
The program "will strengthen our ability to carry our mission and it will save us much time and resources in the process," Sean McKessy, chief of the S.E.C.'s whistle-blower office, said in a speech on Thursday at Georgetown University's McDonough School of Business. 
The agency, Mr. McKessy said, has already received an uptick in quality tips, including lengthy letters laying our elaborate schemes. On Day One, the office has seven employees to review the claims and a revamped Web site
 to collect them. 
The program is the product of the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law, which mandated an overhaul of the S.E.C.'s whistle-blower provisions. Until now, the agency limited its whistle-blower program to insider trading cases, and capped awards at 10 percent of the penalties.
Once the S.E.C. adopted the changes in May, Mr. McKessy launched a charm campaign to tame some fierce opposition from corporations and their lawyers. He joined some 10 panel discussions and Webinars about the topic and huddled with various lawyers, ultimately reaching more than 1,000 people, he said. 
And yet, Mr. McKessy said, "there exists still some misunderstanding about the hotly contested issues."
 Corporate lawyers and lobbyists have compared Mr. McKessy's office to a bounty program, saying it will generate bogus tips while producing a windfall for plaintiff's lawyers who represent scorned employees. 
When the S.E.C. first announced plans for the office in November, it sparked a contentious six-month lobbying campaign by corporate interests. The agency received a flood of more than 200 comments and 1,300 forms letters about the program from a cross-section of Wall Street firms and corporate America - from JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup to General Electric and Google. Some of the loudest complaints came from the United States Chamber of Commerce, which alone sent four comment letters and held at least three discussions with S.E.C. officials.
When a divided S.E.C. approved the whistle-blower program in a 3-2 vote in May, the Chamber lashed out at the agency. 
"In approving this new whistle-blower rule, the S.E.C. has chosen to put trial lawyer profits ahead of effective compliance and corporate governance," David Hirschmann, president and C.E.O. of the Chamber's Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness, said at the time. "This rule will make it harder and slower to detect and stop corporate fraud."
The chamber's concerns centered on the most controversial aspect of the program, which allows whistle-blowers to expose fraud without first sounding the alarms at their company. The program, the chamber argues, will undermine internal compliance departments that corporations were forced to bolster under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.
Mr. McKessy, who previously served as corporate secretary for both AOL and the Altria Group, which owns tobacco giant Phillip Morris, disputed the industry's alarmist claims. By not mandating internal reporting, he said, the program will enable employees to report fraud, even when their bosses are involved in the scheme.
He also noted that the agency tweaked it original whistle-blower proposal to address some industry concerns. Under the final rules governing the program, the S.E.C is allowed to dish out heftier awards to employees who first report securities violations to corporate compliance departments.
In a December letter to the S.E.C., the Financial Services Roundtable asked the agency to do just that, urging that reporting internally "must be a specific factor in determining the amount of any award." The language appeared nearly word-for-word in the S.E.C.'s description of the final regulation, which said working with internal-compliance departments was "a factor that can increase the amount of an award."
The program also allows tipsters to collect their bounty even when they first reported wrongdoing to the company's compliance department, so long as the employee shares the same information with authorities within 120 days. 
"The whistle-blower program will bolster, not hamper, internal compliance departments," Mr. McKessy said.

HEADLINE: Do Congress and the White House Deserve an AA+ Rating?

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The American style of governance has been to provide a growing array of services and financial transfers and underwriting them with deferred taxes, a model that is unsustainable, an economist writes.

 BODY:
There now appears to be general agreement that the downgrade issued a week ago by Standard & Poor's on the "Political Risks and Rising Debt Burden" of long-term United States debt was not a statement on the probability of default on Treasury bonds at all. Instead, it appears to have been intended as a reminder that something has gone seriously wrong with the style of governance put in place by the Founding Fathers. 
Whether the current style of federal governance deserves the second highest grade S.&P. assigns (AA+) can, of course, be debated. I would be more inclined toward a plain B rating, that is, the governance equivalent of a junk bond.
Be that as it may, one manifestation of the decay in the federal style of governance has been the discovery that American voters can be pleased by providing them with a growing array of government services and financial transfers and by underwriting these with deferred taxes -- that is, current deficits. The deferred taxes are to be paid off by generations not yet born or still too young to vote. 
In the words of Doug Elmendorf, current director of the Congressional Budget Office, in a presentation last year, "The United States faces a fundamental disconnect between the services that people expect the government to provide, particularly the benefits for older Americans, and the tax revenues that people are willing to send to the government to finance those services."

To make politicians comfortable with this approach to governance, a theory was needed that "deficits don't matter." That theory reportedly was proposed by Vice President Dick Cheney to Paul O'Neill, then Treasury secretary, who in late 2002 had protested the Bush administration's evident addiction to debt. A fascinating account of the debate surrounding this proposition can be found in Jonathan Weisman's "Reagan Policies Gave Green Light to Red Ink" in The Washington Post, written in 2004. 
The economics profession did not entirely endorse Mr. Cheney's theory; neither, however, did it line up against it. Instead, as usual, it had a nice intra-professional, two-handed debate on the issue, accompanied by learned papers. Then, as now, the pronouncements of macroeconomists add up to confusion.
The footprints of this new style of federal governance can be seen in the following chart, which is featured in updated form year after year in the Congressional Budget Office's well-written long-term budget outlook.
It is instructive to reflect on this chart, along with the two charts shown below. The data for those charts can be found in Table B-79 of the Economic Report of the President, February 2011.
The first shows the gross federal debt as a percentage of gross domestic product from 1976 to 2011. It is the most inclusive measure of the Treasury's obligations, which ultimately are, of course, the obligations of the American taxpayer. The colors of the bars indicate presidential terms.
The gross federal debt includes debt owed to other government accounts -- for example, the Social Security Trust Fund, the Medicare Trust Fund and other retirement or government trust funds. Cash surpluses accumulated in these funds are invested in Treasury securities. 
Of the total gross federal debt of $13.6 trillion in 2010, $4.6 trillion was owed by the Treasury to these government trust funds and only $9 trillion to the public, which included international investors (47 percent), domestic private investors (36 percent), the Federal Reserve (9 percent) and state and local governments (8 percent). 
The next chart shows how the fraction of publicly held debt as a percentage of total gross federal debt has fluctuated over time. Note again that purchases by the Federal Reserve of Treasury debt, of which there have been many in the past few years, are counted as debt held by the public rather than intra-governmental debt.
Readers of this blog will draw their own inferences from these three charts. My own is that recklessness in United States fiscal policy is not a recent phenomenon, especially if one considers the devastating effect that the recession, starting in 2007-8, has had on federal tax revenues, now at a historical low as a percent of G.D.P., and on federal spending, now at a historical high. In fact, the federal deficit for 2009 had been projected by the Congressional Budget Office at $1.2 trillion even before the current administration moved into the White House.
The problem is much less the current budget deficits, which can be explained by the current recession, but that budget balance does not seem to be in sight long after the recession, we hope, is over. 
It is that problem that the White House and the Congress must solve. We must hope that care for the nation's future -- evidently now taking a holiday -- will return someday soon to their minds and souls. Perhaps then they will merit an AA+ rating.

 BODY:
After a week of wild swings, stock markets ended with relatively mild moves for the week, proving there was no need to come home from vacation just because there was a little volatility.
Here are the weekly changes for leading indexes in the United States and the largest countries in Europe and Asia, ranked by price change in local currencies:
1. Britain, FTSE 100: +1.4%
2. Spain, IBEX: -0.3%
3. Italy, FTSE/MIB: -0.8%
4. China, CSI 300: -0.8%
5. United States, S.&P. 500: -1.7%
6. France, CAC: -2.0%
7. India, Sensex: -2.7%
8. Japan, Nikkei 225: -3.6%
9. Germany, DAX: -3.8%
Permit me a few observations:
1. The only stock market that rose was the one in the country shaken by riots. Could investors be encouraged by the fact there will now be more investment (in rebuilding stores) and more spending (to restock looted inventories)? 
2. The worst performer was the country whose credit has been above reproach. Could bad credit be an advantage? Maybe in this era having a good balance sheet simply adds to the risks that a country will be asked to bail out somebody else. By that logic, the United States should be grateful to Standard & Poor's for the downgrade.
3. Worries about impending disaster in recent weeks have focused on Europe and the United States, while ignoring Asia. But Asian markets as a group underperformed. Could this be a signal that the real problems lie where we are not looking? Or could it indicate that having problems is a good thing in the view of investors? Note that stocks in Spain and Italy did better than those in France and Germany.
If much of the above strikes you as ridiculous, keep that in mind the next time you read an article that confidently uses the newest economic or political developments to explain the newest market moves. If there is one thing I have learned in nearly 30 years of trying to analyze markets, it is that the answers are rarely neat and simple, and that sometimes correlations prove absolutely nothing.

HEADLINE: Film on Climate Refugees Strikes a Chord

BYLINE: DOROTHY SPEARS


HIGHLIGHT: By focusing on the consequences of climate change rather than its scientific causes, some experts suggest that a filmmaker circumvented a divisive debate over global warming and the extent to which human activity contributes to it.

 BODY:
During the shooting of his 2010 documentary "Climate Refugees," the Irish-American filmmaker Michael Nash visited nearly 50 countries in about 18 months, interviewing politicians, scientists, health workers and victims of floods, cyclones, hurricanes and droughts. 
His conclusion was that short- and longer-term changes in climate are causing vast numbers of people to abandon their jobs, homes and countries to seek better lives elsewhere, or to simply survive. (Jeffrey Gettleman's recent coverage of the Somali refugee crisis in The Times has offered some vivid and disturbing examples, although Somalia's troubles are also inextricably linked to political turmoil.)
Mr. Nash poses a basic question: what will become of the millions of people whose lack of access to food and clean water leads them to take increasingly desperate measures? What type of strains will huge migration put on resources in more developed countries? 
Will this dislocation eventually, as the retired Navy vice admiral Lee Gunn told Mr. Nash, pose a threat to Americans' national security, too?

By focusing on the consequences of climate change rather than its scientific causes, some experts suggest that Mr. Nash succeeded in circumventing a divisive political debate over global warming and the extent to which human activity contributes to it.
 "Whether it's man or nature causing the climate to change, we still have to deal with islands going under water and people running out of food," Mr. Nash said in a telephone interview.
Daniel Shepard, an information officer at the United Nations who specializes in sustainable development, said of the film, "All of this green stuff is as economic and social as it is environmental -- and the movie does a good job of showing that."
Mr. Nash's approach has clearly resonated. Screenings of "Climate Refugees" are booked through next year at universities across the country, the filmmaker said. Typically, the screenings are accompanied by a question-and-answer period led by university professors from a range of fields including anthropology, environmental law, environmental science, global economics and, at the University of Texas at Austin recently, national security.
"Climate Refugees" has also been making the rounds at Green Building Council chapters around the country, Mr. Nash noted. And it continues to be screened at embassies abroad, with stops planned the next three weeks in Belgium, Russia and Switzerland.
Among the film's more striking moments are an opening sequence in which an elegiac view of Earth from space cuts to satellite images of Hurricane Katrina and fires in Southern California that are as spectacular as they are unnerving.
There are interviews that some find deeply moving, like one with a woman from Bangladesh who lost her baby daughter in a sudden storm, or another with a rice farmer in China who searched for his daughter after a flood but only found the remnants of her house.
A few critics have accused Mr. Nash of overstepping, however. A shot of frolicking children in the vulnerable Tuvalu Islands archipelago in the South Pacific, for example, is followed by the voice-over, "These people are going to go under water." 
The figures relating to environmentally induced migration are also debated, according to a report compiled by the United Nations University's Institute for Environment and Human Security in Bonn.
"Until now, there is no widely agreed upon and measurable definition of human mobility linked to environmental change," the report says.
The estimates vary from year to year. In 2005, for example, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees estimated that over 24 million people around the world fled their homes (some temporarily) because of extreme events like floods and drought and other environmental disasters, according to the report.
In 2010, the Norwegian Refugee Council's Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Center estimated that more than 42 million people "were forced to flee due to disasters triggered by sudden-onset natural hazards," the United Nations report said. In 2009, 17 million people were displaced by such disasters, it said, and in 2008, 36 million.
Definitions of what constitutes or can be attributed climate change are changing, as is the definition of environmentally-induced migration. But the report cautioned against "overconcern" about the numbers, which it said could overshadow the need to help policy makers address the problem.
What is more, the United Nations contests the use of the term "climate refugees" or "environmental refugees."
"The term of environmental refugee is not correct in legal terms," the report said. "In order to avoid any kind of misleading wording, we use the term of environmental migrants."
That said, a recent Friday screening of the film at the TriBeCa Grand Hotel in Manhattan sponsored by the United Nations Association, was followed by a lively endorsement by Mr. Shepard of the United Nations.
"I think this movie actually did a very good job in going around the world and showing how people are grappling with the social economic and environmental effects of climate change already," he said.
Mr. Shepard said the film's effort to frame the issue "in an optimistic way" also interested him. "I am also optimistic," he said.
In an e-mail, Koko Warner, an official at the United Nations University Institute for Environment and Human Security, said he particularly liked the film's collection of stories from ordinary people. The documentary "reaches out to a popular audience --especially in the U.S. -- and tells a story of the human face of climate change," Dr. Warner said. 
But "the story doest stop there," she said. "Nash interviews prominent leaders from the U.S. and other countries to point out that solutions -- particularly in energy transformations --are possible and within our reach."

HEADLINE: Low-Profile Candidate Hires High-Powered Fund-Raiser

BYLINE: DAVID W. CHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Tom Allon, a little-known candidate for mayor, has hired a potent fund-raiser, Cynthia R. Darrison, to help elevate his campaign.

 BODY:
Among the likely candidates for mayor in 2013, Tom Allon is a decided long shot, given that in a field likely to be crowded with familiar names, most New York voters probably have no idea who Mr. Allon is.
But he is hoping to gain some traction by hiring one of the city's biggest Democratic fund-raisers.
Mr. Allon, a publisher of community newspapers, has hired Cynthia R. Darrison, who helped to power the fund-raising machines of Andrew M. Cuomo in 2010 and Eliot Spitzer in 2006.
Ms. Darrison, the chief executive of Darrison Barrett & Associates, which has offices in Manhattan and, soon, Nashville, Tenn., has raised more than $100 million for Democratic candidates and committees since 1989. In 2009, she helped Cyrus R. Vance Jr. become the Manhattan district attorney and helped Bill de Blasio become the public advocate. That year she was also part of William C. Thompson Jr.'s failed bid to unseat Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. 
Ms. Darrison said in an interview that she had not planned to participate in the 2013 mayoral election. But one of her longtime corporate clients has been Mr. Allon's Manhattan Media company, which owns community newspapers including The New York Press and City Hall. And when Mr. Allon began talking about running for mayor as a pragmatic non-ideologue, emphasizing education reform, job creation and economic development, she found his pitch so appealing that she dropped him as a corporate client and took him on as a political one.
"I found in our discussions that I like his ideas for New York City," she said. "Education is crucial in terms of the future of this city and Tom understands, from both his education and business experience, how it all fits in."
Ms. Darrison said that the Allon campaign had already set up about 50 house parties and fund-rais-ers for the fall, in hopes of raising the $500,000 to $1 million by January that the campaign believes would demonstrate to the political establishment that Mr. Allon is a viable candidate, and not an also-ran. People in the business, real estate and education community have been especially interested, she said.
Of course, Mr. Allon has a difficult challenge trying to join a group of possible mayoral rivals who have been on the public stage for years: Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker; Mr. de Blasio; Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president; and John C. Liu, the city comptroller. Mr. Allon must also overcome a deep-rooted sense of Bloomberg fatigue, or even anger, among rabid Democratic primary voters. After all, he has long been an avid supporter of the mayor, and the Bloomberg campaign placed $2 million worth of ads in Mr. Allon's newspapers in 2009.

HEADLINE: Long Story Shortlist: Topsy Turvy Markets

BYLINE: THE STAFF


HIGHLIGHT: We looked into our archives for long stories on what's on everyone's mind: the markets.

 BODY:
"Can Europe be Saved?"
by Paul Krugman (Jan. 12, 2011)
There's something peculiarly apt about the fact that the current European crisis began in Greece. For Europe's woes have all the aspects of a classical Greek tragedy, in which a man of noble character is undone by the fatal flaw of hubris. Read more 
"Heading Off the Next Financial Crisis,"
by David Leonhardt (March 25, 2010)
A public good is something that the free market tends not to provide on its own, to the detriment of society. Pollution laws and police departments are classic examples. In the case of finance - and of the crisis of the past two years - this missing good has been strong regulation. Read more 
"Riding the Mo in the Lime Green Glow,"
by Matthew Klam (Nov. 21, 1999)
The stock market opens and Dave Goehl immediately makes a $230 profit on 500 shares of eGroup, which he bought yesterday, by accident. Dave is buying and selling securities on the Nasdaq exchange in his shorts and a T-shirt from the convenience of his spare bedroom. ''It's the neatest thing in the world,'' he says. Read more 
"The End of the Financial World as We Know it,"
by Michael Lewis and David Einhorn (Jan. 3, 2009)
Americans enter the New Year in a strange new role: financial lunatics. We've been viewed by the wider world with mistrust and suspicion on other matters, but on the subject of money even our harshest critics have been inclined to believe that we knew what we were doing.Read more

HEADLINE: Podcast: Bonds, Markets, the Economy and History

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen.

 BODY:
The markets are being whipsawed. How severe has the volatility been? One statistic tells the story: for the first time in its history, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index moved up or down by at least 4 percent on four consecutive days. 
In the new Weekend Business podcast, I talked to Floyd Norris and Julie Creswell, two veteran financial reporters for The Times, about the turmoil in the markets. Ms. Creswell has been covering the impact on individual investors and says many have been rushing to sell their stock holdings. 
Of course, selling in a downturn is not always the best approach, Mr. Norris pointed out, especially if markets rise again soon. A big issue at the moment is whether we are experiencing a repeat of the 2008-9 crisis, when markets fell far more steeply than they have in recent weeks, or whether the current situation is more benign. Unfortunately, there are no firm answers.
One reason for the plunge in asset values is a global economic slowdown. In a separate conversation on the podcast, Christina Romer, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, says the Great Depression and World War II supply some important lessons for dealing with the current crisis. In the Economic View column in Sunday Business, she says that expansive monetary and fiscal policy worked well back then to promote economic growth. In addition, the United States took on a far heavier debt load in the war years than it has so far, and still managed to pay it down when the economy was stronger.

Reconciling economic stimulus with a prudent long-term fiscal policy can be done again, she says, but the logic for these intertwined approaches needs to be conveyed forcefully to the American public.
I also chatted with Steve Lohr, a Times technology reporter, about a new approach to corporate social responsibility. In the Unboxed column in Sunday Business, he says academic theorists are proposing a concept known as shared value, in which companies profit by taking on tasks that result in public good. One example is General Electric's "ecomagination" program, in which the company has invested in technology to lower the energy consumption of its products and to reduce the use of water and other resources in manufacturing. The company says its sole motive has been profit; the social benefits are ancillary.
And in another podcast conversation, Phyllis Korkki interviewed me about the implications of the downgrading of United States Treasury debt, the subject of my Strategies column in Sunday Business. Treasury bonds have been the linchpin of the world financial system, and the center of myriad calculations in business, portfolio construction and capital markets. The 10-year Treasury yield has been plugged into countless algorithms as the putative "risk-free rate of return," against which other cash flows are compared. Now, the rate for a risk-free investment may need to be approximated, and the center of the global financial structure seems much less solid than it was just a few years ago.

HEADLINE: Podcast: Bonds, Markets, the Economy and History

BYLINE: JEFF SOMMER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the latest Weekend Business podcast, and a listen.

 BODY:
The markets are being whipsawed. How severe has the volatility been? One statistic tells the story: for the first time in its history, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index moved up or down by at least 4 percent on four consecutive days. 
In the new Weekend Business podcast, I talked to Floyd Norris and Julie Creswell, two veteran financial reporters for The Times, about the turmoil in the markets. Ms. Creswell has been covering the impact on individual investors and says many have been rushing to sell their stock holdings. 
Of course, selling in a downturn is not always the best approach, Mr. Norris pointed out, especially if markets rise again soon. A big issue at the moment is whether we are experiencing a repeat of the 2008-9 crisis, when markets fell far more steeply than they have in recent weeks, or whether the current situation is more benign. Unfortunately, there are no firm answers.
One reason for the plunge in asset values is a global economic slowdown. In a separate conversation on the podcast, Christina Romer, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, says the Great Depression and World War II supply some important lessons for dealing with the current crisis. In the Economic View column in Sunday Business, she says that expansive monetary and fiscal policy worked well back then to promote economic growth. In addition, the United States took on a far heavier debt load in the war years than it has so far, and still managed to pay it down when the economy was stronger.

Reconciling economic stimulus with a prudent long-term fiscal policy can be done again, she says, but the logic for these intertwined approaches needs to be conveyed forcefully to the American public.
I also chatted with Steve Lohr, a Times technology reporter, about a new approach to corporate social responsibility. In the Unboxed column in Sunday Business, he says academic theorists are proposing a concept known as shared value, in which companies profit by taking on tasks that result in public good. One example is General Electric's "ecomagination" program, in which the company has invested in technology to lower the energy consumption of its products and to reduce the use of water and other resources in manufacturing. The company says its sole motive has been profit; the social benefits are ancillary.
And in another podcast conversation, Phyllis Korkki interviewed me about the implications of the downgrading of United States Treasury debt, the subject of my Strategies column in Sunday Business. Treasury bonds have been the linchpin of the world financial system, and the center of myriad calculations in business, portfolio construction and capital markets.

HEADLINE: Cain's Iowa Pitch: Reduce Taxes Rates in 3 Months

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: At the Iowa State Fair, Herman Cain said he is running because of the "deficiency of leadership" in Washington.

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- The procession of presidential candidates through the Iowa State Fair started Friday morning with Herman Cain, who declared that he is running for president because of a "deficiency of leadership" in Washington.
Mr. Cain, a former C.E.O. of Godfather's Pizza, said he is often told that he does not understand how Washington works.
"Yes I do," he said. "It doesn't!"
Mr. Cain, a long-shot to win the Republican nomination, pledged to reduce tax rates within his first 90 days in office. He said that is how the country can "put fuel in the engine" and create economic growth.
"Why am I running for president? Like I said, it's for the children and the grandchildren," he said, relating the story of how he survived a bout with cancer.
"I happen to believe that God wanted me to stay here so I could try and make a difference," he said.

HEADLINE: Is London Burning?

BYLINE: CLAY RISEN


HIGHLIGHT: Have the London riots exposed the weaknesses in Prime Minister David Cameron's leadership?

 BODY:
A week that began as what many called Prime Minister David Cameron's "Katrina Moment" ended as, well, what? 
The riots that shook London and several other English cities have undoubtedly altered a political landscape already in turmoil over the News of the World phone-hacking scandal. But where they leave a fragile No. 10 Downing Street is anyone's guess.
When the unrest began on Saturday, Mr. Cameron was on vacation in Tuscany - which is wonderful this time of year, but hardly the place a politician wants to be caught out when commodity riots begin back home. Even worse, Mr. Cameron's first reaction was to try and manage things from afar; on Sunday he made news by going back to a cafe where he had accidentally snubbed a waitress the day before to apologize. When he hadn't returned by Tuesday, Shane Stone asked at Dale & Co., a conservative political blog:
Has Cameron ruined his reputation?

History says that George Bush was too slow to respond to Hurricane Katrina. He was however in country and still working but arguably should have diverted to Louisiana sooner than he did. When the Port Arthur shootings occurred in 1996 John Howard's response was instantaneous as it was for every natural disaster that occurred during his prime ministership. Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg was front and centre from the moment the news started to come through of the bombing and slaughter. As I sat watching my television as events unfolded in London I was wondering where the UK's leadership was; apparently on the continent on holiday.
Mr. Cameron's absence not only opened him to criticism for being out of touch; it also left the field open to his political enemies to define the emerging debate over what caused the riots. Kenneth Livingstone, the left-leaning former mayor of London, wasted no time, releasing a statement on Sunday that blamed the riots on recent austerity measures by the Cameron government:
While the first priority is to restore peace, to ensure the safety of everyone now and in the future it is also necessary to have a serious discussion about why this has happened.
I am concerned that there is growing social dislocation in London and a threat that the police will be forced into escalating conflict with some London communities. We do not want to go back to the 1980s.
The economic stagnation and cuts being imposed by the Tory government inevitably create social division. As when Margaret Thatcher imposed such policies during her recessions this creates the threat of people losing control, acting in completely unacceptable ways that threaten everyone, and culminating in events of the type we saw in Tottenham.
Tories will issue knee-jerk statements demanding support for the police but they are actually cutting the police. That amounts to pure hypocrisy.
Over the next few days a raft of Labor politicians and left-liberal commentators chimed in with agreement. The columnist Polly Toynbee wrote on Aug. 12:
The small-staters blame the collapse of moral values, school indiscipline and feral beasts without fathers or consciences, as if removing government allows morality to flourish. But take government and regulation away and see discord follow - from Sir Fred (Scottish Calvinist) Goodwin to all the other looters. Grab what you can, winner takes all, no wealth is ever too much, this neoliberal amoral creed has reigned unquestioned since Margaret Thatcher. [London Mayor] Boris Johnson blames the rioters' "extreme sense of entitlement," but his success from Bullingdon restaurant-trasher onwards has been based on never questioning his own entitlement. L'Oreal's "Because I'm worth it" the slogan of our times, is a close relative of "Because I can," which stretches from Barclays chief Bob Diamond to the Debenhams window-smasher.
Yet the "bring back morality" right rages on. So let's try agreeing with Cameron and the Mail. Yes, murderers ought to get life. The rest of the rioters are getting harsher than usual sentences. So lock up the wild beasts in prisons already so overcrowded they will learn nothing, most emerging to steal again almost immediately. Go on, take away their benefits, evict them from their council homes. But then what? Nothing at all, no government action, no state interventions? How will doing nothing else stop it happening again?
But a counterargument soon emerged, one that explained the rioters as petty criminals and the rioting as a symptom not of budget cuts, but a decline in respect for law and order. Paul McGregor, a resident
of Moreton, in northwest England, put it well in a letter to the Independent:
Coming from a working-class family and having lived for 20 years on a council estate, I beg to differ with your paper's analysis of the situation on Britain's streets.
The rioting is not because the "underclass" has been ignored; it is because it has been embraced. It has been embraced by those who set the norms in our society - cinema, television, magazines and even the middle-class intellectuals who write opinion columns for The Independent.
We see in contemporary Britain an unprecedented glorification of ugliness, irresponsibility and underclass conduct in clothing, language, music, literature and the media while so-called "middle-class" values have undergone 50 or more years of cynical erosion. So let us not be surprised when this "underclass" conduct spills onto the streets.
The barbarians are inside the walls because the gatekeepers gave them the keys.
Or, as Jerry Hayes, a former conservative member of Parliament, asked provocatively:
Should we make hoodies illegal?
That gentle and predominantly tolerant giant of English public opinion has been awakened and is roaring outrage. The silent majority is screaming for justice and shaking with shock, anger, disbelief and horror that an Englishman's home is no longer his castle.
But the real shock is why none of these Blackberry riots has happened sooner.
We have been building up to them for years. The feral youths who arrogantly swagger around our communities delighting in causing terror, mayhem and nuisance to ordinary decent people trying to live their lives in peace, have been with us for a very long time. They were rather quaintly accused of anti social behavior. And those grimfaced, drug ridden, hooded scum who steal from their local Asian convenience stores as a pastime, have been part of our culture for time immemorial.
Indeed, in a poll by ICM asking for the main reason for the riots, 45 percent said "criminal individuals" and 28 percent said a lack of respect in families and communities; only 8 percent said unemployment and only 2 percent said the economic situation. An online petition to cut off public benefits to rioters drew over 100,000 signatures within a few days. It's also worth noting that while it may be the case that the Cameron government's austerity measures gave the signal that the government no longer cared and thus set alienated youth on an anomic looting spree, the cuts themselves hadn't actually set in yet.
Both sides seemed to agree on one thing: that the riots set the stage for a debate about British society and where it was headed, something that neither Mr. Cameron nor his Labor predecessors had been able to accomplish. Others, though, saw the riot "debate" as a function of political fingerpointing. Seumas Milne, a columnist writing in the Guardian, said:
We'll hear a lot more of that when parliament meets - and it's not hard to see why. If these riots have no social or political causes, then clearly no one in authority can be held responsible. What's more, with many people terrified by the mayhem and angry at the failure of the police to halt its spread, it offers the government a chance to get back on the front foot and regain its seriously damaged credibility as a force for social order.
And that's exactly what Mr. Cameron tried to do, cutting his vacation short and arriving back in London on Aug. 9. He recalled Parliament from recess and gave a dashing speech before it on Thursday:
Keeping people safe is the first duty of government. The whole country has been shocked by the most appalling scenes of people looting, violence, vandalising and thieving. It is criminality pure and simple. And there is absolutely no excuse for it.
We have seen houses, offices and shops raided and torched, police officers assaulted and fire crews attacked as they try to put out fires, people robbing others while they lie injured and bleeding in the street, and even three innocent people being deliberately run over and killed in Birmingham. Mr Speaker, we will not put up with this in our country. We will not allow a culture of fear to exist on our streets. And we will do whatever it takes to restore law and order and to rebuild our communities.
The speech impressed observers outside as well as inside Parliament; Ed Miliband, head of Labor, said his party stood squarely behind the prime minister. But Mr. Cameron may nevertheless have overplayed his hand. Implying that the cops had coddled the rioters, he told Parliament:
Police chiefs have been frank with me about why this happened. Initially the police treated the situation too much as a public order issue - rather than essentially one of crime. The truth is that the police have been facing a new and unique challenge with different people doing the same thing - basically looting - in different places all at the same time.
Perhaps intending to soften the blow, Mr. Cameron also promised a range of get-tough measures against future riots: putting more cops on the street, turning water cannons on unruly mobs, spraying rioters with dye to make them identifiable later, temporarily shut down social-networking programs and calling out the military if the police are overwhelmed. 
This might have been catnip for an angry few, but it failed to quell the groundswell of anger at Scotland Yard. Indeed, the Cameron government is refusing to rethink its plan to axe 2 billion pounds over four years from the police budget, raising questions about how, exactly, the police were supposed to take all these steps with a smaller purse. "He is like a scientist who has a pet theory which has been completely debunked by exposure to reality," Paul McKeever, president of the Police Federation, said. "But he refuses to face that. The 16,000 officers who have been on the streets in London are the number he wants to cut - that is the reality."
Mr. Cameron's misstep meant that, for the moment, the Tories have failed to capture the public's law-and-order anger, which now rests with the police. It's a fortuitous turn for the institution, which has seen its public image tarnished in recent years by incidents like the questionable shooting death of Jean Charles de Menezes, a Brazilian man whom London police shot after misidentifying him as a suspect in a failed bombing attempt. After the riots, that antipathy may be in for a reconsideration, a turn given further impetus by an ill-advised attack by an unpopular political leader.
The problem for Mr. Cameron is that while the public anger clearly leans right, it's not leaning toward his particular brand of small-government conservatism. Still, some commentators think history is on Mr. Cameron's side. As Bagehot, the Economist's pseudonymous columnist for British affairs, wrote: 
In 2000 the Labour government mishandled fuel-tax protests; the country reeled for a week. But the party strolled to re-election nine months later. The crisis had not shifted the national mood on tax-and-spend in any lasting way. Thatcherism did not happen simply because James Callaghan erred tactically during the industrial unrest of 1978, but because that crisis finally snapped the public's patience with post-war corporatism.
And so to the latest crisis. The political implications of the riots that began ravaging parts of London and other cities on August 6th are not to be found in David Cameron's itinerary during those days. Voters are unlikely to damn him permanently for remaining in Tuscany until the urban infernos forced him home. Neither will they reward him for recalling Parliament and conspicuously camping out in Cabinet Office Briefing Room A - or COBRA, to give the room its more impressive-sounding acronym - when he got back. What matters is whether the political debate has changed in ways that suit a Conservative prime minister. There are reasons to believe it has.
First, only the most blinkered liberal could deny that the terms of trade in the debate between freedom and order have become more favourable to the latter. Tories will have an easier time making their already-popular arguments about crime: that well-meaning efforts to liberalise the police have gone too far; that weakness is more provocative to miscreants than heavy-handedness; that for all the talk of a "slippery slope" from minor breaches of liberty by the state to outright authoritarianism, the opposite journey - from laxity to lawlessness - is steeper and scarier.
Policing could become as hotly discussed in Westminster as any of the public services. It is curious that it is not already. The theology of academic selection and university funding grips the political and media classes but the polls are clear: crime is a bigger worry for voters than education.
Second, and more speculatively, the backlash could extend beyond crime to include welfare and other social issues. The left is imploring the public to consider the underlying causes of the riots. They should be careful what they wish for. Voters might conclude that the deep-seated causes are not poverty, discrimination and austerity - the riots took place in a country whose government currently spends half of its national income-but welfare dependency, broken homes and moral nihilism.
The key, Bagehot writes, is for Mr. Cameron to return to his old-school, "Big Society" roots - clear during the 2010 campaign but since cloaked behind fiscal conservatism - that portray British society fraying under the twin assault of too much government and too much market. Britons, he said, needed to get back in touch with their neighbors, their families, their communities, and build support networks that could truly insulate them from the slings and arrows of outrageous globalization. 
As Mr. Cameron said in 2007, while still in the opposition, "What builds society, what encourages civility, is people taking responsibility. Putting each other before themselves. Parents understanding that it is their responsibility, not the school's responsibility, to bring their kids up with the right values. Neighbors understanding that it is their responsibility, not just the council's responsibility, to look out for each other. Business people understanding that it is their responsibility, not just the government's responsibility, to think about the social and environmental consequences of what they do."
No one was quite sure what it meant in policy terms, though programs to facilitate neighborhood organizations and volunteerism seemed to play a key role. It sounded then like an Anglicized version of George W. Bush's "compassionate conservatism," and perhaps it was. Whether it would work is one question; whether Mr. Cameron has the guts, or even the inclination, to try it is another.

As when Margaret Thatcher imposed such policies during her recessions this creates the threat of people losing control, acting in completely unacceptable ways that threaten everyone, and culminating in events of the type we saw in Tottenham.
Tories will issue knee-jerk statements demanding support for the police but they are actually cutting the police. That amounts to pure hypocrisy.
Over the next few days a raft of Labor politicians and left-liberal commentators chimed in with agreement. The columnist Polly Toynbee wrote on Aug. 12:
The small-staters blame the collapse of moral values, school indiscipline and feral beasts without fathers or consciences, as if removing government allows morality to flourish. But take government and regulation away and see discord follow - from Sir Fred (Scottish Calvinist) Goodwin to all the other looters. Grab what you can, winner takes all, no wealth is ever too much, this neoliberal amoral creed has reigned unquestioned since Margaret Thatcher. [London Mayor] Boris Johnson blames the rioters' "extreme sense of entitlement," but his success from Bullingdon restaurant-trasher onwards has been based on never questioning his own entitlement. L'Oreal's "Because I'm worth it" the slogan of our times, is a close relative of "Because I can," which stretches from Barclays chief Bob Diamond to the Debenhams window-smasher.
Yet the "bring back morality" right rages on. So let's try agreeing with Cameron and the Mail. Yes, murderers ought to get life. The rest of the rioters are getting harsher than usual sentences. So lock up the wild beasts in prisons already so overcrowded they will learn nothing, most emerging to steal again almost immediately. Go on, take away their benefits, evict them from their council homes. But then what? Nothing at all, no government action, no state interventions? How will doing nothing else stop it happening again?
But a counterargument soon emerged, one that explained the rioters as petty criminals and the rioting as a symptom not of budget cuts, but a decline in respect for law and order. Paul McGregor, a resident
of Moreton, in northwest England, put it well in a letter to the Independent:
Coming from a working-class family and having lived for 20 years on a council estate, I beg to differ with your paper's analysis of the situation on Britain's streets.
The rioting is not because the "underclass" has been ignored; it is because it has been embraced. It has been embraced by those who set the norms in our society - cinema, television, magazines and even the middle-class intellectuals who write opinion columns for The Independent.
We see in contemporary Britain an unprecedented glorification of ugliness, irresponsibility and underclass conduct in clothing, language, music, literature and the media while so-called "middle-class" values have undergone 50 or more years of cynical erosion. So let us not be surprised when this "underclass" conduct spills onto the streets.
The barbarians are inside the walls because the gatekeepers gave them the keys.
Or, as Jerry Hayes, a former conservative member of Parliament, asked provocatively:
Should we make hoodies illegal?
That gentle and predominantly tolerant giant of English public opinion has been awakened and is roaring outrage. The silent majority is screaming for justice and shaking with shock, anger, disbelief and horror that an Englishman's home is no longer his castle.
But the real shock is why none of these Blackberry riots has happened sooner.
We have been building up to them for years. The feral youths who arrogantly swagger around our communities delighting in causing terror, mayhem and nuisance to ordinary decent people trying to live their lives in peace, have been with us for a very long time. They were rather quaintly accused of anti social behavior. And those grimfaced, drug ridden, hooded scum who steal from their local Asian convenience stores as a pastime, have been part of our culture for time immemorial.
Indeed, in a poll by ICM asking for the main reason for the riots, 45 percent said "criminal individuals" and 28 percent said a lack of respect in families and communities; only 8 percent said unemployment and only 2 percent said the economic situation. An online petition to cut off public benefits to rioters drew over 100,000 signatures within a few days. It's also worth noting that while it may be the case that the Cameron government's austerity measures gave the signal that the government no longer cared and thus set alienated youth on an anomic looting spree, the cuts themselves hadn't actually set in yet.
Both sides seemed to agree on one thing: that the riots set the stage for a debate about British society and where it was headed, something that neither Mr. Cameron nor his Labor predecessors had been able to accomplish. Others, though, saw the riot "debate" as a function of political fingerpointing. Seumas Milne, a columnist writing in the Guardian, said:
We'll hear a lot more of that when parliament meets - and it's not hard to see why. If these riots have no social or political causes, then clearly no one in authority can be held responsible. What's more, with many people terrified by the mayhem and angry at the failure of the police to halt its spread, it offers the government a chance to get back on the front foot and regain its seriously damaged credibility as a force for social order.
And that's exactly what Mr. Cameron tried to do, cutting his vacation short and arriving back in London on Aug. 9. He recalled Parliament from recess and gave a dashing speech before it on Thursday:
Keeping people safe is the first duty of government. The whole country has been shocked by the most appalling scenes of people looting, violence, vandalising and thieving. It is criminality pure and simple. And there is absolutely no excuse for it.
We have seen houses, offices and shops raided and torched, police officers assaulted and fire crews attacked as they try to put out fires, people robbing others while they lie injured and bleeding in the street, and even three innocent people being deliberately run over and killed in Birmingham. Mr Speaker, we will not put up with this in our country. We will not allow a culture of fear to exist on our streets. And we will do whatever it takes to restore law and order and to rebuild our communities.
The speech impressed observers outside as well as inside Parliament; Ed Miliband, head of Labor, said his party stood squarely behind the prime minister. But Mr. Cameron may nevertheless have overplayed his hand. Implying that the cops had coddled the rioters, he told Parliament:
Police chiefs have been frank with me about why this happened. Initially the police treated the situation too much as a public order issue - rather than essentially one of crime. The truth is that the police have been facing a new and unique challenge with different people doing the same thing - basically looting - in different places all at the same time.
Perhaps intending to soften the blow, Mr. Cameron also promised a range of get-tough measures against future riots: putting more cops on the street, turning water cannons on unruly mobs, spraying rioters with dye to make them identifiable later, temporarily shut down social-networking programs and calling out the military if the police are overwhelmed. 
This might have been catnip for an angry few, but it failed to quell the groundswell of anger at Scotland Yard. Indeed, the Cameron government is refusing to rethink its plan to axe 2 billion pounds over four years from the police budget, raising questions about how, exactly, the police were supposed to take all these steps with a smaller purse. "He is like a scientist who has a pet theory which has been completely debunked by exposure to reality," Paul McKeever, president of the Police Federation, said. "But he refuses to face that. The 16,000 officers who have been on the streets in London are the number he wants to cut - that is the reality."
Mr. Cameron's misstep meant that, for the moment, the Tories have failed to capture the public's law-and-order anger, which now rests with the police. It's a fortuitous turn for the institution, which has seen its public image tarnished in recent years by incidents like the questionable shooting death of Jean Charles de Menezes, a Brazilian man whom London police shot after misidentifying him as a suspect in a failed bombing attempt. After the riots, that antipathy may be in for a reconsideration, a turn given further impetus by an ill-advised attack by an unpopular political leader.
The problem for Mr. Cameron is that while the public anger clearly leans right, it's not leaning toward his particular brand of small-government conservatism. Still, some commentators think history is on Mr. Cameron's side. As Bagehot, the Economist's pseudonymous columnist for British affairs, wrote: 
In 2000 the Labour government mishandled fuel-tax protests; the country reeled for a week. But the party strolled to re-election nine months later. The crisis had not shifted the national mood on tax-and-spend in any lasting way. Thatcherism did not happen simply because James Callaghan erred tactically during the industrial unrest of 1978, but because that crisis finally snapped the public's patience with post-war corporatism.
And so to the latest crisis. The political implications of the riots that began ravaging parts of London and other cities on August 6th are not to be found in David Cameron's itinerary during those days. Voters are unlikely to damn him permanently for remaining in Tuscany until the urban infernos forced him home. Neither will they reward him for recalling Parliament and conspicuously camping out in Cabinet Office Briefing Room A - or COBRA, to give the room its more impressive-sounding acronym - when he got back. What matters is whether the political debate has changed in ways that suit a Conservative prime minister. There are reasons to believe it has.
First, only the most blinkered liberal could deny that the terms of trade in the debate between freedom and order have become more favourable to the latter. Tories will have an easier time making their already-popular arguments about crime: that well-meaning efforts to liberalise the police have gone too far; that weakness is more provocative to miscreants than heavy-handedness; that for all the talk of a "slippery slope" from minor breaches of liberty by the state to outright authoritarianism, the opposite journey - from laxity to lawlessness - is steeper and scarier.
Policing could become as hotly discussed in Westminster as any of the public services. It is curious that it is not already. The theology of academic selection and university funding grips the political and media classes but the polls are clear: crime is a bigger worry for voters than education.
Second, and more speculatively, the backlash could extend beyond crime to include welfare and other social issues. The left is imploring the public to consider the underlying causes of the riots. They should be careful what they wish for. Voters might conclude that the deep-seated causes are not poverty, discrimination and austerity - the riots took place in a country whose government currently spends half of its national income-but welfare dependency, broken homes and moral nihilism.
The key, Bagehot writes, is for Mr. Cameron to return to his old-school, "Big Society" roots - clear during the 2010 campaign but since cloaked behind fiscal conservatism - that portray British society fraying under the twin assault of too much government and too much market. Britons, he said, needed to get back in touch with their neighbors, their families, their communities, and build support networks that could truly insulate them from the slings and arrows of outrageous globalization. 
As Mr. Cameron said in 2007, while still in the opposition,
What builds society, what encourages civility, is people taking responsibility. Putting each other before themselves. Parents understanding that it is their responsibility, not the school's responsibility, to bring their kids up with the right values. Neighbors understanding that it is their responsibility, not just the council's responsibility, to look out for each other. Business people understanding that it is their responsibility, not just the government's responsibility, to think about the social and environmental consequences of what they do.
No one was quite sure what it meant in policy terms, though programs to facilitate neighborhood organizations and volunteerism seemed to play a key role. It sounded then like an Anglicized version of George W. Bush's "compassionate conservatism," and perhaps it was. Whether it would work is one question; whether Mr. Cameron has the guts, or even the inclination, to try it is another.

HIGHLIGHT: Among this week's topics tracked on Twitter: the closing of the Statue of Liberty, the death of a governor and overheard in the Conde Nast elevator.

 BODY:
Fiscal calamity? Deceased former governor? Middling Jay-Z album?
New Yorkers had a rough week. On Twitter, thank goodness, no wound is too fresh to poke at in 140 characters or fewer.
On Sunday, many users mourned the death of Gov. Hugh L. Carey, praising the former governor's handling of the city's economic crisis in the 1970s. Some found occasion to unearth Mr. Carey's quips, which revealed him to be a man of his time. Quoting the governor, @erickuo posted:

An assault on pop singer Gavin DeGraw in the East Village this week demanded similar gravitas. Amidst the fan tributes and occasional gripes about his music, @EJdance85 tested a new verb:
Kinda scared to walk thru east village now... I don't wanna get gavin degraw'd.Wed Aug 10 12:26:00 via Twitter for BlackBerryEJ
EJdance85
The release of "Watch the Throne," an album by Kanye West and Jay-Z, had New Yorkers at least as spooked. Though tracks like "No Church in the Wild," "Murder to Excellence" and "Lift Off" generated heavy traffic, reviews among the city's Twitter users were mixed. @iDstroy suggested that Jay-Z, a 41-year-old megamillionaire with a wife some might consider attractive, could be losing touch with his gritty Brooklyn upbringing, posting:
Jay-Z should have to go back and sell drugs for a year if he wants to keep rapping about it.Wed Aug 10 13:33:44 via webD-Stroy

He is not the only local icon becoming less accessible. Users also lamented the looming closing of the Statue of Liberty, which will restrict indoor access over the next year to undergo renovations. @MikeHadge, a Twitter user from Astoria, wrote:

New Yorkers took solace, at least, in welcoming a new member to the Twitter community at least for a while: @CondeElevator, a compilation of anonymous observations from the elevators in the Conde Nast Building, which houses magazines like Vogue and The New Yorker. The account gained more than 65,000 followers in its first week, and spawned imitators focusing on Hearst magazines and Goldman Sachs.
Some Conde gems chronicled journalism's daily challenges:

Others tackled weightier matters:

Alas, Twitter's latest treasure was short-lived. As curious parties scrambled to identify the source of the account, the user pulled the plug.

HEADLINE: Talk of Reform in N.C.A.A. Does Not Address Major Problems

BYLINE: By PETE THAMEL

 BODY:
The N.C.A.A. is infamous for having meetings about subcommittees and subcommittees about meetings. So when about 50 college presidents, along with other athletic officials, gathered in Indianapolis this week to discuss the sordid state of college athletics, they surely produced new blisters while wringing their hands.
Larry Scott, the commissioner of the Pacific 12, recently expressed his worries about the N.C.A.A.'s lack of dexterity, and these meetings again showed that the N.C.A.A. moves as nimbly as a nose tackle on a high wire. 
In a conference call Thursday, N.C.A.A. leaders said that they would consider paying student-athletes full scholarship cost, raising standards for incoming recruits and stiffening graduation requirements for postseason play and bowl game eligibility.
But after a year defined by off-field scandal, the meetings failed to address the N.C.A.A.'s most corrosive problems: middlemen who sell players, summer basketball coaches who broker deals with boosters and the abuse in payments for unofficial visits.
''Business as usual is not acceptable,'' Ed Ray, the president of Oregon State, said.
Two key people who did not attend the meetings were Mike Slive, the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, and his counterpart in the Big Ten, Jim Delany. Few would dispute that they are the most powerful men in college sports. Although the presidents of Hope College and Molloy College might have provided keen insight into the future of college athletics, they are not exactly the rainmakers.
That is because conference commissioners have become ever more powerful in the past decade. Their duties include being chief negotiators of billion dollar television contracts, administrators of coach and player punishment, and compliance firemen.
Slive and Delany are as much a part of the problem as they are a part of the solution. Since Mark A. Emmert became president of the N.C.A.A. last year, he has been pummeled in a blur of controversies, highlighted by the cases of two quarterbacks: Cam Newton, whose father shopped him to Mississippi State before Newton enrolled at Auburn, and Terrelle Pryor, who sold memorabilia while at Ohio State.
Emmert basically inherited these problems, but he has also perpetuated them. The Auburn and Ohio State situations were made worse because of the actions of Slive and Delany, and the feeble reactions of the N.C.A.A.
Slive and Delany, who are bitter rivals, spoke at their media days about the need for change in college sports. But last football season, each had a perfect opportunity to show he meant what he said as the Newton and Pryor cases unfolded. They instead chose to chase dollars and bowl victories, their talk of reform sounding more like empty rhetoric.
If Slive were serious about reform, he would have made sure that the SEC reported to the N.C.A.A. months before it did that Newton's father was seeking to send his son to a college that would pay him $180,000. (And then not tried to blame Mississippi State after his league bungled the case.)
Slive could also have insisted that Auburn sit Newton during the investigation. Instead, Newton led the Tigers to the Bowl Championship Series title, and Auburn is erecting a statue of him -- the perfect emblem of the SEC's problems -- as the N.C.A.A. inquiry continues.
If Delany were serious about reform and punishing bad behavior, he could volunteer to return the $6 million the Big Ten earned through Ohio State's slot in the Sugar Bowl. The N.C.A.A. delayed the suspension of Buckeyes stars, including Pryor, until after the Sugar Bowl. The decision backfired, as Ohio State Coach Jim Tressel resigned, and Delany and the N.C.A.A. looked like apologists for cheats.
Emmert, in a conference call Thursday, said the perception held by many coaches and athletic directors that Delany and Slive had bullied him in these cases was ''plain wrong.'' He added, ''People who want to believe that are going to believe it.''
To take control back, Emmert can sponsor and shepherd significant change that addresses the real problems and forces behavior modification. Scholarship and academic reform, the main topics to emerge from these meetings, will help clean up the polluted culture of college sports as much as throwing pennies in a fountain will stimulate the economy.
One idea broached in Indianapolis was to make coaches accountable for the actions of their assistants, something that could prompt an actual change in behavior. Another was the stiffer and more uniform application of penalties, which the N.C.A.A. will have plenty of opportunity to showcase with infractions cases involving Tennessee, Ohio State and North Carolina.
We would know the N.C.A.A. was serious if it ignored the billion dollar television contracts of commissioners like Slive and Delany and barred wayward teams from TV. (Many worry that Emmert's hesitation to take on the power brokers stems from the N.C.A.A.'s deep-rooted fear that if it exerts too much control, the major conferences will break away.)
One way to encourage compliance would be to bar universities from enrolling athletes for whom they committed violations while recruiting, the root of many N.C.A.A. problems. Another important step would be to make the process for reporting N.C.A.A. violations uniform, taking away a conference's ability to legislate potential troubles away.
The first step for Emmert is to establish that the N.C.A.A. is in charge and cannot be bullied or avoided. If the presidents really are in charge, and not the commissioners, they need to start acting the part. The N.C.A.A. still has not closed the loophole that allowed Newton's father to shop him around. Emmert chalked that up to the complexity of the issues surrounding agents and third parties.
''Those who say we're incapable of moving quickly will be pleasantly surprised in the weeks and coming months,'' Emmert said.
After yet another N.C.A.A. meeting that ended with optimism and the trading of compliments, actions will speak much louder than words in the coming months.

HEADLINE: When Will You Retire? Market swings show why risks in retirement savings need to be shared

 BODY:
Is this any way to plan for retirement? After a week of huge swings, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a broad gauge of the market, was modestly higher on Friday but still down for the week. 
On Monday, the market plunged; on Tuesday, it roared back, only to plummet again on Wednesday before soaring on Thursday. As The Times's Floyd Norris and Christine Hauser pointed out on Friday, never before in the history of the S.& P. 500, which dates back to 1928, had there been four alternating days of losses and gains of more than 4 percent.
There have only been two times since the Great Depression when the index has moved at least 4 percent in four straight trading sessions -- in October 1987, when the market crashed, and in November 2008, during some of the darkest days of the financial crisis. Those are not exactly moments in stock market history that inspire investor confidence.
For individual investors, whose ability to retire depends on stock investments in 401(k)'s and other retirement plans, recent swoons are yet another hit. In the Great Recession, the stock market plunged more than 55 percent from its peak in October 2007, finally hitting bottom in March 2009. It has gained 83 percent since then, though at the close of the market on Friday, it remained more than 18 percent below the 2007 peak. If a worker had invested entirely in stocks, retirement might still be a very long way off.
The results would be better if an investor had a retirement portfolio evenly divided between stocks and bonds -- a 5.6 percent gain from the peak in 2007 to the close on Friday. For policy makers, the volatile week is yet another moment to reconsider the risks in 401(k)'s and the need to make retirement savings safer. One of the thorniest problems is that even someone who steadily contributes to a 401(k) and makes sensible investments can still end up with too little, depending solely on whether markets are up or down as retirement nears.
There needs to be a way to ensure that a lifetime of savings cannot be undermined by forces beyond one's control. Alicia Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, has an idea that deserves more study and debate: a new type of savings account -- in addition to Social Security and 401(k)'s -- that would spread the risks among workers, retirees and government.
One thing is sure. Having each individual bear all of the investing risk is not the road to a secure retirement.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Rise, but Pessimism Drives Consumer Sentiment to a 30-Year Low

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Consumer sentiment worsened sharply in early August, falling to the lowest level in more than three decades, even though retail sales posted the biggest gains in four months in July, separate reports on Friday showed.
Consumer sentiment, which hit its lowest since 1980 when the economy was in recession, fell on fears of a stalled recovery combined with gloom from partisan bickering over government debt, the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey reported.
The preliminary August reading on the consumer sentiment index fell to 54.9 in early August, down from 63.7 in July, and has fallen for three months. The August reading was well below the median forecast of 63.0 among economists polled by Reuters. 
However, retail sales climbed 0.5 percent in July, the biggest increase since March, after a revised 0.3 percent gain in June, according to the Commerce Department.
''People's spending doesn't always correspond with their mood,'' said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Pierpont Securities in Stamford, Conn. ''I doubt things are as weak as the sentiment readings suggest, but no doubt people will be cautious in August.''
High unemployment, stagnant wages and the protracted debate in Congress over raising the government debt ceiling alarmed consumers in the University of Michigan survey even before the downgrade of United States sovereign debt by Standard & Poor's. The consumer sentiment index registered most of the decline before the credit rating downgrade on Aug. 5.
''Never before in the history of the surveys have so many consumers spontaneously mentioned negative aspects of the government's role,'' the survey director, Richard Curtin, said in a statement.
''This was more than the simple recognition that traditional monetary and fiscal policy measures were largely spent. It was the realization that the government was unable or unwilling to act,'' Mr. Curtin added.
Bad economic times were expected by 75 percent of all consumers in early August, just below the record peak of 82 percent in 1980. Buying plans for household durables and vehicles declined in early August, falling back to their recession-level lows.
''Obviously this is quite an ugly number,'' said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital in New York.
''How could you have hopes for anything less than what we got, with the markets being in turmoil, the fear, and the U.S. being downgraded? It took the wind out of the stock market a bit, but I don't think it will be that meaningful.''
However, retail sales in July posted the biggest gain since March, tempering fears that the nation's economy might be slipping back into recession.
The 0.5 percent increase was in line with analysts' forecasts and followed an upwardly revised 0.3 percent gain in June.
Excluding autos, sales increased 0.5 percent, well above forecasts for a 0.2 percent gain. The figures were bolstered by a 1.6 percent increase in gasoline station sales, in part reflecting the higher cost of fuel. Retail sales excluding autos, gasoline and building materials rose 0.4 percent.
In another report, the Commerce Department said business inventories rose slightly less than expected in June, suggesting firms remained cautious about future demand at the end of the second quarter. Inventories climbed 0.3 percent, after a downwardly revised 0.9 percent rise in May, the report said. Economists had expected a rise of 0.5 percent in June.

HEADLINE: Foreigners Follow Money to Booming Brazil, Land of $35 Martini

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Myrna Domit contributed reporting from Sao Paulo, Brazil.

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Pondering the financial storms lashing Europe and the United States, Seth Zalkin, a casually dressed American banker, sipped a demitasse and seemed content with his decision to move here in March with his wife and son.
''If the rest of the world is cratering, this is a good place to be,'' said Mr. Zalkin, 39.
For those with even the dimmest memories of Brazil's own debt crisis in the 1980s, the global order has been turned on its head. The American economy may be crawling along, but Brazil's grew at its fastest clip in more than two decades last year and unemployment is at historic lows, part of the nation's transformation from inflationary basket case into one of Washington's top creditors.
With compensation rivaling that on Wall Street, so many foreign bankers, hedge fund managers, oil executives, lawyers and engineers have moved here that prices for prime office space surpassed those in New York this year, making Rio the costliest city in the Americas to lease it, according to the real estate company Cushman & Wakefield. 
A gold rush mind-set is in full swing, with foreign work permits surging 144 percent in the past five years and Americans leading the pack of educated professionals putting down stakes.
Businessmen have long been drawn to Brazil, along with get-rich-quick confidence men, dreamers of Amazonian grandeur and even outlaws like Ronald Biggs, the Briton who absconded here after his 1963 Great Train Robbery.
But now schools catering to American and other English-speaking families have long waiting lists, apartments can cost $10,000 a month in coveted parts of Rio and many of the newcomers hold Ivy League degrees or job experience at the pillars of the global economy.
Once here, they find a country facing a very different challenge than do the United States and Europe: fears that the economy is getting too hot.
One particular shock for newcomers is the strength of Brazil's currency, the real. That may help Brazilians snapping up apartments in places like South Beach in Miami, where properties cost about a third of their equivalents in Rio's exclusive districts. But it also hurts the country's manufacturers and exporters.
So in a bid to prevent it from going even higher, Brazil is now one of the biggest buyers of United States Treasury securities, becoming a larger stakeholder in the ailing American economy. That is a sharp break from the past, when Washington helped cobble together bailout packages for Brazil's financial crises.
''Brazil is doing great, but honestly, every other week I ask myself, 'When is this going to end?' '' said Mark Bures, 42, an American executive who moved here in 1999, just in time to see an abrupt devaluation of the currency and other sharp swings in Brazil's fortunes.
A few veteran American expatriates even remember Brazil's last economic ''miracle'' in the early 1970s, when The Wall Street Journal quoted an ebullient banker at the start of a front-page article who predicted, ''In 10 years, Brazil will be one of the five great powers of the world.'' Instead, the country ended up with daunting levels of foreign debt.
The recent commodities boom and growth in domestic consumption, the result of an expanding middle class, helped turn Brazil into a rising power that bounced back handily from the 2008 global financial crisis. The economy grew 7.5 percent last year and is expected to register about 4 percent growth this year -- slower, but still enviable in the United States.
Yet Brazil offers many challenges to give newcomers pause. Labor legislation favors hiring Brazilians over foreigners, and the lengthy process of obtaining a work visa can surprise those unaccustomed to Brazil's gargantuan bureaucracy.
Some economists consider the Brazilian real the world's most overvalued currency against the dollar and inflation has climbed (as evidenced by $6.16 Big Macs and $35 martinis). Interest rates remain stubbornly high and analysts debate whether a credit bubble is forming as consumers continue a multiyear spree on everything from homes to cars.
Brazil is hardly immune to the turbulence in global markets, and its currency has weakened a bit this month. Rio's real estate has been bustling as soccer's World Cup in 2014 and the Olympic Games in 2016 approach, but its infrastructure is inadequate. Violent crime, though falling in some areas, plagues big parts of the country and Rio, which suffered through a traumatic bus hijacking this month.
Still, foreigners are arriving, and work authorizations for them jumped more than 30 percent in 2010 alone, according to the Labor Ministry.
''I had very basic Portuguese, but I could tell this place was booming,'' said Michelle Noyes, 29, a New Yorker who organized a hedge fund conference in Sao Paulo. Shortly after, she made the leap to Brazil for a job at a Sao Paulo asset management firm.
''I moved from the periphery of the industry to the center,'' said Ms. Noyes, citing five other Americans, two from New York and three from Chicago, who are moving to Brazil this month to try their luck.
Americans form the largest group moving here, followed by contingents of Britons and other Europeans. Some are on temporary assignments. Others are starting ventures big and small.
David Neeleman, the American founder of JetBlue Airways, recently created Azul, a low-cost Brazilian airline. Corrado Varoli, an Italian who oversaw Goldman Sachs' Latin American operations from New York, now runs his own Sao Paulo boutique investment bank. New Brazilian dot-coms like Baby.com.br, an online diaper retailer founded this year by two American cousins fresh out of business schools like Wharton and Harvard's, sometimes give Brazil a bubbly feel not unlike that of the United States in 1999.
Others foreigners take jobs at Brazilian companies thriving from a boom partly created by Brazil's trade with China.
''Our salaries here in Brazil are at least 50 percent more than salaries in the U.S. for strategic positions,'' said Jacques Sarfatti, country manager for Russell Reynolds, a company that recruits business executives.
Foreigners compete with Brazilians returning home from abroad. ''It's really obvious that the labor market is so bad elsewhere,'' said Dara Chapman, 45, a Californian who is a partner in a Rio hedge fund, Polo Capital. She said she was receiving so many resumes from would-be transplants from the United States that they were a ''dime a dozen.''
Brazil's huge deep-sea oil discoveries have also drawn investors and foreigners, including thousands of Filipinos working on ships and offshore oil platforms. For its other industries, Brazil needs an estimated 60,000 new engineers, some of whom must come from abroad, given the country's lagging educational system.
''I moved from Beijing a year ago and find the potential for professional development incredible,'' said Cynthia Yuanxiu Zhang, 27, a Chinese manager at a technology company. ''I'm already planning to extend my time here well into this decade.''

HEADLINE: Should New York Keep Its Carriage Horses?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Some Carriages Should Not Be Horseless'' (editorial, Aug. 5):
Your support of the carriage horse industry in New York is based on assertions that the ''horses are well treated and monitored closely by the city.'' The opposite is true.
The city has largely abdicated its responsibility to enforce laws governing the carriage horse industry, so the A.S.P.C.A. has stepped up on behalf of the horses. The A.S.P.C.A. finances its enforcement of the cruelty laws using donated money and no government financing. But the A.S.P.C.A. can enforce the laws only as written, which does not mean that the horses are ''well treated.'' 
The typical carriage horse works long hours, while breathing exhaust, for a few years before it may be auctioned off for slaughter. When the horses aren't working, they remain confined in inadequate stalls in New York City; they are often fed substandard food, and many are permanently scarred from wearing their halters too long.
Even when the owners do properly care for their horses, the horses and the public face danger. Every day, concerned New Yorkers contact the A.S.P.C.A. to express their fears of an impending tragedy arising from the carriage horses being in congested traffic.
ED SAYRES President and Chief Exec., A.S.P.C.A. New York, Aug. 7, 2011
To the Editor:
Thank you for your editorial in support of our industry. Our horses lead solid ''blue collar'' lives, unlike the many that are neglected, abandoned or surrendered because of the economy and skyrocketing feed prices.
Horses by the thousands are being auctioned and shipped to slaughterhouses in Mexico and Canada. A horse with a viable job will be the last horse to feel the pinch of economic instability.
Our association is proactive. As a member of the city's rental horse advisory board, we are petitioning for hitching posts, a dedicated carriage lane and microchips to identify horses, and offering input into driver licensing by the Department of Consumer Affairs.
Our safety record is as good as or better than any other horse enterprise one could name, and far surpasses those of racing, jumping and cross country.
We welcome concerns and input, provided that there is an acknowledgment of our right to exist. Politicians with scorched-earth policies, gadfly provocateurs who vilify us, and business concerns that would have us trade in our horses for electric cars need not apply.
The horse-drawn carriages of Central Park are a living piece of New York City history, and we take the stewardship of this iconic, family-friendly -- and horse-friendly -- business seriously.
EVA HUGHES Vice President, New York Horse and Carriage Association Bayside, Queens, Aug. 11, 2011
To the Editor:
I applaud your well-reasoned editorial in support of horse-drawn carriages in New York City.
The carriage horses are well cared for, and the horse-drawn carriage trade has a very good safety record, in your city and elsewhere in this country.
I visited New York only once, as a child, and what I remember most about the trip was a ride in a horse-drawn carriage through Central Park and a visit to the top of the Empire State Building. I guess these memories date me a bit.
If the horse-drawn carriages are banned from New York, the city will be all the poorer for it, and not just monetarily. I can honestly say it was watching the horse-drawn carriage tours in my native city, New Orleans, and my memories of my carriage ride in Central Park that inspired a lifelong dream.
Today, I am a retired teacher with a very small livery service, one horse and carriage. Now, I help create memories that can last a lifetime at weddings and other special occasions. I also conduct horse-drawn carriage tours of my small historic Louisiana town.
Thank you for supporting working horses and their drivers. Horses in the city help preserve its humanity.
MARCIA WILLIS Clinton, La., Aug. 6, 2011
To the Editor:
There is no defense for using horse-drawn carriages in any busy city, much less New York. I was there once and was mortified to see these carriages on the same streets as honking cabs and road-rage drivers.
I've been around horses all my life and would never expose them to such dangerous situations purely for entertainment.
Exploitation of these animals amounts to nothing more than human greed and lack of concern for humaneness. Please put an end to this cruelty.

HEADLINE: Trend to Lighten Harsh Sentences Catches On in Conservative States

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Fanned by the financial crisis, a wave of sentencing and parole reforms is gaining force as it sweeps across the United States, reversing a trend of ''tough on crime'' policies that lasted for decades and drove the nation's incarceration rate to the highest -- and most costly -- level in the developed world.
While liberals have long complained that harsh mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent offenses like drug possession are unjust, the push to overhaul penal policies has been increasingly embraced by elected officials in some of the most conservative states in the country. And for a different reason: to save money. 
Some early results have been dramatic. In 2007, Texas was facing a projected shortfall of about 17,000 inmate beds by 2012. But instead of building and operating new prison space, the State Legislature decided to steer nonviolent offenders into drug treatment and to expand re-entry programs designed to help recently released inmates avoid returning to custody.
As a result, the Texas prison system is now operating so far under its capacity that this month it is closing a 1,100-bed facility in Sugar Land -- the first time in the state's history that a prison has closed. Texas taxpayers have saved hundreds of millions of dollars, and the changes have coincided with the violent crime rate's dipping to its lowest level in 30 years.
''In Texas for the last few years we've been driving down both the crime rate and the incarceration rate,'' said Marc Levin, the director of the Center for Effective Justice at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which helped draft the state's corrections overhaul. ''And it's not just Texas. South Carolina, Kentucky, Arkansas and Ohio in the past year or so have done major reforms. These are certainly not liberal states. That is significant.''
More than a dozen states in recent years have taken steps to reduce the costs to taxpayers of keeping so many criminals locked up. As crime rates have steadily declined to 40-year lows, draining the political potency from crime fears, the fiscal crunch has started to prompt a broad rethinking about alternatives to incarceration.
The 1980s and 1990s saw a wave of stiff new sentencing laws, from mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession to California's three-strikes law imposing an automatic life sentence for a third felony conviction. Partly as a result, the United States, with 5 percent of the world's population, now accounts for 25 percent of the world's inmates. Taxpayers are spending about $50 billion a year on state corrections systems -- nearly twice as much, in inflation-adjusted terms, as expenditures in 1987, according to the Pew Center on the States.
Even before the financial crisis settled in, a handful of states, including NewYork, had begun experimenting with softening mandatory sentences for drug crimes, driven by a mix of concerns about effectiveness, fairness and cost. Texas, an early innovator, mandated probation for low-level possession of many drugs in 2003, before enacting its far more sweeping overhaul of incarceration policies in 2007.
But in the past two years, many more states have enacted -- or are considering adopting in their 2012 legislative sessions -- similar policies, including reducing prison time for low-level drug offenders or diverting them into treatment; granting early release to well-behaved or elderly inmates; expanding job training and re-entry programs; and instituting penalties other than a return to prison for technical violations of parole or probation, like missing a meeting.
At the federal level, Congress last year sharply reduced a steep and racially charged disparity in the sentences handed down for crack cocaine offenses when compared with those for powder cocaine. This summer, the federal Sentencing Commission voted to make some sentence reductions for crack offenses retroactive, allowing about 12,000 federal inmates to apply to a judge to reduce their sentences by an average of three years.
And in May the United States Supreme Court ordered California to reduce severe overcrowding in its prisons, pressuring more states to find ways to lock up fewer people if they do not want to pay what it takes to house swelling inmate populations humanely.
''Over the last few years there has been a dramatic shift in the policy and political landscape on the incarceration issues, and momentum is building,'' said Adam Gelb, the director of a corrections policy project at the Pew Center on the States.
The movement has attracted the support of several prominent conservatives, including Edwin R. Meese III, the attorney general during the Reagan administration. He is part of a campaign, called ''Right on Crime,'' which was begun last December to lend weight to what it calls the ''conservative case for reform.''
''I'd call it a careful refining of the process,'' Mr. Meese said. ''Most of us who are involved in this are very much in favor of high incarceration of serious habitual offenders. The whole idea is getting the right people in prison, and for those people for whom there is evidence that chances of recidivism are less, to work with those people.''
Other Republican affiliates of the group include former House Speaker Newt Gingrich; Grover Norquist, an antitax activist; Asa Hutchinson, a former director of the Drug Enforcement Administration; and William J. Bennett, a former White House ''drug czar.''
The movement has seen some reversals. At least three states -- Washington, Kansas and Delaware -- have cut spending on re-entry programs to help close short-term budget gaps, despite criticism that the cuts could result in higher long-term costs if more parolees returned to prison.
In addition, at least three other states -- Illinois, New Jersey and Wisconsin -- suspended or revoked programs that allowed well-behaved inmates to earn early parole. Earlier this year, for example, New Jersey repealed such a program after two former inmates who had been released early were charged with murders.
Vanita Gupta, the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which published a report this week on the corrections overhaul movement, said that such setbacks showed the fragility of the effort. Ms. Gupta said statistics-based arguments had historically fared poorly in the political arena when countered by anecdotes of specific crimes.
She said it had taken the fiscal crisis to persuade a wider scope of policy makers to set aside such fears and examine the arguments that the United States could incarcerate fewer people without causing crime rates to rise.
''This is the first sustained opportunity we've had as a country to look at our incarceration policies, and it could end, so the work is urgent,'' Ms. Gupta said.

HEADLINE: Investing in Volatility, to Cash In or to Hedge Bets

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
THE stock market in the last week has been the very definition of volatile, up one day, down the next, then up again the day after.
But while most investors care about volatility only when markets go down and their portfolio loses value, volatility works both ways. And smart investors are figuring out ways to smooth out the peaks and valleys.
Tony Roth, head of wealth management strategies at UBS Wealth Management, said he considered volatility a fourth asset class, after stocks, bonds and alternative investments like real estate and hedge funds. And he advises the firm's wealthiest clients to factor it into their portfolio even in good times.
''You're competing in a market with high-speed and hedge fund traders, and they have volatility strategies as a source of returns,'' Mr. Roth said. ''If you're not developing your own strategy for dealing with volatility, you're at a structural disadvantage on the playing field we call financial markets.'' 
While thinking of volatility as an investment may seem as odd as buying air rights for development once did (or still does), devising strategies that limit the highs and lows in the global economy are becoming common. They generally fall into two categories: strategies that look to profit from volatile markets and those that try to cushion a portfolio from those wild swings.
What has changed is that many of these strategies are no longer available only to the most sophisticated investors. (Some of them certainly got a lot more expensive this week.) Two of the strategies I discuss below are accessible to investors with even modest portfolios and two are for wealthier investors, but they show just how much control people can now exert on their returns.
Here's a look at the strategies aimed at giving investors more control over their returns, though, of course, there are some risks.
COLLARS The simplest volatility strategy is combining two types of options to create a range a stock or an index will trade in. This is done by selling a call option, which allows the buyer of that call to purchase shares at a set price, and then buying a put option, which allows the person who owns the shares to force someone else to buy them if they fall to a certain level.
Take United Parcel Service, which was hovering around $63 a share on Monday, the first day of trading after Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States' credit rating. Tyler Vernon, chief investment officer of Biltmore Capital Advisors, which manages $600 million for wealthy families, said that an investor could have sold a call option at $65 a share for $2.50 and for the same amount bought a put option at $60. The costs would cancel each other out and the investor would have created what is called a collar around the stock.
''With volatility kicking up, this is a strategy that more sophisticated investors are taking advantage of,'' Mr. Vernon said. ''They're O.K. giving up the upside after seeing markets fall down by hundreds of points every day.''
Of course, the investor may not get the gains if the U.P.S. stock rises above $65 before the collar expires. But Mr. Vernon said this was a risk most clients were willing to take. ''They're having flashbacks to 2008 at this point, so that's not a bad deal.''
FUTURES CONTRACTS A slightly more complex but relatively inexpensive way to manage losses is to buy futures contracts that bet an index will fall in value.
Mark Coffelt, who manages the Empiric Core Equity Fund, said he hedged the entire $50 million portfolio this week by buying 702 contracts that bet the Russell 2000 index, which tracks small-cap stocks, would fall in value. They cost just $1,400. While the equities in the portfolio still fell in value, the futures contract limited the overall losses.
''Our hedges picked up $2.5 million'' the previous week, Mr. Coffelt said. ''Hedging has helped us tremendously this year. It has not accounted for all the gains, but it sure has reduced some of the losses.''
A big advantage of this strategy is that the markets for futures, particularly with currencies, are easy to trade in and out of. But they require restraint.
''If everything turns around quickly, we're going to lose money, unquestionably,'' said David Kavanagh, president of Grant Park Funds, which has just under $1 billion in a managed futures strategy. ''I can't emphasize the disciplined nature enough. There is always an exit strategy.''
He said that once he took a view on an index, he would look to buy the futures contract that was the most liquid, whether it lasted one month or six.
STRUCTURED NOTES With structured notes, a bank can pretty much create any trading range that clients want through a combination of financial products, including options and derivatives. But these notes are highly complicated, generally illiquid and carry the risk of the firm that created them.
This was an issue when Lehman Brothers went bankrupt in 2008. The firm had sold billions of dollars of structured notes that lost their value when the firm collapsed.
But investors who are comfortable with the firm creating these notes can virtually determine how much economic risk they are comfortable with by using a simple formula: the more appreciation they give up, the more they can protect themselves from losses.
JPMorgan Private Bank is selling one-year notes that offer what Joe Kenney, United States head of investments at the bank, called ''contingent protection.'' They have been structured to give a client as much as 20 percent gains and protect losses down to 20 percent.
On the plus side, the notes pay a guaranteed 8 3/4 percent return even if the market does not rise that much. The downside is that if the losses are greater than 20 percent, the protection expires and the investor gets all the losses.
A NEW TWIST A relatively new strategy relies on publicly traded options and exchange-traded funds to create the same effect as a structured note without the credit risk of a bank.
Mitchell Eichen, president of the MDE Group, which pioneered its ''planned return strategy'' in 2009, said the strategy was meant to protect against the first 12 percent of losses -- with any additional losses starting at that point -- and to double the market gains up to a cap of 8 to 12 percent. Now, some $275 million of the $1.3 billion the firm manages is in this strategy.
One advantage is its transparency: all the parts that create the band are held in a separate account for each investor, with Fidelity as the custodian. Another is that the firm is putting together new offerings monthly in the hope that this product will become like a laddered bond portfolio for its clients.
Philip M. Gross, a retired engineer who worked at Warner Lambert and General Electric, said he had about 15 percent of his money in MDE's planned-return strategy and was adding to it. ''If I thought the market was going straight up over the next three years, I wouldn't do this,'' he said. ''But this is a practical approach.''
The one caveat with this and many of the other strategies is how they are taxed. They are often at the higher short-term capital gains rate or some mix of short- and long-term gains. But taxes are the last thing on Mr. Gross's mind, after the market crashes in 2000 and 2008.
''I'm not sure if I'm ever going to use all my capital losses,'' he said. ''I realize intellectually that's a dumb answer, but it's a practical answer.''
Given that volatility is a practical problem right now, that may be good enough.

HEADLINE: Ushering City Opera Into a New Era

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
To paraphrase the conclusion of Camus's essay ''The Myth of Sisyphus'': one must imagine George Steel happy. And he is more than happy to play along.
''It's difficult to push a boulder up a hill, recognizing that we'll never get there,'' Mr. Steel, the embattled general manager and artistic director of New York City Opera, said over lunch near Lincoln Center the other day. ''This is not how I imagined that it would all go. But it's my job to find a solution, and figuring out how to make it go is satisfying.''
Mr. Steel, who had an acclaimed 11-year run as executive director of the Miller Theater at Columbia University and a three-month flirtation as general director of the Dallas Opera, agrees with Camus, perhaps, that the struggle itself ''is enough to fill a man's heart.''
Certainly, if Mr. Steel -- whose office is still in the basement of the David H. Koch Theater, despite his determination that City Opera will leave Lincoln Center -- feels beaten down by the fracases stemming from that decision, he does not show it. Though circumspect, he was eminently chipper in discussing the company's present and future. 
Feisty, even. He began by challenging my recent statement in The New York Times that the City Opera staff was dwindling, made after it was learned that two respected members of the music department would be leaving. Mr. Steel has eliminated the position of music director, which the conductor George Manahan had occupied since 1996. And the vocal coach Kevin Murphy, who has been director of music administration since 2008, will leave to join the faculty of Indiana University with his wife, the soprano Heidi Grant Murphy.
''The staff is robust,'' Mr. Steel said. ''We have great people on the team, and we're ready to go.'' Mr. Manahan, though he has no City Opera engagements for the coming season, will be a welcome guest conductor in future years, Mr. Steel emphasized, and Mr. Murphy will remain a casting adviser to the company.
Mr. Steel also took issue with repeated suggestions in The Times that the next season would consist of only four productions, those so far announced for February through May: Verdi's ''Traviata'' and Rufus Wainwright's ''Prima Donna,'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music; Mozart's ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' at John Jay College; and Telemann's ''Orpheus'' at El Museo del Barrio. There will be a fifth production, he insists, a Shakespearean opera in Central Park in collaboration with the Public Theater, though he acknowledges that it won't happen until late summer 2012, and he doesn't guarantee that it won't be counted as one of the five productions for the following season.
Finally, he disputed my comment that with only four or five productions a season, the once-busy company seemed to lack anything like momentum or critical mass.
''We are absolutely on the road to growth as soon as we have the money,'' he said. ''We expect that soon, but we have to stabilize. We will have critical mass.''
Although most companies do only 5 or 6 operas per season, he added, his ideal for City Opera is some 8 to 10 productions.
The former busyness, Mr. Steel is quick to point out, came at tremendous cost. And the company repeatedly failed to deal adequately with the inevitable deficits.
Fixed costs at Lincoln Center, he said, were $18 million a year. Fund-raising typically amounted to $14 million. So the company started with a gap of $4 million.
''The cost of doing nothing was astronomical, and it didn't buy you any performances,'' Mr. Steel said. Putting on a show would cost at least $1 million.
''It could be $2 million or $3 million,'' he added. ''You start with a $4 million problem and add at least a million for every show.''
Mr. Steel says that the company set records for fund-raising in each of the last two years -- first more than $15 million, then $18 million -- but that this was not nearly enough to offset the endemic problem. The move from Lincoln Center, he said, whatever it may mean to the company's prestige (little if anything, he thinks), ''cuts $10 million annually from the cost of standing still.''
So Mr. Steel doesn't deny that the company's reasons for leaving Lincoln Center are mainly economic. But with expert sleight of hand, he is able to find artistic benefits as well.
With a multiplicity of new halls, Mr. Steel said, ''we're serving composers, not architects.''
''Now we have the right operas in the right spaces,'' he added.
He is trying to do much the same in negotiations with the unions representing the company's choristers and orchestral players, who reasonably fear that many hours of work may be at stake, if not entire jobs.
''Negotiations are theater,'' Mr. Steel said. ''There's no doubt, we're asking for very real sacrifices. But the way the contracts are now structured can't continue.
''Item 1 in the contract proposal is a raise. But we want to pay people for work done. This is common practice in business, but it is seen as a radical part of the proposal.''
In terms of the way City Opera has traditionally operated, with a standing orchestra employed throughout its season, the proposal of contingent employment is indeed radical, whether necessary or not. And Mr. Steel's appeal to musical probity here, too, may strike some as specious. ''The size of the orchestra will be determined by the composer,'' he said, ''not by contracts. We're happy to hire the chorus and orchestra as now constituted as we now need them and to hire additional people to do some operas.''
Then again, maybe it is all theater.
As for Mr. Manahan's former position, Mr. Steel said: ''Doing without a music director is not our innovation. The Seattle Opera doesn't have a music director, and many orchestras in this country are now doing without one. It doesn't make sense for a five-opera season.''
''I have no desire to be a music director myself,'' said Mr. Steel, who is also a conductor. Nor, he added, does he have any desire to conduct at City Opera in the near future, though he does have ideas down the road that might be right up his line.
''In my role as a producer, I spend a lot of time in the future,'' Mr. Steel said, ''and it makes me happy to live there. But an important part of my job is returning to the present and leading people forward, and in one sense people are living in the past.
''I manage for the future. If I have to take tomatoes from here to there, I can live with that.''

HEADLINE: Strikers And Verizon Trade Barbs

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Ever since 45,000 workers began their strike against Verizon Communications on Sunday, their unions have repeatedly stressed one point: Verizon's push for concessions would ''destroy middle-class jobs'' and ''push workers out of the middle class.''
Verizon officials assert that this is largely a shrewd talking point aimed at wooing public support for the workers. The company insists that the striking employees are handsomely paid and will remain solidly in the middle class even if Verizon wins on some of the disputed issues, like getting the workers to pay at least $1,200 more a year toward health coverage. 
Throughout this first week of the walkout by the Communications Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, the sides have contradicted each other and talked past each other as they jockey to win public backing and rally their supporters.
For instance, union officials say Verizon's proposed health insurance changes would cost some workers $6,800 more each year, and its overall proposals would cost workers $20,000 on average each year. But Verizon's top spokesman called the $6,800 health assertion ''distorted'' and the $20,000 claim ''bogus.''
In the states stretching from Massachusetts to Virginia, where the unions are on strike, workers picketed on Friday at scores of company facilities, with the communications workers president, Larry Cohen, joining the picketing in Philadelphia. In addition to the health insurance changes, Verizon has called for a pension freeze, reduction of sick days and elimination of all job security provisions -- a proposal workers fear will lead to far more layoffs and outsourcing, especially of call center workers.
''The package of concessions they're seeking is so sweeping in terms of wages, benefits, pension, vacation and sick days that it would take what are good union jobs and push people into a very different economic situation,'' said Pam Galpern, a Verizon field technician in New York City for 12 years. ''We see this as a definite attack on the middle class, and there's no justification for it from a company that's so profitable.''
Verizon officials show little patience with union talk about imperiled middle-class workers, ''This is a well-worn negotiating and communications ploy -- it's not a statement of fact,'' said Peter Thonis, Verizon's chief spokesman.
Verizon says its unionized workers average $70,000 a year before overtime and $91,000 with overtime. But union officials say only a small percentage of workers earn that much with overtime, an amount they say would require hundreds of hours of it.
Company officials note that the average American worker earns $23 an hour, translating to $48,000 a year for a full-time worker. ''The striking workers earn considerably more than many unionized nurses and teachers,'' Mr. Thonis said. ''We're at the very top of our industry in terms of compensation.''
He said the strikers were part of a rarefied group who contributed nothing toward their health insurance premiums. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, just 1 percent of American workers pay nothing toward their family coverage premiums. The unions say the workers pay 7 percent of their health coverage through copayments and deductibles.
Doug Anderson, a Verizon field technician for 15 years, said he was barely in the middle class and would fall out of it if Verizon won concessions.
''What we make is just a living wage in the New York area,'' said Mr. Anderson, 53, a father of three who lives in Poughkeepsie. ''On what I earn, my family can't even afford to live where I work -- Westchester County. And on what we earn, it's hard to send a child through college.''
Warning that the strike might be a long one, Robert Master, a union spokesman, said the workers were angry because the company seemed intent on cutting compensation costs even though it had $22 billion in profits the last four years. But Verizon officials say that nearly all the striking employees work in its landline division, which faces intense competitive pressures. Its customer base and profit margins have shrunk over the last decade, they said.
Industry analysts estimate that the Verizon workers earn several dollars more an hour than workers at largely nonunion cable competitors like Cablevision and Time Warner.
Roger Entner, founder of Recon Analytics, a telecommunication research firm in Dedham, Mass., said Verizon's higher costs were making it harder to compete. ''Verizon often charges $110 for a FiOS package,'' including television, Internet and voice, he said, ''while some of its nonunion cable competitors have a $50 package.''
Gary Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University, sees several anomalies in this showdown.
''Verizon is asking for deep concessions, but it's not offering any quid pro quo, such as more job security,'' he said. ''It even wants to eliminate all job security. Another anomaly is the unions are seeking to defend a benefit that is not enjoyed by many workers in the United States. The unions are insisting on something -- not contributing anything toward health care premiums -- that they're almost embarrassed to say they're insisting on.''
Many industry analysts say they doubt that Verizon will get most of the dozens of concessions it is seeking. Many predict that the two sides will ultimately reach a deal resembling the ones that the landline division of a rival, AT&T, reached with the communications workers -- in which the union workers have had to start to contribute toward their premiums.
Verizon officials say they want the workers to pay $1,200 to $3,000 annually in premiums, depending on the plan, with an average of $1,450. But Candice Johnson, a communications workers spokeswoman, said many workers might have to pay $6,800 more toward health coverage a year, including premiums and higher deductibles. Mr. Thonis said very few workers would ever reach that level.
Ms. Johnson said the pension freeze would mean far lower pensions in retirement, pressuring many workers to start setting aside several thousand dollars a year to build a nest egg. But Mr. Thonis said that under an enriched 401(k) program the company would match 6 to 9 percent of each worker's pay.
The two sides held negotiations on Friday in Rye, N.Y., and Philadelphia, even as each side filed changes with the National Labor Relation Board, accusing the other side of dragging its feet by not bargaining in good faith.

HEADLINE: Herman Cain Is First at the Fair

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- The procession of presidential candidates through the Iowa State Fair started Friday morning with Herman Cain, who declared that he was running because of a ''deficiency of leadership'' in Washington. 
Mr. Cain, a former chief executive of Godfather's Pizza who is a long shot to win the Republican nomination, said he was often told that he did not understand how Washington works.
''Yes, I do,'' he said. ''It doesn't!''
At the fair, Mr. Cain pledged to reduce tax rates within his first 90 days in the White House. That, he said, is how the country could ''put fuel in the engine'' and create economic growth.
''Why am I running for president? Like I said, it's for the children and the grandchildren,'' Mr. Cain said, relating how he had survived a bout with cancer.
''I happen to believe that God wanted me to stay here so I could try and make a difference,'' Mr. Cain said. MICHAEL D. SHEAR

HEADLINE: Family Happiness And the Overbooked Child

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
I LIVE in an area where most parents would rather cut back on indulgences for themselves than stop paying for their children's activities.
Music lessons, gymnastics, horseback riding, tutoring, summer-long residential camps, sports teams -- the list goes on and on. Often, so do the costs.
And even if the money is not there, some parents find a way. I know people who have borrowed from family, used home equity accounts and run up their credit cards to pay for all the stuff they believe their children just cannot miss.
''The experiences we thought kids had to have before high school has moved down to junior high and now elementary,'' said William Doherty, a professor of family studies and director of the marriage and family therapy program at the University of Minnesota. ''Soon, we'll be talking about leadership opportunities for toddlers.'' 
To come clean, my children through the years have taken ice skating, tennis, violin and yes, even tae kwon do (of which the only residue now seems to be lots of colored belts around the house). Some lessons lasted a few months, some for years.
And what is wrong with that? Maybe we know that some parents go overboard on extracurricular activities, but aren't these important for their children's future success?
Somehow, not offering our children every possible opportunity ''feels like bad parenting,'' said Wendy Mogel, a clinical psychologist and author of ''The Blessing of a B Minus,'' (Scribner, 2010).
But in an effort to give their children everything, some parents end up not just depleting financial resources, but also their own emotional energy.
''A lot of parents are exhausted by their own overparenting,'' said Bryan Caplan, an economics professor at George Mason University. ''They make so many sacrifices and are so stressed out by driving around so much that they explode at kids for changing the radio station.''
But isn't it worth it for the ultimate good of our children? Not necessarily. Some of the most interesting insights into this question come not from psychologists, but economists.
''It's easy to take a look at the more successful kids and assume that all the activities are why they are more successful,'' Professor Caplan said. But research doesn't bear that out.
On a recent National Public Radio program, Steven D. Levitt, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago, said he and another economist could find no evidence that that sort of parental choices could be correlated at all with academic success.
''And my guess is,'' he went on, ''that when it comes to the happiness of kids, that kind of cramming has got to be negatively correlated. Being rushed from one event to the other is just not the way most kids want to live their lives, at least not my kid.'' Professor Levitt was also co-author of the New York Times blog Freakonomics.
All right, the economists are largely talking about academic success. But I would wager that most parents believe these experiences are not just for good grades, or are the key to the right college, but are also for the opportunities they give children.
Most parents know that an infinitesimal number of children will go on to be world class in any field. But maybe those pricey golf lessons will earn your son a place on the high school team. Or the acting classes will propel your daughter into the lead in the school play.
And what parent doesn't dream that piano lessons will instill a lifelong love of playing, even if it is only in the living room?
The trouble is, many of us have bought into the idea that every child has a ''hidden talent,'' Professor Doherty said, and that we are failing our children if we don't do everything possible to bring it to light.
There are certainly good reasons to offer our children some of these experiences, but there are more negative ones as well, if we rely on them to make us feel like good parents, or if we think that arming them with a myriad of skills can guarantee their later success in life.
The desire to offer every conceivable opportunity is a ''displaced fear about the collapse of the future,'' Dr. Mogel said.
The reality is that failing to give your child ballet lessons at age 6 probably has not deprived her of a career as a prima ballerina.
And even if a child is passionate about something, that doesn't mean you have to go all out, ''if it's to the detriment of the parent's sanity or a connected family life,'' Professor Doherty said.
Or to one's finances.
''Parents can say no to material things, but it's very hard to do that for what we call opportunities,'' said Barbara Dafoe Whitehead, director of the John Templeton Center for Thrift and Generosity at the nonprofit Institute for American Values. ''Enrichment seems sacred and inviolable, and mentally we put those ideas in a different part of the head.
''Kids have to understand there are limits to what a parent can do for them, but it's very, very difficult to say, 'I'm sorry, we can't afford it,' '' she added.
My friend Rachel decided to stop private music lessons for her son and daughter after about two years.
''At first I felt like I was cheating them,'' she said. ''I felt very strongly that music was a part of their education and it wasn't offered deeply enough at school.''
But the price tag -- around $1,000 a semester for each -- was becoming too much of a burden. And her children were fine with it; they are continuing to play their instruments in school.
''I gave them the opportunity to get the music bug and they didn't,'' Rachel said. ''I have to have the confidence that it's the right thing to do. And I'm almost glad we have to make these decisions based on finances. Otherwise, if you can give your kids everything, they're left swimming in a pool of activities without necessarily any effort or desire for them.''
That does not mean that some stimulating activities outside school are not important, but equally critical is a warm and well-connected family life, Professor Doherty said.
''Sometimes for the sake of child and family balance, you have to say no to intensive activity,'' he said. That can mean that if your child likes soccer, she can play on the recreational soccer team but not on the more time-consuming travel team, he added.
And we have to move away from the idea that if we do not start children early, they will not reach their full potential. After all, we know the human brain doesn't fully mature until around 25, Professor Doherty said.
So why the rush? In some cases, it's hard for children to join sports teams at 12 if every other child has been playing since, say, age 5. But many of us will pick up skills and, yes, even passions, well into our adult years that never manifested themselves when we were younger.
The 24-year-old daughter of Dr. Mogel, the psychologist, is now a competitive roller derby skater and taking graduate studies in industrial labor relations.
''If you had said she'd be involved in either of those things when she was younger, I would never have believed it,'' Dr. Mogel said. ''We have this idea that we have to capture passion because it's so fleeting.'' But it's not.
And if we do not cut back on all the intensive activity, we all may find ourselves seeking costly expertise in another area -- the therapist's office.

HEADLINE: Societe Generale Rises as a Global Worry

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and LIZ ALDERMAN; Eric Dash, Nelson Schwartz and Jack Ewing contributed reporting..

 BODY:
It's a bank that hasn't been much on Wall Street's radar since the days of the A.I.G. bailout.
But Societe Generale, France's third-biggest bank, has been stirring financial markets once again on concerns about its big holdings of the debt of shaky European neighbors like Greece.
Although its shares closed slightly up on Friday, Societe Generale's stock has fallen more than 40 percent since mid-July and helped pull European bank stocks down earlier in the week. That volatility is a big reason that France on Thursday night imposed a temporary 15-day ban on short-selling -- negative bets -- against financial and insurance company stocks. 
Why does Societe Generale matter?
Jitters about the bank's stability reverberate in New York and around the world because, among other things, Societe Generale is one of the biggest global players in equity derivatives -- financial instruments meant to protect investors against price plunges in stocks. It does business regularly with the likes of Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Deutsche Bank.
''They have significant outstanding derivative exposures, which makes them systemically important,'' said Kian Abouhossein, an analyst covering European banks for JPMorgan Chase. ''They are important to the financial system, not just in the U.S. or Europe, but globally.''
What's more, Societe Generale has something of a history. It achieved notoriety during the last financial crisis when a rogue trader for the bank, Jerome Kerviel, lost his employer 4.9 billion euros, or $6.7 billion.
Societe Generale may be even better remembered for its disastrous entanglement of derivatives contracts with the giant insurer American International Group.
The A.I.G. contracts protected Societe Generale from its large stake in troubled American mortgage securities -- but only after the United States government bailed out A.I.G. in 2008 and agreed to pay companies like Societe Generale 100 cents on the dollar. When Societe Generale was eventually revealed to be one of the largest recipients of the A.I.G. bailout funds, some critics questioned why a French bank was allowed to cart home $11.9 billion in American government money.
The French government now, as it did back then, is playing a big role in trying to calm markets and protect Societe Generale. Investors' main fear is that the company's exposure to Greece -- it even owns the majority of a Greek bank -- and other troubled European countries might cause a panic that drives away its trading partners and disrupts the derivatives market.
Some investors even worry that Societe Generale's holdings of French government bonds might become a problem if ratings agencies downgrade France's sovereign debt. So far, though, the ratings agencies have been nearly as loud in their denials that they plan such a downgrade as the French government and Societe Generale's executives have been vociferous in insisting that the bank is on solid footing.
In any case, the rumor-driven run on Societe Generale is already costing the company money. It has been forced to pay significantly more than some of its sturdier European banking peers to borrow, according to several market participants.
Analysts point out that Societe Generale has a strong balance sheet, but they say that panic in the markets can undermine even strong financials.
Mr. Abouhossein, for one, says he thinks the market fear is overblown -- as is the risk to Societe Generale, even if it were forced to take write-downs on the debt of other troubled euro countries, like Italy and Spain.
''French banks can always borrow money from the European Central Bank,'' he said.
In fact, many European banks were doing just that this week. On Wednesday, commercial banks' requests for short-term loans from the central bank spiked to a three-month high.
Societe Generale officials have spent much of the week arguing that the market's fears were unfounded. On Thursday, the bank's chief executive, Frederic Oudea, described rumors that Societe Generale was having trouble raising money as ''fantasy.''
And in fact, on Thursday Societe Generale was able to raise $2 billion in overnight money -- although it reportedly paid higher interest than a more stable European bank like Barclays or Rabobank would have had to. The bank is also still lending out money in the overnight market, which is typically interpreted as a sign of strength.
Societe Generale's direct exposure to Greece is not nearly as large as the exposure it had to the American housing market going into the panic of 2008. Nonetheless, it has been unnerving investors with write-downs like the 268 million euro charge on its Greek holdings the bank announced early this month.
Just as many other large European institutions did, Societe Generale bought into sovereign debt at a time when those purchases looked mostly risk-free.
It amassed about 18.2 billion euros of exposure to Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain -- almost as large as the bank's 19.2 billion euros in holdings of French debt, according to the European Banking Authority. The sovereign debt of most of those other countries has recently been downgraded, hitting the bank's portfolio.
But analysts say Societe Generale, like other European banks, can count on the support of regulators.
In the recent agreement for the latest Greek bailout, Societe Generale was among the banks that agreed to forgive about one-fifth of the value of the country's debt. As part of that deal, a pan-European fund is supposed to make money available to help banks that may need assistance covering their losses on Greece -- although each of the 17 euro zone nations' governments must still vote on whether to finance the bailout fund.
Societe Generale, in other words, may be as solid -- or not -- as the euro union itself.
''I don't think the euro is in danger,'' Mr. Oudea, Societe Generale's chief executive, said Thursday. ''The governments are very attached to the single currency and lucid about the efforts that must be made.''

HEADLINE: Bond Brush Fires Spreading in Europe

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
HOW many fires can one central bank deal with?
The European Central Bank this week began to buy Spanish and Italian government bonds, and yields on such bonds immediately fell by more than a percentage point. But market pressure shifted immediately to France. 
For France, the rise in yields must have come as a shock. At the end of last week, Standard & Poor's had gone out of its way to declare that the country deserved a Triple-A rating, and this was at the same time it was taking that rating away from the United States.
As soon as the French bond yields began to rise, rumors appeared that major French banks might be in trouble because of their holdings of government, or sovereign, debt. The banks insisted they were fine.
The accompanying charts show the trend in yield spreads between 10-year government bonds issued by Germany, by far the largest and strongest country in the euro zone, and the four other largest countries that share the common currency.
The most recent round of market worry appeared to begin on July 22, as Europe agreed on terms for the latest loans to Greece. That agreement was aimed at persuading banks that owned Greek bonds to share in the pain, and the yield spreads on Spanish and Italian bonds promptly began to rise, as speculators sold bonds issued by those countries.
At an emergency meeting on Sunday, the European Central Bank governing board reached agreement to allow purchases of bonds from those two countries. When those purchases began on Monday, yield spreads relative to Germany declined from the peaks of the previous week. But it appears that some of the speculation shifted, and France came up as a possible target, and its spread began to widen. The S.& P. report on the United States had called attention to the fact that France's debt, as a percentage of gross domestic product, was larger than that of the United States.
The difference between French and German yields on 10-year bonds rose to almost a full percentage point. That is not close to the spreads between German bonds and those of Italy or Spain, but it is the largest spread for France since the euro was established in 1999.
But the Netherlands, whose bonds had traded at wider spreads than France's during the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, appeared to be unaffected by speculation this week.
The first set of charts shows the changes in spreads since July 22, while the second set of charts shows the long-term trend beginning in 1994.
During the mid-1990s, anticipation of the establishment of the euro led spreads to collapse. Previously, countries like Italy had often had to pay substantially more to borrow, a fact that reflected fears of currency devaluation. With a common currency, and no provision for a country to ever leave the euro, it appeared that there was no reason for yields to be very different.
But when the financial crisis struck, bond investors began to differentiate more between countries, a trend that accelerated when first Greece and then Ireland and Portugal had to seek European help. The latest Greek deal provided that bondholders would be asked to take some losses, a fact that emphasized the risk of default to investors in other countries' bonds.

But yields on French bonds began rising, leaving the difference between French and German rates -- the spread -- at the highest level since the euro came into existence in 1999. Spreads on Dutch bonds have moved much less. (Source: Bloomberg)

HEADLINE: All the Ways That Stocks Churn Your Stomach

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
If the stock market is a reflection of the stew of our emotions, it's pretty clear that nobody knew how to feel this week.
Sure, a 4 percent swing in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index reflects some sort of investor conviction. But four days in a row of violent up-and-down movements? The weeklong chart looks like the readout of a lie detector test run amok.
The default advice at times like these is to remain calm. But I'd be lying if I didn't admit that I was also grappling with every emotion along the fight-flight-freeze continuum. The most harrowing feeling is the sense of deja vu, given the rumors of trouble in European banks and various efforts to ban short-selling. It all feels too much like the fall of 2008, and nobody wants to go back to the way they felt in the year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
So like you, I imagine, I wanted to buy, and I wanted to sell, sometimes on the same day. And I felt rage toward various authority figures. Another recession is a real possibility. And government debt isn't just having its own impact on stocks worldwide; it's wreaking havoc on our confidence in our country and our basic sense of security. 
These emotions aren't particularly constructive in the long term, since they can be paralyzing or lead us to make hair-trigger decisions. And if we don't stop to confront and untangle these feelings, they can easily lead us astray. So this weekend, I'd encourage you to see if any of the visceral reactions I describe below sound anything like your own internal conversations. Then, dig into them -- and deploy some countermeasures.
IGNORANCE Given that the stock market seems to be sending a message of utter confusion, there is no shame in admitting that you do not understand what is happening.
The relentless chatter for days on end only compounds the problem. ''People do not know what all of these economic terms mean,'' said Kenneth Doyle, a psychologist and former financial planner who is now a professor at the University of Minnesota. ''But they do know the fear in the voice of commentators, and everything looks dismal.''
When the background noise gets too aggravating, turn it off and remind yourself what you do know. After all, the last dozen years have actually hammered home a number of basic personal finance principles.
In 2000, we learned an important lesson about portfolio diversification when technology stocks collapsed. When Enron declared bankruptcy, it became clear that we should not make long-term investments with our life savings in company stock if we could possibly avoid it. And in the last five years, it's become painfully clear that housing prices do not go up forever. Small down payments, meanwhile, can leave you stuck with a bad mortgage in a home that is worth less than the balance of your loan.
This time, one lesson is already clear, even if the precise implications are not. Governments at all levels cannot pay for the services we once believed that we would have coming to us forever. In the future, many of us we will get less financial help in old age, spend more of our savings to make up the difference and pay more in taxes for the privilege.
My plan is to put more money away, when I can, in savings accounts that are shielded from taxes or free from them entirely, like 529 college savings plans and Roth individual retirement accounts, and hope that the tax rules don't somehow change midstream.
FEAR If you're scared, allow yourself to imagine the worst possible outcome. For most of us, it's running out of money. So before you make any big changes to your portfolio, follow this fear to its logical conclusion. What would have to happen for you to be truly penniless?
First, your investments would need to go to zero or be utterly ravaged by inflation. Social Security would have to cease to exist. Medicare would no longer pay for much, if anything. Medicaid would no longer pay for nursing home care for people without any other assets. And your family and friends would be unwilling to take you in or pitch in to help.
Once you realize how unlikely this combination is, call a timeout on any big decisions and let your rational mind settle back in. ''Put some distance between impulse and action,'' said Brad Klontz, a psychologist and consultant specializing in financial matters. He adds that this is particularly important for men, who tend to react more emotionally than women.
Simple things like intense exercise can help. Or, focus on a couple of financial tasks that you can control, like updating a will or crossing something else off that nagging list of financial to-dos.
GUILT Sometimes the most damaging feelings are less about your own financial standing and more about how you've failed or disappointed others.
Perhaps you couldn't persuade your parents to scale back their stock exposure. Or you were too aggressive yourself with investing any college savings money you managed to put aside and are worried about saddling your child with student loan debt.
This is the worst kind of myopia, though. You are more than the sum of your family's stock returns, and their returns are about much more than stocks.
Elderly relatives, for instance, will probably not see the same cuts to Social Security and Medicare that you will. And hopefully they also have at least some bonds or other holdings they can call on while waiting for stocks to recover. If they have a home that's at least partly paid off, a reverse mortgage can help as a last resort measure, too. You can explain all of that and help them sort through it.
If you are still employed, your biggest asset is probably your future income stream. If you haven't lost your job this week, then you still have that going for you and can put it to work helping your children when (and if) they truly need it.
BRAVADO If none of the above helps, it's easy to fall prey to the damaging tendency to take drastic action.
Carl Richards, whose posts on our Bucks blog sum up complex emotions in deceptively simple sketches, refers to this as the need to do something heroic.
Kathleen Gurney, chief executive of the Financial Psychology Corporation, calls it the ''manic response'' that therapists look for and try to counteract. It's the idea that going all in on gold will protect you, or that your Apple stock will, or foreign currencies or something else.
This sort of single-minded response has made some people rich over the years and allowed others to lead a worry-free retirement if they timed the markets right and died within a couple of decades.
But the risk of being wrong and living long is just too high for most people to make big bets like that today.
If you still feel the need to do something, consider this self-assessment test from Ken French, a Tuck School of Business professor and stock market expert, who offers it as a frame of reference and not as a prediction of short-term performance.
''Ask yourself how you are different from the market,'' he said. ''If you think you are particularly risk-averse relative to everyone else, then it makes perfect sense for you to sell.'' Just don't get in and repeat the cycle when things look as if they are turning up again.
''If you think you are more risk-tolerant, then maybe this is an opportunity for you to buy,'' he added, noting that the market may pay a small premium to people willing to endure the gyrations. ''If you're not averse to that volatility, you are getting a higher expected return for a modest psychological burden.''

HEADLINE: The Market's Volatility

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Aug. 12 front-page article about market swings (''It Zigs, It Zags: Market Rises 4% After Down Day'') cites alternating days of collapsing prices and rising prices. It seems likely that some clever traders with high-speed computers are able to multiply the volatility with huge amounts of money and additional leverage by buying long and short on alternate days. By reinforcing the volatility they can produce huge returns for themselves. 
This is not a free-market activity to be greatly admired. We ought to be able to regulate it.

HEADLINE: For Theater Lovers, a City Is the Stage, and a Purple Cow Is a Prop

BYLINE: By STEVEN McELROY

 BODY:
EDINBURGH -- Julian Sands stands alone onstage at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, dressed in an impeccably tailored suit that seems all the more natty in contrast to the tattered copy of ''Various Voices,'' a compilation of the writings of the playwright Harold Pinter, that he clutches. The book is bursting with Post-it notes. Mr. Sands spends about an hour there, recounting anecdotes about his personal experiences working with Pinter, the Nobel Laureate, who died in 2008.
On another stage the former Soft Cell vocalist Marc Almond looks wan and wears all black as he sings, in a sometimes quavering voice, an hourlong song cycle on death that is ostensibly about a man alone during the London plague of 1665, but could be about AIDS or any disease that frightens the uninfected. This is ''Ten Plagues,'' with a libretto by the English playwright Mark Ravenhill and music by Conor Mitchell.
On yet another stage, open-faced teenagers from Glasgow, collectively known as Junction 25, haltingly share their stories. These folks, not yet old enough to have experienced romantic love -- let alone to know of the heyday of Mr. Sands, Mr. Almond or Pinter, for that matter -- struggle to understand it nonetheless in ''I Hope My Heart Goes First.'' 
As they describe young love -- what it's like, say, to learn to ask another person out -- they ponder how a broken heart might feel. At moments they burst tomatoes in their hands to signify the messiness of heartbreak as they imagine it to be.
As usual, the Edinburgh Fringe is a gigantic, eclectic affair. With theatrical offerings representing about 30 percent of the overall Fringe program this year (a whopping 2,542 events), options are varied, to say the least. For a theater lover it is possible to mill around this huge smorgasbord for more than a week and not feel filled up.
Navigating the festival, which runs through Aug. 29, is difficult, and even with meticulous organization, you cannot hit every high point. There are themes, if that's your thing; solo shows (many, many, many); site-specific productions; Shakespeare adaptations; star-driven vehicles. (Besides Mr. Sands's recollections of Pinter in a piece directed by John Malkovich, there's also Simon Callow drawing crowds for his portrayal of a transgender woman in ''Tuesday at Tescos.'' )
Two plays commemorate the Triangle Waist Company factory fire of 1911, and four are inspired by the terrorist attacks of 9/11, in anticipation of the 10-year anniversary of that tragedy.
One, ''Generation 9/11: So Far/So Close,'' by Chris Wolfe, looks at the impact of the attacks outside of New York City. ''I knew I was watching history unfold,'' Mr. Wolfe said after a performance on a rainy afternoon. He was recalling Sept. 11, 2001, when he was 21 and a student at the University of California, Irvine, and watched the World Trade Center crumble on television.
Some New Yorkers can be proprietary about the events of that day, and some who are here, Mr. Wolfe said, have looked at him suspiciously on the street when he has pitched his show to passersby and has told them he is from California. But he interviewed more than 150 people to create ''Generation 9/11,'' and at one moment, when he takes on the character of a Seattle driver who flinches when a plane passes overhead, he helps to clarify how that day affected Americans far from the towers themselves.
Many of the hottest Fringe shows, like ''Ten Plagues,'' are presented by the Traverse, a respected year-round institution devoted to new writing. Dominic Hill, the Traverse's outgoing artistic director (he will take on the same title at the Citizens Theater in Glasgow this fall), acknowledged in a recent conversation that the Traverse occupies a unique position within the Fringe.
''I think it is crucial that we preserve the position of the writer,'' he said, describing the theater's mission. A lot of the festival offerings, to be sure, are ''less text-based,'' as he put it.
He was being diplomatic; he loved the Fringe when he was younger but now, well, he isn't up for an all-night event that is inspired by ''Medea,'' or similar fare, he said.
The Traverse is hardly risk-averse: A presentation there of the National Theater of Scotland's production of Zinnie Harris's epic drama ''The Wheel,'' about a woman who embarks on a lonely journey through a world at war to help an abandoned child, is evidence enough of that. So is ''Mission Drift,'' a brash look at American capitalism, set to some great rock 'n' roll, by the New York company the Team.
And notable playwrights and their more traditional plays are dotted throughout the Fringe program. They include David Harrower (''Blackbird''), whose drama ''A Slow Air'' is about an estranged Scottish brother and sister (played by actual siblings) on the verge of making peace; and David Greig, whose play ''The Strange Undoing of Prudencia Hart,'' a poetic, musical and fantastical tale about a stuffy female academic who meets the Devil one evening, has been one of the most popular shows in town.
Think of the Fringe as a circus for theater nerds, though, and it's more likely that the giant purple cow lying on its back on the grounds of Edinburgh University might come to mind.
The area around that cow, known as the Udderbelly Pasture, is one of the places where the entertainment company Underbelly presents shows. Beneath that cow is a 410-seat temporary theater and a private bar called the Abattoir.
Underbelly is one of several production companies -- Pleasance, Assembly and Gilded Balloon are some of the other big ones -- that provide pop-up theater spaces, publicity and more for performing artists here. These companies are a key part of the festival's structure, since the Fringe doesn't have a curator.
''If you want to come up with your one-man 'Macbeth' in drag, you can do it,'' explained Ed Bartlam, who directs Underbelly with Charlie Wood.
Underbelly chooses carefully what goes under its name. This summer that includes ''Dry Ice,'' a solo show about strip clubs, written and performed by Sabrina Mahfouz and directed by David Schwimmer of ''Friends'' fame, and ''Free Run,'' a parkour show. The company has grown enormously in a dozen years, from its four shows at the 2000 Fringe to well over 100 this year.
Last summer Underbelly productions sold almost 300,000 tickets, Mr. Bartlam said. And yet, Mr. Wood said, ''we are the new kids on the block at 12.''
The Fringe began in 1947, when a small group of artists was closed out of the more renowned Edinburgh International Festival and decided to do its own thing on the sidelines, hoping to siphon audiences. Now it's a central part of what makes Edinburgh a huge late-summer cultural attraction, along with the other arts festival and one devoted to books. The festivals pumped about $:245 million (almost $400 million) into the city's economy in 2010, according to the Edinburgh Festivals Impact Study, released in May; 142 million of those pounds (about $230 million) came from the Fringe festival.
Kath Mainland, the chief executive of Festival Fringe Society, said the city's embrace of the Fringe is one of the main things that make it unusual and successful. The festival is run as a nonprofit, and the hope is just to break even each year, Ms. Mainland said.
(It did a bit better than break even last year: Expenses were just over $:2.5 million, and earnings were over $:2.8 million.)
Many of the artists involved aren't terribly concerned with making money, either. But everyone wants an audience and the exposure that might come with it. That's what kept Jack Britton, a boyish and enthusiastic part-time stand-up comic, handing out fliers in the rain for ''Gagging for Attention,'' which he performs with several other comedians.
''If you just give them a flier and walk away, that's a bit dodgy,'' said Mr. Britton, a student at De Montfort University in Leicester, explaining his technique. ''But if you give someone a flier and talk to them and explain the details of your show, then it's a lot easier.''
Is shilling in the rain worth the effort? ''I generally do see people that I've fliered at our show,'' Mr. Britton said. ''We've got an 80-seater or so. On the first day we sold 19, the second day we sold 19, and yesterday we sold out.''

HEADLINE: The Debt Supercommittee

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''6 Republicans Named to Congressional Committee to Reduce the Deficit'' (news article, Aug. 11): 
Since all six of the Republican appointees to the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction have pledged to Grover Norquist not to raise taxes under any circumstances, the only agreement on solving the nation's debt crisis that can emerge from the committee will necessarily be the kind of ''compromise'' that emerged from Congress's last effort: all cuts and no revenues.
Look for this stalemate to continue until the American public itself has a chance to vote its preferences. Perhaps Democrats running for election next year might want to pledge their own allegiance to a solution of the debt crisis that includes a balance of revenues and cuts, the approach favored by a majority of Americans.

HEADLINE: 'A Car Guy' Prepares to Choose a Leader for a Troubled Mass-Transit Agency

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Thomas Kaplan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo proudly calls himself ''a car guy, and a motorcycle guy, and a boat guy.'' One thing he is not, however, is a subway guy.
A product of the muscle car culture of suburban Queens, Mr. Cuomo is a chassis-and-wax aficionado who likes to tinker with camshafts and keeps a framed photograph of his sky blue Corvette on his desk. Asked this week if he could recall his last trip on the New York City subway, the governor, now a resident of Westchester County, paused a moment, his lips pursed. ''Um, it would have been during the campaign,'' he said, referring to the race for governor last year, before quickly shifting gears to another reporter's question.
Now, the future of New York's ailing transportation system, its subways, buses and trains depended on by millions, rests in his hands. In what many consider the most critical appointment of his tenure thus far, Mr. Cuomo must soon name a new leader of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority as it confronts a $9 billion budget shortfall and the struggles of the subway system to avoid backsliding to its darker days. 
Mass transit has not been a political passion for the governor. In the hundreds of policy papers released by his campaign last year, only four referred to the transportation authority. As a candidate, Mr. Cuomo repeated a long-discredited rumor about the agency's shady accounting; he was later criticized for a news conference in which he offered little substantive comment on how to fix the authority's finances.
And unlike other New York politicians who like to play straphanger, Mr. Cuomo has not made much room for mass transit in his own life. ''I've known Andrew for 40 years, but I never saw him on the subway,'' said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant.
A spokesman for Mr. Cuomo, Josh Vlasto, says that the governor is well aware of mass transit's importance to cities, commuters and the state economy, and that he rode the rails as a young man, while working at the Manhattan district attorney's office and at a nonprofit organization he founded. Transportation, Mr. Vlasto says, is now near the top of the governor's agenda, and Mr. Cuomo can draw from his experience in Washington as secretary of housing and urban development, where he confronted other big-city issues.
Last week, Mr. Cuomo earned praise from transit and civic groups for the panel he created to guide his search for a new chairman and chief executive for the authority. The committee, whose first meeting is Tuesday, includes a who's-who of municipal lions like Richard Ravitch, credited with resurrecting the subway system in the 1980s, and riders' advocates like Gene Russianoff, a longtime straphangers' ally.
Supporters of Mr. Cuomo say that personal experience is not necessarily a requirement for a governor to ably take charge of a difficult public authority.
''He is going to choose the person responsible for the prisons,'' said William J. Stern, who worked alongside Mr. Cuomo on the 1982 campaign of his father, former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. ''Does that mean you have to work in the prison system, or have been a prisoner?''
William Henderson, executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee, a transit advocacy group, said Mr. Cuomo had made shrewd choices in selecting his advisers.
''If you don't have the background in it, you probably have to get the advice, and he's done a pretty good job of that with the committee he's put together,'' Mr. Henderson said. ''Dick Ravitch is not going to tell you what you want to hear. He is going to tell you what he thinks is right.''
Public transit has suddenly demanded the governor's attention because the authority's chairman, Jay H. Walder, abruptly announced last month that he would resign in October, after less than two years on the job.
Some observers see parallels with the governor's father, who during his first term had to replace Mr. Ravitch after he resigned. He chose Robert R. Kiley, who became another of the most celebrated chairmen in the agency's history. Recalling his relations with the governor during his seven-year tenure, Mr. Kiley said in an interview: ''I never felt once I got in place that I had anything but cooperation.''
Still, the current governor's lack of personal time with the subway sets him apart from other New York politicians. As a visually impaired child in Harlem, the future governor David A. Paterson learned to navigate the labyrinthine underground by listening to conductors' announcements. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch was known for his impromptu trips aboard the trains to hear the gripes and grumbles of riders.
There is some evidence that, growing up in Hollis, Queens, about a mile from the nearest subway line, Mr. Cuomo sometimes opted for an entirely different mode of transport.
George Haggerty Jr., whose father owned the B&G gas station where the young governor spent hours fiddling with engines and pumping gas, said in an interview that Mr. Cuomo commuted down a steep hill to the business.
''I can remember,'' Mr. Haggerty said, ''him coming in on a bicycle.''

HEADLINE: Qaeda Trying to Harness Toxin For Bombs, U.S. Officials Fear

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT and THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- American counterterrorism officials are increasingly concerned that the most dangerous regional arm of Al Qaeda is trying to produce the lethal poison ricin, to be packed around small explosives for attacks against the United States.
For more than a year, according to classified intelligence reports, Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen has been making efforts to acquire large quantities of castor beans, which are required to produce ricin, a white, powdery toxin that is so deadly that just a speck can kill if it is inhaled or reaches the bloodstream.
Intelligence officials say they have collected evidence that Qaeda operatives are trying to move castor beans and processing agents to a hideaway in Shabwa Province, in one of Yemen's rugged tribal areas controlled by insurgents. The officials say the evidence points to efforts to secretly concoct batches of the poison, pack them around small explosives, and then try to explode them in contained spaces, like a shopping mall, an airport or a subway station.
President Obama and his top national security aides were first briefed on the threat last year and have received periodic updates since then, top aides said. Senior American officials say there is no indication that a ricin attack is imminent, and some experts say the Qaeda affiliate is still struggling with how to deploy ricin as an effective weapon. 
These officials also note that ricin's utility as a weapon is limited because the substance loses its potency in dry, sunny conditions, and unlike many nerve agents, it is not easily absorbed through the skin. Yemen is a hot, dry country, posing an additional challenge to militants trying to produce ricin there.
But senior American officials say they are tracking the possibility of a threat very closely, given the Yemeni affiliate's proven ability to devise plots, including some thwarted only at the last minute: a bomb sewn into the underwear of a Nigerian man aboard a commercial jetliner to Detroit in December 2009, and printer cartridges packed with powerful explosives in cargo bound for Chicago 10 months later.
''The potential threat of weapons of mass destruction, likely in a simpler form than what people might imagine but still a form that would have a significant psychological impact, from Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula in Yemen, is very, very real,'' Michael E. Leiter, who retired recently as director of the National Counterterrorism Center, said at a security conference last month. ''It's not hard to develop ricin.''
A range of administration officials have stated that the threat of a major attack from Al Qaeda's main leadership in Pakistan has waned after Osama bin Laden's death in May, on top of the Central Intelligence Agency's increasing drone assaults on Qaeda targets in Pakistan's tribal areas over the past three years.
But the continuing concern over a ricin plot underscores the menace that regional Qaeda affiliates, especially Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, now pose to the United States and American interests overseas.
''That line of threat has never abated,'' said a senior American official, who referred to the terrorist group by its initials. ''That's been taken seriously by this government. What we know about A.Q.A.P. is that they do what they say.''
Al Qaeda's arm in Yemen has openly discussed deploying ricin and other deadly poisons against the United States. ''Brothers with less experience in the fields of microbiology or chemistry, as long as they possess basic scientific knowledge, would be able to develop other poisons such as ricin or cyanide,'' the organization posted to its online English-language journal, Inspire, last fall, in an article titled ''Tips for Our Brothers in the United States of America.''
Senior administration officials say ricin is among the threats focused on by a secret government task force created after the printer-cartridge plot. The task force is working closely with Saudi intelligence officials and the remnants of Yemen's intelligence agencies, and it is using information gleaned from the shipboard interrogation of a Somali terrorist leader with ties to the Yemeni branch of Al Qaeda, who was captured by Navy Seal commandos in April.
The intelligence reports indicating ricin plots by Al Qaeda's Yemeni affiliate were first uncovered during reporting for a book, ''Counterstrike: The Untold Story of America's Secret Campaign Against Al Qaeda.'' It will be published next week by Times Books, an imprint of Henry Holt & Company.
American officials now say that Al Qaeda's most direct threat to the United States comes from the Yemeni affiliate. These officials have also expressed growing alarm at the way the affiliate is capitalizing on the virtual collapse of Yemen's government to widen its area of control inside the country, and is strengthening its operational ties to the Shabab, the Islamic militancy in Somalia, to exploit the chaos in both countries.
''It continues to demonstrate its growing ambitions and strong desire to carry out attacks outside its region,'' Daniel Benjamin, the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, said in a speech last month, referring to Al Qaeda's Yemeni branch.
The affiliate has also become a magnet for terrorists fleeing the increasing pressure from drone strikes in Pakistan, and is recruiting specialists in bomb-making and other skills. ''These guys have got some notoriety,'' said a senior United States official who follows Al Qaeda and its affiliates closely. ''They have a natural, charismatic attraction value for people who want to be jihadists and plot against the West.''
''A.Q.A.P.'s senior leaders are a lot like an organization that's largely a brain that exists on its own and has to recruit its arms and legs to actually execute things,'' the official continued.
Largely because of the Americans in the Yemeni affiliate's top leadership, including Anwar al-Awlaki, a cleric born in New Mexico who is in hiding in Yemen, American counterterrorism and intelligence officials fear the affiliate's innovative agility. ''The fastest-learning enemy we have is A.Q.A.P.,'' said the senior United States official.
In recent months, as the Yemeni government has become nearly paralyzed, the Obama administration has stepped up pressure on the Qaeda affiliate there. It has escalated a campaign of airstrikes carried out by the Pentagon's Joint Special Operations Command with the C.I.A.'s help. The C.I.A. is building a base in the region to serve as a hub for future operations in Yemen.
The Pentagon's air campaign in Yemen was renewed in May after a nearly yearlong hiatus; since then the military has carried out at least four airstrikes in the country.
The ricin plots believed to be emanating from Yemen are the latest example of terrorists' desire to obtain and deploy unconventional weapons in attacks. In 1995, the Aum Shinrikyo cult released sarin nerve gas on underground trains in Tokyo, killing 12 people and injuring more than 5,000, and nearly paralyzing one of the world's leading economies for weeks.
In 2003, British and French operatives broke up suspected Qaeda cells that possessed components and manuals for making ricin bombs and maps of the London subway system.
A ricin-dispersing bomb detonated in a major subway system or in a mall or at a major airport would not result in mass destruction on the scale of the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, counterterrorism specialists said. But it could inflict disproportionate psychological terror on big-city transportation systems. ''Is it going to kill many people? No,'' said Mr. Leiter, the former counterterrorism official. ''Is it going to be a big news story and is it going to scare some people? Yes.''
Months after the initial ricin intelligence reports surfaced last year, Saudi intelligence officials revealed a twist to the ricin plot: Qaeda operatives were trying to place the toxin in bottles of perfume, especially a popular local fragrance made of the resin of agarwood, and send those bottles as gifts to assassinate government officials and law enforcement and military officers. There is no indication that Al Qaeda ever succeeded with this approach, intelligence officials said.

HEADLINE: Along the Jersey Shore, A Struggle to Get to the Sand

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
SEA BRIGHT, N.J. -- If you find the rare parking spot here, and climb one of the few public stairways over the seawall to a crowded patch of sand, you might notice a nearly empty expanse of beach nearby, beyond a ''no trespassing'' sign.
Step past the sign, and a young man might zoom up on an all-terrain vehicle to shoo you away, warning that this is the property of the Surfrider Beach Club. When questioned one recent afternoon, the young man said he knew nothing of the long-standing legal principle -- and, more to the point, a 2009 court settlement -- that appear to establish that the portion of beach he was patrolling is open to everyone.
Nearby, a group of friends who drove down for the day from Teaneck obeyed the sign, but it did not sit well. ''Look at all that empty beach,'' Samantha Soler, 20, said. ''It doesn't seem right.'' 
This is summer at the Jersey Shore, a low-cost escape for millions of people from several states, most of them unaware that they have stepped into perennial conflicts over how they can use the beaches.
Many places welcome visitors and their business, but for generations, some property owners, neighborhoods and towns have tried to stem that tide with scarce or time-limited parking, claims of private ownership, bans on food and drinks, and paths to the sand that are few in number or disguised.
The wealthy Elberon section of Long Branch has plenty of beach access routes, but some can be hard to discern. One path from Garfield Terrace is fenced off, with a ''residents only'' sign, though people who know better ignore the sign and go through the gate.
Adams Street, a nearby cul-de-sac, reaches a dead end about 50 yards from the beach, and the remaining distance is landscaped, looking like private property. The shrubs nearly obscure a small blue sign, marking it as public access.
Long Branch agreed to the landscaping recently, to settle a lawsuit filed by Charles Kushner, a real estate developer who was a Democratic power broker before he was convicted in 2005 of witness tampering, tax evasion and making illegal campaign contributions. Mr. Kushner owns the properties on both sides of Adams Street, including a sprawling house, and had sought to take over the strip between them.
Vincent LePore, a local activist who questions the legality of the settlement, called it an example of ''rich people getting what they want out of these towns.''
Mr. Kushner did not respond to messages seeking comment.
Fights over outsiders using beaches are as traditional as saltwater taffy and concerts at the Stone Pony, but not at all limited to New Jersey.
On the Rockaways peninsula of Queens, for example, street parking is banned on summer weekends in some neighborhoods, making it nearly impossible for visitors to get to the public beach. In Malibu, Calif., the record impresario David Geffen fought for years to stop people from using a path that cut through his property, before relenting and opening the gate he had installed there.
New Jersey and many other coastal states recognize an ancient principle that a beach should be open to the public from the water's edge at least up to the ''mean high-water line,'' a shifting boundary open to varied interpretations. Adding to the uncertainty, the State Supreme Court ruled in 2005 that above that line, the public may also use a stretch of dry sand whose width ''will depend on the circumstances.''
Even more contentious is what ability the public should have in gaining access to its sand, since most of the land between the open beach and the nearest street belongs to private homeowners who would just as soon not have their neighborhoods turn into a reality TV show.
The state and the Army Corps of Engineers have said that beaches they have replenished, like ones at Sea Bright, Long Beach and Long Branch, should have public access at least every half mile. But in Sea Bright and some other towns, there are longer stretches where private properties form an uninterrupted barrier, and even where there is access, restrictive parking rules and questionable signage often keeps people away.
Some towns even barred nonresidents from their beaches, until the courts struck that down in the 1980s. And a few years ago, it looked as if things had swung decisively in favor of shore users over shore dwellers.
Gov. Jon S. Corzine's administration required access points every quarter-mile, and more parking, bathrooms and showers. But the State Supreme Court struck down parts of that policy, and Gov. Chris Christie's administration said this year that it planned to maintain something like the status quo, giving municipalities ample leeway to set their own rules.
The skirmishes have an element of class resentment; the surfing, angling and other groups that fight for access say that the least welcoming places are in towns like Sea Bright and Deal, where multimillion-dollar homes and private clubs dominate the shoreline. At the other extreme are lower-income towns like Asbury Park and Seaside Heights, which embrace inlanders who fuel their economies.
In a few towns, ''the officials or the wealthy residents, or both, want to act like they have private beaches,'' said John Weber, Northeast regional manager of the Surfrider Foundation, which has no connection to the beach club.
A few towns, like Long Branch and Long Beach, have split personalities -- very accommodating in commercial areas, but not in residential neighborhoods.
Adam Schneider, the mayor of Long Branch for 21 years, said he was committed to public beach rights, but dismissed the idea of treating ''an exclusively residential neighborhood that also happens to be an exclusive neighborhood'' the same as a town center filled with shops and restaurants.
''We're never going to satisfy all the fishermen, the surfers, the gadflies,'' he said, ''and I'm O.K. with that.''
In the residential Loveladies section of Long Beach Township, an outsider finds few places to park and fewer ways to reach the beach. The state's map of access points shows one gap of more than two-thirds of a mile. Some entrances shown on the map have ''private drive'' signs, or bushes obscuring the routes.
Town officials say that with no businesses there, and plenty of access and amenities in the center of Long Beach, outsiders have little reason to visit that beach, anyway.
In Sea Bright, private clubs occupy much of the beachfront. Two years ago, those clubs settled a suit filed by the state, acknowledging the public's right to use 60 percent of the beach, up to a maximum 150 feet inland from the high-tide line.
Beach users say the Surfrider Club, which posted the no-trespassing signs this year, has been the most aggressive about keeping people away. Calls to the club's owner, James LoBiondo, were not returned.
''Those signs don't look right to me, I don't like them and they've created a lot of hard feelings, but I don't know that there's anything we can do about it,'' said Dina Long, who leads the Borough Council's beach committee.
Ms. Long called the half-mile standard good in principle but unrealistic in practice, as it would require the town to do extensive financial and legal wrangling with property owners. She conceded that public parking is inadequate -- the clubs have their own lots -- but said there were few alternatives on a peninsula barely a block wide in places.
On the northern shore, all towns charge for use of some or all beaches -- as little as $4 for a day pass, and in some places, less than $30 for the season.
Deal, an affluent borough in Monmouth County, charges the state's highest season pass fee, $125, and while its day pass is just $5, parking restrictions keep day trippers away. Mantoloking, where parking is scarce, charges $12 for a season's pass, and does not offer a day pass, so it effectively has both the cheapest seasonal rate and the most expensive day rate.
''A place like Deal makes it really clear they don't want you there,'' said Ray Menell, a member of the Asbury Park Fishing Club.
Borough officials did not return calls seeking comment.
Mr. Schneider, the Long Branch mayor, said that without a state standard, some towns would go too far in keeping people out, but that a one-size-fits-all rule was unworkable.
''It's a tough balance,'' he said. ''This fight is not going away. It'll never end.''

HEADLINE: An Aftershock With Precedent

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Like earthquakes, financial crises seem to be accompanied by aftershocks, like the one we've been living through this week. They can feel every bit as bad as the crisis itself. But economic history and academic research suggest they can set the stage for a sustainable recovery -- and eventual sharp stock market gains.
The events of the last few weeks -- gridlock in Washington, brinksmanship over raising the debt ceiling, Standard & Poor's downgrade of long-term Treasuries, renewed fears about European debt and a dizzying plunge in the stock market -- bear an intriguing resemblance to some of the events of 1937-38, the so-called recession within the Depression, with a major caveat: it was a lot worse back then. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 49 percent from its peak in 1937. Manufacturing output fell by 37 percent, a steeper decline than in 1929-33. Unemployment, which had been slowly declining, to 14 percent from 25 percent, surged to 19 percent. Price declines led to deflation. 
''The parallels to what is happening now are very strong,'' Robert McElvaine, author of ''The Great Depression: America, 1929-1941'' and a professor of history at Millsaps College, said this week. Then as now, policy makers were struggling with how and when to turn off the fiscal stimulus and monetary easing that had been used to combat the initial crisis.
Are we at similar risk today? David Bianco, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch Bank of America, told me this week that ''the market is collapsing faster than any fundamentals would warrant.'' The possibility that the United States faces a recession as bad as 1937's seems far-fetched. Nonetheless, Mr. Bianco notes that the market is now pricing in an 80 percent chance of recession, one likely to be more severe than in 1991. (He said Merrill Lynch places the odds at 35 percent.) He noted that there had been only three instances when such a steep market decline was not followed by recession: 1966, 1987 (after the October stock market crash) and 1998 (after the implosion of Long Term Capital Management.) ''Confidence is shaken and rapidly falling,'' he said, a problem worsened by falling stock prices.
By 1937 an economic recovery seemed to be in full swing, giving policy makers every reason to believe the economy was strong enough to withdraw government stimulus. Growth from 1933 to 1936 averaged a booming 9 percent a year (rivaling modern-day China's), albeit from a very low base. The federal debt had swelled to 40 percent of gross domestic product in 1936 (from 16 percent in 1929.). Faced with strident calls from both Republicans and members of his own party to balance the federal budget, President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Congress raised income taxes, levied a Social Security tax (which preceded by several years any payments of benefits) and slashed federal spending in an effort to balance the federal budget. Income-tax revenue grew by 66 percent between 1936 and 1937 and the marginal tax rate on incomes over $4,000 nearly doubled, to 11.6 percent from an average marginal rate of 6.4 percent. (The marginal tax rate on the rich -- those making over $1 million -- went to 75 percent, from 59 percent.)
The Federal Reserve did its part to throw the economy back into recession by tightening credit. Wholesale prices were rising in 1936, setting off inflation fears. There was concern that the Fed's accommodative monetary policies of the 1920s had led to asset speculation that precipitated the 1929 crash and ensuing Depression. The Fed responded by increasing banks' reserve requirements in several stages, leading to a drop in the money supply.
The possible causes of the ensuing stock market plunge and steep contraction in the economy provide fodder for just about everyone in the current political debate. Republicans can point to the Roosevelt tax increases. Democrats have the spending reductions, which coincides with Mr. McElvaine's view. ''It appears clear to me that the cause was policies put into effect in 1936-37, mainly cutting spending when F.D.R. believed his re-election was secured,'' he said.
The Nobel-prize winning economist Milton Friedman blamed the Fed and the contraction in the money supply in his epic ''Monetary History of the U.S.'' And the stock market itself may have been a culprit, falling so steeply that it wiped out the wealth effect of rising prices, undermined confidence and brought back painful memories of the crash. But taken together, they suggest that policy makers moved too quickly to withdraw government support for the economy.
In the current context, it's hard to blame the Fed for being too restrictive in its monetary policy, as the Fed was in 1937. If anything, critics fault it for being too accommodating, raising many of the same issues that led the Fed to tighten in 1937. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, is a student of Depression history and is well aware of Mr. Friedman's monetary analysis. ''He won't make the same mistake,'' Jeremy Siegel, professor of finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said.
The Fed's pledge this week to keep interest rates near zero not just for a vague ''extended period'' but for a full two years rendered two-year Treasuries virtually risk-free and depressed their yields to a record low of 0.19 percent. This should lead investors to seek income from riskier assets, leading to lower interest rates across the spectrum, including mortgage rates.
Despite a brief stock market rally after the Fed's announcement, Mr. Bianco said he believed investors might be underestimating the significance of the Fed's move. ''You will see household funding costs go down. That will be a benefit and should boost confidence.'' At the least, ''The Fed has not abandoned us. They're doing what they can,'' he said.
But monetary policy can only do so much, especially if fiscal policy is moving in the opposite direction.
Christina Romer, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who has written extensively about the Great Depression, declared two years ago while chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisors: ''The urge to declare victory and get back to normal after an economic crisis is strong. That urge needs to be resisted.''
Yet both political parties have strapped themselves to the mast of deficit reduction, one through spending cuts, the other tax increases. The recent market plunge may reflect not the largely symbolic S.& P. downgrade of United States Treasuries or worries about political gridlock, but widespread investor fears that both approaches risk a renewed recession by withdrawing stimulus from a fragile economy too soon. No one seriously disagrees that the budget deficit has to be addressed, either through spending cuts or tax increases or in some combination of the two. The question is when.
The good news about the 1937-38 recession, severe though it was, is that it lasted just a year, from May 1937 to June 1938 by most calculations. The precipitous 1937 stock market decline and surging unemployment jolted Washington into action. The Fed reversed its higher bank reserves policy and cut the discount rate to 1 percent. In April, President Roosevelt announced a $2 billion ''spend-lend'' program and embraced deficit spending. But the tax increases remained in effect. Economic growth resumed in June 1938 and was stronger than it had been in the 1933-37 period. Stocks surged.
Of course, history never repeats itself exactly, and unfortunately for today's policy makers, the causes of the 1938 economic rebound seem less clear than the causes of the recession. While Keynesians have embraced the Roosevelt stimulus package to support their arguments for government intervention, others argue it came too late and was too small to account for the recovery. A Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago senior economist, Francois Velde, concluded that while traditional monetary and fiscal analyses tended to account for the severity of the 1937 downturn, other still-unidentified factors are needed to explain why the economy ''rebounded so strongly.''
Still, the sense that Washington was doing something to address the problems may have played a key role by bolstering confidence, which was reinforced by rising stock prices.
Historians can't know if the 1938 recovery, strong as it was, would have been enough to finally end the Great Depression. World War II intervened. But nothing today seems nearly as dire as the problems facing the world in 1938. The 1937 aftershocks had the effect of galvanizing policy makers who had grown complacent about the recovery. The result was renewed economic growth, higher employment, higher wages and productivity -- and higher stock prices. Investors who had the courage to buy stocks at their 1937 lows were looking at a 60 percent gain less than a year later.
Online Correction: August 12, 2011, Friday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this column published online paraphrased the views of the chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch Bank of America incorrectly. The strategist, David Bianco, said that the market is pricing in an 80 percent chance of a recession; that is not his personal opinion. (He said Merrill Lynch places the odds at 35 percent.)

HEADLINE: Enrollment Plunge for DeVry Sends Stock Lower

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
DeVry, the operator of DeVry University, said new undergraduate enrollment fell 26 percent, setting off a 17 percent loss in its share price. New summer enrollment dropped to 15,566, from 20,935 a year earlier, DeVry said. State and federal officials have been investigating profit-making colleges, and the Education Department has put new restrictions on financing for education companies. Adjusting to the regulations created distractions for employees, DeVry said Thursday. ''Enrollment has been most impacted by the prolonged economic downturn and continued high unemployment, which has led some potential students to defer or refrain from making the commitment to enroll in college,'' the company said. Stock in DeVry, which is based in Downers Grove, Ill., fell $8.90 to $44.49 a share.
