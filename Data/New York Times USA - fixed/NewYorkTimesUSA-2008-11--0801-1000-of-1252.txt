HEADLINE: Now, the Side Dishes: Quick and Simple Or a Bit More Complex

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
A NEIGHBOR stopped by the other day to talk about her Thanksgiving plans. Last year, she didn't really give the meal much thought. She bought a turkey that was already cooked, and asked guests to bring the side dishes.
 This year is different, she said. Between the intensity of the election and the uncertainty of the economy, the meal means more to her. She plans to cook everything herself, using as much local food as she can and making even the pies from scratch.
 For a professional colleague in Los Angeles, the quality of the company will matter more than the food this year. She is cutting out all the C-list relatives and spending the day only with the people who matter most. 
 Then there is an old college friend with a steady job, a healthy child and not much to worry about in the way of investments. She isn't changing a thing about her Thanksgiving dinner. After all, it's not like the country hasn't had a new president or economic troubles before. 
 As they do every year, people come to the Thanksgiving table with a wide variety of needs and expectations. Some, like the pilgrims, arrive with a sense of hope, and the energy to face something new. Others may want to hold on to tradition and avoid any extra drama.
 That translates to the menu. Some cooks want a simpler game plan, while others are looking to trick out the meal with a few challenges and a little luxury. 
 With the help of a few chefs, I searched for recipes that would satisfy both impulses. The idea was to create two versions each of stuffing, potatoes and a vegetable side dish. One version is ingredient driven and straightforward. The other is more complex, in both technique and ingredients. 
 Perhaps you want to flash a little bling in the face of a bad economy. For you, we have a rich stuffing created by Malika Ameen, the pastry chef and an owner of Aigre Doux in Chicago.
 Ms. Ameen, who was raised in Chicago eating mostly traditional Pakistani food, fell in love with Thanksgiving as a child. ''I love that feeling on Thanksgiving when you wake up early in the morning and smell celery cooking in butter,'' she said.
 She studs her stuffing with candied chestnuts, chanterelle mushrooms and apple, then finishes the dish with black truffle butter.
 Perhaps this just isn't the year for so much luxury on your table. In that case, we offer a lighter, simpler stuffing inspired by the bread salad that goes under the roast chicken at Zuni Cafe in San Francisco. It begins with rustic bread, onions and sage but gets an acidic punch from a mixture of stock and tangy red wine vinegar.
 Jeremy Fox, the chef at the vegetarian restaurant and yoga studio Ubuntu in Napa, Calif., offers a sophisticated puree of apples, onions and Dijon mustard as a base for brussels sprouts leaves that are tossed with caraway seeds and sauteed for just a few minutes before serving. It's a dish with a simple presentation that belies the layering of flavors involved in its preparation. 
 That dish's less complex vegetable sibling starts with shaved savoy cabbage, spicy shredded radish and tart apples. This cool, crunchy Thanksgiving slaw is tossed with applesauce vinaigrette. It's best served immediately, but the laid-back slaw lasts just fine for an hour or so in the refrigerator.
 A fall walk through New York's Greenmarket with Eleven Madison Park's chef, Daniel Humm, brought ideas for two radically different approaches to potatoes.
 Roast a variety of fingerling potatoes from the farmers' market with figs, thyme and whole garlic cloves still in their jackets. Or get all chef-y and create mashed potatoes as they do in Mr. Humm's kitchen. 
 The trick is sending the potatoes through a ricer, then a fine sieve or a tamis, a task that requires the dedication of a good sous-chef. Then mix in reduced cream, a swirl of nutty browned butter, a little sprinkle of fleur de sel and a fresh shaving or two of nutmeg.
 Traditionalists, of course, might just stick with mashed-in-the-pot potatoes, Aunt Miriam's stuffing and some green bean casserole. After all, it's a free country.

 Adapted from Jeremy Fox, Ubuntu, Napa, Calif. 
 Time: 1 hour 15 minutes
 2 pounds brussels sprouts
 4 tablespoons unsalted butter
 1 1/2 cups thinly sliced onion (1 medium)
 Salt 
 2 pounds Golden or Red Delicious apples (about 6)
 3/4 cup apple juice 
 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard (do not use grainy mustard)
 3 shallots, chopped fine (1 cup)
 1 tablespoon caraway seeds
 2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar. 
 1. Wash brussels sprouts and trim roots. Separate leaves and place them in a bowl. Cover and refrigerate. (Can be completed the day before.)
 2. Warm a large saute pan over medium heat. Melt 2 tablespoons butter, then add onions and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until onions are soft, about 15 minutes.
 3. Peel, core and slice 5 apples. Add to pan with onions. Cook on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until apples soften and begin to break apart, about 20 minutes. Add apple juice and simmer for 10 minutes. Add mustard and remove from heat. 
 4. Put apple-onion mixture in a blender or food processor and pulse 6 to 8 times until smooth. Keep warm.
 5. Warm a very large saute pan over medium heat. Melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter, then add shallots. Cook for 5 minutes, until shallots are soft and translucent. Stir in caraway seeds. Add brussels sprout leaves and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes. Add vinegar and continue cooking until leaves are just tender, about 5 more minutes. Season with salt to taste. Julienne remaining apple with skin on.
 6. Spoon apple-mustard puree onto a warmed serving platter. Pile sauteed brussels sprouts on puree. Sprinkle julienned apple on top. Serve immediately.
 Yield: 10 to 12 servings.

HEADLINE: Fickle Stock Market Closes Higher, Digesting Political Hearings and Profits

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
A day after Wall Street plunged during the last hour of trading, markets closed higher on Tuesday after a 3 p.m. rally scooped languishing stocks out of negative territory. 
 Markets seesawed in light volume on Tuesday as investors once again swung their focus between corporate earnings and hearings on Capitol Hill, where lawmakers and executives argued over the $700 billion bailout and debated the fate of America's flagging auto industry. 
 A strong outlook from the computer maker Hewlett-Packard sent shares higher early in the day, but foreboding economic data and ever-present worries about the size and depth of the economic downturn dragged them back down before the late rally. 
 ''High volatility is now the norm,'' said Brian Belski, chief United States sector strategist at Merrill Lynch. ''It wouldn't be a regular day in the market unless you see these big swings.''
 The Dow Jones industrial average rebounded from a 168-point deficit to end the day higher by 151.17 points, or 1.83 percent, at 8,424.75. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 8.37 points, or 0.98 percent, to finish at 859.12. 
 The technology-heavy Nasdaq posted the lowest gains of the major indexes, adding 1.22 points, or 0.08 percent, to finish at 1,483.27. 
 Equity analysts, searching for signs of a bottom, said that financial markets have tested their yearly lows in recent trading sessions, dropping within reach of new bottoms only to recover by the closing bell. Linda Duessel, an equity strategist at Federated Investors, said Tuesday's bounce fit that pattern.
 ''That should go down as another successful test,'' she said, but added, ''We're not opening any bottles tonight.''
 Hewlett-Packard led the Dow's advance after the computer maker posted a preliminary revenue gain of 19 percent during its fiscal fourth quarter, to $33.6 billion, from $28.3 billion during the comparable period last year. The positive report, a rare glimmer amid a litany of lower profits and slumping sales, sent Hewlett's shares up 14.5 percent, to $33.59 a share.
 Technology shares, which had fallen about 50 percent since the start of the year, rose on Tuesday. Computer makers including Dell, Sun Microsystems, Intel and Apple finished higher, but Sony fell 1.5 percent.
 Shares of the home-improvement retailer Home Depot closed 3.6 percent higher at $20.71 after the company reported third-quarter earnings that beat Wall Street expectations. The home-supply chain reported earnings of 45 cents a share, compared with estimates of 38 cents. 
 Still, the company reported that its third-quarter earnings fell 31 percent compared with last year, to $756 million from $1.1 billion. And sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial indicator, had shrunk 8.3 percent since last year.
 ''The housing and home improvement markets remain challenging,'' Home Depot's chief executive, Frank S. Blake, said in a statement. ''Across our entire business, we are making the adjustments necessary to respond to a tough market environment.''
 Yahoo rose 8.7 percent, to $11.55 a share, a day after its chief executive, Jerry Yang, said he would step down. Mr. Yang led the company through a tumultuous time, marked by Microsoft's failed takeover bid and Yahoo's sliding share price.
 And shares in General Motors and the Ford Motor Company closed down as the Big Three automotive executives prepared to ask Congress to bail out the struggling auto industry. Members of the Senate Banking Committee were still delivering their introductory remarks as the markets closed. 
 In a report that drew mixed reaction on Tuesday, the wholesale prices of goods like oil and metals dropped by a record 2.8 percent in October as the economic slump burst this summer's commodities bubble. The price of energy plunged 12.8 percent from September to October on falling demand for oil, and food costs fell 0.2 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported.
 Gasoline prices, which hit record highs above $4 a gallon this summer, tumbled 24.9 percent in October. Wholesale natural gas prices fell 13.3 percent, while the price of diesel, which fuels long-range container trucks, dropped 16.4 percent.
 ''It's beneficial that energy prices are coming down,'' said Abiel Reinhart, an economist at JPMorgan. ''It puts a lot more real disposable income in people's pockets. It's advantageous to the United States and consumers.''
 And while falling prices make it cheaper to create microprocessors, transport cars or fill up gas tanks, they are also a portent of a rapidly downshifting economy, analysts said.
 ''The price of commodities fell at the greatest rate in over half a century,'' Joseph Brusuelas, chief economist of Merk Investments, said. ''Will the U.S. consumer continue to retrench and increase savings, or will that good news provide them with a little bit of stimulus?''
 Crude oil in New York trading settled down 56 cents to $54.39 a barrel.
 In Europe, the markets reversed early losses and closed higher. The FTSE 100 index in London closed up 1.8 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris rose 1.1 percent, and the DAX in Frankfurt showed a gain of 0.49 percent. 
 Every Asian market fell, as investors in the region caught up with Monday's drop on Wall Street. In Tokyo, the benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 2.3 percent, while in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index closed down 5.1 percent. The S&P/ASX 200 index in Sydney lost 3.6 percent. 
 In the United States, the yield on the 10-year note fell to 3.53 percent, from 3.65 percent.

HEADLINE: Emerging Countries Called Key to Global Recovery

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

DATELINE: BARCELONA 

 BODY:
The United States may have plunged the world into a sharp economic downturn, but it will take the combined efforts of China and other emerging nations to lead the global economy out of what is likely to be a long and painful recession.
 That was the view of several business executives, government officials and economic experts gathered Monday and Tuesday for a conference on China's role in the global economy. 
 ''China alone may be only 6 percent of the world economy,'' said Josep Pique, chairman of Vueling, a budget airline based in Barcelona. ''But together with India, Brazil and other big emerging nations, they represent about 30 percent of global G.D.P. The emerging countries are the solution to the overall global slump.''
 That point of view was echoed by Claude Begle, chairman of Swiss Post, which runs Switzerland's public savings bank, who predicted that Asian emerging nations would be the first to recover from the slump, followed by the United States and then Europe.
 But not everybody was so confident in the ability of China and Asia's other fast-growing countries to spur a global recovery.
 ''China cannot replace the U.S. economy as the engine of global growth,'' said Chang Dae Whan, chairman of Maeil, a South Korean newspaper company. ''We're going to need a huge stimulus package from the United States, on the order of $2 trillion, to get the global economy out of the financial crisis. So far, we've only seen about $700 billion. As a result, next year I expect to see more pain and fear.''
 The Global China Business Meeting here, sponsored by Horasis, a consulting organization based in Geneva, and supported by several business and government organizations in Spain, China and elsewhere, is the fourth annual gathering of the group, whose goal is to encourage more trade and business contact between China and Europe.
 The Chinese economy, for all its success since emerging from economic isolation in the 1980s, is at a major turning point, participants here suggested, that will require a fundamental adjustment in its approach to development.
 Timothy Beardson, chairman of Albert Place Holdings in Hong Kong and a leading adviser to companies doing business in China, said that China had lost a number of advantages that powered its phenomenal double-digit growth rates of recent years.
 ''For the last 10 years, China had it good,'' Mr. Beardson said. ''For the next 10 years, it won't have it so good at all.''
 He pointed to several factors that are going to make it far more difficult for China to rely on booming exports to power its growth and to improve the nation's standard of living at a rapid pace. 
 He said that China spends far less on research and development, as a share of its economy, than Japan, the United States and most other advanced economies, making it difficult to upgrade China's industrial structure. 
 He also said that China has a weak system of higher education, and lacks any substantial social safety net, which makes its citizens fearful about their future and encourages them to save to excess rather than spend.
 The most immediate challenge, he said, was that China's currency, while rising only modestly against the dollar, has strengthened significantly against the currencies of its Asian competitors and against most European currencies, making its exports far less competitive in global markets.
 ''If Chinese companies are to succeed in the future,'' he said, they will have to recognize that ''their comparative advantage lies in the domestic market, not the export economy.''
 Chinese officials here, while acknowledging many difficulties, made clear that they were convinced that the nation would weather the first real test of its economic resilience since Beijing adopted a market approach to economic development. But they said that China would need to work more closely with other economies, including the United States and Europe, to overcome the current financial crisis.
 ''Confidence and cooperation,'' said Xu Kuangdi, chairman of the China Federation of Industrial Economics, ''are worth more than money and gold.''

HEADLINE: For Sale in ... British Columbia, Canada

BYLINE: By LISA KEYS

 BODY:
CHALET IN WHISTLER, BRITISH COLUMBIA
 829,000 CANADIAN DOLLARS ($678,119)
 This one-bedroom two-bath chalet, built in the 1970s, has a den, a sleeping loft and a separate one-bedroom apartment. The house has 1,400 square feet of living space and is on a sloped lot.
 Common spaces are on the lower level. Heated slate tiles run throughout the entryway, hall and kitchen. The living room has a freestanding wood-burning stove. There is a separate heated storage area on the lower level, too. 
 The master bedroom is at street level. The master bath has heated tiles, a double-headed shower and a soaking tub. A ladder leads to the windowed loft.
 The house is surrounded by outdoor living space: a 200-square-foot back deck off the living room, and two decks off the master bedroom (a 400-square-foot deck in front and a 100-square foot deck in back). There is also a 200-square-foot deck off the rental apartment.
 The quarter-acre property has mature trees and indigenous vegetation, as well as a fire pit area with a rock wall for privacy.
 The chalet is in Emerald Estates, a subdivision about three miles from Whistler Village, where there are shops, restaurants and hotels. Vancouver International Airport is a two-and-a-half-hour drive. Improvements on the Sea to Sky Highway in preparation for the 2010 Olympics (which will be held in both Whistler and Vancouver) should reduce the commute to about 90 minutes, said John McGregor, a sales representative at Re/Max Sea to Sky Real Estate Whistler. 
 MARKET OVERVIEW
 Housing prices have doubled over the past 10 to 12 years, and even nearly tripled in certain areas, Mr. McGregor said. Most notably, there was a period of rapid appreciation from about 2001 to 2003, said Patrick Kelly, president and owner of the Whistler Real Estate Company.
 Since the financial crisis, the volume of sales in Whistler has slowed significantly, said Dale Wilcox, a Vancouver-based real estate lawyer who handles many deals at the ski resort. As a result, prices have contracted somewhat. So far this year, through the end of September, the median price for sold chalets has been 1.295 million Canadian dollars ($1.059 million) and, for condominiums, 349,000 Canadian dollars ($285,481), according to data from the Linnell Group of Realtors at the Whistler Real Estate Company. 
 WHO BUYS
 Though Whistler attracts visitors from around the globe, the overwhelming majority of homeowners are from Vancouver; Victoria, British Columbia; and Seattle, Mr. Kelly said. Ten to 15 percent of Whistler's buyers come from the United States, he added, while 5 to 10 percent come from the ''rest of the world'' -- the Pacific Rim in particular.
 BUYING BASICS
 There are no restrictions on real estate purchases by foreigners in Whistler. The province of British Columbia levies a property transfer tax, which is 1 percent on the first $200,000 of a property and 2 percent on the balance. A goods-and-services tax is applicable in some real estate transactions. 
 Though there are exceptions and exemptions, a 5 percent federal goods-and-services tax applies to new construction, as well as to property used for short-term rentals. (In lieu of paying the tax upon closing, owners of properties being rented on a nightly or weekly basis can apply for a goods-and-services tax number from the Canada Revenue Agency. This enables them to collect goods-and-services tax from guests and remit it to the government.)
 Additional purchase expenses include an estimated 1,500 to 2,000 Canadian dollars ($818 to $1,227) for lawyer's fees, and transfer and registration costs, said Dave Burch, a sales representative at the Whistler Real Estate Company. Foreign buyers relying on mortgages should plan on a 40 to 50 percent down payment, Mr. McGregor said.

HEADLINE: Questions on Steroids, Health Care Reform, and the 'Nocebo' Effect

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
New Questions on Steroids 
 A class of steroid drugs used in premature babies and in pregnant women at risk for a preterm delivery have been found to cause irreversible damage to brain cells in animal studies, USA Today reports. 
 The 'Nocebo' Effect
 Consumers may think it's wise to read the warning labels on medications they take, but doing so can trigger the very symptoms they've read about, a phenomenon called the ''nocebo effect,'' The Wall Street Journal reports.
 An Epidemic of Kidney Disease
 The number of Americans suffering from chronic kidney disease, which is caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure and diabetes, has increased to 26 million, up from about 20 million a decade ago, The New York Times reports. One cause, according to researchers: the U.S. population is aging and becoming increasingly obese.
 A Son's Controversial Recovery
 A mother chronicles what she describes as her son's recovery from an autism-spectrum disorder in The Washington Post, saying his is one of a number of cases being studied by researchers. While some children have improved, most seem to have ongoing problems such as social phobias, the author says, and experts are not sure how to define recovery or whether it exists.
 Next, a Push for Health Care Reform
 Tough economic times may spur fundamental health care reform after President-elect Barack Obama takes office, The Los Angeles Times reports. Hospitals are faced with increasing numbers of uninsured patients, businesses are worried about escalating health costs, and some liberal groups see the federal government's bailout package of the financial sector as a relevant precedent.

HEADLINE: ESPN Outbids Fox Sports and Wins B.C.S. Rights

BYLINE: By LYNN ZINSER

 BODY:
With a significantly higher bid and plans to broadcast all of the games on cable, ESPN snatched the rights to college football's Bowl Championship Series from 2011 to 2014. 
 Fox Sports, the current rights-holder, pulled out of the bidding Monday, and ESPN announced its deal Tuesday. Several reports said Fox would not offer more than $100 million a year while ESPN agreed to pay $125 million for television, radio, digital, international and marketing rights. Digital rights include the operation of the official B.C.S. Web site, and the simulcasting of games online and for mobile devices.
 Neither officials with the B.C.S. nor ESPN would confirm the terms of their agreement.
 ESPN's president, George Bodenheimer, said the network planned to keep all of the games on ESPN and not broadcast any on ABC, but would not charge cable providers a premium. ESPN is available to about 98 million homes on an extended basic-cable tier. Disney owns ESPN and ABC.
 Fox was paying $82.5 million a year for the current four-year deal to broadcast the Fiesta, Orange and Sugar Bowls, as well as the B.C.S. championship game. The new deal covers the Fiesta, Orange and Sugar Bowls from 2011 to 2014 and the championship game from 2011 to 2013. The Rose Bowl retains a separate agreement with ABC and is the scheduled home for the title game in 2014.
 ''ESPN provides tremendous regular-season coverage of college football,'' said John Swofford, the B.C.S. coordinator and the commissioner of the Atlantic Coast Conference. ''The culture they've created is a natural fit for the B.C.S., and you can't overlook the financial difference. It's substantive.''
 ESPN has long made college sports a backbone of its coverage, starting with its early broadcasts of college basketball. It has grown into a significant part of its franchise.
 Fox officials made a point about allowing a major sporting event like the B.C.S. to move to cable when they announced the network had pulled out of the bidding.
 ''Even with today's vast economic uncertainties, Fox Sports made a very competitive bid to keep broadcasting B.C.S. games free to every home in America, one that included a substantial rights fee increase and certainly as much as any over-the-air network could responsibly risk,'' Fox said in a statement. ''Unfortunately, the university presidents and B.C.S. commissioners were not satisfied, and they've decided to take their jewel events to pay television.''
 Swofford, though, said he was comfortable moving the championship off over-the-air television.
 ''You're talking about a situation where we're seeing more and more sporting events go to cable,'' Swofford said. ''Certainly, I think that the college football community, people who truly follow college football, are extremely well tuned into ESPN.''
 The end of the ESPN deal coincides with the date -- 2014 -- through which the B.C.S. commissioners have agreed to keep their current championship system in place. The commissioners met last April and considered a playoff proposal by Mike Slive, the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference, but voted against it and put off considering any changes until the end of the next television deal.

HEADLINE: Ford to Raise Cash by Selling Mazda Shares

BYLINE: By REUTERS

DATELINE: TOKYO 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company, scrambling for cash as it struggles to stay alive, has agreed to sell about two-thirds of its stake in the Japanese carmaker Mazda Motor for about $538 million. 
 Ford first took a stake in Mazda in 1979 and raised it to a controlling interest of 33.4 percent in 1996. It will remain Mazda's top shareholder at 13 percent after selling the shares to Mazda and to some Mazda business partners.
 Mazda said it planned to buy back 6.87 percent of its own shares from Ford for up to 17.9 billion yen ($185 million). More than 20 undisclosed Mazda business partners will buy the remaining shares Ford is selling.
 Reeling from slowing sales, Detroit's General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, which is owned by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, are trying to raise cash to weather the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. 
 As part of the ownership change, Mazda said two directors -- the chief financial officer, David E. Friedman, and the chief of sales and marketing, Daniel T. Morris -- will return to Ford. The executive vice president, Philip G. Spender, will remain.
 Hisakazu Imaki -- the first Japanese chief executive of Mazda after a string of four Ford executives at the helm since 1996 -- will cede his post to another executive vice president, Takashi Yamanouchi, to become chairman.
 All personnel changes will take effect on Wednesday.
 The two companies, which share vehicle platforms and engineering resources and jointly own assembly plants in the United States, Thailand and China, will maintain their strategic ties, Mr. Imaki said at a news conference at Mazda headquarters in Hiroshima.

HEADLINE: Facing a Slowdown, China's Auto Industry Presses for a Bailout From Beijing

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Choe Sang-hun contributed reporting from Seoul.

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
Do Chinese automakers need a bailout? 
 China's car industry is quietly pressing Beijing for government help as it copes with a jarring slowdown, top Chinese auto executives said in interviews here on Tuesday. 
 This autumn, after six years of 20 percent or more annual growth, vehicle sales were flat or slightly negative, a shock to an industry that has borrowed heavily to build ever more factories for a market that had once seemed insatiable.
 Citing the $25 billion in loans that Congress has already approved to help American automakers increase green research, and the additional $25 billion in loans the American industry is seeking this week to cope with a hobbled economy, Chinese executives are now telling the government here that they also need emergency measures. They are seeking lower taxes on new cars, lower fuel prices and increased grants for research into hybrid cars and new technology.
 ''The Chinese government will undoubtedly support us,'' said She Cairong, the general manager of JAC Motors, adding that state-owned Chinese banks had already become more willing to lend money to Chinese automakers in recent weeks as bank regulators have eased restrictions on loans to heavy industry. 
 Still, Mr. She and other industry leaders said that while government officials have voiced concern to them about the industry's deteriorating condition, Beijing has not committed to any specific help.
 ''They're asking the questions but they haven't said anything yet'' on how aid might be structured, said Frank Zhao, vice president and chief technology officer of Geely Automobile Holdings. ''We really hope the Chinese government will come and help us.''
 Michael Dunne, the managing director for China at J. D. Power, said in a telephone interview from Shanghai that the executives' remarks here represented a shift in the position of the Chinese auto industry.
 ''This is the first I've heard of it,'' he said, adding that ''as the market slows down, Chinese automakers are going to face competition as they never have before.''
 Lots across China became increasingly crowded with unsold cars as sales were slightly lower in August and September than a year earlier. Yet manufacturers unexpectedly increased their shipments of new vehicles to dealerships last month by 10 percent compared with a year earlier, seeking to keep new factories busy and avoid layoffs.
 Retail sales figures for October are due this week, and are likely to show a further decline that could set off another round of price cuts in a market where discounting is already becoming increasingly common.
 Detroit has repeatedly found that raising production in the face of weak retail sales is a recipe for financial trouble, and there is little reason to think that will be different in China.
 The Chinese auto industry faces several threats simultaneously. Weakening economic growth, falling real estate prices and a yearlong plunge in the stock market have made consumers leery of spending money. Fuel prices in China are still high despite the recent decline in world oil prices. And Chinese auto exports, mostly to developing countries in Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America, are starting to crumble.
 China's car industry is already bigger than Japan's, and is approaching in sales the industries of the United States and all of Europe. China is on track to sell 10 million vehicles this year, while demand in the United States is dropping toward 14 million vehicles. 
 Automobiles have played a central role in Beijing's recent plans to move up the manufacturing chain, from making cheap goods that require unskilled or low-skilled workers to more advanced products. 
 To that end, the Chinese government has provided considerable help to China's nascent auto industry with research and development spending, as well as loans from state-owned banks.
 But there is some disagreement within the Chinese auto industry now about how the government can be most helpful. 
 Some companies, like Geely, are looking for more government grants to help them develop hybrid gasoline-electric cars and other cutting-edge technologies for which research spending may be cut if sales do not recover.
 But Zheng Qinghong, the general manager of Guangzhou Auto, one of China's largest and fastest-growing automakers, said that the Chinese industry needs the government to help consumers become enthusiastic again about buying cars. Retail sales have dipped a couple percentage points to 750,000 a month; sales were still rising at an annual pace of 24 percent a year ago. ''The best way is to boost growth in demand'' for cars, through steps like lower car taxes and lower fuel prices, he said in an interview.
 Western multinationals would probably benefit at least indirectly from any government initiative to help China's auto industry, because Western companies are required to do business through joint ventures with Chinese automakers, most of which are partly or entirely government owned. 
 Jeffrey Shen, the chief executive and president of one of these joint ventures, the Changan Ford Mazda Automobile Company, said that he did not know how the government would help, but that some steps were inevitable. ''I'm sure it will come,'' he said, with both extra assistance for research and greater availability of loans.
 The renewed willingness of state-owned banks to lend money to the auto industry this autumn is in contrast with the United States, where General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have found banks and other investors leery of lending to them.
 Government-mandated lending quotas, not interest rates, tend to be the most important limit on bank lending in China. Regulators have begun easing the quotas this fall after four years of fairly tight quotas imposed in an effort to control the growth of the money supply and limit inflation. 
 Direct loans from the government of the sort under discussion in Washington are not needed in China, Mr. Zheng said. ''For now, the Chinese auto industry doesn't need saving'' in the same way as the American industry, he said.
 Chinese automakers began facing real difficulties only in the third quarter, and have not yet released results for that period; many release their results only twice a year.
 Gas prices have not fallen in China because the government pushed up regulated retail gasoline and diesel prices at service stations to more than $3 a gallon over the last year, but has not lowered retail prices as oil prices have plunged. 
 The government is trying to encourage energy conservation and allow oil refiners to recover financially from sometimes being forced to sell gasoline and diesel below cost earlier this year during the spike in oil prices.
 China's top three export markets for fully assembled vehicles are Russia, Ukraine and Vietnam, all of which are struggling with the global financial crisis.
 Great Wall Motor has had a 40 percent plunge in its monthly exports to Russia in the last three months, said Steven Wang, the deputy manager of the company's international trade division. But Great Wall Motor has still managed to avoid any layoffs because domestic sales remain strong enough to maintain employment, Mr. Wang said.
 With China's largest automakers involved in joint ventures with American automakers, and with the entire Chinese auto industry now seeking its own forms of government help as well, criticism of any bailout for Detroit has been muted. Producers elsewhere in Asia, facing declining markets at home as well, have also been hesitant to criticize.
 ''We support vigorous competition in the automotive market place and recognize there may be extraordinary situations when such a vital sector of the American economy may require unprecedented actions to assure its long-term viability and a healthy American economy which benefits everyone,'' said Jake Jang, a spokesman for Hyundai Motor in South Korea.
 But managers at some of the smaller Chinese manufacturers, especially those with hopes of entering the American market some day, are unhappy about the prospect of assistance for Detroit from Washington.
 ''If G.M., Ford and Chrysler get a lot of support from their government, it's not fair,'' said Gordon Chen, the international business manager of Changfeng Motor, which has displayed cars at the last two Detroit auto shows in preparation for entering the American market in 2011 or 2012.

HEADLINE: Convertible Debt Is Hanging Heavy

BYLINE: By ROBERT CYRAN and JEFF SEGAL

 BODY:
Technology companies have issued gobs of convertible debt to raise financing in recent years. These securities, loans that convert to equity, are starting to come due, putting the companies in a bind. Investors who own them probably won't want to convert them into shares, so the companies will probably have to pay the debt off or refinance it. But the former would drain precious cash, while the latter is absurdly expensive.
For years, the match seemed perfect. Companies ranging from Micron, the memory giant, to Anadigics, a niche chip maker, needed cash upfront to develop products. Because they had few assets to offer as collateral, conventional debt was often too expensive. But tech companies could promise future profit, and their stocks are typically volatile. Those factors make stock options valuable. Convertibles are essentially bonds with these options attached, so the companies could issue them with low interest rates. 
This is no longer the case. At least 11 tech outfits have convertible bonds maturing in the next 16 months. But their stocks are mostly trading below the prices at which investors would profit from swapping their debt into shares, so the companies will probably have to repay the instruments.
Take Rambus, a California-based chip technology firm with $160 million of convertible debt coming due at the beginning of 2010. Its stock would need to more than triple for the conversion option to be in the money. The company does have $378 million in cash on hand, but its operations have lost money for four consecutive quarters. Others in similar straits include the chip equipment producer Kulicke & Soffa and Mindspeed Technologies, a telecom equipment firm.
Compounding the problem, the hedge funds that used to account for as much as 70 percent of demand for convertible securities have been hurt by volatile markets and bans on selling stocks short. So tech companies will find it hard to refinance their maturing converts with new ones.
This leaves tech companies in a pickle. For many, the alternatives are unpalatable. Some can issue debt, but the cost in today's market is likely to be prohibitive. They don't want to issue stock at current depressed prices, either.
Mindspeed and others are buying back their converts and angling for a discount. But prices can shoot up when investors realize issuers have their backs to the wall. A company can try to drum up cash by selling assets, but this is a buyer's market. Or a firm can put itself up for sale. Even if current valuations appear low, acting quickly may make sense since they could go lower still as refinancing deadlines approach.
Many tech companies appear to be hunkering down as best they can by cutting costs and selling assets. Unfortunately, signs that technology-related demand fell sharply in October mean these stopgap measures may not be enough. If conditions don't improve, maturing convertible debt may push some of these companies into suitors' arms -- or over the edge.
Wary of Paper Jams
A slowing economy has torpedoed technology-related demand. Hewlett-Packard appears to be an exception: its quarterly results show the firm is chugging along smoothly, thanks to the cost-cutting programs of Mark Hurd, the chief executive. But the party may not last much longer.
Intel and Cisco, two tech industry bellwethers, both cut revenue guidance for next quarter by more than 10 percent. And global PC sales for 2009 may fall 3 percent, according to Citigroup analysts.
In contrast, H.P.'s $33.6 billion of revenue in its fourth quarter handily beat Wall Street's expectations, and it forecast good sales growth next year. That pleased investors, who sent its stock up 14 percent.
Mr. Hurd's no-nonsense approach played a part. He promised 24,000 job cuts following the recently-closed merger with E.D.S. And a companywide holiday shutdown was extended an additional week. Troubles at Dell and Sun Microsystems probably haven't hurt H.P., either.
Yet most tech earnings, H.P.'s included, are heavily linked to revenue growth or shrinkage. Falling demand will hit its profits sooner or later, and Mr. Hurd's efficiency drive may also be reaching its limits. Continuing its habit of buying other companies would bolster revenues, but might make the company unwieldy.
H.P.'s stock is currently trading at less than nine times next year's expected earnings. This appears reasonable. But with demand falling, Mr. Hurd can't afford to slip.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Gives Fresh Food To Help Combat Hunger

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Responding to the economic downturn, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. plans to give more than 90 million pounds of fresh food annually to the nation's largest nonprofit organization addressing hunger, Feeding America. 
 The program, which is being formally announced on Wednesday, comes as food banks across the nation are reporting increased demand, though Margaret McKenna, president of the Wal-Mart Foundation, which oversees the company's giving program, said the gift would continue far beyond the immediate crisis.
 ''We are a strong company, and we share what we have with people in need,'' Ms. McKenna said. 
 The company will not seek a tax deduction for its gift, she said, and thus could not estimate its dollar value.
 Wal-Mart's annual donation will account for more than 4 percent of the roughly 2.2 billion pounds Feeding America, formerly known as America's Second Harvest, distributed last year. Vicki Escarra, president and chief executive of the organization, said it planned to increase that amount to 3 billion pounds a year over the next four years.
 Feeding America works with grocery chains like Kroger, Supervalue and Wal-Mart, which provide 280 million pounds of food a year, Ms. Escarra said. ''This is food that would otherwise be wasted but is very, very valuable to the people who use our food banks,'' she said.
 A survey of Feeding America's network of food banks about seven months ago showed that demand for their services had risen by about 20 percent.
 Handling so much fresh food from Wal-Mart poses challenges.
 Wal-Mart provided money to Feeding America to buy freezer trucks and prepare food banks to receive a much higher volume of fresh food. It also dispatched Wal-Mart employees to build shelving and install lighting suitable for the food it would be donating.
 ''A lot of donated food is canned goods or bakery items, but we were interested in seeing how we could provide protein and fresh produce, which is a very different task,'' Ms. McKenna said. ''We had to figure out how to fast freeze meat and poultry, even dairy, to ensure that we were not just giving away food but giving away food in a manner that it would be safe.''
 The program was tested in 594 Sam's Club stores this year, and Wal-Mart learned that it could get most of the food out of the stores and onto family tables in less than 24 hours, for a waste rate of less than 1 percent.
 Ms. Escarra said the need for fresh food was enormous. ''These are things many of our clients simply can't afford,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Plunge in October

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Producer prices plunged a record amount in October as energy prices fell by the largest amount in 22 years.
 The Labor Department said Tuesday that wholesale prices dropped 2.8 percent in October, the biggest one-month decline on records that go back more than 60 years. The previous record was a 1.6 percent fall in October 2001, the month after the terrorist attacks. 
 The overall decline in the department's Producer Price Index was bigger than the 1.8 percent drop that analysts had expected. However, core inflation, which excludes energy and food, was not as restrained, rising by a bigger-than-expected 0.4 percent.
 The 0.4 percent rise in core inflation was attributed partly to special factors and did not alter the view that plunging energy prices and a sharply slowing economy were combining to reduce inflation pressures.
 The 2.8 percent overall decrease was the third straight month that wholesale prices have fallen.
 Many economists believe the economy has fallen into a recession that could be the worst downturn in more than two decades. The expectation is that falling inflation pressures will give the Federal Reserve room to cut interest rates further to combat the downturn.
 The Fed cut interest rates by a half-point in a coordinated move with other central banks on Oct. 8 when the turmoil in financial markets was gaining intensity and followed with another half-point reduction on Oct. 29.
 That pushed the target rate for the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge one another, down to 1 percent, matching a low recorded only once before in the last half-century.
 Many economists believe the Fed will cut the funds rate again when officials hold their last regular meeting of the year on Dec. 16.
 Tuesday's report showed that energy prices dropped 12.8 percent in October, the biggest one-month fall since a 14 percent decline in July 1986.
 All types of energy showed big declines, with gasoline falling by a record 24.9 percent, surpassing the old mark of a 22.1 percent drop in March 1986.
 Home heating oil prices were down 9.6 percent, natural gas intended for home uses fell 5.9 percent, and liquefied petroleum gas dropped 27.6 percent, the biggest decline in more than three decades.
 Food costs edged down 0.2 percent as declines in the price of milk and meats offset a big jump in vegetable prices.
 Excluding food and energy, the 0.4 percent increase in core prices reflected higher costs for light trucks, the category that includes sport utility vehicles. The price of tires, civilian aircraft and malt beverages also were higher, although the cost of passenger cars fell 1.7 percent.

 BODY:
PUBLISHED DAILY,
 But Few Notice
 How does one apprehend the vastness of the behemoth that governs the city, an entity that spends $50 billion a year -- more than many countries -- on things like hospitals and horse pellets? 
 One way is to leaf through The City Record, one of the oldest and most obscure daily newspapers in New York, with a circulation of 1,400. The city has published it since June 24, 1873, to post information on city matters, including hearings, meetings, court notices and property dispositions. 
 The Record carries no advertisements or conventional news, and 135 years after its first printing, it still comes out each weekday except legal holidays. The single-copy price is $4, and $5 by mail, but it is distributed mainly by subscription, at $500 a year, by the city's Department of Citywide Administrative Services.
 The Public Hearings and Meetings section led Friday's edition. There was also news of various City Council hearings, one on a plan for a new garage to store road salt. 
 In the Procurement section, the Department of Aging was seeking a firm to run ''congregate programs for older adults'' at senior centers. Hunter College sought a ''transmission electron microscope with an accelerating voltage of approximately 200 kilovolts minimum.''
 Mark Daly, a spokesman for administrative services, said The Record is distributed to government officials, public libraries and the news media. 
 The city moved procurement listings online in 2002, leading to a drop in print circulation. The Web page gets roughly 18,000 views a month, and the agency wants to move more listings online, Mr. Daly said. He declined a request for a brief visit to the Lower Manhattan newsroom, which has a staff of five, nor would he provide the publishing cost.
 The paper was created to keep an eye on city business after the Tammany Hall era and had its own scandal in 1910 with mismanaged funds totaling $410,000 a year. 
 In a 1957 profile, The New York Times said the calm of the newsroom was shattered just once, when Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia's name was misspelled: ''Apparently, the mayor did not read the paper that day, because he did not complain.''
 That seems to be a tradition. Former Mayor Edward I. Koch said he never looked at it. ''Lots of people read it,'' he said last week, ''just, not normal people.''

HEADLINE: Asian Banks, Once Thought Safe From Crisis, Are Now Hurting

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Bankers in Asia had been largely immune to the fallout from the global financial crisis. But as the economic malaise consumes country after country, those jobs are no longer viewed as safe.
 On Tuesday, the British banking giant HSBC announced that it would cut 500 jobs in Asia. And Citigroup's roughly 50,000 employees in Asia were faced with the reality that some of job cuts announced Monday could hit them.
 In addition, Mitsubishi UFJ reported that its profit had plummeted 61 percent in the three months that ended Sept. 30. The bank made no comments about any possible job cuts, but the weak report highlighted how Japan's banks were being squeezed. 
 Strong growth in most Asian economies and a lack of exposure to the subprime mortgage market have helped shield Asian banks from the large number of layoffs of those on Wall Street and in London. But Asian banks are coming under pressure as the crisis drags on.
 ''The financial crisis is well and truly here now,'' said Andrew Oliver, managing director at Profile Search and Selection, an executive search firm in Hong Kong.
 So far, Tokyo has been less affected by job cuts than other major financial centers, mainly because the Japanese banks have appeared comparatively healthy.
 However, Japan and Hong Kong slipped into recession during the third quarter of this year, data released in recent days showed, while the sharp fall in the stock markets this year also has taken its toll on Japanese banks.
 ''As one of the world's financial centers and with the Japanese economy sliding into recession, Tokyo will inevitably feel the effects of the intensifying turmoil in global financial markets,'' said Matt Robinson, an economist at Moody'sEconomy.com in Sydney. 
 At HSBC, most of the 500 job cuts in Asia are planned for Hong Kong, where the unemployment rate in the financial capital edged up to 3.5 percent from August through October, from 3.4 percent in the July through September period, figures released Tuesday showed.
 Citigroup also shocked the financial industry this week when it said it would lay off 52,000 employees, or 14 percent of its global work force, much more than the roughly 25,000 jobs cuts the bank had previously announced.
 Citigroup declined to provide a regional breakdown on the job cuts on Tuesday. But most of the losses will be focused on the United States, leaving Asia-Pacific relatively unscathed, a person with direct knowledge of the situation said. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because affected employees have not yet been notified.
 The sheer magnitude of the losses announced by Citigroup late on Monday drove home the message about how the global financial industry is being dragged down. 
 Likewise, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse, which have also recently announced job losses -- though on a smaller scale than at Citigroup -- would not provide any geographical breakdowns, officials at the banks in Hong Kong said on Tuesday.
 Most of the Asia-based jobs at Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street stalwart that collapsed in mid-September, are safe since Nomura took over the bank's Asian operations and some 2,600 staff members. And job losses on the back of the collapse of Bear Stearns also were limited, because the bank only had 500 employees in Asia when JPMorgan acquired it.
 This month, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group, based in Melbourne, said it would cut more than 500 jobs to contain costs. And DBS, based in Singapore, said it would eliminate 900 jobs, or 6 percent of its work force, in Singapore and Hong Kong after a steep fall in quarterly profit.
 Recruiting firms like Michael Page, Robert Walters and Profile Search and Selection all report that they have received considerably more resumes from potential job candidates in recent months.
 Most inquiries ''have come from people who have already been laid off or from those who see a lay off as imminent,'' said David Swan, director of financial services at Robert Walters in Tokyo. ''The sentiment of those who are currently employed has become much more conservative, and we see very few employed people seeking new opportunities in the finance industry.''
 Statistics of the number of job losses in the sector in Asia are hard to come by. Still, Mr. Swan estimates that ''most of the major foreign institutions in Tokyo appear to have cut around 10 percent of staff numbers, which equates to about 100 to 200 on average per company.''
 With all this, there are widespread expectations -- in Asia as much as in the United States and Europe -- that bonuses will be minimal. ''At this stage, most people in the finance industry are expecting little to no bonus for 2008,'' said Mr. Swan. 
 Job losses are also increasing in Sydney and Melbourne, where several financial institutions are making large cut backs. The unemployment rate in New South Wales jumped to 5.2 percent last month, from 4.8 percent, in part because of the downturn in Sydney's financial sector.
 ''I have been here during the Asian financial crisis, the downturn during SARS and the dot-com bubble bursting, and the feeling is very similar now,'' said Mr. Oliver of the Profile Search and Selection recruitment firm.
 But some recruiters are hiring for certain strategic positions in Asia.
 ''Not everything is doom and gloom,'' said Dan Chavasse, managing director for Greater China and Southeast Asia at Michael Page International in Hong Kong. ''There are job opportunities out there, especially in areas like compliance, auditing and product control, where the need for quality staff is higher than ever before.''

HEADLINE: Australian Navy Grants 2-Month Holiday Leave

BYLINE: By MERAIAH FOLEY

DATELINE: SYDNEY, Australia 

 BODY:
Australian sailors have received an early Christmas gift with the announcement that all non-essential naval staff will be placed on two months' paid leave over the holidays. 
 Instead of swabbing the decks and polishing the brass, most of Australia's roughly 13,000 naval personnel will be allowed to enjoy the lazy days of their southern hemisphere summer break, which begins Dec. 3.
 The initiative, announced Tuesday by Defense Minister Joel Fitzgibbon, is part of reforms designed to make Australia's navy a more family-friendly employer. 
 Australia's defense forces, like many industries, have suffered from a shortage of skilled workers over the past 15 years as the local economy boomed. Competition from the mining sector and a shift in workers' attitudes away from lifetime careers have made recruiters' jobs more difficult.
 But a new program, known as New Generation Navy, is looking at ways to make the navy a kinder, gentler place to work, with better child care services and flexible conditions for working parents. 
 Of course, the husbands and wives of the Australian Navy will still have to endure long separations at sea, but they may soon be better rewarded for their sacrifices. 
 Mr. Fitzgibbon said the government plans additional benefits for navy staff next year. 
 The government regards the recruitment and retention of staff as ''the single biggest challenge'' facing its defense forces over the next decade. Eleven percent of navy staff quit each year and only 73 percent of annual recruitment targets are met, according to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper on Tuesday. 
 ''We can invest billions in capability -- warships and fast jets, et cetera -- but they're not much use to us if we don't have the people to man them,'' Mr. Fitzgibbon told national radio. The extended Christmas break is an ''interim'' measure designed to relieve staff exhausted from covering a 2,020 personnel shortfall, but may become a permanent fixture, Mr. Fitzgibbon said.
 ''There's no reason why we can't have a longer stand-down period each Christmas,'' he said. ''We're looking at all sorts of ways of encouraging people to stay.'' 
 Navy ships will continue to patrol Australia's 10,000-plus kilometers of coastline, and around 500 sailors and officers will remain on active duty in the Persian Gulf and other parts of the Middle East, helping with the U.S.-led mission in Iraq. 
 ''Australia's national security remains our first priority,'' Australia's deputy naval chief, Rear Adm. Davyd Thomas, said in a statement. ''Our ships will continue to undertake border protection duties and meet our commitments in the Middle East.''

HEADLINE: A Sea of Unwanted Imports

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: LONG BEACH, Calif. 

 BODY:
Gleaming new Mercedes cars roll one by one out of a huge container ship here and onto a pier. Ordinarily the cars would be loaded on trucks within hours, destined for dealerships around the country. But these are not ordinary times.
 For now, the port itself is the destination. Unwelcome by dealers and buyers, thousands of cars worth tens of millions of dollars are being warehoused on increasingly crowded port property.
 And for the first time, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, and Nissan have each asked to lease space from the port for these orphan vehicles. They are turning dozens of acres of the nation's second-largest container port into a parking lot, creating a vivid picture of a paralyzed auto business and an economy in peril.
 ''This is one way to look at the economy,'' Art Wong, a spokesman for the port, said of the cars. ''And it scares you to death.'' 
 The backlog at the port is just part of a broader rise in the nation's inventories, which were up 5.5 percent in September from a year earlier, according to the Commerce Department. The car industry has been hurt particularly, with sales down nearly 15 percent this year. General Motors has said it would run out of operating cash by the end of the year if it does not receive a government bailout. 
 But the inventory glut in Long Beach is not limited to imported cars. There has also been a sharp drop in demand for the port's single largest export: recycled cardboard and paper products.
 This material typically goes to China, where it is used to make boxes for new electronics and other products that are sent back to the United States. But Chinese factories reacting to sharply falling demand are slowing production, so they need less cardboard. Tons of paper are piling up recycling businesses around the port, the detritus of economies on hold.
 Long Beach is an important port, particularly for the West. It is where imported products arrive and filter through the tributary of trucks, trains and retailers into the hands of consumers. But now, products are just sitting. 
 ''We're supposed to move things, not store them,'' Mr. Wong said.
 Roughly 20 percent of the nation's container imports last year came through Long Beach, putting it close behind the largest container port, Los Angeles. This year, shipping volume at Long Beach is down 10 percent from 2007, and nearly all major ports around the country have seen similar declines. Veteran port workers say the slowdown since mid-October is like nothing they have ever seen. And it is having a cascading impact on other businesses and workers.
 In the 150-acre terminal where Toyotas are unloaded, there is a sea of Corollas, Camrys and RAV4s. The mere presence of so many cars is not unusual, given that Toyota brings in 250,000 cars a year in biweekly shipments. But in a sign that something is amiss, dozens of tractor-trailers that transport new cars to dealers sat empty last week amid the rows of Toyotas.
 Kurt Golledge, 48, was one of just two truckers loading his green, 75-foot-long hauler with cars last week. Mr. Golledge said eight of his colleagues were laid off this month because Toyota dealers did not want more deliveries. 
 ''I was dropping cars in Henderson, Nev., about a month ago and the dealer told me: 'Take 'em somewhere else and dump 'em,' '' said Mr. Golledge, who works for a company called Allied Systems. ''All the dealers are telling us the same thing.''
 Auto dealers typically place orders with manufacturers months in advance, but they can modify their orders to receive fewer vehicles. 
 ''The ships keep coming, but there's nowhere for the cars to go,'' Mr. Golledge said. He said he believed the vehicles he was loading would be his last before he was laid off, and he was already considering where he might find a new job.
 While shipments for some items have slowed, the cars have kept coming in at their regular pace partly because the auto factories can take months to adjust to changes in demand. Toyota is wrapping up a deal to use six acres to park cars at the port, and is seeking more space. 
 ''Toyota wants as much as we can give them,'' said Gail Wasil, assistant director of the port's real estate division.
 For its part, Toyota says the higher-than-usual inventories at the Long Beach port are a result of shrinking demand, particularly in Southern California, which is one of its biggest markets. The company declined to say how many cars were at the port or how long they would be warehoused. 
 Toyota has adjusted its output to reflect falling demand, said Sona Iliffe-Moon, a Toyota spokeswoman. 
 Ms. Wasil said Nissan, whose cars arrive through the port of Los Angeles, sought a deal with Long Beach to park its overflow vehicles there. Mercedes struck a deal to use more acres just a few weeks ago, she said.
 Officials from Mercedes and Nissan did not return calls seeking comment.
 The mothballing of cars is nothing new for Detroit, where thousands of unwanted American-made cars have been parked over the last two years at Michigan's state fairground and in lots at its airports. 
 It is more unusual to see a lot at the California port filled with thousands of unsold Mercedeses, most of them gathering dirt on the plastic white film that protects their hoods and trunks. Some appeared to have been stashed at the port for several months.
 Last week, Mercedes delivered around 1,000 more cars to Long Beach on the Grus, a 580-foot container ship.
 ''A year ago, I was looking into buying one of these for my wife,'' said Kurt Garland, the terminal manager overseeing the unloading of the white, silver and black sports cars, sport utility vehicles and sedans. ''Now I'm not. I'm saving money, paying bills, hunkering down.'' 
 Not far away, metal, cardboard, paper and plastic are piling up in the lot of Corridor Recycling. The company takes in refuse from around the country, then bales it for shipment to China. The cardboard is used to make new boxes while used shrink wrap is turned into shoe soles and insulation for sleeping bags and coats. 
 For much of this year, the company shipped about 25 containers a day, each filled with 23 tons of refuse to be recycled. But after the Olympics, demand slowed for recycled metal. In October, demand for everything else took a sharp downturn, and for the last two weeks the company has not shipped a single container.
 ''It just came to a complete stop. Absolutely a stop,'' said Gilbert Dodson, the recycling company's co-owner. ''I've seen it slow over the last 25 years, but this is the worst,'' he said of the current downturn.
 Like his counterparts in the auto industry, Mr. Dodson is looking for extra space to accommodate the growing number of bales on his three-acre property. The recycled goods keep arriving in big trucks, even though he now pays only $21 a ton for refuse he paid $120 a ton for earlier this year, but there is nowhere for him to export.
 ''It keeps coming in,'' he says. ''But no one is buying.''

HEADLINE: An Island of Industry

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
Almost five years ago, Transcon International Inc. leased space in a nearly empty former manufacturing building in the Port Morris section of the South Bronx.
 The needle trade businesses had for years been leaving the neighborhood, which was a symbol of urban blight in the 1970s and 1980s, and the building, on Rose Feiss Boulevard just east of Bruckner Boulevard, had at one time been scheduled for demolition by New York City.
 Now, Transcon, a warehouse and shipping company, occupies four of the building's six floors -- the other tenant is a military uniform manufacturer -- and its executives could not be happier with this neighborhood, which seems to have hit its stride. 
 ''This is a phenomenal little peninsula of extraordinary abilities,'' said Michael Blodget, the chief executive of Transcon, referring to an area that stretches roughly from 149th Street south to the Harlem and East Rivers and the borough's southern border.
 Covering about 40 square blocks and encompassing Mott Haven, Port Morris, named after a port created along the East River by Gouverneur Morris, one of the writers of the Constitution, is one of the few industrial areas of the city that are flourishing.
 Though real estate brokerage firms do not typically keep statistics on the performance of individual industrial neighborhoods, John Reinertsen, a senior vice president at the commercial brokerage firm CB Richard Ellis, said the vacancy rate in Port Morris is about 2 percent. By contrast, the vacancy rate for offices in Manhattan is expected to reach double digits by early 2009.
 Port Morris ''is a very tight market -- it's a tight market for lease, and it's an even tighter market for sale,'' said Mr. Reinertsen, whose company is representing a building being sold by the lighting company Murray Feiss Industries at 125 Rose Feiss Boulevard and 134th Street. 
 Much of that has to do with the loss of industrial space in Brooklyn and Queens to residential conversion, which has driven tenants to the Bronx.
 Port Morris ''is practically the only industrial neighborhood left,'' said Lawrence Adler, a broker with the Tamerlain Realty Corporation, a commercial brokerage firm. ''It's the last of the Mohicans.''
 Part of the area's appeal is its access to transportation. Neil Pariser, a senior vice president of the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation, a nonprofit group that has renovated factories and apartment buildings in the area, said, ''Port Morris has unusually excellent vehicular access for trucks and even good mass transit'' -- the No. 6 and No. 2 subways.
 Served by the Triborough Bridge, the Third Avenue Bridge, the Willis Avenue Bridge, the Madison Avenue Bridge and the 145th Street Bridge, along with two railroad bridges, Port Morris is a prime location for distribution into Manhattan.
 From Port Morris, ''trucks get into Manhattan without paying a toll,'' said John G. J. Ritter, an executive vice president with the commercial brokerage firm Sholom & Zuckerbrot Realty.
 That benefits companies like Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc., which has a bottling and distribution plant at 977 East 149th Street, and FedEx, which operates a distribution center along the Harlem River south of 132nd Street in the former Harlem River Yards. 
 Port Morris is well-located for shipping heavy products, like paper or lumber, by rail or truck from points north and east, brokers said. The New York Post, for example, opened a printing plant in 2001 at 132nd Street between Rose Feiss Boulevard and Locust Avenue.
 The area also has small contractors, food providers and other clean industry, and is experiencing a small resurgence of the garment industry, which is being priced out of the fashion district in Manhattan. ''Ours is mostly assembly work, with some light fabrication,'' Mr. Pariser said.
 That has made parts of Port Morris, especially Mott Haven, prime candidates for rezoning. In 1997, the city designated part of the area as the Port Morris Special Mixed Use District, enabling it to combine light industrial, commercial and residential properties, instead of being entirely a manufacturing area. 
 The zoning, which allows people to live in the same building where they have a manufacturing business, originally encompassed a five-block area along Bruckner Boulevard.
 That move was a successful effort to populate abandoned buildings and combat the urban decay in Port Morris. 
 In recent years, the city has extended the mixed-use zoning to 11 more blocks, and the economic development corporation ''has done a lot of work in terms of even the aesthetics of the area,'' Mr. Pariser said.
 Now, a row of antique stores and other shops stretches along Bruckner Boulevard amid restored 1910 red-brick row houses and apartment buildings, which have more than 300 new apartments.
 A rezoning plan for the southern part of the Grand Concourse, currently under public review, would extend the mixed-use district to even more parts of western Port Morris, Mr. Pariser said.
 ''There are a lot of jobs in Port Morris, so these rezonings are a balancing act -- keeping that industry alive, but also seeing if there is some opportunity for niche residential development,'' he said.
 Mr. Reinertsen said that residential development is not likely to overwhelm industry anytime soon in Port Morris, despite its potential for housing with waterfront views.
 ''It's a tertiary residential market to begin with,'' Mr. Reinertsen said. ''Condos in Long Island City in Queens are not selling, and that's a much more established residential neighborhood, and even Brooklyn is having problems.''
 But for industrial tenants Port Morris continues to be an attractive alternative to Queens or Brooklyn, Mr. Reinertsen said.
 The annual industrial rents run about $10 to $12 a square foot for ground-floor space, a level that ''probably trails Queens and Brooklyn by $2 a foot,'' he said. ''It's cheaper, but it's not really the bargain it was 10 or 15 years ago.''
 While the price advantage of Port Morris industrial space is currently about 20 percent, he added, ''back then it was more like 50 percent, and land was decidedly cheaper.''
 But Mr. Adler said he worried that residential development encroaching on Port Morris could drive industrial jobs out to New Jersey. ''Forget about the jobs going overseas,'' he said. For New Yorkers, ''what about the jobs going over the bridge?''

HEADLINE: Storms on the Horizon For the Golf Industry

BYLINE: By LARRY DORMAN

 BODY:
WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. -- This is the hypnotic time of year in Florida, where the skies are cobalt, the breezes soft and the daytime temperatures hover right around an even-par 72. Behind the massive hedges that surround the lush tropical setting of Trump International Golf Club here, the top 32 golfers from the 2008 season on the L.P.G.A. Tour are loosening up for a run at the $1 million first prize in the ADT Championship season finale later this week.
But framed in the very perfection of this scene is a contrasting picture for the tour, which on Wednesday is expected to announce a 2009 schedule reflecting fallout from the economic downturn that is seeping through the entire sport. The L.P.G.A. will be down two to three tournaments next year and $4 million to $5 million in prize money, said Carolyn Bivens, the tour's commissioner.
''The headline for us, I would say, is that no renewal -- no partner, no sponsor, no contract -- is an automatic renewal,'' she said in an interview. ''That means for us and for just about every other sports organization.'' 
Although golf has long been perceived as recession proof, some involved in the sport are learning otherwise. The L.P.G.A. is joined in this realization by those who make golf clubs and golf balls, retailers who sell them and even teachers of the game. For now, top PGA Tour officials say they have a full schedule and expect to make no cuts in prize money next year. Even if a bankrupt sponsor were forced to pull out in 2009, the PGA Tour has a large reserve fund that could provide a buffer.
''The big question is whether this is in fact another cycle,'' the PGA Tour's commissioner, Tim Finchem, said in an interview. ''If the answer is yes, then it's really a challenge of getting through the down part of the cycle, which we have done before. We are a conservative organization from a fiscal standpoint. We budget carefully, we build reserves against contingencies, and we think we're reasonably well prepared.''
The L.P.G.A., which has been trying to build a stronger financial base, has increased purses for the past three years and will maintain its average purse per event at roughly $1.8 million. Its major concern now is sponsorship renewal and negotiating expanded television contracts for 2010. The Sports Business Daily reported this week that only 5 of the 24 events scheduled in the United States and Canada had contracts with title sponsors beyond next year.
Bivens said events to be gone from the 2009 schedule were the $1.8 million SemGroup Championship presented by John Q. Hammons, which was played May 1-4 in Tulsa, Okla., and the $2.6 million Ginn Tribute, hosted by Annika Sorenstam, played May 29-June 1.
She added that Safeway, which backed two L.P.G.A. events, would pull its sponsorship from the March 27-30 Safeway International at Superstition Mountain Golf and Country Club in Arizona and consolidate it into one event at the Safeway Classic at Columbia Edgewater Country Club in Beaverton, Ore. The departure of ADT as a title sponsor of the season finale was announced last month, but Bivens said the tour hoped to move the event into a 2010 slot as the season opener.
When Finchem announced the PGA Tour's 2009 schedule last week at a news conference before the World Golf Hall of Fame inductions, he paraphrased Mark Twain, saying, ''I'm delighted to say that the demise of the PGA Tour has been overstated considerably.''
Announcing a fully sponsored schedule despite the bankruptcy rumblings emanating from General Motors, which sponsors two Buick events, and the terrible results reported by Chrysler, which sponsors one, was a huge positive for the PGA Tour. So was its announcement that $123 million would be donated to charity this year, money that was produced by the tournaments in 2007.
Then came an Associated Press report on Monday that Buick would not provide courtesy cars to most tournaments next year, the only direct hit from the financial meltdown the PGA Tour has taken so far. Because the expense of courtesy cars for Tour players is handled by each tournament, the issue is a grass-roots problem and not a trivial one because of the impact it could have on the Tour's charitable donations.
Down the line, away from the spotlight of either tour, there are signs of grass-roots fissures in the multibillion-dollar industry that golf has become. According to Golf Datatech, which monitors on-course and off-course retail sales, same-store sales for September 2008 were off 3.4 percent from the same month in 2007.
Although the percentage hardly compares to the monumental decline in the automakers' profits, it set off some early warning alarms, the way a distant ocean buoy measures for potential tsunamis. Overall retail sales in the United States fell by a record 2.8 percent last month.
Larry Sugarman, the owner of golf stores in West Palm Beach and Boca Raton, said he had never seen business so slow in the 21 years at his two locations.
''A long time ago, before I first got in the business, someone told me that golf retail was recession proof,'' said Sugarman, who said his year-over-year decline in October sales was around 9 percent. ''And it always was proven true. Until now. This is different.''
At World of Golf in New York City, the owner, David Braham, said he expected to have a difficult year before the economic downturn. He lowered his forecast accordingly. As a result, he has not been hit as hard as he might have been.
''That said, it is a very difficult environment,'' said Braham, who has twice reopened his downtown store, which nearly was destroyed on Sept. 11, 2001. ''It is hard for our customers, who tend to be either international visitors or people involved in or affected by the financial industry. Clearly, they feel it, and it's reflecting in the number of customers and the number of dollars.''
Braham said he remained optimistic about the coming season, because some products from a variety of manufacturers were in the pipeline to be introduced in the next two months. Still, the season in Florida, which stretches from November to April, is not off to the best of starts.
The impact has been mixed at the Toski-Battersby Golf Learning Center in Pompano Beach, Fla., where the renowned coach Bob Toski teaches along with his business partner, the professional Gary Battersby. The number of golfers hitting balls at the range has increased, but the number taking lessons has plummeted.
''We are probably down about 50 percent from last October,'' said Battersby, who has run the operation for 20 years. ''Bob still does as many as he wants, but overall instruction is way down. We are still doing a lot of business with international players, but on the U.S. side, we have noticed a big drop.
''On the other hand, we've seen more players hitting balls on the range, probably because the expense of playing a round of golf is so much higher than hitting a couple buckets.''
The number of golf rounds played declined in September, according to Golf Datatech. Tom Stine, the co-founder of the research company, said most industry experts expected the October and November numbers also to be down. But, noting that golf retail sales had grown every year but one since 2000, and that 2007 was a record year, Stine said he believed there was not yet cause for alarm.
''People are not going to stop playing golf, and they are not going to stop buying golf equipment,'' he said. ''For a while, they might delay buying that new driver, but they're going to buy a new wedge, or a new pair of shoes, some golf balls, something to get their golf fix.''
A lot of golfers indeed seem addicted to the sport, and they are aspirational.
Finchem runs the organization of players that many golfers aspire to become, or at least to emulate. As such, he knows the importance of sustaining what he calls the PGA Tour's ''value proposition.'' That, he said, is the formula for success that includes ''the demographic of decision makers that we reach, the quality of the branding we deliver, the quality of our TV platform, the business-to-business opportunities, and our long-term relationships with our customers.''

HEADLINE: Two Sides of Retailing Share Dismal Results

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
Of all the categories in American retailing, high-end clothing and home improvement could not be more different. But bellwether chains in each sector of the industry turned in similarly dismal results Tuesday, another sign that shoppers of all types have gone into hiding.
 In separate telephone conferences with investors, Home Depot, the home-improvement retailer, and Saks, the high-end department store chain, said their sales fell sharply in the most recent reporting period. That is consistent with other recent results in the retailing industry, and if the trend continues, even the nation's discount retailers could find themselves in trouble. 
 Home Depot, hit hard by the trouble in the housing market, has been struggling for a while. By contrast, the slowdown at Saks, which is more likely to sell a mink coat than a miter saw, highlights the spreading distress in retailing.
 ''The malaise of retail has moved onto another subsector of retailing,'' said Bill Dreher, a senior retailing analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. ''It started with home improvement retailers and has worked its way through restaurants, moderate department stores, and is now affecting luxury department stores, with Saks, Nordstrom and Neiman posting disappointing results and struggling to keep up with the rate of change in their environments.'' 
 If things worsen, warehouse clubs like Costco and Sam's Club could be next. ''If times get really tough, people start trading down from warehouse stores to dollar stores,'' Mr. Dreher said. 
 Saks lost $42.8 million, or 31 cents a share, for the three months that ended Nov. 1, compared with a profit of $21.6 million, or 14 cents a share, for the period a year ago. (The loss included $10.6 million of expenses related to the shuttering of its unprofitable Club Libby Lu, a chain catering to girls.) Sales at stores open at least a year, an indicator of retail health, fell 11.5 percent for the period compared with a sales gain of 11.4 percent for the same period last year.
 Even at the Saks store on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan -- which usually outperforms the rest of the chain -- sales were softer as New Yorkers reeled from banking problems, layoffs and the plummeting value of their portfolios.
 ''I don't think anybody's doing well in this environment,'' Stephen I. Sadove, chairman and chief executive of Saks, said during the telephone conference. 
 Certainly not Saks's competitors: as previously reported, for the period ending Nov. 1, sales at stores open at least a year were down 11.1 percent at Nordstrom and 14.5 percent at Neiman Marcus. 
 Analysts say the rate of sales declines at luxury department stores has accelerated quickly. And Saks, for one, is having trouble controlling its inventory. The company is canceling some orders and returning others, as well as taking markdowns to lure shoppers. 
 ''Clearly, our consumer doesn't feel wealthy,'' Mr. Sadove said. 
 At Home Depot, profit for the three months that ended Nov. 2 was $756 million, or 45 cents a share, compared with $1.09 billion, or 60 cents a share, for the period a year ago. Even so, that was better than Wall Street expected. Sales at stores open at least a year declined by 8.3 percent, compared with a drop of 6.2 percent a year ago. 
 As with other retailers, big-ticket sales at Home Depot continued to suffer. Special-order kitchens, for instance, were down nearly 30 percent compared with last year. Only one of Home Depot's departments -- building materials -- had sales growth, though it was largely driven by demand for hurricane repair materials. Kitchen and bath, millwork, electrical, lumber and flooring were the weakest categories. Plumbing, hardware and gardening had sales declines, though they outperformed the company's average sales. 
 At Saks, women's apparel was the weakest-performing department. Women's shoes and handbags, which Saks said had ''explosive growth'' last year, were also soft. Cosmetics, fragrances, jewelry, men's contemporary sportswear and men's shoes were relatively stronger. The company's Internet business had sales growth, though it was much slower than in previous months. 
 One problem all luxury retailers are contending with is that lead times to buy inventory are long -- usually six to nine months, according to Mr. Sadove. That means many clothing retailers are stuck with orders they placed early this year, when the economic situation still looked reasonably bright. 
 Home Depot is lucky in this regard. ''Only about 13 percent of our products are imported,'' said Carol B. Tome, Home Depot's chief financial officer. ''That gives us a little more nimbleness in terms of adjusting the inventory.'' 
 Neither Saks nor Home Depot was optimistic about the near future, and both retailers said they plan to slow store growth and offer compelling sales. Saks said it is ordering 15 percent less merchandise for spring 2009. 
 ''Retailers have been setting a cautious tone all along, but now that cautious tone is extending on into next year,'' said John D. Morris, an analyst with Wachovia. ''One could argue this is positive. They're viewing life beyond the holiday.''

HEADLINE: Plan to Redevelop Seaport Is Spurned for the Mass, Scale and Height of Its Buildings

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP and SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
An ambitious and much-debated plan to redevelop the low-rise South Street Seaport with a 42-story apartment and hotel was rebuffed in its current form on Tuesday by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. 
 Eventually, the plummeting economy might have reshaped the redevelopment proposal by General Growth Properties of Chicago, which itself faces an uncertain future. But the landmarks commission got to it first.
 A majority of the commissioners made it clear that they did not find the proposed massing, scale and height of the buildings appropriate to the 19th-century historic district, said a spokeswoman for the commission, Elisabeth de Bourbon. They further objected to the proposal to relocate the century-old Tin Building to the end of Pier 17.
 Since there was no vote, the application is still considered active, and General Growth has the chance to modify it. 
 Michael H. McNaughton, a vice president of asset management at General Growth, said the commissioners' points were well-taken.
 ''We're undeterred,'' he said. ''Today was not a vote. It was a commentary Q. and A. that does not constitute finality in any way.'' 
 He said the company was committed to the redevelopment.
 The redevelopment plan -- a mix of stores, hotel rooms, apartments and open space -- is strongly favored by the Bloomberg administration. SHoP Architects has designed a 495-foot tower, clad in a terra-cotta exoskeleton, rising on new pilings in the East River. A 1980s mall on Pier 17 would be replaced with two-story retail buildings, a four- and six-story hotel, walkways, a plaza, and the refurbished and relocated Tin Building. 
 Within 24 hours of its unveiling in June, the plan ran into strong opposition, beginning with Councilman Alan J. Gerson, who said his constituents in Lower Manhattan were strongly against it.
 General Growth has controlled the retail complex at the seaport since 2004, when it bought the Rouse Company, the original developers.
 Last summer, Mr. McNaughton said the seaport would ''change dramatically from a place where people in tourist buses buy Yankee T-shirts and bonsai trees.''
 But Stephen F. Byrns, a member of the landmarks commission, said he found the seaport to be vibrant on a recent visit. ''I did not see this as a struggling asset,'' he said. ''It reminded me of how incredibly important this historic district is.''
 After the seaport discussion, the commission designated seven new landmarks including Silver Towers/University Village, three concrete towers designed by I. M. Pei that were part of Robert Moses's vast urban renewal program for Greenwich Village.
 The Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation and others have advocated designating Silver Towers since 2003. New York University, whose proposed campus expansion has caused concern in the surrounding neighborhoods, backed the designation, as did Sylvette David, a former muse for Picasso and the inspiration for his ''Bust of Sylvette,'' the 36-foot-tall concrete sculpture that has rested among the buildings since 1968.
 The six other new landmarks include an aluminum-clad low-rise office building by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill at 105-117 East 17th Street and a late 19th-century cast-iron commercial building by D. & J. Jardine at 22-26 East 14th Street.

HEADLINE: Diet vs. Statins

 BODY:
To the Editor: 
 Re ''Cholesterol-Fighting Drugs Show Wider Benefit'' (front page, Nov. 10): 
 Researchers reported that statin drugs cut the risk of a heart attack by 50 percent by reducing inflammation as measured by elevated levels of C-reactive protein. Chronic inflammation may be an important cause of coronary heart disease. What many people don't realize is that comprehensive lifestyle changes also reduce both inflammation and cholesterol levels as effectively as cholesterol-lowering drugs, but without the costs and side effects of these medications. 
 Your article about this study did not mention changes in diet and lifestyle as a viable alternative to a lifetime of cholesterol-lowering drugs. 
 Last year, more than $20 billion was spent in this country on cholesterol-lowering drugs like Lipitor, most of which could be avoided by changing diet and lifestyle. If millions more people are prescribed these drugs as a result of this new study, then the resulting costs will be billions of dollars more per year. 
 This is coming at a time when health care costs -- really, disease care costs -- are reaching a tipping point. President-elect Barack Obama has made it a priority to provide health care to the 45 million Americans who do not have health insurance.
 At a time when the economy is melting down, wouldn't it make more sense to emphasize lifestyle interventions that are both medically effective and cost-effective than only cholesterol-lowering drugs? And the only side effects are good ones. Dean Ornish Sausalito, Calif., Nov.

HEADLINE: An Estimate Of Car Jobs In Jeopardy Is Dubious

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Supporters of a bailout for the United States automakers have frequently cited a statistic that the industry supports one in 10 jobs in the country. While that is an large figure, it most likely overestimates the effect a collapse of one or more carmakers would have on the economy. 
 The statistic seems to indicate that 10 percent of American jobs -- a total of about 14 million jobs, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics nonfarm payroll report -- could evaporate if the three big Detroit automakers are allowed to fail. But that is not actually what the statistic refers to. 
 The figure appears to come from a 2003 study conducted by the Center for Automotive Research on the ''economic contributions of the motor vehicle to the U.S. economy, to a multitude of U.S. industries in retail, manufacturing and service sectors, and to individual Americans.'' 
 The center is a nonprofit research organization with ties to labor and government. The study was commissioned by the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, an industry group. 
 The study concludes that ''new vehicle production sales, and other jobs related to the use of automobiles are responsible for one out of every 10 jobs in the U.S economy.'' The term ''responsible for'' is interpreted quite broadly and covers jobs in steel, glass and electronics as well as those in taxi-driving, travel and advertising companies, among others.
 The study has two drawbacks in addressing the question of how many jobs are at risk if the Detroit automakers go bankrupt. 
 First, the study uses data from 1998 to 2001, and the industry has changed significantly since then. Employment in the motor vehicles and parts-manufacturing sector has fallen, for example.
 Second, the auto-related jobs covered in the report include more than those dependent on the Detroit automakers; they are related to cars sold by any manufacturer in the American market.
 In other words, the loss of a single United States car company would not necessarily dissolve all those jobs that the entire auto industry supports. The failure of General Motors, for example, would not eliminate the entire car-wash industry. If a foreign company could come in to fill the demand left by G.M. with minimal disruption, then, theoretically, car-wash employees would keep their jobs. 
 That is not to say that there would be no ripple effects. In fact, the center has done a more recent study on that question. 
 The study, which came out on Election Day, estimates ''the economic impact -- in terms of jobs, compensation and tax revenues -- of a major contraction involving one or more of the Detroit Three automakers,'' under two separate situations. In both cases, there would be significant short-term shocks to employment, leading to direct and indirect job losses of 2.5 million to 3 million in 2009.
 Some argue that most of these jobs would be recovered, because foreign-owned auto companies would expand their plants in the United States. Others predict that foreign companies would instead expand their production overseas because of cheaper labor costs and because the suppliers that now serve both domestically -- and foreign-owned American plants would be pulled under along with the Big Three. 
 The center's study extrapolates only to 2011 but it finds that 40 percent to 59 percent of the jobs would be recovered by then.

HEADLINE: In Levittown, Old Myths Meet Hard Reality

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE DOWNES

 BODY:
The image filed away in the American brain under the heading ''home ownership'' is an aerial photograph of Levittown, N.Y., the suburb built by Levitt & Sons in the 1940s and 50s in Nassau County, Long Island. Sprawled upon the sandy potato plain is a precisely machined geometry of tidy rows, some straight, some curvy, all lined with little boxes that all look the same.
 Zoom in now, though, and you wouldn't recognize the place. After 60 years, the cookie-cutter Cape Cods have been remodeled beyond recognition, growing dormers, garages, bay windows and second floors. The neighborhood looks prosperous and perfect, except for the supply of empty homes and For Sale signs. 
 Levittown, a national symbol of modest starter suburbia, is a foreclosure hot spot. This may seem to be a problem for overbuilt exurbs, go-go condo zones and McMansion sprawl -- not tidy, solid communities like Levittown, where the American Dream was invented. You'd think. Until you peel back some of the irony, myth and contradiction that have accreted since William Levitt's day.
 Take the idea of an affordable suburb built to propel blue-collar Americans into the property-owning middle class. Actually, Levittown was built for young, white men with families. Single people, people of color and the elderly were not welcome. As late as 1960, with 82,000 people, it was the largest all-white community in the nation.
 You'll find those facts in ''Building Suburbia,'' an essential history by Dolores Hayden, a professor of architecture, urbanism and American studies at Yale. Racially restrictive deeds and bank red-lining conspired to impose hard-core segregation on Levittown. This was typical for Long Island, which was designed to be -- and to an alarming degree remains -- a collection of immiscible islands of white and black.
 And even though Levittown has been held up as an example of nimble, ambitious private enterprise stepping up to solve an urgent housing shortage, this was only partly true. Builders like Levitt threw up houses and pocketed cash but left many of the vital ingredients of a community -- roads, parks, sewers and trash collection -- to others. 
 Levittown is more racially mixed now (it's only 94 percent white, according to the 2000 Census), but it still bears the burdens of its early shortcomings. As a classic drive-and-consume, sitcom suburb, Levittown has no good access to public transportation. Drive out of its lovely winding streets and you're immediately in choking traffic on Hempstead Turnpike. Some experts predict that other, more accessible communities will rebound more easily from the foreclosure mess than Levittown will. 
 Are there any good things to learn from Levittown, especially at this moment in our economy?
 Here's an excellent one. Ask a librarian, Ann Glorioso at the Levittown Public Library to show you the town and she will give you a pile of binders and folders. In one is an assortment of early mortgage applications.
 ''YOU HAVE PURCHASED A HOUSE,'' a typewritten application to J. Halperin & Co., from 1947, says. ''PLEASE COMPLETE THIS APPLICATION AND RETURN TO US WITHIN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO.''
 Scan the rest of the document and you will be struck at the clarity and rigor with which both lender and borrower approached the event:
 ''Item 4. Give the exact type of work you are doing.
 a. If your position has a name or you have a title, give it on this line.
 b. If you have a badge number, list it next to Item 4.''
 Or Item 53:
 ''Give the total annual amount of money you are paying off on moneys owed to finance companies on furniture, automobiles, banks, personal loans, etc. If you have any installments due, the bank requires that we contact you for further information.''
 Historians write that many of Levittown's neighbors feared it would be an instant slum. Sensible underwriting standards somehow kept that from happening, for a long time.
 Too bad Levitt & Sons can't lead the way out of the easy-credit swamp. After nearly 80 years and 200,000 homes, it filed for bankruptcy protection late last year. It was heavily invested in luxury homes in southern Florida and tanked with the housing market.

HEADLINE: Piling Up Monuments Of Waste

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
 Near the intersection of 47th Street and Lake Park Avenue here -- a gateway to the Hyde Park neighborhood that's home to the next president of the United States -- sits an enormous, barely patched pothole. That pothole is a fitting symbol of this country's crumbling infrastructure: its clogged roads, overburdened airports, aging subway systems and failed levees. 
 Now, finally, some help seems to be on the way. The House recently passed a bill that would allocate $18 billion for new construction projects. Barack Obama has signaled that he will sign a version of that bill and probably ask for tens of billions of dollars of additional spending to create badly needed jobs and help fix up America in the process. Money is going to start flowing.
 And yet when it comes to the nation's infrastructure, money isn't the main problem. 
 A lack of adequate financing is part of the problem, without doubt. But the bigger problem has been an utter lack of seriousness in deciding how that money gets spent. And as long as we're going to stimulate the economy by spending money on roads, bridges and the like, we may as well do it right. 
 It's hard to exaggerate how scattershot the current system is. Government agencies usually don't even have to do a rigorous analysis of a project or how it would affect traffic and the environment, relative to its cost and to the alternatives -- before deciding whether to proceed. In one recent survey of local officials, almost 80 percent said they had based their decisions largely on politics, while fewer than 20 percent cited a project's potential benefits. 
 There are monuments to the resulting waste all over the country: the little-traveled Bud Shuster Highway in western Pennsylvania; new highways in suburban St. Louis and suburban Maryland that won't alleviate traffic; all the fancy government-subsidized sports stadiums that have replaced perfectly good existing stadiums. These are the Bridges to (Almost) Nowhere that actually got built.
 They help explain why our infrastructure is in such poor shape even though spending on it, surprisingly enough, has risen at a good clip in recent decades. Spending is up 50 percent over the last 10 years, after adjusting for inflation. As a share of the economy, it will be higher this year than in any year since 1981.
 So if you talk to people who spend their lives studying infrastructure, you'll hear two reactions to the attention that Mr. Obama, Nancy Pelosi and even some Republicans are now lavishing on the subject. The first is: Thank goodness. The second is: Please, please don't just pour more money into the current system. 
 ''The system is fundamentally broken. We send a blank check and kind of hope for the best,'' Robert Puentes, the infrastructure maven at the Brookings Institution, told me. ''We need an extreme makeover.''
 Mary Peters, the current secretary of transportation, put it this way: ''The United States is one of the few countries in the world to make the majority of its transportation investments without first conducting any kind of economic analysis to determine whether those investments will have any practical benefits for commuters or shippers. The results are telling.''
 How can we do better? I think there are three principles to follow.
 The first is that we just need to start trying to do better. Right now, federal funds typically aren't tied to tangible goals, like how much a new road would reduce traffic or how much a new train line would reduce carbon emissions and oil imports. Much of the time, the government doesn't even collect this sort of information.
 That is not the case in Britain and some other counties. As Mr. Puentes points out, projects in these countries are still sometimes based on political horse-trading. ''But at least politicians are forced to stand up, in the face of evidence, and defend a decision,'' he says. ''It's so different in this country, where there is no evidence.''
 One of the best examples is the success of congestion pricing in London. By charging fees to enter the city, the government has vastly reduced traffic. The program, which initially faced skepticism, is now a big hit with the public. 
 In this country, the government keeps on building roads that keep on filling up with cars, because drivers don't bear the full costs of the traffic, pollution, and wear and tear that they create. Just imagine if Congress, as a condition for financing new roads, demanded evidence that they would reduce traffic. 
 The second principle is that we could indeed stand to spend more on infrastructure. Spending may be at a 27-year high, but it's still far from the levels of the 1950s, '60s and '70s, when the Interstate Highway System was being built. As a percentage of gross domestic product, it is below current levels in many European countries.
 All told, government agencies here now spend about $400 billion a year on infrastructure. The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that another $100 billion a year in worthy projects aren't being done. (Of course, if some of the waste were eliminated from current programs, the net increase could be less than $100 billion.)
 Finally, it's important to remember why infrastructure has become a hot topic now. The economy already appears to be in its worst recession in a generation. Without a major stimulus package, it could get a lot worse next year. So now isn't the time to overhaul the entire system. Speed matters.
 But now wouldn't be a bad time to send a message. The current system is so inefficient that even a minimal amount of change would represent progress. If you want your project moved to the front of the line, you should have to come to Washington bearing hard data -- not flimsy boosterism -- about its economic and environmental benefits. 
 And infrastructure doesn't have to just mean just bridges and tunnels. It can also means schools and homes. One intriguing idea is for the government to subsidize basic renovations to make houses more energy efficient. This would have the added benefit of putting unemployed construction workers and contractors back to work. 
 Over the longer term, there are some reasons for optimism. At the Transportation Department, Ms. Peters has pushed for more cost-benefit analysis (without getting much help from Congress). Mr. Obama has called for the establishment of a separate ''infrastructure bank,'' which could potentially make decisions more on the merits and less on politics.
 None of these changes would happen without a fight, for the simple reason that some people and places benefit from the current system. But that fight is worth having. Today, when everyone is talking about stimulus, and big deficits are seen as necessary, government money may be easy to come by. 
 Someday, though, those deficits will have to be repaid, and there will no justification whatsoever for infrastructure spending that doesn't really help the nation's infrastructure.

HEADLINE: Getting to Yes

 BODY:
At one point during a hearing on the bank bailout in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said that he was being misunderstood about why he refused to use any of the $700 billion bailout fund to prevent foreclosures. 
 He has made it clear that he knows the housing bust is at the root of the financial crisis and the economic downturn. But he said at the hearing that using the bailout money for foreclosure relief would violate the intent of the rescue approved by Congress because it would be a ''direct subsidy'' rather than an ''investment.'' 
 Direct subsidy is a synonym for government spending, which the Bush administration seems to believe promises no chance of ever yielding a return. Investing, on the other hand, say in stocks, holds out the hope of getting one's money back. 
 In an exchange with Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, it quickly became apparent that it was Mr. Paulson who did not understand the intent of Congress as expressed in the bailout bill. And in subsequent testimony by another witness -- Sheila Bair, the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- Mr. Paulson's simplistic distinction between direct spending (bad) and investing (good) was demolished. 
 If Mr. Paulson wants to persist in withholding bailout funds for foreclosure relief, he will have to come up with a new set of justifications. 
 Mr. Frank pointed out several sections of the bailout law that direct the treasury secretary to engage in foreclosure prevention. Perhaps the most important of those provisions authorizes the treasury secretary to ''use loan guarantees and credit enhancements to facilitate loan modifications to prevent avoidable foreclosures.''
 There you have intent and even a recommended course of action -- guaranteeing modified loans. It could not be clearer. 
 Ms. Bair, who is pushing a plan to use $24 billion of the bailout fund to prevent foreclosures, pointed out that such spending could yield a far bigger return than the investments Mr. Paulson favors. 
 Under the plan, lenders who modify troubled loans according to specific criteria would be insured against some of the losses they would incur if the modified loan were to default. That would give lenders an incentive to rework bad loans and in so doing, slow the pace of foreclosures and house-price declines. 
 In her testimony, Ms. Bair noted that if the program kept home prices from falling by 3 percentage points less than would otherwise be the case, more than half-a-trillion dollars would remain in homeowners' pockets. The effect on consumer spending, conservatively estimated, would exceed $40 billion. That would be a big economic stimulus, worth nearly double the original ''investment.''
 Congress intended Mr. Paulson to use some of the bailout money to prevent foreclosures. The F.D.I.C. calculations show that it would be money well spent. What is Mr. Paulson waiting for?

HEADLINE: Federal Court Upholds Drug Privacy Law

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL

 BODY:
A federal appeals court in Boston on Tuesday dealt a setback to the pharmaceutical industry and companies that collect prescription data for use in drug marketing.
 Ruling in support of a New Hampshire law, the court upheld the right of states to prohibit the sale of doctor-specific prescription drug data that is widely used in pharmaceutical marketing. 
 The case is a defeat for two large data-mining companies, IMS Health and Verispan. They sued in 2006 to block implementation of the New Hampshire law, which prohibited the sale of computerized data showing which doctors were prescribing what drugs. 
 The law was intended to cut down on state health care costs by eliminating the tool used by drug sales representatives in promoting brand name drugs. By purchasing the data describing which doctors prescribe what drugs, pharmaceutical sales forces are better able to identify which doctors might use their products and be receptive to their sales pitches. They can also focus on persuading doctors who do not write many prescriptions for their products to change their minds.
 The sale of prescription data, in which individual patients' identities have been removed, has become a lucrative industry. The information is purchased from pharmacy chains and the companies that manage drug benefits for employers. 
 Sales representatives -- known as detailers in industry argot -- often visit doctors' offices carrying laptop computers with detailed reports on each doctor's prescription-writing habits. 
 Saying in Tuesday's opinion that the enterprise of buying and reselling prescription information was ''mind-boggling'' in its scope, United States Court of Appeals Judge Bruce Marshall Selya wrote, ''The record contains substantial evidence that, in several instances, detailers armed with prescribing histories encourage the overzealous prescription of more costly brand-name drugs regardless of both the public health consequences and the probable outcome of a sensible cost/benefit analysis.'' 
 The three-judge panel concluded that ''the state adequately demonstrated that the Prescription Information Law is reasonably calculated to advance its substantial interest in reducing overall health care costs within New Hampshire.'' 
 The appeals court ruling overturned a decision last year by United States District Judge Paul Barbadoro of Concord, N.H., that stuck down the New Hampshire law on First Amendment grounds. 
 In a statement, IMS, based in Norwalk, Conn., said it was disappointed with the decision and was evaluating its potential next steps. Shares in IMS fell 12 cents, or 1 percent, to $11.75 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
 Along with Verispan, which is located in Yardley, Pa., IMS had argued that the purchase and collection of prescription data were valuable for public health reasons and, also, that the law infringed on commercial free speech. 
 The New Hampshire law, which was to take effect in July 2006 before it was challenged, was the first state law to specifically prohibit the sale or transfer of information identifying doctors for commercial purposes. 
 Tuesday's decision could also have implications in other states that have either adopted or are considering similar legislation, particularly Maine, which is in the same appellate district as New Hampshire and where a similar law was also struck down by a district court this year. Vermont has also enacted a similar law that is to take effect next year but is also facing a court challenge.
 Such legislation has been urged by doctors who object to the disclosure of their prescribing patterns. 
 The American College of Physicians asked the larger American Medical Association to prohibit the release or sale of doctors' prescribing information. In 2006, the A.M.A. established a registry of doctors who could ''opt out'' of having their prescription data shared with sales representatives. That was part of a voluntary arrangement the A.M.A. reached with the data companies. 
 In sponsoring the New Hampshire legislation in 2006, Representative Cindy Rosenwald of Nashua, said she was motivated partly by high state Medicaid drug costs, which she said had been driven up by pharmaceutical marketing.
 Besides her state, Maine and Vermont, Ms. Rosenwald predicted Tuesday that other states would now take a more serious look at enacting such laws. 
 ''A lot of states have been looking at this and have come very close to enacting it,'' she said, ''and then they've basically said while this is still on appeal, we should just wait.''

HEADLINE: Obama Affirms Climate Change Goals

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama, in strongly-worded remarks to a gathering of governors and foreign officials on Tuesday, said he had no intention of softening or delaying his aggressive targets for reducing emissions that cause the warming of the planet.
 Speaking by video to a climate conference in Los Angeles, Mr. Obama repeated his campaign vow to reduce climate-altering carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by 2050, and invest $150 billion in new energy-saving technologies. 
 ''Now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Delay is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable response.''
 Some industry leaders and members of Congress have suggested that Mr. Obama's climate proposal would impose too great a cost on an already-stressed economy -- having the same effects as a tax on coal, oil and natural gas -- and should await the end of the current downturn. A bill similar to Mr. Obama's plan failed to clear the Senate earlier this year, largely because of concerns about its impact on the economy.
 Mr. Obama rejected that view, saying that his plan would reduce oil imports, create jobs in energy conservation and renewable sources of energy, and reverse the warming of the atmosphere.
 ''My presidency will mark a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs in the process,'' Mr. Obama said.
 State officials and environmental advocates were cheered that Mr. Obama choose to address climate change as only the second major policy area he has discussed as president-elect. In a press conference and television interview last week he said that his first priority as president will be to revitalize the economy.
 The bipartisan summit meeting was convened by Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Republican governor of California, who has been a leader in state efforts to regulate greenhouse gases, even when it meant confronting the Bush administration over its more hesitant approach. Attendees included the governors of Illinois, Florida, Wisconsin and Kansas, who have also been in the forefront of actions at the state level to act in the absence of a national climate change plan. Officials from 22 other states, Mexico, Canada, Australia, Brazil, China, India and Indonesia, as well as United Nations aides and environmentalists, also are taking part in the two-day meeting.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger announced the meeting in September in part to signal to Washington and the two presidential candidates that the states were serious about moving forward with climate legislation with or without Washington's blessing.
 California enacted a sweeping climate bill in 2007 that would have, among other things, imposed strict mileage and emissions standards on all cars and trucks sold in the state. More than a dozen other states adopted the standards, but they were struck down by the Bush administration last December on the ground that the states did not have the legal authority to regulate greenhouse gases.
 ''When California passed its global warming law two years ago, we were out there on an island,'' Mr. Schwarzenegger said in opening the conference, ''so we started forming partnerships everywhere we could.''
 Mr. Obama said that although he would not attend a U.N.-sponsored meeting on climate change next month, he has asked members of Congress who are going to report back to him on what the United States can do to reassert leadership on global climate policy.
 He also told the state officials: ''When I am president, any governor who's willing to promote clean energy will have a partner in the White House. Any company that's willing to invest in clean energy will have an ally in Washington. And any nation that's willing to join the cause of combating climate change will have an ally in the United States of America.''
 Governor Jim Doyle, Democrat of Wisconsin, said in a telephone interview from Los Angeles that he had been frustrated by what he said was the Bush administration's timid approach to climate issues. And he said that despite the current economic crisis, it was important to begin long-term efforts to address global warming.
 ''I think we all wish the economy was a lot better, but I feel very strongly that we can't back away from progress we've made on really important things like climate change,'' Mr. Doyle said. ''I'm looking forward to having a federal government and a president who will provide real leadership and bring the United States into the world on this issue.''

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''How to Fix a Flat'' (column, Nov. 12): 
 As an admirer of the views of Thomas L. Friedman, I must take issue with his critical column about the United States auto industry.
 Mr. Friedman lays the blame for the auto crisis at the feet of management. While certainly there is more than enough blame to go around, the real culprit is the global credit crisis and failed economic and energy policies that have plagued our nation for far too long. 
 Liquidating the companies isn't the answer -- 1 in 10 American jobs depend on the auto industry. What's necessary is providing capital assistance so that the companies can weather the current crisis and have time to carry out the plans they have already begun to develop. 
 History has shown us, with the previous assistance provided to Chrysler, that this kind of plan can work, resulting in a healthier company and a stronger national economy. 
 General Motors' efforts need to be coupled with trade, energy, environmental, health care and other policies that create fair terms of competition, move us toward secure energy supplies, sustainable development, insuring the uninsured and many other areas that are in vital need of attention. 
 Richard Gephardt Washington, Nov. 14, 2008
 The writer, a United States representative from Missouri from 1977 to 2005, is a board member of Dana Holding Corporation, which produces service parts for automotive vehicles. Mr. Gephardt's firm, the Gephardt Group, served as a consultant to Cerberus on labor relations before its acquisition of Chrysler in 2007.

HEADLINE: Treasury Denounced Over Bailout

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., on Tuesday rejected pleas to use money from the $700 billion bailout program to help homeowners avoid foreclosure or to stave off bankruptcy by Detroit's Big Three automakers.
 Facing a barrage of complaints from Democratic lawmakers that he was ignoring the will of Congress, Mr. Paulson dug in his heels and said he wanted to put money only into financial institutions.
 ''The primary purpose of the bill was to protect our financial system from collapse,'' Mr. Paulson told the House Financial Services Committee. ''The rescue package was not intended to be an economic stimulus or an economic recovery package.'' 
 Democrats pummeled the Treasury secretary in response, with some accusing him of carrying out a ''bait and switch'' by discarding his original plan and others expressing fury that the Treasury had allocated $290 billion for banks and insurance companies but nothing for individual homeowners.
 ''The bill is replete with authorization to you, not simply to buy up mortgages, but in effect to do some spending,'' said Representative Barney Frank, citing a four-page list of provisions. ''Clearly part of this was not just to stabilize, but to reduce the number of foreclosures, for good macroeconomic reasons.''
 The clash took place as Democratic leaders in Congress remained deadlocked with Republicans and President Bush over a $25 billion rescue package for Detroit and a broader $100 billion economic stimulus package.
 Mr. Bush and Republican lawmakers oppose the measures, and Senate Democrats do not appear to have enough votes to override a filibuster. 
 As a result, Democratic lawmakers increasingly predict that they will have to wait until January, when President-elect Barack Obama takes office and Democrats attain a nearly filibuster-proof majority in the Senate.
 Since Mr. Bush passed the bailout law six weeks ago, the Treasury has allocated about $250 billion for banks and $40 billion as part of the bailout for the American International Group, the insurance conglomerate. 
 Mr. Paulson acknowledged that he had the authority to use bailout money for homeowners, but he insisted that the money should go toward ''investment'' in financial institutions rather than ''spending'' on rescue efforts.
 ''We have seen that capital purchases are clearly powerful in terms of impact for dollar of investment,'' he said in his prepared testimony.
 But Sheila C. Bair, chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, warned that the country could expect a tidal wave of up to five million foreclosures over the next two years if the government took no additional action. 
 ''The stakes are too high and the time is too short to rely on voluntary agreements,'' Ms. Bair told lawmakers. 
 Ms. Bair, who has publicly broken ranks with the Bush administration, is proposing that the Treasury use $24.4 billion from the bailout program to help refinance and reduce the mortgage obligations of people who are delinquent on their payments and in danger of losing their homes.
 Her proposal is based on a program that the F.D.I.C. already put in place for people with loans at IndyMac, the failed California bank that the agency took over this summer.
 Under her plan, the Treasury would refinance mortgages for people if it is possible to reduce their monthly payments to about 32 percent of their monthly income. To encourage existing mortgage lenders to settle for lower payments, the government would accept responsibility for half of the losses if the homeowner defaults a second time.
 Democratic leaders have strongly endorsed the idea. ''Further delay in implementing these solutions is unacceptable,'' said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California. Mr. Obama has called for a mortgage-relief program as well.
 The other major point on which Mr. Paulson clashed with the lawmakers was the rescue of the car companies. 
 Representative Paul E. Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, expressed bewilderment that Mr. Paulson would bail out banks but not carmakers.
 ''Do you consider the loss of an automobile company a systemic risk, or don't you?'' Mr. Kanjorski said.
 ''I think it would be something to be avoided,'' Mr. Paulson responded. 
 On the Senate side of Capitol Hill, the chairmen of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler pleaded before the Senate banking committee for a $25 billion rescue package that would come on top of a $25 billion loan program that is aimed at financing the production of energy-efficient vehicles. 
 White House and Treasury officials said that the companies should make do with the loans, which would be made through the Energy Department. 
 Republican lawmakers are opposed to the Democratic efforts, but they gave Mr. Paulson a hard time as well. 
 Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama, complained that Mr. Paulson was unclear about his goals and did not have an ''exit strategy'' for the government. Representative Steven C. LaTourette, Republican of Ohio, lambasted the Treasury secretary for ''picking winners and losers'' and using the bailout program to force the recent merger between PNC Financial Services and the National City Corporation. 
 Mr. Paulson defended his strategy, but said he hoped to avoid committing any more of the bailout money, from the troubled asset relief program, before Mr. Bush's term ends in January.
 ''We have learned that this financial crisis is unpredictable and difficult to counteract,'' Mr. Paulson said. ''We concluded that it was only prudent to reserve our TARP capacity, maintaining not only our flexibility, but that of the next administration.'' 
 Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified alongside Mr. Paulson and Ms. Bair. All three officials agreed that the financial and credit crisis was far from over. 
 Mr. Bernanke said there were some signs that the credit markets were improving, but he cautioned that ''over all, credit conditions are still far from normal, with risk spreads remaining very elevated and banks reporting that they continued to tighten lending standards.''

HEADLINE: Peter R. Orszag

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
As he prepares to take office, President-elect Barack Obama is relying on a small team of advisers who will lead his transition operation and help choose the members of the Obama administration. Following is part of a series of profiles of potential members of the administration.
 Name: Peter R. Orszag 
 Being considered for: Director of Office of Management and Budget, and is expected to get the position. 
 Would bring to the job: An up-to-the-minute familiarity with the federal budget. Mr. Orszag has been director of the Congressional Budget Office since January 2007, and has focused particularly on health policy, since cost increases for Medicare, Medicaid and other programs are projected to contribute to unsustainable budget deficits in coming years. Such expertise could help Mr. Obama, who has promised to expand health-care insurance to more Americans while containing costs.
 Is linked to Mr. Obama by: Occasional meetings on budget issues during Mr. Obama's early Senate years. 
 In his own words: ''Many observers have noted that addressing the problems in financial markets and the risks to the economy may displace health care reform on the policy agenda -- and that may well be the case for some period of time. .... Although this may not seem immediately relevant given our current difficulties, it will be crucial to address the nation's looming fiscal gap -- which is driven primarily by rising health care costs -- as the economy eventually recovers from this current downturn.'' (An Oct. 13 blog entry by Mr. Orszag on the Web site of the Congressional Budget Office.)
 Used to work as: An economic adviser to President Bill Clinton, and before that to Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers. After leaving the White House, he formed an economic consulting company, then became a senior fellow for economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a center-left research organization in Washington. There, he directed the Hamilton Project, which enlists scholars to propose solutions for problems with big fiscal and societal costs, and the Retirement Security Project, which promotes public and private incentives to help improve retirees' income prospects. 
 Carries as baggage: Like other young economists who are in line for economic advisory jobs in the Obama administration, Mr. Orszag (who turns 40 in December) is a protege of Robert E. Rubin, the former treasury secretary. The prominence of such ''Rubinesque'' centrists is vexing to liberals and union leaders in the Democratic Party, who favor some trade protectionism and more domestic spending and oppose the centrists' emphasis on free trade and fiscal responsibility.
 Is otherwise known for: Running marathons and attending country-western concerts. In a June 2007 appearance on CNN's ''Lou Dobbs Tonight,'' Mr. Orszag's paraphrase of a country star's hit song disarmed Mr. Dobbs, who was unsuccessfully pushing Mr. Orszag, as the Congressional Budget Office director, to validate his own views that illegal immigrants impose high costs on taxpayers. ''Well, Lou, as Toby Keith would say, that's not how it is,'' Mr. Orszag said. The host, taken aback by the unlikely allusion from the bespectacled economist, replied, ''You rock on, Mr. Director!'' 
 Resume includes: Born Dec. 16, 1968 in Boston ... graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with master's and doctor's degrees from the London School of Economics ... has co-written or co-edited a number of books, including ''Saving Social Security: A Balanced Approach'' ... has recently became a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of Sciences ... Divorced, has two young children, Leila and Joshua.

HEADLINE: Albany Fails to Reach Deal on Budget Deficit

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: ALBANY 

 BODY:
An effort by Gov. David A. Paterson to close a $1.5 billion hole in the state budget abruptly fell apart on Tuesday after the governor failed to persuade the Legislature to embrace his plan.
 The collapse means that no action will be taken this year to grapple with this year's budget deficit, which continues to expand as tax revenues from Wall Street evaporate. It also means the state could find itself unable to pay some of its bills in the final months of the fiscal year, the governor warned.
 Mr. Paterson complained that lawmakers, whom he had called back to the Capitol for an emergency session to grapple with the problem, not only opposed his reductions but failed to put forward any of their own. 
 ''No one has actually offered any alternatives to my plan,'' the governor said during a meeting with legislative leaders. He added, ''And no one seems to want to negotiate and find ways we can cut our spending now.''
 Mr. Paterson, who was visibly upset, directed most of his outrage at Dean G. Skelos, the Republican leader of the State Senate. ''I never got a suggestion from you,'' he said to Mr. Skelos at one point. ''What I got is a lecture.''
 Earlier this month, Mr. Paterson proposed $2 billion in savings, which he would have achieved by reducing funding for a host of agencies and programs, most notably public schools and hospitals. He also would have raised money by increasing some state fees and tuition at state universities.
 Mr. Paterson's criticisms were echoed loudly by Malcolm A. Smith, the minority leader of the Senate, who called Mr. Skelos's objections to the governor's plan ''gamesmanship'' and ''a charade.''
 The acrimony reflected the bitterness over the recently concluded election season, in which Democrats won enough seats to take control of the Senate for the first time in nearly half a century. Republicans, angry at the governor for campaigning aggressively for his fellow Democrats, appeared unenthusiastic about taking on difficult votes to reduce health care and education spending in what are likely their final days of Senate control. 
 Democrats saw political motives in the Republicans' opposition, saying they were trying to embarrass the governor on their way out.
 But Republicans said they felt rushed into acting on Mr. Paterson's proposal and were not convinced that such deep cuts to public schools and hospitals were the solution to the state's financial problems.
 Mr. Skelos insisted there were other ways to close the deficit, such as adding video slot machines at the Belmont Park racetrack and focusing on economic development to spur more growth and tax revenue.
 ''We could also access a small portion of the rainy-day fund,'' he said. ''Because governor, it is raining.''
 The meeting Mr. Paterson had called for Tuesday afternoon -- which included Mr. Skelos, Mr. Smith, Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker, and James N. Tedisco, the Assembly's Republican leader -- was by turns emotional, contentious and playful. At times, it resembled the shouting matches common on cable news shows rather than a policy discussion among the state's most powerful political leaders. At one point, Mr. Paterson shook his head and said, ''I feel like I'm having auditory hallucinations.''
 Mr. Paterson called the meeting late Monday night after Senate Republicans unexpectedly announced that they would hold a floor vote on the governor's plan. His intention was to put Republicans on the spot, and by pressing them publicly on why they had not put forth any of their own ideas for how to cut spending.
 ''You brought us nothing. You don't have anything on paper to show,'' Mr. Paterson told Mr. Skelos.
 Mr. Paterson had anticipated that legislative leaders would use his plan as a starting point for negotiations, and eventually he, Mr. Skelos and Mr. Silver would come up with an agreement for how to make the cuts. 
 But neither Mr. Skelos nor Mr. Silver responded to the governor with any recommendations. Mr. Skelos suggested putting Mr. Paterson's original plan up for a vote. Mr. Paterson, after saying he would like to see that happen, changed his mind once he saw Republicans were intent on defeating it.
 ''Governor, today the Senate is prepared to honor your request,'' Mr. Skelos said, accusing the governor of not honoring his word.
 In response, Mr. Silver said, ''Mr. Skelos is not interested in passing bills. He's interested in passing the buck.''
 The window to act on some of the proposals that the governor suggested in his plan, like the tuition increase for state universities for the 2009 spring semester, will have closed by the time the Legislature returns to Albany in January.
 ''We are going to have expenditures we might not be able to meet in April if we don't act now,'' Mr. Paterson said. 
 Next month, the governor is expected to deliver his budget plan for fiscal 2010, which begins April 1. He suggested the failure to trim spending now will make drawing up that budget all the more difficult; his budget office has projected a deficit of $12.5 billion in 2010.
 While the meeting on Tuesday was tense for the most part, it ended on an upbeat note with Mr. Paterson expressing confidence that he would be able to work with the new Legislature early next year to close the deficit.
 ''Maybe we've made -- amazingly -- some progress here,'' he said. He is set to deliver his budget for the coming fiscal year to the Legislature on Dec. 16.

HEADLINE: Treasury to Review New Tax Break Plan

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
The Treasury Department's inspector general will review a quiet change in tax policy that stands to give banks a windfall of billions of dollars, a top official said on Tuesday. 
 The formal review is intended to address mounting concerns from Congressional leaders and independent tax lawyers about the process that led the department to announce the obscure tax break, which allows banks much greater leeway to use tax losses from banks they acquire. The initiation of the review was described by a spokesman for the Treasury's inspector general.
 On Sept. 30, a day before Congress passed the Treasury Department's $700 billion bailout package to aid struggling financial firms, the department unexpectedly tweaked the rules and said that a bank was entitled to use all the losses related to troubled loans in a bank that it was purchasing, thus reducing its tax bill.
 The break, which can be applied to deals made years ago, before the financial crisis began, will hand banks at least $110 billion, according to Robert Willens, an independent tax and accounting analyst. 
 For more than two decades, Congress has limited the amount of losses that a company can use from a company it acquires. The restriction was intended to prevent companies from buying and selling other companies solely to take advantage of their tax losses by applying them to their own income and thus reducing the federal taxes they owe.
 Several prominent lawmakers have said that the Treasury Department's action was improper, and a significant change in policy, because it circumvented the basic legislative process behind the nation's tax laws and involved no discussion in Congress, which writes the Internal Revenue Code. 
 The code is administered by the Internal Revenue Service, which is overseen by the Treasury Department. The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., has defended the tax break as proper and properly enacted.
 But in recent days a firestorm of questions has emerged from Congressional leaders. Charles E. Grassley, a Republican from Iowa and the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, wrote to Eric Thorson, the Treasury Department's inspector general, last Friday, asking that he review whether the department had the authority to enact the tax break without Congressional review. 
 Senator Grassley also asked Mr. Thorson to study whether the tax break was improperly devised to benefit certain banks.
 The spokesman for the inspector general said Tuesday that the office was reviewing the questions raised in Senator Grassley's letter and could not comment further on a current matter.
 Other Congressional members, including Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and the Senate Finance Committee chairman, have also written to Mr. Paulson and others with questions about the change. 
 Senator Baucus has also asked that Neil M. Barofsky, the special inspector general who will oversee the $700 billion bailout, look into the tax break.
 Several banks that have recently announced acquisitions will benefit from the tax break, which helps offset their own steep losses in ailing mortgages. Wells Fargo will be able to use $19.4 billion in losses at Wachovia, which it is buying for $15.1 billion. 
 And PNC, which will pay $5.6 billion for National City, will be able to use more than $5 billion in acquired losses to offset its own income.

HEADLINE: Ways Out of Choppy Financial Waters

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. offers up a defense of his erratic performance in the economic crisis (''Fighting the Financial Crisis, One Challenge at a Time,'' Op-Ed, Nov. 18). And to be sure, this is a complex and unprecedented situation. 
 No one can be faulted for tacking as the winds shift or as new understanding is gained. But one glaring defect is never mentioned. Mr. Paulson failed to anticipate this situation in its broad outline even though many credible people had been warning of the coming collapse for at least a year. 
 By contrast, let us not forget the three-page farce of a policy offered up by Mr. Paulson, which had all the earmarks of a term paper written the night before it was due from a summary of Cliffs Notes. What comprehensive rescue package? Three pages is comprehensive? 
 Just what was he doing as the storm clouds gathered in the last year? 
 I can tell you what he wasn't doing: coming up with a detailed set of contingency plans. It hardly inspires confidence in his ability to manage the crisis when he appears to be continually behind the curve. 
 But he has one redeeming virtue: his mandate expires on Jan. 20, 2009, at noon. Orin Hollander
 Jamison, Pa., Nov. 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. says the Treasury's programs ''to restore our financial institutions, financial markets and the flow of lending and credit will determine, to a large extent, the speed and trajectory of our economic recovery.'' Pray that he is mistaken.
 Shoring up lenders, unclogging lending or even stopping foreclosures and the slide in house prices will not alone reverse the spiraling cutbacks in spending, production, jobs and incomes. Only large-scale federal fiscal actions that will reliably boost spending on output -- buying of goods and services -- will do that. 
 The longer we wait to take such action, the deeper the recession will be, and the greater the economic and human damage. All the risk is on the downside. 
 Allowing political convenience, or ill-timed anxiety about deficits, to delay such action until after the Obama administration takes office would be a reckless gamble. Francis M. Bator

 The writer is professor emeritus of political economy at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government.
 To the Editor:
 In his defense of government salvage strategies, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. more than once uses the word ''unpredictable'' to describe our recent economic maladies. Yet it seems that the fiscal predicament we now face was not only predictable but also inevitable.
 If the financial experts had bothered to look up from their statistical analyses, they would have seen the problems that were right under their now out-of-joint noses. Granting oversized mortgages to people with no realistic chance of repayment; letting personal credit card debt balloon for people with no realistic path to liquidity; allowing brokerage firms and their well-compensated brethren to operate with little or no oversight -- what part of this irresponsible behavior was hidden from view?
 Mr. Paulson is seeking absolution for his after-the-fact actions, while sidestepping the issue of pre-crisis culpability. Ignorance of the obvious is never a viable strategy, no less a vindication. Our current economic woes were as predictable as Mr. Paulson's attempt to claim otherwise. Dennis B. Appleton
 Madison, Wis., Nov. 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Henry M. Paulson Jr. states that the housing market is at the root of our economic difficulties. Isn't the logical fix to let the housing market correct itself? Why shouldn't banks and homeowners pay the price for their bad investments? 
 I had been planning to buy a home for four years, but decided that the housing market was overvalued. I kept hearing ''the bubble has to burst'' and ''just wait, the correction is coming'' and even ''you dodged that bullet.'' Today, my down payment, which was diversely invested in the stock market, is ''poof,'' and I have no house. 
 So why keep houses out of reach for first-time home buyers? Aren't we the driving economic force behind pursuing the American Dream? 
 Like the banks, the homeowners and the auto industry, I, Mr. No Homeowner, am also in line. Where's my bailout?
 Patrick Reid Johnson
 Jersey City, Nov. 18, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The group appointed by President Bush to handle the $700 billion bailout is, as I feared, squandering our money. Some $250 billion has been allocated. Let's see the canceled checks, let's follow the money!
 Let's post on the Internet the details of all permutations of this money. How exactly is this money being used? Surely we as the bankers should know where the money is going. 
 If you borrow money from a bank, the bankers want to know how you'll spend it. The bank won't lend you money for a house and stand by while you use that money to buy a car. Shouldn't we do the same and track every dime?

HEADLINE: Bush Takes Steps to Ease Holiday Air Travel Delays

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
In a bid to ease congestion during the holiday travel season, President Bush on Tuesday said commercial aircraft would be allowed to temporarily use military airspace across much of the country.
 At the same time, the president reiterated his intention to have flight slots sold by auction at the three largest airports in the New York region before he leaves office in January, a move that the plan's opponents are trying to block in the courts and in Congress.
 Last year during Thanksgiving week, the president allowed commercial flights to fly in two East Coast corridors normally reserved for military aircraft, a decision that helped head off some of the delays that had plagued travelers in past years. 
 This year, the president said military airspace would be made available not just on the East Coast but also in the Midwest and Southwest and on the West Coast. Commercial planes will also be able to fly in the corridors, particularly during bad weather, during the Christmas holidays.
 ''In other words, we innovated last year to ease the travel; it worked, and now we're expanding that innovation this year,'' the president said, speaking at the Department of Transportation's headquarters in Washington.
 The president said the Federal Aviation Administration, the Transportation Security Administration and the airlines would add workers at airports to speed check-in and boarding, and to help passengers whose flights were delayed or canceled.
 The Air Transport Association, the trade group for airlines in the United States, said last week that it expected the number of passengers to decline 10 percent this Thanksgiving holiday compared with last year, the first dip in seven years.
 But because airlines have been cutting flights, a greater percentage of seats on planes are likely to be taken. As a result, travelers who miss flights may have a harder time getting seats on other flights.
 ''Make no mistake: The airports will be busy and many flights will be 100 percent full,'' said James C. May, the chief executive of the association.
 Congestion in the New York region, home to three of the nation's busiest airports, has been a big source of the delays. To alleviate tie-ups, the administration has added a new departure route from the metropolitan area, capped the number of flights from Kennedy International and Newark Liberty International Airports, and provided $89 million to help upgrade the taxiways at Kennedy.
 The president said Tuesday that the administration would go through with its plan to auction flight slots at the airports in January. In all, 90 slots at Kennedy, 90 slots at Newark and 113 slots at La Guardia Airport would be auctioned. One-fifth of those slots would be auctioned on Jan. 12.
 The airlines would pick half of the slots to be auctioned and the government would choose the other half. Transportation officials said the auctions at the three airports could raise about $150 million, which would be used to expand runways and make other improvements.
 But airlines, some lawyers and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the three airports, say auctions will lead to higher fares because the cost of the slots will be passed on to passengers. The airlines also consider the auctions unfair because they have invested in airport terminals that they may not be able to fully use if they lose slots.
 Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat, said auctioning slots ''perpetuates half-measures rather than making real change.'' The senator wrote a bill that would ban flight slot auctions; it has been included in the economic stimulus package now being considered by the Senate.
 The Port Authority, which prefers an overhaul of the F.A.A.'s air traffic control system, has sought an injunction from the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to block the auctions.

HEADLINE: Detroit Chiefs Plead for Aid, To Little Avail

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC and DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The heads of the Big Three automakers of Detroit pleaded on Tuesday for emergency government aid to stave off potential collapse, but after four hours of testimony, it appeared they had not persuaded enough lawmakers to move quickly on a bailout.
 Senate Democratic leaders said they had not been able to muster the support for legislation that would provide $25 billion to the troubled auto industry from the Treasury Department's $700 billion economic rescue fund.
 There is still a possibility that money may be freed up for Detroit from a previously approved loan program to help automakers retool their plants for more fuel-efficient vehicles.
 But the industry hardly received a warm reception in Washington, despite its mounting troubles. The frantic bid from Detroit for help was laid bare at a packed hearing of the Senate banking committee, in which two of the three automakers said they might run out of money by the end of the year. 
 The cause of their misfortunes was not management mistakes, they said, but the weak economy and the inability of consumers to obtain credit to buy cars.
 The executives from General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler seemed stunned by the general lack of confidence that lawmakers showed in their companies.
 ''We have little evidence that $25 billion will do anything to promote long-term success,'' said Senator Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming.
 The discussions were tense, with the automotive executives on the defensive from the start. At times, it appeared the lawmakers had little familiarity with the deep reorganization steps already taken at the companies. On the other side, the Detroit executives painted a bleak picture of an industry under siege. The chief executives of G.M. and Chrysler said their companies were using up their cash at a rate that could leave them close to insolvency without federal aid.
 ''Without immediate bridge financing support, Chrysler's liquidity could fall below the level necessary to sustain operations,'' said Robert L. Nardelli, the chairman of Chrysler.
 His comments were echoed by G.M.'s chairman, Rick Wagoner, who warned that the rippling impact of the auto industry's cash woes could put three million American jobs at risk.
 He said that a failure by G.M., Ford or Chrysler would rapidly bring the entire domestic industry down. ''The societal costs would be catastrophic -- three million jobs lost within the first year, U.S. personal income reduced by $150 billion and a government tax loss of more than $156 billion over three years,'' Mr. Wagoner said.
 Alan R. Mulally, Ford's chief executive, added, ''If any one of the domestic companies should fail, we believe there is a strong chance that the entire industry would face severe disruption.''
 Despite the urgent tone of the executives, lawmakers in both parties saw little chance that a bailout could be put together and passed during the current lame-duck session. The Bush administration has steadfastly refused requests by Democratic leaders to tap into the financial rescue program to aid the automakers. 
 The Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., at a House hearing on Tuesday morning and again at a lunch with Republican senators, implored lawmakers to oppose using any of the $700 billion financial bailout for the auto companies, which he said would set a dangerous precedent.
 The White House instead has pushed for the auto companies to get immediate access to $25 billion in previously approved loans to retool production plants to make fuel-efficient vehicles.
 For television watchers back home there were dueling news conferences and hearings with carefully sharpened questions and even more carefully rehearsed answers. Behind the scenes, auto executives and their lobbyists scrambled from office to office pressing influential lawmakers to take up their cause.
 Outside the banking committee hearing, liberal demonstrators preached anti-corporate sermons. And a small corps of Japanese journalists tracked the fate of the American companies, rivals of Toyota and Nissan.
 Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and one of the auto industry's chief allies on Capitol Hill, said he still hoped a deal to provide quick access to the $25 billion in loans could be worked out. Mr. Levin conceded no progress on hammering out the details had been made, but said that efforts were being undertaken. 
 Mr. Levin said that lawmakers were considering several approaches, including rewriting the provision that mandates that any subsidized loans go toward retooling plants to produce advanced fuel-efficient cars.
 The suddenness of the cash crisis at G.M. has caught Washington by surprise.
 Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama, the ranking Republican on the banking committee, said he was skeptical that the Detroit companies could sufficiently reorganize their operations and improve their competitiveness.
 ''How is this money going to be used?'' he said. ''Will it be used to improve their business model and product lines, or is this just life support?''
 The hearing underscored how deeply complicated the problems are at the Big Three, which have been losing billions of dollars even as they close factories and cut tens of thousands of jobs.
 It also stirred new criticisms of Detroit's ability to compete in the global marketplace. Several senators called into question the carmakers' vehicle quality, high labor costs and the capability of their senior management.
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, who is chairman of the banking committee and has been generally supportive of aid to the auto companies, gave little solace to the Detroit executives.
 ''Their discomfort in coming to the Congress with hat in hand is only exceeded by the fact that they are seeking treatment for wounds that are to a large extent self-inflicted,'' he said. ''No one can say they didn't see this coming.''
 But the auto executives argued that their turnaround strategies were taking hold just as the economy faltered and available credit dried up for consumers.
 The overall United States vehicle market has fallen 14.8 percent through the first 10 months of the year. However, sales in October plummeted 31.9 percent, mostly because of the lack of available credit for potential car buyers.
 ''There is no great mystery as to why this enormous decline in sales has occurred,'' said Ron Gettelfinger, president of the United Automobile Workers union. ''Because of the overall credit crunch, most families cannot get credit on reasonable terms to finance the purchase of a vehicle.''
 While Democratic lawmakers have vowed to get some type of aid for Detroit this week, the process of producing a coherent and effective package has proved elusive.
 After the hearing, Mr. Dodd was greeted in the hallway by reporters asking him if he ''had the votes'' to fix Detroit. ''Votes for what?'' he said, indicating that a vote on any legislation was questionable this week.
 Detroit's huge financial problems have caused some legislators to question the haste to rush a bailout through Congress.
 ''I am prepared to consider economic aid to the automakers, but providing regular order is followed,'' said Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania. ''And by that I mean, we have a bill we know the specifics of, to have a chance to study it, to have hearings, to have a floor debate, to have amendments.''

 FOR FIRST TIME, MALIKI DEFENDS 
 New Security Agreement
 Iraq's prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, above, went on television to defend a new security agreement with the United States. The speech came six days before Parliament is scheduled to vote on the agreement, which sets a 2011 deadline for all American combat forces to leave. Separately, the Iraqi cabinet announced that it had set a firm date, Jan. 31, for elections in all provinces except the three that make up Kurdistan and the province of Tamim. PAGE A16 
 IRAN DIVIDED OVER U.S.-IRAQ PACT
 Even though Iran still has no official reaction to the new Iraqi-American security agreement, responses in general are many and varied. Conservative politicians and newspapers in Iran have expressed opposition to the pact and urged Iraq's Parliament to reject it. But at least one prominent figure, a senior judicial official, has said Iraqi negotiators did well. PAGE A16 
 THOUSANDS BATTLE POLICE IN CHINA
 A local government's decision to move its administrative headquarters from one city to another has provoked two days of protests, rioting and looting in northwestern China, according to state media and witnesses who said protesters had burned police cars and looted government offices. Riots are not uncommon in China, but as the economy slows, the government is acutely sensitive to unrest. PAGE A10 
 HIJACKED TANKER OFF SOMALIA COAST
 A hijacked Saudi-owned supertanker carrying more than $100 million worth of crude oil was anchored off the coast of Somalia on Tuesday and the ship's owner said it was working to free the ship and its 25-member crew. The owner said in a statement that the company was awaiting further contact from the pirates who seized the vessel about 480 miles off Somalia's coast. Earlier reports had said that the 1,080-foot-long ship, Sirius Star, had been hijacked off the Kenyan coast. PAGE A12 
 COURT ANNULS EGYPT-ISRAEL DEAL
 An Egyptian court ordered the government to stop sending natural gas to Israel via pipeline, saying the 15-year contract was improperly awarded because it was not approved by Parliament. The government said it would appeal the decision, and officials in Cairo and Israel said gas would continue to flow. The case has raised difficult political issues for Egypt, where officials try to balance relations with their neighbor and mollifying public opinion, which is often hostile to the Jewish state.

 SENATOR CLINTON SAID TO BE DIVIDED OVER BECOMING SECRETARY OF STATE
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York has reservations about accepting an appointment as secretary of state in the Obama administration, an adviser to Mrs. Clinton who is familiar with her thinking said. The adviser described Mrs. Clinton as flattered by President-elect Barack Obama's interest but said she was agonizing over the decision. Mrs. Clinton likes being her own boss and is reluctant to give up the independence that comes with that, said the adviser. PAGE A24 
 CUTTING ENROLLMENT AT CAL STATE
 Hard hit by budget cuts, the California State University system is planning to cut its enrollment by 10,000 students for the 2009-2010 academic year, unless state lawmakers provide more money. It would be the first time in its history that the university system has turned away students who met the admissions standards, and the announcement immediately drew strong criticism. PAGE A18 
 BUSH OPENS MILITARY AIR SPACE
 Whether Santa's sleigh will be following the flight plan of fighter jets is unclear, but in a bid to avoid grumpy crowds at airports this holiday season, the Bush administration will allow commercial aircraft to use military airspace across much of the country, a move made last year on the East Coast only. The president also reiterated his intention to have flight slots sold by auction at the three largest airports in the New York region before he leaves office. PAGE A20 
 AARP INVESTIGATES OWN MARKETING
 After a Senate inquiry found evidence of deceptive marketing, AARP, the lobby for older Americans, has hired an outside investigator to look into sales of some of its health insurance products. AARP and UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation's largest insurers, have voluntarily suspended sales of the policies, which pay fixed cash benefits -- often much less than consumers had expected -- for selected services.

 A DISAPPEARING OPTION
 Filing for bankruptcy is supposed to give struggling companies a chance to right themselves. But with the credit markets all but frozen, fewer companies are exercising that option because they cannot obtain financing to continue operating while they reorganize. So as companies shut down, more jobs vanish for good, which means that the economic downturn could be even longer and more painful. PAGE B1

 Daniel and Henrik Sedin are identical twins who both play for the Vancouver Canucks. One has 394 career points, while the other has 393. Their on-ice chemistry has led to whispers among teammates and opponents of twin telepathy.

 LEGAL TANGLES OF 'PROJECT RUNWAY' KEEP IT FROZEN OFF THE CATWALK
 At a time when most TV programs are losing their audience, ''Project Runway,'' the popular reality competition in which aspiring fashion designers face off with their clothing creations, continues to increase its audience.

The joyful score is just the kind of thing Mr. Dudamel thrives on, with its hard-driven ''Diaspora Dances'' and the hints of Latin rhythms and jazz harmonies, and he rode its wilder sections like a loose-limbed champion surfer, Allan Kozinn writes.

HEADLINE: A Resounding Vote for Open Space

 BODY:
Almost unnoticed in the election results was some very good news for the environment -- and for land preservation in particular. Despite the financial crisis, voters made it clear that they want to increase spending on preserving open land, even at the cost of higher taxes. 
 Across the nation, voters approved $7.3 billion in new spending for parks and open-space preservation. Sixty-two of the 87 referendums to acquire or otherwise protect open space were approved. And the support came in rural, Republican areas, as well as in those that lean toward the Democrats. 
 California and Florida said yes to more than $700 million in new spending on open space. In Minnesota, voters increased the sales tax by three-eights of a cent to generate $5.5 billion over the next 25 years for land preservation and environmental protection. It was the largest open-space state referendum in the nation's history. 
 Despite especially tough economic times, New Jersey voters showed that they feel strongly about acquiring open space before it is all eaten up by strip malls and McMansions. The state is reeling from high property taxes, unemployment and a budget deficit. But voters still approved 14 of 22 county and municipal referendums to increase or extend property taxes dedicated to acquiring or preserving open space.
 These votes are an explicit rebuke to President Bush, who failed miserably to honor his 2000 campaign promise to fully fund the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the government's main vehicle for buying open space. They should give Congress a strong push to approve a public lands measure that, among other things, would grant permanent wilderness protection to two million acres of public land.
 We had hoped that Congress would approve the legislation in the current lame-duck session. On Monday, the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, withdrew it from the calendar after Senator Tom Coburn, an Oklahoma Republican, threatened to filibuster the bill. Mr. Coburn called it a waste of money and an unnecessary expansion of federal control over public lands. 
 Mr. Reid said the Senate needed to focus on the economic crisis, but he promised to bring the measure up for immediate action early next year. 
 Old business tends to get lost in the early days of a new Congress, especially when there is a new administration. Come January, we will remind Mr. Reid of his promise and of the voters' clear commitment to preserving open spaces.

HEADLINE: Candidates for Obama's Inner Circle MICHAEL FROMAN

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

 BODY:
Being considered for: An international economics or foreign policy post, perhaps at the Treasury Department, the Agency for International Development or the White House. He is already a member of Mr. Obama's transition advisory council. 
 Would bring to the job: Expertise in emerging markets, sustainable development and alternative energy, as a lawyer, an economic policy wonk and a manager.
 Is linked to Mr. Obama by: Late nights and long meetings at The Harvard Law Review. After graduation, the two lost touch, until Mr. Froman heard that Mr. Obama was running for the Senate and offered assistance. A prodigious fund-raiser, especially among New York's young finance crowd, Mr. Froman introduced Mr. Obama to Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, who has become a key adviser. 
 In his own words:''Creating sustainable economic growth and increasing standards of living cannot solve the region's political and ethnic problems. But they can contribute to stability in the region and create incentives to avoid conflict.'' (From a 2000 Council on Foreign Relations report on the Balkans.)
 Used to work for: Mr. Rubin, like a number of potential Obama appointees. In the early Clinton years, Mr. Froman worked for the National Economic Council, the National Security Council and then the Treasury Department. In 1997, he became Mr. Rubin's chief of staff at the Treasury Department, eventually following him to Citigroup. 
 Carries as baggage: As a high-ranking Citigroup official, Mr. Froman is one of many potential appointees with ties to the troubles on Wall Street.
 Biography: Born Aug. 20, 1962 ... graduated from Princeton, earned a doctorate in international relations from Oxford and a law degree from Harvard ... after law school, he and his wife, Nancy Goodman, moved to Albania, where they ran a legal reform initiative sponsored by the American Bar Association.

HEADLINE: Aide to Obama Seen as Choice For Justice Post

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU and JOHN M. BRODER; Reporting was contributed by Jackie Calmes, Rachel L. Swarns, Helene Cooper, Jeff Zeleny and Peter Baker.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama's transition team has signaled to Eric H. Holder Jr., a senior official in the Justice Department in the Clinton administration, that he will be chosen as attorney general, but no final decision has been made, people involved in the process said Tuesday.
 Mr. Holder would be the first African-American to serve as the nation's top law enforcement official. 
 As a top adviser to Mr. Obama, he has long been considered the front-runner for the job of attorney general because of his extensive record as a prosecutor and a judge and a well-honed reputation inside Washington. Mr. Obama's advisers appear to have overcome concerns that Mr. Holder's involvement in a presidential pardon scandal as President Bill Clinton left office in 2001 might cloud his nomination for the job.
 Word that Mr. Holder was likely to be nominated as attorney general leaked out as Mr. Obama also began settling on other members of his team and signaling his policy priorities upon taking office. 
 Mr. Obama is set to hire Peter R. Orszag, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, as the White House budget director, people involved in the transition said. They said the leading candidate at this point for another top post on the economic team, director of the National Economic Council, is Jacob Lew, who was Mr. Clinton's budget director.
 While Mr. Obama has yet to name any of his cabinet secretaries, his early choices for White House staff positions and the names currently at the top of the list for staff and cabinet jobs suggest that his administration could be heavily stocked with Democrats who served under Mr. Clinton. Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, under consideration to be secretary of state, was said by an adviser to be torn about giving up her Senate seat. 
 In his only public appearance on Tuesday, Mr. Obama indicated that he intended to move rapidly on one of the most ambitious items on his agenda, tackling climate change. Speaking to a bipartisan group of governors by video, the president-elect said that despite the weakening economy, he had no intention of softening or delaying his ambitious goals for reducing emissions that cause the warming of the planet. 
 ''Now is the time to confront this challenge once and for all,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Delay is no longer an option. Denial is no longer an acceptable response.''
 He repeated his campaign promise to reduce climate-altering carbon dioxide emissions by 80 percent by 2050 and invest $150 billion in new energy-saving technologies. 
 Some industry leaders and members of Congress have suggested that Mr. Obama's climate proposal would impose too great a cost on an already-stressed economy -- having the same effects as a tax on coal, oil and natural gas -- and should await the end of the current downturn. A bill similar to Mr. Obama's plan failed to clear the Senate this year, largely because of concerns about its impact on the economy.
 Mr. Obama rejected that view, saying that his plan would reduce oil imports, create jobs in energy conservation and renewable sources of energy, and reverse the warming of the atmosphere.
 ''My presidency will mark a new chapter in America's leadership on climate change that will strengthen our security and create millions of new jobs in the process,'' he said.
 Mr. Obama said that although he would not attend a meeting on climate change sponsored next month by the United Nations, he had asked members of Congress who would be attending to report back to him on what the United States could do to reassert leadership on global climate policy.
 Senator James M. Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who has been a consistent skeptic on global warming science and legislation, said Tuesday that Mr. Obama might be getting out ahead of his own party on climate change. Mr. Inhofe noted that nearly a third of Senate Democrats had opposed the similar climate change bill that came to a vote this year. 
 ''President-elect Obama will face an even tougher sell in the years ahead, with economic concerns remaining front and center,'' Mr. Inhofe said.
 In Washington, Michelle Obama and her two daughters, Malia and Sasha, visited the White House on Tuesday, the final day of a two-day trip devoted to scouting out private schools for the young girls. Katie McCormick Lelyveld, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Obama, said Laura Bush had invited Mrs. Obama for her second visit to the White House -- she and Mr. Obama visited last week -- so the girls could get a feel for their new home-to-be.
 During their trip to Washington, Mrs. Obama and her daughters also toured Sidwell Friends School and Georgetown Day School, two private schools they are considering.
 Members of Mr. Obama's transition team said Tuesday that no decision had been made on the attorney general spot and denied reports that Mr. Holder, 57, had already been selected. 
 People involved in the transition process said, however, that the decision appeared all but certain once the process of vetting of Mr. Holder was completed. If Mr. Holder is selected as attorney general and confirmed by the Senate, his biggest challenge, legal observers agree, will be to restore the credibility of a department that was badly battered by political scandal during the Bush administration. The dismissal of eight United States attorneys in 2007 and other controversies opened up the Justice Department to accusations that it had routinely let politics trump legal considerations. 
 Mr. Holder first met Mr. Obama at a small dinner party in 2004 welcoming him to Washington. The two lawyers, each the son of immigrant fathers, were seated next to each other at the dinner, and Mr. Holder said he was immediately impressed by the new senator. 
 Mr. Holder went on to serve as an adviser to Mr. Obama's campaign on legal issues and served on the two-member vice-presidential selection team that led to the choice of Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. as Mr. Obama's running mate.
 Now in private practice as a partner at the Washington law firm of Covington & Burling, Mr. Holder served as a federal prosecutor, a trial court judge, and United States attorney for the District of Columbia before becoming the top-ranking aide to Attorney General Janet Reno in 1997. He was regarded as a strong ally for federal prosecutors and helped shape Mr. Clinton's program to put 100,000 police officers on the street. 
 His last days at the Justice Department in 2001 were marred by his peripheral involvement in Mr. Clinton's pardon of the fugitive financier Marc Rich, as Republicans sharply criticized Mr. Holder as failing to oppose the pardon and allowing the White House to bypass the normal pardon review process at the Justice Department. 
 Mr. Holder told the Clinton White House at the time that he was ''neutral, leaning toward favorable'' on the idea of pardoning Mr. Rich, whose former wife, Denise Rich, had contributed heavily to Mr. Clinton's presidential library. 
 Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, which reviews nominees for attorney general, told reporters on Tuesday that while he had not taken any position on the prospect of Mr. Holder as attorney general, his role in the pardon of Mr. Rich should be ''a factor to consider'' in any confirmation.
 With the battered economy the most immediate problem facing him when he takes office in January, Mr. Obama interviewed Mr. Orszag in Chicago last week for the cabinet-level job of director of the Office of Management and Budget, people familiar with the transition said. 
 Mr. Obama's budget director will have to scramble to draft a proposed budget to be ready soon after the Jan. 20 presidential inauguration, and to help with the economic stimulus proposals that Mr. Obama has said he will offer after taking office. 
 Like several other candidates for top posts, Mr. Orszag is a protege of Robert E. Rubin, former Treasury secretary to Mr. Clinton, and shares Mr. Rubin's centrist approach to fiscal policies and concern about big deficits.
 Mr. Orszag was also considered for the job of director of the White House National Economic Council, which coordinates the work of the president's principal economic and fiscal advisers. That post is expected to go to Mr. Lew, another Clinton White House veteran who is now chief operating officer of Citi Alternative Investments, a unit of Citigroup, where Mr. Rubin is a director.
 While the economic crisis has forced Mr. Orszag to focus on the $700 billion bailout program and various stimulus proposals before Congress, his emphasis has otherwise been on health policies. He has sought to draw attention to the growing costs for Medicare and other federal programs that are driving the projections of unsustainable budget deficits. Recently, for example, he gave a speech highlighting studies on potential cost savings from preventive medicine and more cost-efficient treatments.

HEADLINE: Mary D. Nichols

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
As he prepares to take office, President-elect Barack Obama is relying on a small team of advisers who will lead his transition operation and help choose the members of the Obama administration. Following is part of a series of profiles of potential members of the administration.
 Being considered for: Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or another environmental and climate-change policy post. 
 Would bring to job: Expertise in environmental issues, particularly air pollution, experience in carrying out policy and familiarity with both state-level initiatives and the inner workings of the E.P.A. As an assistant administrator for the agency during the Clinton administration, her efforts led to the first federal standard regulating potentially deadly fine-particle pollution. Most recently, as chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board, she is leading the efforts to achieve the reduction in greenhouse gases mandated by the state's far-reaching 2006 law, working with regulators, economists and interest groups to administer the state's climate-change policies.
 Is linked to Mr. Obama by: Few direct links, but because of her years in the Clinton administration, she has ties to many of the people involved in the transition, including Carol Browner, the former head of the E.P.A. who has been advising the campaign on environmental issues. She is also close to Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat of California, chairwoman of the Environment and Publics Work Committee.
 In her own words: On using government mandates to ensure emissions reductions from green building practices: ''If buildings are built that draw nothing from the (electrical) grid, but all of the materials in that building were built in China using machines from factories that were all powered by Chinese coal, I don't think we would have made the globe a cleaner, safer place. So we've got to think about life-cycle emissions in a whole different way then we've ever had to do before. If we're not thinking at a truly global level, we're not actually going to save our planet.'' -- Panel discussion at Stanford University, March 4, 2008. 
 On California's efforts on climate change: ''Especially in times like these, we must be extraordinarily mindful of the economic effects of our actions. We know that the economic crisis we will face from unmitigated climate change could dwarf anything we have ever seen. That alone is a compelling enough reason to take swift action. But there's another reason also, which is that developing a new clean energy economy that drives and rewards investment and innovation, creates jobs and serves as the engine for sustainable economic growth is exactly what we need at a time like this.'' -- Speech at University of Rhode Island, Nov. 12, 2008.
 Used to work as: A lawyer and administrator with decades of policy and enforcement experience, primarily in addressing air pollution (she told The Los Angeles Times that she became ''hooked on smog'' early on). She fell into her specialization as a lawyer working for the Center for Law in the Public Interest when, in the first federal test case, she forced a state, California, to impose standards under the federal Clean Air Act. Previously, from 1975 to 1982, she was chairwoman of the California Air Resources Board and a member of the board of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, the nation's largest municipal utility. While at the E.P.A. in the 1990s, she was an assistant administrator for air and radiation and was involved in nitty-gritty negotiations with the utility industry, manufacturers of diesel engines, environmental groups and other government agencies. 
 Also known for: Was one of the first female journalists hired by The Wall Street Journal soon after graduating from college in 1966; served briefly as campaign manager for Tom Bradley, the mayor of Los Angeles, in his unsuccessful 1986 run for governor.
 Carries as baggage: The suspicion of transportation and utility industry representatives, who see her push on climate change regulation in California as evidence of an ingrained pro-regulatory bias. And while she is well known among policy wonks, she lacks the name recognition or political heft of former administrators like Christine Todd Whitman and Michael O. Leavitt.
 Resume includes: Born April 10, 1945, in Minneapolis. ... graduate of Cornell (major was Russian literature, minor in drama) and Yale Law. ... married to John F. Daum, a lawyer who represents Exxon Mobil. They have two grown children, both lawyers.

HEADLINE: Sifting for Bargains at Madrid's Sunday Morning "Rastro"

BYLINE: ANDREW FERREN


HIGHLIGHT: The word is out that Madrid's Sunday morning flea market - known as the Rastro - has grown bigger, busier, and more bustling than ever, with an estimated 25 percent more pedestrian traffic in recent months 

 BODY:
The word is out that Madrid's Sunday morning flea market - known as the Rastro - has grown bigger, busier, and more bustling than ever, with an estimated 25 percent more pedestrian traffic in recent months. Gorgeous fall weather has combined with a global financial crunch to get folks out early on Sunday, either sifting for bargains or selling yesteryear's apparel for quick cash to help with rising mortgage payments. In hard economic times, Spaniards are imminently practical and yet still highly social, so why shouldn't one Madrileo's budgetary squeeze yield another's fall finds, with beer and tapas just around the corner to wash away any buyer's - or seller's - remorse.
Don't be put off by the word "morning." This is Madrid, not London or New York, so there's no need to turn up with a flashlight at 6 a.m. to get a gander at "the good stuff." The flea market starts around 11 a.m. and is usually packed up and driven away by 3 p.m.
The "official" Rastro is a seemingly endless row of stalls that begins at the Plaza de Cascorro, lines the Calle Ribera de Curtidores and runs downhill to the Ronda de Toledo. You'll find some of the city's cleverest T-shirt designs for considerably less than you'd spend in the tourist shops. But that's not all. Floppy floral brooches and other felt jewelry made in Peru is popular this season, as are hand-tooled leather crafts like book covers and wallets. A few decent watercolor artists sell their sketches and there are whole sections of stalls devoted to vintage flamenco albums, soccer paraphernalia, and ladies' underwear sold six pairs for five euros. Vendors shamelessly drum up interest; one vendor of vintage leather coats last weekend repeatedly intoned (shouted): "liquidation because of divorce."
Shaded beneath a lush canopy of towering poplars, the Rastro has long drawn hordes of Madrileos, who turn up with nearly religious fervor for their Sunday morning stroll and then use it as an excuse to start drinking before lunch. A century ago, the neighborhood was full of slaughterhouses and the name Rastro, meaning trace or trail, refers to the blood stains that once coated the streets. It had a fair number of brothels as well and scenes of its gritty urban lifestyle were a favored subject of early modern Spanish painters like Javier Solana, whose works hang in the Reina Sofa Museum.
While a bit tamer today, the pressing crowds provide ample cover for pickpockets, though there is an increasing vigilant police presence. In any case, leave the backpacks at home.
For anyone who doesn't care for crowds, or doesn't purchase their underwear in open-air markets, there is plenty to enjoy on the neighboring streets, a warren of antiques shops selling vintage everything.
The densest concentration of these is to west of the Rastro's main drag in streets such as Bastero, Mira del Rio Alto, Arganzuela and on the periphery of the Plaza General Vara de Rey. The financial downturn has meant that dealers who once sat inside their shops sipping vermouth and chatting with friends, now make an effort to drag their best wares out to the street and are much more likely to bargain. Don't be afraid to offer half the quoted price as they tend to think all foreigners are rich.
Vendors without storefronts fill the huge Plaza del Campillo del Mundo Nuevo, the center of which is dominated by kids swapping or selling soccer trading cards.
The neighborhood bars also get a good workout on Sunday mornings and it's not uncommon for locals to rendezvous at bars such as El Diamonte on the corner of Calle Toledo and Calle Maldonados for chocolate and churros and then switch over to beers and more savory tapas without ever making it to the shops and stalls.

HEADLINE: Latest Threats May Mean North Korea Wants to Talk

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
For 10 years, South Korea has pursued a ''sunshine policy'' as its master plan for transforming North Korea. Under that banner, South Korea funneled billions of dollars to the North for new factories, hotels and food, and millions of South Korean tourists poured across the border. 
 But eight months after President Lee Myung-bak came to office here promising a harder approach, the once vaunted policy has unraveled. North Korea has cut off high-level dialogue with the South. It has severed Red Cross-managed telephone ''hot lines'' crossing the demilitarized zone. In July, a North Korean soldier shot and killed a South Korean tourist visiting its Diamond Mountain resort, leading to its closing. 
 The North is now threatening to shut down an industrial complex in the North Korean town of Kaesong, the best South Korea had to show for its 10 years of sunshine policy. During an inspection tour earlier this month, a high-ranking North Korean general turned to the South Korean factory owners and asked, ''How soon do you think you can pack your gear and go home?'' 
 Last week, North Korea further confounded the rest of the world. It said it had never agreed to let American experts take samples from its main nuclear complex, contrary to Washington's announcement that it had.
 All in all, the North's actions seemed to point not only to the end of the sunshine policy but also to a dangerous disintegration of relations. But longtime North Korea watchers see it much differently, saying that the moves fit a familiar and consistent pattern, and that they may even signal an upturn in relations with the United States.
 Over the years, they say, North Korea has divided its negotiations with the outside world into what analysts call ''salami pieces,'' maximizing its gains at each stage. If the opponent balks, it uses brinkmanship. 
 ''North Korea got what it could from Bush. Now it is signaling to President-elect Barack Obama, 'O.K., let's negotiate again over nuclear sampling,' '' said Lee Sang-hyun, an analyst at Sejong Institute, a research organization. ''To Lee Myung-bak, its message is that it means action if he doesn't reconsider his policy.''
 To pull off the two tricks together, North Korea is using its old tactic of ''tongmi bongnam'' -- opening the door to the Americans while shutting it to the South Koreans. The idea is to engage the United States while raising tensions with South Korea, with the aim of driving a wedge between allies. 
 North Korea, a master of survival surrounded by bigger powers, has often used this tactic of creating and then exploiting their disputes and may be particularly tempted to use it now that leaders with such different approaches have taken power in Seoul and Washington. Unlike Mr. Lee or President Bush for most of his term, Mr. Obama has emphasized a policy of open and aggressive diplomacy with the world's so-called rogue states. 
 Eight years ago, North Korea used a similar rift to its advantage, only then the roles of Seoul and Washington were reversed. In 2000, the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, embraced South Korea's president, Kim Dae-jung, who traveled to Pyongyang, the North's capital, with his sunshine policy. The incoming Bush administration barely hid its contempt. It lumped North Korea into an ''axis of evil'' and denied it direct dialogue until it first agreed to give up its nuclear weapons program. 
 The friction between Washington and Seoul continued to trouble relations throughout Mr. Bush's first term, as South Koreans saw Washington as a hindrance to a faster reconciliation with the North. Although hobbled by American-led international sanctions, North Korea succeeded in extracting generous aid from South Korea. 
 In 2006, North Korea changed the dynamics of nuclear talks by conducting its first nuclear test. But with Washington growing more eager to strike a nuclear disarmament deal with the North, South Koreans ended a decade of liberal rule by electing President Lee. 
 Mr. Lee is a conservative who wants to make his mark as a disciplinarian on North Korea. He questioned huge investments promised to the North by his two liberal predecessors, Mr. Kim and Roh Moo-hyun. He vowed not to support any major economic help for the North until there was a breakthrough in dismantling its nuclear facilities. While Washington agreed to ship 500,000 tons of food to North Korea, Mr. Lee said that South Korea would not give food aid unless the North publicly asked for it. 
 North Korea never did, and it never forgave. It called Mr. Lee ''despicable human scum,'' an epithet it had previously reserved for John R. Bolton, Washington's hard-line strategist during Mr. Bush's first term. 
 ''Obviously the North Koreans decided that they can sacrifice the sunshine policy and show to everybody in Seoul that they don't care,'' said Andrei Lankov, a North Korea expert at Kookmin University in Seoul. ''Meanwhile, we will see spring in the North Korea-U.S. relations.'' 
 The North Korean tactic puts Mr. Lee, a self-styled pragmatist, in a difficult position. Abandoning his principled stance will be seen as surrender by his supporters, while staying the course will virtually assure that North Korea shuts down Kaesong, analysts say. That will feed South Korean fears of an unstable peninsula and provide Mr. Lee's liberal critics with plentiful ammunition. 
 Perhaps the greatest current concern about North Korea's recent moves, Korea experts say, is what they may signal about the internal dynamics of the regime. ''The more intriguing issue is whether all these developments signal a growing role of the military,'' said Daniel C. Sneider, associate director for research at Stanford University's Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center. ''And the tour of Kaesong by the military was troubling in that regard.'' 
 The military is said to detest Kaesong and its capitalistic influence, as well as any deal that would deprive it of nuclear weapons. 
 Kim Jong-il has been known to let his military speak up when he wants to raise tensions ahead of talks with the Americans. Analysts say it may also signal that North Korea's priority is shifting from the economic benefits (33,000 North Korean workers in Kaesong earn $60 a month) to internal security amid reports that Mr. Kim suffered a stroke in August. 
 ''It is the conservative mood that prevails in Pyongyang now,'' said Leonid A. Petrov, a North Korea expert at Australian National University and a frequent visitor to the North Korean capital. 
 With all the speculation over the North's motives, Mr. Lankov, of Kookmin University, said, one thing seemed clear. 
 ''The decision to close Kaesong is a very big decision that no one in North Korea can make without explicit approval from Kim Jong-il,'' he said. ''It is an indirect confirmation that he is in control.''

HEADLINE: What Happy People Don't Do

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
Happy people spend a lot of time socializing, going to church and reading newspapers -- but they don't spend a lot of time watching television, a new study finds. 
 That's what unhappy people do.
 Although people who describe themselves as happy enjoy watching television, it turns out to be the single activity they engage in less often than unhappy people, said John Robinson, a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland and the author of the study, which appeared in the journal Social Indicators Research.
 While most large studies on happiness have focused on the demographic characteristics of happy people -- factors like age and martial status -- Dr. Robinson and his colleagues tried to identify what activities happy people engage in. The study relied primarily on the responses of 45,000 Americans collected over 35 years by the University of Chicago's General Social Survey, and on published ''time diary'' studies recording the daily activities of participants.
 ''We looked at 8 to 10 activities that happy people engage in, and for each one, the people who did the activities more -- visiting others, going to church, all those things -- were more happy,'' Dr. Robinson said. ''TV was the one activity that showed a negative relationship. Unhappy people did it more, and happy people did it less.'' 
 But the researchers could not tell whether unhappy people watch more television or whether being glued to the set is what makes people unhappy. ''I don't know that turning off the TV will make you more happy,'' Dr. Robinson said.
 Still, he said, the data show that people who spend the most time watching television are least happy in the long run.
 Since the major predictor of how much time is spent watching television is whether someone works or not, Dr. Robinson added, it's possible that rising unemployment will lead to more TV time.

HEADLINE: Turnaround Specialist Talks of City Opera Plans

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
Even before the full board of New York City Opera learned that its proposed savior, Gerard Mortier, was saying goodbye, its chairwoman had turned to a man known in the arts as a turnaround specialist: Michael M. Kaiser, the president of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.
 The move by the chairwoman, Susan L. Baker, reflected the sense of crisis at the opera, which just a year and a half ago had plunged into a radical transformation based on Mr. Mortier's vision, including a large-scale renovation of its theater.
 Mr. Kaiser said his role was ''really simple.'' 
 ''I've been asked by Susan and the board of the opera to help them write a plan for going forward,'' he said. ''It's very specific.'' He said he was not being paid and was not a candidate for the job. ''If they asked me, I'd say no.'' 
 Mr. Mortier's departure as general director-designate was confirmed after a meeting of the board's executive committee on Nov. 4, a Tuesday, Ms. Baker said. Mr. Kaiser said he received a call from her on Wednesday or Thursday. Mr. Mortier's departure became public that Friday, when the full board was told.
 When asked what he would recommend for City Opera, Mr. Kaiser said it would be to create a budget ''they can afford to live with.'' Mr. Mortier agreed to come with the understanding that the budget would be $60 million, up from a deficit-ridden $42 million. When the board proposed only about $36 million because of the economic downturn, Mr. Mortier said he could not work there.
 Mr. Kaiser next said it was important for the company ''to attract an artistic leader who's going to be able to play on their strength and create interesting and important programming.'' Ms. Baker said she hoped to have a successor to Mr. Mortier in place by the end of the year.
 Mr. Kaiser recently published ''The Art of the Turnaround'' (Brandeis University Press), a chronicle of his efforts to help once-troubled organizations like Alvin Ailey Dance Theater, American Ballet Theater and the Royal Opera House in London.
 When asked to judge what went wrong at City Opera, he blamed a ''confluence of events,'' including the economy. But he also faulted the board for not doing enough financial analysis. No. 9 of his book's rules for a turnaround is, ''The board must allow itself to be restructured.''
 ''I think that there wasn't a realistic discussion about whether this $60 million budget was affordable,'' he said. ''There was a great deal of optimism that Mr. Mortier's programming would be so enticing that they would be able to build their fund-raising very fast.'' 
 Mr. Mortier, who turns 65 on Tuesday and is known for his provocative contemporary approach to opera, put together a slate of challenging 20th-century works for next season, omitting operas like ''Carmen'' and ''La Boheme'' that appeal to the more traditional-minded wealthy donors. He also wanted to take performances to other places around New York and establish a ''stagione'' season, in which productions play in sequence, one after another, instead of in repertory. Others in the opera world have questioned the performance of City Opera's board in establishing what in hindsight seems like a mismatch. 
 The Belgian-born Mr. Mortier, who is in his final year running the Paris National Opera and who made his career in Europe, was used to large government subsidies and had little experience at opera houses where private money has to be cultivated. Doubts intensified when Mr. Mortier made a bid in August to become co-director of the Bayreuth Festival in Germany and rumors circulated in the opera world that he was looking elsewhere. This week a spokeswoman for the Teatro Real in Madrid said Mr. Mortier was a possible candidate for its artistic director.
 ''My personal feeling was he wasn't going to end up coming anyway,'' said Kevin Smith, president of the Minnesota Opera, who has collaborated with City Opera. ''I didn't see the match making sense.'' He said the transformation sought by Mr. Mortier was a stretch, and that the board bore some responsibility for the tough spot in which City Opera finds itself.
 ''There's a lot of reflection that needs to happen from a governance point of view,'' he said of the board. ''It certainly raises a lot of questions in terms of how the board was functioning.''
 Jurgen Flimm, a successor to Mr. Mortier as artistic director of the Salzburg Festival in Austria, said City Opera was ''exactly the wrong theater for him.''
 ''The mistake is that Gerard wanted to blow it up into a major company,'' Mr. Flimm added, ''but there is not money to do that.''
 Ms. Baker, in a telephone interview Wednesday, strongly defended the choice of Mr. Mortier -- which she championed but which she also said was unanimous within the search committee -- and the promise of a bigger budget for the company.
 ''I continue to think that the board made a very intelligent choice in settling on Mortier in the last search, believing his work would galvanize fund-raising and ticket sales,'' she said. ''His work is must-see in today's marketplace. It was an intelligent way to go. In those markets, it made good sense.''
 Ms. Baker, who has been chairwoman since 2004, said that despite Mr. Kaiser's precept on board renewal, the current turmoil argued against bringing in new board members. As for her future, she said, ''I'm working very hard right now with the rest of the board to create a terrific next chapter for City Opera.'' In the future, ''if it makes sense for somebody else to take a leadership position, I'm certainly ready for that to happen,'' she said.
 One board member, Emilie Roy Corey, who was on the search committee that approved Mr. Mortier's appointment in early 2007, said the panel was going back to other candidates considered along with Mr. Mortier. 
 ''We're trying the best we can to get the situation back on track,'' she said, but she acknowledged that the unthinkable -- City Opera's demise -- was looming in the background. ''I guess it's crossed a lot of our minds.'' 
 The company's difficulties also lay with the effective cancellation of this season, cutting most of the ticket revenue, while renovations pushed by Mr. Mortier go forward at the New York State Theater, the company's home.
 The major private donor for the work is David H. Koch, a businessman who promised $100 million and will have the theater renamed for him. A spokesman said he was unavailable to comment. 
 When the gift was announced in July, Mr. Koch said, ''I can assure you, I would not make a gift of this magnitude unless I was absolutely convinced that the quality of the work was world class.''

HEADLINE: Merrily They Dress

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
CHINS up, people. Hem lengths, too.
 Here we are at the outset of what is shaping up to be a six-week season of grinchiness. Holiday festivities, we are told, are being downsized and will amount to little more than a plate of cold cuts with a lump of coal as the centerpiece. This year B.Y.O.B. means bring your own bonus.
 So we can choose to dress in a manner appropriately morose for the times and prove the timeworn adage that hems fall with the stock market. Or we can throw caution to the wind, as John Galliano did on Monday night, when he arrived at a party wearing the traditional button-covered costume of a Pearly King (the neighborhood monarch who protected the local street vendors of Victorian London). The mother-of-pearl buttons on his suit formed a pattern of vines, and his top hat was trimmed with rings of fresh daisies. The room was hotter than an orchid house. 
 ''I hope I don't wilt,'' Mr. Galliano said.
 The party was given by the Council of Fashion Designers of America and Vogue to alleviate the pain of cash-starved young designers with financial prizes and mentoring. The CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund was created five years ago, something like a Troubled Asset Relief Program for regular folk like Proenza Schouler and Phillip Lim. But seeing as Conde Nast, like many companies, has canceled its customary Christmas events this year, the occasion also served as a de facto holiday party. 
 The dress code on the invitation said ''Dress Up,'' but practically no one took that as a reason to wear black. Rather they seemed to take it as a challenge to dress in a spirit that could be described as Up With Fashion. Despite the presence of a few crabby-looking retailers who were not feeling very U.W.F., the party swarmed with famous models wearing the shortest of skirts and socialites clinging to their decadent dresses. All in all, the crowd reflected the upbeat and offhand style that seems to define the look of the season.
 At the very least, they showed that hem lengths have not fallen just yet. 
 ''I actually feel very bright and optimistic,'' said Dr. Lisa Airan, the Manhattan dermatologist, who was wearing a snow-white silk Lanvin dress with feathered frippery around the bodice, white leather biker gloves from Rodarte and hot pink pumps by Giambattista Valli.
 Mr. Valli happened to be standing nearby, wearing a pearl necklace. Which is to say that the mood was far from funereal.
 ''Now that we have a new president and we're moving forward,'' Dr. Airan said, ''I think that maybe we've gone through the worst of it.''
 As Alexander Wang, the designer who won the CFDA/Vogue prize this year, said in Harper's Bazaar, the old rules of dressing appropriately for holiday parties no longer apply. No daytime rules or nighttime formality. Shorts can work if they have style. 
 That may sound like a flippant approach to the subject of party dressing, given the serious troubles facing the nation and the economy at this moment, reflected in the devastating sales numbers coming from retailers since September. But dressing up can still have an emotionally uplifting effect, even if most people are doing their shopping in their own closets.
 Erin Fetherston, another designer, had considered wearing black to the party, but changed her mind and wore a floral print dress that was bold enough to have come from Murano. ''I'm feeling more polished all of a sudden,'' she said. 
 Last year, as gas prices skyrocketed and home values declined, it was actually short and skin-tight dresses that were selling. As the economy worsened, fashion moved in still stranger and less expected directions, toward bondage references, for example, but also harem pants, jumpsuits, prep school and polish, all at the same time. The result, coming out at night this holiday season, is evening wear that looks like a mash-up of ''Mad Men'' and ''Gossip Girl.''
 ''Everyone's so glum right now that it's really time to bring out the glad rags,'' said the designer Sue Stemp. ''I love a great-fitting cocktail dress to lift the mood, and now is the perfect time.''
 Perhaps that is wishful thinking. Robert Burke, a former fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman who is now a luxury consultant, reported that women are buying ''nothing too loud, nothing that screams fashion.'' Elie Tahari said that taffeta gowns and extravagant looks are going to be less popular than something that can be worn beyond the season, like skirts and jackets that can be layered and gussied up with a piece of jewelry.
 ''Women want to dress up and make themselves feel good,'' he said, ''but they don't want to spend a lot of money.''
 At the same time, it has not gone unnoticed that the Obama family is setting a U.W.F. example for America that is lifting designers' spirits. Ever since the Obamas appeared on election night as a coordinated fashion tableau, as if they had just stepped out of a holiday greeting card portrait, sales of red dresses have been terrific, said Kay Unger, who makes party frocks.
 Customers are being more inventive, she added, by buying short-sleeve jackets that can be worn over a dress or with long gloves, then wearing the same jacket with jeans for an office look.
 ''The people who are not affected by this economy are the young people who didn't have an I.R.A. or money invested in the stock market, so they are seeing things in a different way,'' Ms. Unger said. ''They're buying things just for going out. And they are mostly buying short dresses, in 99 percent of the cases, because they are really fun and they can go a lot of places.'' 
 Also, you can still see their cute shoes.
 For those women who are shopping with value and versatility in mind, the Little Black Dress remains a popular choice, but, Ms. Unger said, there is just as much interest in flashier metallic fabrics like bronze or brushed gold, which have a more limited shelf life. Similarly, Nicole Miller cited gold and silver fabrics as the look of the season, ''because it makes everyone look 10 pounds thinner,'' she said. 
 Seriously? ''The texture makes things look camouflaged, unlike a really flat fabric,'' she said. 
 And if you're on a budget, you can always improvise with gift wrap.

HEADLINE: Economy Faces 'Significant Weakness,' Fed Says

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve on Wednesday sharply lowered its projection for economic activity this year and next, and signaled that additional interest rate reductions may be needed to help combat the worst financial crisis in more than a half-century. 
 With the economy forecast to lose traction, or even jolt into reverse, unemployment will move higher, the Fed predicted.
 Facing the likelihood of ''significant weakness'' in the economy, some Fed officials suggested ''additional policy easing could well be appropriate at future meetings,'' according to documents from the Fed's most recent deliberations on interest rate policy at the end of October.
 At that Oct. 29 session, the Fed lowered rates to 1 percent, a level seen only once before in the last half-century. Many economists predict the Fed will lower rates again at its last meeting of the year on Dec. 16, to help brace the sinking economy.
 Even while hinting that another rate reduction could be forthcoming, Fed officials worried that the effectiveness of previous rate cuts ''may have been diminished by the financial dislocations, suggesting that further policy action might have limited efficacy in promoting a recovery in economic growth,'' the documents said.
 To help ease financial turmoil and spur banks to lend money more freely again to customers, the Fed has taken a series of other unprecedented steps, including offering short-term cash loans and buying mounds of short-term debt that companies rely on to pay day-to-day expenses like payrolls and supplies.
 Under its new economic forecast, the Fed now believes gross domestic product could be flat or grow by 0.3 percent this year. G.D.P. could actually shrink or expand by 1.1 percent next year. Both sets of projections are lower than the Fed's forecasts delivered to Congress in July.
 G.D.P. is the value of all goods and services produced within the United States and is the best measure of the country's economic health.
 These forecasts are based on what the Fed calls its ''central tendencies,'' which exclude the highest three forecasts and the lowest three forecasts made by Fed officials. The Fed also gives a range of all forecasts that showed some Fed officials projecting a 0.3 percent dip this year, followed by a deeper 1 percent contraction next year.
 The prospects for weaker economic activity will push up unemployment. The Fed projected that the national unemployment rate will rise to 6.3 percent to 6.5 percent this year. The rate in October was 6.5 percent, and last year the rate averaged 4.6 percent.
 Next year, the Fed expects the jobless rate to climb to be 7.1 percent to 7.6 percent -- also higher than its summer forecast.
 Inflation, meanwhile, is expected to be lower this year and next compared with the Fed's previous forecast. A global economic slowdown is sapping demand for energy, food and other commodities, driving down prices and reducing inflation risks.

HEADLINE: What's the Point of Daylight Time?

BYLINE: By MATTHEW J. KOTCHEN and LAURA E. GRANT.

 BODY:
 WHY do we -- along with 75 other countries -- alternate between standard time and daylight time? Although many people believe it has an agricultural provenance, daylight time has always been a policy meant to save energy. As Benjamin Franklin argued, if people moved up their summer schedules by an hour, they could live by ''sunshine rather than candles'' in the evenings. 
 Energy conservation was the motivation for daylight time during World Wars I and II and the oil embargo of the 1970s, and it remains so today -- even though there has been little scientific evidence to suggest daylight time actually helps us cut back on electricity use.
 Recently, however, we were able to conduct a study in Indiana, where daylight time was instituted statewide only in 2006. Before that year, daylight time was in effect in just a handful of counties. This change of policy offered a unique, natural experiment to measure the overall effect on residential electricity consumption. We could compare the amount of energy used by households in the late-adopting counties during the two years before they switched to daylight time with the amounts they used during the year afterward -- while using counties that always practiced daylight time as a control group.
 We found that daylight time caused a 1 percent overall increase in residential electricity use, though the effect varied from month to month. The greatest increase occurred in late summer and early fall, when electricity use rose by 2 percent to 4 percent. 
 Daylight time costs Indiana households an average of $3.29 a year in higher electricity bills, or about $9 million for the whole state. We also calculated the health and other social costs of increased pollution emissions at $1.7 million to $5.5 million per year.
 What explains this unexpected result? While daylight time reduces demand for household lighting, it increases demand for heating in the early spring and late fall (in the mornings) and, even more important, for cooling on summer evenings. Benjamin Franklin was right about candles, in other words, but he did not consider air-conditioners.
 In regions of the United States where demand for air-conditioning is greater than in Indiana, this spike in cooling costs is likely to be even greater. Arizona, one of the hottest states, may have it right; it does not practice daylight time. 
 Eliminating daylight time would thus accord with President-elect Barack Obama's stated goals of conserving resources, saving money, promoting energy security and reducing climate change. At the very least, we should abandon the notion that we are saving energy while enjoying the extra hour of sunlight on hot summer evenings.

HEADLINE: U.S. Urges Merchant Ships To Try Steps to Foil Pirates

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER; Hari Kumar contributed reporting from New Delhi, and Alan Cowell from Paris.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The commander of American and allied naval forces off the coast of Somalia has begun efforts to halt a spike in piracy, urging merchant vessels to sail with armed guards on board and to travel only within lanes now patrolled by warships.
 The commander, Vice Adm. William E. Gortney of the United States Navy, said crews of merchant ships were being taught measures that did not involve the use of force to prevent pirates from boarding their vessels. 
 The techniques include complicated rudder movements and speed adjustments that make it hard for pirate speedboats to pull alongside, as well as simple steps like pulling up ladders that some ships leave dangling for an entire voyage.
 Pentagon officials said the growing problem of piracy presented yet another vexing national security threat that could not be solved by force alone, even though increased patrols had reduced the success rate of pirate raids. 
 Admiral Gortney, commander of the United States Fifth Fleet, with headquarters in Bahrain, said the goal of the more than a dozen warships from different countries now patrolling off Somalia was to prevent piracy. He stressed that there were no plans to mount rescues of the 18 ships and their crews currently being held by pirates.
 ''The cargo on board does not warrant the risk to the hostages at this particular point,'' Admiral Gortney said in an interview here.
 The one possible exception is a Ukrainian freighter held by pirates, with cargo including T-72 tanks, rocket-propelled grenades and antiaircraft guns. Any attempt to unload that cargo into Somalia may prompt military action, Pentagon officials said.
 As negotiations began for the release of a Saudi-owned supertanker seized by pirates off Somalia, the Indian Navy said Wednesday that one of its warships had fought with would-be hijackers in the Gulf of Aden, sinking one vessel and forcing the pirates to abandon a second.
 The rise in pirate attacks in a strategic waterway that carries a third of the world's fuel supplies has captured global attention. But United States officials say the problem can be resolved only when Somalia is able to curb pirates operating from its shores and the shipping giants take more steps to secure the passage of their cargo.
 ''The ultimate solution is on the beach -- Somalia -- assuring security and stability and making sure the conditions that breed pirates are no longer there,'' Admiral Gortney said. ''Lacking that, the only thing we can do is prevent piracy. And we are doing that as more nations of the world send additional warships to help patrol the waters out there.''
 Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon press secretary, released statistics on Wednesday showing that so far in 2008, there had been 95 reports of piracy attacks in the Gulf of Aden and surrounding waters, with 39 of those resulting in the capture of vessels. An estimated 330 sailors from 25 nations remain hostages, with no known American citizens among them.
 There have been no reports of attacks on United States-flagged vessels, and officials have interpreted that record as a sign that the pirates do not want to provoke the American Navy directly.
 Mr. Morrell said the piracy problem ''requires a holistic approach from the international community at sea, ashore, with governance, with economic development.''
 Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said this week that there were legal and military obstacles to combating piracy. ''One of the challenges that you have in piracy, clearly, is, if you are intervening and you capture pirates, is there a path to prosecute them?'' he said. 
 Although some analysts have warned of a link between pirates and terrorists in the region who say they are aligned with Al Qaeda, Admiral Mullen said, ''I have not seen any connection to Al Qaeda or to terrorists per se.''
 The hijacking of the Saudi-owned supertanker, Sirius Star, was followed by a report on Wednesday, still to be confirmed by Greek authorities, that a Greek bulk carrier had been seized in the Gulf of Aden.

HEADLINE: Emerging Powers Seen Taking Lead

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
BARCELONA, Spain -- The United States may have plunged the world into a sharp economic downturn, but it will take the combined efforts of China and other emerging nations to lead the global economy out of what is likely to be a long and painful recession.
That was the view of several business executives, government officials and economic experts gathered Monday and Tuesday for a conference on China's role in the global economy. 
''China alone may be only 6 percent of the world economy,'' said Josep Pique, chairman of Vueling, a budget airline based in Barcelona. ''But together with India, Brazil and other big emerging nations, they represent about 30 percent of global G.D.P. The emerging countries are the solution to the overall global slump.''
That point of view was echoed by Claude Begle, chairman of Swiss Post, which runs Switzerland's public savings bank, who predicted that Asian emerging nations would be the first to recover from the slump, followed by the United States and then Europe.
But not everybody was so confident in the ability of China and Asia's other fast-growing countries to spur a global recovery.
''China cannot replace the U.S. economy as the engine of global growth,'' said Chang Dae Whan, chairman of Maeil, a South Korean newspaper company. ''We're going to need a huge stimulus package from the United States, on the order of $2 trillion, to get the global economy out of the financial crisis. So far, we've only seen about $700 billion. As a result, next year I expect to see more pain and fear.''
The Global China Business Meeting here, sponsored by Horasis, a consulting organization based in Geneva, and supported by several business and government organizations in Spain, China and elsewhere, is the fourth annual gathering of the group, whose goal is to encourage more trade and business contact between China and Europe.
The Chinese economy, for all its success since emerging from economic isolation in the 1980s, is at a major turning point, participants here suggested, that will require a fundamental adjustment in its approach to development.
Timothy Beardson, chairman of Albert Place Holdings in Hong Kong and a leading adviser to companies doing business in China, said that China had lost a number of advantages that powered its phenomenal double-digit growth rates of recent years.
''For the last 10 years, China had it good,'' Mr. Beardson said. ''For the next 10 years, it won't have it so good at all.''
He pointed to several factors that are going to make it far more difficult for China to rely on booming exports to power its growth and to improve the nation's standard of living at a rapid pace.
He said that China spends far less on research and development, as a share of its economy, than Japan, the United States and most other advanced economies, making it difficult to upgrade China's industrial structure.
He also said that China has a weak system of higher education, and lacks any substantial social safety net, which makes its citizens fearful about their future and encourages them to save to excess rather than spend.
The most immediate challenge, he said, was that China's currency, while rising only modestly against the dollar, has strengthened significantly against the currencies of its Asian competitors and against most European currencies, making its exports far less competitive in global markets.
''If Chinese companies are to succeed in the future,'' he said, they will have to recognize that ''their comparative advantage lies in the domestic market, not the export economy.''
Chinese officials here, while acknowledging many difficulties, made clear that they were convinced that the nation would weather the first real test of its economic resilience since Beijing adopted a market approach to economic development. But they said that China would need to work more closely with other economies, including the United States and Europe, to overcome the current financial crisis.
''Confidence and cooperation,'' said Xu Kuangdi, chairman of the China Federation of Industrial Economics, ''are worth more than money and gold.''

HEADLINE: Change We Can Believe In

BYLINE: By TORI TELLEM

 BODY:
Introduced on Wednesday:Honda Insight Concept
 Is it real? Fresh from getting its passport stamped for the Paris Motor Show, the Insight is having its North American debut in Los Angeles. Take a deep whiff of that new-hybrid smell. 
 What they said: ''While the Insight Concept's aerodynamic design clearly identifies its fuel-efficient purpose, its five-door access and folding rear seats speak to functionality that is designed to meet the needs of customers with an active lifestyle,'' explained the press materials.
 What they didn't say: ''Honda already had a hybrid available in the United States. It was a two-seater, also called Insight. Thanks for noticing.''
 What makes it tick: It uses Honda's existing Integrated Motor Assist hybrid powertrain, but in a smaller package and with lighter components. The system combines an electric motor with a 1.3-liter VTEC engine.
 How much, how soon? The upgrades to IMA are said to allow Honda to price the new-generation Insight ''significantly below hybrids available today'' when it arrives next spring. We'll go out on a limb and assume it'll be ''significantly below'' the six-figure Lexus LS 600h L, putting it comparable to the Toyota Prius.
 How's it look? A hybrid that doesn't resemble a Dick Tracy villain, is priced affordably, seats five and gets great fuel economy? It's what the public seems to want -- especially given Toyota already did the heavy lifting.

HEADLINE: A Costly City Tries Pricing Its Parking By Popularity

BYLINE: By JESSE McKINLEY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
In a city known for its pricey property, and terrible parking, some of the most valuable real estate may soon be curbside. 
 Under a trial plan passed Tuesday by the board of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, 6,000 of the city's precious parking spots will be priced on a sliding scale depending on how popular they are. And while the worst locales will go cheaply -- as little as a quarter -- a handful of premium parking spots will be worth $18 an hour, or nearly a pound of quarters. 
 Other cities have dabbled in such pricing, but Nathaniel P. Ford Sr., executive director of the transportation agency, said San Francisco's plan -- due to start in the spring with the aid of new meters, sensors and $18.4 million in federal financing -- would place the city at the forefront of parking technology. Mr. Ford cited the various benefits it would reap, including reducing congestion and carbon emissions from circling cars and ensuring pedestrians are not sideswiped by parking-obsessed drivers.
 ''It's an exciting time,'' said Mr. Ford, who also pointed to advances in payment technology, including the ability to buy parking time with a cellphone. 
 Under the 18-month pilot plan, meters in six of the city's most trafficked neighborhoods will be remotely monitored for ''occupancy,'' transit officials said. Mr. Ford will then have the prerogative of lowering or raising rates on four-to-six-week cycles as supply and demand requires. While most meters would be capped at $6 an hour, rates during big events like concerts or a game could enter the $18 range. 
 Not everyone shared Mr. Ford's enthusiasm for the plan. ''That's outrageous,'' said Louis Issac, a San Francisco resident who works for a towing company and was feeding a meter at City Hall on Wednesday. ''With things right now, the economy, people losing jobs? It's a lack of consideration.''
 Donald Shoup, a parking expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, said San Francisco's plan would provide incentive for using mass transit and discourage those searching for the perfect -- and cheap -- spot. 
 ''I think when we look back on this period 20 to 30 years from now,'' said Mr. Shoup, who consulted on the plan, ''We'll say, 'My God, what were these people thinking having free parking?' ''

HEADLINE: Failing Home Economics

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
IT was nearly six months ago that Jill Andresky Fraser, a financial journalist, was undone by a cauliflower. Like almost every other household in America, Ms. Fraser's was starting to embrace a new austerity, and the cauliflower was an early milestone. 
 Until this year, Ms. Fraser, whose math skills are formidable (she has written books on personal and corporate finance), had always practiced a shopping calculus that balanced time against money. ''If there was a choice between the two, I would choose anything that would save me time,'' Ms. Fraser said. But no longer. And so it was that she found herself shopping for groceries on the Upper West Side, stymied by the price of a cauliflower ($5) in the first store she visited. A market a block or so away sold cauliflowers for $2.99 each, but a can of artichoke hearts (another item on her list) was $4.99. A third store offered a deal -- three heads of cauliflower for $5 -- which was a good thing, because it was getting late and the day was disintegrating into the narrative of a fourth-grader's word problem. Ms. Fraser filled a cart with cauliflower and other groceries. When the cashier rung her up, however, it turned out that the artichoke hearts at this store were $6.99 a can, and Ms. Fraser had bought four. 
 ''So on the one hand I had saved all this money on cauliflower,'' Ms. Fraser said, ''but probably my family was never going to eat that much cauliflower, and there was the problem of the $7 artichokes. In the end, I had spent more money than I had ever planned. This was a cosmic moment.'' 
 All around the country, at similar cosmic moments, perfectly sound brains have been seizing up like an old car on a frigid day, particularly in the last few weeks. As Americans attempt to perform cost-benefit analyses of their needs and behaviors, they are whittling pennies from cable bills only to squander dollars on gas driving miles to discount stores, or on coupon-spurred splurges for nonessential items, like Cheez Whiz or organizing supplies. Pinched by shriveled retirement and college accounts, battered by ballooning mortgage costs, rent and co-op maintenance increases, and hedging against the possibility that a job might vanish, some are practicing economies that may not deserve the name. 
 When Best Buy announced its latest sales figures last month, the company reported ''an unprecedented drop in consumer buying of items like flat-screen televisions,'' said Ori Brafman, a business expert and an author, with his brother, Rom, of ''Sway: The Irresistible Pull of Irrational Behavior,'' out since June from Doubleday Business. ''But when Wal-Mart released its report last week, there was a surprise. Consumers had increased their flat-screen purchases. Somehow, because Wal-Mart feels like a bargain store, shoppers who have deprived themselves of luxury items elsewhere rationalized their purchases at Wal-Mart as 'getting a good deal,' '' Mr. Brafman continued. ''Granted, flat-panel TV's at Wal-Mart might run a little cheaper than elsewhere, but no financial adviser would include one on his or her list of Items to Buy During Tough Times.''
 Americans may be forgoing Starbucks and stocking up on Spam, but they are also making severe ''diagnostic errors,'' Mr. Brafman said. ''They're stressed out, and using the wrong information'' -- such as the belief that buying at Wal-Mart equals saving money -- ''to make a decision, and ignoring all other data that contradicts that decision.'' 
 Kathy Peel, a Dallas-based family manager (that is, a life coach whose niche is training families to run their homes like businesses), said that incidences of feckless budgeting and bad math seem to be on the rise, at least judging from the reports of coaches trained in her system. Leslie McKee, a Peel-trained family manager in Pittsburgh, has noticed a pattern of ''people signing up for discount stores that sell in bulk and over-purchasing 'bargains' that are so enormous they will not live long enough to use the item,'' she said. ''Then they call me and spend more money to help them organize it all into mini-malls inside their homes.'' 
 At the high end, there are bulk buyers like Rick Angres, a screenwriter in Santa Monica, Calif., who visits two farmers' markets each week, stocking up on lilies and orchids. ''On the one hand I get a very good price,'' he said. ''On the other hand, I spend perhaps 10 times as much on flowers as is appropriate for a man of my means.''
 Representing the opposite extreme, Ms. McKee said, is the client who is rewinding adding-machine tape so she can use the other side, or the woman whose laundry room is cluttered with dozens of empty laundry detergent bottles, awaiting their turn in the washer, where she leaves one each night -- cap off and upside down -- to drain out the last drop of liquid. 
 ''What's happening I think is we are letting all our gremlins out,'' said Carol Prisant, American editor of The World of Interiors magazine. ''Some people will obsess about drops of detergent and others will want to buy in massive quantities. This is the moment when we all sort of mildly crack up.''
 Ms. Prisant, an antiques expert who has written books on how to gauge the value of furniture and other decorative objects, nonetheless stumbled recently, with a budgeting choice that involved shunning the $12 quart of green tomato soup at Grace's Market -- once a weekly purchase -- but forking out $500 for two extra-large doughnut-shaped and oyster-colored dog beds from Perfect Dog Beds, which match the color of her new apartment. 
 ''O.K., the old ones were yucky,'' Ms. Prisant said. ''But they were also, um, brown.''
 ''Grocery wise, cable foolish'' is how Richard Winkler, an executive producer at Curious Pictures, a television production company in Manhattan, describes his current habits. ''You know, walking three blocks to save 10 cents on Triscuits,'' Mr. Winkler said, while ''my phone bill still has charges like $4.99 per month for technical stunts I can't even pronounce, much less access. No wonder Verizon is doing well.'' (Mr. Winkler, whose wife has been entering their expenses into a Quicken financial planning program, vows to look at the budget she's created -- soon, really -- and start pruning the premium channels from his cable bill.)
 And then there are those who are attempting to save money by spending it. Last month, Terence Lance Buckley, a Manhattan public relations executive, spent $400 at Overstock.com on an electric fireplace, hoping to keep his thermostat off this winter. Mr. Buckley had just moved, and the rent on his new apartment includes electricity but not gas. He now has a beautiful fake fireplace and mantel, but the thing gives off barely enough heat to warm his hands. ''Now I'm cranking up the thermostat to stay warm,'' he said, ''leading me to believe that my brilliant budget plan to save money on heating costs was a waste of $400, money that I could have put towards holiday gifts.''
 AS nonsensical as these maneuvers may appear, behavioral economists and financial consultants like Mr. Brafman say there are reasons for them, variables beyond a bank balance that give rise to gyrations in spending and saving. Psychologically, Mr. Brafman said, sometimes we just can't do the math. 
 A behavior called loss aversion tends to freeze consumers in place in one area even as spending in other areas remains unchecked. Mr. Brafman noted that many would-be travelers, rattled by the rise at the pump last summer, canceled their vacation plans while continuing to spend at home. Gas prices were up, on average, $2 a gallon, he said. ''It seems like a substantial amount, but for a 600 mile trip, that amounts to $80 in savings. This could have been easily recouped by cutting out one trip to a restaurant.'' 
 Loss aversion is a naturally selected trait, said his brother, Rom, a psychologist, ''left over from when cavemen were trying to keep the deer they had just killed away from the bear.'' 
 Dan Ariely, a professor of behavioral economics at M.I.T. and the author of ''Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions'' (HarperCollins, 2008), suggests that our irrational financial behaviors are irrational in very predictable ways. 
 ''In my book I tell the story of the $15 pen,'' he said. ''What if you were told the same pen cost $8 less at a store seven blocks away? You'd walk to the store, right? But if you're buying a suit for $1,115, and the salesman says, Guess what, you can get the same suit for $8 less at a store seven blocks away, you're not likely to take that walk.'' 
 ''Need'' and ''cost,'' he pointed out, are deeply personal and wildly relative. ''I have a student at M.I.T.,'' Mr. Ariely continued, ''a very smart guy, who just wrote me bemoaning the fact he'd lost all this money in the stock market.''
 The student told Mr. Ariely he had wanted to buy a $4,000 mountain bike, and regretted not doing so before the stock slide. However, he had decided to buy the thing anyway. 
 ''He had lost so much money already he was immunized against feeling the pinch of the purchase of the mountain bike,'' Mr. Ariely said. ''In other words, having lost $40,000 in one week, looking at spending $4,000 on a bike seemed like nothing. We see money in relative, rather than absolute, terms.'' 
 What is rational behavior, anyway? In economic terms, Mr. Ariely said, ''rational would mean that you take all possible information into account and you make the optimal decision. But I have a more relaxed definition, which is that rational decisions are those you make and don't regret later.'' Seen in this way, the pleasure of the $4 coffee you still drink may be rational. That is, ''unless I interview you three years from now,'' Mr. Ariely added, ''and you tell me you regret not saving that money for beer.''
 In the meantime, Ms. Prisant is happy with her dog beds, which arrived the other day, and said she has no regrets. ''Fortunately my math is terrible,'' she said, so she didn't know if she was in the red or the black this week. Mr. Buckley is still ruing the purchase of his fireplace. And Ms. McKee, the family manager, is trying to teach her clients restraint. ''Store it at the store,'' is how she put it. ''Buy it when you need it. Portion control studies have shown that when we buy more, we use more.''
 And Ms. Fraser, the cauliflower buyer, has refashioned her ''cosmic moment'' as a business opportunity. Her new blog, EconoWhiner.com, is fueled by two principles. One is pure service, ''actionable advice from Real World Joes,'' as she put it, like price comparisons on all sorts of items (as of this week, canned tomatoes, tuna and olive oil, but no cauliflower), tips for surviving a firing and how to slash funeral costs. The other mandate is catharsis. Goaded by the remark by former Senator Phil Gramm that America is a ''nation of whiners,'' Ms. Fraser would like to invite readers to her site to vent and complain. ''A lot of people tend to blame themselves,'' she said. ''But we can only go so far blaming ourselves. This situation is beyond our control, we're saddled with a mess we didn't create. Complaining is a very effective defense.'' 
 If you can't budget, whine.

HEADLINE: Frozen Dinners Recalled, Rising Blood Donations and Bullied Children

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
 Record Blood Donations
 More people in need of cash are selling their blood plasma to earn an extra $20 to $45, The Chicago Tribune reports. Donations may hit 16 million this year, up from 10 million three years earlier, according to an industry group. Pharmaceutical companies use plasma to make drugs for hemophilia and other conditions. 
 Baltimore Ponders a Ban on Sidewalk Smoking
 The Baltimore City Council is considering a bill that would create smoke-free zones on sidewalks next to the city's 17 hospitals, The Baltimore Sun reports. Sidewalk smokers would be subject to a $50 fine if the bill passes.
 Emotional Consequences for Bullied Children
 Though not all children who are bullied by their peers suffer long-lasting effects, some may develop emotional scars that last a lifetime, USA Today reports. Jodee Blanco, author of the book ''Please Stop Laughing At Us,'' says her only crime as a child was being different.
 Tainted Meat
 A potentially deadly intestinal bacterium called Clostridium difficile, which usually infects hospital patients, has been showing up in supermarket meats, msnbc.com reports, raising the possibility that domestic animals may be a source of infections.
 Frozen Dinners Recalled
 Nestle is recalling three types of frozen Lean Cuisine entrees after small bits of plastic were discovered in the foods; the recalled entrees are the pesto chicken with bow tie pasta, the chicken Mediterranean and chicken Tuscan, The Los Angeles Times reports.
 Nov. 18, 2008
 New Questions on Steroids 
 A class of steroid drugs used in premature babies and in pregnant women at risk for a preterm delivery have been found to cause irreversible damage to brain cells in animal studies, USA Today reports.
 The 'Nocebo' Effect
 Consumers may think it's wise to read the warning labels on medications they take, but doing so can trigger the very symptoms they've read about, a phenomenon called the ''nocebo effect,'' The Wall Street Journal reports.
 An Epidemic of Kidney Disease
 The number of Americans suffering from chronic kidney disease, which is caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure and diabetes, has increased to 26 million, up from about 20 million a decade ago, The New York Times reports. One cause, according to researchers: the U.S. population is aging and becoming increasingly obese.
 A Son's Controversial Recovery
 A mother chronicles what she describes as her son's recovery from an autism-spectrum disorder in The Washington Post, saying his is one of a number of cases being studied by researchers. While some children have improved, most seem to have ongoing problems such as social phobias, the author says, and experts are not sure how to define recovery or whether it exists.
 Next, a Push for Health Care Reform
 Tough economic times may spur fundamental health care reform after President-elect Barack Obama takes office, The Los Angeles Times reports. Hospitals are faced with increasing numbers of uninsured patients, businesses are worried about escalating health costs, and some liberal groups see the federal government's bailout package of the financial sector as a relevant precedent.

HEADLINE: An Ad Network in Times Square

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THE medium, Marshall McLuhan once said, is the message. On a familiar building in Times Square, the messages are becoming a medium.
 As the Walgreen Company -- the largest American drugstore chain in sales -- formally opens at 1 Times Square on Thursday, executives are describing plans for the giant signs that will festoon the building on three sides. The signs include some diagonal displays resembling wings as tall as 17 stories. It will also serve as an advertising network of sorts as Walgreen and its sales representative, a unit of ABC, peddle commercial time to other marketers.
 The new one-building network -- WALG, if you will -- is to display ads each day for 20 hours, ceasing their pitches from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. In addition to ads and other promotions for Walgreen, there will be messages from advertisers that produce the kinds of health and beauty items, food products and other merchandise sold in the drugstore. 
 Four advertisers have signed multiyear, multimillion-dollar deals to be charter sponsors of the signs: Colgate-Palmolive, Kraft Foods, Johnson & Johnson and L'Oreal. Ads for Colgate Total toothpaste and several L'Oreal makeup products were visible on Wednesday morning as the signs were being tested.
 In selling ad space on its signs to companies, Walgreen joins a list of Times Square denizens that includes ThomsonReuters and ABC, part of the Walt Disney Company, whose ABC New Media Services unit is handling ad sales for Walgreen.
 The Walgreen signs are indicative of the growing presence in the lives of consumers of new types of advertising outside the home. Media types count the influences on consumers by screens: the TV set is the first screen, the PC is the second and the cellphone or other mobile device the third.
 By that token, a big digital sign chockablock with light-emitting diodes, affixed to a building, bus shelter, mall kiosk, supermarket checkout or gasoline pump, is becoming the fourth screen.
 ''It's about saying 'We're here,' '' said Kim L. Feil, who was recently named the first chief marketing officer at Walgreen, which is based in Deerfield, Ill. The store at 1 Times Square, occupying 16,200 square feet on three levels, replaces one that Walgreen operated at the site from the 1920s until 1970. 
 The ad revenue that ABC New Media Services is to collect for Walgreen from other marketers will help defray the costs of the store. Walgreen is paying more than $4 million a year to lease the building from Sherwood Equities, which is a minority owner in and the manager of 1 Times Square.
 Plans for the store -- the 11th in Manhattan for Walgreen and the 53rd in New York City -- began well before the financial crisis that is slowing sales for just about every retailer in the United States not named Wal-Mart.
 ''We wouldn't be doing it if we didn't think it was a business-wise proposition and a marketing-wise proposition,'' said Ms. Feil, who is also a vice president of Walgreen, which she joined in September from the Sara Lee Company.
 ''It isn't inexpensive,'' she added, declining to discuss specific figures, but it is about opening ''a flagship store'' in ''one of the busiest neighborhoods in America.''
 The store and its gaudy signs, which have 12 million LEDs, are meant to raise the profile of Walgreen, a company that for decades has preferred to operate without public attention.
 ''Walgreen wants to put its flag back into the ground'' at Broadway and 42nd Street, said Arthur Gilmore, president and chief executive at the Gilmore Group in New York, a design and branding agency that devised the signs. The GG Media unit of Gilmore will produce the ads, promotions, video clips and other sign content being sponsored by Walgreen.
 ''We're talking to Wall Street, to shareholders, to customers, that Walgreen is up to something,'' Mr. Gilmore said, ''and moving the company ahead from a brand standpoint.''
 That is why the Walgreen presence on the building is so dominant, he added, joking that when ''you turn that corner'' on the way to 1 Times Square, ''you're going to get a suntan'' from the signs' light.
 Ms. Feil agreed with that approach.
 ''You go to Times Square to be overwhelmed,'' she said. As for the increasing difficulty in standing out in the neighborhood as more signs go up on more buildings, her philosophy is that more is, well, more.
 ''If we're going to go in,'' Ms. Feil said, ''we might as well go big.'' A New Jersey company, D3 LED, is building the signs for Walgreen.
 Other new signs in Times Square -- long known as spectaculars, for their larger-than-life elements -- include a billboard for the Ricoh Americas Corporation at 3 Times Square, designed to be ecologically friendly, and a redesigned LED sign for JVC at 1501 Broadway, to be introduced on Dec. 2.
 The Walgreen signs, which include 13 60-inch plasma screens facing 42nd Street, 7th Avenue and Broadway, will not only burnish the images of the brands advertised on them, said Teresa Rix, vice president for ABC New Media Sales, but ''pull people off the street to purchase products as they walk by.''
 Walgreen will also ''be involved in the 'Good Morning America' concert series in 2009,'' Ms. Rix said. Her division sells the ad space on the giant sign that ABC operates above that show's studio as well as commercials on TaxiTV in New York City taxi cabs and spots on plasma screens in college bookstores as part of the Digital College Network.
 Ads on the Walgreen signs and other Times Square signs are typically sold by the minute, at rates that range from $50 to $75, and scheduled in blocks like two minutes an hour for eight hours a day for eight weeks. The sums can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars for major ad buys.
 The Walgreen signs are above and below the famous news ticker on 1 Times Square, known as the zipper, which was previously sponsored by The New York Times and New York Newsday and is now sponsored by the Dow Jones & Company division of the News Corporation.
 Executives of Walgreen, Gilmore and D3 LED plan to attend a news conference at the store on Thursday morning; the signs are to be officially lighted at 8 p.m.

Commercial Loans
 Are Looking Risky 
 The recent thaw in short-term lending markets made it look, at least temporarily, as if the worst of the credit crisis had passed. But the rapid collapse in the market for commercial-mortgage-backed securities, or C.M.B.S., shows that the American economic downturn is now becoming a big threat, and feeding back to financial assets, which took the brunt of Wednesday's stock market rout. 
 For the top-rated slices of C.M.B.S., risk premiums have ballooned this week. The spread on some triple-A securities, which widens when they fall in value, increased by two percentage points Wednesday alone. 
 Now, they're trading with yields around 13 percent, knocking them down to the same category as junk bonds, despite their top rating. Barclays's investment-grade C.M.B.S. index has fallen about 20 percent over all this month, the sharpest decline ever.
 The acceleration of this collapse over the past couple of days is partly due to the widely publicized potential default of two loans that are held in many C.M.B.S. portfolios. One backs luxury hotels and the other a mall in California. But the recent downdraft is too severe to be attributable to that news alone.
 Rather, the C.M.B.S. slide gained steam after the Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., said last week that the ''troubled asset relief program'' wouldn't buy dodgy mortgage securities off banks' balance sheets. 
 Before then, investors bearish about the commercial real estate sector didn't want to bet against C.M.B.S. for fear the government might swoop in and buy the securities at inflated prices. But when that possibility dimmed, it increased expectations that value of C.M.B.S.'s would decline. 
 Some investors believe the value of C.M.B.S. has fallen farther than the fundamentals of the underlying property market warrant, especially since many C.M.B.S. are insured or have extra collateral. That could be valid, although it sounds a lot like the arguments made a couple of years ago by residential-mortgage-security enthusiasts, who were proven wrong.
 Commercial mortgages have not yet defaulted on the scale of their residential counterparts. Those who pay mortgages on offices, hotels and retail shopping properties usually have deeper pockets than the average homeowner, and often don't run short of cash until after tenants stop paying rent. But with unemployment spiking and consumer spending down, any cushion they may have is getting thinner. C.M.B.S. investors are paying the price for now. But if the erosion in the market continues, so will the rest of the financial system. 
 Flexible Financing
 A financial trick named after the world's most grating musical instrument can't be good. So it is with the so-called accordion feature, an option that lets companies increase their lines of credit with lenders. This peculiar mechanism found its moment in the last wave of leveraged buyouts, used, for example, when Apollo and the Texas Pacific Group acquired Harrah's, and Apollo nabbed Realogy, the real estate brokerage. But these instruments are now being used to play an unexpected tune.
 The idea behind them is to let fast-growing companies add senior debt, secured by specific assets, without having to ask existing senior lenders for approval. In effect, the secured debt slice would simply expand like an accordion. That would be useful for property companies, say, who needed to finance acquisitions fast, and could refinance later. 
 But in the current hard times, the accordions are being used in a different way. Take Realogy, parent of the Coldwell Banker and Corcoran real estate brokerages. Foreseeing a cash shortage, Realogy last week used its secured, senior debt accordion to offer bondholders a shrewd deal at the expense of junior lenders, who will now be paid a lower interest rate and take a loss on their original investment. 
 It's very hard for bondholders to say no to this big loss of principal and interest. If one bondholder doesn't accept the offer, others surely will, putting any party that refused in a bind if things go wrong later. The accordion thus becomes less of an instrument, and more of an ultimatum to suffering lenders. 
 The existing owners of senior secured paper have reason to be piqued too. Their stake is effectively diluted. True, if assets had to be sold, the original lenders would be paid back first. But if there's not enough cash to do even that, these creditors may find they have to fight it out with the newcomers. 
 Anyone who had considered that credit conditions and economies go down as well as up would've shied away from accepting accordion clauses in their loan agreements. But at the top of the market, few lenders prepared for tough times.

HEADLINE: From a Famous Painting, A Jolting Spectacle of Flesh

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
The gam parade at Radio City Music Hall is rolling once again, but this season the Rockettes have some pretty fierce competition in making lively use of the appendages most of us bipeds employ for more mundane purposes. The undulating forest of limbs in Martha Clarke's celebrated ''Garden of Earthly Delights'' may not have the pop appeal of those high kickers uptown, but this singular work of dance theater is without doubt one of the most eerily hypnotic spectacles of flesh in motion ever put on a New York stage.
 Ms. Clarke's theatrical meditation on the famous triptych by Hieronymus Bosch was originally staged in 1984 and reopened at the Minetta Lane Theater in 1987. The new production that opened at the same theater on Wednesday night makes for a kind of homecoming.
 Festive it is not, although the work is shot through with moments of strange, startling beauty. Ms. Clarke's danced drama of the fleeting joys and eternal agonies of the body and the spirit presents man's journey from innocence to experience as a frenzied trek from darkness to darkness, with the heated mystery of human connection as the primary source of light. 
 The Bosch painting, generally dated to 1503-4, depicts a panorama of human pleasure and suffering in three linked panels. It would take a Broadway-size budget and perhaps the entire apparatus of the Disney magic-making machinery to recreate the wild cornucopia of frolicking men, women, animals, fruits and flowers depicted in the central panel of this endlessly weird, endlessly rich work of art. And the lurid horrors of its vision of hell, to the right of the garden party, would tax the ingenuity of the creators of today's blood-soaked video games. (The painting is at the Prado in Madrid.) 
 Ms. Clarke, who conceived, directed and choreographed the show, distills the painting's roiling, boiling imagery with an inspired economy, employing a cast of 11 dancers clad in near-transparent, flesh-colored bodysuits (and later simple medieval costumes); three musicians playing a rhythmic, haunting score by Richard Peaslee; a few tree stumps and spindly, grotesque-looking branches; a little smoke; and some shards of sculptural lighting. (Set and lighting design are by Christopher Akerlind.) Ms. Clarke also uses a single special effect: harnesses for the passages in which the performers take flight, echoing the surreal spatial relationships in the painting.
 While making few attempts at pictorial mimicry, Ms. Clarke sacrifices little of the painting's mystery. Scholars still argue over Bosch's elusive point of view. Are the men and women depicted in a dizzying variety of sexual behaviors in the central panel joyously indulging in the freedom Adam and Eve won at such a steep price? Or are they victims of agonizing lusts that were let loose in the human bloodstream when Eve took that unseemly bite of the forbidden fruit? 
 The torments of hell, depicted with the grisly exuberance that made Bosch so very singular a painter, would seem to suggest that fun definitely has its price, that the chain of experience that began back in paradise with Adam's hungry gaze and Eve's demure self-exposure ultimately will lead to fetters and lashes for just about everybody.
 As Ms. Clarke's theatrical gloss on the painting begins, all you see are limbs in motion as tawny-colored creatures emerge from a primordial darkness to creep slowly across the stage. They are men and women obviously, but as they walk delicately on their toes and fingertips, they seem to be in inchoate form, oversize embryos that haven't yet hatched heads. They look like neckless giraffes, stately and elegant but without recognizable human form or individual identity.
 Such moments of disconcerting confusion come and go quickly in ''Garden of Earthly Delights.'' Was that an act of violence or an act of love I just witnessed? Is that ecstasy or fear playing across the features of that woman? There are moments of humor that slide suddenly into the macabre and moments of horror that are infused with a disarming gracefulness. Pervading all is a dance maker's intuitive sense of finding physical actions to express the lusts, fears and foibles of human experience.
 The performance is nominally divided into three sections, echoing the three panels in the painting. ''Paradise'' depicts Adam (Whitney V. Hunter) and Eve (Sophie Bortolussi) before the Fall, innocent as they walk together in perfect harmony, her feet gracefully placed atop his. When the fatal bite is taken from a bright green apple -- the set's only pop of color -- the dancers onstage suddenly curl into self-conscious slouches and crawl into the corners. Their hands move toward their crotches as if by instinct, to hide the hot source of their shame. 
 The refinement of corruption in the ''Seven Deadly Sins'' section (inspired in part by another Bosch painting) corresponds with a burst of ecclesiastical sound from the musicians -- Wayne Hankin on wind instruments, Egil Rostad on cello, Arthur Solari on percussion -- who are attired in monks' robes and occasionally interact with the other performers. The dancers don simple linen clothing to enact the failings of an early civilization, in vignettes that depict the burning drives of lust, greed, sloth and the rest in sometimes vulgarly comic, sometimes grimly cruel tableaus. 
 Social complicity in acts of brutality is underscored by having the rest of the cast look on with cool diffidence at the carnival of horrors around them. Perhaps the most gasp-inducing image is that of a Christ-like figure being burned at the stake, with Mr. Akerlind's flickering lighting and a small pile of twigs the only props needed to evoke an unforgettably harrowing image.
 With Billy Elliot and Mary Poppins and various characters in the Metropolitan Opera's new production of ''The Damnation of Faust'' hoisted skyward in New York theaters these days, Ms. Clarke's extensive use of aerial work is undoubtedly not as fresh or exciting as it was in the 1980s, before Cirque du Soleil had become a ubiquitous global brand.
 But flight gives the torments of the last section, evoking hell, an extra edge of fantastical horror. The darkness above the stage fills with figures twisting, spinning or simply hanging like slabs of meat in the cosmic darkness. At several points a sufferer is flung beyond the boundary of the stage to spin above the audience. In the tight confines of the Minetta Lane Theater, the effect is seriously spine chilling. Ms. Clarke and her performers create a convincingly fiery vision of hell, and suddenly it's right in your lap.

 U.S. STRIKE REPORTEDLY KILLED FIVE
 In Pakistan, Outside Tribal Areas
 Striking for the first time beyond Pakistan's tribal areas, an American pilotless aircraft fired missiles at a village well inside Pakistani territory, killing five foreign militants, a Pakistani intelligence official and local residents said. The attack appeared to represent a widening of the American campaign aimed at killing militants with Al Qaeda and the Taliban, who use havens in Pakistan as a springboard for attacks against NATO and American soldiers in Afghanistan.

 SANDINISTAS MEET RIVALS IN STREETS
 Homemade mortar rounds exploded over Nicaragua's capital, Managua, and angry demonstrators from rival political parties poured into the streets for a second consecutive day. Opposition leaders accuse President Daniel Ortega's Sandinista party of rigging hundreds of municipal races across the country, including the contest for mayor in Managua. Above, a supporter of the Sandinistas launches a shell from a homemade mortar. PAGE A6 
 BRAWL HALTS IRAQI PARLIAMENT
 A session of Iraq's Parliament collapsed in chaos as a discussion about a three-year security agreement with the United States boiled over into shouting and physical confrontation. The session was dedicated to a second public reading of the agreement, which the Parliament is scheduled to vote on on Monday. PAGE A14 
 SARKOZY CAUSES FLAP
 The announcement by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France that he would hold his own summit meeting in a few weeks in Paris on the financial crisis -- the same topic as the summit meeting just held in Washington -- has caused tension in diplomatic circles. The surfeit of such meetings reflects a tense trans-Atlantic contest over the global economy. PAGE A10 
 EFFORTS TO FIGHT PIRACY
 The commander of American and allied naval forces off the coast of Somalia has begun efforts to halt a spike in piracy, urging merchant vessels to sail with armed guards on board and to travel only within lanes now patrolled by warships. The commander said merchant ship crews were being taught nonviolent measures to prevent pirates from boarding their vessels. PAGE A16 
 AN ADVANCE IN SURGERY IN EUROPE
 Physicians at four European universities have successfully transplanted a human windpipe, using stem cells from the recipient's own bone marrow to reline a donor trachea and prevent its rejection by her immune system, according to an article in a British medical journal. The operation, performed in June, was the first to use stem cells in transplanting an airway. PAGE A8

 ALASKA'S SENATOR-ELECT SAYS
 He'll Be Nicer Than Last One
 Having unseated the longest-serving Republican in Senate history, Mayor Mark Begich of Anchorage said that one of his goals as Alaska's newest United States senator was to be more of a listener and a consensus builder than he said the man he defeated, Senator Ted Stevens, had often been. PAGE A20
 EARLY ROUND TO HOUSE CHALLENGER
 The Democrats' Steering and Policy Committee voted 25-22 in favor of a bid by Representative Henry A. Waxman of California to unseat Representative John D. Dingell of Detroit from his post as chairman of the influential Energy and Commerce Committee. Mr. Dingell's chairmanship now hangs on a vote of the full Democratic caucus, scheduled for Thursday morning. PAGE A30
 HEALTH INSURERS BACK OVERHAUL
 The health insurance industry said it supported an overhaul of the health care system that would require insurers to accept all customers, regardless of illness or disability. But in return, insurers said, Congress should require that all Americans have coverage. In the absence of such a mandate, insurers said, many people will wait until they get sick to buy insurance. PAGE A30
 COURT TO HEAR GAY MARRIAGE CASE
 The California Supreme Court said it would take up the case of whether a voter-approved ban on same-sex unions was constitutional. But it stopped short of delaying the ban, Proposition 8, which California voters approved two weeks ago. The proposition, which overturned a state Supreme Court decision in May that had legalized same-sex marriage, has been challenged by a variety of cities and civil rights groups. PAGE A20
 MANY EYES ON MINNESOTA RECOUNT
 Election officials in Minnesota began to sift through the more than 2.9 million ballots cast in the Senate election. In Hastings, observers for both leading candidates -- Senator Norm Coleman, the Republican, and Al Franken, the Democratic challenger -- were hovering, leaning, and whispering in small circles behind the yellow ''caution'' tape around eight recount tables. Joel Beckman, 52, above, the official assigned to oversee the Dakota County recount, holds up an example of a challenged ballot. PAGE A20

 MAJOR DONOR TO THE ARTS IS CONVICTED OF FRAUD
 Alberto W. Vilar, an investor and music lover accustomed to opulent living, front-row opera seats and the gratitude of arts impresarios, now faces a different prospect: prison. A federal jury in Manhattan convicted him of on all 12 counts on the indictment, including conspiracy and securities fraud, investment adviser fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, making false statements and money laundering. PAGE A33
 ENLISTING SALONS AGAINST VIOLENCE
 A year-old program run by the city in beauty salons in the Washington Heights area is trying to make use of the intimate, often therapeutic relationship between hairdressers and clients to identify and prevent domestic violence, a pervasive problem that victims are often too ashamed to reveal to law enforcement or other public officials. Such a session was held at Diva Salon, where a stylist, Madga Florentino, pointed to where a customer had sustained cigarette burns. PAGE A33 
 SPORTS
 L.P.G.A. SCHEDULE FOR 2009
 Cuts Events and Prize Money
 The 2009 schedule for the L.P.G.A. was released, showing that the tour will be lighter by three tournaments and $5 million in prize money. And it has some other issues, including schedule and sponsor changes and some uncertain purse amounts. But there was a sense of relief among players and officials that the news was not worse.

 ARGENTINA HOSTS DAVIS CUP FINALS
 Argentina is about to host the most significant tennis event ever staged in the country, the Davis Cup final against Spain, beginning Friday. Absent will be the red clay courts the Argentines call polvo de ladrillo (brick dust), long associated with the game there. Of perhaps more import, though, will be the absence of Rafael Nadal, the world's No. 1 player who withdrew from Spain's team last week. PAGE B13
 OFFICIALS SAY MUSSINA WILL RETIRE
 Mike Mussina of the Yankees waited later than anyone else for his first 20-victory season, accomplished in his final start -- and on the last day -- of the Yankees' 2008 season. Apparently, that was enough. Mussina, who turns 40 next month, has decided to retire, according to two officials who have been briefed on his decision. PAGE B12

 BUSINESS
 DOW CLOSES AT LOWEST LEVEL
 In Five Years on Auto Fears
 The Dow Jones industrial average settled below 8,000 for the first time since 2003 after falling 5 percent, to 7,997, as hope dimmed in Washington for an emergency bailout of the auto industry. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was 6.1 percent lower; the Nasdaq fell 6.5 percent. All corners of the market were down, but the financial, transportation and consumer sectors took the heaviest blows. PAGE B1
 DEALS ACROSS THE PACIFIC
 Despite the worldwide economic turndown, the ties between small businesses in China and Southern California, developed in a decade of trade, should continue to grow, business officials say. The volume of trade may be down now, these officials say, but the businesses are thinking of their long-term interests. PAGE B7
 AHEAD OF THE BLACK FRIDAY CURVE
 Shoppers hoping to find the best of the Black Friday sales the day after Thanksgiving would do well to conduct a little research before standing in line through the wee hours of the morning. Those too-good-to-be-true sale items may be gone before you get to them, but other marked-down merchandise may be worth the hunt. The Internet has made finding this information wildly easier. PAGE B5
 EX-HEAD OF BANK OF ITALY ON TRIAL
 As head of the Bank of Italy for 12 years, Antonio Fazio was popular among entrenched Italian bankers, but less so at European Union headquarters. Now, three years after he left the central bank amid scandal, Mr. Fazio, 72, goes on trial in Milan, accused of rigging markets in order to keep Italian banks in Italian hands. PAGE B11

 The problem: how to get more living space on a small plot of land in the Locust Point neighborhood of the Bronx with no space to expand outward and an existing foundation that could not support another floor. Moving was not an option. (What, and give up those spectacular views of Long Island Sound?) The solution: a prefabricated house. PAGE D1

 A GARDEN OF EARTHLY DELIGHTS:
 A Dance of Surreal, Dark Turns
 The leg show is back in full effect at Radio City Music Hall, but the Rockettes are getting some competition for primacy in lower-body expression. ''Garden of Earthly Delights'' might not have the timeless quality of those famous holiday dancers, Charles Isherwood writes, but it's an eerie dance performance based on the triptych by Hieronymous Bosch, a work depicting earthly pleasures, and the unearthly infernal reckoning for indulging in them. Page C1 
 IT'S A HOLLY, SATIRICAL CHRISTMAS
 As it might be put by Stephen Colbert, America has long been without a high-quality Christmas special, and so he is here to oblige. Isn't he amazing? Mr. Colbert, of the satirical news show ''The Colbert Report'' on Comedy Central, helms ''A Colbert Christmas,'' with songs, guests and a call for the beheading of those who don't celebrate Christmas. ... Not really, but it's all in fun, right? Page C3 
 DEAL RELOCATES ARTIFACTS TO ITALY
 An early Renaissance cross and 13 other artifacts are being moved from the Cleveland Museum of Art to Italy. Italy maintains the items were originally looted and brought to the United States in recent decades. The arrangement is similar to four others that Italy has made with American museums over the last three years. Page C3

 RAISE YOUR SPIRITS, 
 And Your Hem Lines
 Poised before the barrel of six months of holiday dreary, and with all that financial turmoil on your plate, you won't have much space for turkey or even cold cuts. So to celebrate having no reason at all to be cheery, shoppers and designers alike are tossing out the idea of dressing appropriately for the economic mess. Short skirts and floral prints are in, but with a conservative eye for price. And nothing that screams: ''fashion!'' Page E1 
 ALL IN THAT HAT YOU WEAR
 Hats are probably never going to see the popularity they did a half-century ago, when they were an essential item for everybody from ad men to Philip Marlow. But there has been a resurgence. Wide-brim swingers have been flying off the shelves along with Sonia Rykiel's bowlers that look like pieces of candy. Like everything, though, it's not what but how that makes it work. Page E11

 FLUNKING THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE
 The Electoral College is more than just an antiquated institution born of the politics of slavery. It actively disenfranchises voters and occasionally (think 2000) makes the candidate with fewer popular votes the president. American democracy would be far stronger without it. PAGE A42
 SO MR. SKELOS, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN?
 Gov. David Paterson of New York tried bravely this week to get a handle on the state's budget deficit before it begins to spin completely out of control. But the forces that have given Albany its reputation for ineptitude won out. PAGE A42
 LEGAL BILLS
 The Justice Department has reportedly agreed to hire a private attorney to represent former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in a federal lawsuit accusing him of politicized hiring. It may be appropriate, if galling, to think that taxpayers will pay for his private counsel. What is clearly inappropriate is the department's refusal to make the arrangement public. PAGE A42

 NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF
 The United States needs to get over its crush on Georgia's president, the charismatic Misha. And if a new cold war is to be avoided, President-elect Barack Obama needs a new approach to Russia. Poking badly behaved bears is no substitute for sober diplomacy. PAGE A43
 WHAT'S SO SPECIAL ABOUT RIVALS?
 Inspired by the example of Abraham Lincoln, President-elect Barack Obama is considering appointing a ''team of rivals'' to his cabinet. But the discussion of Lincoln misses two big points, writes James Oakes, the author of ''The Radical and the Republican: Frederick Douglass, Abraham Lincoln and the Triumph of Antislavery Politics.'' First, putting political foes in cabinet positions has a long history in American politics that predates Lincoln. Second, it doesn't always work out so well. PAGE A43

HEADLINE: What's the Value of a Big Bonus?

BYLINE: By DAN ARIELY. 
Dan Ariely, a professor of behavioral economics at Duke, is the author of ''Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions.''

DATELINE: Durham, N.C. 

 BODY:
 BY withholding bonuses from their top executives, Goldman Sachs and UBS may soften negative reaction from Congress and the public if their earnings reports in December are poor, as is expected. But will they also suffer because their executives, lacking the motivation that big bonuses are thought to provide, will not do their jobs well?
 Of course, there are many reasons to be disgusted with executive pay. It feels unfair that so many people make so much money managing our money, and it is often difficult to see how their talent and abilities justify their compensation. We find it particularly offensive when executives receive high bonuses after disastrous performances. But doesn't the promise of a big bonus push people to work to the best of their ability? 
 To look at this question, three colleagues and I conducted an experiment. We presented 87 participants with an array of tasks that demanded attention, memory, concentration and creativity. We asked them, for instance, to fit pieces of metal puzzle into a plastic frame, to play a memory game that required them to reproduce a string of numbers and to throw tennis balls at a target. We promised them payment if they performed the tasks exceptionally well. About a third of the subjects were told they'd be given a small bonus, another third were promised a medium-level bonus, and the last third could earn a high bonus.
 We did this study in India, where the cost of living is relatively low so that we could pay people amounts that were substantial to them but still within our research budget. The lowest bonus was 50 cents -- equivalent to what participants could receive for a day's work in rural India. The middle-level bonus was $5, or about two weeks' pay, and the highest bonus was $50, five months' pay. 
 What would you expect the results to be? When we posed this question to a group of business students, they said they expected performance to improve with the amount of the reward. But this was not what we found. The people offered medium bonuses performed no better, or worse, than those offered low bonuses. But what was most interesting was that the group offered the biggest bonus did worse than the other two groups across all the tasks. 
 We replicated these results in a study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where undergraduate students were offered the chance to earn a high bonus ($600) or a lower one ($60) by performing one task that called for some cognitive skill (adding numbers) and another one that required only a mechanical skill (tapping a key as fast as possible). We found that as long as the task involved only mechanical skill, bonuses worked as would be expected: the higher the pay, the better the performance. But when we included a task that required even rudimentary cognitive skill, the outcome was the same as in the India study: the offer of a higher bonus led to poorer performance. 
 If our tests mimic the real world, then higher bonuses may not only cost employers more but also discourage executives from working to the best of their ability.
 We later did a variation of the same experiment, at the University of Chicago, to look at a different kind of motivator: public scrutiny. We asked 39 participants to solve anagram puzzles, sometimes privately in a cubicle and sometimes in front of the others. We reasoned that their motivation to do well would be higher in public, and we wanted to see if this would affect their performance. But we found that while the subjects wanted to perform better when they worked in front of others, in fact they did worse. 
 So it turns out that social pressure has the same effect that money has. It motivates people, especially when the tasks at hand require only effort and no skill. But it can provide stress, too, and at some point that stress overwhelms the motivating influence. 
 When I recently presented these results to a group of banking executives, they assured me that their own work and that of their employees would not follow this pattern. (I pointed out that with the right research budget, and their participation, we could examine this assertion. They weren't that interested.) But I suspect that they were too quick to discount our results. For most bankers, a multimillion-dollar compensation package could easily be counterproductive. Maybe that will be some comfort to the boards at UBS and Goldman Sachs.

HEADLINE: STOCKS ARE HURT BY LATEST FEAR: DECLINING PRICES

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Jack Healy and Stephanie Rosenbloom contributed reporting.

 BODY:
After gyrating wildly for weeks, the stock market lurched lower on Wednesday, falling to its lowest point in nearly six years, as concern spread that the economy might be facing a chronic and debilitating decline in prices.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed below 8,000 for the first time since early 2003 after new reports painted a grim picture of the economy and raised the specter of deflation, which would put more strain on hard-pressed businesses and workers.
The Labor Department reported that prices of consumer goods and services fell by a record amount in October, while another report showed that a measure of home building fell for the fourth straight month, to its lowest level in the 49 years that the government has kept that data.
While most consumers might welcome the idea that things are getting cheaper, deflation is an economists' nightmare. It was a hallmark of the Depression and Japan's so-called lost decade in the 1990s. A big worry is that deflation would blunt the impact of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, forcing policy makers to use other tools to try to revive the economy. 
The Consumer Price Index, a measure of how much Americans pay for groceries, entertainment and other goods and services, fell by 1 percent in October, to an annualized rate of 3.7 percent, according to the Labor Department. It was the biggest one-month drop in the 61-year history of the index and the lowest annualized gain since October of last year.
Much of the decline could be traced to a 14 percent drop in the price of gasoline, but the cost of other goods -- including clothes, milk and vegetables -- also fell sharply.
The vice chairman of the Fed, Donald L. Kohn, said that the risk of deflation, defined as a ''general decline in prices,'' remained slight but had increased. ''Whatever I thought that risk was, four or five months ago, I think it is bigger now even if it is still small,'' Mr. Kohn said in response to a question after a speech. The Fed, he added, would be aggressive, if necessary, to prevent a broad drop in prices.
Stocks started falling shortly after 10 a.m. and ground their way down for much of the day before tumbling sharply in the last hour of trading. The broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 6.1 percent, to 806.58, falling below a low it set on Oct. 27. The index is now only 37 points above its October 2002 low. The Dow dropped 427.47, or 5.1 percent, to 7,997.28.
Financial shares led the market down, with Citigroup falling by more than 23 percent and Bank of America closing down 14 percent. General Motors and the Ford Motor Company also tumbled as prospects for a federal aid packaged looked grim. ''That spooked investors quite a bit,'' said Sam Stovall, chief equity strategist at Standard & Poor's Equity Research. ''G.M. and Citigroup, two venerable companies, are right now on the ropes.''
In the credit market, the price of corporate debt and bonds backed by commercial mortgages plummeted, while government bonds rallied as investors sought safe havens. The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, fell to 3.32 percent, from 3.53 on Tuesday.
Analysts say a sustained decline in consumer prices would be terrible for the economy. Businesses that cut prices to attract buyers are likely to have to lay off workers as well. They may also have little left over to pay lenders or shareholders.
Prices are falling outside the United States too. Consumer prices declined in Britain, France, Germany and elsewhere in Europe in October, and prices were flat in September in Japan, which has fought deflation on and off for nearly two decades.
The decline in consumer prices is all the more remarkable because this summer many economists were concerned about inflation and the prospect for stagflation, in which inflation and unemployment rise simultaneously, contrary to their usual relationship. ''It's funny that just a few months ago everyone was wringing their hands over inflation,'' said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at Global Insight. ''It's gone. It's over.''
But that concern has been quickly dashed, in large part because of a steep drop in commodity prices. Crude oil prices, for instance, have fallen more than 63 percent from their July peak of $145.29 a barrel, to $53.62 on Wednesday. The national average price for unleaded gasoline is now $2.05 a gallon, down from $2.92 a month earlier, according to AAA, the auto club.
In fact, it now seems clear that the nation is entering a more frugal era after several years of conspicuous consumption.
For instance, room rates at luxury hotels fell 5.4 percent in the 28 days ending on Nov. 15 -- in contrast to a 1.3 percent increase in rates at midscale hotels that do not serve food, estimated Smith Travel Research, a firm that studies the industry. Over all, hotel prices fell 1.6 percent in October, according to the Labor Department.
High-end retailers are resorting to drastic discounting to lure customers into stores. Executives at Nordstrom, the department store chain, said on a recent conference call with analysts that the company had lowered prices on more than 800 clothing styles by an average of 22 percent.
Airfares, which were rising along with energy prices this summer, are now sliding as airlines struggle to fill seats on many popular routes. The average price of a one-way ticket is down about 20 percent from July, to $107 in mid-November, according to Harrell Associates, a firm that tracks the airline industry.
Still, the so-called core price index -- which excludes energy and food -- was down a more modest 0.1 percent. The prices of goods and services like meat, alcohol, medical care and education increased in October.
''It would take significant and persistent contraction in the economy to push core inflation into negative territory,'' said Dean Maki, an economist at Barclays Capital in New York. ''We do not think that is likely, especially given the aggressive policy response on the part of the Fed and Treasury.''
The Fed has already cut its benchmark interest rate to 1 percent from 5.25 percent last year, and it has been lending hundreds of billions of dollars to banks and corporations in recent months to revive credit markets. The Treasury has also pumped nearly $300 billion into banks and other financial firms.
The Fed is anticipating significant further slowing in the economy. A report released on Wednesday shows that the Fed now expects 2009 growth to be 1.8 percent to minus 1 percent, down from a previous forecast of growth of 1.9 percent to 3 percent.
Even though the Fed's target interest rate is close to zero, economists say there is much more the central bank and the government can do to revive the economy. In a speech in 2002, before he was the chairman of the Fed, Ben S. Bernanke said central banks could combat deflation by buying longer-term Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to drive down interest rates.
''The Fed is going to ram liquidity into the financial system whether it is asking for it or not, just going out and buying assets and printing money in order to do it,'' said Alan D. Levenson, chief economist at T. Rowe Price. ''If you jam money into everyone's pocket, they will spend it.''
Furthermore, lawmakers in Washington are also expected to pass a significant fiscal stimulus package in January after the new administration and Congress take power. Policy makers could head off deflation by spending hundreds of billions of dollars on tax breaks, infrastructure projects and other initiatives.

HEADLINE: Defying Slump, Developers Plan 60-Story Hospital Industry Center on West Side

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
A major hospital trade association, one of New York City's most aggressive developers and a financier with a personal interest in health care are teaming up in hopes of building a 60-story glass-and-steel tower on the West Side of Manhattan that would function as an international showcase and permanent conference center for the hospital industry.
 The partners -- the Greater New York Hospital Association, Extell and Israel Green, a deep-pocketed investor little known outside the real estate industry -- say the building would open in late 2013 and would serve as an anchor building for the Hudson Yards, more than 50 blocks of riverfront stretching from West 28th Street to West 43rd Street that make up one of the last parcels of underused land in Manhattan. The Bloomberg administration originally wanted to put a $2 billion football stadium for the Jets on the site, but that notion was blocked by the State Legislature. 
 Real estate projects all over New York City have been stalled or stopped in their tracks because of the shrinking credit market. But the backers of the World Product Centre, as the tower would be called, say that the prospects for their project -- estimated to cost $500 million to $1 billion to build -- are uniquely auspicious because the health care industry has proven in the past to be countercyclical and recession-proof, since people always get sick.
 In interviews on Wednesday, the developers or their representatives said they imagined the building as a permanent exhibition center for hundreds of vendors to the medical industry, from hospital food and furniture suppliers to pharmaceutical companies and makers of X-ray machines and surgical devices. They have assembled a team of salespeople to begin marketing the 10-year leases that would help secure the financing for the building, focusing their attention on some of the country's largest health care companies, like Cardinal Health Care, a Fortune 20 company with $90 billion in annual revenue.
 Situated on the east side of 11th Avenue between 33rd and 34th Streets, where the now-demolished Copacabana nightclub once stood, cater-corner from the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, the tower would also house the headquarters of the hospital association, now located on West 57th Street.
 ''From an economic development aspect, it's more important than ever to do a building like this, because New York City's future can't be continued reliance on Wall Street,'' said Marc V. Shaw, executive vice president for strategic planning at Extell, the development company, and a former budget director in the Giuliani administration and former chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
 The Bloomberg administration has embraced the project as part of its efforts to wean New York City's economic base away from the financial industry, which has been its mainstay, and as a way to bolster the tourism industry by filling hotel rooms with medical executives during the off-season.
 Robert C. Lieber, deputy mayor for economic development, said in an e-mail message on Wednesday, ''New York City has all the makings of a major hub of commercial bioscience activity -- more than 70 hospitals, top medical research institutions, the most talented work force in the nation -- and we see the industry as a prime opportunity to grow and diversify the economy.''
 Lee H. Perlman, president of the for-profit venture arm of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said the centralized location would address Congressional concerns that the financial relationship between hospitals and doctors and their suppliers, including drug and medical device companies, has become too cozy and insulated from public scrutiny. 
 But real estate executives and others said it would be an uphill fight to convince potential financial backers of the project's potential to succeed in bleak economic times. They noted that the International Toy Center, a similar concept, failed and is now being converted into offices and residences.
 One executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of alienating Extell said he found it hard to believe that enough companies would commit to 10-year leases in the current market to make the project financially viable. ''Under normal conditions, Israel Green and Extell could -- and did -- raise a lot of money,'' the executive said. ''They are as smart as they come.''
 But he said that over the next 12 months, space would become cheaper to lease, and that it might make more sense to lease than to build. ''There is nothing getting done or built that's over $100 million these days, because you simply cannot get the lenders together to fund it,'' the executive said. ''In fact very little is being done above $75 million. When you're looking into a crystal ball, a year to a year and a half looks to us like a train wreck just beginning to hit.''
 Anna Levin, chairwoman of the Clinton-Hell's Kitchen Land Use Committee for Community Board 4, said the infrastructure for Hudson Yards could not yet support a 60-story building, and that infrastructure construction -- including the extension of the No. 7 subway -- was likely to fall behind schedule because of the sagging economy. 
 ''It may not be a stupid idea, but at this point I think it's kind of an isolated idea, wrapped up in a whole bunch of uncertainties,'' Ms. Levin said of the plan for the World Product Centre. ''It's all still a pretty picture, but with no reality behind it yet, and this smells to me like the city is trying to create some reality.''
 The World Product Centre was jointly conceived by Mr. Perlman and Mr. Green. Mr. Green and a partner, Joseph Neumann, owned the Salmon Tower, a 59-story office building at 500 Fifth Avenue, at 42nd Street, in the 1980s. Mr. Green said he became interested in health care after his wife was found to have thyroid cancer 10 years ago, and that he had originally hoped to build the World Product Centre near the World Trade Center -- hence the word ''Centre'' in its name -- a plan that was dashed by the 2001 terrorist attack. 
 The developers said that the building would have 1 million square feet of space and 1,800 showrooms, but that a typical company would occupy two or three showrooms. Mr. Perlman said that the backers needed 10-year commitments from about 600 companies to make the financing work, and that they would need to sign up about 200 to start construction.
 Mr. Perlman said that several companies had expressed interest, though none had yet signed a lease. ''We have 18 months to do it, and that's our goal,'' he said.
 Mark Rosenbaum, an executive at Cardinal Health, based in Ohio, said the company, with 2,500 sales representatives, has showrooms in Columbus and San Diego, and often shows clients its products in use at places like the Cleveland Clinic or the Mayo Clinic. ''I think it makes sense,'' Mr. Rosenbaum said of the World Product Centre. ''We are certainly interested in it, and we are very seriously considering what it might mean to us.''
 Mr. Shaw said the developers were not asking for government financing at this point, though they might look for tax breaks down the road. He said the building would finance itself through leases that would ''replace the conventional bond that's hard to get right now.''
 Besides the showplaces and trade association headquarters, the tower would include a 500-seat auditorium, work spaces for visiting businesspeople, and a training and education center for the hospital industry.

HEADLINE: An Eye on Growth, Deals Stretch Across the Pacific

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN. 
This column about small-business trends in California and the West appears on the third Thursday of every month. E-mail: jamesflanigan@nytimes.com

 BODY:
THE ties between small businesses in China and Southern California, developed in a decade of trade through the ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach, should continue to grow, business officials say, despite the worldwide downturn. 
 The volume of trade may be down now, these officials say, but the businesses are thinking of their long-term interests. 
 ''In the global recession, Chinese companies are looking around the world to acquire knowledge,'' said Donald H. Straszheim, an economist and vice chairman of Roth Capital Partners, an investment bank in Newport Beach, Calif., that has arranged financing for companies in China. 
 So there are companies like Shanghai Tiqiao Textile and Yarn Dyeing, a fabric manufacturer, which is investing $2 million to acquire 26 percent of the Cynthia Vincent fashion house in Los Angeles. ''Profit margins are very bad now for textile makers in China,'' Yu Ming Pan, the company's president, said during a recent visit to Los Angeles. ''We want to acquire branding and marketing know-how in this market.''
 Shanghai Textile is also investing in Vicarious by Nature, a designer of sportswear made from organic fabrics in Los Angeles. The idea is to have both an outlet for Shanghai's fabrics in these American companies but also to export American ideas about fashion to China. 
 ''We will be investing in more companies, looking to the time when China's domestic market becomes a major consumer of fashion,'' said Stacy Sun, a business consultant in Pasadena who represents Shanghai Textile. She predicted that China's consumer economy would grow significantly over five to six years. 
 At the same time, a small company in Irvine, Calif., the Composite Technology Corporation, expects its business to grow because China is planning to spend $586 billion in infrastructure development to spur its flagging economy. 
 Composite makes carbon fiber cables for electric power transmission that are lighter than steel and allow more current to be transmitted for each mile of line. So far this year, the company has sold more than $12 million in cable to its Chinese distributor, the Jiang-su Far East Group, and it looks forward to more business with China and other developing countries. It is expanding its Irvine manufacturing plant for carbon fiber cables. 
 ''The demand for transmission lines is growing because electric power is the absolute necessity for all other economic development,'' said Marvin Sepe, chief operating officer of Composite and a metallurgical engineer. The company was founded six years ago by entrepreneurs with experience in the aerospace and military industries in Southern California. Its business in China was arranged through Jack Chen, an investment banker in Los Angeles whose firm, the Transworld Consulting Group, has offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Arcadia, Calif.
 To nurture the ties between the small businesses in China and California, Mr. Straszheim's company, Roth Capital, is bringing executives from 70 Chinese companies to a conference in Las Vegas this week to meet with American investment managers.
 Still, it is not an easy time to raise money. ''If you have a great prospect that will develop over four to five years, we couldn't do that now,'' said Byron Roth, chairman of the company. ''But if you have something that is ready to go right now, it can be financed.''
 Among the companies Roth Capital is featuring at the conference is the ChinaCast Education Corporation, a nine-year-old company that offers college-level lessons over the Internet and by satellite throughout China, particularly to rural areas. ChinaCast has $30 million in annual revenue and 1,200 employees. 
 Roth Capital has also backed China Water and Drinks Inc., a company that collaborates with soft drink bottling plants to distribute water at 14 to 15 cents a bottle throughout the country. China Water was acquired this year by the Heckmann Corporation of Palm Desert, Calif. 
 Roth Capital has also raised financing for Zhongpin Inc., a meatpacking company that distributes fresh and frozen pork products throughout China. Interest in China's development remains high, Mr. Roth said. 
 ''Times are hard, but we have more investment companies coming to this China conference than came to the first one we held, in 2007,'' he said. 
 His firm is not alone in providing a financing link across the Pacific. Etech Securities, a 10-year-old investment and brokerage firm in Pasadena, also connects investors in the United States with companies in China. ''We are long-term investors,'' said N. Jay Liang, president and chief executive of Etech. ''Chinese companies want to acquire management talent and know-how.'' 
 In the area of China's environmental needs, Mr. Liang said that Etech had raised capital for two major water treatment companies, Jin Da Lai Waste Equipment, the largest company in industrial waste water treatment in China, and Southern Waste Water Treatment. 
 At the beginning of November, Etech Securities held an equity investment forum in Chongqing, a city of 32 million people in western China that has increased in economic importance since the Three Gorges Dam hydroelectric project gave the city abundant electric power.
 To be sure, conducting business with China remains difficult in some areas. Frankie Fook-lun Leung, a lawyer in Los Angeles who lectures at Hong Kong University, predicted that piracy of entertainment media and software would continue for a decade or until China concludes that piracy of intellectual property harms its own economy. 
 Yet law firms like Morrison & Foerster, Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker, and the USA China Law Group, working through offices in China and Southern California, continue to pioneer dispute resolutions across legal frontiers and disciplines. 
 And continuing business contacts have fostered optimism about long-term opportunities for California businesses in China's development. 
 ''When I go to China, I get a sense of optimism that I last saw in the early 1950s in America,'' said James McClain, a marketing executive who is a co-founder of Global Development Partners with Richard Zhou, a former official of China's ministries of electric power and railroads. Together, Mr. McClain and Mr. Zhou have built a healthy business with $1 million in annual revenue that provides detailed research reports on China's industrial needs in fertilizers, energy and raw materials. 
 Global Development Partners also has introduced Kryton, a product that waterproofs cement, to China's building industry. And Global Development Partners is now trying to gain approval for vitamin and biofiber nutritional products. ''There is great receptivity in China for health products,'' Mr. McClain said.

HEADLINE: Shares Near 6-Year Low, With More Losses Feared

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
As the stock market tumbled to its lowest level in nearly six years on Wednesday, Wall Street traders and many ordinary Americans were asking the same question: Where, oh where is the bottom? 
 After a yearlong slide in stocks and a giant bank rescue from Washington, even some pessimists had hoped that the worst might be over. But now, after the Dow Jones industrial average fell below 8,000 on Wednesday, the financial crisis and the bear market it spawned seem to be taking a new, painful turn. 
 Once again, investors' confidence in the nation's financial industry is draining away. And once again, people are rushing for ultra-safe investments like Treasuries. Many analysts agree that the short-term outlook seems grim now that the Dow has fallen below 8,000, a level that had lured buyers again and again in recent weeks. 
 ''When you break through these kinds of levels, it strongly suggests there's more to go,'' said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research.
 But how much more to go? Dow 7,000? Dow 6,000? Many analysts are reluctant to say, having been proved wrong so many times before. The Dow has lost nearly 40 percent this year, and many of its blue chips, from Alcoa to General Electric, are down even more than that. 
 Much will depend on the course of the economy, but there is little good news on that front. On Wednesday, a new report raised concern that the economy might be beset by a debilitating decline in prices, or deflation. 
 But another big worry is that the credit markets, where this crisis began, are coming under even more stress than they were before. Junk bonds, for instance, fell to their lowest levels on record on Wednesday, driving the average yield on these high-risk corporate bonds to more than 20 percent. Yields on Treasury bills, meantime, fell to nearly zero. Investors were willing to accept almost no return just to know their money was safe. 
 The Treasury's benchmark 10-year bill rose 1 25/32, to 103 20/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.32 percent, down from 3.53 percent late Tuesday.
 Another source of concern is a possible new round of forced sales by hedge funds, seeking to raise the cash quickly to meet margin calls and redemptions of assets by investors.
 Few stocks escaped unscathed. Shares of small and midsize companies fell, as well as those of Wal-Mart, the retailer. Energy companies plunged, as did airlines, fast-food chains and pharmaceutical companies.
 But it was financial stocks that bore the brunt of the selling, and, for many analysts, seem the most worrisome. Financial shares are plunging far below the levels plumbed in October, when panic gripped the markets. On Wednesday, Citigroup, the hobbled financial giant, plunged 23.4 percent to a mere $6.40 in an avalanche of sell orders. Once the most valuable financial company in America, Citigroup is now worth less than U.S. Bancorp.
 Big banks like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo & -- all of which, like Citigroup, have received billions of dollars from the government -- fell more than 10 percent. 
 Goldman Sachs, the former employer of Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, sank to its lowest level since it went public in 1999. Analysts predicted that Goldman, the most profitable bank in Wall Street history, would suffer its first loss as a public company.
 Even Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, which owns the Geico Corporation and recently invested in Goldman Sachs, fell 12 percent, its steepest decline in more than two decades. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 427.47 points or 5.07 percent, at 7,997.28. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed down 6.12 percent or 52.54 points at 806.58 while the technology-heavy Nasdaq ended down 6.53 percent at 1,386.42.
 But even as markets tumbled, analysts saw few signs of capitulation, that final burst of panicked selling that typically marks a market bottom. If anything, Wednesday's new lows are a sign that Wall Street has farther to fall.
 ''The market is still anticipating that we have not seen the worst,'' said Ryan Larson, head equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management. 
 After precipitous declines this autumn, Wall Street had spent the past weeks testing its yearly lows by dipping sharply, only to rebound late in the day. The testing and retesting prompted some optimists to hope that the markets had finally found a foothold.
 But Wednesday's drop proved them wrong.
 A gathering mass of bleak economic conditions seemed to approach the critical point, as fears of deflation and the auto industry's waning prospects of a federal bailout drove financial markets into an afternoon selling frenzy. 
 Auto shares fell as the leaders of the three American automakers reprised their appearance on Capitol Hill to discuss an emergency bailout and the threat of bankruptcy. General Motors was down 10 percent, to $2.79 a share, and the Ford Motor Company was down 25 percent, to $1.26.
 Crude oil settled at a 22-month low at $53.62 a barrel, and energy stocks followed them lower. 
 Wednesday's losses followed news that consumer prices dropped 1 percent in October, a record one-month decline, according to the Labor Department. Energy prices, which tumbled 8.6 percent over the month, led the declines. 
 Meanwhile, housing starts in October fell 4.5 percent to a seasonally adjusted 791,000 from the prior month, the government reported on Wednesday. For the year, housing starts were down 38 percent and building permits were 40 percent lower, reflecting how the housing industry has slammed to a halt amid tumbling home values, slumping sales and tighter credit markets.
 Asian stock markets opened sharply lower on Thursday. Trade data from Japan, Asia's largest economy, showed big drops in exports compared with a year ago. The Nikkei 225 index in Japan dropped 4.3 percent soon after the opening. Similar falls were seen in South Korea, where the Kospi fell 3.9 percent.

HEADLINE: German Chemical Maker BASF Cuts Output

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
The giant German chemical company BASF said Wednesday that it would temporarily halt or slow production at 180 plants around the world as it adjusted to a ''massive decline in demand'' brought by the economic turmoil. 
 The company, based in Ludwigshafen, Germany, said demand in the automotive, construction and textile industries had declined sharply in recent months, necessitating the need to reduce overcapacity. The company will review its business in January and decide whether conditions warrant returning the plants to full production.
 Like other industrial companies, BASF has had to grapple with a sudden economic downturn that began in the second half of the year.
 ''There is currently no demand for chemical products,'' Peter Spengler, an analyst who covers the chemical industry at DZ Bank in Frankfurt, said. ''The customer base is almost nonexistent in the fourth quarter because of inventory drawdown.''
 Mr. Spengler said that chemical companies had been hoping that Chinese demand would help to pick up the slack from Europe and the United States, but that it had failed to materialize.
 Andrew Liveris, chief executive of Dow Chemical, said last week that he expected ''a pretty protracted global recession, probably going into 2010.''
 At BASF, the move will reduce output by 20 percent to 25 percent, a company spokesman, Gareth Rees, said. BASF is ''temporarily shutting down'' about 80 plants and will reduce production at another 100 plants.
 About 20,000 employees will be affected by the production cuts, Mr. Rees said, with many of them facing involuntary vacations during the year-end holiday period. BASF, which posted sales of almost 58 billion euros, or $73 billion, in 2007, has more than 95,000 employees worldwide.
 The cuts will affect production of ammonia, styrene and polyamide, which are precursors for engineering plastics, coatings and fibers. Output will be affected in Asia, Europe and North America, but not South America.
 Jurgen Hambrecht, the BASF chairman, said in a statement that the economic situation had gotten much worse, as ''customer demand in key markets has declined significantly.''
 BASF's earnings will fall below 2007 levels, Mr. Hambrecht said. ''How the coming year will develop is difficult to foresee. BASF is preparing for tough times.''

HEADLINE: Report Says Rutgers Athletics Lacked Proper Oversight

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
The president of Rutgers, Richard L. McCormick, failed to adequately oversee the university athletic director on critical issues like the football coach Greg Schiano's salary and the hiring of a sports marketing firm that once employed the athletic director's son, according to an often harshly worded report released Wednesday by an independent review committee. 
 There is ''no question that the president's failure to exercise fully his ultimate authority on these matters, to seek the counsel of the board in certain instances, and to test the basis of [athletic department] decisions exacerbated this situation,'' read the report, which also sharply criticized the athletic director, Robert E. Mulcahy III. 
 The committee's conclusions came several months after The Star-Ledger of Newark published articles reporting that Schiano received an extra $250,000 a year from a sports marketing firm that had employed Mulcahy's son, and that the State Legislature directed $2.25 million over four years to the athletic department. 
 The revelations followed a decade-long quest by Rutgers to transform its athletic department -- especially its football team -- into a contender in college sports. The university is in the second phase of a $102 million project to expand its stadium, although officials have said those plans are almost certain to be scaled back in the wake of the economic crisis.
 Alfred C. Koeppe, a co-chairman of the nine-member review committee, said the rapid growth of the athletics department contributed to the troubles he investigated. ''You had these stresses that came with the very quick maturation of the program itself, and you had a structure that had weaknesses in it,'' Koeppe said. 
 The committee found that while the employment of Mulcahy's son did not technically constitute a conflict of interest, Mulcahy should have disclosed the fact to the university. It also concluded that Mulcahy was given few instructions when he was hired by the university in 1998. That, combined with lax oversight by the board of directors and McCormick, led to a culture of secrecy, the committee said.
 ''I think the structure had its flaws right from the start because the internal controls were really not there,'' Koeppe said. ''And then you had some challenges that clearly the athletic director had in terms of operating in an insular manner.''
 In a statement Wednesday, McCormick said the report was ''consistent with what I had hoped for when I appointed the committee last summer,'' later adding, ''I applaud their work and welcome their recommendations.
 Some of the recommendations that McCormick says he will carry out include expanding the size of the university's Internal Audit Department, requiring written contracts for coaches that spell out all types of compensation, and requiring presidential approval of all head coaches. 
 In a statement, Mulcahy said he would work with the president and the board to act on the recommendations. His contract with Rutgers expires in 2010.

HEADLINE: Book Prizes Awarded With Nod To History

BYLINE: By MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Annette Gordon-Reed won the National Book Award for nonfiction on Wednesday night for ''The Hemingses of Monticello: An American Family,'' a sweeping, prodigiously researched biography of three generations of a slave family owned by Thomas Jefferson.
 Ms. Gordon-Reed, who celebrated her 50th birthday on the night of the awards, was the first African-American author to win the prize for nonfiction since Orlando Patterson won for ''Freedom'' in 1991. ''I can't say what a wonderful November this has been,'' she said. ''It's sort of wonderful to have the book come out at this time. People ask me if I planned it this way; I didn't. All of America -- we're on a great journey now and I look forward to the years to come.'' The book was published by W. W. Norton. 
 In the fiction category, Peter Matthiessen won for ''Shadow Country,'' a one-volume compilation of three previously released but revised and condensed novels based on the life of Edgar J. Watson, a 19th century ruthless cane farmer in Florida who was said to be a serial killer. It was published by Modern Library.
 A National Book Award winner in 1979 for his nonfiction work ''The Snow Leopard,'' Mr. Matthiessen said, ''I've had a hard time over the years persuading people that fiction was my natural thing,'' and then raised his bronze statue above his head. 
 The awards, celebrating their 59th year, were presented at a black-tie dinner for the first time at Cipriani's Wall Street in Manhattan, on a day when the Dow Jones industrial average fell to its lowest level in five years. Harold Augenbraum, executive director of the National Book Foundation, said that despite the economic climate, there were nearly 700 attendees, 50 more than last year, paying up to $12,000 per table.
 Eric Bogosian, the writer and actor, was the host of the ceremony, taking a political tone in his remarks. Congratulating President-elect Barack Obama, he said, ''As far I know, Barack Obama is a reader,'' adding, ''hopefully we will have a president who reads history and hopefully is not condemned to repeat it.''
 This year's winners received a bronze statue and $10,000.
 The prize for young people's literature was awarded to Judy Blundell for ''What I Saw and How I Lied,'' a noirish novel published by Scholastic Press about a teenage girl who enters into a complex relationship with a soldier who served with her father during World War II.
 Ms. Blundell, who has spent most of her career as a writer for hire, said this was the ''first book I put my name on.''
 Mark Doty won the award for poetry for ''Fire to Fire,'' a collection of poems from seven previous volumes.
 A National Book Award can help fuel sales. ''The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian'' by Sherman Alexie, which won the young people's fiction award last year, has sold 128,000 copies in hardcover, according to Nielsen BookScan, which tracks about 70 percent of sales. It has remained on the New York Times best-seller list for children's chapter books for 48 weeks. 
 Maxine Hong Kingston, the author of ''The Woman Warrior,'' was awarded the 2008 Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters. 
 Barney Rosset, the publisher of Grove Press and The Evergreen Review, a literary magazine, received the 2008 Literarian Award for Outstanding Service to the American Literary Community. Hunched over and walking with a cane, Mr. Rosset, 86, received a standing ovation. He spoke of his victorious fight to publish ''Tropic of Cancer'' by Henry Miller and praised the election of Mr. Obama. 
 ''The country looks like it may emerge from these dark decades with a new and uplifting agenda,'' Mr. Rosset said, adding that he hoped publishing ''now will go through a similar renewal.'' 
 ''I hope so,'' he said. ''I think so.''

HEADLINE: So Mr. Skelos, What's Your Plan?

 BODY:
Gov. David Paterson tried bravely this week to get a handle on New York State's budget deficit, before it spins completely out of control. But the forces that have given Albany its reputation for ineptitude -- cowardice and partisanship -- prevailed. 
 The governor had called a one-day emergency session to get the State Senate and Assembly to vote on a package of $2 billion in savings, including cuts to Medicaid, the education budget and the state university system. Such cuts are politically unpopular but absolutely essential, as the state struggles with the worst economic outlook since the Great Depression.
 Before Mr. Paterson and the legislative leaders could hammer out the final details, the Senate's Republican leader, Dean Skelos, announced with great fanfare and unbelievable cynicism that he was prepared, then and there, to call for a vote on the governor's draft plan. In raw, unmediated form, that plan was sure to lose. The governor had no choice but to cancel the proceedings and send everyone home. 
 The Republicans' strategy is obviously to defer all the tough choices until next year when the Democrats will be running the whole show: the governor's office, the Assembly and, at long last, the Senate. But while tactically shrewd in a narrow political sense, Mr. Skelos's approach is fiscally irresponsible. 
 It is inevitably and painfully true in this budget crisis that the longer you wait, the more you have to cut down the line. The economic problems surely will only deepen, and there's no chance, in the foreseeable future, of a miracle infusion of new money. For one-fifth of its revenues, New York depends on Wall Street, whose prospects seem to worsen by the day. 
 Prompt cuts along the lines recommended by Mr. Paterson would have plugged a $1.5 billion deficit in this year's budget. If that is rolled over, as now seems likely, the deficit for next year could exceed $12.5 billion. Closing that gap will be a task of epic proportions.
 Mr. Paterson is expected to announce his new budget for the next fiscal year in mid-December, a month ahead of schedule. At that point, the Legislature must turn its full attention to the issue. If the legislative leaders do not like the governor's ideas, they have a responsibility to offer alternatives -- not more political theater.

HEADLINE: Bill Clinton Said To Accept Terms Of Obama Team

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and HELENE COOPER; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Former President Bill Clinton has agreed to all of the conditions sought by President-elect Barack Obama's transition team to eliminate potential conflicts of interest if Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton becomes secretary of state, people close to the Clintons said Wednesday.
 Mr. Clinton accepted several restrictions on his business and philanthropic activities to remove any obstacle to his wife's nomination if the cabinet job is formally offered and accepted, said the associates, who insisted that they not be identified because they were disclosing confidential negotiations. ''I'll do whatever they want,'' Mr. Clinton said Wednesday at a public appearance. 
 The discussions came as Mr. Obama moved forward in putting together the team he will bring to office in January. Mr. Obama has decided to nominate Tom Daschle, the former Senate Democratic leader, as secretary of health and human services, Mr. Obama's advisers said Wednesday. Mr. Daschle has accepted the offer, which would make him a point man in Mr. Obama's ambitious plan to expand health care coverage. 
 Although Mr. Daschle's nomination will not be officially announced for a while, the transition team did make public several expected White House appointments on Wednesday. They included David Axelrod, who was Mr. Obama's chief campaign strategist and now will serve as senior adviser to the president, and Gregory B. Craig, who was Mr. Clinton's impeachment defense lawyer and now will serve as White House counsel.
 Two other leading contenders for cabinet positions emerged late Wednesday, Democrats with knowledge of the process said. Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona was poised to be offered the position of homeland security secretary, and Penny Pritzker, a Chicago businesswoman and national finance chairman of the Obama campaign, was in the final stages of vetting for commerce secretary.
 A longtime friend of Mr. Obama, Ms. Pritzker was a chief architect of his record-breaking fund-raising efforts during the presidential campaign. Ms. Priztker is one of three cousins who manage their dynasty's financial empire, which includes the Hyatt hotel chain, casinos and many other ventures. But some of Ms. Pritzker's business dealings may also raise tough questions during any confirmation process. She was involved in running and overseeing Superior Bank, an Illinois institution co-owned by her family that was at the forefront of turning subprime loans into securities, the risky practice at the heart of the financial crisis. The bank collapsed in 2001 after regulators discovered accounting irregularities that overstated its assets. 
 Washington continued to be gripped by the drama surrounding Mrs. Clinton's fate and the possibility that Mr. Obama might bring his toughest rival for the Democratic presidential nomination into his cabinet. Mr. Obama's advisers said the talks had gone well, but would not say if an agreement to avoid conflicts had been reached, as the Clinton camp has indicated. 
 Even if the guidelines for Mr. Clinton's future activities are on the verge of being resolved, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton must still decide if they can put the rancor of their long and bitter primary battle behind them. The two sides have a framework on ''what he needs to do to satisfy the vetting concerns and that gives her an opportunity to consider the job on the merits,'' said one person close to the Clintons.
 Both sides were engaged in a delicate public and private dance, maneuvering for position and reputation in case the deal falls through. Aides in each camp have grown increasingly sour toward the other in recent days as the matter played out publicly. 
 In their public signals, the Clintons are trying to take the former president's activities off the table as an issue, in their view eliminating any excuses for Mr. Obama not to give Mrs. Clinton the job. Some in the Obama camp are bristling at what they see as strategic leaks by the Clintons aimed at boxing in the president-elect and forcing him to offer the post. 
 The tension could foreshadow a complex relationship burdened by suspicion and enmity should Mrs. Clinton become secretary of state. By putting her in the cabinet, Mr. Obama could remove a potential thorn in the Senate on issues like health care and a potential rival for the nomination in 2012 if his term proves rocky. But he could also face a rival power center within his own administration with her on his team.
 In discussions over the last few days, Mr. Clinton has agreed to disclose some major donors to his charitable foundation and to subject his future foundation activities and paid speeches to review by the White House counsel's office and the State Department ethics office, according to Democrats close to the negotiations. He would step back from day-to-day responsibility involving the William J. Clinton Foundation and alert the State Department to speaking plans and new income sources.
 The Wall Street Journal first reported his concessions. Advisers to both Mr. Obama and the Clintons confirmed them on Wednesday. Clinton advisers added that the former president had met all of the conditions sought by the Obama team and said he would meet any others that might still be presented.
 ''I'm certain President Clinton will do whatever it takes, which means whatever President-elect Obama wants, to make the nomination acceptable, if he offers and she accepts,'' said Lanny J. Davis, a longtime Clinton friend who was special counsel in his White House and has consulted the Clinton camp in recent days.
 Asked about the situation at a ceremony in New York renaming the Triborough Bridge after Robert F. Kennedy on Wednesday, Mr. Clinton pledged the same without elaboration. ''Whatever they want,'' he said. He added that it was between the president-elect and his wife. ''You should talk to them. I'll do whatever they want.''
 Mr. Clinton is being represented in the talks by his longtime aides, Cheryl D. Mills, Bruce R. Lindsey and Douglas J. Band. Mr. Obama is being represented by John D. Podesta, his transition co-leader; Todd Stern, a deputy to Mr. Podesta, and Thomas J. Perrelli, a Harvard Law School classmate of Mr. Obama's. Reflecting the complex entanglements of the negotiations, all three of Mr. Obama's representatives served in Mr. Clinton's administration.
 In picking Mr. Daschle for health and human services, Mr. Obama is seeking to install a close ally and early supporter of his run for the presidency. Although no announcement will be made until after Mr. Obama first unveils his economic and national security teams, the transition office announced Wednesday that Mr. Daschle would also oversee a health policy working group to develop a health care plan.
 That could address what Mr. Daschle's friends said was a condition for considering the cabinet job, his insistence that he not just be the head of a huge bureaucracy but a chief player on the subject he has literally written a book on. 
 In ''Critical: What We Can Do About the Health-Care Crisis,'' published in February, Mr. Daschle proposed creating a Federal Health Board, similar to the Federal Reserve System, and merging employers' plans, Medicaid and Medicare with an expanded federal employee health benefits program to provide universal coverage.
 Mr. Daschle's former colleagues on Capitol Hill embraced his selection. ''President-elect Obama quite simply could not have made a better choice for the job,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon. Senator Charles E. Grassley, a senior Republican from Iowa, called it ''a big step forward'' because Mr. Daschle understands the Senate.
 While attention focused on Mr. Obama's emerging cabinet, the president-elect filled out more of his White House staff. Aside from Mr. Axelrod and Mr. Craig, the Obama transition announced that Lisa Brown, former counsel to Vice President Al Gore, will serve as staff secretary and Christopher P. Lu, a top aide in Mr. Obama's Senate office, will be cabinet secretary.

HEADLINE: Congratulation and a Concession for Alaska's Senator-Elect

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
Irascible will be out. Approachable will be in. That oil drilling and federal earmarks? They will still be a go.
 Alaska's senator-elect, Mayor Mark Begich of Anchorage, held a news conference in Anchorage on Wednesday, the morning after he unseated the longest-serving Republican in Senate history, Ted Stevens, and promised to be more of a listener and a consensus builder than he said Mr. Stevens had often been.
 ''What you have here is a state in transformation,'' said Mr. Begich, who will become Alaska's first Democratic senator since Mike Gravel left office in 1981. 
 ''What I want to do,'' he said, ''is repackage some of the messaging of what we have here that will have an impact on this country.''
 Mr. Begich said that would mean convincing Democrats in Congress that the nation's energy policy, not just Alaska, would benefit by drilling for oil in controversial areas like the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, as well as by developing a natural gas pipeline that would provide fuel for other states and by pursuing renewable and alternative fuels.
 But Mr. Begich said he wanted to broaden the story of Alaska beyond oil. He said he wanted to bring Democrats to Alaska to see impoverished rural areas, to see its distinctive challenges in areas like education and health care.
 ''I want to explain this differently,'' he said.
 Mr. Stevens, a 40-year incumbent known for delivering billions of dollars in federal money for Alaska and often throwing sharp elbows in the process, conceded the race shortly after Mr. Begich's news conference. After a prolonged count of absentee ballots, Mr. Stevens trailed Mr. Begich by more than 3,700 votes, out of 315,000 cast, with an estimated 2,500 votes still to be counted next week.
 ''Given the number of ballots that remain to be counted, it is apparent the election has been decided and Mayor Begich has been elected,'' Mr. Stevens, who was in Washington, said in a statement. ''My family and I wish to thank the thousands of Alaskans who stood by us and who supported my re-election.''
 Eight days before the election, Mr. Stevens, 85, was convicted in federal court in Washington of seven felony counts of failing to disclose gifts and free home renovations he had received. He returned to Alaska six days before the election to campaign, running advertisements that said he had been wrongly convicted and would be vindicated on appeal.
 ''I am proud of the campaign we ran and regret that the outcome was not what we had hoped for,'' Mr. Stevens said. Mr. Begich said he had received a congratulatory call Wednesday morning from Lisa Murkowski, Alaska's junior senator and a Republican who supported Mr. Stevens. He said Gov. Sarah Palin, also a Republican, had congratulated him at an event both attended. 
 In a statement released later, Ms. Palin said: ''This is a new era for Alaska, and I look forward to working with Mark on the many issues that are important to our state. I am confident he will add a compelling new voice to the U.S. Senate.'' 
 On the thorny subject of federal earmark spending, though, Mr. Begich sounded a familiar tone Wednesday. He said he still expected the state to pursue and receive the federal money. 
 His approach would echo what he said was current thinking in Congress: pursue projects that are consistent with long-term planning for transportation and other infrastructure, to create jobs and economic growth. 
 ''A holistic approach,'' Mr. Begich called it. One specific project he mentioned was federal financing for Alaska's ferry system.

HEADLINE: In a Roomful of Representatives, Perhaps a Senator in Waiting

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A few minutes after Representative Charles B. Rangel called a meeting of New York's Congressional delegation to order on Wednesday in his trademark fashion -- putting two fingers to his lips to make a screeching whistle -- he could not help joking about the elephants in the room.
 As he introduced Charles E. Schumer, the state's senior senator, Mr. Rangel remarked that he was pleased to be in a room ''full of potential junior senators from New York,'' according to one participant who spoke anonymously because the meeting was closed to the press. 
 The room rumbled with laughter.
 Although the meeting's purpose was to discuss the state's approach for winning financial assistance from the federal government -- the delegation decided it would fare better after Barack Obama takes office in January -- the subtext was glaring. For the first time since Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's name was mentioned as a possible choice to be Mr. Obama's secretary of state, several of the people who could replace her in the Senate -- and the man who will choose that person -- were in the same room together. Mrs. Clinton, however, was not there.
 Gov. David A. Paterson, who according to the United States Constitution would select a Senate replacement, said nothing to the delegation about the speculation, which has consumed Washington and Albany in the last week.
 On his way out of the Capitol, Mr. Paterson said he had not given much thought to replacing Mrs. Clinton. ''I don't think I have to start thinking until they do something,'' he said. ''Meanwhile, I can use all that energy to try to save the state.''
 People who are familiar with Mr. Paterson's thinking on the matter have said in recent days that while the governor had not made a short list, he has discussed several names -- including Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo, Representative Kirsten E. Gillibrand of Hudson, Representative Brian Higgins of Buffalo and the Bronx borough president, Adolfo Carrion Jr.
 Mr. Paterson would prefer to have a candidate who is from upstate or is a woman or is Latino, according to people who know the governor's preferences but requested anonymity so they could speak openly about his thinking. And if he could find a candidate who satisfies more than one of those categories, all the better, those people said. If he cannot find a suitable candidate who meets those criteria, they said, he would prefer someone with high statewide name recognition who could withstand a challenge from Republicans in the next election.
 No one from the delegation on Wednesday seemed to want to discuss the possibility that Mrs. Clinton's seat could come open.
 ''Ugh. I don't even want to comment on that,'' said Representative Jerrold Nadler.
 Representative Carolyn Maloney insisted that she and her colleagues were not focused on the issue. ''Nothing was said about that,'' she said. ''We were focused on the economy.''
 As Ms. Gillibrand was rushing out of the Capitol, she brushed off a question about whether she would accept the job if offered. ''I think that's highly premature,'' she said. 
 Mr. Higgins said he would not comment about being on what he called ''the periphery of speculation.''
 Instead, members of New York's delegation were on message about the economy. In a press conference after their meeting, Mr. Rangel, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Paterson and Sheldon Silver, the speaker of the State Assembly, said the delegation had decided to wait until January to start seriously pressing their case for federal assistance. 
 Mr. Paterson, in particular, has been very vocal in the last few months about New York's need for federal aid. Wednesday's visit was his second trip to Washington in two weeks. But delegation members said they decided their energy would be better spent after the new president took office and more Democrats were seated in Congress. President Bush and Republicans on Capitol Hill have resisted an aid package for the states.
 ''Unfortunately we're dealing with the remnants of those that lost the elections,'' Mr. Rangel said. ''We have no choice except to go home.''
 Mr. Paterson said he would like Congress to act now but that he understood the political reality. ''We don't really think we should wait until January to take action, but it appears that's the way it's going to be in Washington. And unless I hear otherwise, that's the way it's going to be in Albany.''
 Mr. Paterson was referring to the collapse on Tuesday of his effort to close New York's $1.5 billion budget deficit after Senate Republicans blocked it.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 3, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Nov. 20, about a meeting of New York's Congressional delegation that brought together several people mentioned as possible successors to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton if she joined President-elect Barack Obama's cabinet, referred imprecisely to the role of the United States Constitution in filling a Senate vacancy. The Constitution allows state legislatures to empower governors to select a replacement until voters select a successor themselves; it does not itself grant governors the authority to name a replacement. 
 The article also misspelled, in some copies, the given name of the Bronx borough president, whose name was said to be in discussion. He is Adolfo Carrion Jr., not Adolpho.

HEADLINE: Eli Broad Plans Another Art Space

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Eli Broad, the philanthropist whose gift financed a new contemporary-art building this year at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, is planning to build another exhibition space for his vast collection, even as a third museum devoted to contemporary art here is facing a financial squeeze.
 Mr. Broad, who early this year said he was not interested in building his own museum to display his collection, is now mulling the construction of new offices for his art foundation and ''a first-class public art museum,'' according to a letter sent last month to the City of Beverly Hills by a lawyer representing him. 
 The move comes as the Museum of Contemporary Art, a separate, privately financed institution in downtown Los Angeles, is facing a budget crisis that has led it to shut down part of its facilities for six months and to step up an effort to find new financing. In a statement Wednesday the museum said its board was ''currently evaluating several scenarios that could lead to securing long-term viability for the museum and plans to reach a solution within the next 90 days.''
 The confluence of events once again raises a question that came to the fore as far back as 2003, when Mr. Broad first announced his vast gift to the county museum for construction of the $56 million Broad Contemporary: How many institutions devoted to contemporary art might the Los Angeles area need?
 The answer is not an easy one for a city that is relentlessly devoted to seeking out the next new thing. The contemporary art market has boomed in recent years, and local museums like the Hammer, the Getty and the Huntington Library, in addition to the county museum and the Museum of Contemporary Art, have expanded their contemporary programming at the same time. 
 Yet leaders of many cultural institutions, including those museums, have continued to complain intensely yet privately about the failure of Hollywood moguls to support the arts adequately.
 That clouded picture has become even less clear since the recent downturn in the financial markets, which presented major troubles for the financial companies that are among the biggest corporate sponsors of arts institutions. 
 ''I wish people were throwing money at the museum,'' Michael Govan, the director of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, said in an interview on Wednesday. ''But that's not happening.''
 While his museum has seen a dip in membership revenue this year, potential donors have continued to follow through on their pledges, Mr. Govan said. The situation is less clear at the Museum of Contemporary Art, which this month announced that it would make immediate moves to cut its spending by 10 percent, including closing its Geffen Contemporary annex for six months beginning in January.
 The Los Angeles Times reported on Wednesday that the museum ''is seeking large cash infusions from donors'' after several years of declining financial reserves. The museum issued a statement on Wednesday saying it has made a 10 percent cut in its budget for this year and is talking with several potential partners to resolve its financial difficulties. 
 Even the wealthiest of local institutions have felt the pinch of the economic downturn. The J. Paul Getty Museum recently undertook a plan to reduce its staff, has cut back on visiting hours and has increased what it charges visitors to park. 
 Yet the full effect of the financial downturn is not yet clear. A Getty spokeswoman said that the Getty Trust's endowment had an investment return of negative-2 percent in the year that ended June 30. But the slide in world financial markets has accelerated since then. 
 The Museum of Contemporary Art has not yet released its financial statements for the year that ended June 30. In the fiscal year that ended in June 2007, its invested endowment measured $19.8 million, down from $38.7 million in 2000.
 Mr. Broad also has said his assets have lost significant value in the recent downturn. This month he told The Los Angeles Times that the total value of all his foundations had fallen by 18 percent in the recent market declines.
 Joanne Heyler, the curator of the Broad Art Foundation, said in an interview that the foundation had for some time been considering building or buying a new site to house its holdings because its current space, in Santa Monica, is too cramped. That building includes display space for some artworks but is not open to the public.
 A new building would not be open for two to three years, and multiple sites are under consideration, she said. The site mentioned in the recent lawyer's letter is on a strip of land at the intersection of Santa Monica and Wilshire Boulevards in Beverly Hills that now includes retail stores and an old railroad right-of-way.
 Mr. Broad has hired the Gensler architecture, planning and consulting firm to represent him in planning the new project, which if built on such a prominent corner in Beverly Hills would almost certainly involve the work of a marquee architect. Mr. Broad chose Renzo Piano to design the Broad Contemporary Art Museum. His own residence was built by using unfinished plans by Frank Gehry after the architect and Mr. Broad disagreed on the project's timeline.
 The decision to build his own public art museum is a reversal for Mr. Broad, who previously said he had no interest in a private museum because he wanted to help museums around the world by loaning his works. 
 That reversal follows a more surprising shift earlier this year. In January, on the eve of the opening of the Broad Contemporary, Mr. Broad announced that he had changed his mind and would not donate his vast collection to one or several museums, as he had previously said he would.
 Instead, he said, he intended to keep his holdings in his art foundation and to lend the works out to institutions to ensure that they spent as little time in storage as possible. The shift was widely viewed as a blow to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which was viewed as first in line to receive much of the collection, given Mr. Broad's links to the museum. 
 Now, Mr. Govan said, he does not view the new Broad exhibition space as a threat. ''This is not in competition with what we are doing,'' he said. ''I hope he is successful, because it is important for the city of Los Angeles.''

HEADLINE: Sarkozy's Fiscal Meeting Raises Diplomatic Hackles

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Katrin Bennhold contributed reporting from Paris.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President Nicolas Sarkozy of France left the summit meeting on the financial crisis here last weekend in a triumphal mood, declaring that it had tamed the animal spirits of American capitalism. Then he went home and announced that he would hold his own summit meeting in a few weeks in Paris -- on the same topic.
 That has raised hackles in diplomatic circles, not just because the meeting appears to compete with a planned gathering of 20 world leaders next April. Mr. Sarkozy's aggressive statements have put American officials on edge, with some saying that he seemed determined to turn the global crisis into a referendum on the ills of untrammeled capitalism. 
 ''Sarkozy claimed he put a bell on the American cat,'' said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. ''He said the U.S. had agreed to a whole range of negotiations on regulations. But he didn't actually come in and negotiate any of these things.''
 Making matters worse, Mr. Sarkozy said nothing about his plans to convene a meeting to President Bush or the 18 other leaders while he was here. A senior European diplomat said he found the French proposal ''amazing,'' while an American official said that that would be a charitable description.
 French officials said the gathering on Jan. 8 and 9, which is to be co-hosted by former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, is merely a conference, intended to bring together political leaders and prominent thinkers to discuss issues like globalization and the values of capitalism.
 The surfeit of summit meetings reflects what has become a tense trans-Atlantic contest over the global economy. Much of this is posturing by ambitious leaders, but it also reflects a genuine philosophical debate about how best to fix the fractured global markets.
 On one side is Mr. Sarkozy, the supercharged French leader, determined to keep the initiative on what many in Europe regard as a long-overdue discussion of the excesses of American-style capitalism.
 On the other is Mr. Bush, playing out his final weeks in office but unwilling to allow Europeans, especially the French, to dominate the debate on how to overhaul international financial regulations.
 Certainly, the two leaders had sharply different interpretations of what happened at the meeting. Mr. Sarkozy portrayed it as a shift in power, saying, ''Europe for the first time expressed its clear determination.'' Americans had ''never, ever'' been willing to negotiate these kinds of regulatory changes, he said.
 Mr. Bush agreed that the meeting had been productive. But he noted that the leaders had reaffirmed the value of free markets, free trade and the primacy of national regulation -- all hallmarks of American capitalism. 
 The timing of Mr. Sarkozy's January meeting has ruffled feathers, even more than its agenda has, because the Group of 20 set out a detailed process to tackle regulatory reform. It assigned working groups to develop proposals on 47 issues, to be taken up later by the leaders, possibly in London.
 At that meeting, President-elect Barack Obama will have a seat at the table. Mr. Obama will not, however, be in office during the Paris meeting, ensuring that the participants discuss the future of capitalism when the world's leading practitioner of it is still in a transition.
 Though the Elysee Palace, Mr. Sarkozy's office, announced the meeting as an international summit, his aides emphasized that it was an informal gathering not connected to the G-20.
 Among those planning to attend are two Nobel Prize-winning economists, Joseph E. Stiglitz and Amartya Sen. Mr. Blair is contacting world leaders, aides said, adding that it was too soon to say which ones would attend.
 ''It's a joint idea of Tony Blair and Nicolas Sarkozy; they have had it on their minds for a while,'' said a French official, who, like other officials, spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.
 Mr. Sarkozy has had many ideas. He proposed last weekend's meeting, though Mr. Bush rejected his idea to hold the talks in New York. American officials said it was Mr. Bush's idea to expand the guest list to 20 countries, rather than the usual gathering of 7 or 8. 
 The common ground between Europe and the United States is greater than these public statements suggest. The United States has shown a willingness to accept regulation of a wide variety of institutions and markets, including credit default swaps -- a form of bond insurance -- and possibly private equity firms and hedge funds, that are not now regulated.
 ''People may have been surprised by the U.S. willingness to cooperate on issues,'' said David H. McCormick, under secretary of the Treasury for international affairs.
 Although the French favor a strong state role in the economy and are partial to regulatory agencies with cross-border authority, they did not propose such measures at the talks here. That was mainly because Britain and Germany had earlier resisted a supranational regulator.

HEADLINE: Obama, Misha And the Bear

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
Gail Collins is off today.

DATELINE: TBILISI, Georgia 

 BODY:
 A wounded, angry bear is loose north of here, and it has people terrified.
 The bear has ravaged this lovely country, a booming capitalist enclave that worships America, relies on a much-praised flat tax and has uprooted corruption almost overnight (in part by firing every traffic cop in the country).
 A main road here is named for President George W. Bush, who visited in 2005. Everybody studies English, sometimes in the local McDonald's franchises, and people seem bewildered at Western doubts about their behavior toward the Russians. 
 ''We thought we had escaped them, and they came back and raped us,'' said Alexander Rondeli, who runs a think tank in Tbilisi. ''And people in the West are saying we have to tell them to be our guest.''
 The architect of today's Georgia is Mikheil Saakashvili. Misha, as he is universally known, is young, brilliant, charismatic, American-educated and staffs his government with people like him. You get the sense that any given Georgian cabinet official is about half the age and double the I.Q. of his or her American equivalent.
 Now with Georgians mauled by the bear in the brief August war, they desperately want to join NATO for protection, and one of the few things that Barack Obama and John McCain agreed on in the campaign was to oblige by continuing the process of admitting Georgia into NATO. 
 In fact, that's an awful idea. President-elect Obama needs a new approach to Russia if we want to avoid a new cold war, and we also need to get over our crush on Misha.
 Look carefully and you see that Georgia isn't quite the shining beacon of democracy that Americans sometimes believe.
 ''Journalists are basically forbidden from telling real stories,'' said Sopho Mosidze, a television journalist. ''If you watch Russian TV or Georgian TV, it's the same. It's government propaganda.''
 Ms. Mosidze is bitter partly because the station she was working at a year ago was stormed by special forces carrying guns while she was anchoring a news show. She said that troops cut off the signal and then beat up some of the journalists. The channel soon was reborn as a pro-government station. Indeed, today all nationally broadcast TV stations are in effect controlled by the government.
 Then there is the Georgian War of August. It's still not clear exactly how the war started, but what is certain is that Misha's narrative -- an unprovoked Russian invasion that forced Georgian troops to try to defend their territory -- is nonsense.
 The most likely explanation is that Misha, tired of continuous Russian provocations and emboldened by American support, saw a chance to recover territories that Russians were nibbling on. That was spectacularly reckless, and as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have documented, the Georgian Army (along with Russia's) fired cluster bombs that harmed civilians.
 ''It was possible to avoid this war,'' said Nino Burjanadze, a former close ally of Misha who last month formed an opposition party to challenge him. ''Because of miscalculation, my country was involved in a war it was clear that it would lose.''
 Russia took advantage of the war on the territory of one of Georgia's breakaway republics to invade Georgia proper, and, if it hadn't been for forceful American and European protests, Russian troops might well have overrun Tbilisi.
 Since then, the United States has announced a $1 billion package of aid for Georgia. We should remember that military assistance would be a waste, for Georgia's Army will never be strong enough to deter Russia. In contrast, trade and investment give Georgia international economic weight and probably help discourage a Russian invasion.
 Note to Mr. Obama: It would be a nightmare to have our troops tethered through NATO to Misha. In any case, Georgia doesn't obviously qualify for NATO membership since it doesn't control its full territory, while the talk about NATO pushes all the wrong Russian nationalist buttons. 
 ''NATO is not Georgia's future,'' said Amy Denman, executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Georgia. ''Georgia's future is economic growth. If they can continue the economic growth cycle they're on, they're safe.''
 Because Russia behaves irresponsibly -- including its latest disgraceful threat to base missiles near Poland -- the temptation in the Obama administration will be to continue with NATO expansion and perhaps even with the ill-advised missile system for Europe. (We have so many better ways to spend money!) Instead, let's engage Russia as we engage China -- while still bluntly calling Russia on its uncivilized behavior. 
 Poking badly behaved bears is no substitute for sober diplomacy. We don't want Barack to be another Misha.

HEADLINE: Defiant Mayor Won't Promise To Send Rebate

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
One city lawmaker called it Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's ''Let them eat cake'' attitude.
 After being dealt a rare public embarrassment by the City Council, which forced his administration to acknowledge on Monday that he was legally required to send out $400 rebate checks promised to hundreds of thousands of New York homeowners, a defiant Mr. Bloomberg said on Wednesday that he had no plans to release the money.
 At a news conference, Mr. Bloomberg described the rebates as ''up in the air.'' Asked what he would tell homeowners who have been depending on the money to pay bills or buy holiday gifts, he responded: ''Plan for the worst, and hope for the best.'' 
 When pressed, the mayor said: ''I just answered your question. You just don't want the answer.''
 The mayor has argued that the city cannot afford the rebates this year. Still, Mr. Bloomberg's remarks left people in the political world scratching their heads, with some accusing him of profound insensitivity to those who lack fat bank accounts, especially as job losses and foreclosures mount in the city. 
 ''It's the height of arrogance and insensitivity,'' said Councilman Lewis A. Fidler of Brooklyn, who also said that Mr. Bloomberg had a ''Let them eat cake'' attitude toward the homeowners. 
 ''They look at what does this mean to someone on the Upper East Side or Central Park West and say, $400, so what?'' Mr. Fidler said. ''I'm looking at it from what it means to Mrs. Goldstein, a 72-year-old senior in my district who lives on Social Security and is counting on that money,'' he added, using a hypothetical example.
 The rebate checks, sent to about 600,000 individual owners of condos, co-ops or houses in the city over the last several years, are typically mailed out in October, and this year, with more residents feeling especially pinched, City Hall has been bombarded with calls from people looking for their checks.
 Mr. Bloomberg declared on Nov. 5 that he was effectively canceling the program for this fiscal year, which ends on June 30, and that there would be no rebates distributed, because of the city's worsening fiscal situation. His aides instructed the city's 311 operators to tell callers that no checks would be forthcoming. 
 On Monday, the administration admitted that despite Mr. Bloomberg's announcement that he would withhold the checks, he could not legally do so without City Council approval, because the rebates were included in the budget passed by the Council and signed by the mayor. Council leaders, who had signaled they would not go along with the plan to hold back the money, expected the checks to be released within a few weeks as a result.
 The mayor's comments recall previous remarks that have left him seeming out of touch with those he governs. 
 When residents complained that the city was issuing parking tickets after a snowstorm in 2007, the mayor -- who typically takes the subway or a chauffeured sport utility vehicle to work -- suggested that New Yorkers stop ''griping.'' About crowded subways, he has said: ''So you stand next to people. Get real. This is New York.'' 
 This year, responding to complaints that black rubber mats and other playground equipment get dangerously hot in the summer, the mayor said: ''If it's hot, don't sit on it. Air-conditioning the slide is not something we can afford to do.''
 On Wednesday, when saying that the city was trying to turn the thermostats down inside city buildings to save heating costs, he offered this advice: ''Wear a sweater if you're chilly.''
 But it also appears that Mr. Bloomberg is irritated by a newly aggressive City Council, which was deeply divided over his move last month to push through legislation allowing him to seek a third term.
 One person close to the mayor, who insisted on anonymity to avoid revealing private conversations with Mr. Bloomberg, said the mayor was especially irked that four Council members went to court on Tuesday to try to compel the administration to issue the rebates immediately. 
 Richard D. Emery, a civil rights and election lawyer, said he was dumbfounded by the mayor's stalling in sending out checks he has no legal authority to cancel.
 ''The pattern of Bloomberg arrogance is reaching frightening proportions,'' he said. ''The impetuousness is kind of scary.''
 Still, the mayor's bluntness has always been part of his appeal, making him appear a less scripted and typical politician, and his aides have suggested that his popularity stems in part from his making unpopular decisions.
 Indeed, hours after Mr. Bloomberg's remarks on Monday, two administration officials, while allowing that legally they must send out the checks, said they believed they could hold on to the money until the end of this fiscal year in June, which would give the city a cushion until then. 
 Some Council members wonder whether Mr. Bloomberg is trying to use the rebates as a bargaining chip to force the Council to go along with other cuts or tax increases. 
 Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, rejected any suggestion that the mayor was insensitive to residents' desire to receive the rebates, noting that the mayor himself initiated the rebate program in his first term. 
 ''Nobody wants to send money more than he does,'' Mr. Loeser said. ''The question is, how are we going to pay for them, when we already proposed eliminating a Police Academy class, and reducing hours overnight at certain firehouses?''
 The proposal to halt the checks was part of a broad package that Mr. Bloomberg unveiled on Nov. 5, in which he argued that the global economic crisis would leave the city with a $4 billion deficit over the next two years. 
 Mr. Bloomberg proposed raising property taxes by 7 percent in January, six months earlier than planned. He spelled out $1.5 billion in budget cuts. And he warned that the city might need to raise its personal income tax as much as 15 percent and impose a sales tax on clothing.
 So on Wednesday, at the news conference, which was called to announce tougher inspections for home heating oil delivery trucks, Mr. Bloomberg talked about the rebates within the context of the city's overall budget squeeze. 
 ''We have no money,'' he said.

LENGTH: 364 words

HEADLINE: A Case Study in Updating Retro the Right Way

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
Introduced on Tuesday: 2010 Ford Mustang.
 Is it real? Yes, but perhaps ill-timed. The same day Alan Mulally, chief executive of Ford Motor, was in Washington begging Congress for bailout money to keep Detroit automakers afloat, the company was unveiling its hot new Mustang at an elaborate private party on the eve of the Los Angeles auto show. 
 What they said: ''Muscle goes modern for 2010 as the Ford Mustang -- America's favorite muscle car for 45 years straight -- hits the streets with a new exterior design; new world-class interior featuring well-crafted materials and updated technology; and a V-8 with even more horsepower and an even throatier signature Mustang exhaust sound,'' Ford's press kit read.
 What they didn't say: A faster, louder Mustang may not be exactly the most politically correct new product to introduce, considering the auto industry's troubles, but it is nevertheless one of Ford's two core products (along with the new, more-of-everything F-150 pickup, also due out soon). Redesigning the Mustang now also brings it current with the Dodge Challenger and the at-last-to-be-introduced Chevrolet Camaro.
 What makes it tick? For the GT, a thirsty 315-horsepower 4.6-liter V-8 that was previously the uprated engine in the souped-up Bullitt special edition. For maximum power and torque, this V-8 slurps premium unleaded at the rate of a gallon every 16 miles in city driving (23 m.p.g. highway). A thriftier alternative is the base Mustang V-6, with 210 horsepower and 17/23 economy on regular unleaded. 
 How much, how soon? As sales of the popular current model, essentially unchanged since its 2005 introduction, wind down expect the new Mustang to make its appearance in early spring 2009. Prices will hew pretty close to the current range of $20,000-$30,000 for the coupes. A convertible versionh should cost $4,000-$5,000 more.
 How's it look? The 2010 Mustang is sleeker, stronger and more expressive; it graduates cum laude from the school of ''Don't Mess Up a Legend'' design. With its meaner nose and cool lighting, I think people will have little trouble recognizing it's new, although they might need to park them side by side to really tell.

HEADLINE: A Son of Detroit Takes On Detroit

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Let Detroit Go Bankrupt,'' by Mitt Romney (Op-Ed, Nov. 19):
 In Michigan today, unemployment reached a 16-year high as a direct result of the nation's economic downturn. Mr. Romney's suggestion that our economy would be best served by a Big Three bankruptcy is a breathtaking assertion of economic Darwinism made more shocking by his roots in Michigan, where hundreds of thousands of jobs rely on the auto industry. 
 The Center for Automotive Research reports that if one of the Big Three ceased operations in 2009, nearly 2.5 million jobs would be lost in the first year. Additionally, one year of bankruptcy would result in the loss of $125 billion in personal income, $17 billion in Social Security receipts and $20 billion in personal income taxes. 
 Nonetheless, bankruptcy advocates like Mr. Romney would pile these kinds of losses onto the shoulders of a nation already struggling under the weight of record mortgage foreclosures, a recessionary slowdown across economic sectors, a credit crunch and decreasing global demand for American products. 
 There are no human benefits to Mr. Romney's you're-on-your-own approach, only continued loss of jobs, homes and health care for millions of people. 
 A bankruptcy in the auto industry will cripple our economy and worsen the human toll of our current economic challenges. 
 Now is not the time for Mr. Romney or his supporters in Congress to advocate for experiments with intriguing financial techniques on some grand scale. It is time to work cooperatively on a solution that invests in security for American workers and in our technological strength. 
 John D. Cherry Jr. Lieutenant Governor Lansing, Mich., Nov. 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 As a Massachusetts Democrat who is ecstatic about the election of Barack Obama, I never expected to side with Mr. Romney and disagree strongly with President-elect Obama's first major policy push. 
 Our country's economic health is not going to thrive in the long term by supporting an anemic and poorly managed automobile industry. What the American auto industry needs instead is an overhaul to become lean, competitive, smart and mostly a contributor to rather than a detractor from an energy-smart future. 
 A bailout will provide no incentive to do just that and will ultimately cripple the industry by encouraging it to head down the same wrong path it has been on for far too long. 
 Mr. Obama campaigned on a platform of change; let us hope that future policy directions of the new administration will work toward real positive change for the American automobile industry.
 Jennifer Hyde Newton, Mass., Nov. 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Mitt Romney doesn't mention one important reason American automakers cannot compete with foreign ones. BMW, Honda, Nissan and Toyota are all in countries that have universal health care. 
 As long as General Motors, Ford and Chrysler have to pay for the medical care of their workers and retirees, they will never be on a level playing field. Perhaps the best way for the government to bail out Detroit is to enact a universal health care system.
 Betsy Britton Setauket, N.Y., Nov. 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Mitt Romney's solution to the automakers' financial collapse is a complicated explanation of a simple concept: Blame labor.
 For the last few years, the risks were clear to auto executives and board members. Labor costs, mostly health and retirement costs for an aging work force, necessitated high profit margins on their products. The only options available for high profits were large vehicles, S.U.V.'s and trucks. 
 The automakers chose not to push Congress or the Bush administration on universal health care, which would have brought their companies back to global competitiveness, out of ideological sympathy with Republican values.
 Yet Mr. Romney expects the autoworkers to just accept his verdict and take the hit.
 Short-minded concern for the corporate bottom line and reluctance to think past ideology doomed his friends in Big Three boardrooms.
 Would he have made different decisions five years ago given the same choices? He gives no indication otherwise.
 Shame on you, Mr. Romney, for continuing to ignore the implications of the burden of health care on all of American industry. You fault the auto executives for the wrong reasons to protect a failed ideology.
 Michael Meade Mahopac, N.Y., Nov. 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Mitt Romney's Op-Ed article makes a good deal of sense and reinforces his great business acumen. I would add one other suggestion that I believe would help car sales. 
 Give consumers a tax credit for every American car that they buy. The domestic car market has been completely overrun by the foreign markets, and we need to give buyers an incentive to come back home and help bolster our own economy.
 Carole Gabay Boca Raton, Fla., Nov. 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Mitt Romney seems to me to want to handle the car industry crisis by holding back money for the Big Three while busting the unions, cutting worker pensions and laying off workers. He places minimal blame on the chief executives, with no mention of their unwillingness all these years to stop producing the gas-guzzling S.U.V. while foreign car manufacturers wisely focused on America's need to drive smaller vehicles. 
 Instead, Mr. Romney's sledgehammer approach would make cars $2,000 cheaper per vehicle if we cut worker pensions, but he never mentions how we could lower the costs in Detroit $1,500 per vehicle by removing the burden of employee medical benefits from car manufacturers with the introduction of national health care, and no one would get hurt.
 This mess, like our current financial crisis, started from the top, not the bottom. If Mr. Romney would inflict further hardships on an already overburdened working class, who will be buying the cars?
 Vincent Pepe Bellerose, Queens, Nov. 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Missing from both Detroit's pleas for a bailout and the national discussion of its pros and cons is any acknowledgment that the American taxpayer continuously subsidizes the automobile industry through the financing of local, state and federal roads. 
 If car companies were suddenly forced to acquire the land and maintain the infrastructure that its products need to function, the real cost of a car would be beyond the reach of all but the wealthiest people, and our national economy would come to a standstill until another form of transportation were subsidized and developed to take its place.
 Whether General Motors is ''too big to fail'' and therefore deserves a bailout ignores the fact that the company, along with every other carmaker in the world, is subsidized by our tax dollars. Giving the automakers more for abusing their unique standing hardly seems appropriate.

HEADLINE: Cost Cutting, a k a Mooching

BYLINE: By MICHELLE SLATALLA. 
E-mail: Slatalla@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IT was a very good party, with twinkling white lights, a silver punch bowl and Arianna Huffington making an appearance to soar above the other guests like a celebrity-seeking drone. I'm sure that in a better economy I would have enjoyed it.
 But unlike the hipper members of the Los Angeles media crowd who elbowed toward my friend Nick's 50th birthday cake the other night, I had a nerve-racking assignment: to shadow Neil and Joan.
 ''Be alert,'' my husband warned as we met briefly in the taco line to compare notes. ''It's after 8 -- late for him -- and he might bolt.''
 ''I'm on it,'' I said, gliding off before anybody could make a break for the door. My husband, meanwhile, sidled over to work Joel and Lisa. Tough times call for a backup plan. 
 These are all people my husband and I used to think of as our best friends. But that was before we spent a long, trying weekend bumming rides from them -- an important component of our new all-cash diet -- because our stringent budget wouldn't cover a rental subcompact during our recent visit to Los Angeles. Now that we were parasites, we couldn't afford to let ''Host 1'' and ''Host 2'' out of our sight.
 Not that saving $139.99 on a Chevy Aero can solve all my money problems. The economy is in turmoil and mine is in freefall. Our retirement accounts are down 40 percent, one daughter is in college and a second is headed there, and my husband and I work in the media business, a career choice that makes ''stockbroker'' sound like a dependable job.
 Since the bigger issues are things I can't change, I resolved to take charge of what I can control: daily spending. 
 Step 1 was to understand why our credit card debt was ballooning. A few weeks ago, I convened a frank meeting of the household finance committee (my husband) and subcommittees (daughters) to try to get a hold on the crisis.
 ''We can still buy gas, right?'' asked the high school senior.
 ''Yes, provided that you take your sister to ballet on Tuesdays and Thursdays,'' I said.
 ''What about my Habbo membership?'' asked the 11-year-old, who presents in various virtual worlds as a 38-year-old French mother of two who recently moved to the United States.
 ''Mais oui,'' I said, ''as long as it comes out of your allocation.''
 I scrutinized the Visa bill. ''Did we really need to buy this fancy bar of lavender soap?'' I asked my husband.
 ''Irish Spring makes me smell like a tart,'' my husband said defensively. He continued to lobby for funds to start his dream business -- a karaoke bar in the basement -- to raise extra cash to support his penchant for expensive personal hygiene products.
 ''Who would come?'' I asked.
 ''The neighbors,'' he said. ''I happen to know that Dorfman would pay a lot to have someone listen to him sing 'Don't Stop Believing.' '' 
 I tabled the discussion. Instead, we decided that the only way to get a handle on our expenses was to swear off credit cards. The all-cash diet meant pay as you go, for every single thing except, of course, the dress I secretly planned to buy for the Los Angeles party. We allotted a daily budget of $100 -- we wanted to ease into this, after all -- to cover food, clothing, gas, gym, dry cleaning, entertainment, our daughters' weekly allowances and the footlong rawhide bones to which our dog, Otto, was contractually entitled.
 Of course, I knew it wouldn't be easy. We'd have to turn ultracheap for starters, and gradually cut back on how much we charged. The trick would be to pull together -- except for the dress -- and establish our own personal cheapness factor as a couple. At first, things went O.K. We stumbled a bit at the beginning, when the ATM machine spit $700 in crisp twenties into our sweaty palms and, hypnotized by the smell of money, we rushed to a restaurant to spend $21. We took the leftovers home, at least, and came out $217 ahead for the week.
 It turned out we'd need the windfall. The second week, a number of irregularly recurring expenses decided to recur. I wrote a check for $170 to my daughter's Hebrew tutor and a $60 prescription drug refill arrived in the mail. Our car endured a bird attack of Hitchcockian proportions, sending us to the car wash for a $20 body scrub.
 All that happened well before our trip. We checked in for a two-night nonrefundable stay that had been booked months before at what I now think of as a superfancy Los Angeles hotel -- where my husband was unable to repulse the uniformed doorman who wrenched his bag out of his hands upon arrival. Fifty cents, down the drain. 
 We figured we'd make it all back, and then some, with our plot to mooch rides. At first, our friends even thought the whole idea was amusing. After all, they had once been journalists too, before abandoning the struggling news business for lines of work even more lucrative than karaoke. They grudgingly admired the way we had gone to great pains to figure out where they were staying before we chose an alternative equidistant to their five-star hotels.
 ''Think of the carbon footprints we'll be saving,'' my husband said, meaningfully. ''Together.''
 He had worked up a little calendar of rides, which he wanted to pass around. ''Who's up for taking us home from the restaurant tonight?'' he asked jovially. I, being more sensitive to the nuances of social niceties, began to sense a little reluctance and stopped him before he could ask for a Sunday morning drop-off at LAX. It was nearly an hour away, after all.
 Dinner was excellent, the more so since Neil insisted on paying; Joel picked up the wine bill. But by Saturday, our friends were bickering about who had to drive the ''schnorrers'' -- as they now referred to us (meanly, I thought) -- to tennis and the birthday party.
 I guess, if I had to pick a moment when my ''friends'' really turned against us, it was when Joan suggested that we go out for lunch. ''Should I bring my wallet?'' I asked politely. You could have air-conditioned a 45-foot Winnebago in the chill.
 Joel drew the short stick after the birthday party and dropped us at the hotel. Actually, he parked about 50 feet beyond the entrance to avoid a line of available cabs -- which he pointedly called to our attention -- and then warned that he might park even farther away the next morning when he picked us up to go to breakfast.
 ''How far?'' my husband asked suspiciously. ''More than a half-mile?''
 ''Over there,'' Joel said, pointing to an intersection.
 ''Not a problem for us,'' my husband said briskly. Then we hopped out of the car and ran serpentine to avoid the bellhops holding the door.

HEADLINE: Hudson River Park Board Weighs Proposals for 15th Street Pier Development

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Three developers are vying for the right to transform a dilapidated 880-foot pier at the end of 15th Street in Chelsea into a three-level complex of museums, shops, film centers, food markets and public space intended to attract tourists and local residents.
 The proposals by the developers -- Related Companies, Youngwoo & Associates and the Durst Organization -- will be unveiled on Thursday in the second attempt in five years to create a commercial operation that would generate revenue to maintain Hudson River Park, the five miles of waterfront running from the Battery to 59th Street. 
 A developer selected in 2005 to create a museum, cultural center and banquet hall withdrew this year, after costs soared and the principals became embroiled in scandal. The Hudson River Park Trust, which controls the park, has had to navigate among the competing concerns of developers with money-making proposals and residents who favor recreational and cultural activities and worry about traffic.
 Now the trust, and any developer it selects, must also contend with a sagging economy, tens of thousands of layoffs and a drop in tourism. Still, trust officials say they are excited by the latest batch of proposals.
 ''We're trying to achieve a world-class project that everybody would love and use, one that also pays us a lot of rent,'' said Diana Taylor, chairwoman of the Hudson River Park Trust's board. ''We're looking for a project that satisfies the community and the needs of the park. It's a delicate balance, but I'm really excited.''
 Pier 57 extends the length of nearly three football fields into the Hudson. The original wooden pier was destroyed by fire in 1947 and was rebuilt, with a two-story building, five years later atop three hollow concrete chambers, or caissons. The Grace Lines operated the pier for 12 years, until most of New York's shipping industry moved to New Jersey and the pier became a garage.
 Hudson River Park, established in 1998, has been built with state and city funds, but it must raise its own budget for operations and maintenance. The pier is on the National Register of Historic Places, meaning that developers could qualify for special tax credits.
 The Durst Organization, with its partner C&K Properties, is proposing a $330 million project built around a live-music venue and restaurant and a separate marketplace with small shops, restaurants, cafes, food stalls and boutiques. The organization likens its proposed public spaces to the Greenmarket at Union Square and to Rockefeller Center.
 The organization says that the Children's Museum of Manhattan has expressed interest in moving to the pier. The plans include a small marina on the north side of the pier, and on the south side, docks for ferries, commercial vessels, fishing boats, sailboats and educational boats or barges. There would be a rooftop ''pleasure garden,'' featuring miniature golf and other amusements, and parking space in the caissons via ramps from above.
 ''I always thought this should be the Central Park of the 21st century,'' said Helena Durst, an assistant vice president at the Durst Organization who once worked as an intern at the Hudson River Park Trust. ''We're creating a truly public pier that has strong cultural and entertainment components.''
 Youngwoo & Associates, developers active in Chelsea, are proposing three ''anchors'' for their $191 million pier project, including a new home for the Phillips de Pury & Company auction house and a contemporary cultural center consisting of art galleries and concert space. Like all the proposals, it provides public access to the waterfront.
 The firm is also proposing a large public market akin to Pike Place near the Seattle waterfront, with restaurants, food stalls, craft importers and dress and jewelry designers. The third fixture, a large rooftop hall, would serve as a theater for the Tribeca Film Festival, which would also present events year-round. There would also be a parking garage in one of the caissons and an underwater discovery center with interactive exhibits about the Hudson River estuary. 
 ''This project will distinguish itself as perhaps the most high-quality cultural, historical and innovative adaptive reuse of the pier, which is both tied to a great park and one of New York's great neighborhoods,'' said James Lima, a consultant for Youngwoo.
 The $353 million proposal from the Related Companies also calls for a Pike Place-like market, as well as a large theater about which company officials say Sundance Films has expressed interest. The company, a major residential developer in New York, plans a rooftop pool and cafe, restaurants, a 91-slip marina, a public park, an education center, a 75,000-square-foot event space that includes a ballroom, and parking for 520 cars in two of the caissons.
 ''It's a diverse group of uses built around waterfront activity and open space,'' said Joanna Rose, a spokeswoman for Related. ''The proposal includes comprehensive historic preservation of the building and a state-of-the-art ecological robotic parking system.''
 Last year, Related sought to develop Pier 40, another property owned by the Hudson River Park Trust, with a permanent home for Cirque du Soleil and a second large theater. But local residents wanted to retain the pier's current soccer fields and recreational uses. The groups devised a proposal for summer camps, soccer fields and public schools, but were unable to come up with an economically viable plan.
 The trust is now reviewing its plans and suggesting changes to the legislation governing the Hudson River Park, which would make it easier to finance a project at Pier 40.

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Formerly Middle Class'' (column, Nov. 18): David Brooks should be celebrated for calling attention to the problems that those who become poor because of the economic situation will encounter and have to deal with. The irony, of course, is that for progressives, this is a time of hope and change. 
 I hope that the next big social movement Mr. Brooks predicts does not come from the formerly middle class because if it does, it would probably come in the form of the anti-immigrant nativism that is already infecting our politics. 
 We can be a great country, one that narrows the gap between rich and poor and that allows for meaningful economic mobility, and we must not let immigrant scapegoating distract from such an important national project.

HEADLINE: Weakening DVD Sales Make Hollywood Studios Nervous

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- Conventional wisdom holds that Hollywood's fortunes go up when the economy goes down. People still crave entertainment, particularly of the escapist variety, and movies remain within the budgets of most people.
That may prove true this time around, too -- ticket sales have been particularly robust in recent weeks -- but studio prosperity stopped depending on box-office results a long time ago. DVDs propel profits these days, and there is a creeping dread in the movie capital that buyer interest is plummeting as the global economic crisis worsens.
''Every studio is claiming, 'We're O.K. so far, but we've looked at the overall competitive sales data and we have some concerns,' '' said Amir Malin, a partner at Qualia Capital, an investment firm whose assets include several large film libraries.
So far, total DVD sales are down by about 4 percent for the year, with most of that weakness coming in October, according to data compiled by Warner Brothers, the largest distributor of DVDs. The independent tracking service Nielsen VideoScan paints a bleaker picture, reporting a 9 percent drop in overall DVD sales during the third quarter alone and a 22 percent decline in sales of higher-priced new titles, although its data does not include results at Wal-Mart. 
Most troubling, industrywide sales of next-generation Blu-ray discs -- promoted as a high-definition technology that will restore growth to the medium -- are growing but will miss sales projections for the year by 25 percent or more, according to Warner.
Weak consumer spending is not the only culprit. Media companies, desperate for revenue, are dumping more obscure titles on the market, leading to downward pricing pressure, according to Distribution Video and Audio, a home entertainment overstock company in Burbank, Calif. Consumers are being more selective. There are signs that digital downloads are cutting into sales.
And Blu-ray discs still cause widespread confusion in the marketplace, with shoppers doubtful Blu-ray is here to stay after a lengthy format war with a rival technology. Indeed, 57 percent of standard DVD customers say they are ''waiting to make sure Blu-ray is really the standard the industry will stick with,'' according to an industry study released last week.
''As a result, a number of consumers are sitting on the sidelines and not buying anything,'' Mr. Malin said.
Studio executives prefer to look on the bright side, saying the DVD market is stronger even in decline than other media businesses, like broadcast television. Studios say the economic downturn might actually help kindle sales of high-definition discs because the supply of Blu-ray players is likely to sharply exceed demand in the coming holiday season, pushing down prices.
A year ago, the cheapest high-definition players cost about $500, according to David Bishop, president of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. Retailers like Wal-Mart and Best Buy are now poised to sell machines at $199, with Black Friday promotions bringing the cost as low as $128. Player sales jumped in October compared with the same month a year ago, Mr. Bishop said, even as most other retailing categories had sharp declines.
Hollywood has been counting on Blu-ray to drive its crucial home entertainment business. After years of rapid increases, domestic DVD sales fell 3.2 percent last year to $15.9 billion, according to Adams Media Research. It was the first annual drop in the medium's history.
DVDs remain a blockbuster business, but any decline is cause for concern because disc sales on a worldwide basis can account for as much as 70 percent of revenue for a new film. Blu-ray discs, which use a Sony technology that includes interactive bells and whistles, typically sell for 25 percent more than standard DVDs.
Underscoring the alarm, the major studios are working to push DVDs in general and Blu-ray in particular. The studios, along with several consumer electronics companies, are spending $25 million on a television and print advertising campaign that highlights coming releases from the Walt Disney Company (''Wall-E''), Sony (''Hancock'') and Warner (''The Dark Knight'').
''We think this is a do-or-die time for Blu-ray,'' said Ron Sanders, president of Warner Home Video. ''We must get it established as a favorite holiday item.''
Individual studios, meantime, have also been mounting solo assaults. Disney released ''Sleeping Beauty'' on Blu-ray and standard DVD last month, taking the unusual step of including a free standard DVD in the Blu-ray package to spur interest. Disney is also working with Panasonic on a ''Blu-ray demystification'' television and online campaign.
Universal Studios Home Entertainment staged a lavish party last week at a Hollywood nightclub to promote the Nov. 11 release of ''Hellboy II: The Golden Army'' on DVD and Blu-ray. A spokeswoman said it had been years since the studio organized such an expensive DVD event.
Retailers also count on DVD sales, and the biggest chains are planning to put more muscle behind the category. Chains are dedicating more shelf space to the medium (at the expense of CDs and video games) and Wal-Mart plans to spend $30 million advertising home entertainment products during the holiday season, according to several studios. Best Buy is devoting more resources to in-store displays.
Last week, the presidents of home entertainment from the top seven Hollywood studios took the unusual step of participating in a joint symposium in Los Angeles that draped the high-definition push in favorable statistics. Regarding recent declines in DVD sales, Amy Jo Smith, executive director of the Digital Entertainment Group, a trade organization, told the audience, ''In the face of the current economic crisis, this is really a remarkable performance.''
Indeed, home entertainment has held its own during previous economic downturns, giving some studios hope that declines will be modest. An uptick in overall sales at Wal-Mart as the economy declines is also soothing studio nerves, although Circuit City's decision to enter bankruptcy protection poured some rain on that parade. ''We're cautiously optimistic about the fourth quarter,'' said Mr. Bishop of Sony.
Without question, DVD bright spots remain. Direct-to-DVD movies in the family genre have shown strength, with ''Tinker Bell'' from Disney easily selling a million copies in its first week in stores, well exceeding expectations.
Movies that have crossover appeal with video game enthusiasts are also proving resilient. ''Hellboy II,'' for instance, is beating sales projections by about 10 percent, according to Craig Kornblau, president of Universal Studios Home Entertainment. ''The Incredible Hulk,'' released by Universal on Oct. 21, also sold well.
''I'm feeling really bullish, and I'm not being naive,'' Mr. Kornblau said.

 Employers are shifting more health care costs onto their employees, with average annual deductibles for an individual now over $1,000 for the first time this year, The Los Angeles Times reports. According to Mercer, a benefits consulting firm, rising deductibles are being used to offset increases in premiums and rising costs. 
 Cancer Rates Higher Among Patients With H.I.V. 
 Patients with H.I.V. are living longer, but they're at a much higher risk of developing cancers of the lung, liver, head and neck, notes the Baltimore Sun, and researchers are struggling to understand why. New research from Johns Hopkins University shows patients with H.I.V. are twice as likely as those without to get cancers that had not been thought linked to the illness.
 Teen Survives Three Months Without a Heart
 A South Carolina teenager who was kept alive by an artificial heart machine for 118 days -- living without a heart after a first heart transplant failed -- left Holtz Children's Hospital in Miami on Wednesday after receiving a new heart and kidney, The Miami Herald reports. The girl was on the artificial heart machine from July 4, when a first heart transplant failed, until Oct 29. 
 OTC Viagra Gets the Cold Shoulder in Europe
 Pfizer has decided to back off its plan to sell Viagra without a prescription in Europe, saying some concerns had been expressed by European regulators, The Wall Street Journal health blog reports.
 Women Protest Genital 'Reconstruction' Surgery
 Time Magazine reports on a small but growing trend among women to have genital cosmetic surgery, including labiaplasty, clitoral ''un-hooding'' and hymen reconstruction. Earlier this week, a small group of women protested the trend outside New York City's Manhattan Center for Vaginal Surgery, holding up posters that said ''No two alike.''

 Record Blood Donations
 More people in need of cash are selling their blood plasma to earn an extra $20 to $45, The Chicago Tribune reports. Donations may hit 16 million this year, up from 10 million three years earlier, according to an industry group. Pharmaceutical companies use plasma to make drugs for hemophilia and other conditions.
 Baltimore Ponders a Ban on Sidewalk Smoking
 The Baltimore City Council is considering a bill that would create smoke-free zones on sidewalks next to the city's 17 hospitals, The Baltimore Sun reports. Sidewalk smokers would be subject to a $50 fine if the bill passes.
 Emotional Consequences for Bullied Children
 Though not all children who are bullied by their peers suffer long-lasting effects, some may develop emotional scars that last a lifetime, USA Today reports. Jodee Blanco, author of the book ''Please Stop Laughing At Us,'' says her only crime as a child was being different.
 Tainted Meat
 A potentially deadly intestinal bacterium called Clostridium difficile, which usually infects hospital patients, has been showing up in supermarket meats, msnbc.com reports, raising the possibility that domestic animals may be a source of infections.
 Frozen Dinners Recalled
 Nestle is recalling three types of frozen Lean Cuisine entrees after small bits of plastic were discovered in the foods; the recalled entrees are the pesto chicken with bow tie pasta, the chicken Mediterranean and chicken Tuscan, The Los Angeles Times reports.

 New Questions on Steroids 
 A class of steroid drugs used in premature babies and in pregnant women at risk for a preterm delivery have been found to cause irreversible damage to brain cells in animal studies, USA Today reports.
 The 'Nocebo' Effect
 Consumers may think it's wise to read the warning labels on medications they take, but doing so can trigger the very symptoms they've read about, a phenomenon called the ''nocebo effect,'' The Wall Street Journal reports.
 An Epidemic of Kidney Disease
 The number of Americans suffering from chronic kidney disease, which is caused by uncontrolled high blood pressure and diabetes, has increased to 26 million, up from about 20 million a decade ago, The New York Times reports. One cause, according to researchers: the U.S. population is aging and becoming increasingly obese.
 A Son's Controversial Recovery
 A mother chronicles what she describes as her son's recovery from an autism-spectrum disorder in The Washington Post, saying his is one of a number of cases being studied by researchers. While some children have improved, most seem to have ongoing problems such as social phobias, the author says, and experts are not sure how to define recovery or whether it exists.
 Next, a Push for Health Care Reform
 Tough economic times may spur fundamental health care reform after President-elect Barack Obama takes office, The Los Angeles Times reports. Hospitals are faced with increasing numbers of uninsured patients, businesses are worried about escalating health costs, and some liberal groups see the federal government's bailout package of the financial sector as a relevant precedent.

LENGTH: 1382 words

HEADLINE: Global Exchange, Early Version

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Macroeconomically speaking, nations float or sink as one in a global age. Connectivity, we are learning, is the new history. But in fact this is nothing new. It has been true for some 4,000 years, and that is the subject of ''Beyond Babylon: Art, Trade and Diplomacy in the Second Millennium B.C.,'' a big, prescient, concentration-taxing exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
 It is the latest in the museum's illustrious line of panoramic archaeological shows, and a direct sequel to the 2003 ''Art of the First Cities,'' which covered the third millennium B.C. Of American institutions, only the Met has the resources to pull off such projects, which depend as much on diplomatic clout as on cash, and which always carry the risk that long-made plans will capsize on the shifting tides of international politics. 
 ''Beyond Babylon'' has not escaped trouble. In a discreet wall card near the beginning of the show, the Met thanks the Syrian government for its willingness to lend important objects to the exhibition, but expresses ''deep regret that recent legislation in the United States has made it too difficult and risky for the planned loans to proceed.'' That legislation, an amendment made in January to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, permits private individuals claiming to be victims of state-sponsored terrorism to file liens against property belonging to that state while the property, which could include museum loans, is in the United States. 
 The Met submitted applications for immunity from seizure for all the borrowed foreign works -- including pieces from Armenia, Georgia, Greece, Lebanon and Turkey, as well as Syria -- but finally decided that the amendment jeopardized the Syrian loans, so decided not to go through with them. 
 These objects, 55 in all -- stone sculptures; fresco fragments; ultrarefined goldwork, including a stupendous bowl from the ancient city of Ugarit -- are in the catalog. There you can see how important a role they played in the internationalist narrative conceived by Joan Aruz, the curator in charge of the Met's department of ancient Near Eastern art. 
 Still, with some 300 objects from other sources, there is more than enough material in the galleries to see and absorb. This is not a quick-take exhibition. Many pieces are small and intimate, made to be worn, handled and easily transported for sale or exchange: passed from hand to hand, from land to shipboard, and across seas to markets in other, often distant lands.
 For viewers who equate archaeological with monumental, the reduced scale can require some adjustment. The allure of cylinder seals, tiny, carved objects that fully reveal their images only when an impression is made, may at first be hard to grasp. But just a glance at an impression taken from one northern Assyrian seal, of a lithe stag leaping through brush and, it seems, scattering sparks as he goes, will be a convincer.
 If the size of such intricately made things encourages slow perusal, so does the proliferation of wall texts. Dense with place names, dates and information, they give the show the pace of a lavishly illustrated book, one composed of many short chapters broken up into subsections accompanied by occasional maps.
 Using an acoustic guide, the museum equivalent of E-ZPass, will speed up the tour. But a patient, step-by-step approach, looking and reading and looking again, is the best way to track the complex cultural interactions that made the ancient Near Eastern and Mediterranean regions in the Bronze Age (roughly 2200-800 B.C.) the proto-global phenomenon that they were. 
 At the Met these interactions begin in Babylon, the melting pot city made powerful by Hammurabi (1792-1750 B.C.) and the source of an eclectic art. A bronze statue of a kneeling soldier, his face masked with gold, his finger to his lips as if asking for silence, was a votive offering to a Sumerian deity of an earlier age, while a ceramic goddess with wings and talons for feet is an exuberant arrival from cultural sources unknown. 
 Referred to by archaeologists as ''The Queen of the Night,'' she is so hybrid a creation that she was at one time labeled a fake. She is now considered authentic, but authentically what is the question.
 Beyond this point, the geographic scope of networking expands exponentially, much of it driven by practical needs. The Bronze Age is named for an alloy of copper and tin essential to advancing technology, though its two basic ingredients were rarely found in the same place, requiring cooperative trade to bring them together. 
 Such exchanges also embraced all kinds of other things, from raw materials to manufactured goods to intellectual and aesthetic influences. And by the middle of the Bronze Age, the eastern Mediterranean was bristling with commercial interdependencies, each of which had its own links to far-flung inland sources.
 Byblos, a coastal city in the Levant, just north of present-day Beirut, was a major supplier of raw materials to Egypt and a sponge for all things Egyptian. The Obelisk Temple excavated there has yielded hundreds of small male votive figures. (A handful are in this show.) Wearing cone-shaped hats and gold skirts, they clearly reflect Egyptian models. So does an exquisite gold image of a vulture with outstretched wings, though whether it was imported or locally made we don't know. 
 Egypt itself functioned as a kind of cultural collection agency, equally in love with oldness and newness. Copper chests discovered in 1936 in a temple at Tod, near Luxor, were filled with non-Egyptian objects. The chest on view in the Met show includes Central Asian amulets, silver cups from Anatolia or Syria and fluted silver bowls with wavelike patterns associated with Minoan Crete. 
 Most exotic of all are the samples of raw and cut lapis lazuli, a blue stone mined primarily in Afghanistan. Some of these things were probably already antiquities at the time they were hidden away.
 For a truly cornucopian example of multiculturalism, though, nothing matches the contents of the Late Bronze Age merchant ship recovered from the sea off the southern coast of Turkey. Discovered by a sponge diver in 1984 and considered the oldest surviving example of a seagoing ship, it probably sank around 1300 B.C., packed with cargo representing a dozen cultures, from Nubia to the Balkans. 
 Although the ship's home port is unknown, it appears to have traveled a circular route through the Mediterranean and Aegean, stopping in Greece, Crete, Turkey, Syria and Egypt, picking up and unloading as it went. Bulk materials included copper ingots, Cypriot pottery, African wood and Near Eastern textiles, all for waiting markets. 
 Divers also found luxury items, possibly personal possessions of the ship's crew and passengers. Examples of ivory containers in the form of ducks have parallels with Egyptian prototypes, but were probably made in Mediterranean Asia. The two sources merge in a figure found in a tomb: a nude female swimmer with a chic, Nile-style pageboy who is hitching a ride behind an ivory-headed bird. 
 More precious and enigmatic is a standing bronze figure of a woman, probably a goddess, her head and face still covered with the sheet gold that may once have encased her whole body in a radiant epidermis. The exhibition catalog suggests that she might be a talismanic charm intended to protect the ship from harm. 
 Harm came anyway, as it did to much of the Mediterranean world, around 1200 B.C. with the arrival of mysterious, sea-based invaders, who conquered most of the great maritime cities, interrupting trade and easy cultural exchange, and bringing on a dark age, a depression. The depression -- or was it severe recession? -- didn't last forever. The passion for acquisition, exchange and accumulation survived it, as it always does. 
 This passion is, of course, our own. It is one reason that we can, if we try, identify with the diverse people who, thousands of years ago, made the objects in this show. The globalist, all-in-it-together world model they invented is another reason. Their dark age could be one too. 
 ''Beyond Babylon: Art, Trade and Diplomacy in the Second Millennium B.C.'' runs through March 15 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art; (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org.

HEADLINE: Cost Cutting Helps Dell Profit Exceed Forecasts

BYLINE: By ASHLEE VANCE; An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the number of stores where Dell is selling computers. It is 20,000, not 17,000.

 BODY:
Dell, one of the world's largest makers of personal computers, reported better-than-expected earnings on Thursday as the company's cost-cutting efforts -- including the elimination of 8,300 jobs over the last year -- blunted the pain from falling revenues in the early stages of the world economic slowdown.
 With most economists predicting that the deepening slump will hammer corporate technology spending over the next year, Dell said it intended to keep slicing costs and would be cautious with its $8.9 billion cash hoard even as it realigns its business model from a direct-sales model to one that relies more on retailers to sell its laptops and desktop PCs. 
 Dell, based in Round Rock, Tex., reported revenue of $15.16 billion in the third quarter, which ended Oct. 31. That was a 3 percent drop from the same quarter a year earlier and more than a billion dollars shy of the $16.22 billion that analysts had expected, according to ThomsonReuters.
 But the company's profits greatly exceeded Wall Street's forecasts, largely because of the company's strong emphasis on cost cutting and a gradual shift toward more profitable products.
 Dell posted net income of $727 million for the third quarter, a 5 percent drop from the $766 million it earned a year ago. However, stock buybacks reduced the number of shares outstanding by 14 percent over the last year, so on a per-share basis, net income for the quarter rose 9 percent to 37 cents, compared with 34 cents a year ago. Wall Street analysts expected net income of 31 cents a share.
 Dell's shares, which have tumbled from $28.40 over the last year, closed at $9.81 in regular trading Thursday, down 54 cents. The stock recouped those losses in after-hours trading as investors digested the earnings report, which was released after the market closed.
 Over the last two years, Dell's earnings have often arrived well outside of Wall Street's forecasts. The company has oscillated between increasing profits and reducing prices to chase market share. 
 For about the last year and a half, Dell has been revamping to increase its retail presence and shift a greater percentage of its sales to higher-profit products like laptops, computer servers and services. Dell embarked on this strategy after rivals, especially Hewlett-Packard, proved more competitive on cost and wooed away consumers who wanted to see products in stores before buying them. 
 But Dell is seeing far more immediate effects from layoffs and changes in its production model. After years of making all of its products at company-owned plant, Dell said on Thursday that it now builds one-quarter of its products through contract manufacturers, mimicking its rivals. 
 Dell now finds itself trying to navigate difficult product and structural transitions while consumers and businesses have curtailed their spending on all technology products. Companies ranging from technology giants like Intel and Cisco Systems to retailers like Best Buy have warned of a sudden, drastic drop in sales. 
 Dell, however, has tried to turn the poor economy into a positive by claiming that its sophisticated supply and order systems let it react more quickly to fluctuations in demand. ''We are ahead in seeing the decline in the market given our model, versus being buffered by a distribution channel,'' said Brian T. Gladden, Dell's chief financial officer.
 The company had plenty of declining markets to contend with. Sales of PCs fell 14 percent, and sales of servers and networking gear dropped 5 percent. In the Americas, where Dell gets 48 percent of its revenue, sales fell 8 percent. 
 Still, some analysts focused on Dell's bright spots during the quarter, which included rising sales to consumers, higher services revenue and significant cost reductions. 
 ''In any kind of turnaround situation, results can be choppy,'' said Louis Miscioscia, an analyst with Cowen & Company. ''But Dell's performance here was well above our expectations, especially given that the environment was very difficult.''
 H.P., one of Dell's major rivals, issued preliminary fourth-quarter results on Tuesday, reporting a modest increase in sales after excluding revenue from its recent acquisition of Electronic Data Systems. More important, H.P. felt comfortable enough to present Wall Street with relatively upbeat guidance for its next fiscal year, sending its shares soaring. 
 H.P. benefits from a vast amount of revenue from software, services and printer ink. Sales in these areas tend to repeat like clockwork and are often tied to long-term deals. Dell, by contrast, is more dependent on consumer and corporate spending fluctuations on hardware. 
 Because of the state of the economy, Dell declined to provide any projections of how results might look in the next quarter or the next year. 
 The rise of wireless technology and slicker, lighter, cheaper products have driven customers toward laptops. Many consumers prefer to ogle and handle laptops in retail stores rather than buy them online or by phone. Dell was late in getting into such stores, where H.P. and its sister brand, Compaq, hold a leading position. As of the most recent count, Dell is in 20,000 stores worldwide. 
 Dell also once outflanked competitors by putting the latest and greatest components into new computers and quickly passing on lower component costs to customers. Over the last few years, rivals have largely caught up. Customers also seem less driven to chase the latest chips since software makers have failed to produce applications that can tap into all that current chips have to offer. 
 Ultimately, however, Dell appears capable of weathering these challenges -- and the wobbly economy -- about as well as its peers. The question is how Dell's cost cutting and its decision to turn down low-margin deals will fare in a protracted slump, which might encourage rivals to start a price war. 
 ''It's difficult to continue to show profits when the top-line revenue is going down,'' said David Bailey, an analyst with Goldman Sachs.

HEADLINE: Swiss Central Bank Cuts Its Key Rate in Half

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: ZURICH, Switzerland 

 BODY:
The Swiss National Bank, the country's central bank, cut its key interest rate in half to 1 percent on Thursday, its second reduction this month. 
 The central bank's decision Thursday comes amid expectations other central banks, including the Federal Reserve in Washington will also cut rates further to support growth.
 Before this month, the Swiss bank had reduced its rates only once in five-and-a-half years.
 Falling prices give central banks room to lower interest rates. The cuts can ignite economic activity, but currencies often suffer as investors move their money in search of better returns.
 Inflation in Switzerland has dropped markedly as energy and commodity prices have eased. It is expected to fall below 2 percent by year-end -- a crucial threshold that some banks look to as conducive to growth.

HEADLINE: A King Becomes the Fool In a South Seas Scandal

BYLINE: By JASON ZINOMAN

 BODY:
Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there was a financial collapse. If that doesn't sound like much of a fairy tale, then you need to see the whimsical ''Jester of Tonga,'' a rare example of puppet theater about bad investments. 
 Joseph Silovsky, the creator and star of this scrappy, delightful one-hour solo show, has been performing since 1990, but he might be better known as the resident mad inventor of the experimental theater scene. The go-to guy for mechanical props on less than a Broadway budget, he created the stunning moon for two of Radiohole's recent shows and built robots for the National Theater of the United States of America and Richard Maxwell. 
 His new work, which also includes a robot in the title role, began after he read a short wire-service article in The New York Times in 2001 about a bizarre financial scandal in Tonga, the South Pacific archipelago. The country had made $26 million selling citizenship and passports to Asians, particularly Hong Kong Chinese concerned about the takeover by China. Instead of investing the fortune in Tonga, the king put it in a Bank of America checking account. Here's where the trouble begins. 
 After noticing the money accruing little interest, Jesse Bogdonoff, a bank employee, convinced the king to let him invest it, and the king made him the ''court jester.'' When the money disappeared, the king became the fool. 
 Mr. Silovsky, wearing plastic glasses and a T-shirt, imagines this tragic story as a fantastical tale, using various tools (shadow puppets, plastic figures, video screens). The bad investments are nicely explained in a series of cartoon illustrations. The relationship between king and jester is dramatized cleverly with action figures. And Mr. Silovsky has tracked down Mr. Bogdonoff and uses tape from their conversation as a monologue, spoken by the robot. 
 The show becomes less sure-footed in its second half, chronicling Mr. Silovsky's trip to Tonga, which features tangents like an encounter with an island prisoner.
 Almost all of Mr. Silovsky's props and puppets are kept in 20 old suitcases strewn around the stage of Performance Space 122. Like an old man tinkering in a junk shop, Mr. Silovsky picks one up, uses the gadgets inside and then tosses them. It's a loose style as quirky and appealing as the original news article.
 ''Jester of Tonga'' runs through Sunday at Performance Space 122, 150 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village; (212) 352-3101, ps122.org.

HEADLINE: Saving the World In Less Than a Day

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Kiefer Sutherland is back as Jack Bauer in ''24: Redemption'' this Sunday on Fox, but the title is a bit misleading. It really should be called ''2,'' not ''24,'' because this time the ticking-clock countdown is only two hours long, and it's hard for even the most ardent ''24'' believers to accept that national security can be imperiled and saved in less time than it takes to cook a roast. 
 The word ''Redemption,'' on the other hand, is quite apt. The title refers to Bauer's efforts to expiate past sins with good works, but it also suggests that the writers have embarked on a self-improvement regimen. Set in the middle of a harrowing civil war in the barely fictional African country Sangala, ''Redemption'' is a more sober, stripped-down version of ''24,'' and that's refreshing. It could almost serve as a case study for those economists who argue that the ailing auto industry could be helped best by filing for bankruptcy. 
 In this case, at least, a myriad of extraneous characters, locations and subplots have been cut, and the result is a more compact and far more satisfying vehicle for action-adventure escapism. 
 Perhaps to justify the steep price Fox is no doubt charging advertisers for spots and product placements, the network has labeled ''Redemption'' a television ''event.'' (Advertisers do get their money's worth. In one shot the close-up on the dashboard of a Hyundai Genesis is so long and intense that viewers will brace themselves for a car bomb explosion.) 
 There is no exactly right word to describe the show, since it's not really a stand-alone movie. And it's too good to be dismissed merely as a very long teaser for the seventh season of ''24,'' which begins in January, though it does set up a new premise and a fresh set of characters for the season premiere. ''Redemption'' is a mini-series in the true sense of that made-up word: a television series in miniature.
 The Counter Terrorism Unit in Los Angeles has been disbanded, and that alone relieves writers from the strain of pretending, season after season, that Southern California is the No. 1 target of Islamic terrorists -- and the fiendish Western capitalists who are so often behind the many veils of conspiracy. 
 This time, plotters in high places seek to manipulate and exploit tribal wars and civil unrest in Sangala. The villainous mastermind, Jonas Hodges (Jon Voight), is cartoonish, but the depiction of the conflict is highly realistic and compelling. A warlord intent on supplying the rebel army with troops rounds up boys and turns them into child soldiers, training -- and drugging -- them to be ruthless killers. 
 Bauer is working at a school in Sangala run by an old friend, Carl Benton (Robert Carlyle), a Special Forces veteran turned missionary. Bauer is also on the lam, running from a subpoena to testify before a Senate committee investigating the illegal use of torture by antiterrorist squads. 
 The filming was finished before the financial markets collapsed and the presidential election was decided. In this alternate reality the economy is not in recession, and the nation is imperiled not by the shortsighted greed of many but by the long-simmering malevolence of a few power brokers. 
 In Washington a new president is about to take the oath of office, but this is not a preview of a Barack Obama inauguration; Cherry Jones plays Allison Taylor, the first female president. The scene of her making history with her hand on the Bible may pain some Hillary Clinton supporters, but ''24'' has already had a black president -- two to be precise -- so gender was this series's next glass ceiling. 
 Even in this short-form version there are hints and reminders of what makes ''24'' simultaneously exhilarating and irritating: exquisitely choreographed violence and suspense come alongside clunky if gratifying caricatures. The United Nations peacekeeper with a foreign accent is an appeaser and a coward; a State Department envoy is officious and sadistic. 
 Joel Surnow, one of the creators of ''24,'' has left the series, but its jingoistic political slant has not been lifted. This is the world according to a Chuck Norris movie. Heroes like Jack Bauer can save the nation from near extinction over and over, but they will still be persecuted for niggling human rights violations by pantywaist bureaucrats.
 ''Redemption'' is at its best when it focuses on action, not the after-action reports, and its best is awfully good. If nothing else, this two-hour version of ''24'' proves that downsizing is not necessarily a bad thing.

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Board Warns of Service Cuts and Fare Increases

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
Deep cuts in subway, bus and commuter rail service could come as early as spring, followed by a double-digit rise in fares and tolls in June, transportation officials said on Thursday as they revealed a gloom-and-doom budget that came with a ''cry for help'' to elected officials to bail the authority out of its financial crisis. 
 But elected officials said they had no money to give and would wait to hear the proposals of a state commission that was seeking new revenue, which may include tolls on East River bridges and higher taxes, for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. 
 ''Neither the city nor the state has any money,'' said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, speaking at an event on Staten Island. ''There's not enough money to go around, and we're all going to have to work together.'' 
 In a statement issued by his office, Gov. David A. Paterson cited the state government's vast budget problems and signaled that he was waiting for the recommendations of the commission, which is led by Richard Ravitch, a former authority chairman. The commission is expected to make a report in early December. 
 But Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said he believed the Legislature would act to try to avoid the cuts, probably in line with Mr. Ravitch's recommendations.
 ''Clearly, he will be talking about ways to raise revenue,'' Mr. Silver said in an interview. ''I'm not afraid of reasonable, responsible tax policy, plain and simple. 
 ''I think that both the residents and the businesses of the city of New York, understanding the significance of mass transit in the city, would be understanding of some revenue raises to continue affordable mass transit.'' 
 He said he was ''optimistic'' that a solution would be found to head off the dire cuts.
 H. Dale Hemmerdinger, the current chairman of the authority, speaking at a meeting of its board, said, ''We don't want to raise fares, we don't want to cut service.'' 
 He said the service cuts and fare and toll increases were scheduled so that lawmakers would have time to come to the authority's rescue. 
 ''I hope that all the elected officials heard this board's cry for help,'' he said.
 Perhaps the most eye-catching number in the 584-page, two-volume $11 billion budget and the accompanying 19-page PowerPoint presentation was this: If the budget is approved as is, subway riders next year would pay 83 percent of the cost of operating the system, up from 69 percent this year. In other words, public subsidies would pay for only 17 percent of the costs. 
 Riders on New York City Transit local buses would pay 48 percent of bus operating costs, up from 39 percent today. 
 Those levels would be far higher than those of other public transit systems in the country, most of which receive much greater levels of public subsidy when measured as a percentage of operating costs. 
 ''There's a redistribution going on here, putting more of these expenses on the riders and less on the sectors that benefit from the transit system,'' said Gene Russianoff, the staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit rider advocacy group.
 He said that as the economy sours and taxes on the real estate and corporate sectors shrink, riders are being asked unfairly to take up the slack.
 The authority said that to plug a $1.2 billion budget gap next year, it must increase fare and toll revenues by 23 percent, which would raise an additional $670 million if the increase goes into effect in early June. 
 While officials refused to say exactly how much each fare would increase, it seemed likely that the base subway and bus fare would rise to at least $2.50 from the current $2.
 And the authority called for budget cuts of about $400 million, which would mean cutbacks in many types of bus, subway and commuter rail services. That would include the elimination of 2,800 jobs, many of them through layoffs.
 Two subway lines, the Z and the W, which overlap with other lines, would be eliminated, and two others, the G and the M, would be truncated. Many station booths would be closed, and off-peak service on buses and subways would be reduced. On the commuter lines, fewer trains would run and fare booths at many stations would close. 
 Some riders would be hit harder than others. Long Island Bus, which operates in Nassau and Suffolk Counties and eastern Queens, would see a fare increase of 43 percent. 
 Riders who use the authority's Access-a-Ride service for the disabled would pay more than double what they now pay. The Access-a-Ride fare is now equivalent to the base subway and bus fare of $2. It would be increased to double the new base fare.
 The authority's revised 2009 budget was presented to the authority's board in a packed meeting room on the fifth floor of its headquarters on Madison Avenue, near Grand Central Terminal.
 At one point, as the authority's executive director, Elliot G. Sander, was addressing the board, a man in the audience shouted at him. The police took the man out of the room and gave him a summons for disrupting the meeting. 
 Mr. Sander described the package of cuts as ''very severe, very harsh'' and ''extremely painful.'' But he said the authority would not make any cuts that would affect the safety of passengers. The cuts come as the system is experiencing its highest ridership levels in decades.
 The authority's board has until the end of December to adopt a balanced budget for next year. Mr. Sander said that he expected the governor and the Legislature to take up the issue of the authority's financing early next year and that he hoped that new financing sources would be passed into law quickly. He called March ''a drop-dead time,'' and said that if no action had been taken by then, the authority would have to begin making the service cuts. Fares and tolls would rise in June. 
 Mr. Sander said that the cuts included reductions in administrative jobs. But Andrew M. Saul, a board member, said that more should be cut at the top. 
 ''We need to do everything we can in our power to make sure this organization is really slimmed down,'' Mr. Saul said. 
 Another board member, Norman I. Seabrook, called for a 30 percent ''sin tax'' on cigarettes and alcohol to help finance mass transit. 
 State Senator Dean G. Skelos, the majority leader, and Senator Malcolm A. Smith, the minority leader, both said in statements that they were awaiting the recommendations of Mr. Ravitch, the state commission head.

HEADLINE: Drop Me Off at Broadway, 1944

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
The fleet's in this weekend, at least on 55th Street, where a radiant production of ''On the Town'' has docked at City Center through Sunday. Hop aboard the celestial subway train of Leonard Bernstein's piping, pumping, altogether transporting music -- this was the first of his handful of Broadway shows -- and you'll be whisked back to a time when New York, New York, was a wonderland of pleasure, romance and hot fun. Especially if you were a sailor with 24 hours to fill and found comely company to join you. 
 What's that? New York is still a wonderland of pleasure and hot fun? Maybe you haven't been reading the headlines. A certain global financial crisis has folks looking for fire sales, not to mention anticipating the hard times and mean streets to come. Never mind that now. Let's forget Wall Street and even Main Street for an evening, and spend a few hours on the Broadway of 1944 with a genial cast of singing sailors hitting the city like fireworks. 
 The Encores! production, directed by John Rando, is the contribution of this musicals-in-concert series to the citywide commemoration of Bernstein's 90th birthday, spearheaded by Carnegie Hall and the New York Philharmonic. The Encores! mission has always been to celebrate Broadway with the utmost integrity, and in this case the company honors Bernstein by performing all of the music in the score.
 There's a lot of it. The production is rich in dance (it may be the most dance-intensive show Encores! has done) and winning performances (particularly from Tony Yazbeck as the lovelorn sailor Gabey, and a scenery-devouring Andrea Martin as a nutso-dipso voice teacher), but it's richest of all in music. There are several ballet sequences, instant reprises, jazzy pop songs, classical spoofs and soaring ballads. Even the scene changes -- the many scene changes -- are accompanied by long stretches of lively or reflective music drawn from the themes in the songs. Instead of an overture the show opens with ''The Star-Spangled Banner,'' as it did during the original run, when Americans were at war abroad, as they are today.
 In a musical so devoted to celebrating the city in all its glorious diversity -- the show moves from Carnegie Hall to Coney Island to the Brooklyn Navy Yard -- a concert staging is at a bit of a disadvantage. (It's telling that the original production was actually the brainchild of a set designer, Oliver Smith, who suggested that the Bernstein-Jerome Robbins ballet ''Fancy Free'' could be a Broadway musical.) Mr. Rando and the Encores! team cannot produce the Brooklyn Navy Yard, of course, but they use an electronic display to take note of each stop on the train (''55th Street and 7th Avenue, 8:55 a.m.''). And they have added a second playing space behind the orchestra to accommodate more dancing. 
 Their greatest ally in bringing wartime New York to vibrant life onstage is Bernstein, whose music is a cityscape in itself, drawing on a dizzying range of styles that somehow never clash, even when they occasionally tussle competitively. It's a delight to hear the myriad musical personas in this classically trained composer playing nicely together. The strings hand off a melody to the brass sections, which welcome the woodwinds. At other times the parts of the orchestra, under the mindful music direction of Todd Ellison, seem to be gleefully elbowing one another out of the way. Hey, lay off them violins for a minute! 
 Mr. Yazbeck, who has taken a few nights off from ''Gypsy,'' in which he is a terrific Tulsa, is an even more terrific Gabey. His easy, warm, open-hearted and touchingly real performance provides the show with a firm emotional center. Gabey, you'll recall, is the wide-eyed sailor who steps off the ship and finds the girl of his dreams in a subway car -- well, a poster of her, anyway.
 The thread of a plot spins around the attempts by Gabey and his two sailor buddies, Ozzie (Christian Borle) and Chip (Justin Bohon), to track down Gabey's dream girl, Miss Turnstiles for June, with just the few clues on the poster for help. ''She's not a career girl but she's studying singing and ballet at Carnegie Hall and painting at the museum,'' Mr. Yazbeck reads, with a bloom of wonder in his voice. ''She is a frail and flowerlike girl, who's a champion at polo, tennis and shot put.'' 
 The breakneck race to find this singing, dancing, shot-putting needle in the haystack of the city is embellished by a sheaf of comic vignettes, some more diverting than others. Betty Comden and Adolph Green, who wrote the book and lyrics, keep the gags coming at a steady pace. But by the time the crazy lady has run across the stage three or four times, shaking her handbag in outrage at that cheeky sailor, you're ready to call the cops on her. (David Ives has done his usual editing of the original book.)
 Other comic bits are somewhat flattened by the stripped-down staging. If the production has a flaw, it's probably an insurmountable one. Given the constraints of having a big orchestra plopped onstage, you can't really achieve the whippet-at-a-run pacing that would keep the more languorous passages from seeming overextended. (Gorgeously as it is performed by Mr. Yazbeck -- your heart almost breaks as his wide-stretched arms, hungering for an embrace, close on emptiness -- the ''Lonely Town'' number seems go on forever.) 
 Mr. Borle has a great comic's mug, with popping eyes ready to leer, and his seduction of (or is it by?) the silvery-voiced Jennifer Laura Thompson, as the bookish but lusty Clair de Loone, is played with pert charm. Mr. Bohon's acting is a little indistinct, but he's a lively dancer and exudes a sense of awkwardness that's right for his romance with the domineering cab driver Hildy. In that role, the gifted Leslie Kritzer could profitably ease up on the sexual innuendo (Mr. Rando could throughout, actually), but she sings the boogie-woogie ''I Can Cook Too'' with sharp musical finesse. As Clair's fiance, Michael Cumpsty provides a skilled caricature of a clueless aristocrat. 
 Warren Carlyle has provided serviceable, sometimes inventive choreography in the Robbins style to supplement Robbins's few extant numbers: ''New York, New York,'' ''Times Square Ballet'' and ''Ya Got Me,'' all recreated for ''Jerome Robbins' Broadway.'' Mr. Yazbeck is an ardent, graceful dancer, and Jessica Lee Goldyn, who plays the subway pinup, Ivy Smith, is a lush presence who moves fluidly. In dance terms, of course, it's the skyrocketing sailors who are the show's signature motif, and the numbers in which they fling lusty energy around are what you take home: the bell-bottomed legs flared against a morning sky, the knotted scarf a flag in the wind.
 Then again, if dance isn't your thing, there's Ms. Martin to divert you. In the broad-as-Broadway role of Madame Maude P. Dilly, the terminally soused voice teacher who staggers in and out of the show at regular intervals, she earns a hearty laugh on just about every line. Sometimes two to a syllable, believe it or not. It's lowdown comic acting of a very high order, and it's perfect punctuation for this valentine to a city that embraces the high, the low and everything in between.

 GOOD NEWS: AL QAEDA DECLINES.
 Bad News: So Does United States.
 A new study by American intelligence agencies suggests that Al Qaeda, while still a major threat, could soon be on the decline. Reasons include its having alienated Muslim supporters with indiscriminate killing and its inattention to practical problems. The prediction is one of the few bright spots in the generally gloomy report, which forecasts a decline in the United States' world dominance. PAGE A13 
 CHINA PLEDGES DAIRY SAFEGUARDS
 The Chinese government, struggling to contain the fallout from a scandal over contaminated milk and eggs, announced a wide range of food safety measures intended to rein in abuses in the dairy industry. The State Council, China's cabinet, issued several new rules that it says will govern all aspects of the industry, from cow breeding and animal feed to the packaging and sale of milk. PAGE A12 
 FINNS SEE A FAMILIAR PATTERN
 Some Finns are wondering if they see something familiar in photographs taken during the Russia-Georgia conflict in August: Are Russian soldiers wearing uniforms with a Finnish style of camouflage? Nyet, Russia says. ''We have 100 different kinds of camouflage,'' said an official whose company supplies the Russian army. ''Why would we take the Finns'?'' PAGE A6
 THE SOFT SIDE OF CRIME
 Yaakov Alperon was dubbed Israel's Tony Soprano, at least until he was killed by a bomb planted in his rented car as he drove along a busy Tel Aviv thoroughfare this week. But would an American crime boss have allowed a local model to live in the family home as part of a television reality show? And would his widow invite the news media to share in her grief, weeping for the cameras? PAGE A12
 TO ZIMBABWE, COME WHAT MAY
 Former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and former President Jimmy Carter will go to Zimbabwe on a humanitarian mission this weekend. They have decided to ignore a front-page article in a newspaper considered to be President Robert Mugabe's mouthpiece saying that the government of Zimbabwe has advised them not to visit. PAGE A13
 THE ISSUE BEHIND IRAQI WRANGLING
 The security agreement that would govern the last three years of the American military presence in Iraq, which is nominally at the center of the wrangling in Parliament, appears not to be the main problem. Many of those who are threatening to vote against ratification of the agreement openly admit that they approve of its terms. But they worry what would come after. PAGE A10

 WILL THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE
 Prevail on Same-Sex Marriage?
 When the California Supreme Court begins weighing arguments over same-sex marriage -- again -- in December, some 18,000 gay marriages could hang in the balance. The central issue is whether California voters -- who have repeatedly used ballot measures to rewrite state law -- overstepped their bounds by passing Proposition 8, which added 14 words to the state Constitution stating that only male-female marriage would be ''valid or recognized.''

 CANDIDATE FOR HOMELAND SECURITY
 President-elect Barack Obama is planning to name Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona, a border state governor who lives and breathes the often-heated immigration debate, to head the Homeland Security Department, transition officials said. Ms. Napolitano has often been publicly critical of the Bush administration's policies regarding border enforcement and illegal immigration. PAGE A16 
 MENTAL STATE OF SOLDIER QUESTIONED
 A soldier and war veteran charged in the murder and sexual assault of a woman in Colorado last month faces accusations that he also raped a 14-year-old girl and sexually assaulted a third woman, an internal Army document states. The document also raises serious questions about his mental state during his time on duty and whether he should have been deployed to Iraq in 2007. PAGE A21
 SURGE IN EARLY-DECISION APPLICANTS
 With a recession, selective colleges and universities that use binding early-decision programs to lock in part of their freshman classes thought that they would find fewer students ready to commit, and would lose many budget-conscious families to public universities. Instead they are reporting large jumps in early-decision applicants. Dartmouth, Middlebury and Bowdoin are all up about 10 percent over last year, and Pomona is up 20 percent. PAGE A20

 THE DECLINE OF PREMIUM CLASS
 The worsening economy is taking a toll on Europe's flagship airlines, with dwindling sales of first- and business-class tickets helping to drive the decline along with steep fuel prices during the summer.

 ETERNAL OBJECTS OF DESIRE
 Lost, Found and Immortalized
 Like the precarious and analogous battlefield of love, ''Art and Love in Renaissance Italy'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art has its ups and downs. And, just like the epic battle between the sexes, it can be a bit inconsistent. The 160 works cover the mediums of jewelry, sculpture and painting, and there's even some Renaissance pornography. Some of the works verge on folk art and others can be pedestrian. But hey, that's how love goes, Roberta Smith writes. Page C23 
 SOLID AMERICAN LIFE, PLUS VIOLENCE
 At first, ''Lake City'' seems to be a film about solid American life. Sissy Spacek plays a self-sufficient farmer in rural Virginia contemplating the sale of her homestead. Enter a wastrel son, with a mysterious boy in tow, who could be his son. Now the movie seems to be about families coming together, despite some past dysfunction. Oh, and then the drug dealers show up, and nobody's quite sure what you end up with then, Stephen Holden writes. Page C10 
 CHINESE TRADE IN VASES AND PLATES
 Americans were able to say ''bring out the fine china'' beginning in 1785, when the first American trade mission from China brought tea, textiles and ''china wares.'' Now you can look at some of those ''wares'' at Kentshire Galleries, which is hosting a selling exhibition of Chinese export porcelain in its Manhattan shop. There are even ancient Chinese copies of even older Dutch Delft tulip vases. Prices for the 100 works range from $1,900 to $500,000. Page C27 
 SOCIAL INTERACTION, JUST ADD PLUG
 In the days of hallowed antiquity, when social networking implied an in-person interaction, the drama ''Continuous City,'' directed by Marianne Weems, would never have happened. The piece, about the creation of a social networking site, is heavy on the technology, but one catches oneself wishing that technology didn't make for the most vivid character in a play that still involves people, Jason Zinoman writes.

 LIKE AN '80S COVER BAND, BUT NOT
 Hinder is a multimillion-selling band from Oklahoma with an identity crisis. But at least it's consistent. Its songs waver between bad-boy rock star sensibility and power ballads worthy of Bon Jovi's heyday. The band headlined at the Nokia theater, with Trapt opening, and kept it strictly at the glam-rock camaraderie with a poised stage presence reminiscent of Aerosmith, Jon Pareles writes. Page C5

 In recent years, the Kremlin has stoked anti-Americanism with official and semiofficial propaganda.

HEADLINE: TV Ads Contribute to Childhood Obesity, Economists Say

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
Banning fast food advertisements from children's television programs would reduce the number of overweight children in the U.S. by 18 percent and decrease the number of overweight teens by 14 percent, economists have estimated in a new study. 
 The researchers used several statistical models to link obesity rates to the amount of time spent viewing fast food advertising, finding that viewing more fast food commercials on television raises the risk of obesity in children. The study appears in this month's issue of The Journal of Law and Economics.
 ''There is not a lot of evidence that overweight kids are more likely to watch TV than other kids,'' said Michael Grossman, professor of economics at the City University of New York. ''We're arguing the causality is how many messages are aired -- seeing more of these messages is leading people to put on weight.'' The study's co-authors are Shin-Yi Chou, an economist at Lehigh College, and Inas Rashad, an economist at Georgia State University.
 But the researchers' estimate relies on older data gathered in the late 1990s, according to Elaine Kolish, a spokesman for the Council of Better Business Bureaus. Since then, two of the largest fast food chains -- Burger King and McDonald's -- and more than a dozen other packaged food companies have signed on to the council's Children's Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative, she said, pledging to advertise only their healthier products to children under age 12. 
 As a result, both Burger King and McDonald's now air ads for children's meals including apple sticks and low-fat milk. ''I can't help think that two huge chains advertising apples and milk to kids is going to be affecting children's preferences,'' Ms. Kolish said.
 Kelly Brownell, director of Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy, said reliable estimates of television's impact on childhood obesity are hard to calculate because of the many assumptions statisticians must make. ''That said, food marketing is a blight on the landscape of our children and has been shown time and again to have a negative impact,'' he added.
 Only three countries -- Sweden, Norway and Finland -- have banned commercial sponsorship of children's programs, and study authors acknowledged that the chances of such a ban in the U.S. are slim.
 But since ads are a tax-deductible business expense, the researchers also analyzed the potential impact of eliminating federal tax deductions for fast food ads aimed at children. Such a move would curb childhood obesity by 5 to 7 percent, the analysis found.

 BODY:
After the recent drop in auction prices, artworks that were once out of reach for museums have suddenly become affordable again. 
 This fall the Museum of Modern Art was able to buy a sculpture by the Arte Povera artist Pino Pascali (1935-68) and a floor piece by the Minimalist sculptor Carl Andre for less than their auction estimates. 
 ''One silver lining to the current economic crisis is that there are a lot of serious acquisitions to be made that would not have been possible a year ago,'' said Ann Temkin, MoMA's chief curator of painting and sculpture. 
 Mr. Pascali's ''Bridge,'' a braided steel-wool sculpture from 1968 that had been heavily promoted by Christie's, failed to sell at the auction house's Italian sale in London on Oct. 20. Christie's had estimated that it would bring $2.7 million to $3.7 million. Ms. Temkin said she had wanted the piece but did not have the green light from the museum's acquisitions committee to bid for it. 
 So when she heard that it went unsold, she contacted Christie's and was able to make a deal. (She declined to say what the museum paid for it.) 
 ''It's a very rare thing,'' she said of the nearly 30-foot-long hanging hammocklike sculpture. Pascali ''died at 33,'' she noted, so he ''had an unusually short career.'' Until the acquisition MoMA had only one of his pieces, ''Machine Gun,'' a 1966 sculpture fashioned from reworked parts of a Fiat 500. 
 Ms. Temkin said ''Bridge'' was a quintessential example of the Arte Povera movement, in which artists embraced materials that seemed antithetical to art-making traditions. She said the piece, taken together with work by artists like Richard Serra, Bruce Nauman and Eva Hesse, told ''a story of a pivotal moment in the late 1960s.'' 
 ''Equivalent V,'' a 120-piece brick rectangular floor piece by Mr. Andre executed from 1966 to 1969, carried an estimate of $1.2 million to $1.6 million at Sotheby's contemporary auction on Nov. 11 in New York. MoMA was the only bidder and walked away with the piece for $1 million. 
 Ms. Temkin said ''Equivalent V'' was especially significant because it was the artist's first floor work. MoMA has another floor piece by Mr. Andre, ''144 Lead Square,'' made later in 1969. 
 Ms. Temkin said that while the museum was committed to pushing forward and acquiring 21st-century works, ''we are keenly aware of catching up by bringing classics of contemporary art into the collection while there is still time.'' 
 WASHINGTON AT YALE
 The Yale University Art Gallery has also been shopping at auction recently, although it was not exactly snapping up bargains. This month it purchased a rare miniature of George Washington by the British-born painter Robert Field at Skinner in Boston for $303,000, more than 10 times its high estimate of $30,000. 
 Robin Jaffee Frank, a curator in the department of American paintings and sculpture at the Yale museum, said that while she could not discuss the price, ''I can say that this work was invaluable to us.'' 
 ''It was worth every penny,'' Ms. Frank said. ''When I held it in my hands I was so astonished by how remarkably unfaded it was.'' 
 This was an important acquisition for Yale because it reunites the portrait with another miniature portrait by Field, of Martha Washington. ''Both are signed and dated 1801,'' Ms. Frank said. ''Martha commissioned them a year after George Washington died to commemorate his life.'' 
 Martha Washington then gave the miniature to Sarah Stuart, the daughter of Martha's step-daughter, Eleanor Calvert Custis Stuart. It has been passed down through the family ever since. 
 The American art galleries at Yale are closed for a renovation and expansion that is to be completed around 2011. Both miniatures will be included in the traveling exhibition ''Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness: American Art from the Yale University Art Gallery'' when it makes its next stop, at the Seattle Art Museum in February. 
 BRONZED PERFORMERS
 Live street performers often converge on Doris C. Freedman Plaza, at the entrance to Central Park on Fifth Avenue at 60th Street. Now three bronze sculptures that pay homage to this urban phenomenon can be seen alongside the real thing. 
 Created by the German multimedia artist Christian Jankowski, the three human-scale statues were inspired by street performers Mr. Jankowski saw in Barcelona. The group, called ''Living Sculptures,'' was shown last year in Barcelona, Berlin and London and will remain on view in New York through May 1.
 ''It will be interesting to see how people react to them,'' said Rochelle Steiner, director of the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit organization that presents art around the city and organized the installation. ''I first saw them in Barcelona and thought it was so smart as a project, because it gets us to think about monumentality.'' 
 FLOOR IT, PICASSO
 Indulging his passion for cars and unconventional art projects, the South African artist Robin Rhode created a painting on a football-field-size canvas last week, using a new BMW as a paintbrush. Hose pipes installed on the front and back tires were filled with paints of varying colors. Using a special remote-
 control device, Mr. Rhode sprayed the paint onto the canvas by using the motion of the car. The filmmaker Jake Scott, a son of Ridley Scott, captured the entire process with 45 cameras he had installed in Downey Studios in Los Angeles. 
 The finished canvas will be shown along with the film from March 25 through April 8 in Vanderbilt Hall, the 12,000-square-foot space with pink marble floors and 48-foot ceilings just off the main concourse of Grand Central Terminal. 
 ''As an artist I am always keen to collaborate with other disciplines like dance, music and now film,'' Mr. Rhodes said in a telephone interview.
 ''I'm a pure car enthusiast,'' he added. ''But I also liked the idea of going through childlike actions to create a painting that is a way to engage with technology and design.''

HEADLINE: $2.5 Billion Is Added To Bailout For Iceland

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
Iceland finally received international backing for its bailout plan on Thursday, while Turkey appeared to be heading for a rescue package of its own.
 Nordic countries followed up a $2.1 billion loan to Iceland by the International Monetary Fund with an additional $2.5 billion. 
 The finance ministers of Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden said in a joint statement that the money would help Iceland stabilize its economy and exchange rate, and reduce its public debt over the medium term.
 ''The work with implementing the I.M.F. program will not be easy,'' they said, ''but given appropriate measures we believe that there is a good basis for rebalancing the economy.''
 The monetary fund said late Wednesday that its board had approved the Icelandic deal, making $827 million immediately available. The rest will be paid in eight equal installments, subject to quarterly reviews. The fund said the loan would fill about 42 percent of Iceland's 2008-10 financing gap.
 Germany, Britain and the Netherlands had held up the aid package in a dispute over compensation payments for overseas depositors in the Icesave unit of Landsbanki. The three have agreed to extend additional credit to Iceland that will enable it to repay the depositors about $26,000 each, in line with European Union law.
 Poul Thomsen, the head of the I.M.F. mission to Iceland, said in a conference call that the total compensation for Icesave customers would be $5 billion to $6 billion.
 All told, Iceland is borrowing at least $10 billion, or about $33,000 for each of its 300,000 residents.
 The increasing severity of the global credit and economic crises has put great stress on many smaller and developing nations as capital flees to Japan, Europe and the United States.
 The Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, said Thursday on television that he hoped a deal with the monetary fund would be reached by next week. An official in his party said earlier that a deal of $20 billion to $40 billion was likely.
 Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the monetary fund's managing director, said Saturday that there was ''some disagreement'' on the size and terms of a bailout package, which would be Turkey's fourth in 10 years. But he said he was confident that a deal would be reached quickly.
 In addition to Iceland, the monetary fund has recently announced bailout programs for Hungary, Pakistan, Serbia and Ukraine, and created a credit line of as much as $100 billion for healthy countries with liquidity shortages. The Latvian finance minister, Atis Slakteris, said Thursday that Latvia would seek help from the fund to ensure the stability of its financial sector.
 Belarus is also talking with the fund about aid.
 Having gotten its bailout, Iceland now faces a long road to restoring its economy and its currency, the krona. The country's financial markets have been effectively frozen for the last month. Mr. Thomsen, the monetary fund official, said that the immediate needs were to get foreign exchange market operating and to stabilize the krona.

HEADLINE: Invisible and Free Labor: The Role of Caregivers

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Veterans' Families Seek Aid for Caregiver Role'' (front page, Nov. 12): 
 Military families that struggle to pay the bills and care for their loved ones are the most glaring example of a much broader care crisis in America.
 Our economy is built upon the invisible and free labor of millions of Americans who provide essential care to their families. Yet we regard this work of caring for children, the elderly, the sick or disabled as secondary to other forms of work. As a result, caregivers (mostly women) who exit the paid work force to care for their families suffer devastating long-term economic consequences.
 Similarly, workers who make their living providing care for children and the elderly endure meager pay and lack the basic labor protections afforded other workers. Low-income women, and single mothers in particular, suffer most. It's about time we stopped free-riding on our fellow citizens and started recognizing, in law and policy, the value of their work.

HEADLINE: Crude Oil Falls Below $50 a Barrel

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
After rising to dizzying heights this summer, the price of oil is in the middle of a hair-raising drop.
 Oil prices fell to their lowest level in more than three years, dropping below $50 a barrel on Thursday, after shedding close to $100 since July as an ailing global economy pared consumption. 
 Just as an economic boom had driven up commodity prices for six years, the present slowdown means the world needs less oil, which is depressing prices. Thursday's drop came as a spate of new indicators showed how badly the economy was faring amid fears about the health of the financial system. 
 The sudden reversal has startled many experts. Oil futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled at $49.62 a barrel, down 7 percent, their lowest since May 2005. They have lost more than two-thirds of their value after settling at a peak above $145 a barrel in July.
 Some analysts predict that oil could fall to $30 to $40 a barrel as the world economy worsens.
 The pillars that had pushed up the price of oil and other commodities seem to be crumbling all at once: the American consumer is in full retreat; the Chinese economy is sputtering; financial markets are collapsing; developing countries are trimming their energy subsidies.
 The speed of the falloff is a testimony to the world's dire economic straits. As growth slows in the United States, Japan and Europe, many analysts say they believe global oil demand is headed for its first annual decline in 25 years. 
 The drop in prices could not have come soon enough for consumers. Gasoline prices are down about half since July, easing some inflationary pressures. Falling energy costs are also providing some breathing room for the economy, although they have also ignited fears of deflation -- a broad drop in prices across the economy. 
 For oil producers, the collapse is dire news. The downturn will probably herald a depressed cycle for the energy industry as markets shrink and prices drop. Dozens of large-scale projects have already been canceled or delayed because of the fall in prices and financing constraints. They include refineries in Saudi Arabia, offshore fields in Brazil and projects to exploit tar sands in Canada.
 Some experts warn that lower energy prices could set the stage for a new phase of higher prices when the economy eventually recovers, as companies are now cutting back their investments in future supplies to cope with the downturn. 
 As much as four million barrels of future oil production capacity could be jeopardized if prices remain below $60 a barrel, according to estimates by Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm. This means that the sharper the drop in prices now, the steeper the rebound might be when the economy picks up again. ''Sub-$50 oil means a lot of investments are not going to be made,'' said Philip C. Adams, an energy and utilities analyst at Gimme Credit. ''What you're probably doing is setting the stage for the next price spike.''
 In the short term, exporters are feeling the sting, and some producers are becoming desperate to stop prices from falling further. The OPEC cartel, whose members draw most of their income from oil exports, has called another emergency meeting in Cairo next week -- less than a month after its members agreed in an emergency session to trim production, to little effect on the price of oil.
 There does not seem to be much else the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries can do as demand for oil declines. Adam Sieminski, a Deutsche Bank analyst, said prices could fall as low as $30 to $35 a barrel next year. The last time oil was at that level was in December 2003. 
 In the United States, retail gasoline prices, which had risen above $4 a gallon during the summer, have plummeted to $2.02 nationwide, according to AAA, the automotive group. Gasoline is selling for less than $2 a gallon in 23 states, including Michigan, Ohio and Nebraska.
 The drop-off in consumption has been particularly acute in the United States, the world's top oil consumer. 
 Gasoline demand, which accounts for more than half of the nation's oil use, fell sharply during the summer as higher prices forced Americans to scale back their driving. The cutback has persisted as broad economic anxiety has displaced worry about gasoline prices. 
 According to a weekly survey by MasterCard, gasoline consumption was down 2.8 percent last week compared with the same week a year earlier, its 30th consecutive weekly drop. 
 The Energy Department has estimated that domestic oil consumption this year will have its steepest drop since 1980, falling by more than 1.1 million barrels a day, or 5.4 percent. The government expects oil demand next year to fall by an additional 250,000 barrels a day, or 1.3 percent.
 ''Clearly the market does not need the oil because demand has collapsed,'' said Francisco Blanch, a commodity strategist at Merrill Lynch. 
 But the underlying factors that drove prices to their records in recent years have not really disappeared. 
 Many producing countries remain mired in trouble. Nigeria seems incapable of resolving a long-running insurgency in its main oil producing region that has forced oil production to be slashed by a third. 
 In Mexico, political squabbling between the governing party and the opposition has frozen efforts to open up the oil sector to foreign investments while the country's largest oil field is declining at an alarming rate. Oil production is also declining in Russia, Norway and Iran, for a variety of reasons.
 The speed with which companies are reacting to the difficulties is beginning to worry energy experts since it often takes a decade or more for oil fields to be developed and start production. Analysts at Morgan Stanley estimated that as of Nov. 5, 19 industry projects had been delayed or faced cutbacks; by Nov. 18, that had jumped to 44 projects.
 ''The risk is that 2009 cuts to investment plans increase these longer-term supply risks,'' the analysts said in a report.

While hanging from a lamppost, he watched Coach Lenny Wilkens ride by in a convertible. This, he thought to himself, is as good as it gets.
As bad as it gets is happening right now. Seattle sports are so bad, in fact, that if Sir Mix-A-Lot were to write a song about the scene, he said he would name it Purgatory. 
''Sports in this city are just terrible,'' he said. ''Has another city ever done this bad?''
Last weekend marked another low. The Mariners had yet to hire a new manager after their $118 million payroll bought one of the worst teams in baseball. (They hired Don Wakamatsu on Wednesday.) The University of Washington football team was trampled by U.C.L.A., a squad led by the former Washington coach Rick Neuheisel, who has now won more games in Seattle this season than the Huskies.
The Seahawks have likely ceded the National Football Conference West to the Arizona Cardinals, ending their run of four division championships. And the Sonics? They are playing under their new name, the Thunder, in their new home, Oklahoma City.
''This is the worst sports scene in the history of sports scenes,'' said Brian Robinson, a real-estate investor who co-founded the group Save our Sonics. ''There's no way to sugarcoat it.''
Memo to sports franchises across the country: Sir Mix-A-Lot is searching for teams to root for.
''I like the Redskins because Jim Zorn is their coach,'' Sir Mix-A-Lot said. ''If you stopped in Seattle and had a cup of coffee, I'll root for you. That's how desperate I am.''
Jeff Ament, the Pearl Jam bassist with a new solo album, recently traveled to Portland to watch his friend, Houston Rockets guard Brent Barry, play against the Trail Blazers. Lorin ''Big Lo'' Sandretzky, Seattle's super fan, is attending high school games in addition to professional ones.
Big Lo has gone through more than most. A former strip-club bouncer, he has been beaten and stabbed and watched three people die in his arms. He nearly died himself on three occasions during an emergency operation and won the lottery. In the last year, he had two additional emergency surgeries to remove abscesses in his leg, was told he had diabetes and lost 134 pounds, bringing his weight to 419.
Local sports have always brought memorabilia -- he has a glove signed by O. J. Simpson, and the shoes Nate McMillan wore in the N.B.A. finals -- and relief. Until now.
''I will stay positive,'' Big Lo vowed. ''Unfortunately, some years, cities have bad times. And unfortunately, this just happens to be the year we're being kicked around.''
On Sunday, the Seahawks rallied before losing to the Cardinals, 26-20. Big Lo slumped in the front row along with the rest of the die-hards in the south end zone.
After the last of the Seahawks left the field for the locker room, the stadium went silent. Seattle fans, as of that moment, had nothing left to cheer for.
Coach Mike Holmgren took a deep breath at the lectern. He never thought his final season with the Seahawks would end like this.
''You all saw the movie 'Groundhog Day,' '' he said. ''This feels like that a little bit.''
Only memories remain. Seattle's last major men's championship was the Sonics' in 1979, but the Mariners captivated the city with playoff runs in 1995 and 2001, the same year the Huskies played in the Rose Bowl. The Sonics went to the N.B.A. finals in 1996.
As recently as 2005, the Sonics were in the playoffs and the Seahawks were in the Super Bowl.
Now, when the Huskies and the Washington State Cougars meet in their rivalry game Saturday, some fans wanted to add the word rotten in front of the Apple Cup. The teams have combined for one win this season, and yet winless Washington is favored in the Someone Has to Win Bowl.
''It's like the Seattle sports scene is cursed,'' said Jim Marsh, a former Sonics player and broadcaster who coaches A.A.U. basketball in the area. ''Everything is coming up snake eyes.''
With Starbucks closing hundreds of stores across the country, what do folks in Seattle have left to root for?
Robinson, the Save our Sonics co-founder, remembered the time he spent in the Army bragging about and betting on Seattle sports. It became part of his identity, one he passed on to his two children.
While the Thunder played in Oklahoma City on Monday, Robinson planned to clean out his garage. The other day, his 5-year-old daughter said, in all seriousness: ''All our teams lose. When you were a little boy, did they win?'' Robinson said: ''We are at real risk of a whole generation of people not enjoying professional sports. It might dead-end. And I don't know what that could do to our sense of community.''
Worse yet, Edward McMichael, known locally as the Seattle sports fixture The Tuba Man, was murdered recently. More than 1,500 people attended his funeral, a reminder of what sports mean to cities.
When people ask Robinson why he fought so hard for the Sonics, he lists The Tuba Man among his reasons. The Tuba Man never made it into any civic brochures, Robinson said, ''but he was valuable to this community. And we miss him.''
They miss the Sonics, too.
Jill Arnow, the executive director of the Greater Queen Anne Chamber of Commerce, said area businesses were hurting because of the economy and because the Sonics left.
The Seattle Center, which houses KeyArena, recently lost the Seattle Thunderbirds minor league hockey team, but will host Seattle University basketball this season as the team moves to Division I.
Ament, who lived across the street from the center for 13 years and ranks it low among music venues but just fine for basketball, said, ''The future of Seattle Center is really grim right now.''
At KeyArena on Monday night, metal gates and garbage bins were stacked in neat rows outside the empty building. Eight ''for sale'' signs hung outside the Mainstage Comedy and Music Nightclub across the street. Skateboarders zoomed across the empty steps, as autumn leaves blew by instead of tumbleweeds.
When football season ends, Apolo Ohno, the gold medal-winning speedskater from Seattle, wondered ''What do we do now?'' Same with Walter Jones, the Seahawks' All-Pro left tackle and former Sonics season-ticket holder, who asked, ''What am I going to do on Monday nights?''
Inside of Floyd's Place, which is billed as Seattle's best sports bar, there came the sounds of sport -- cheering and clapping and imploring -- on Monday night. Even with the Thunder playing, though, the televisions were tuned to ''Monday Night Football,'' hockey and soccer.
Erik Denmark, an internationally ranked competitive eater, sat at the bar. He grew up watching Seattle sports and once attempted to eat 40 hot dogs when the Seahawks played in the 40th Super Bowl.
''Every week is a new low point,'' he said. ''It's pretty ridiculous and pretty comical. It's hard not to just laugh with cynical depression. Because everything happened so fast.''
James Donaldson, the former Sonics player, plans to run for Seattle City Council. He decided to run, in part, to bring another N.B.A. team to town. He speaks of the way the city mishandled the Sonics' leaving, of 41 years of history gone.
''The Sonics seem like they've been gone so long now,'' Donaldson said. ''N.B.A. basketball feels foreign and removed.''
But Hope remains. Big Lo, who missed five N.B.A. home games in 16 seasons, believes Seattle will get another franchise in the near future. The city also recently secured a Major League Soccer franchise; it already ranks among the league leaders in ticket sales. The Seattle Storm, which won the W.N.B.A. title in 2004, made the playoffs last season.
''It's just depressing,'' Denmark said. ''At some point, it just has to stop. To be so low, somehow we're owed something now.''
He laughed.
''At least we can dream, right?'' he said.

HEADLINE: Owners Say Downturn Won't Harm Stadium

BYLINE: By JOSHUA ROBINSON

DATELINE: EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. 

 BODY:
The new stadium for the Giants and the Jets is not quite gleaming yet. Its guts and bones are exposed to the elements as beams are shifted and concrete is poured. There is always something whirring, groaning or beeping.
 And as the new Meadowlands takes shape -- that same bowl shape of the old Meadowlands -- the men overseeing it are satisfied with its progress. On a hard-hat tour for the news media Thursday, the Jets' owner, Woody Johnson, and the Giants' president and co-owner, John Mara, proudly announced that the project was on budget and on schedule. This means that by opening day of the 2010 season, the teams will be playing in a $1.6 billion, 82,500-seat monument.
 The question of who will fill those seats seems less certain. Both teams unveiled personal seat license plans this past summer that would set fans back several thousand dollars for the privilege of renewing their season tickets. Add the deepening financial crisis, and it seems that many fans could be priced out of the new stadium. 
 But Johnson and Mara put a brave face on things Thursday, saying they were confident that their fans from the old Meadowlands would follow the teams across the parking lot.
 ''We haven't noticed it so far, but until the process is completed, it's pretty hard to determine one way or the other,'' Mara said of the economic slowdown's effect. ''I don't expect it to have a big impact on the sales.''
 Johnson was more forceful, insisting that fans were taking the long view.
 ''We are in a situation economically that we're reading about every day,'' he said. ''There are serious problems. However, people who are purchasing these are looking over this. This country is going to get back on its feet again.''
 The Giants announced their new ticket plan before the Jets, putting a price tag of $1,000 to $20,000 on every seat license in the stadium, with a cluster of 2,113 elite seats behind the bench called the Coaches Club fetching the most money. 
 The Jets chose to exempt the 27,000 seats in the stadium's upper bowl from seat licenses, and to auction 2,028 Coaches Club seats instead of selling them directly. The auction was held in October on StubHub.com; the Jets sold 620 seat licenses for a gross revenue of $16 million. 
 Mara said he originally expected the plan to generate a strong reaction among fans, but reported that it had been less intense than anticipated. The economic strain the plan puts on fans, however, has been of concern. 
 ''That's why we tried to come up with as many different pricing options as possible,'' Mara said, ''and we're trying to be flexible and work with people in terms of the payment schedule.'' 
 If someone informs the Giants that they can no longer afford their season ticket, Mara said, the club will contact that person by phone or by mail to make sure they are fully aware of the available pricing options, including a range of financing packages.
 The Jets, meanwhile, have their own financing plans laid out for fans who purchase licenses costing $10,000 to $50,000 each. Fans can spread the payment out over 5 to 15 years, with interest rates of 6.5 percent to 8 percent.
 ''I think at the end of the day, we're going to be successful in keeping just about everybody in the new building,'' Mara said.
 With big business suffering as much as consumers in the current economic climate, it seemed that the corporate luxury suites both teams have invested so much in could also be at risk. But Johnson and Mara were quick to dispel those worries. Mara said they were already ahead of expectations, having sold about 60 percent of them.
 ''We're pretty confident that we'll be sold out by the time we open the 2010 football season,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Teenagers' Violent 'Sport' Led to Killing, Officials Say

BYLINE: By CARA BUCKLEY

DATELINE: RIVERHEAD, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Every now and then, perhaps once a week, seven young friends got together in their hamlet of Medford, on eastern Long Island, to hunt down, and hurt, Hispanic men. They made a sport of it, calling their victims ''beaners,'' a reference to the staple Hispanic dish of rice and beans, prosecutors said on Thursday. 
 Nov. 8 was a particularly long and violent day, the prosecutors said. Two of the teenagers set out in their car at dawn and one of them fired a BB gun at a Hispanic man in his driveway, striking him several times. That evening, the group, now seven strong, drank beer in a park and searched for more victims. They found and beat a Hispanic man in neighboring Patchogue, but he was able to escape. 
 Then, shortly before midnight, prosecutors said, they caught sight of Marcelo Lucero, an Ecuadorean immigrant walking with a friend near the train station in Patchogue. The teenagers surrounded, taunted and beat Mr. Lucero, who tried to fight back. One of the youths fatally stabbed Mr. Lucero, 37, a worker at a dry cleaning store and 16-year resident of the United States who regularly sent money to his ailing mother in Ecuador.
 Six of the seven teenagers, now defendants charged with multiple counts of gang assault and hate crimes, were arraigned Thursday in Suffolk County Criminal Court. 
 ''To them, it was a sport,'' Thomas J. Spota, Suffolk County's district attorney, said in a news conference after the defendants were arraigned. ''We know for sure that there are more victims out there.'' 
 Moments earlier, one by one, the youths were led before a courtroom packed with their parents and high school friends, as well as Mr. Lucero's relatives, many of whom wept as the prosecution detailed the chilling sequence of events. 
 A grand jury indictment, also unsealed on Thursday, laid out additional charges that the defendants now face for what prosecutors described as earlier crimes against Hispanics.
 A seventh defendant, Jeffrey Conroy, 17, a star high school athlete, was charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter as a hate crime in Mr. Lucero's death. He is scheduled to be arraigned on Monday. 
 The judge set bail for five of the youths at $250,000 cash or $500,000 bond, and bail was denied to a sixth defendant, Christopher Overton, 16, who has a felony conviction for a 2007 burglary in which an East Patchogue man was killed.
 All seven defendants have pleaded not guilty in the attack on Mr. Lucero.
 In the courtroom, at a news conference and in the indictment itself, the prosecutors detailed the following chronology of events that preceded Mr. Lucero's death. 
 Mr. Spota said three defendants, Anthony Hartford, Kevin Shea and Jose Pacheco, all 17, went out driving five days before Mr. Lucero was killed with the intent of, in their words, ''beaner hopping.'' 
 They found a Hispanic man that day whom Mr. Pacheco admitted to punching and knocking out cold, Mr. Spota said. That victim has not stepped forward. Mr. Pacheco later told the police, ''I don't go out and do this very often, maybe once a week,'' Mr. Spota said.
 About 5 a.m. on Nov. 8, Nicholas Hausch and Jordan Dasch, both 17, fired a BB gun at Marlon Garcia, hitting him several times. In the evening, the seven friends got together and, after failing to find potential victims in Medford, set off for Patchogue, where they saw Hector Sierra walking downtown. They caught up to him and punched him before he ran away. 
 Shortly before midnight, the teens saw Mr. Lucero and his friend, Angel Loja. They got out of their car and taunted the men with racist slurs. Mr. Loja fled, but the group surrounded Mr. Lucero and punched him in the face. Trying to defend himself, Mr. Lucero removed his belt and swung it, striking Mr. Conroy in the head. Enraged, Mr. Conroy rushed at Mr. Lucero and plunged a knife into his chest. The youths fled, but were soon caught by the police. 
 Mr. Conroy was the only one charged with murder, Mr. Spota said, because the other six defendants were initially unaware that he had stabbed Mr. Lucero. 
 Lawyers for the six defendants arraigned on Thursday argued that their clients were being unfairly charged with crimes committed by others in the group. They also said that the defendants were not racist and pointed to the young men's friends, black, white and Hispanic, filling the courtroom seats.
 Chris Kirby, the lawyer for Mr. Pacheco, said in court that his client was of Hispanic descent and therefore incapable of a racist attack. ''The idea that he, of Hispanic heritage, would beat up another Hispanic is patently absurd,'' Mr. Kirby said.
 Mr. Lucero's killing has brought to the fore a fierce debate about race relations in Patchogue, a comfortable village of 11,700. Latinos make up a quarter of the population, according to the 2000 census. With the numbers of Latinos in the county growing and the economy weakening , some residents say there is a deepening resentment toward illegal immigrants, particularly day laborers. 
 County officials have insisted the attack was not connected to any simmering racial tensions in Patchogue or Medford. County Executive Steve Levy, long a proponent of crackdowns on illegal immigrants, called the defendants ''white supremacists.'' Michael Mostow, the superintendent of Patchogue-Medford School District, said there was no racial strife at the high school the teenagers attended and described the attack as ''an aberration.'' 
 The killing of Mr. Lucero yielded an outpouring of outrage and grief that rippled beyond the tightly knit Hispanic community here. His body was flown this week to his hometown, the mountain city of Gualaceo, Ecuador, and mourners by the hundreds met his coffin, Newsday reported
 At a news conference after the arraignments, Hispanic leaders and members of Mr. Lucero's family said they were pleased with the upgraded charges. At first, the defendants were accused of fewer crimes, and Mr. Conroy faced a charge of manslaughter, but not murder. 
 Cesar Perales, president and general counsel of the advocacy group Latino Justice P.R.L.D.E.F. said the new charges were important in restoring Hispanics' faith in the county's justice system.
 Fernando Mateo, a spokesman for the Lucero family, said that while he was pleased that ''justice would be served,'' he did not believe recent reports that hate crimes had plummeted in the county in the last few years. ''Hunting season is over for this group now,'' Mr. Mateo said, as Mr. Lucero's brother, Joselo, stood silently by his side. ''It was a hobby to them, I know it started out as a game, but it turned into a murder.''

HEADLINE: Summer in Beijing Was Strong for Sports, But Weak for Ads

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
WHAT happened to the ''Beijing bounce''? It was the surge in advertising spending that the Summer Olympics were supposed to provide.
 ''Going into this, we expected a substantial spike,'' said Martin Sorrell, the chief executive of the WPP Group, the world's second-largest advertising company, after the Omnicom Group. ''That spike didn't materialize.''
 Mr. Sorrell said the shortfall in what WPP had billed as the Beijing bounce was global, despite strong television ratings for the Games in vital markets like the United States. 
 But the biggest disappointment may have been in China itself. There, ad spending raced ahead at an annual rate of 19 percent during the first seven months of the year, according to Nielsen, the research company. Ad executives hoped that spending would accelerate further in August, when the Games took place. Instead, the increase slowed to 7 percent, Nielsen said.
 A 7 percent gain might sound great to ad executives in the United States or Western Europe, where spending is flat or falling in many places. But in China, a 7 percent increase is exceptionally weak. The only time this year that growth has been similarly subdued was May, when the government imposed restrictions on advertising after the Sichuan earthquake.
 Usually, ad spending surges in host countries during the Olympics as marketers try to ride a wave of good will about the Games to get their messages in front of consumers. During the previous three Summer Olympics -- in Athens, Sydney and Atlanta -- ad spending in their countries increased to roughly double the average monthly rate, Nielsen said.
 Oddly, the slump during the Beijing Games does not seem to have been caused by the global economic slump, ad executives said. Instead, Beijing may have been beaten by its own hype, said Richard Basil-Jones, managing director for the Asia-Pacific media division at Nielsen.
 Olympic sponsors, which spent hundreds of millions of dollars for the right to link themselves to the Games, spent an additional $370 million on advertising in August in China, Nielsen said. That was 40 percent more than they spent a year earlier.
 But brands that were not officially affiliated with the Games reduced their spending sharply.
 ''There were a lot of categories that just literally turned the tap off,'' Mr. Basil-Jones said, adding that spending in areas like health care and toiletries was particularly weak.
 That is unusual. Typically nonsponsors rise to the challenge, trying to keep pace with their competitors. When Coca-Cola sponsors the Games, for example, Pepsi usually spends heavily, too, even if it is not permitted to put the Olympic logo on its products.
 This time, the authorities went to considerable lengths to protect sponsors from so-called ambush marketing, in which sponsors' rivals try to get a free ride by passing themselves off as supporters of the Games. The Olympic organizers removed many billboards around sites of the Games, for example, and insisted that others were to be made available only to sponsors.
 Other marketers may have been worried about wasting their money.
 ''A lot of advertisers that weren't going to take a major role in this, they probably decided this was a good time to hold back,'' Mr. Basil-Jones said.
 Now ad executives are trying to determine whether softness will persist in China, which has been the main engine of growth in global ad spending this year.
 Andrew Meaden, chief executive of the North Asian operations of MindShare, a media buying agency owned by WPP, said that although his company's clients, including Olympic sponsors, actually spent heavily during the Games, there were signs of a slowdown since then. 
 MindShare has reduced slightly its forecast for growth next year in ad spending on television, which makes up the majority of the Chinese advertising market. It will grow 11 percent in 2009, Mr. Meaden said, after 16 percent growth this year.
 ''Lots of multinational clients that we've talked to over the last few weeks are going over the numbers quite hard,'' he said. ''That said, there's still a strong desire to win in China, so I don't think they will give up easily.''

 AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'THE SEDUCTION OF LIGHT,' through March 29. Comparisons may be invidious, but they can also be illuminating. Consider this small, tightly focused exhibition of portraits by the 19th-century American folk artist Ammi Phillips and paintings by the 20th-century Abstract Expressionist Mark Rothko. The presentation reveals parallel ways of dealing with surface, color and light. It also reveals two painters who were, each in his own pragmatic yet metaphysically resonant way, distinctly American artists. 45 West 53rd Street, (212) 265-1040, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
 ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'ART AND CHINA'S REVOLUTION,' through Jan. 11. The splashy party that was the 2008 Olympics is yesterday's news, but one-party rule in China remains. New China is still, in significant ways, Old China. The obvious question is: What comes next? To help answer it, Asia Society asks a different, equally timely post-Olympics question: What came before? This exhibition of paintings, drawings, posters and Maoist souvenirs produced in the years leading up to and during the Cultural Revolution gives complicated answers. It lays out the conflicted loyalties that have shaped contemporary China, and finds them in the work of artists who anticipated the current art boom and are part of it. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. (Holland Cotter)
 * ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'TRACES OF THE CALLIGRAPHER: ISLAMIC CALLIGRAPHY IN PRACTICE, CIRCA 1600-1900' AND 'WRITING THE WORD OF GOD: CALLIGRAPHY AND THE QUR'AN,' through Feb. 8. These side-by-side exhibitions, perfect in size and carefully thought out, approach Islamic calligraphy from two perspectives. The first show is basically a manual in techniques of fine penmanship and luxury book-making, illustrated by superb examples of tools of the trade and finished products. The second is an array of hand-written Koran pages for total-immersion contemplation. Gorgeous. (See above.) (Cotter)
 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'STREET ART STREET LIFE: FROM THE 1950S TO NOW,' through Jan. 25. If to you ''street life'' means noise-lights-action, you'll find this show a surprise. With its immaculate, stripped-down installation, the exhibition is clearly devoted not to recreating the feel of art on the street, but to recording it, from Robert Frank's unvarnished photographic views of post-World War II America to digital montages by Fatimah Tuggar uniting today's streets of New York and Lagos, Nigeria. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GILBERT & GEORGE,' through Jan. 11. Dynamic duo, gruesome twosome or just plain geeks in ties and tweeds, the British artists Gilbert & George don't seem to care what you call them as long as you pay attention, which you couldn't avoid doing if you tried in their suffocating and disordered wraparound survey at the Brooklyn Museum. In no particular sequence, we see the shadowy early black-and-white photographic pieces they did while living in a falling-down section of London in the 1970s, and the huge Pop colored murals filled with flowers and crowds of dishy young men, which decrease in number during the most devastating years of the AIDS epidemic. The newest work in the show, from 2005 and 2006, is crazy, end-of-time stuff. Terrorism and religious fundamentalism are the themes, and Gilbert and George themselves, partners in art as in life, are in the picture, mugging, moralizing, unembarrassed and all but unendurable, in art that's right for right now. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'JESPER JUST: ROMANTIC DELUSIONS,' through Jan. 4. An enchanting show of four short films exhibits most of the qualities for which Mr. Just has become known since completing his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 2003. Melodramatic but never campy or over the top and made with Hollywood-quality production values, his brief musicals explore vulnerable, ordinarily well-armored zones of the masculine psyche, like grief, same-sex love, Oedipal conflict and spiritual desire. The singing is wonderful. (See above.) (Ken Johnson)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HOUSE PROUD: 19TH-CENTURY WATERCOLOR INTERIORS FROM THE THAW COLLECTION,' through Jan. 25. The 70 or so jewel-like renderings of rooms and their furnishings here are delightful, mordantly signifying artifacts. They track the domestic effects of exoticism and nostalgia (chinoiserie, Gothic Revival); uncover glimmers of modernity (Biedermeier, smaller rooms); and witness the birth of the contemporary genre known as shelter porn. Accompanied by relevant examples of furniture, decorative objects and books, they also reveal that rooms seen whole, with light and space as well as decor carefully depicted, are among painting's most appealing subjects. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. 
 (Roberta Smith)
 * FRICK COLLECTION: 'ANDREA RICCIO: RENAISSANCE MASTER OF BRONZE,' through Jan. 18. Scholars say that Andrea Riccio was one of the greatest sculptors of the Italian Renaissance. Cast in dark bronze and resembling Roman antiquities, Riccio's small-scale statuettes, reliefs and oil lamps seem unremarkably modest at first. But let your eyes adjust to the formal subtlety, expressive urgency and almost supernatural aliveness of his art and you will fall in love. Sculpture does not get much better than this. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Ken Johnson)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM:
 'THEANYSPACEWHATEVER,' through Jan. 7. The innately sculptural Guggenheim mounts the first major exhibition in this country about relational aesthetics -- probably the most radical art to emerge in the 1990s -- and comes up looking, well, remarkably empty, which is also extraordinarily beautiful in its own Wright. The more or less interactive works by 10 artists invite you to experience in a new way time, space, the art-viewing world and the museum itself. Even if you never want to see the museum going this far out again, the Guggenheim must be credited for bringing the latest art remarkably intact to a larger public. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Roberta Smith) 
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CATHERINE OPIE: AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHER,' through Jan. 7. Catherine Opie is many artists in one. Best known in the 1990s for her striking portraits of gay, lesbian and transgendered men and women drawn from a circle of friends and intimates, she is also a photographer of landscapes, cityscapes, architecture, still lifes and lifestyles. She is an insider and an outsider: a documentarian and a provocateur, a classicist and a maverick; a trekker and a stay-at-home; a lesbian feminist mother who resists the gay mainstream. It's all here in a fine retrospective. (See above.) (Cotter) 
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AMERICA AND THE TINTYPE,' through Jan. 4. This show about the tintype, an early form of photograph made by exposing a lacquered iron plate to light, includes some 200 examples from the museum's collection. Most of the artists, and subjects, are unidentified. These works form a group portrait of Americans, mostly working- and middle-class, struggling to adapt to the rapidly shifting social and economic conditions during the four decades after the Civil War. The exhibition makes the most of the tintype's range of subject matter and emotion, from postmortem shots to vaudevillian caricatures, freedmen to minstrels. It does not dispute the daguerreotype's superior potentials for artistry but simply asserts that tintypes have been unfairly overlooked because of their ubiquity, affordability and anonymity. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'SUSAN MEISELAS: IN HISTORY,' through Jan. 4. A certain moral quandary runs throughout this fascinatingly problematic exhibition: how do you reconcile the demands of professionalism and those of human compassion? To her credit, Ms. Meiselas -- whose coverage of the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua in 1978-79 made her one of the world's most celebrated and criticized war correspondents -- does not duck the question. Tension between opportunism and conscience emerges as the show's main interest -- to the point that it trumps its ostensible subjects, which include strippers in traveling carnivals and forensic investigations of Saddam Hussein's campaign against the Kurds in northern Iraq. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE JEWISH MUSEUM: 'CHAGALL AND THE ARTISTS OF THE RUSSIAN JEWISH THEATER, 1919-1949,' through March 22. A fascinating tale of two vanguard theater companies that flourished in Moscow for a few years after the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 is told by this big, walk-in scrapbook of a show presenting more than 200 pieces of art and ephemera. Exploring the histories of the Hebrew-speaking Habima theater and the Yiddish-speaking Moscow State Yiddish Theater, the exhibition includes drawings, paintings, photographs, posters, sheet music, costumes and clips from vintage films. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE ESSENTIAL ART OF AFRICAN TEXTILES,' through March 22. This show presents 19th-century African textiles, many lent by the British Museum, alongside relevant contemporary artworks from the Met's collection. One of the most spectacular pairings matches El Anatsui's ''Between Earth and Heaven,'' a recent acquisition, with a kente prestige cloth from Ghana. The Met's 2005 exhibition ''Matisse: The Fabric of Dreams'' hinted that textiles had been undervalued in the Western canon; while the current show may not have the same blockbuster appeal, it goes deeper into the techniques and traditions that make the fabrics so striking and seductive. A related show, ''The Poetics of Cloth: African Textiles/Recent Art,'' is at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
 THE MET: 'EARLY BUDDHIST MANUSCRIPT PAINTING: THE PALM-LEAF TRADITION,' through March 22. Practical features like resilience and portability help explain why books written on dried palm leaves were popular with Buddhists in eastern India between the 10th and 13th centuries. But another factor, surely, was the quality of the illustrations that accompanied the texts: exquisite figures of divinities or scenes from the Buddha's life. And few of these are as finely done and pristinely preserved as the examples in this small selection. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'GIORGIO MORANDI, 1890-1964,' through Dec. 14. Aspirants to the role of painter as poet are many. Giorgio Morandi (1890-1964) was the real thing. And this Morandi retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is something that anyone who loves painting and its very specific poetry will want to see. Morandi's still lifes are beautiful, but with a distinctive kind of beauty. And despite their small size and plain components -- bottles, jars, boxes, pots, seashells, vases -- they are emotionally audacious. This isn't because of what they say outright, but because of what they don't say; because they are so evidently shaped by self-restraint, and the passions that produced it. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)
 THE MET: 'LANDSCAPES CLEAR AND RADIANT: THE ART OF WANG HUI (1632-1717),' through Jan. 4. The Met's first solo show devoted to a Chinese master is gorgeous and revelatory; its focus is the landscape virtuoso Wang Hui, star of the 17th-century Chinese art scene. Wang could do anything and did, synthesizing and transforming disparate strands of almost a millennium of Chinese painting, but also making exact copies of earlier masterpieces. Distinguished by a Mozart-like ease and perfection, his work unsettles Western notions of copy, original and originality. It is aided in this by displays of works by 16 earlier artists dating to the 10th-century -- his mentors, his mentors' mentors and the artists they all revered -- which form a dazzling introduction to Chinese painting in general. (See above.) (Smith)
 THE MET: 'THE PHILIPPE DE MONTEBELLO YEARS: CURATORS CELEBRATE THREE DECADES OF ACQUISITIONS,' through Feb. 1. As the title implies, the show is a tribute to Mr. de Montebello, who is leaving the Met after being director for more than 30 years. For the occasion, curators in 17 of the museum departments have chosen objects in their fields of expertise from the permanent collection. There are marvelous things here, from Chinese scrolls, Greek vessels and Oceanic effigies to Byzantine icons and an 18th-century American pickle-holder. In short, a wonder-cabinet situation. (See above.) (Cotter)
 THE MET: 'RHYTHMS OF MODERN LIFE: BRITISH PRINTS 1914-1939,' through Dec. 7. This interesting but confusingly organized exhibition considers the impact of modernity and machine-age idealism on 13 progressive British printmakers. Much of the show is given over to a group of artists active in the 1920s and '30s -- including Claude Flight, Cyril E. Power and Sybil Andrews -- who created colorful linocuts in a lively synthesis of Cubism, Futurism and Art Deco. (See above.) (Johnson)THE MET: 'TIBETAN ARMS AND ARMOR FROM THE PERMANENT COLLECTION,' through fall 2009. The paradox of militant Buddhism inspired the Metropolitan's fascinating 2006 exhibition ''Warriors of the Himalayas: Rediscovering the Arms and Armor of Tibet.'' Now Donald LaRocca, the museum's arms and armor curator, has created a follow-up installation of 35 objects from the Met's collection (including 5 acquired in 2007). This time the focus is on defense rather than offense: examples of horse and body armor, dating from the 15th through the 20th centuries, outnumber swords, guns and spears. Most of these objects have seen more ceremonial than military action. All of them equate supreme craftsmanship with defense of the body and Buddhist principles. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MORGAN LIBRARY & MUSEUM: JOHN MILTON'S 'PARADISE LOST,' through Jan. 4. To honor Milton's quadricentennial, eight of the pages of the only known surviving manuscript of Book 1 of ''Paradise Lost'' are on view, along with other Miltoniana, including a first edition and a miniature portrait believed to be of the poet. The handwriting is a scribe's; Milton, who was blind, composed the work orally. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org.
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'SECOND LIVES: REMIXING THE ORDINARY,' through Feb. 15. The inaugural show in the Museum of Arts and Design's jewel-box-like building continues its haphazard segue from a concentration on craft to a hipper, more wide-ranging program. Unfortunately, the focus is a strategy that is epidemic in the larger art world: the massing of something small (plastic spoons, ladies pumps, spools of thread, dangling eyeglasses) into something large (a pyramid, a loveseat, a view of the ''Mona Lisa,'' a chandelier). It is Surrealism 101, descended from Meret Oppenheim's beloved and far too influential fur-lined teacup. Basically, you see the thing. You see the things it is made of. Something in the way of a punch line follows. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'PARIS/NEW YORK: DESIGN FASHION CULTURE, 1925-1940,' through Feb. 22. This compact yet kaleidoscopic exhibition celebrates the romance that flourished between New York and Paris in the 1920s and '30s, when French Art Deco was the style, American jazz was the music, and skyscrapers and sumptuous ocean liners were among the symbols of the age. Selected and installed to extract maximum wattage from every juxtaposition, object and image (including many surprisingly effective digital reproductions), it tracks the exchange of goods as much as of ideas, and the roles played by both department stores and museums, knock-offs and originals, businessmen (especially developers) and designers and artists. Most memorably, it clarifies a golden age of design and building, when New York became the world capital of Art Deco architecture. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Smith)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'JOAN MIRO: PAINTING AND ANTI-PAINTING 1927-1937,' through Jan. 12. When, in 1927, Joan Miro said, ''I want to assassinate painting,'' he wasn't saying anything new. What was new was the way he carried out his self-assigned, cut-throat task. And that process is the subject of this invigorating, absorbing and -- Miro would be mortified -- beautiful show. It illustrates, step by step, how he stalked and attacked painting -- zapped its conventions, messed up its history, spoiled its market value -- through distinctive groups of experimental works produced over a decade. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'LOOKING AT MUSIC,' through Jan. 5. This exhibition of about 40 works from the museum's collection emphasizes the experimental nature of both art and music in the late 1960s and early '70s. The lines dividing art, music and film were blurry enough to allow Laurie Anderson, Bruce Nauman and Yoko Ono, among others, to shift from object making to performance and back again. The show, which includes audio recordings and small-press publications alongside more conventional mediums, is accompanied by an extensive film and video program. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'NEW PHOTOGRAPHY 2008: JOSEPHINE MECKSEPER AND MIKHAEL SUBOTZKY,' through Jan. 5. Josephine Meckseper, a German-born artist in her 40s who was trained at the California Institute of the Arts, makes sleek-looking installations that mix photography and film -- often scenes of political protest -- with consumer objects. The South African artist Mikhael Subotzky, who at 26 is the youngest photographer to have been invited to join the Magnum Group, explores his country's prison system in vivid color and unflinching detail. If Ms. Meckseper finds glossy, consumerist fantasy infiltrating our political consciousness, Mr. Subotzky reminds us that some people don't yet have the luxury of fretting about the commodification of dissent. (See above.) (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'VAN GOGH AND THE COLORS OF THE NIGHT,' through Jan. 5. This small, anomalous exhibition is a Van Gogh antiblockbuster with a seemingly counterintuitive theme, given the importance of the brilliant light of southern France to his art. It explores Van Gogh's special relationship with darkness, where his interests in perception, color and symbolism fuse with unexpected intensity. And seeing a manageable number of Van Goghs -- including masterpieces like ''The Potato Eaters,'' ''The Starry Night'' and ''Night Cafe'' -- in intimate galleries is thrilling. (See above.) (Smith)
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'GEORGE TOOKER: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through Jan. 4. George Tooker has painted some of the 20th century's most memorable images of angst. With its lost souls haunting the New York underground, ''Subway'' (1950) envisions modernity as a spiritual prison system. The Kafkaesque ''Government Bureau'' (1956) pictures an office of seemingly infinite dimensions, where people wait like penitents at the windows of terminally unresponsive bureaucrats. Both paintings are included in this richly affecting five-decade career retrospective. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Johnson)
 NEUE GALERIE: 'ALFRED KUBIN: DRAWINGS, 1897-1909,' through Jan. 26. You would never guess that the Viennese artist Alfred Kubin was a contemporary of Gustav Klimt; he is closer in spirit to the Belgian James Ensor and the Norwegian Edvard Munch, visionaries who expressed modernity's spiritual toll and anticipated some of the horrors of the 20th century. Executed in black-and-white pen, ink and spray on heavy paper used for cartography, Kubin's drawings map the shadowy corners of the unconscious. Playing to the art's dark themes, the Neue Galerie's third floor has been made over in the sensationally macabre style of a Tim Burton movie. The walls are painted black and brown; red crushed-velvet curtains hang in the doorways; and Kubin's death mask is displayed in a coffinlike glass case. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Rosenberg)
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'LIVE FOREVER: ELIZABETH PEYTON,' through Jan. 11. This lush midcareer survey pays tribute to an artist whose diminutive, irony-free, boldly colored portraits of friends, artists, rock stars and other historic figures, living and dead, have exerted considerable influence over the last 16 years. The reason is a complex, highly effective fusion of the painterly, the personal and the Conceptual, as well as a kind of reverse appropriation, wherein photographs and snapshots are given a new permanence, substance and most of all feeling by being re-engineered into unique art objects. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
 THE NEW MUSEUM: 'MARY HEILMANN: TO BE SOMEONE,' through Jan. 26. Over the past four decades Ms. Heilmann has been painting with an infectious, unabashedly hedonistic joie de vivre. Working with big brushes and generous quantities of paint, she continues to produce wildly colorful abstractions that riff with irreverent verve on basic elements of Modernist painting: the grid, the monochromatic rectangle, stripes, organic forms, linear webs, spots, checks and drips. This exhilarating retrospective presents works dating from 1967 to the present. (See above.) (Johnson)
 P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'LEANDRO ERLICH: SWIMMING POOL,' through April 13. From P.S. 1's first-floor hallway you step onto a wooden deck that surrounds a small, fully equipped swimming pool. Glowing lights built into the aqua walls light up watery depths below the gently churning surface. A flight of stairs leads to a lower level and a magical surprise. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
 SCHOMBURG CENTER FOR RESEARCH IN BLACK CULTURE: 'AARON DOUGLAS: AFRICAN-AMERICAN MODERNIST,' through Nov. 30. In 1920s New York a great flowering of black culture emerged that came to be known as the Harlem Renaissance. No visual artist expressed that movement's euphoric sense of possibility with greater verve than the subject of this valuable exhibition, the painter, illustrator and muralist Aaron Douglas. His major works feature semitransparent silhouettes of black people in heroic poses overlaid by concentric, circular bands of light. Rendered in muted, luminous colors, they project visionary romanticism in a suave, Art Deco-like style. 515 Malcolm X Boulevard, at 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2200, nypl.org/research/sc. (Johnson)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'ALEXANDER CALDER: THE PARIS YEARS, 1926-1933,' through Feb. 15. Is art glorified child's play, extending into adulthood, through a lifetime, picking up ideas and gaining finesse as it goes? That's one way to think of this exhibition, which focuses intently on one artist's child-within embodied in toys, cartoons and wire figures, with the Whitney's famous ''Calder's Circus'' as a centerpiece and a grown-up modernist surprise at the end. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
 WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'WILLIAM EGGLESTON: DEMOCRATIC CAMERA,' through Jan. 25. When William Eggleston's color, snapshot-like photographs of his home territory in the American South were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in 1976, critics squawked that the work was vulgar and haphazard. But these pictures quickly became influential classics. And that's how they look in this 40-year retrospective at the Whitney, the artist's first New York museum solo since his seditious debut. The show includes a recently edited version of Mr. Eggleston's cruel, unusual and ultimately revolting video epic ''Stranded in Canton.'' (See above.) (Cotter)
 Galleries: Uptown
 'FRANKENTHALER AT EIGHTY: SIX DECADES'Helen Frankenthaler's longtime gallery is throwing her an 80th-birthday party. With nine large-scale works from the artist's personal collection, covering more than five decades, the show takes the form of a mini-retrospective. (A more substantial museum survey is long overdue.) The earliest work is ''Western Dream,'' a maelstrom of lavender-and-coral stains on unprimed canvas; the newest is ''Warming Trend,'' a near-monochrome field of indigo with fiery undertones. Knoedler & Company, 19 East 70th Street, (212) 794-0550, knoedlergallery.com, through Jan. 10. (Rosenberg)
 'ISABEL AND OTHER INTIMATE STRANGERS: PORTRAITS BY ALBERTO GIACOMETTI AND FRANCIS BACON' The artist-muse relationship inspires a museum-quality exhibition, inaugurating Gagosian's new fourth-floor exhibition space. The woman singled out in the title is the model Isabel Rawsthorne, whose chiseled cheekbones inspired several paintings by Bacon and sculptures by Giacometti. Other captivating figures in the exhibition include Lucian Freud, in Bacon's portraits, and Giacometti's wife and mistress (in separate, and markedly different, paintings). The show was organized by Veronique Wiesinger, the director of the Giacometti Foundation in Paris, and Martin Harrison, who is overseeing Bacon's catalogue raisonne. Gagosian, 980 Madison Avenue, near 77th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com, through Dec. 13. (Rosenberg)
 LIZA LOU It's no coincidence that Liza Lou's first New York appearance since a 2002 solo in SoHo takes place in an uptown town house and a Park Avenue lobby. Ms. Lou, a sculptor who makes hand-beaded versions of everyday objects and environments, has shifted from immersive installations (like the ''Kitchen'' and ''Back Yard'' exhibited at the New Museum in the mid-'90s) to highly marketable sculptures and relief paintings. The transition isn't all bad. Ms. Lou's beadwork is still dazzling, and she is certainly experimenting with different genres. The showstopper is ''Security Fence'' (2005-7), a shimmering 10-foot-square enclosure of barbed wire and chain-link steel completely covered with silver beads. (A similar sculpture, ''Maximum Security Fence,'' is on view in the lobby of Lever House, 390 Park Avenue, at 54th Street, through Nov. 29.) L & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com, through Dec. 13. (Rosenberg)
 'PICASSO'S MARIE-THEReSE' In 2006 Steve Wynn, of Las Vegas casino fame, was set to sell ''The Dream,'' a Picasso he owned, for the record price of $139 million. Then one day, while showing the collection to friends, he put his elbow through the painting. The sale was off; the picture was patched. Now it's the centerpiece of a gallery show with several other paintings of Marie-Therese Walter, Picasso's lover, with most of them on loan from museums. Close inspection reveals no visible trace of the elbow malfunction in Mr. Wynn's picture, though it does reaffirm Picasso's penchant for producing kitsch. Acquavella Galleries, 18 East 79th Street, (212) 734-6300, acquavellagalleries.com, through Nov. 29. (Cotter)
 Galleries: SoHo
 ROBERT CUMMING: 'RECOLETA' An exceptionally inventive painter, sculptor and photographer, Mr. Cumming has hand-cut a series of intricate, faux-Victorian silhouette pictures from sheets of black paper. Packed with eccentric storytelling and intriguing symbolism, they were inspired by a visit to La Recoleta, a vast cemetery in Buenos Aires. Janet Borden, 560 Broadway, at West Houston Street, (212) 431-0166, janetbordeninc.com, through Dec. 13. (Johnson)
 TESSA FARMER This imaginative British sculptor has created a hideous race of ant-size ''fairies'': teeny, black humanoid skeletons equipped with insect wings. She has documented their activities, which include hunting, killing and eating bugs much bigger than themselves, in riveting stop-action videos. You also will find them populating sculptures revolving around a mummified dog, a stuffed crow and a dead mouse. Spencer Brownstone Gallery, 39 Wooster Street, (212) 334-3455, spencerbrownstonegallery.com, through Dec. 13. (Johnson)
 CHARLOTTE POSENENSKE: 'PROTOTYPES FOR MASS PRODUCTION (1965-1967)' The works in this exhibition -- simple geometric forms made of folded sheet metal and painted in black and primary-colored enamels -- were intended to be mass-produced, sold at cost and displayed in public. Ms. Posenenske quit making art in 1968 when she concluded that it could not make enough of a political difference in the world, but her sculptures still have a bright, Pop Art-like punch. Peter Freeman, 560 Broadway, at Prince Street, (212) 966-5154, peterfreemaninc.com, through Jan. 10. (Johnson)
 KEHINDE WILEY: 'DOWN' Mr. Wiley is known for paintings of young African-American men dressed in fashionable street wear posing against richly patterned backgrounds like heroic figures in Renaissance paintings. This exhibition presents eight enormous paintings of young men in reclining positions. The biggest, called ''Sleep,'' which measures 11 by 25 feet, depicts a muscular man lying back like the dead Jesus, naked but for a snowy white cloth swaddling his hips. Deitch Projects, 18 Wooster Street, (212) 343-7300, deitch.com, through Dec. 20. (Johnson)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 CHARLES GAINES: 'MANIFESTOS' The politically charged texts scrolling up flat-screen monitors in this poetically resonant and conceptually intriguing exhibition are manifestos from movements like the Black Panthers and the Zapatistas. The minor-key music that accompanies them -- composed using a John Cage-like system of chance and played by a piano quintet -- is beautiful and soothing. Kent, 541 West 25th Street, (212) 627-3680, kentgallery.com, through Dec. 20. (Johnson)
 Galleries: Other
 ERNST CARAMELLE: 'DOUBLE VISION' Mr. Caramelle partly covers sheets of ordinary colored construction paper with straight-edged pieces of paper, bleaches them in the sun and then removes the masking elements. The resulting geometric compositions have a beguiling luminosity. Tracy Williams Ltd., 313 West Fourth Street, West Village, (212) 229-2757, tracywilliamsltd.com, through Dec. 23. (Johnson)
 'LOOKING BACK' This annual assessment of the previous year in New York art includes a scary sound installation by Paul McCarthy; a pair of funky wooden sculptures of pianos by the playwright Richard Foreman; a sculpture of a white cube with eccentric additions, by Liz Craft; and a satiric videotaped conversation from 1977 between the critic Gregory Battcock and Marcia Tucker, the founding director of the New Museum. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street (entrance on Horatio Street), West Village, (212) 924-4212, whitecolumns.org, through Dec. 13. (Johnson)
 NASREEN MOHAMEDI: 'THE GRID, UNPLUGGED' This show of large, abstract drawings is the third New York solo of work by the Indian artist Nasreen Mohamedi (1937-1990), and the most beautiful yet, which means it's as about as beautiful as gallery shows get. Born to a Muslim family, Mohamedi studied art in London and Paris and was fully conversant with contemporary art in the West. Her major influences, though, were Islamic architecture, the modern urban landscape and fellow South Asian artists working in abstract, linear styles. This deeply moving show also includes digital excerpts from her poetic notebooks. Talwar Gallery, 108 East 16th Street, (212) 673-3096, talwargallery.com, through Dec. 20. (Cotter)
 'PERVERTED BY THEATER' This wildly pluralistic group exhibition rebuts the famous 1967 essay ''Art and Objecthood,'' in which the critic Michael Fried condemned what he saw as a corrupting theatricality in new art. In their brochure essay, the curators Franklin Evans and Paul David Young point out theatrical effects in works by Jim Nutt, Mel Bochner, Laylah Ali, Virgil Marti and others. Apex Art, 291 Church Street, near White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-5270, apexart.org, through Dec. 6. (Johnson)
 'THE POETICS OF CLOTH' Emphasizing the place of traditional textiles in works by contemporary African artists, this exhibition includes internationally renowned figures like the Nigerian-born Yinka Shonibare and the Ghanaian El Anatsui. One of the show's discoveries, Grace Ndiritu, uses printed fabrics in an evocative four-screen video installation -- allowing her bare limbs to peek out from behind curtains or posing as a mummified Olympia. A related show, ''The Essential Art of African Textiles: Design Without End,'' is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart, through Dec. 6. (Rosenberg)
 'ZERO IN NEW YORK' This gorgeous museumlike exhibition displays works by members of the Zero Group, a loose association of '60s-era European avant-gardists. It features works dating from 1957 to 1966 by about 20 artists, including Piero Manzoni, Arman, Yves Klein and Jean Tinguely. Founded in the late 1950s by two Germans, Heinz Mack and Otto Piene, the Zero Group rejected personal expressionism in favor of radically new forms of abstraction. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, speronewestwater.com, through Dec. 20. (Johnson)
 Out of Town
 INSTITUTE OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'R. CRUMB'S UNDERGROUND,' through Dec. 7. The former underground comic artist R. Crumb has created some of the most memorable characters in cartoon history, including the irascible guru Mr. Natural; the suave, shamelessly randy Fritz the Cat; the angry Amazon Devil Girl; and R. Crumb himself, a figure comparable to the autobiographical alter-egos of Woody Allen and Philip Roth. He has been a fearlessly irreverent satirist and an intrepid explorer of his own twisted psyche. And he is excruciatingly funny. This enthralling show presents more than 100 works from all phases of his five-decade career. 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS, BOSTON: 'RACHEL WHITEREAD: PLACE (VILLAGE),' through Jan. 25. This exhibition, the centerpiece of the museum's mini-survey devoted to the British sculptor Rachel Whiteread, may strike the artist's admirers as a bizarre and kitschy departure. Viewers who have never seen one of her room-size casts won't really get a sense of her work from this installation, which is making its United States debut. Still, the show, which includes drawings and a few smaller sculptures, reveals the more emotive side of an artist who can come off as somber and humorless. 465 Huntington Avenue, (617) 267-9300, mfa.org. (Rosenberg)
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'JAN LIEVENS: A DUTCH MASTER REDISCOVERED,' through Jan. 11. Although not a household name now, Jan Lievens once was famous throughout Northern Europe for his portraits and his religious and history paintings. A child prodigy, he was a friend and colleague of Rembrandt's. Early in their careers, the two painters worked closely together, and many of Lievens's paintings later were misattributed to Rembrandt. Lievens was not Rembrandt's equal, but he had his moments, especially in remarkably precocious paintings that he made as a teenager. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)
 NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART: 'POMPEII AND THE ROMAN VILLA: ART AND CULTURE AROUND THE BAY OF NAPLES,' through March 22. This show about the opulent lifestyle of the Roman elite before the A.D. 79 eruption of Vesuvius includes recent discoveries on view in the United States for the first time, as well as finds from excavations dating to the mid-18th century. The galleries unfold according to the floor plan of a typical villa, and the installation -- which includes decorative columns, wall borders, living plants and reproductions of mosaics -- works hard to maintain the illusion of classical architecture. The exhibition moves from artifacts reflecting ancient Romans' infatuation with Greek culture to the rediscovery of Pompeii by 18th-century Europeans, suggesting that every culture finds affirmation of its taste and sophistication in a previous golden age. National Mall, Fourth and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Rosenberg)

FILM SERIES
 THE KING OF COMEDY: JERRY LEWIS IN CONVERSATION WITH PETER BOGDANOVICH (Saturday) The Man in the White Socks himself -- and a plausible candidate for America's greatest living filmmaker -- will be interviewed onstage by Mr. Bogdanovich, himself a filmmaker and critic of considerable gifts, as well as a friend of Mr. Lewis's for 45 years. Cinephilic bliss, sponsored by the Museum of the Moving Image. At 7 p.m., TheTimesCenter, 242 West 41st Street, Manhattan, (718) 784-4520, movingimage.us; $48. (Dave Kehr) 
 CAROLE LOMBARD (Friday through Thursday) Film Forum kicks off a 12-day celebration of the incomparable Lombard, whose entire career is a rebuke to the received wisdom that beautiful women can't be funny, with an essential double feature on Friday and Saturday: ''Twentieth Century,'' the 1934 screwball comedy, directed by Howard Hawks, that made her a star, and ''My Man Godfrey,'' Gregory La Cava's seamless blend of high comedy and social consciousness, in which Lombard co-stars with her ex-husband, William Powell. Coming rarities include several of Lombard's hard-to-see early Paramount films, presented in new 35-millimeter prints provided by the current rights holder, Universal Pictures. Among them are Stuart Walker's ''White Woman'' (1933), Henry Hathaway's ''Now and Forever'' (1934), Erle C. Kenton's ''From Hell to Heaven'' (1933) and Frank Tuttle's ''It Pays to Advertise.'' (Through Dec. 2.) Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $11. (Kehr)
 PUNK 'N' PIE (Friday through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) The BAMcinematek offers a novel approach to celebrating Thanksgiving, with 10 features emanating from or inspired by the British punk rock movement of the mid-'70s. This weekend's offerings include Brian Gibson's 1980 ''Breaking Glass'' (Friday); Michael Winterbottom's 2002 ''24 Hour Party People'' (Saturday); Wolfgang Buld's 1978 documentary on the related ska movement, ''Reggae in a Babylon'' (Sunday); and the 1982 performance documentary ''Rough Cut and Ready Dubbed,'' directed by Hasan Shah and Dom Shaw (Sunday). (Through Nov. 30.) BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $11. (Kehr)
 'TORA-SAN MEETS THE SONGSTRESS AGAIN' (Friday) Japan Society continues its monthly screenings of ''Tora-san'' favorites, drawn from the long-running series (48 films between 1969 and 1995) starring Kiyoshi Atsumi as a soft-hearted traveling salesman. This month's selection dates from 1975 and finds Tora-san running into an old flame, a beautiful singer (Ruriko Asaoka), who has recently shed her husband. Yoji Yamada directed, as he did all but two episodes in the series. At 7:30 p.m., 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org; $11. (Kehr) 
 MOVIE LISTINGS
 Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.
 'APPALOOSA' (R, 1:47) Ed Harris, who directed, stars with Viggo Mortensen, Renee Zellweger and Jeremy Irons in this sly, relaxed western, which is less concerned with gunfighting and law and order than with jealousy, friendship and the perils of frontier romance. It's a somber shoot-em-up with the mischievous soul of a sex comedy. (A. O. Scott)
 'BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA' (PG, 1:25) As multimillion-dollar frivolities about the pets of the ruling class go, ''Beverly Hills Chihuahua'' is reasonably diverting. As one released in the middle of an economic meltdown, its mere existence feels utterly insane. (Nathan Lee)
 'BODY OF LIES' (R, 2:06) Ridley Scott's new movie raises a potentially disturbing question. If terrorism has become boring, does that mean that the terrorists have won? Or, conversely, is the grinding tedium of this film good news for our side, evidence of the awesome might of Western popular culture, which can turn even the most bloodthirsty real-world villains into fodder for contrived and lifeless action thrillers? (Scott)
 'THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS' (PG-13, 1:33) In this wildly offensive British film, based on John Boyne's allegorical children's novel and directed by Mark Herman, the Holocaust is trivialized, glossed over, kitsched up, commercially exploited and hijacked for a tragedy about a Nazi family. A must to avoid. (Manohla Dargis)
 'BURN AFTER READING' (R, 1:36) A predictably self-amused comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen with a tricky plot, visual style, er, to burn, but so little heart as to warrant a Jarvik 8. With George Clooney, Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt. (Dargis)
 'CHANGELING' (R, 2:01) Clint Eastwood directs Angelina Jolie in this long, shapeless tale of a mother in distress, based on the true story of Christine Collins, whose young son disappeared in Los Angeles in 1928. There are some effective scenes, but the labored period details, the flagging pace and Ms. Jolie's exhausting performance get in the way of any real intensity or insight. (Scott)
 'A CHRISTMAS TALE' (No rating, 2:30, in French) Arnaud Desplechin, a master of emotional chaos, slyly reinvents the home-for-the-holidays film in this wayward, exuberant story of love, death and sibling rivalry. Mathieu Amalric, Melvil Poupaud and Anne Consigny play the three surviving children of Jean-Paul Rousillon and Catherine Deneuve, but that volatile unit is only the nucleus in a series of explosions and chain reactions. (Scott) 
 'DEAR ZACHARY: A LETTER TO A SON ABOUT HIS FATHER' (No rating, 1:35) It is impossible not to be fired up by Kurt Kuenne's incendiary cri de coeur, a personal documentary about the murder of his best friend and a polemical rant against the Canadian justice system for coddling a dangerous sociopath. (Stephen Holden)
 'DOSTANA' (No rating, 2:25, in Hindi) It may seem like a cheat that the heroes of the first big-budget Bollywood movie to feature gay characters are just pretending. But there's a tolerance lesson embedded in this good-hearted comedy, not to mention a propensity for ogling male bodies. The film stars John Abraham and his six-pack abs and the always game Abhishek Bachchan. (Rachel Saltz)
 'THE DUCHESS' (PG-13, 1:45) An overstuffed, underbaked portrait of the cosseted, tightly corseted late-18th-century life of Georgiana Spencer, the Duchess of Devonshire. Saul Dibbs directs, Keira Knightley stars, and Ralph Fiennes acts. (Dargis)
 'THE DUKES' (PG-13, 1:34) A shambling, cornball heist comedy in which the members of a one-hit wonder vocal group from the early '60s conspire to rob the gold from the safe in a dental laboratory, ''The Dukes'' wants to be the ''Big Deal on Madonna Street'' of doo-wop nostalgia (the Italian-American division.) (Holden)
 'EAGLE EYE' (PG-13, 1:58) Shia LaBoeuf and Michelle Monaghan on the run from something. From what? A ticked-off government computer, apparently. Did I spoil it? Sorry. I mean, you're welcome. (Scott)
 'FLY ME TO THE MOON' (G, 1:30) Three flies stow away on Apollo 11 in this animated feature created start to finish expressly for 3-D. But not, alas, for pleasure or art. (Lee)
 'HAPPY-GO-LUCKY' (R, 1:58) Happiness is a complicated, difficult matter, and for the bopping bloom at the center of Mike Leigh's generous, expansive new film -- a gurgling stream of giggles, laughs and words played by a glorious Sally Hawkins -- it's also a question of faith. (Dargis)
 'THE HAUNTING OF MOLLY HARTLEY' (PG-13, 1:26) This unexpectedly cynical addition to the teen-scream genre has God and Satan duking it out for the soul of the 17-year-old Molly (Haley Bennett), whose 18th birthday promises a showdown with ''the darkness.'' No more than a big-screen lasso for the ''Gossip Girl'' and ''Supernatural'' demographic, the movie's tame narrative is likely to offend only those who believe the Lord is invincible. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
 'HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3: SENIOR YEAR' (G, 1:40) The third chapter of this Disney musical franchise moves smoothly from the Disney Channel to the big screen. If the story is negligible, as long as the film is singing and dancing, it is irresistibly peppy froth set in wholesome teenage never-never land. (Holden)
 'HOW ABOUT YOU' (No rating, 1:30) A good scolding and a toke on a joint: that's all it takes to turn the curmudgeonly British old folks in ''How About You'' into goofy pussycats frolicking on the lawn of their comfy retirement home. Would that it were so easy to transform angry, embittered elders into a happy family. (Holden) 
 'I'VE LOVED YOU SO LONG' (PG-13, 1:55, in French) The French novelist Philippe Claudel, making his debut as a director, shows sobriety and restraint in this story of a woman making her way back into normal life after serving a prison sentence for the murder of her son. Kristin Scott Thomas gives a remarkable lead performance, and Elsa Zylberstein as her sister is nearly as good. A climactic plot twist cheapens and diminishes the film somewhat, but it is still, for the most part, a powerful and subtle melodrama. (Scott)
 'JCVD' (R, 1:32) As in Jean-Claude van Damme, who plays a version of himself in this half-clever, very self-conscious thriller-comedy about an aging action hero caught up in a bank robbery. (Scott)
 'LET THE RIGHT ONE IN' (No rating, 1:54, in Swedish) A charming and chilling Swedish love story directed by Tomas Alfredson about a lonely boy and the girl next door who may just happen to be a vampire. (Dargis)
 'MADAGASCAR: ESCAPE 2 AFRICA' (PG, 1:29) Lions roar (and dance) in this animated sequel about a gang of errant zoo animals gone wild, but it's the penguins, chimps and a deranged lemur that rule. (Dargis)
 'MAN ON WIRE' (PG-13, 1:34) Philippe Petit's 1974 tightrope walk between the towers of the World Trade Center might have seemed, at the time, like a crazy stunt, but James Marsh's beautiful documentary understands it as a work of art. (Scott)
 'MAX PAYNE' (PG-13, 1:40) In this video-game-based action-revenge spectacle, Mark Wahlberg battles winged creatures, drug addicts and a ruthless pharmaceutical company. Or something. (Scott)
 'NICK & NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST' (PG-13, 1:30) Teenagers falling in love on the tame night streets of Manhattan. As thin as an iPod Nano and as sweetly self-conscious as a Facebook page, but not without charm. (Scott)
 'NIGHTS IN RODANTHE' (PG-13, 1:37) Richard Gere and Diane Lane fumble like teenagers and mouth some pitiful, platitudinous, risible dialogue in a soggy romance directed by George C. Wolfe and based on a Nicholas Sparks book. (Dargis)
 'NOAH'S ARC: JUMPING THE BROOM' (R, 1:41) The Logo television series ''Noah's Arc'' has yielded its own feature: an agreeable melodrama unlikely to reach an audience beyond the show's, about prosperous gay black men in Los Angeles. Here cast members gather at Martha's Vineyard for the nuptials of the title character, and despite a fling or two within the group, the emphasis is on communication, monogamy and child rearing. This is a group that shares a prayer at the dining room table. (Andy Webster)
 'ONE DAY YOU'LL UNDERSTAND' (No rating, 1:29, in French) The Israeli director Amos Gitai turns his attention to France, exploring the confusion of a successful businessman digging into the suppressed World War II history of his family. Piercing and understated, with a lovely performance by Jeanne Moreau as a survivor with an ambivalent relationship with the past and her own identity. (Scott)
 'OTTO: OR, UP WITH DEAD PEOPLE' (No rating, 1:34) Gay zombies, radical Marxism and pretentious avant-garde filmmakers mix it up in the latest from the irreverent cult auteur Bruce LaBruce. (Lee)
 'PRAY THE DEVIL BACK TO HELL' (No rating, 1:12) Directed by Gini Reticker and produced by Abigail E. Disney, this no-frills, no-nonsense inquiry into human beings at their absolute worst and heartening best charts the overlooked victory of the Liberian women's peace movement. (Dargis)
 'PRIDE AND GLORY' (R, 2:05) An extended family of Irish cops fighting, shouting and weeping in New York. Nothing you haven't seen before, but not badly directed by Gavin O'Connor, and featuring a fine, quiet performance by Noah Emmerich, who steals the picture from the designated blusterers Colin Farrell and Edward Norton. (Scott)
 'QUANTUM OF SOLACE' (PG-13, 1:46) When did James Bond get so serious? Daniel Craig is probably the most able actor to play 007, but there is something heavy and lugubrious about his understanding of the character, and also about Marc Forster's approach to this venerable series. Mathieu Amalric is an excellent villain, and some of the action is crisp and exciting, though some of it is muddy and incoherent. Olga Kurlyenko is the main Bond girl, though Bond's thirst for vengeance seems to have dampened his libido, as well as his wit. (Scott)
 'RACHEL GETTING MARRIED' (R, 1:54) Anne Hathaway plays Kym, furloughed from rehab to attend her sister Rachel's wedding. The director, Jonathan Demme, working from a script by Jenny Lumet, takes a fairly conventional family-therapy drama and packs it with exuberant vitality. There is ample sorrow and recrimination at this party, but nonetheless you'll be sorry when it ends. (Scott)
 'RELIGULOUS' (R, 1:41) The comedian and outspoken religious nonbeliever Bill Maher travels the world interviewing Christians, Jews and Muslims about their beliefs, which he views as nonsense. (Holden)
 'REPO! THE GENETIC OPERA' (R, 1:37) Awful! The Monotonous Rock Opera. (Lee)
 'ROCKNROLLA' (R, 1:57) In his latest, the director Guy Ritchie pumps up the volume, tilts the camera, flexes the muscle, struts the stuff for some bang bang, blah blah. (Dargis)
 'ROLE MODELS' (R, 1:35) The newest entry in the increasingly worn-out Boys-Will-Be-Babies-Until-They-Are-Forced-to-Grow-Up school of arrested-development comedies follows the silly misadventures of two flailing Peter Pans who are forced to do community service to avoid jail time. (Holden)
 'SAW V' (R, 1:39) It would be nice to be able to say that the latest installment of the ''Saw'' franchise is a revolting, nerve-racking trip into the cesspool of the human imagination, since that seems to be the general point of this undying franchise. This time around, however, the result is just plain boring, and even a little tame -- albeit by the standards of a genre that helped bring the phrase ''torture porn'' into existence. (Lee)
 'A SECRET' (No rating, 1:45, in French) Claude Miller's adaptation of Philippe Grimbert's autobiographical novel is a subtle and moving exploration of intimacy and desire in a French Jewish family before and after World War II. (Scott)
 'THE SECRET LIFE OF BEES' (PG-13, 1:50) A warm bath of folksiness, racial tolerance, life lessons and honey in South Carolina, around 1964, from Sue Monk Kidd's best seller. (Scott) 
 'SLUMDOG MILLIONAIRE' (R, 2:00) A modern fairy tale from Danny Boyle (''Trainspotting'') about a pauper angling to become a prince, this sensory blowout largely takes place amid the squalor of Mumbai, India, where lost children and dogs sift through trash so fetid that you swear you can smell the discarded mango as well as its peel. (Dargis)
 'SOUL MEN' (R, 1:43) Vulgar and rambling, this comedy about two washed-up R&B singers has a few things going for it, mainly a smart and lively soundtrack and Bernie Mac, in one of his last performances, as half of the main duo. (Samuel L. Jackson is the churlish other half.) (Scott)
 'STRANDED: I'VE COME FROM A PLANE THAT CRASHED ON THE MOUNTAINS' (No rating, 2:06, in Spanish) The 16 survivors of the famous 1972 plane crash in the Andes that decimated a Uruguayan rugby team and forced them to cannibalize the corpses of the casualties to stay alive tell their story in Gonzalo Arijon's documentary. It is an inspiring story of teamwork and solidarity. (Holden)
 'SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK' (R, 2:04) To say that Charlie Kaufman's feature debut is one of the best films of the year or even the one closest to my heart is such a pathetic response to its soaring ambition that I might as well pack it in right now. (In other words: Go!) (Dargis)
 'TELL NO ONE' (No rating, 2:05, in French) In the shortcut language of a movie pitch, Guillaume Canet's delicious contemporary thriller is ''Vertigo'' meets ''The Fugitive'' by way of ''The Big Sleep.'' This French adaptation of Harlan Coben's 2001 best seller (same name) is the kind of conspiracy-minded mystery almost no one seems capable of creating anymore, except David Lynch in his surreal way. Beautifully written and acted, it is a labyrinth in which to get deliriously lost. (Holden)
 'VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA' (PG-13, 1:36) A rueful comedy from Woody Allen about two young American women (Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall) who, during a summertime European idyll, savor numerous Continental delicacies, some provided by the equally alluring Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. (Dargis)
 'W.' (PG-13, 2:09) Neither a pure (nor impure) sendup of the president nor a wholesale takedown, Oliver Stone's queasily entertaining biopic reminds us what a long, strange trip it's been to the Bush White House. Josh Brolin stars as the frat boy who would be king. (Dargis)
 'ZACK AND MIRI MAKE A PORNO' (R, 1:37) Indeed they do. And Kevin Smith has made a meandering, not quite convincing, love story with a filthy mind and a soft heart. (Scott)

HEADLINE: Stocks Drop Sharply and Credit Markets Seize Up

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and JACK HEALY

 BODY:
As a new bout of fear gripped the financial markets, stocks fell sharply again on Thursday, continuing a months-long plunge that has wiped out the gains of the last decade. 
 The credit markets seized up as confidence in the nation's financial system ebbed and people rushed to put money in Treasuries, the safest of investments. Some markets are now back to where they were before Congress approved the $700 billion financial rescue in October. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell nearly 445 points, or 5.6 percent. The broad market sank to its lowest level since 1997 -- before the dot-com boom, the Nasdaq market bust and the ensuing bull market that drove stocks to record heights.
 With Thursday's rout, $8.3 trillion in stock market wealth has been erased in the last 13 months. 
 Investors are growing increasingly worried that big banks like Citigroup, JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America, which have all received billions of dollars from the government to bolster their finances, are still too weak. The price of Citigroup's shares plunged 26.4 percent on Thursday and other financial shares fell to fresh lows. 
 Citigroup, which is under pressure from some investors to split itself or sell businesses, plans to hold a meeting on Friday to update executives on the company's condition. 
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.7 percent, leaving that benchmark down about 52 percent from its peak in October 2007. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 7,552.29, barely above its low in October 2002 during the depths of the last bear market. The Nasdaq fell 5 percent, to 1,316.12. 
 ''This is a response to real fear,'' said Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, an investment firm in New York. ''We each have to look inside and say, is the fear warranted?'' 
 The fear was reflected in a stampede for the safety of government securities. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year bill rose 2- 22/32, to 106- 10/32 and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was at 3.01 percent, down from 3.32 percent late Wednesday. 
 The sell-off in equities gathered force over the last several days and brought an abrupt end to what had been a modest improvement in financial markets. After the Federal Reserve began making short-term loans directly to businesses last month, a semblance of normalcy returned to credit markets, and the stock market, although volatile, held above its old lows. 
 But investor confidence, which has been shaky since the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, was dealt a severe blow when the Treasury Department announced last week that it would not buy troubled mortgage assets using the $700 billion that Congress approved in October. Economic reports showing rising unemployment, falling consumer prices and disastrous retail sales compounded the damage. The risk that one or all of the Detroit automakers might go bankrupt added to the gloom.
 ''The profit drag on corporate America is widening and deepening, and this is leading to more layoffs and cutbacks in capital spending, which is extending and deepening the recession,'' said Stuart Schweitzer, global markets strategist for J.P. Morgan Private Bank. ''We've gotten into a full-blown, self-feeding downturn.''
 More bad economic news arrived on Thursday morning the Labor Department reported that new claims for unemployment benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 542,000 last week, the highest level since July 1992. Unemployment is also climbing at a rapid clip in Europe, and the once-sizzling economies in Asia and Latin America are starting to sputter. Early on Friday, Singapore reported that its third-quarter gross domestic product fell at a 6.8 percent annualized pace. 
 In Asian trading early Friday, stocks were down nearly 3 percent in Japan, Australia and New Zealand. On Thursday, most European markets closed down more than 3 percent for the day. 
 The global nature of the slowdown is a reason that oil prices have fallen spectacularly in recent months. On Thursday, oil futures, which had touched $145 this summer, settled below $50 a barrel for the first time since 2005.
 The sell-off in markets has been all the more severe because of forced selling by hedge funds, mutual funds, insurance companies and banks, all of which are being compelled to sell at the same time because of pressures from investors, lenders, regulators and rising insurance claims. 
 There have been spectacular declines in investments like commercial mortgage-backed securities, which are collections of loans backed by shopping malls, office buildings and apartments. Prices of those securities have fallen 20 percent just this month, mostly in response to a report about anticipated defaults on just two loans. The price of insuring against a default on commercial mortgages has more than doubled in less than a week.
 ''Where the credit markets are trading, it's all but implying a 1929 scenario,'' said Joe Balestrino, fixed income strategist at Federated Investors, who added that he thought prices had fallen too far in many cases.
 The troubles in the credit market are not limited to risky assets. The mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which the government took over in September, have had to pay a steep premium over rates at which the Treasury borrows because policy makers have not explicitly guaranteed their debt.
 Investors said the weak condition of many large banks had exacerbated the pain in the financial system because those institutions served as critical intermediaries in the trading of securities, particularly in the credit markets, where securities do not trade on exchanges. Because they need every spare dollar to shore up their own health, those banks are not as willing to make markets in securities that may be even slightly risky.
 Shares of Citigroup, for instance, have fallen more than 50 percent this week, to $4.71. Earlier in the week, the bank said it would nearly double previously announced layoffs to 52,000, or 14 percent of its total staff. Other big institutions like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have been reducing their reliance on borrowed money because they have decided to become bank holding companies subject to regulation by the Federal Reserve.
 ''They are the middleman, and they have just gotten killed,'' Andrew Feltus, a bond fund manager at Pioneer Investments, said about big banks and securities firms.
 Still, in a sign that some investors have not lost all faith, two dozen stocks in the S.& P. 500-stock index rose, albeit barely, and among them were two of the American's troubled automakers. 
 General Motors and Ford had a rare positive day on Thursday after Congressional leaders left open the door for federal aid to them and for Chrysler, which is privately held. Still, Democratic leaders criticized the executives of the companies and said they needed to make a more persuasive case that they would be responsible stewards of government money. G.M. and Ford were up slightly, though still close to their lowest levels in decades.

HEADLINE: Fields of Grain and Losses

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

DATELINE: WALTERS, Okla. 

 BODY:
The farmers said it would not last, and they were right.
 When the price of wheat, corn, soybeans and just about every other food grown in the ground began leaping skyward two years ago, farmers were pleased, of course. But generally they refused to believe that the good times would be permanent. They had seen too many booms that were inevitably followed by busts.
 Now, with the suddenness of a hailstorm flattening a field, hard times are back on the American farmstead. The price paid for crops is dropping much faster than the cost of growing them. 
 The government reported this week that the cost of goods and services nationwide fell by a record amount in October as frantic businesses tried to lure customers. While lower prices are good for consumers in the short run, a prolonged stretch of deflation would wreak havoc as companies struggled to stay afloat. 
 In this lonesome stretch near the Texas border, farmers are getting an early taste of a deflationary world. They have finished planting next year's winter wheat, turning the fields a brilliant emerald green. But it cost about $6 a bushel in fuel, seed and fertilizer to put the crop in. That is $1 more than they could sell it for today, and never mind other expenses like renting land.
 This looming loss sharpens their regret that they did not unload more of this year's crop back when they harvested it in May. They knew the boom would end, but not so soon. 
 ''I waited all my life for wheat to go from $4 to $5,'' said Jimmy Wayne Kinder, a fourth-generation farmer. ''Then it hit $10, and we were all asking, 'What are we going to do?' ''
 Mr. Kinder, who farms about 5,000 acres with his father, James Kinder Jr., and his brother, Kevin, held onto much of his wheat, hoping that prices would go still higher. Instead, they plunged. ''I lay in bed at night kicking myself,'' Mr. Kinder said.
 The farmers in Walters still have to worry about drought and floods and grain bugs and army worms, as they have for decades, but they have new anxieties beyond their control: Manic commodity markets. A rising dollar that makes their crops more expensive overseas. And -- an urgent new concern this fall -- the solvency of their banks. 
 In September, when banks began failing at the height of the credit crisis, Mr. Kinder called Mickey Harris, his banker at the First State Bank of Temple. ''Are we going to be O.K.?'' he asked. 
 Mr. Harris offered reassurances that the privately owned, one-location bank was fine, but he feels the fate of farmers, until recently one of the strongest sectors in a slumping economy, is less certain.
 Unless wheat stages an unexpected recovery, Mr. Harris said, ''a year from now these farmers' net worth will surely be less.''
 Oklahoma exports two-thirds of its wheat, more than the country as a whole. That worked to the state's advantage in 2007 and the first half of 2008, as a combination of bad harvests in Australia, the cheap dollar and rising Asian consumption created intense international demand.
 The state's farmers responded, naturally enough, by ramping up production. Because of better weather and therefore a better yield, 166.5 million bushels of wheat were harvested in Oklahoma this spring, a 10-year high. And because of the high prices, the crop was valued for the first time at more than $1 billion, nearly twice as much as 2007 and nearly three times as much as 2006.
 ''They made a killing,'' said Kim Anderson, a grain economist at Oklahoma State University. 
 Assuming, that is, they sold. The farmers who cashed in at the right moment are acquiring legendary status. ''I know a fellow that sold some wheat for $12 a bushel. That was almost beyond belief,'' said James Kinder, 74.
 But his son suspects that most were like the Kinder family: they either did not sell or did not sell enough. 
 The Kinders still have about 40 percent of their wheat, stored on the farm and in commercial grain facilities. ''Farmers are terrible marketers,'' said Jimmy Wayne Kinder, 50. ''We fall in love with our crop.''
 It was the same misguided optimism that caused homeowners to think their houses would always keep increasing at a 20 percent annual clip. Farmers across the country fell prey to it.
 David Kanable at the Oregon Farm Center, a mill near Madison, Wis., was paying $7.25 a bushel for corn in June. ''We never had a farmer lock in at that price. They wanted $8,'' Mr. Kanable said. On Thursday, the mill was paying $3.17 a bushel.
 When commodity prices were feverish, the price of good farmland exploded, too. Cropland values rose about 20 percent in the Midwest farm belt last year, capping a multiyear rise, according to the Agriculture Department. Walters and other areas southern Oklahoma, where the land is not as rich and the crops have to be coaxed from the soil, were swept up in the excitement. 
 The previous land boom around Walters was in the late 1970s, a reaction to the high commodity prices of that era. Land went for as much as a thousand dollars an acre. 
 ''Doctors and lawyers were buying the land from farmers,'' said the senior Mr. Kinder. ''Then prices fell, and those same doctors and lawyers were begging the farmers to take it off their hands.''
 Prices dropped to $500 an acre. Only in the last few years did they begin to approach the records set three decades ago.
 On a recent sparkling Saturday morning, two dozen farmers showed up for an auction of 160 acres owned by a Kansas woman whose family had held it for decades. The farmer who worked the land, Russ Scherler, brought his checkbook but little hope that he would be top bidder. 
 Rick High, the auctioneer, chatted up the farmers from the back of his pickup, saying that credit was tight but land was a safe haven. His opening demand: $150,000. Not a farmer moved. ''How about 120?'' Mr. High asked. No luck. And so the price sank to $60,000, where the first bid was made.
 From there, it slowly climbed back up, finally going for $122,000 -- about $760 an acre -- to a farmer who had sold some land earlier and now needed to buy to avoid tax charges. 
 Mr. Scherler was disappointed, but not surprised. ''Missed me by about $30,000,'' he said.
 A half-mile up the road, a parcel the same size that was deemed slightly inferior had sold a few weeks earlier for $128,000. The market for land is definitely weakening. 
 One reason is that the investors and part-time farmers are once again dropping away. Jim Mumford, an equipment dealer in Walters, says demand for small tractors has dried up. Where part-timers might once have put in a small crop, there are only weeds. ''They're holding off till things get better,'' Mr. Mumford said. 
 The Kinders are making their own adjustments.
 ''The market says, 'Here's the price. You want to make any money, get below it,' '' said Jimmy Wayne Kinder.
 One way to do that is by diversifying, so they bought 2,000 head of cattle. This has its own risks: a hard winter will mean less grazing for the cattle, which translates into buying more feed. It is also a gamble that cattle prices will rise instead of sinking, as they have been all fall. 
 Another way to get under the market price is by trying to do more with less. The Kinders are practically spoon-feeding nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers onto their wheat.
 It is a queasy time. ''Given the current economic environment, I don't think anyone can predict commodity prices,'' said Mr. Anderson, the economist. 
 If production costs do not fall or wheat prices do not rise bynext spring, he said, farmers will be contacting their representatives in Congress and requesting higher price supports. 
 The elder Mr. Kinder, who is pessimistic enough to think land values will once again fall 50 percent, is taking it philosophically. 
 ''People have great prosperity and everyone gets spoiled,'' he said. ''Then there are times of great hardship and everyone learns patience.''

JPMorgan Leads
 In Deal Rankings
 When investors take fright, as they did again this week, they seek the comfort of safe securities like Treasury bonds. Corporate executives behave similarly when choosing help on Wall Street. And the biggest beneficiary appears to be JPMorgan. 
 That's evident from the way this year's league tables -- the scorecards on who's advising on the most mergers and selling more stocks and bonds -- are shaping up. These had been Wall Street's core competencies until they started betting shareholders' capital in the markets. 
 Now, with markets in turmoil, banks are returning to client-focused, corporate finance businesses. That's why this year's rankings may count more than normal.
 And for the first time in memory, a single bank, JPMorgan, is poised to nab a triple play at the top of the M.& A., debt and equities rankings. With the closure this week of InBev's purchase of Anheuser-Busch, the bank has advised on $884 billion worth of deals around the world, edging out the leader, Goldman Sachs, according to Dealogic.
 JPMorgan holds the top slot in underwriting equities, again beating Goldman. In debt, JPMorgan trails Barclays Capital -- only because the British bank acquired Lehman Brothers and inherited its league table credits. Adjusted for this, JPMorgan is ahead. 
 Though not immune to the ailing economy and financial system, JPMorgan has stood tall in the crisis. Its avoidance of questionable subprime securities left it with fewer assets to write down, and capital to acquire Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual.
 That's not only helped its stock -- JPMorgan's market capitalization is now three times larger than Citigroup's -- it has helped win business. The reason is simple. Companies need capital, which JPMorgan's relatively healthy balance sheet offers; and their executives want to know the bankers they hire will be around when needed. 
 Of course, even though it may have bragging rights now, corporate finance activity is likely to shrink. That's a reason JPMorgan is preparing to ax jobs at the investment bank in coming weeks, according to a person with direct knowledge of the plan. The challenge will be to retain leadership when the market normalizes. 
 Fortunately for JPMorgan's boss, Jamie Dimon, continuing problems at rivals like Citigroup and Goldman, whose stock fell below its May 1999 offer price for the first time on Thursday, suggest he has time to plan.
 Money on the Table
 Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac bonds should be ideal for investors seeking high returns on low-risk debt. But they're staying away in droves, reflecting skepticism over whether the United States will make good on its guarantees.
 Fannie Mae's 10-year bonds now yield 1.81 percentage points more than equivalent Treasuries, three times as big a spread as when the government put it and Freddie Mac into conservatorship in September. 
 Big investors, including China, are leaving money on the table by favoring Treasury bonds over the debt of the government-sponsored enterprises, despite the fact they now have explicit government support that runs to a full guarantee.
 Why? 
 The bond traders who would normally buy G.S.E. debt and sell Treasury bonds when their yields diverged are unable to obtain the debt to finance their activities.
 More importantly, Treasury yields have plumbed record lows as investors scrambled for safe havens. 
 Yet G.S.E. debt has not been snapped up by those seeking to shed risk, despite the government's backing.
 It didn't help that Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. waffled about the extent of the government's backing for the G.S.E.'s at a news conference last week. And both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac just reported record losses. 
 If investors thought Washington's backing was bulletproof, that wouldn't matter. But United States coffers are increasingly stretched. The latest flare-up in the financial crisis, troubles in Detroit and the deterioration of the economy may require more cash. Uncle Sam's resources may be vast, but investors shunning G.S.E. debt are probably right to bet they're not unlimited.

HEADLINE: Early-Decision Applications Are Up at Colleges, in Spite of the Economy

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
Given the current economic downturn, admissions officers at Wesleyan University thought there might be a decline in early-decision applications this year. But when the deadline passed last weekend, they found that the number had risen 40 percent. 
 ''I was surprised, and I was pleased, and I don't have an explanation,'' said Greg Pyke, senior associate dean of admissions at Wesleyan, in Middletown, Conn. ''It's hard to believe that one group of 17-year-olds has become more decisive than the group you saw the previous year. So maybe it's that in a time of economic uncertainty, people want something settled.'' 
 This was supposed to be the year that early-decision applications took a dive. With a recession, the thinking went, selective colleges and universities that use binding early-decision programs to lock in part of their incoming classes would find fewer students ready to commit, and would lose many budget-conscious families to public universities. Indeed, state universities are seeing huge increases in applications. 
 But many selective private institutions are reporting large jumps in early-decision applicants. Dartmouth, Middlebury and Bowdoin are all up about 10 percent over last year; Haverford, 14 percent; Northwestern, 15 percent; and Pomona 20 percent. 
 ''It might have something to do with last year, when some students stayed on the waiting list a little longer, and maybe told their friends, 'If you apply early, you can find out in December,' '' said Art Rodriguez, Pomona's senior associate dean of admissions. ''There's just more anxiety among students and parents as they're going through the process.'' 
 The numbers vary from college to college, of course -- with two of the most selective liberal-arts colleges, Williams and Amherst, near last year's numbers.
 Early decision has become controversial in recent years. Harvard, Princeton and the University of Virginia have eliminated early decision, saying that it favored wealthy applicants who did not need to compare financial-aid offers. 
 Some need-blind colleges said that they had been working to publicize their generous financial aid packages -- and that it seemed to be paying off in early-decision applicants from less-affluent settings. 
 ''Our decisions are need-blind, so I haven't looked, but anecdotally from the reading I've done so far, I'd say it's a very diverse group economically,'' said Maria Laskaris, Dartmouth's dean of admissions. ''I've gotten many more questions from students and parents this year about financial aid, and I think our financial-aid messages have been resonating.'' 
 At Wesleyan, which is also need-blind, Mr. Pyke said the proportion of early-decision applicants applying for financial aid was about the same as last year. 
 Early applications come in more varieties than they once did. While most selective colleges use early-decision programs under which students agree to enroll if accepted, others, like M.I.T., offer nonbinding early-action programs, or, like Stanford, single-choice early action, in which students agree to submit only one early application. 
 Stanford's single-choice early-action applications increased 18 percent this year.
 St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minn., eliminated its popular early-action program this year, pushed back the deadline for binding early decision from Nov. 1 to Nov. 15 -- and had a 50 percent increase in early-decision applicants. 
 ''We used to get the bulk of our pool in early action, but we found we were turning down some great students in the regular-decision pool, while taking some who were not quite so good in early action,'' said Derek Gueldenzoph, the dean of admissions. 
 At M.I.T., applications for the nonbinding early-action program were up 25 percent this year -- and officials said about half the increase was a result of a new partnership with Questbridge, a nonprofit group that connects low-income students with top colleges. Stuart Schmill, the dean of admissions, said about three-quarters of those admitted under the early-action program typically enrolled at M.I.T. 
 This week, students at Berkeley Carroll, a private school in Brooklyn, knowledgeably discussed the choices they had made.
 ''Last year, a girl I know told me that early action was the greatest thing she ever did in her entire life, and it seems very generous, like a kind of security blanket,'' said Emma Belleo, who applied early action to both Goucher College, in Towson, Md., and the State University of New York in New Paltz. 
 Rebecca Ballhaus applied early decision to Brown. ''I've been pretty sure for a while that I would apply there early decision,'' she said. ''I like the other schools on my list, too, but when I thought about where I most wanted to go, it was Brown.''
 Brandon Clarke, Berkeley Carroll's director of college counseling, said that not a single family this year had talked about changing their college plans because of finances.
 ''Maybe education is the last thing people are willing to give up,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Global Forecast by American Intelligence Expects Al Qaeda's Appeal to Falter

BYLINE: By SCOTT SHANE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
A new study of the global future by American intelligence agencies suggests that Al Qaeda could soon be on the decline, having alienated Muslim supporters with indiscriminate killing and inattention to the practical problems of poverty, unemployment and education.
 While not contradicting intelligence assessments suggesting that Al Qaeda remains a major threat with a strong presence in the tribal areas of Pakistan, the report says that the group ''may decay sooner'' than many experts have assumed because of severe weaknesses: ''unachievable strategic objectives, inability to attract broad-based support and self-destructive actions.''
 ''The appeal of terrorism is waning,'' said Mathew J. Burrows, head of long-range analysis in the office of the director of national intelligence and a lead author of ''Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World.'' Mr. Burrows said polls and anecdotal evidence strongly suggested disillusionment among Muslims with Al Qaeda and its methods and goals since the 2001 terrorist attacks. 
 The predicted decline of Al Qaeda is one of the few bright spots in the generally gloomy report, which describes a decline in the United States' world dominance as China, India and other powers assert themselves. 
 ''Although the United States is likely to remain the single most powerful actor, the United States' relative strength -- even in the military realm -- will decline and U.S. leverage will become more constrained,'' the report said. 
 By 2025, it predicted, ''the U.S. will find itself as one of a number of important actors on the world stage,'' playing ''a prominent role in global events'' but not a decisive one as in the past.
 The report said the global shift from West to East in terms of wealth and economic power ''is without precedent in modern history.'' Of a projected population increase of 1.2 billion worldwide by 2025, Western countries would account for only 3 percent, it said.
 ''We're projecting a multipolar world,'' C. Thomas Fingar, chairman of the National Intelligence Council and the government's top intelligence analyst, said Thursday at a briefing on the report. ''The unipolar moment is over, or certainly will be over by 2025.''
 The previous report in the Global Trends series, completed in 2004, anticipated continued American dominance through 2020, though it recognized that the emergence of China and India as powers would transform the geopolitical landscape.
 The new report describes a world riven by increased conflict over scarce food and water supplies and threatened by so-called rogue states and terrorists, widening gaps between rich and poor and an uneven impact of global warming. It said the chance of the use of nuclear weapons, while remaining ''very low,'' would rise in the next two decades as nuclear technology spreads. 
 The report said Russia's emergence as a world power was ''clouded'' by persistent corruption and lagging investment in its critical energy industry. It also noted, without naming a specific country, that a government in Eastern Europe ''could be effectively taken over and run by organized crime.''
 Mr. Fingar acknowledged that the report, in the works for months, did not fully reflect the severity of the global economic crisis. But he said intelligence officials chose not to delay the report, judging that the long-term impact of the economic downturn would not be clear for months.
 The Global Trends reports are produced every four years by the National Intelligence Council, which represents all 16 American intelligence agencies, in part to inform long-term thinking by new administrations. The reports project various possible sequences of events in the future; the new publication notes, between dire forecasts, that ''bad outcomes are not inevitable.''
 Even if Al Qaeda and other terrorist groups gradually lose support, the remaining violent extremists may have access to increasingly lethal technology, including biological weapons, the report found.
 The comments on Al Qaeda's future are based in part on the work of David C. Rapoport, a professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has studied the cycles of terrorist activity in the past, including those associated with anarchism, Marxism and nationalism.
 The report said the global Islamic terrorist movement was likely to outlast Al Qaeda itself, with other groups likely to emerge and supplant it. But it expects a future of frustration and attrition for Al Qaeda, which Osama bin Laden built during the 1990s.
 The intelligence agencies noted that Al Qaeda had focused almost exclusively on terrorism, a contrast with groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, which have transformed themselves into political movements.
 ''Al Qaeda has not achieved broad support in the Islamic world,'' the report said. ''Its harsh pan-Islamist ideology and policies appeal only to a tiny minority of Muslims.''

HEADLINE: New Jobless Claims Reach A 16-Year High, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
New claims for unemployment benefits jumped last week to a 16-year high, the Labor Department said Thursday, providing more evidence of a rapidly weakening job market.
 The government said new applications for jobless benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 542,000 from a downwardly revised figure of 515,000 in the previous week. That was much higher than economists' expectations of 505,000, according to a survey by ThomsonReuters. 
 The department said that was also the highest level of claims since July 1992, when the economy was coming out of a recession.
 The four-week average of claims, which smooths out fluctuations, was even worse: it rose to 506,500, the highest in more than 25 years.
 In addition, the number of people continuing to claim unemployment insurance rose sharply for the third straight week to more than four million, the highest since December 1982, when the economy was in a recession.
 Those figures partly reflect growth in the labor force, which has increased by about half since the early 1980s.
 The unemployment rate in October was 6.5 percent, and last year it averaged 4.6 percent.
 The Federal Reserve released projections on Wednesday that the jobless rate will climb to 7.1 to 7.6 percent next year, according to documents from the Fed's Oct. 29 closed-door deliberations on interest rate policy.
 In another economic report, a private research group said the economy's health declined further in October as stocks, building permits and consumer expectations all fell.
 The Conference Board says its monthly forecast of future economic activity declined 0.8 percent in October, worse than the 0.6 percent decrease expected by economists surveyed by Thomson Reuters. 
 The index, which weighs indicators like manufacturers' new orders and supplier deliveries, has fallen four of the last six months. It rose slightly in September, thanks to federal interventions that increased the money supply.
 Senate Extends Benefits
 WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The Senate passed and sent to President Bush on Thursday legislation to extend jobless benefits for people who have been unemployed for a prolonged period in an economy that is losing jobs.
 By voice vote, the Senate passed the bill, which had already been approved by the House.
 Bush is expected to sign the measure into law.
 The bill would give seven more weeks of government unemployment payments to workers who have exhausted their current jobless benefits. For those in states with the highest unemployment rates, an additional 20 weeks would be allowed.

HEADLINE: Paulson Cautions Against Overregulation

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. called the financial crisis now plaguing the world economy a ''once or twice'' in a 100 years event, even as he warned Thursday against imposing too-strict regulations to prevent a repeat calamity. 
 His remarks follow pledges by world leaders attending last week's emergency economic summit to begin an overhaul of the world's financial regulatory system.
 With the next summit slated for the spring, the work on fleshing out details for the Herculean task will fall to the incoming administration of President-elect Barack Obama and his new Treasury secretary.
 Mr. Paulson, whose boss President Bush leaves office on Jan. 20, acknowledged that the financial crisis was caused by many factors including ''government inaction and mistaken actions, outdated U.S. and global financial regulatory systems, and by the excessive risk-taking of financial institutions.''
 Still, he cautioned against the United States and other countries developing a too-onerous regulatory response.
 ''If we do not correctly diagnose the causes, and instead act in haste to implement more rather than better regulations, we can do long-term harm,'' Mr. Paulson said in a speech in Simi Valley, Calif.
 Earlier this week, lawmakers blasted Mr. Paulson for his handling of a $700 billion financial bailout package to help ease the crisis and restore stability and confidence to unhinged markets.
 Mr. Paulson on Thursday again defended his management, including his decision last week to officially abandon the original rescue strategy: buying rotten mortgages and other bad debts from banks to free up their balance sheets and get them to lend more freely.
 ''By proactively addressing the problems we saw coming and being pragmatic enough to change strategy in the face of changed facts and despite the inevitable criticism -- we prevented a far worse financial crisis,'' Mr. Paulson insisted.
 Focusing the bailout program on infusing billions into banks -- and possibly other types of companies -- to pump up their capital and bolster lending to customers was deemed a faster and more effective approach to stabilizing the financial system than the original centerpiece of the plan, he said.
 ''There was no playbook for responding to a once or twice in a hundred year event,'' Mr. Paulson argued, saying he needed to shift strategy to respond to worsening financial and economic conditions.
 Mr. Paulson again said he believed the Bush administration has taken the necessary steps to prevent a financial market collapse, but he cautioned that it will take time for markets and lending conditions to return to normal.

HEADLINE: Putin Vows to Avoid a Replay Of Past Economic Collapses

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

DATELINE: MOSCOW 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, mindful that Russians have already been traumatized by two financial crises in the last two decades, tried to assure the country on Thursday that it would be able to weather the current one.
 In a keynote speech to the governing party congress, Mr. Putin announced tax cuts to stimulate the economy and increased spending on social programs. With the steep fall in the price of oil, the economy has slowed significantly in recent months, and the Russian stock market has plummeted.
 ''We will do everything in order to prevent a repetition of the collapses of past years in our country,'' Mr. Putin said. ''We will do everything to protect the savings of our citizens in banks, to safeguard the lawful interests of those who invested their own money in the construction of housing, so that there will not be the shocks of 1991 and 1998.'' 
 He was referring to the end of the Soviet Union in 1991 and to the financial crisis of 1998, when Russia defaulted on its debt and drastically devalued the ruble, wiping out many people's life savings. These events have become touchstones for Mr. Putin, who has prided himself on bringing stability and strong growth to the country.
 The current crisis, in other words, could be seen as imperiling Mr. Putin's accomplishments. In his speech, he placed blame for the downturn on repercussions from what he suggested were irresponsible American policies, but he said Russia's financial reserves would help shield the country.
 The Kremlin put away hundreds of billions of dollars in recent years when the prices of oil and other natural resources were soaring, but has been spending that money quickly in an effort to prop up the ruble, the banking system and other areas of the economy. Since early August, Russia has spent nearly $125 billion of its foreign reserves, $57.5 billion of that on backstopping the ruble. 
 The World Bank estimated this week that the Russian economy, which had been increasing at 7 percent a year, would slow to a 3 percent growth rate next year.
 Mr. Putin spoke a day after his protege, President Dmitri A. Medvedev, warned that the world financial crisis was only beginning. ''I am not saying this to frighten anyone,'' Mr. Medvedev said. ''This is simply the truth, and it is something that people in all countries realize now.''
 Mr. Putin's speech had been eagerly awaited because of speculation that he would announce news about his political future. Mr. Medvedev is pushing through a change to the Constitution lengthening the term of president to six years from four, and some analysts have wondered whether Mr. Putin was maneuvering to return to the presidency soon.
 But he gave no hint of his plans on Thursday, focusing his speech on the economic situation as he spoke to leaders of the governing party, United Russia. He acknowledged anxiety in Russia, which at first seemed somewhat insulated from the worldwide crisis because the vast majority of people here had not invested their money in the stock market, in contrast to those in the United States.
 Lately, though, layoffs have spread, and the Kremlin has sought to tamp down any hint of panic. The state-controlled television news, for example, has often sought to minimize coverage of Russia's economic problems.
 ''People, of course, rightly ask us today, 'What awaits us?' '' Mr. Putin said. ''How do the authorities intend to act in order to protect the people in this period of crisis?''
 He answered by contending that the economy and the federal budget remained on solid footing. He said the government would continue to support the ruble, so people should not fear that it would be devalued again.
 ''We have amassed significant financial reserves,'' he said. ''Of course, these can never solve all our problems. But they, these reserves, will give us the freedom to maneuver, will allow us to preserve macroeconomic stability and therefore not permit spikes of inflation or sharp changes in the value of the ruble. For this, we will use all our arsenal of available measures.''

HEADLINE: The Insider's Crusade

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Jan. 20, 2009, will be a historic day. Barack Obama (Columbia, Harvard Law) will take the oath of office as his wife, Michelle (Princeton, Harvard Law), looks on proudly. Nearby, his foreign policy advisers will stand beaming, including perhaps Hillary Clinton (Wellesley, Yale Law), Jim Steinberg (Harvard, Yale Law) and Susan Rice (Stanford, Oxford D. Phil.).
 The domestic policy team will be there, too, including Jason Furman (Harvard, Harvard Ph.D.), Austan Goolsbee (Yale, M.I.T. Ph.D.), Blair Levin (Yale, Yale Law), Peter Orszag (Princeton, London School of Economics Ph.D.) and, of course, the White House Counsel Greg Craig (Harvard, Yale Law). 
 This truly will be an administration that looks like America, or at least that slice of America that got double 800s on their SATs. Even more than past administrations, this will be a valedictocracy -- rule by those who graduate first in their high school classes. If a foreign enemy attacks the United States during the Harvard-Yale game any time over the next four years, we're screwed. 
 Already the culture of the Obama administration is coming into focus. Its members are twice as smart as the poor reporters who have to cover them, three times if you include the columnists. They typically served in the Clinton administration and then, like Cincinnatus, retreated to the comforts of private life -- that is, if Cincinnatus had worked at Goldman Sachs, Williams & Connolly or the Brookings Institution. So many of them send their kids to Georgetown Day School, the posh leftish private school in D.C. that they'll be able to hold White House staff meetings in the carpool line.
 And yet as much as I want to resent these overeducated Achievatrons (not to mention the incursion of a French-style government dominated by highly trained Enarchs), I find myself tremendously impressed by the Obama transition.
 The fact that they can already leak one big appointee per day is testimony to an awful lot of expert staff work. Unlike past Democratic administrations, they are not just handing out jobs to the hacks approved by the favored interest groups. They're thinking holistically -- there's a nice balance of policy wonks, governors and legislators. They're also thinking strategically. As Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute notes, it was smart to name Tom Daschle both the head of Health and Human Services and the health czar. Splitting those duties up, as Bill Clinton did, leads to all sorts of conflicts.
 Most of all, they are picking Washington insiders. Or to be more precise, they are picking the best of the Washington insiders.
 Obama seems to have dispensed with the romantic and failed notion that you need inexperienced ''fresh faces'' to change things. After all, it was L.B.J. who passed the Civil Rights Act. Moreover, because he is so young, Obama is not bringing along an insular coterie of lifelong aides who depend upon him for their well-being. 
 As a result, the team he has announced so far is more impressive than any other in recent memory. One may not agree with them on everything or even most things, but a few things are indisputably true.
 First, these are open-minded individuals who are persuadable by evidence. Orszag, who will probably be budget director, is trusted by Republicans and Democrats for his honest presentation of the facts.
 Second, they are admired professionals. Conservative legal experts have a high regard for the probable attorney general, Eric Holder, despite the business over the Marc Rich pardon.
 Third, they are not excessively partisan. Obama signaled that he means to live up to his postpartisan rhetoric by letting Joe Lieberman keep his committee chairmanship.
 Fourth, they are not ideological. The economic advisers, Furman and Goolsbee, are moderate and thoughtful Democrats. Hillary Clinton at State is problematic, mostly because nobody has a role for her husband. But, as she has demonstrated in the Senate, her foreign-policy views are hardheaded and pragmatic. (It would be great to see her set of interests complemented by Samantha Power's set of interests at the U.N.) 
 Finally, there are many people on this team with practical creativity. Any think tanker can come up with broad doctrines, but it is rare to find people who can give the president a list of concrete steps he can do day by day to advance American interests. Dennis Ross, who advised Obama during the campaign, is the best I've ever seen at this, but Rahm Emanuel also has this capacity, as does Craig and legislative liaison Phil Schiliro.
 Believe me, I'm trying not to join in the vast, heaving O-phoria now sweeping the coastal haut-bourgeoisie. But the personnel decisions have been superb. The events of the past two weeks should be reassuring to anybody who feared that Obama would veer to the left or would suffer self-inflicted wounds because of his inexperience. He's off to a start that nearly justifies the hype.

HEADLINE: The Lame-Duck Economy

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Everyone's talking about a new New Deal, for obvious reasons. In 2008, as in 1932, a long era of Republican political dominance came to an end in the face of an economic and financial crisis that, in voters' minds, both discredited the G.O.P.'s free-market ideology and undermined its claims of competence. And for those on the progressive side of the political spectrum, these are hopeful times.
 There is, however, another and more disturbing parallel between 2008 and 1932 -- namely, the emergence of a power vacuum at the height of the crisis. The interregnum of 1932-1933, the long stretch between the election and the actual transfer of power, was disastrous for the U.S. economy, at least in part because the outgoing administration had no credibility, the incoming administration had no authority and the ideological chasm between the two sides was too great to allow concerted action. And the same thing is happening now. 
 It's true that the interregnum will be shorter this time: F.D.R. wasn't inaugurated until March; Barack Obama will move into the White House on Jan. 20. But crises move faster these days. 
 How much can go wrong in the two months before Mr. Obama takes the oath of office? The answer, unfortunately, is: a lot. Consider how much darker the economic picture has grown since the failure of Lehman Brothers, which took place just over two months ago. And the pace of deterioration seems to be accelerating.
 Most obviously, we're in the midst of the worst stock market crash since the Great Depression: the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has now fallen more than 50 percent from its peak. Other indicators are arguably even more disturbing: unemployment claims are surging, manufacturing production is plunging, interest rates on corporate bonds -- which reflect investor fears of default -- are soaring, which will almost surely lead to a sharp fall in business spending. The prospects for the economy look much grimmer now than they did as little as a week or two ago.
 Yet economic policy, rather than responding to the threat, seems to have gone on vacation. In particular, panic has returned to the credit markets, yet no new rescue plan is in sight. On the contrary, Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, has announced that he won't even go back to Congress for the second half of the $700 billion already approved for financial bailouts. And financial aid for the beleaguered auto industry is being stalled by a political standoff.
 How much should we worry about what looks like two months of policy drift? At minimum, the next two months will inflict serious pain on hundreds of thousands of Americans, who will lose their jobs, their homes, or both. What's really troubling, however, is the possibility that some of the damage being done right now will be irreversible. I'm concerned, in particular, about the two D's: deflation and Detroit.
 About deflation: Japan's ''lost decade'' in the 1990s taught economists that it's very hard to get the economy moving once expectations of inflation get too low (it doesn't matter whether people literally expect prices to fall). Yet there's clear deflationary pressure on the U.S. economy right now, and every month that passes without signs of recovery increases the odds that we'll find ourselves stuck in a Japan-type trap for years.
 About Detroit: There's now a real risk that, in the absence of quick federal aid, the Big Three automakers and their network of suppliers will be forced into liquidation -- that is, forced to shut down, lay off all their workers and sell off their assets. And if that happens, it will be very hard to bring them back. 
 Now, maybe letting the auto companies die is the right decision, even though an auto industry collapse would be a huge blow to an already slumping economy. But it's a decision that should be taken carefully, with full consideration of the costs and benefits -- not a decision taken by default, because of a political standoff between Democrats who want Mr. Paulson to use some of that $700 billion and a lame-duck administration that's trying to force Congress to divert funds from a fuel-efficiency program instead.
 Is economic policy completely paralyzed between now and Jan. 20? No, not completely. Some useful actions are being taken. For example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the lending agencies, have taken the helpful step of declaring a temporary halt to foreclosures, while Congress has passed a badly needed extension of unemployment benefits now that the White House has dropped its opposition. 
 But nothing is happening on the policy front that is remotely commensurate with the scale of the economic crisis. And it's scary to think how much more can go wrong before Inauguration Day.

HEADLINE: Lame Duck? The Dodo Seems a More Apt Bird

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Democratic leaders, exuberant over their Election Day victories, called Congress back to Washington with ambitious plans to push an economic stimulus measure and throw a lifeline to the struggling auto industry. Now, amid fears of deflation, soaring unemployment, plummeting stock prices and deep consumer anxiety, lawmakers are leaving town having approved only a modest extension of jobless benefits. 
 Lawmakers may yet be back next month, but for now the meager results show why lame-duck sessions often do not work. And why some historians and scholars of Congress, not to mention some of the most prominent lawmakers over history, think that calling such sessions lame is overly generous. 
 The result this week was that America's automakers, already reeling from the hard economic times, got banged over the head with a hard lesson about legislative politics in Washington. 
 Democrats are relishing their more robust majority next year -- and a Democratic president -- and so they saw no reason to cave to Republican demands. Republicans, in turn, while chastened by the election results, saw no reason to fast-forward Democratic control of Washington. 
 Several Republican lawmakers who are either retiring or were defeated said they would not support aid for the auto industry. And their impending departures gave them little or no incentive to compromise, evidence of why postelection sessions are dicey. 
 Consider Senator John E. Sununu, Republican of New Hampshire, who lost his bid for a second term, and who on Wednesday objected to a bill offered by Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, to help the auto industry. Ms. Mikulski snarled, ''Boy, am I sorry that is the last act of John Sununu in the Senate.'' 
 Mr. Sununu returned to the floor later. ''Well, it won't be the last thing I do,'' he said. ''If nothing else, the last thing I will do is explain why her legislation was such a terrible idea.'' 
 The Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, knew that this week offered one of his last moments, ahead of two years of wider Democratic control, to dictate what could or could not get through the Senate. 
 And Mr. McConnell made clear that he opposed any new money for Detroit and would only support speeding up access to $25 billion in federally subsidized loans already approved. Democratic leaders rejected that idea, leaving the automakers empty-handed. 
 The assistant majority leader, Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, glumly acknowledged that the effort to aid the auto industry appeared to be mired in lame-duck muck. ''We're at an impasse,'' he said.
 To be sure, there are examples of momentous things occurring in lame-duck sessions. Congress first proposed repealing Prohibition during a lame-duck session in 1933. The Homeland Security Department was created in a lame-duck session in 2002 and several major budget bills have been approved in postelection sessions. 
 Often the focus of such sessions has been narrow. President Bill Clinton was impeached in a lame-duck session in 1998; and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy of Wisconsin was censured in a lame-duck session in 1954. 
 Mostly, however, lame-duck sessions have been rare -- and useless. 
 After a particularly bitter postelection House session in 1982, Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. vowed to never hold another one. He kept that promise. 
 ''Lame-duck sessions are poor excuses for sloppy, secretive legislation,'' John B. Oakes wrote in an Op-Ed in The New York Times after the 1982 session. ''The latest was not only unnecessary but degrading and dangerous.'' 
 In recent years, Congressional leaders have often held postelection sessions hoping to wrap up unfinished business. 
 ''Somehow there is this thought that when you come back after an election that politics is over with and everybody is just going to tackle the issues,'' said Donald K. Ritchie of the Senate Historical Office. ''But the politics are the same, and people are now counting heads as to whether I'll do better or worse in the next Congress. So it's often not a very productive period.'' 
 Mr. Ritchie added, ''Whatever problems they have during the regular session, they are compounded during a lame-duck session.'' 
 The problems in the 110th Congress over the last two years, of course, have been bountiful, with a record number of filibusters in the Senate. 
 In an interview, the former Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, could not mask his disdain for lame-duck sessions. 
 ''In my 35 years in Congress, I have probably been through 15 or 16 lame-duck sessions,'' he said. ''They are always a mess, accomplish little or nothing and wind up being an embarrassment to everybody.'' 
 Mr. Lott said he always resisted holding postelection sessions. ''One time I think I got rolled by Newt and the House guys,'' he said in reference to the former speaker, Newt Gingrich. ''And it was a mess.'' 
 Mr. Lott said that inevitably lawmakers take up controversial issues, guaranteeing that little gets done. ''You just start doing dumb things, all of a sudden everybody has got a bad attitude, and it just doesn't seem to work,'' he said. 
 But Mr. Lott said that if Congressional leaders miscalculated by coming back into session, the automakers made a bigger miscalculation by seeking aid before President-elect Barack Obama took office. ''They have made many calculated mistakes or uncalculated,'' Mr. Lott said of Detroit's Big Three. ''I don't know who they get their advice from.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 26, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Friday about the lame-duck session of Congress misstated the middle initial of an official in the Senate Historical Office who described the political dynamics when lawmakers meet in the autumn after an election. He is Donald A. Ritchie, not K.

HEADLINE: Citigroup Leads the Way as Financial Stocks Go Into Freefall

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
For months, the nation's largest banks have struggled to regain investors' trust. In the center of the vortex is Citigroup, whose precipitous stock-market plunge accelerated on Thursday, sending shock waves through the financial world.
 The shares slumped 26 percent Thursday; the bank has lost half its value in just four days. The chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, will hold a meeting for senior managers Friday to update them on the bank's condition. 
 Investors and analysts have long pressured the bank to consider ways to lift its stock price, including splitting the company or selling pieces. While a few also say the company should consider selling itself outright, there is no certainty that any change would happen soon. Senior executives say the company is financially strong and has ample financing options. Moreover, there are few buyers who would be willing to pay a price that Citigroup would want for its most valuable assets. 
 Citigroup executives are seeking to stabilize the stock price, but at this point they are not actively exploring selling or splitting up the company, according to two people with direct knowledge of the discussions. 
 The bank has posted four consecutive quarters of losses, caused by billions in write-downs. Nine of its investment funds have cratered this year. And now the bank could face a tsunami of new losses in its once-lucrative consumer loan business as the global economy weakens. 
 Within the bank's Manhattan offices, television screens have stopped displaying the company's stock price. Traders have begun making jokes comparing Citigroup to the Titanic.
 But there is a wide gap between what Wall Street investors and Citigroup's executives believe about the company's financial condition. Senior executives feel that Mr. Pandit has followed through on plans to aggressively shrink the company and control costs. The bank has sold tens of billions of dollars' worth of risky assets, improved its capital position and announced plans to eliminate 52,000 jobs by next June. ''We are entering 2009 in a strong position, much stronger than we entered in 2008,'' Mr. Pandit said in a speech to employees this week. ''We will be a long-term winner in this industry.''
 Yet as the drumbeat of bad news about the bank grows louder, investors remain unconvinced. Even a decision by Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia, who bailed out Citicorp in the 1990s, to raise his stake to 5 percent Thursday failed to restore confidence in the bank. Two senior Citigroup executives said the bank had not approached him about raising his investment. The Saudi prince's initial investment soared as Citigroup turned out record profits, only to evaporate over the last year.
 ''The earnings power is there,'' said Charles Peabody, a financial services analyst at Portales Partners. ''It's a question of getting through the credit issues.''
 Other big banks, like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, also tumbled Thursday as the broad stock market sank again, wiping out more than a decade's worth of gains. And Goldman Sachs, once the most sterling American investment bank, fell below the $53 price at which it went public in 1999.
 Investors have long feared that the bad news for banks will get worse as the economy slows. But this latest rout in financial shares, which are now plumbing their lowest depths since the economic crisis broke out, reflects growing concern that banks like Citigroup will require vast sums of additional capital, possibly from the government, to cope with the pain to come.
 Home mortgages, credit card loans, commercial real estate debt -- all are likely to deteriorate further now that a recession is at hand. Banks that have already lost billions of dollars could lose billions more.
 ''All the danger signs are flashing red,'' said Simon Johnson, a professor at the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
 Much of the fear centers on the unknowable. It is unclear just how bad banks' losses on consumer loans, credit cards and mortgages will be as the economy weakens. Commercial real estate loans are deteriorating, and it is unclear whether banks have sold the worst of their holdings. Then there are all the investments that lurk off of banks' balance sheets, in the so-called shadow banking system. And a new uncertainty has leapt to the forefront as the automotive industry teeters, sending investors scrambling to calculate how much banks are exposed to these loans.
 Several big banks hit record lows. Bank of America fell 13.86 percent to $11.25, JPMorgan slid 17.88 percent to $23.38 and Goldman Sachs slumped 5.76 percent to close at $52. Morgan Stanley neared a record low, closing down 10.24 percent at $9.20, while Wells Fargo fell 7.66 percent to $22.53.
 In a bid to calm nerves, Citigroup officials are meeting with other large shareholders. Last week, Citigroup's chairman, Winfried Bischoff, traveled to Dubai and met with Sheik Ahmed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the director of the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, according to two executives briefed on the situation.
 The renewed assault on financial stocks led the Financial Services Roundtable, an influential lobby group for the industry, to press regulators Thursday for another ban on short-selling, a strategy in which investors bet against declines in a share price.
 The current rout appeared to have gained momentum after Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. announced last week that the government would abandon its original plan to purchase troubled bank assets. That sent prices of commercial mortgage bonds and other loans into a nosedive. Mr. Paulson also said the Treasury would let the incoming administration determine how to deploy the remaining $350 billion left in the program. 
 Yet investors have grown increasingly nervous about the appearance of a leadership vacuum in Washington as the financial markets burn, and some have begun saying that President-elect Barack Obama should move more rapidly to release a plan. 
 ''We really need somebody to step in and show leadership,'' said Wilbur L. Ross Jr., chairman of WL Ross and Company, an investment firm that has been looking for bargains in the banking sector. ''Every day that's wasted and that we stay in freefall is going to make the recession that much deeper and longer.''
 That has workers in the financial industry bracing for more pain. 
 ''Major financial institutions have been taking write-downs all year, and what do you do next? You lay people off, and that decreases your need for office space,'' said Harold Bordwin of the real estate group at KPMG Corporate Finance. ''It's very scary.''

HEADLINE: Miss Palin? Go Visit Her

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
Gov. Sarah Palin is personally inviting Americans from all over the country to visit her home state. Well, sort of. 
 Letters bearing Ms. Palin's picture and written on letterhead from ''Office of the Governor'' have begun reappearing in mailboxes around the country, part of an appeal from the Alaska Travel Industry Association encouraging people to sign up for a free travel guide to the state. 
 The tourism campaign started in August, but it was suspended because of Ms. Palin's vice-presidential candidacy. With the election over, it has begun again. 
 ''This is nothing new that we've been doing,'' said Ron Peck, president of the trade association. Mr. Peck said his organization had been sending out notes from the state's governors for 20 years. 
 Alaska is hardly the only state to give its governor the spotlight. Many other governors have lent their faces to similar campaigns, raising their profiles with the benefit of the free publicity. 
 In Ms. Palin's case, it has worked both ways. Responses to the August mailing rose 20 percent after she was chosen as Senator John McCain's running mate, Mr. Peck said. But he said her star power was not likely to result in a mass pilgrimage to Alaska, given the economy.
 ''Planning for a trip to Alaska sometimes is a year, two years in advance,'' Mr. Peck said. ''So we're excited about the fact that responses are up, but that doesn't necessarily relate to travel.''

HEADLINE: Democrats Oust Longtime Leader Of House Panel

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER; Micheline Maynard contributed reporting from Detroit.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Representative Henry A. Waxman wrested the chairmanship of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee from Representative John D. Dingell on Thursday in a coup that is expected to accelerate passage of energy, climate and health legislation backed by President-elect Barack Obama.
 Mr. Waxman, 69, of California, who mounted a quiet but devastatingly effective two-week campaign against his longtime Democratic colleague, won the chairmanship with a 137-to-122 vote in the Democratic Caucus. The vote was secret, but many allies of Speaker Nancy Pelosi backed Mr. Waxman's move, and several members said they had voted on the assumption that Ms. Pelosi had tacitly approved. 
 Democrats also read the signals coming from the president-elect's transition office, which this week announced the intention to name Philip Schiliro, a longtime aide to Mr. Waxman, as the White House director of Congressional relations.
 The takeover marked the fall of a third long-serving member of Congress in the last two weeks. Senator Ted Stevens, 85, Republican of Alaska, lost his re-election bid after a federal fraud conviction. Senator Robert C. Byrd, 91, Democrat of West Virginia, stepped aside as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee last week. 
 The ouster of Mr. Dingell, of Michigan, was another blow to the reeling American auto industry, which learned Thursday that it would not get any financial assistance from Congress until it showed how it could be profitable again. Mr. Dingell, who represents a suburban Detroit district, has been the industry's most stalwart defender in Congress, having slowed or blocked many safety and environmental standards that the auto companies argued they could not meet.
 Some in the industry quaked at the ascension of Mr. Waxman, whom they consider an ''irrational environmental zealot,'' in the words of David Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. 
 At a meeting of the House Democratic Caucus on Thursday morning, Mr. Dingell and his supporters delivered an impassioned plea to let him keep his post as the senior Democrat on the committee, which he has held for 28 years. But Mr. Waxman's argument that he would be a more vigorous and effective advocate for Mr. Obama's agenda won the day. Mr. Dingell, 82, has been hobbled by health problems and is in a wheelchair recovering from knee-replacement surgery.
 Mr. Waxman described the battle with Mr. Dingell as painful, but praised his rival's half century of service in Congress. Without directly criticizing Mr. Dingell, Mr. Waxman said he would move more quickly on the president-elect's priorities.
 ''I went before the caucus and argued we needed a change in leadership and the public was clamoring for the change,'' Mr. Waxman said in an interview after the vote. He said he hoped to move forward on comprehensive climate and health care legislation, simultaneously if possible.
 ''I think we need to act on both issues even though they're complex and may be contentious,'' Mr. Waxman said. ''When a new president is elected there's often a limited opportunity to get through major bills that he's backed.''
 Mr. Dingell was surrounded by staff members after the vote, some of them in tears, others furious. He did not speak immediately to reporters but issued a statement later recognizing that he had been swept away by brisk winds blowing at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
 ''Well, this was clearly a change year, and I congratulate my colleague Henry Waxman on his success today,'' Mr. Dingell said. ''I will work closely with him on the issues facing the Energy and Commerce Committee and for a smooth transition.''
 Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat completing his first term in Congress, said he and many other new members were sympathetic to Mr. Dingell, but believed it was time for new leadership.
 ''Many of the people who were elected with me didn't come here to serve 30 years,'' said Mr. Yarmuth, 61. ''There is a sense of urgency among many people in my class. We came here to make some dramatic changes.''
 Mr. Waxman represents Santa Monica, Beverly Hills and well-to-do areas of West Los Angeles. He has long championed clean air legislation and measures to strengthen consumer protections. He supports tougher nursing home regulation, increased federal support for disease research and subsidies for prescription drugs for the poor and the elderly.
 As ranking member and chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, he has been Congress's grand inquisitor, conducting high-profile investigations of Wall Street, Major League Baseball, Pentagon contractors and the tobacco industry. He has also served as the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Health.
 As oversight committee chairman, he had a perch to make trouble for the administration and federal agencies. As the new chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, he has a chance to make history as an ambitious new president takes office.
 Mr. Dingell has been the top Democrat on the committee since 1981 and has been in Congress since 1955, winning the seat in a special election after his father died in office. In February, Mr. Dingell will become the longest-serving member in the history of the House. He is married to Deborah Insley Dingell, a longtime senior executive at the General Motors Corporation. 
 Many lawmakers and lobbyists consider the Energy and Commerce Committee to be the most influential panel in either house of Congress, one that handles, by some estimates, all or parts of two-thirds of the legislation moving through the House. Three committees in the Senate share jurisdiction over bills relating to energy, environment and commerce, all of which pass through the single House committee.
 Outside the committee room is a huge NASA photograph of Earth taken from space. Mr. Dingell is fond of pointing to it in answer to questions about his committee's jurisdiction.
 Scott Segal, a lobbyist at Bracewell & Giuliani who represents a variety of energy-related interests, said that industry had no doubt that Mr. Waxman would pursue a more aggressive path on climate change legislation than Mr. Dingell would have. But he also said that, as chairman, Mr. Waxman would be constrained in what he could actually accomplish.
 Mr. Segal said Mr. Waxman would have to carefully weigh the economic impact of any global warming bill he advanced.
 Mr. Segal said a well-written bill could both reduce global warming and create millions of new jobs. ''An improperly crafted bill might scare investment out of the energy sector entirely,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Obama Fund-Raiser Knocks Down Cabinet Rumors

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE; Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
When Barack Obama was looking for an entree into Chicago's elite business community, he had the perfect door-opener: Penny S. Pritzker, a billionaire from one of the city's dynasties.
 Ms. Pritzker, 49, went on to become the Obama presidential campaign's national finance chairwoman, raising record-breaking sums. And after Mr. Obama won the election, she was widely reported to be a leading contender for commerce secretary.
 But the same business holdings and connections that made Ms. Pritzker so vital to Mr. Obama's ability to raise campaign money also came under sharp scrutiny. On Thursday, she released a statement declaring that she would not be a candidate for the job. 
 ''I think I can best serve our nation in my current capacity: building businesses, creating jobs and working to strengthen our economy,'' Ms. Pritzker said. ''It has been my great privilege to serve in the Obama campaign. I look forward to helping our new president in every way possible and am excited about the future under his leadership.''
 Ms. Pritzker is one of three cousins who manage their family's fortune, which includes Hyatt hotels, casinos and other ventures. She oversees a chain of luxury retirement communities, an airport parking company, a realty group and the credit-rating agency TransUnion.
 The talk of a cabinet post, which would require Senate confirmation, had cast a spotlight on her secretive family's empire and her past business dealings, including episodes that might prove politically embarrassing.
 Earlier in her career, Ms. Pritzker was involved in running and overseeing Superior Bank, in a Chicago suburb, which focused on bundling subprime mortgages into securities, the practice that later helped set off the current financial crisis. The institution collapsed in 2001.
 Moreover, Ms. Pritzker's family is renowned for finding ways to avoid paying taxes on its wealth. The Pritzkers were pioneers in using tax loopholes to shelter their holdings from the Internal Revenue Service, and many of their dealings have never been made public.
 It was not clear why she put out the statement on Thursday, but some news outlets, including The New York Times, reported late Wednesday night that she was in the final stages of being vetted. An Obama transition spokesman said Thursday that those accounts were incorrect.
 Burt Ely, a banking consultant who testified at a 2001 Senate committee hearing about the failure of Superior Bank, said it had never made sense for Ms. Pritzker to become a nominee. ''The confirmation hearing could have been quite ugly for all that would have been dredged up about Superior as well as possibly other Pritzker dealings,'' Mr. Ely said Thursday.
 In 1988, the Pritzker family and another wealthy investor took over a failing savings and loan and turned it into Superior Bank. Ms. Pritzker was its chairwoman from 1991 to 1994, after which she sat on the board of the bank's holding company.
 In 1993, the bank began a strategy of concentrating on packaging subprime mortgages into securities. At first, the bank flourished. But regulators later discovered accounting irregularities that overstated the value of its assets. The bank was forced to write down huge losses, leaving it without adequate capital in the spring of 2001.
 In May 2001, Ms. Pritzker wrote a letter to bank employees assuring them that her family would put more cash in to save the bank, and declaring that ''our commitment to subprime lending has never been stronger.'' But the Pritzker family did not carry out the plan, and the bank was shut down in July 2001. 
 A 2002 report by the inspector general of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation concluded that ''the failure of Superior Bank was directly attributable to bank management and the board of directors ignoring sound risk management principles and failing to adequately oversee Superior operations.''
 The Pritzkers agreed in 2001 to pay the F.D.I.C. $460 million over 15 years to cover claims by depositors. Still, more than 1,400 depositors who had more than $100,000 in their savings accounts -- the maximum the government then insured -- were left short about $10 million, said Clint Krislov, a lawyer for several of them. ''Why the Pritzkers wouldn't do the right thing and just make these people whole for the small amount of money that it would take, I still cannot understand,'' he said.
 In a written response to questions by The Times on Thursday, Ms. Pritzker said, ''I sincerely regret the closing of Superior Bank.'' She said that she did not personally own any of the bank, but that her trusts had contributed to the ''large amount of money'' that her family paid to the F.D.I.C.
 The Pritzker clan's fortune traces back to a Chicago law firm run by Ms. Pritzker's grandfather, who bought up property during the Depression and became an investor. His sons expanded the empire, establishing the Hyatt chain.
 The family also increased its wealth by exploiting loopholes in the tax code, including setting up a series of offshore trusts that sheltered their assets from taxes.
 The I.R.S. fought several battles with the Pritzkers over the arrangements. But the agency was hindered by foreign bank secrecy laws that concealed what the Pritzkers owned.
 In 2002, a few cracks appeared in the wall of secrecy when two young Pritzker heirs filed a lawsuit claiming their older relatives had looted their trusts. The litigation revealed that the family was worth at least $15 billion, that it was held in some 950 trusts, and that they were trying to split it up among 11 heirs by 2011. 
 One Democrat familiar with the transition said Thursday that Ms. Pritzker initially believed she could weather questions about Superior Bank, but her family resisted because their assets are so entangled. 
 The transition team's vetting form, which she never filled out, required disclosing all property owned in the past decade, including ''held in trust'' or ''held in combination with others.''

HEADLINE: Talking With the Taliban

 BODY:
Afghanistan's swift unraveling has created new -- and in some quarters unrealistic -- enthusiasm for talks with the Taliban. 
 We agree that there should be a serious effort to win over lower-level militants and tribal leaders -- people who are not true believers but have allied with extremists because they had no choice, needed the money or have grown so disillusioned with the Afghan government that they forgot the horrors of Taliban rule. 
 President-elect Barack Obama has said that he is open to such an approach. Gen. David McKiernan, the top American commander in Afghanistan, says he is working on a plan to engage militants in local councils provided they reject the Taliban and accept the basic civil rights and political freedoms in the Afghan Constitution. 
 At the same time, we are deeply skeptical that there is any deal to be cut with Taliban leaders who gave sanctuary to Al Qaeda before 9/11 and would undoubtedly insist on re-imposing their repressive, medieval ways, including denying education and medical care to women. 
 We fear that some NATO members may be so eager to withdraw their troops that they would be willing to trade away the Afghans' future. Or that the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, may be far too eager to compromise in hopes of increasing his re-election chances. He made aides to Mr. Obama (as well as us) nervous this week with an offer, since rejected, to draw the Taliban leader Mullah Mohammad Omar into negotiations.
 There was real joy in Afghanistan -- and around the world -- when America and its Afghan allies defeated the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Seven years later, both are back with a vengeance. This is the deadliest year for NATO and Afghan forces in Afghanistan since 2001. The country is on a downward spiral, with a breakdown in central authority, rampant corruption, a booming heroin trade and increasingly sophisticated attacks by militants on both sides of the Pakistan border.
 President Bush shortchanged the Afghan war in favor of his disastrous Iraq war. Mr. Karzai is also culpable. His government's venality and ineptitude has driven his people back to the extremists. Mr. Bush has belatedly woken up to the mess he created and sent more -- although still not enough -- troops to Afghanistan. Force alone will not defeat the militants. 
 Afghanistan's only chance is a long-term American commitment that also includes far more economic assistance and support for political development. Washington also must come up with a better mixture of incentives and pressures to persuade Pakistan to shut down havens of the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Mr. Karzai must cut all ties with corrupt officials and clean up and strengthen his national police. 
 Negotiations with tribal leaders and low-level militants also can be part of that strategy. Afghan, Saudi and Pakistani officials should keep probing for interlocutors. For now, the Taliban has all of the momentum. American and NATO forces will have to continue their assault on the insurgents through the winter and make a much greater effort to limit civilian casualties. 
 Instead of leaving it to Mr. Obama, Mr. Bush should quickly authorize the extra 20,000 American troops that his commanders have requested. The United States and its allies also must ensure that Afghanistan has the food aid it needs to compensate for this year's failed harvest. Widespread hunger would drive even more civilians to the Taliban.

HEADLINE: Endowment Drying Up, A Museum Seeks Help

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Faced with a severe financial crisis, officials of the Museum of Contemporary Art have had talks about a possible joint venture or merger with several other Los Angeles institutions, including the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Broad Art Foundation and the University of Southern California.
 The talks come as the museum's endowment, which has been tapped several times in recent years to pay for continuing operations, has shrunk to less than $10 million, one of the lowest levels since the museum's founding in 1979, according to people who have been briefed on the museum's financial situation. 
 The museum's troubles and its search for a rescuer come as museums around the country are tightening their belts because of the global financial downturn. The Museum of Contemporary Art recently announced that it was cutting its budget by about 10 percent and closing its Geffen Contemporary annex -- which accounts for more than half of the museum's exhibition space -- for six months beginning in January. 
 Since the museum's troubles were first reported this week in an article in The Los Angeles Times, museum officials have not spoken publicly about its financial status or possible relief efforts. The museum is not required to release financial statements for its 2008 fiscal year until May 2009.
 In a statement issued after its board met on Wednesday, the museum said it was ''exploring several options, and in doing so talking to many partners in the Los Angeles community.'' All of its options, the statement said, ''entail MOCA retaining its identity, programming and expanding its permanent collection.''
 In the last 18 months, the endowment has fallen to less than $10 million, down from $19.8 million at the end of the 2007 fiscal year and from more than $40 million near the beginning of this decade, according to people who have been briefed on the museum's situation but who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose the figures publicly.
 Eli Broad, the billionaire philanthropist who was a founding chairman of the museum and who has more recently been the largest donor to the Los Angeles County Museum, said in an interview Thursday that he had talked to officials of the contemporary art museum about a potential partnership that would ensure the museum's independence.
 ''Our view and that of our foundation is it should remain an independent institution,'' Mr. Broad said. ''Clearly, the budget's going to have to be reduced. And they are going to have to raise money and beef up the endowment. We want to help them do that.''
 Michael Govan, the director of the Los Angeles County Museum, said he had also talked to the Museum of Contemporary Art about its future. 
 ''There has been a lot of back-and-forth speculating about how we can work together,'' Mr. Govan said, noting that the two institutions ''have been talking for years'' and worked together last year, with Mr. Broad's financial help, to jointly buy a sculpture by Chris Burden.
 Officials of the Museum of Contemporary Art have also approached the University of Southern California about a possible investment. A spokesman for the university said Thursday that ''no proposals are on the table involving U.S.C.'' 
 One arrangement that was discussed involved the university's providing administrative support for the museum, which would maintain its separate financial status. The University of California, Los Angeles, has a similar arrangement with the Hammer Museum. 
 The museum has also said that it intends to step up its efforts to raise new money from donors, a plan that could be hindered by the current economic environment.

HEADLINE: Cries for More Intervention, but So Far in Vain

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris's blog on finance and economics is at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
As Americans await the arrival of a new administration in Washington, investors are worrying whether the financial system is again in the danger zone. 
 With the stock market plunging and the credit market entering a new freeze, cries are being heard for a new government intervention to prop up major financial institutions before President-elect Barack Obama takes office.
 ''We can't get from here to Feb. 1 if the current 'who's in charge?' situation continues,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, an investment firm, arguing that Congress should adopt a stimulus package, including temporary tax cuts, as rapidly as possible. Instead, he said, Washington seems paralyzed. 
 This week Citigroup's already depressed shares have lost half their value, and shares of Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase are down 30 percent. 
 Those declines have come despite reassuring comments from Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., who told National Public Radio a week ago that people were no longer worried about the possibility of a major bank failure. ''I've got to tell you,'' he said. ''I think our major institutions have been stabilized. I believe that very strongly.''
 The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell by more than 6 percent on two consecutive days, Wednesday and Thursday, something that had not happened since July 20 and 21, 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, when panic was brought on by collapsing commodity prices. Such prices have fallen rapidly this week as well, as evidence mounted of a world recession. The index is now at its lowest level in 11 years.
 By resigning from the Senate before the current session began and allowing it to appear that a sense of drift could prevail until he is inaugurated, Mr. Obama may have missed an opportunity to exert leadership.
 The renewed sell-off in the stock market this week has been stunning, with some of the worst declines coming in the financial stocks and the shares of retailers. The credit markets are again shaky, with junk bond yields soaring.
 In retrospect, the decision to let Lehman Brothers fail had devastating consequences, and not just to the financial system. Shares of some major retailers -- for which the season now beginning is critical -- have lost nearly three-quarters of their value since that mid-September decision. 
 There is fear of a wave of corporate bankruptcies that will strain banks' balance sheets and make them even more hesitant to make the loans that could keep struggling companies alive.
 A stimulus package is needed quickly, said Gerald Holtham, a British economist and hedge fund manager, but for it to be effective a way will have to be found to revive credit markets, and to assure that tax cuts have an economic impact greater than would come from simply enabling overleveraged consumers to pay down their credit card balances.
 The vast majority of last spring's stimulus package, in the form of tax rebate checks, was saved rather than spent, a fact that left some economists complaining that the rebates had little bang for the buck.
 Mr. Holtham suggested that the government should pay for the stimulus, as well as the bailout, by issuing short-term Treasury bills rather than longer-term notes or bonds. Because of the flight to safety, Treasury bills now offer yields of well under 1 percent, while five-year Treasuries pay about 2 percent.
 He said he feared that banks would buy Treasuries, if they could, rather than making loans.
 ''You don't want the banks to have a lot of three, four and five-year Treasuries to buy'' with the money they get from a new round of bailouts and from people paying down credit card debts, he said. If only low-yielding bills are issued by the government, ''the banks will have an incentive to find private-sector creditworthy borrowers.''
 Traditionally, recessions have been caused by the Federal Reserve raising interest rates, and they end after the Fed concludes that inflation is under control and eases up. But this recession can be attributed to the opposite -- excessively loose monetary policy that helped to encourage the credit bubble in which loans made to all manner of poor risks, whether they were overleveraged companies or subprime mortgage borrowers.
 Now there is worry that the Fed will have difficulty ending a recession that it never intended to produce, and that it did not see coming until well after the economy began to slow. 
 Since Lehman failed, the Fed has cut the federal funds rate in half, to 1 percent. The yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has fallen from 3.8 percent to 3 percent, but the rates charged on home mortgages have risen, even for highly qualified borrowers. And the KDP High Yield Index, a measure of the cost of loans for companies with poor credit, has risen from under 11 percent to over 17 percent.
 Economic activity, whether in spending by individuals or businesses, seemed to dry up after the Lehman failure, and it has shown little sign of reviving. Target, the discount department store chain, said this week that sales in the first part of November were below already modest expectations, and hinted that December sales were likely to be below those of a year ago.
 ''Tightening of credit across all credit card issuers has already had a very important adverse effect on our sales, and I'm sure it will continue to do so,'' said Douglas A. Scovanner, Target's chief financial officer. He said Target had cut back on orders for the holiday season, but still has ''some concerns about clearance markdown exposure, given what might happen here in fourth-quarter sales.''
 To make things worse, the number of regions with problems is growing. The worst areas, both in terms of credit losses and sales declines, were concentrated in areas with the weakest real estate markets -- Arizona, Florida, Nevada and parts of California. ''I'd probably add a few to that list,'' Mr. Scovanner said. ''Certainly, Georgia and the Carolinas, Tennessee are much less healthy than they once were. And Michigan, Ohio is another area that is very unhealthy.''
 Target shares have lost more than half their value since Lehman failed, and that is much better than many of its competitors have done. Shares in Macy's, Sears, Saks, Nordstrom, AnnTaylor and Dillard's are down more than 70 percent as this holiday season approaches.
 October was the worst month ever for the S.& P.'s index of retail stocks, with a 17 percent decline. But anyone who thought things could not get worse was wrong. The index is down 29 percent more this month. Even shares in Wal-Mart, whose sales have risen as consumers trade down, are off 19 percent since the Lehman failure.
 The common wisdom is that some people who want to shop may have trouble borrowing, and that others will stare at their 401(k) statements and decide this is not the year to spend. They will wonder if their jobs are really safe, and worry that their homes are worth less than they owe.
 The gallows humor of this time was brought home to me by a reader who told me he no longer felt badly about having stopped renting and instead buying a home in 2006. Sure the house has lost value, he said, but if he had not bought it, he would have left his money in the stock market and be even worse off now.
 Despite the bailouts, people are worried that more financial institutions will run into big problems. Even mighty Berkshire Hathaway, Warren E. Buffett's Triple-A rated company whose largest business is insurance, seems to arouse doubts. The cost of insuring against a Berkshire default leaped this month, as the stock fell to a five-year low. 
 Since the Lehman weekend, Berkshire has lost 35 percent of its value, which means it has performed better than most. The S.& P.'s 500-stock index is down 40 percent, and the S.& P. financial index has lost more than half of its value, which was severely depressed before the fall. It is now at a 13-year low.
 In a speech Thursday at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif., Mr. Paulson defended the decision to let Lehman fail, saying he had no legal authority to prevent it. ''Some have chosen to scapegoat the Lehman failure as the cause of the deepening crisis in September, as opposed to a symptom,'' he said. ''That is at best naive, and at worst disingenuous.''
 He is right that Lehman's problems were a symptom of the crisis, but the government's inability or unwillingness to prevent the failure added a new level of fear to already shaken markets.
 The recession is clearly going to last for many more months, and the unwinding of excessive borrowing, whether by consumers or companies, has a long way to go. But some of the latest plunge might be reversed if there were a sense that, this time, the government was going to act quickly and decisively.
 Even without that, it is possible that the financial market meltdown overstates the real woes being felt in the rest of the country. It presumably is less of a shock in Peoria than in Greenwich that top investment bankers will get no bonuses, or that Citigroup will fire tens of thousands.
 The fate of the retailers this year is unlikely to be improved by a surge in sales, but it could be helped if it turns out the retailers were generally conservative in ordering products, and do not have to slash prices too broadly to unload unwanted inventory.
 They were showing caution, which is one reason imports began to fall earlier this year. If the October trade report, to be released two weeks before Christmas, shows a sharp decline in imports, that will both confirm the existence of a deep recession and provide evidence that the retailers may have been wiser than investors now fear.
 For now, though, the fear is that the economy is deteriorating much more rapidly than the government thought possible. In late October, the Federal Reserve board staff concluded that the unemployment rate was likely to rise as high as 6.5 percent by the end of this year. A few days later, the Labor Department reported it was already there, with two months left to go.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Softens Tone In Rebate Check Dispute

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
A day after defiantly asserting that the city could not afford to send out $400 rebate checks to homeowners, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg struck a far softer tone on Thursday, saying he would cooperate with the City Council, which has been urging him to release the checks.
 ''There's nobody who would like to send a check to every homeowner in this city more than me,'' the mayor told reporters at a news conference after appearing at a luncheon on Staten Island. 
 Still, there was no word from the mayor's office or from Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn about when the checks would be distributed.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg touched off intense criticism from council members who said he was insensitive to New Yorkers who have been waiting for the money to help pay bills or buy Christmas presents. The rebates are typically sent out in October.
 ''We obviously aren't going to send out checks when we don't have the money,'' Mr. Bloomberg said Wednesday. He has argued that withholding the checks would save the city about $250 million -- much needed cash as the city confronts an economic downturn.
 But on Thursday he seemed more conciliatory and said he did not relish the idea of denying people the money.
 ''It's not easy to stand up and say: 'Look, we just don't have the money,' or 'We're not really sure that we have the money,' '' he said.
 The issue of the rebate checks, which are usually sent to each owner of a house, condominium or co-op, has created a public embarrassment for Mr. Bloomberg. This year, city employees told residents in October that a technical problem prevented the distribution of the checks, but that they would be sent eventually. Then in early November, the mayor said he had decided that his administration would not send them out at all because of fiscal constraints.
 On Monday, the City Council forced administration officials to admit that the mayor did not have the legal authority to withhold the checks because they were part of the budget for this fiscal year, approved by the Council and signed by the mayor.
 Still, as of Thursday, the city's 311 operators were telling homeowners who called looking for their rebates, ''Due to budget constraints, rebate checks will not be issued.''
 Some council members suspect that Mr. Bloomberg is stalling on the release of the checks so he can use them to bargain during budget negotiations with the Council in the coming weeks. Mr. Bloomberg seemed to hint at that in his remarks to reporters Thursday.
 ''We're going to reach an agreement not just on the rebate, but on property taxes and all sorts of other revenue enhancements and efficiencies that we have to have,'' the mayor said.
 Four council members sued the administration earlier this week, demanding the checks be mailed out immediately. 
 Asked whether his administration would make the payments now if directed to by a court, he spoke forcefully, saying: ''We're a nation of laws. Have you ever seen me or our administration not follow the law?''
 But he added, ''We're going to have to work together with the speaker, with her staff, with all of the council members, and we'll do everything we can to continue to find the right balance. Together, we'll work out all of this, and I'm confident we'll come to an agreement.''

HEADLINE: In Big-City Din, A Chance to Hear

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY

 BODY:
IN BIG-CITY DIN,
A Chance to Hear
Sometimes it takes a city to heal a child.
On Friday, Nabu Ndiaye, 8, from Senegal, received a cochlear implant so she could hear again, after meningitis left her deaf at age 3. The cast of characters who worked to bring her here includes a former city official, a teacher and a classroom of Bronx children. 
Nabu's father, Cherif Ndiaye (the ''d'' is silent), is a part-time tour guide who supports his wife, mother, two children and several siblings.
One of his clients is the American Jewish World Service, an international development group run by Ruth W. Messinger, the former Manhattan borough president. When workers with the group met Mr. Ndiaye's family, they dedicated themselves to helping Nabu hear again.
One of them, Amy Alter, who teaches at Public School 105 in the Bronx, met Nabu four years ago. When she tried teaching her sign language, ''she just gobbled it up,'' Ms. Alter said.
To make it all happen, Ms. Messinger gathered support from Dr. Darius Kohan, a surgeon; Advanced Bionics, an implant manufacturer; and Allan Fine, a vice president at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, where the surgery was done. Ms. Alter asked her students to contribute clothing for visitors who were used to a much more temperate climate.
Father and daughter arrived last Saturday. Given hearing aids to try, Mr. Ndiaye recalled, ''She was jumping, dancing, as if to say, 'Don't take the things off.' ''
Ms. Messinger said her charity work was a welcome change. Helping Nabu, she said, was an extension of her work in developing villages: ''It's an unusual opportunity to take it down to the next level and pull together people who are prepared to make a difference for one child.''
Meanwhile, Nabu will need to return to New York every three to six months in the coming years to be trained to hear, an expensive proposition.
But Mr. Ndiaye sees a bright future. ''I'm overwhelmed,'' he said, sitting in a waiting room during her three-hour operation. ''I'm surrounded by wonderful people.'' TINA KELLEY

HEADLINE: Harmful Lending Practices

 BODY:
One of the questions lurking beneath the surface of the national debate over the mortgage crisis, which has placed six million Americans at risk of losing their homes this year and next, is who is to blame. 
 Clearly, reckless bankers, feckless regulators and greedy traders in the shadowy derivatives market must take a major share of responsibility for the current financial mess. But how much blame should be placed on the shoulders of the people who bought homes with mortgages they could not afford, or with complicated and confusing repayment schemes that threaten them with sharply higher interest rates and mushrooming monthly payments?
 Some measure of personal accountability is clearly warranted, but federal regulators could have done a great deal to avert this crisis by reining in lenders, rather than standing by while mortgage companies corralled millions of people into risky, high-cost loans they could never hope to repay. Bankers, brokers and appraisers all worked to inflate property values, and the resulting loans were repackaged and sold to Wall Street.
 Lawmakers, for their part, missed important chances to curtail some of these problems last year as the scale of the crisis was becoming apparent. The House and Senate both failed to pass important bills into law. The Congress that takes office in January must revisit and strengthen last year's proposals. 
 The House actually managed to pass the Mortgage Reform and Anti-Predatory Lending Act last fall. Soon thereafter, Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, introduced a similar but stronger bill in the Senate. It remains there, bottled up in committee. 
 Both bills would require a return to prudent mortgage-lending policies -- including setting minimum standards intended to ensure that people can actually repay the loans they take out. 
 The Senate bill goes farther than the House bill in holding both mortgage originators and people to whom they sell their loans liable in cases where an illegal loan was made. The risk of being sued would discourage Wall Street and others from dealing with fly-by-night originators, building accountability into a securitization system that currently has very little.
 Consumer advocacy groups have rightly advised Congress to adopt the consumer protections laid out in both bills -- while adopting the stronger liability provision of the Senate version. It will not be easy to move forward on these bills. But they are part of what Congress must to do make sure the country does not find itself facing the same disastrous problem down the road.

HEADLINE: Make Veterans a Priority

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Regarding your Nov. 18 front-page article ''Newest Veterans Hit Hard by Economic Crisis'': 
 Let me get this straight. We send our men and women into the most dangerous places and situations so that we can be secure and safe. 
 In doing their job, they give up their financial well-being, health, sanity and even their lives. 
 We thank them by ignoring their medical needs and disregarding their financial challenges. 
 We simply cut them loose to swim or sink on their own. 
 Shame on us! To foreclose on a veteran's home is disgraceful and unconscionable. A government that permits this should be held liable for neglect. 
 I do not care how or where we have to find the money. Our veterans should be on top of our priority list.

HEADLINE: If Bankruptcy Hits Detroit

 BODY:
Congress has given Detroit's flailing automakers less than two weeks to come up with a restructuring plan that would justify giving them tens of billions of taxpayer dollars and ensure that they have a reasonable path back to profitability. We hope it is a good plan, because the lame-duck Congress does not have a choice. 
 Michigan's three car manufacturers have said that they would go bankrupt this year without an infusion of taxpayers' money. Failing to provide it would be a truly irresponsible act that could obliterate one or more companies, potentially causing other bankruptcies and costing many hundreds of thousands of jobs. 
 Unpalatable as it seems to underwrite the proven record of failure of Detroit's automakers, Congress must provide sufficient money to shore them up until the Obama administration takes office. Then, the new president and new Congress can decide how to manage either a rescue package with tight strings attached or a bankruptcy process that ensures the fallen companies have a reasonable shot at picking up the pieces.
 Bankruptcy proceedings are designed to allow ailing companies to be restructured into profitable businesses, but that is by no means guaranteed -- and it requires infusions of credit. 
 In the current financial environment, where even the soundest companies are having trouble getting loans, the government would have to guarantee that financing is available so that any car company under bankruptcy protection could keep operating and paying its workers and suppliers while it is restructured.
 A bankrupt carmaker would face another tricky problem: how to keep consumers from shunning its cars out of fear that it might not be around to honor its warranty. Any bankruptcy financing given to a car company should be enough to buy warranty insurance to cover its fleet. 
 None of this guarantees an orderly restructuring. A company in bankruptcy proceedings could try to avoid making tough choices and coast through on the government dime. Insuring warranties might create an incentive for the company and its workers to relax on quality control. But these concerns might be addressed by tying worker and executive incentives to car quality and establishing a ceiling for government bankruptcy credit.
 To get America's carmakers back on their feet, difficult choices will have to be made -- including cutting labor costs and the cost of health insurance. That is likely to mean selling off some product lines, laying off workers and closing the least productive plants. It could mean renegotiating the deal with the auto workers' union to pay billions into a fund to cover retiree medical costs. 
 Taxpayers will end up with a big liability even if the company turns around and is able to repay its debt to the government. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is required to cover a substantial portion of the underfunded pension liabilities of any bankrupt company. 
 Economists Luigi Zingales and Joshua Rauh of the University of Chicago estimated that if General Motors were to collapse, underfunded pension liabilities would cost taxpayers roughly $23 billion.
 It would still be our choice that the restructuring of blundering auto companies occur in an orderly way and be combined with a national strategy to deliver more fuel-efficient cars. Congress, so far, has failed in its duty to help make that happen. What must be avoided at all costs is for a big car company to spiral into liquidation.

HEADLINE: Mounting Woes at Citigroup Began With Bank's Failed Bid for Wachovia

BYLINE: By BEN WHITE and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
Less than two months ago, Citigroup emerged from the wreckage of the financial crisis as one of the last titans left standing on Wall Street. 
 Now, in a stunning turnabout, the banking giant has sunk to its knees after a series of blows that have driven its stock price to a mere $3.77 on Friday -- and left it running short on time and options. 
 In the decade since Citigroup was born from the merger of Citicorp and Travelers Group, it weathered many storms that threatened to pull it apart. But the current turmoil can be traced back to the last weekend of September, when it sought to reassert itself by swallowing Wachovia, the stricken bank based in Charlotte, N.C., whose vast deposit base would have turned Citi into one of America's dominant lenders. 
 As the global financial crisis drove Wachovia toward collapse, the government frantically engineered their marriage. At a bargain price of $1 a share, Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroup's chief executive, was happy to oblige: The deal would have greatly enhanced Citi's retail banking presence and added more stable consumer deposits to a balance sheet staggered by billions in write-downs on bad mortgage loans and related securities. 
 But like so many other things for Citigroup over the last several years, it fell apart. Less than a week later, Wells Fargo, the powerful San Francisco-based bank, swooped in with a higher offer. Citi was left in the lurch, without a business that was vital to its future. 
 That collapse began a steady decline in Citigroup shares that snowballed this week as speculation grew that the bank might require a government bailout, a forced merger that would crush common equity holders, or an ouster of Mr. Pandit.
 In the last five days alone, more than half of Citigroup's market value was vaporized, and investors and analysts intensified calls for the bank to find ways to lift its stock price, including splitting the company, selling pieces or selling itself outright. 
 ''They don't have the sovereign wealth funds or other big investors to turn to anymore,'' said William Fitzpatrick, an equity analyst for Optique Capital Management. ''There are two remaining options: a federally forced merger or nationalization.'' 
 The bank has fought back vigorously with assertions that its capital position is strong. It announced plans Monday to cut costs and slash 52,000 jobs. On Thursday, Saudi Prince Walid bin Talal, Citi's biggest individual shareholder, said he would increase his stake in the bank to 5 percent from 4 percent. 
 But none of that has appeased investors, some of whom believe Citigroup must raise $20 billion or more in new capital to offset expected losses -- and may have trouble doing so.
 To some extent, Citigroup's fortunes have declined as the storm in the broader financial industry has grown angrier. 
 Many analysts argue that the globe-spanning conglomerate, largely built by Sanford I. Weill, had never really worked as a cohesive unit. Different divisions have consistently battled, and promised synergies between units have rarely emerged. 
 ''They never spent the time, the money or the energy to integrate all of the businesses,'' said Meredith Whitney, analyst at Oppenheimer. ''And so the credit card business speaks Mandarin while the mortgage business speaks Cantonese. It's not a functional family. And because it's not a functional family, it's extraordinarily expensive to operate all the separate businesses, and you don't get any of the advantages.''
 Many of these problems were masked during the credit boom this decade. But with the financial crisis in full swing, the bank's failure to unite its empire has become more exposed than ever. 
 ''A lot of the issues facing Citigroup are not new issues, they have simply grown greater in severity,'' said Michael Mayo, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. 
 These strains intensified significantly in recent days, when a near three-week grace period in financial markets came to an abrupt halt. Credit markets had begun to thaw as a $700 billion bailout for the financial industry took effect, and the United States presidential elections breathed a temporary euphoria into markets worldwide. 
 But financial stocks came under renewed assault last week after Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said the agency was abandoning its plan to buy troubled assets from banks -- including the likes of Citigroup. While the program was not a panacea for the banking industry's ills, investors had been expecting the government to absorb vast amounts of troubled assets from bank balance sheets, putting the companies on the path toward financial health. 
 The price of these securities had seen a nascent recovery in late October and early November as investors awaited more details about the plan. Policy makers had suggested the government would have paid higher prices for the securities than they could fetch on the open market, something that would have helped reduce the financial pressure on Citigroup.
 Allen L. Sinai, president of Decision Economics in New York, said that while the original plan to buy assets was poorly conceived, the decision to scrap it severely damaged banks like Citigroup that were holding billions of dollars of mortgage-related assets.
 Now ''those balance sheets will continue to contract as long as housing prices continue to go down,'' said Mr. Sinai. ''What the flip-flopping has done is put another nail in some of our financial institutions.''
 Investors pounded financial shares further as continued dire news about consumers and unemployment made clear that banks will face larger losses on consumer loans, as well as the prospect of billions more in mortgage-related write-downs. While financial shares fell across the board, Citigroup, with its large costs and troubled holdings, quickly became viewed as the most vulnerable, spurring huge sell-offs that worsened as hedge funds bet on a decline in its stock. 
 Then, on Tuesday, a report about imminent defaults on two large commercial mortgages sent the price of bonds backed by those loans tumbling. The first $209 million loan was backed by two Westin hotels in Arizona and Hilton Head, S.C., and the second was a $125 million loan backed a shopping complex in Southern California.
 These problems renewed fears that a vast wave of damaged commercial loans would course through banks -- including Citigroup -- already hit by a tsunami of toxic mortgage products.

HEADLINE: Unable to Sell Homes, Elderly Forgo Move to Assisted Living

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
The housing crisis has kept thousands of older Americans who need support and care from moving into retirement communities or assisted-living centers, effectively stranding them in their own homes.
 Without selling their houses or condominiums, many cannot buy into retirement homes that require a payment of $100,000 to $500,000 just to move in. So they are scratching themselves off waiting lists, canceling plans with packing services and staying put, in houses that fit well 30 years ago, but over the years have become lonely, too large or too treacherous to navigate.
 ''It is part of the hidden problem of the recession,'' said Larry Minnix, president of the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging. ''Every neighborhood, every family's got them.''
 Facilities that have watched their waiting lists wither and their occupancy rates fall in the last year are now scrambling to bring people through their doors. Some assisted-living centers have called in real estate agents to teach prospective residents about online advertising and how to clean and preen their homes for showings. Others have set up programs with banks to provide bridge loans to homeowners, or are discounting apartments and offering low-interest loans. 
 The Cedar Community, which provides a range of housing for the elderly in West Bend, Wis., has seen independent-living occupancy rates drop by 4 percent this year. There were so many people waiting for their homes to sell that the facility decided, in some cases, to let new residents pay month-to-month until they could unload their houses and use the proceeds on the facility's entry deposit.
 ''We've never done that before,'' said Tracey MacGregor, a spokeswoman at Cedar Community. 
 But for people like Ruth Scher, 85, selling their home is a critical first step before moving on, or moving anywhere. Ms. Scher put her two-bedroom condominium in Delray Beach, Fla., on the market last year, but no one has made an offer.
 In the 34 years since she moved to South Florida, Ms. Scher's husband has died, the siblings who moved south from New York to join her have died, and her friends have moved away. She is recovering from a fall that broke her clavicle and suffers from arthritis in one shoulder, and she says it is time to move back.
 ''It's lonesome,'' Ms. Scher said. ''So many other people have passed away or moved away. It's very lonely. The children would love me to come up and I would love to, but I just can't sell.''
 Ms. Scher hoped to move to a retirement community in Cornwall, N.Y., where she has friends. But in the year her home sat on the market, she could not even find a broker willing to sell the property, she said. She finally de-listed her condominium.
 ''They tell you, 'We're sorry, we can't get any people to come and look,' '' Ms. Scher said. ''If I can't sell here, I can't go nowhere.''
 There is no way to say how many older Americans are in similar straits, as no statistics track how many of America's 4.27 million unsold homes are owned by people 65 or older. But industry groups and administrators at retirement homes call the problem a growing one, which worsened as the financial crisis spread from real estate to lending markets. It has been felt worst in regions hit hardest by the housing bust.
 ''It remains to be seen whether we have a short-term stress, or whether we're facing a crisis,'' said Mr. Minnix, of the Association of Homes and Services for the Aging. ''We're into brand new territory here. It is deeper and potentially broader.''
 Across the country, occupancy rates for independent and assisted-living facilities have fallen slightly in the last year, by about 2 percent through the middle of 2008, according to the National Investment Center for the Seniors Housing and Care Industry. 
 But the problem is playing out acutely in hard-hit areas like Florida, where the vacancy rate at some facilities is up 20 percent to 30 percent over last year, said Paul Williams, director of government relations for the Assisted Living Federation of America. At Luther Manor, a retiree community in Milwaukee, the number of residents moving into independent living has dropped 20 percent this year. In southern Ohio, 65 percent of the people who visited the Bristol Village retirement community this year said they could not buy a unit because their homes were still hanging around their necks.
 For these businesses, each occupied room generates thousands of dollars each year. Retirement condos charge monthly fees ranging from a few hundred dollars to $5,000, while the average price for private-pay care in assisted living is $3,013 per month, or $36,156 per year, according to a MetLife study.
 At the Crosby Commons assisted-living center in Shelton, Conn., where waiting lists that once ran two years or more have shrunk to six months, some residents who moved before selling their homes are spending through their savings as they wait, said Lois Poultney, the center's director. One resident had to move from Crosby's free-market homes to its subsidized rent-controlled apartments, Ms. Poultney said. 
 ''I'm hearing it over and over again: 'Mom needs to sell her house before she can afford to move in,' '' she said.
 There are signs some families and retirees are turning to adult day care services as a stopgap. Providers say their business has spiked as people look for an alternative to continuing care or home aides to provide food, companionship and therapeutic services. But Mr. Williams of the Assisted Living Federation said that people who need more day-to-day care, those who have trouble getting up stairs or who need someone to check on them, were taking a risk by staying at home.
 ''When they're coming in at 85, they're coming in very frail and needing services,'' he said. ''They can't wait this out. They need the care when they need the care. That's the scary part. You have people putting it off when they need care right now.''
 For Katherine Styberg, 84, that moment of realization came when she slipped on a patch of ice in February and fractured a vertebra. She has to use a cane when she walks now, and she says she has been thinking about how she lives alone, and if she fell in her two-bedroom condominium in Milwaukee, no one could catch her or help her up. 
 The real estate broker calls Ms. Styberg a day before bringing potential buyers to see her apartment, and a few have come to look around, but no one has made an offer yet. 
 As parents linger in their homes, they say their children start to worry. Some adult children are even facing financial hardships if they cannot sell their parents' homes. 
 In April, Ruth Swessel, 84, of Milwaukee, had a stroke that aggravated the effects of her aging, leaving her unable to follow ''Meet the Press'' or read the political magazines she once loved. Her daughter, Laura Westling, had to put her into skilled care, and the family began the process of selling Ms. Swessel's house to pay for the facility's $60,000 annual cost.
 The house has been sitting on the market since the summer, and Ms. Swessel's family has lowered the price twice, to $174,500 from $189,900, but they have not been able to close a deal. Her children are spending her investments to pay for her care, but Ms. Westling said they did not know what they would do once that money ran out.
 ''It's not easy,'' she said.
 As stock markets have slid in the last year, homes have become a more critical source of wealth for retirees who have watched their mutual funds and 401(k) accounts hollow out. Next to accrued Social Security benefits, housing is the single greatest asset for people 60 to 70 years old,making up 22 percent of their total wealth and outweighing investments and pensions, according to the Center for Retirement Research. For retirees like Herman McHan, who watched the value of his mutual funds fall to $35,000, from $70,000, or Sylvia Merlin, whose portfolio has lost nearly $200,000 of value, owning an interminably on-the-market home compounds the worries of their dwindling investments.
 For Ms. Merlin, it is a disconcerting place to be at age 93. She said she and her late husband, Al, had lived modestly to raise their four children, taking one vacation a year, to the Jersey Shore. She is on oxygen now, and finds it harder to get around her fifth-floor apartment outside of Philadelphia. The doorman's wife takes her to the hairdresser on Fridays, but Ms. Merlin said she wanted more consistent care.
 ''I'm going to be 94, and I need help,'' she said. ''Making the bed is difficult. I need a little help taking a shower. Those things are difficult. I was a great cook, but I really don't cook anymore. I bought the TV dinners, and they're pretty lousy.''
 No one has made an offer on her condominium, and Ms. Merlin said the retirement home had refunded the $1,000 deposit on the $130,000 unit she hoped to buy. Now, instead of moving, she said she had decided to stay.
 ''I just couldn't go anywhere until I sold my apartment,'' she said. ''I and a lot of other oldsters are stuck.''

HEADLINE: And You Thought 1931 Was Bad for the Market

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at nytimes.com/norris.

 BODY:
THIS is shaping up as the year when almost nothing went up. 
 Even after Friday's large stock market rally, only 10 of the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500, the premier American stock index, are higher than they were at the end of 2007, and the index itself is down almost as far as it was in the worst year it ever experienced, at the height of the Great Depression. 
 Although the accompanying charts focus on the United States, similar things can be said in most markets. Only a handful of European stocks are up this year, and within the once buoyant Chinese and Indian stock markets, there are almost no stocks showing gains.
 There has, in other words, been nowhere to hide from the collapse of 2008.
 The ubiquity of the problems reflects how integrated the international financial system has become, as well as the fact that most of the world is now in recession or getting close to it.
 Moreover, many asset prices were pumped up in years past by excessive debt, and are now falling as many investors choose to, or are forced to, reduce their borrowing.
 Standard & Poor's has been keeping statistics on the breadth of the 500 stocks in the index only since 1980. Until now, 2001 was the worst year on record in that regard, when just 131 of them rose. But unless there is a substantial year-end rally, that figure could be 10 times the one for 2008. 
 One measure of the depth of the market malaise is that there are as many stocks in the S.& P. 500 that have declined by 90 percent this year -- 10 -- as there are stocks that have risen at all. Several of the winners, among them Rohm & Haas, the chemical company, and UST, the maker of snuff tobacco, are up only because they agreed to all-cash takeovers early in the year. Their acquirers are down sharply.
 So far this month, the figures are little better. Just 24 of the stocks in the index are up. S.& P. has been keeping track of the monthly figures only since 1999. Until this year, the lowest number rising in a month was 56 in September 2002 -- just before the last bear market ended. That number was challenged in September of this year, when 65 rose, and shattered last month, when just 28 of the 500 stocks showed gains.
 The S.& P. 500 has lost more than a third of its value in a calendar year only twice before, both during the Great Depression. It fell 41.9 percent in 1931, and 38.6 percent in 1937. The worst post-Depression year, until now, was 1974, when the index fell 29.7 percent amid the worst postwar recession the country has yet seen. 
 But this year, the index is down 45.5 percent. Amazingly enough, it has done better than leading indexes in many other countries, at least when currency changes are filtered out. 
 Measured in dollars, the leading indexes in Britain, France, Germany, Canada, China, India, Australia, Brazil and Mexico have all lost more than half their value. Japan's leading index is down almost 50 percent in yen, but just 40 percent in dollars because of the rise of the yen this year.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Will 2008 Be the Worst Year?: For the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, the decline so far in 2008 is among the worst ever in terms of percentage, and it seems likely to be the worst in terms of the number of stocks advancing in the more than 25 years that statistic has been kept.(Sources: Standard & Poor's

HEADLINE: Colombia, Trade and Human Rights

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Pass the Colombian Trade Pact'' (editorial, Nov. 18):
 You argue that rejecting the United States-Colombia free trade agreement ''would send a dismal message to allies the world over that the United States is an unreliable partner.''
 But the most dismal message we could send is that we are not concerned by the egregious and systematic violence against Colombian workers, near-total impunity for the perpetrators of that violence, and the failure of President Alvaro Uribe's government to reform its labor laws. 
 Workers in Colombia face credible threats of death and violence against themselves and family members when they organize a union or try to bargain collectively for a better life. More than half of Colombians live in poverty. The Uribe administration has done far too little to discourage the violence and remove legal obstacles to organizing.
 While the violence is down from historical highs, union murders were actually higher in 2008 than in 2007. Repeated threats by government officials against human rights defenders have contributed to the deteriorating situation.
 Congress is right to reject this agreement. We should not sign a trade agreement with a country that is unable or unwilling to protect the lives of workers exercising their fundamental human rights. John J. Sweeney President, A.F.L.-C.I.O. Washington, Nov. 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Facing the resistance of a democratic Congress and under domestic pressure to obtain approval of the Colombian trade pact, President Alvaro Uribe broke a tradition of impunity by dismissing 27 soldiers and officers, including three generals, allegedly involved in the production of ''false positives,'' a macabre practice of killing civilians and dressing their bodies in camouflage to claim credit for success in fighting leftist guerrillas.
 The Leahy Law, intended to prevent United States assistance to military units involved in violation of human rights, has been widely ineffective.
 Withholding the passing of the Colombian free trade agreement until effective action is taken has conveyed the message that the United States does care about human rights and stands for what it preaches. 
 Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr., an architect of Plan Colombia, a 10-year-old program of military cooperation with Colombia, will be the more credible influence to push the proper decision at the proper time in this regard.
 Arturo Archila Tenafly, N.J., Nov. 18, 2008
 The writer, a medical doctor and medical director of Catholic Charities, New Jersey, was human rights assistant to President Virgilio Barco, 1986-88.
 To the Editor:
 Bravo to The Times for defending the free trade agreement with Colombia.
 There had been talk of a quid pro quo in which Democrats would approve such an agreement in return for government aid to the auto industry. The idea has merit, but the irony here is that Colombia is a nation that is emerging from the darkness and has embraced its future without self-pity or denial. The converse of the Detroit Three, some would say!
 Paul Grisanti Greenwich, Conn., Nov. 19, 2008
 To the Editor:
 ''Pass the Colombian Trade Pact'' urges Congress to pass this free trade deal because walking away ''would alienate many people in Colombia and undermine Washington's credibility.''
 The economic crisis has profoundly changed United States relations with Latin American countries, including Colombia. How can ''free market'' solutions be imposed on Colombian people -- or any other Latin American society -- by the same bankers and politicians who have suddenly embraced government bailouts? And how would pursuing such discredited neoliberal policies give ''credibility'' to Washington? 
 The election of Barack Obama has also transformed United States relations with Latin American countries. In a few short weeks, an Obama administration will have the opportunity to rebuild respectful multilateral relationships in the hemisphere. It is much more likely that rushing to pass this deal in the midst of an economic meltdown and United States political transition would alienate Colombians.
 Altha Cravey Chapel Hill, N.C., Nov. 18, 2008
 The writer is an associate professor of geography and Latin American studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
 To the Editor:
 I agree on the points you made in favor of the United States-Colombia free trade agreement. Let me add another point: genuine concerns over human rights should lead to promoting trade and economic performance. A reverse rationale flows against common sense, and lends a hand to interest groups that want to restore the ill-bred state of affairs that years ago placed Colombia on the brink of disaster. 
 Colombia is still far from being a model state. But let it keep moving in the right direction.
 Miguel Ricaurte-Lombana Bogota, Colombia, Nov. 18, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 Ecuadoreans respect Colombia's decision to enter into free trade agreements, but fail to see how discussions of the bilateral Colombia-United States free trade agreement involve Ecuador.
 To illustrate your pro-free trade agreement position for an important ally in a volatile corner of South America, you refer to Ecuador's decision not to renew a United States military lease for Manta Air Base. Yet Colombia and other neighboring countries have also denied United States requests for bases.
 Ecuador's foreign minister qualified United States-Ecuador relations as excellent, and we remain the only Andean nation with zero coca cultivation. Ecuador's counternarcotics efforts have been lauded by the United States State Department, the Department of Defense and the Bush administration. 
 As part of these efforts, we recently started Plan Ecuador, which includes taking over duties performed out of Manta. We have also stationed one-third of our national army along our northern border with Colombia to compensate for a lack of Colombian state presence in the area, as documented in a United States Government Accountability Office report released this month.

HEADLINE: Old Europe and New Brooklyn In the Cafes of Williamsburg

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
The French stake out the terrace of Fabian's Cafe, the Brits convene at the Spike Hill Bar & Grill to watch Manchester United soccer matches, and the Swedish parents meet at one another's apartments for a coffee-and-buns break called ''fika.''
 There is a distinctly West European flavor to the social calendar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, these days, as affluent buyers from France, Germany, Italy and Britain are transforming a neighborhood better known for attracting hipsters, Midwesterners and Polish immigrants.
 Other neighborhoods that have been reshaped by the condo boom of recent years have also seen influxes of foreign buyers investing their yen, pounds and euros in real estate. But the trend has been most visible in Williamsburg, where the newcomers are establishing deeper roots and are not simply looking for weekend pieds-a-terre or investment properties. 
 Many are buying larger apartments with big kitchens to make room for growing families. Some are opening restaurants, foreign-language after-school programs and other small businesses. 
 Many of the immigrants say they have chosen Williamsburg partly because it is cheaper than Manhattan, but also because it is reminiscent of the cities they left behind. They say they like its cafes, its more muted displays of wealth (well, more muted than Manhattan's) and an artistic vibe that reminds some of the Marais neighborhood in Paris, or Brighton, England. The sense of community has softened their pain of being far from friends and relatives. 
 ''Most of my friends actually are French,'' said Scheyla Carriglio, a transplant from Barcelona who bought her Williamsburg apartment two years ago and is a part owner of Mamalu, a coffee shop with an indoor playground on North 12th Street. ''I hardly have any friends who are not European.''
 The influx of Europeans is the latest twist for a neighborhood that has become a symbol of New York's gentrification. Until about a decade ago, Williamsburg was a gritty industrial patch of aging or vacant factories, warehouses and residents who tended to be intrepid artists, working-class immigrants or Hasidic Jews. 
 The weak economy and strengthening dollar seem to have slowed but not stopped the Europeanization of the neighborhood, brokers say. Jonathan Miller, chief executive of the real estate appraisal firm Miller Samuel Inc., said Europeans still make up a higher percentage of condo buyers than they did five years ago. Brokers also say that Europeans who are finding that their euros and pounds are worth less than a year ago or even a few months ago are looking even more closely at Brooklyn, where prices are lower.
 That's especially true in Williamsburg: Over the last five years, its ratio of new condos to existing housing is one of the highest among New York City neighborhoods. And Europeans say there are still bargains to be had.
 ''Now is definitely a buyer's market,'' said Wendy Gouirand, who relocated to Williamsburg from Paris three years ago and hopes to buy now that the market has slowed. She plans to finance part of her purchase with savings she has in euros.
 The international buyers are in the United States on a combination of work visas, green card applications and citizenship acquired through their parents. Many say they want to remain permanently, although the long wait for permanent residency and the economy make such ambitions uncertain. While they all spend a lot of time mulling over this issue, many seem committed to staying for years.
 As the new immigrants have settled into the neighborhood, local businesses have tried to cater to their preferences. Luis Illades, an owner at the organic market Urban Rustic, facing McCarren Park, is selling more freshly baked baguettes than packaged breads to appeal to the growing number of French residents. Fredrick Larsson, owner of a Swedish furniture store, Scandinavian Grace, is greeting customers in different languages and learning to handle their questions.
 ''They don't just want a pretty product,'' Mr. Larsson said about European buyers, who make up half his clientele. ''They are more serious shoppers.''
 Some Europeans are starting their own small businesses. Christian Pala, a musician from Avignon, France, bought out Phoebe's Cafe on Graham Avenue in June and has been expanding its hours and its music schedule. At Mamalu, Ms. Carriglio found that most of the children were bilingual or trilingual, so she plans to add art classes in Italian and French early next year. 
 Chirag Patel, a British citizen who works for a financial services firm, and his wife, Cecilia Trollby, a Swede who is in marketing with a British engineering company, relocated to Williamsburg in March 2007 from Brighton. 
 They describe the change as a succession of fortuitous real estate moves. They profited from selling their house in Brighton during a stronger housing market. Then this fall, when the pound was valued at two to one against the dollar, they bought a two-bedroom loft here, where they live with their 3-year-old son, Viggo. Their building at 100 North Third Street has a familiar international feel: 10 of the 21 buyers are from France, Japan, Germany and the Netherlands, according to the building's real estate agent and broker, Tom Le of the Corcoran Group.
 The transition, they say, has been surprisingly smooth. They have been charmed by how Viggo's preschool recognizes their international backgrounds. When Viggo visited his grandparents in Sweden, he sent back photos of his mother's native country to his classmates. In turn, the classmates found Sweden on a map and learned how to say ''grandma'' in Swedish, and a classmate taught Viggo how to say ''cat'' in French. 
 When Mr. Patel longs for HobNobs biscuits or Branston Pickle relish, he heads to Marlow & Sons, a Williamsburg restaurant. When he wants to watch soccer matches, he hangs out at Spike Hill. Four sets of his British friends are moving to Williamsburg, and he is pleased that the friends he has made in the neighborhood talk less about work when they're off the job than do most New Yorkers. 
 ''There isn't that same kind of talk about money and jobs,'' he said. ''People leave work at work. It's more like friends back home.''
 Ms. Trollby has found a network of Swedish friends through her mothers' group. Each week, she meets with four or five other Swedish parents and their children so they can catch up and their children can practice Swedish. She heard that another Swedish group has been formed for mothers with younger children. Having so many expatriates around has helped her settle in quickly.
 ''You become closer because you celebrate holidays together,'' she said. ''They become like a family, really.''
 Williamsburg's restaurants and markets have become so international that some Europeans find that they miss few things. In Paris, Ms. Gouirand, 36, a marketing executive who has been training at night to become a chef, said she used to live two doors down from a sweet shop known for the best croissants in Paris. She has not felt homesick in three years because she has found all of the ''cheese, pates and cornichons'' she craves in Williamsburg, which she describes as ''the American version of Le Marais.'' 
 And she is never at a loss to find French friends: Her neighbor is from Grenoble; she meets friends at Fabian's, which is known for French pastries; she catches jazz concerts at Zebulon, a French-owned club; and she dines at the French-owned restaurant Fada.
 ''You can't step outside without hearing French around you,'' Ms. Gouirand said.
 Now she plans to take advantage of the weakening real estate market and buyan apartment. She is less interested in buying new construction and more eager to find space with sunlight and a kitchen where she can cook. Manhattan's tall skyscrapers with locked windows are not attractive to her. 
 ''I wouldn't want to be in a building where you can't open the window,'' she said.
 Some Europeans are moving to Williamsburg less for the community and more for the relative bargains. Nearly 2,000 new condos were built there in the past five years, according to the real estate brokerage Halstead Property, more than established neighborhoods like Harlem and the Upper East Side. Foreigners bought a third of all the units built in the last two years.
 Nicola Ventricini, a public relations executive who grew up near Milan, is one of those bargain hunters. While he found an authentic Italian cafe in Williamsburg, he is shopping for an apartment there because he thinks it's the nicest area with units under his price limit of $550,000.
 ''I did not move there because there are Europeans,'' he said. ''I like the neighborhood because it is quiet.''
 Some newcomers lament that their children don't know about their parents' homes. The couple from Brighton, Ms. Trollby and Mr. Patel, say Viggo doesn't seem to miss their old town, with its long, pebbly beach, where he had cousins close by. He is happy throwing stones in the East River, watching Williamsburg's acrobatic skateboarders and drawing pictures of the trucks that rumble by on the way to nearby construction sites.
 ''He doesn't ever remember living next to his grandparents or anything,'' Ms. Trollby said. ''He doesn't know anything else.''

HEADLINE: Nebraska Limits Safe-Haven Law to Infants

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM

DATELINE: DECATUR, Neb. 

 BODY:
The Legislature on Friday revised an unusual law permitting parents to hand children up to age 18 over to state custody without prosecution, instead limiting its reach to infants up to 30 days old. 
 The original law, enacted earlier this year, was intended to protect newborns from being abandoned or killed by panicked young mothers. But since Sept. 1, to the shock of officials and the public in Nebraska, 35 older children, many from 10 to 17 years in age, have been dropped off at hospitals. Most were left by desperate parents who said the children were uncontrollable and violent and needed more counseling or psychiatric services than they could find or pay for. 
 The specter of parents' giving up their children prompted national soul-searching about the limits of parental responsibility. It has also highlighted what child welfare experts say is a widespread shortage of public and private aid, especially mental health services, for overstressed families and teenagers -- a shortage that is likely to worsen in the current economic crisis as state governments cut budgets. 
 The Legislature on Thursday established a commission to propose new measures to help people like Lavennia Coover, a 36-year-old divorced mother of three and kindergarten teacher who was at the end of her rope, financially and emotionally, when she made the wrenching decision to hand over her son. ''I still cry every night,'' Ms. Coover said Friday in an interview at her home in Decatur, a speck of a farm town on the Missouri River, about 60 miles north of Omaha. ''What parent wouldn't feel guilty doing this?''
 Ms. Coover's husband left her alone with three children, including an older bipolar daughter and a 12-year-old boy who is doing well. But her 11-year-old son, Skylar, is bipolar, abusive and violent, she said, and after three years of spotty, expensive and ineffective psychiatric care she could see no other way to get him the intensive help he needs. In September, when he refused to get out of bed and go to school, she physically dragged him out for a few days, then gave up trying. 
 On Sept. 24, after he had become more aggressive and begun throwing food and trashing the house, she told the boy that they were going for a drive to Omaha. Instead she drove to the Alegent Health-Immanuel Medical Center and left Skylar there, invoking the safe-haven law. 
 Skylar suspected what was up. On Labor Day weekend, after a particularly bad spell, he had spent three days -- the maximum her insurance would cover -- in that hospital's psychiatric unit, and as she turned in its direction that day, he said: ''You're taking me back there, aren't you? You lied to me.'' 
 ''I promise I'll behave,'' he wailed. ''I promise I'll go to school.'' 
 ''I said, 'Skylar, you need help that I just can't give you,' '' Ms. Coover recalled. She wept in the emergency room.
 On Sept. 26 child welfare officials in Douglas County, which includes Omaha, filed a petition accusing Ms. Coover of neglect. She is working to have that changed to a ''no fault'' transfer of custody. Being officially declared neglectful could jeopardize her teaching credential and future parental rights. 
 The abrupt handovers in Nebraska are striking examples of an ongoing, more orderly phenomenon that exposes the shortage of psychiatric help for children. A 2003 report by the General Accounting Office, compiling responses from only 19 states and 30 counties, found that 12,700 children in one year had been placed in child welfare or juvenile justice systems simply so they could receive mental health care. 
 As the drop-offs continued through the fall in Nebraska, including five cases in which children were driven in from other states, Gov. Dave Heineman called an emergency session of the Legislature this week to revise the law. 
 Earlier this year, Nebraska was the last of the 50 states to adopt a safe-haven law. But instead of specifying that it applied only to infants up to a certain age, as in other states, Nebraska's version used the word ''child,'' opening the door to handovers of children up to age 18. 
 Many legislators and advocates for children said the desperate actions by caretakers had exposed serious gaps in services, especially for families with troubled older children. The findings of the new commission are sure to be scrutinized by other states where the same unmet needs are rumbling. 
 As in most states, Nebraska offers a patchwork of hot lines, private agencies like Boys Town and public programs that offer counseling and respite shelters to distressed families and runaway children. Some Nebraska officials have said that ample services exist, including free counseling for the poor, but that parents are not fully using them. Many legislators and advocates disagree. 
 Ms. Coover said that her son had received psychiatric care off and on, with limited coverage by her insurance plan, but that he often refused to take prescribed medications. When he refused to go to school, she could not afford a sitter and did not know where to turn. 
 She has spoken out, she said, because newspaper descriptions made her family easily identifiable in their town of 640 and because she resented the way state officials described parents like her as irresponsibly ''abandoning'' their children. 
 Far from abandoning Skylar, she said, she gave her phone number to the hospital and state agencies, has visited him weekly -- he is still in the same hospital but will soon move into a therapeutic foster home with specially trained parents and services -- and hopes he can return home at some point. 
 It was easy for officials to talk of available counseling and mental health services, Ms. Coover said. But in a rural area like hers, such aid is rare, and when she did find it, the offices were distant. 
 ''Good luck finding a counselor -- they're all filled up,'' she said. ''You call a psychiatrist and have to wait three months for an appointment.'' Once during a snowstorm, she said, after she drove 25 miles to pick up the boys at school, then 45 miles to a psychiatric appointment, she arrived 15 minutes late. ''They said we'd have to make a new appointment for six weeks later,'' she said. 
 The short-lived law has yielded many poignant scenes. The same night that Ms. Coover took Skylar in, a father went into another hospital in Omaha and dropped off nine children, saying that since his wife died last year, he could not cope with raising them. Those children, like some others handed to the state, have moved in with relatives, but most are in foster care or group homes. 
 Courtney Anderson, a social worker at Immanuel Hospital, said that some of the children taken to the emergency room cried and begged their parent or guardian not to leave them. Some did not realize what was happening. ''Some knew, but were just numb,'' Ms. Anderson said. 
 Nine of the 35 drop-offs occurred at Immanuel Hospital, but at least as many more families arrived intending to leave a child but were talked out of it by social workers who offered respite care, parenting classes and referrals to other aid that, Ms. Anderson said, the parents had not known about. 
 Even with children suffering more severe psychiatric problems, Ms. Anderson said, state child welfare and other agencies ''came together quickly'' to offer help. 
 ''Everyone wants the families to stay together,'' she said. ''And we are looking forward to the solutions that the new commission proposes.''

HEADLINE: Prices in Canada Decline, Raising Fears of Deflation

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA 

 BODY:
Prices in Canada fell by 1 percent on an unadjusted basis from September to October, the largest such decline in 49 years, Statistics Canada reported on Friday. 
 But the report provoked a mixed response from economists about the prospects for deflation in Canada. 
 Accounting for seasonal variances, the Canadian government agency said, the inflation rate was 2.6 percent in October, compared with 3.4 percent a month earlier. The core inflation rate, a measure that excludes several items with volatile prices, was 1.7 percent.
 Among the most significant reductions was a 9 percent decline in the cost of buying or leasing a car. It followed a 9.3 percent fall in September.
 Unlike in the United States, in Canada, consumer credit for large purchases remains generally available, and auto and light truck sales rose by 1.5 percent last month.
 Michael McCracken, the chairman and chief executive of Informetrica, an economic analysis company based in Ottawa, dismissed fears that Canada was heading toward sustained price reductions.
 ''This is not deflation; this is not something that's going to continue for a long time,'' he said. ''It's good news in that the people at the central bank can now spend more time worrying about the real economy and the state of financial institutions, rather than the incipient inflation they seem to see around every corner.''
 But Karen Cordes, an economist with Scotia Capital, a unit of the Bank of Nova Scotia, was not as positive. She titled a note released on Friday, ''Canadian Deflation Fears Mount.''
 In it, she said that the unadjusted figures in the Statistics Canada report showed that ''almost every component fell, illustrating widespread discounting.''
 One factor that may offset the potential for deflation is a recent drop in the value of the Canadian dollar. After starting the year near to parity with its American counterpart, the loonie, as the Canadian currency is popularly known, fell below 80 United States cents this week.
 A lower Canadian dollar, in theory, should increase the cost of imported goods.
 That already appears to be the case for food. Most of Canada's off-season fresh food comes from the United States, and the food component of Canada's inflation rate rose 6.1 percent last month.

HEADLINE: At Wal-Mart, Successor Is Chosen for Its Chief

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
After nearly a decade as chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores, H. Lee Scott Jr. said he would retire at the end of January, walking away at a triumphant time for the nation's largest retailer.
 Wal-Mart's international chief, Michael T. Duke, 58, will be the next chief executive and president, underscoring the importance the company is placing on its international stores and overseas growth. 
 A company spokesman said Mr. Scott, 59, told directors the time was right to leave Wal-Mart, one of the few retailers thriving in a weak economy. The spokesman, David Tovar, said the change was part of a long-term succession plan. 
 In a letter distributed to Wal-Mart employees on Friday, Rob Walton, the board's chairman, said Mr. Scott told him: ''This is a great job, but you can't do it forever and at that point you have an obligation to find the right time for a transition.''
 Mr. Scott, who joined Wal-Mart in 1979, will remain chairman of the executive committee of the board until January 2011. 
 Retailing analysts and executives were not surprised Mr. Duke was tapped for the job, though the timing of the announcement caught them off guard because there were no rumblings about Mr. Scott leaving. They had suspected, though, that the chief executive job would eventually go to Mr. Duke or to Eduardo Castro-Wright, 53, president and chief executive of Wal-Mart's United States operations. C. Douglas McMillon, president and chief executive of Sam's Club, a division of Wal-Mart, was also a contender, though most analysts said it was a two-candidate race. 
 Mr. Duke is a predictable choice. He is one of a handful of Wal-Mart executives who worked with Sam Walton, the company's revered founder. As vice chairman of Wal-Mart's international division since 2005, he has expertise in an area that Wal-Mart sees as critical to growth, as the United States is nearly saturated with Wal-Mart stores. Additionally, Mr. Duke's experience working for Federated Department Stores and May Department Stores for more than two decades will probably prove useful as the company tries to fix its struggling apparel business. 
 Wal-Mart said it would name Mr. Duke's successor by January, indicating that Mr. Scott was likely to leave the decision to Mr. Duke and Mr. Castro-Wright. Mr. Castro-Wright, who joined Wal-Mart in 2001, was named vice chairman, and in addition to his current responsibilities, he will also oversee global procurement.
 ''This management change occurs at a time of strength and momentum for Wal-Mart,'' Rob Walton said. ''We are confident that the strategy we have in place is the right one for future success, and Mike has been actively involved in developing and executing this strategy.''
 Last week, Wal-Mart reported a 10 percent increase in profit for the three months ending in October. Profit rose to $3.14 billion, or 80 cents a share, compared with $2.86 billion, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Most retail analysts expect Wal-Mart to do well this Christmas as consumers look for ways to economize. 
 Not long ago, Wal-Mart faced some of its darkest days, including the filing of one of the biggest class-action gender discrimination lawsuits in the country. Three years ago, the stock was sinking, prompting investors to call for change at the highest ranks. 
 Mr. Scott decided to take the company's critics head-on, setting up a war room of public relations professionals.
 ''Previously, they didn't respond to their critics,'' said Bill Dreher, a senior retailing analyst with Deutsche Bank Securities. ''He's really resolved that.'' 
 Eventually, Mr. Scott met with some of those critics, particularly environmental groups, and began making changes. A hallmark of his tenure will no doubt be the sustainability projects he has led, including programs to reduce Wal-Mart's use of energy and water.
 ''He started it,'' said Walter Loeb, president of Loeb Associates, a retail consulting firm, ''and it will be a legacy for him.''
 Mr. Scott, through Mr. Tovar, declined to comment about the particular reasons for his departure or any plans he might have. 
 Kirk Palmer, chief executive of Kirk Palmer & Associates, an executive search company, said it was common for chief executives to stay in their jobs at least five years and depart somewhere near the decade mark. Mr. Loeb said Mr. Scott would have a new grandchild soon and might want to spend more time with his family.
 Some industry professionals, however, suggested the coming change of administrations in Washington might have prompted Wal-Mart's moves. The company has fought unionization, and the new administration and Congress are expected to take steps to make union drives easier.
 ''It's more than just a coincidence that we're seeing a leadership change at Wal-Mart at the same time that we're seeing a leadership transition in the White House and on Capitol Hill,'' Mr. Dreher said. ''Wal-Mart has been a very Republican type of company.'' 
 David Nassar, the executive director of Wal-Mart Watch, a union-financed group critical of the retailer, said Wal-Mart would want to put forth a new face that, unlike Mr. Scott, is not so closely associated with efforts to discourage unionization and to curtail worker benefits. 
 ''I think there's no way you can divorce this move from the broader political context,'' Mr. Nassar said. 
 Investors sent Wal-Mart's stock up by more than 4 percent, to close at $52.92 a share. 
 In separate retailing news, the Target Corporation said it would not reorganize the company and create a real estate investment trust, an idea proposed publicly last month by William Ackman, an activist investor and hedge-fund manager who owns nearly 10 percent of Target's stock. 
 Target's board and outside advisers, including Goldman Sachs, said that there was not enough value, ''if any,'' to be generated by overhauling the company and that the risks of doing so were ''significant.''

HEADLINE: Time For Him To Go

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Thanksgiving is next week, and President Bush could make it a really special holiday by resigning.
 Seriously. We have an economy that's crashing and a vacuum at the top. Bush -- who is currently on a trip to Peru to meet with Asian leaders who no longer care what he thinks -- hasn't got the clout, or possibly even the energy, to do anything useful. His most recent contribution to resolving the fiscal crisis was lecturing representatives of the world's most important economies on the glories of free-market capitalism. 
 Putting Barack Obama in charge immediately isn't impossible. Dick Cheney, obviously, would have to quit as well as Bush. In fact, just to be on the safe side, the vice president ought to turn in his resignation first. (We're desperate, but not crazy.) Then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would become president until Jan. 20. Obviously, she'd defer to her party's incoming chief executive, and Barack Obama could begin governing. 
 As a bonus, the Pelosi presidency would put a woman in the White House this year after all. On the downside, a few right-wing talk-show hosts might succumb to apoplexy. That would, of course, be terrible, but I'm afraid we might have to take the risk in the name of a greater good.
 Can I see a show of hands? How many people want George W. out and Barack in? 
 A great many Americans have been counting the days all year on their 2008 George W. Bush Out of Office Countdown calendars. I know a lot of this has been going on because so many people congratulated me when the Feb. 1 Bush quote turned out to be from one of my old columns. (''I think we need not only to eliminate the tollbooth from the middle class, I think we should knock down the tollbooth.'') 
 This was not nearly as good as Feb. 5 (''We ought to make the pie higher'') or Feb. 21 (''I understand small business growth. I was one.'') But we do what we can.
 In the past, presidents have not taken well to suggestions that they hand over the reins before the last possible minute. Senator J. William Fulbright suggested a plan along those lines when Harry Truman was coming to the end of a term in a state of deep unpopularity, and Truman called him ''Halfbright'' for the rest of his life. Bush might not love the idea of quitting before he has a chance to light the Christmas tree or commute the execution of one last presidential turkey. After all, he still has a couple more trips planned. And last-minute regulations to issue. (So many national parks to despoil, so many endangered species to exterminate ... .) And then there's all the packing. 
 On the other hand, he might want to consider his legacy, such as it is.
 In happier days, Bush may have nurtured hopes of making it into the list of America's mediocre presidents, but somewhere between Iraq and Katrina, that goal became a mountain too high. However, he might still have a chance to avoid the absolute bottom of the barrel, a spot currently occupied by James Buchanan, at least in my opinion. Buchanan nailed down The Worst President title in the days between Abraham Lincoln's election and inauguration, when the Southern states began seceding and Buchanan, after a little flailing about, did absolutely nothing. ''Doing nothing is almost the worst thing a president can do,'' said the historian Michael Beschloss.
 If Bush gives up doing nothing by giving up his job, it's possible that someday history might elevate him to the ranks of the below average. Better than Franklin Pierce! Smarter than Warren Harding! And healthier than William Henry Harrison! 
 The person who would like this plan least probably would be Barack Obama. Who would want to be saddled with the auto industry's problems ahead of schedule? The heads of America's great carmaking corporations are so dim that they couldn't even survive hearings run by members of Congress who actually wanted to help them. Really, when somebody asks you exactly how much money you need, the answer should not be something along the line of ''a whole bunch.''
 An instantaneous takeover would also ruin the Obama team's plan to have the tidiest, best-organized presidential transition in history. Cutting it short and leaping into governing would turn their measured march toward power into a mad scramble. A lot of their Cabinet picks are still working on those 62-page questionnaires. 
 But while there's been no drama with Obama, we've been living a Technicolor version of ''The Perils of Pauline.'' Detroit is tied to the railroad tracks and the train is coming! California's state government is falling into the sea! The way we're going now, by the time the inauguration rolls around, unemployment will be at 10 percent and the Dow will be at 10.
 Time for a change.

HEADLINE: Qaddafi Son Says Libya Wants to Invest in U.S.

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Libya would like to open a new chapter in relations with the United States by tapping into a major government fund to invest in American corporations and by sending thousands of students to study in the United States, a son of Libya's leader said Friday. 
 In an interview, Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, a son of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the leader of Libya, also outlined plans for Libya to move from the one-man rule of his father to a constitutional democracy as part of the country's modernization process.
 The younger Qaddafi said he expected that a constitution providing for democratic elections would be adopted by next September -- the 40th anniversary of the revolution that brought his father to power. 
 He said he expected Libya to modify its central government to a model similar to the United States federal government, with strong regional and local governments.
 Seif Qaddafi, who was a central figure in normalizing Libya's relations with the United States, is on a private visit to the United States. But his trip included meetings with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, other administration officials and many members of Congress.
 It also coincided with the confirmation on Friday of Gene Cretz as the first American ambassador to Libya in 36 years. The confirmation capped a halting, five-year reconciliation between the countries that began in 2003, when the Libyan leader renounced terrorism and unconventional weapons. 
 The younger Qaddafi said that Libya's sovereign wealth fund, a government-owned investment fund with almost $100 billion, would like to invest in American companies, despite the current financial crisis. 
 Libya's other major focus is promoting education links with the United States. Seif Qaddafi said he expected Libya to sign a cultural and educational agreement with the American government next month.
 In addition to sending ''thousands of our students to study here,'' he said, Libya has begun conversations with American colleges and universities about operating there.

 Employers are shifting more health care costs onto their employees, with average annual deductibles for an individual now over $1,000 for the first time this year, The Los Angeles Times reports. According to Mercer, a benefits consulting firm, rising deductibles are being used to offset increases in premiums and rising costs. 
 Cancer Rates Higher Among Patients With H.I.V.
 Patients with H.I.V. are living longer, but they're at a much higher risk of developing cancers of the lung, liver, head and neck, notes the Baltimore Sun, and researchers are struggling to understand why. New research from Johns Hopkins University shows patients with H.I.V. are twice as likely as those without to get cancers that had not been thought linked to the illness.
 Teen Survives Three Months Without a Heart
 A South Carolina teenager who was kept alive by an artificial heart machine for 118 days -- living without a heart after a first heart transplant failed -- left Holtz Children's Hospital in Miami on Wednesday after receiving a new heart and kidney, The Miami Herald reports. The girl was on the artificial heart machine from July 4, when a first heart transplant failed, until Oct 29.

HEADLINE: The Candidate of Change Chooses Experience

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama won the Democratic nomination with the enthusiastic support of the left wing of his party, fueled by his vehement opposition to the decision to invade Iraq and by one of the most liberal voting records in the Senate.
 Now, his reported selections for two of the major positions in his cabinet -- Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state and Timothy F. Geithner as secretary of the Treasury -- suggest that Mr. Obama is planning to govern from the center-right of his party, surrounding himself with pragmatists rather than ideologues. 
 The choices are as revealing of the new president as they are of his appointees -- and suggest that, from its first days, an Obama White House will brim with big personalities and far more spirited debate than occurred among the largely like-minded advisers who populated President Bush's first term. 
 But the names racing through the ether in Washington about the choices to follow also suggest that Mr. Obama continues to place a premium on deep experience. He is widely reported to be considering asking Mr. Bush's defense secretary, Robert M. Gates, to stay on for a year; and he is thinking about Gen. James L. Jones, the former NATO commander and Marine Corps commandant, for national security adviser, and placing Lawrence H. Summers, the former Treasury secretary whom Mr. Obama considered putting back in his old post, inside the White House as a senior economic adviser. 
 ''This is the violin model: Hold power with the left hand, and play the music with your right,'' David J. Rothkopf, a former Clinton official who wrote a history of the National Security Council, said on Friday, as news of Mrs. Clinton's and Mr. Geithner's appointments leaked. ''It's teaching us something about Obama: while he wants to bring new ideas to the game, he is working from the center space of American foreign policy.''
 The reason, several of Mr. Obama's transition team members say, is that they believe that the new administration will have no time for a learning curve. With the country facing a deep recession or worse, global market turmoil, chaos in Pakistan and a worsening war in Afghanistan, ''there's going to be no time for experimentation,'' a member of the Obama foreign policy team said.
 That explains Mr. Obama's first selection: Rahm Emanuel, another centrist Democrat and former member of the Clinton White House, as his chief of staff.
 In some ways, the choices made so far are reminiscent of the way the last senator to be elected president, John F. Kennedy, chose a cabinet. As president-elect, Kennedy soon picked three top officials significantly more conservative than he was: Dean Rusk as secretary of state, Robert S. McNamara as secretary of defense and C. Douglas Dillon, a Republican, as secretary of the Treasury. They helped him navigate the Cuban missile crisis, but also got him bogged down in Vietnam. 
 Of all the choices Mr. Obama has made so far, it is the selection of Mrs. Clinton that appears the biggest gamble, in part because she has never had to engage in the give-and-take of high-stakes diplomacy, and in part because no one really knows how she will mesh with the Obama White House. 
 In her discussion with the president-elect, several members of his transition team said, Mrs. Clinton expressed no doubt that she could be a loyal member of the Obama team -- though she was reportedly deeply conflicted about giving up her Senate seat and the independent power base it afforded her. 
 During the battle for the Democratic presidential nomination, Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton went out of their way to point out their foreign policy differences, with Mrs. Clinton portraying herself as a hawkish Democrat and defending her decision to vote in favor of the 2002 resolution that Mr. Bush later considered an authorization to use military force against Saddam Hussein. (Later, she said she fully expected Mr. Bush to use diplomacy first -- and was shocked that he did not.) 
 Now the question is less one of ideological differences than whether a Clinton State Department could become something like Colin L. Powell's: an alternative, though weak, power center that made little secret of its differences with the White House.
 ''Anyone who tells you they really know how this is going to work out,'' one senior transition official said Thursday, ''is telling less than the truth.''
 If Mrs. Clinton is taken from the ''Team of Rivals'' model, Mr. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is from the Team of Neutrals. 
 ''He's no liberal,'' said a former colleague at the Treasury Department, where he managed the American response to the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s.
 At the time Mr. Geithner developed a reputation as the ultimate pragmatist, putting together a package of more than $100 billion in aid to halt the financial contagion. That turned out to be a training session for his role, a decade later, in the bailouts of Bear Stearns, A.I.G. and the injection of nearly $350 billion in Congressionally authorized money, whose exact use has become something of a political football.
 Mr. Geithner grew up in Asia -- in Tokyo, New Delhi and Bangkok -- and keeps his ego well in check. He asks a lot of questions, but does not have Mr. Summers's overwhelming -- some say overbearing -- personality. 
 ''He clicked with Obama,'' one outside adviser said. ''If you think about it, their sort of cool, distant styles are alike.''

HEADLINE: Allies and Prospects in Latin America Frustrate Russia's Efforts to Build Ties

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO, MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ and ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO; Simon Romero reported from Caracas, Venezuela; Michael Schwirtz from Moscow; and Alexei Barrionuevo from Rio de Janeiro. Blake Schmidt and Marc Lacey contributed reporting from Managua, Nicaragua.. 
Simon Romero reported from Caracas, Venezuela, Michael Schwirtz from Moscow, and Alexei Barrionuevo from Rio de Janeiro. Blake Schmidt and Marc Lacey contributed reporting from Managua, Nicaragua.

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela 

 BODY:
This article was reported by Simon Romero, Michael Schwirtz and Alexei Barrionuevo and written by Mr. Romero.
 When President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia planned his coming trip through Latin America, his country seemed poised to present one of the most visible challenges in years to American influence in the region. With oil prices high, Russia was flush with cash and planning a variety of measures, including helping Venezuela build a nuclear reactor and strengthening military ties with Cuba, a former cold war ally of the Soviets. 
 But when Mr. Medvedev reaches the region next week, he will find it in flux in reaction to recent events -- and in some cases less receptive to his overtures. Plunging oil prices and the global financial crisis, which have hammered Russia particularly hard, have raised questions about Russia's reliability as an economic partner, while Barack Obama's victory in the presidential race has raised hopes throughout Latin America of a new era of improved relations with the United States. 
 In this rapidly changing landscape, most Latin American countries are recalibrating their political interests, frustrating Russia's efforts to deepen regional ties, like the ones China established in the past decade. 
 ''Russia's elites, including President Medvedev, look on China's rising diplomatic and economic successes in Latin America and in Africa with envy,'' said Stephen Kotkin, the director of Russia studies at Princeton University. ''They also perceive an opportunity, much exaggerated, to send the U.S. a message in its supposed backyard.'' 
 But Mr. Medvedev faces a hard sell in the region. In Cuba there are lingering suspicions over Russian intentions, as the Cuban economy collapsed when the Soviets withdrew in the 1990s, as well as a reluctance to alienate an incoming Obama administration that might push to end the trade embargo.
 Brazil, Latin America's largest country, which also places a high priority on relations with an Obama administration, wants to engage Russia not as a source of weapons or military assistance, but as an equal partner. 
 ''We are not interested in buying defense products off the shelf,'' said Roberto Mangabeira Unger, Brazil's minister of strategic affairs and the architect of a new military strategy set to be officially unveiled in December.
 ''Unlike other South American countries we don't go around buying things, and we are not interested in some kind of balance-of-power politics to contain the United States,'' said Mr. Mangabeira Unger, a former Harvard law professor who taught Mr. Obama when he was at Harvard Law School. ''We have friendly relations with the United States, and with the incoming administration intend to make them even more friendly.'' 
 By contrast in Venezuela, itself battered by falling oil prices, Mr. Medvedev can expect a warm welcome. President Hugo Chavez has long sought closer ties, traveling to Russia seven times and forging deals to buy more than $4 billion in arms. Until recently, however, Russia showed little interest in expanding ties with Venezuela beyond weapons sales and a handful of energy deals. 
 But Russia's position evolved in recent months, and it is now seeking a beachhead with a raft of oil, as well as mining, banking and military contracts. Yet in choosing to invest in Venezuela, energy executives and foreign diplomats say, Moscow is becoming involved in one of the most problematic countries in the region. Countries like China and Iran have faced a morass of corruption and institutional disarray while seeking to expand their presence here. 
 The Russian foray into Latin America has been viewed in many quarters as payback for what the Kremlin sees as an aggressive infringement by the United States on its sphere of influence. Moscow has been angered by American plans to deploy a missile defense system in Eastern Europe as well as by Washington's support for Kosovo's independence and for Georgia in the August war, which the Kremlin claimed that the White House helped provoke.
 In Colombia, where there is fear over Russian-made weapons in neighboring Venezuela finding their way across the border to leftist guerrillas, Russia's moves are partly seen as tit-for-tat for the growing NATO presence in former Soviet bloc countries. ''In a sense, Venezuela is becoming Russia's Ukraine,'' said Roman Ortiz, a security analyst in Bogota, the Colombian capital. 
 Two Russian strategic bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons made a visit to Venezuela in September, a few weeks before Russia announced a $1 billion loan to the country for weapons purchases. And a contingent of the Russian Navy's North Sea Fleet is now en route to the Caribbean to take part in training exercises with the Venezuelan Navy, maneuvers scheduled to coincide with Mr. Medvedev's visit here. 
 ''If the country has stood on its feet and is beginning to extend its economic and political roles, then it cannot remain locally focused,'' said Andrei Klimov, the deputy head of the International Affairs Committee in Russia's Parliament. He emphasized that Russia's policies in Latin America were not ''directed against a specific country.''
 ''It is simply that Russia has developed defined interests, and we want to realize those interests, particularly in business -- in oil, gas, in new technologies, in weapons sales,'' Mr. Klimov said. 
 Russia has also been seeking to rekindle cold war-era ties in countries that are now allies of Venezuela, like Nicaragua, the recipient of Soviet military aid in the 1980s. With the left-wing Sandinistas back in power in Nicaragua, Russian officials have traveled recently to Managua, the capital, to discuss grandiose projects like a new canal to rival the Panama Canal. 
 But for now, Russia's foray into Nicaragua remains limited to the training of about a dozen Nicaraguan military personnel, a shadow of the once prominent role played by the Soviet Union during the first government of President Daniel Ortega, when Soviet military specialists helped build Pachito Air Base, now badly in need of repairs. 
 Russia has carved out a presence in other small countries with limited economic clout in the region, like Bolivia, where Russia is offering military and antidrug assistance. In Guyana, Russia has warm ties with President Bharrat Jagdeo, who studied economics in Moscow when Guyana was ruled by socialists with close ties to the Soviet Union. 
 But elsewhere in the area, the Kremlin is having a harder time. In Cuba, where the Soviet Union once focused the bulk of its military presence in the region, concern persists over the collapse of the Soviet Union. The abrupt withdrawal of billions of dollars of aid devastated Cuba's economy, which has yet to completely recover despite receiving large subsidies from Venezuela. 
 Under President Raul Castro, the Cuban government may be looking to capitalize on the change in leadership in Washington by seeking to loosen America's costly embargo, said Brian Latell, a former C.I.A. analyst and the author of ''After Fidel.''
 ''Raul and the Cuban leadership are much more pragmatic than Fidel and are less inclined to poke Washington in the eye,'' he said. ''Why antagonize American interest groups now by cavorting'' with the Kremlin? 
 Cuba backed Russia's military incursion into Georgia, but it has been unwilling to recognize the two separatist enclaves, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, whose independence Russia recognized after the August war. That action was strongly condemned by the international community, with Nicaragua the only other country to offer official recognition.
 Meanwhile, skepticism persists even in Venezuela over Russia's ability to expand ties that mainly involve weapons sales into a relationship that involves greater amounts of investment and diplomatic coordination. 
 In diplomatic circles in Caracas, a joke is making the rounds comparing the Latin American strategy of China, which views market-oriented economies like Brazil, Chile and Mexico as gateways to the region, with that of Russia, which is largely focusing on Bolivia, Nicaragua and Venezuela. In Brazil, Russia's trade of $5.2 billion in 2007 was dwarfed by China's $23.4 billion.
 ''The Russians have picked the most erratic and unreliable partners in the region,'' said a Bush administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, following normal diplomatic protocol. 
 And even in areas where Russia and Venezuela are starting to cooperate, like offshore natural gas exploration, the new alliance belies the resilience of ties to the United States, which remains by far Venezuela's largest trading partner. 
 When state television in Venezuela trumpeted the start of exploration this month by the country's state oil company and a consortium of Russian businesses amid cries of ''Comrades!'' all around, little attention was directed to the drilling platform they were standing on. It had been leased from Scorpion Offshore, which monitors its rigs around the world from its home office in Houston.

HEADLINE: It's a Triumph for Clinton, Many Women Agree

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR; Reporting was contributed by Michael Barbaro, Lisa Belkin, Winter Miller, Conrad Mulcahy and Scott Shane.

 BODY:
Hillary Rodham Clinton, a first lady turned senator turned almost-president, is now transforming herself again, this time into the nation's top diplomat. But she is also back to a role she cannot seem to shake: a canvas for women's highest hopes and deepest fears about the workplace.
 As she pondered this week whether to trade her hard-won independence and elected office for a job working for a more powerful man, mothers and schoolteachers and law partners mulled in tandem with her. After eight years of building her own constituency, how could Mrs. Clinton surrender it? they asked. Is secretary of state a promotion or an acknowledgment that her political prospects are now limited? And ultimately, how well will her male boss treat her? 
 As news spread on Friday evening that Mrs. Clinton had decided to accept the job, so did a basic consensus: the assignment was probably a triumph for Mrs. Clinton, if a costly one.
 Gloria Steinem said in an interview, ''Secretary of state is far superior to vice president, because it's involved in continuously solving problems and making policy and not being on standby.'' 
 Liz Kuoppala, a City Council member in Eveleth, Minn., said, ''As a senator, you're just 1 of 100, and she's had to play quiet and polite.'' 
 ''I think this will allow her to blossom,'' Ms. Kuoppala added. ''It's good for women everywhere.''
 On pro-Clinton e-mail lists, supporters were already calling their heroine the next George Marshall, a figure who would reshape the world while President-elect Barack Obama becomes entangled in the sinking economy. 
 Their case for Mrs. Clinton's decision as feminist triumph has gone something like this: Ten years ago, she was still a first lady whose hairstyles were the subject of late-night jokes; now she will be the world's top diplomat. She may still be in a more powerful man's shadow, but being married to a president and working for one are worlds apart. And Mrs. Clinton is such an esteemed figure, no one will see her as a mere emissary. 
 ''If she mishandles a negotiation between two disputing nations, she can't blame that on somebody else,'' said Christine C. Quinn, the first female speaker of the New York City Council and a longtime political friend of Ms. Clinton. ''She will be the one on the line, just as she is as a senator.''
 And in terms of sheer impact, the imprint she leaves on the world and on history, the State Department would offer a more global platform than the Senate. ''I always come back to what Hillary wants, which is to do the most important work she can do, the biggest work,'' said Susie Tompkins Buell, a longtime supporter and friend of Mrs. Clinton from San Francisco.
 But there are corresponding worries: that Mrs. Clinton will have to compete with Vice President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. for influence, that Mr. Obama, just months ago her mortal rival, will not trust her fully with assignments.
 Some are sad to see Mrs. Clinton, who recently made a bid to lead health care reform in the Senate but walked away empty-handed, part from her core issue.
 Nancy B. White, a retired school administrator in Bloomington, Ind., who cheered Mrs. Clinton on in primary rallies last spring, wishes Ms. Clinton would have stayed on Capitol Hill. 
 ''I would have told her to hang tough in Congress and work on health care,'' Ms. White said.
 Like many others interviewed, Marie C. Wilson, president of the White House Project, a women's leadership organization, said she would like to have seen Mrs. Clinton as Senate majority leader, a situation she now knows will never happen.
 ''I feel real mixed about this. I think it's better for women to be their own boss,'' Ms. Wilson said, pointing out that more governors than senators had become president in recent times. 
 The fledgling Obama administration is a mostly male club, with figures like Rahm Emanuel, Eric H. Holder Jr. and Timothy F. Geithner filling or expected to fill top positions, and in recent days, some speculated that Mrs. Clinton was selected, at least in some small part, because she was a woman. 
 Throughout Mrs. Clinton's presidential run, women across the country saw in her a mirror of their own career fortunes: when she teared up just before the New Hampshire primary that she was expected to lose, they remembered their own workplace humiliations, and when she lost the Democratic nomination, many saw it as an accumulation of all-too-familiar sexist slights. Now several of those interviewed said her selection as secretary of state -- the third woman to hold the position -- said nothing much about gender at all.
 ''The question of whether one has one's own political power or goes to work for someone else is not only a feminist question,'' Ms. Steinem pointed out.
 Ms. Quinn agreed, ''If she was a guy going to work for a guy, nobody would ask if it was a diminution of her voice.'' 
 ''Our country has been shunned by our allies, been rejected off of the world stage,'' she continued. ''The president, who has a job that you have the deepest respect for, says 'You are our gal, put our country back on the world stage.' Unless you are blind with ambition, how can you walk away from it? It's a calling too great for somebody who has a deep sense of patriotism and duty.''

HEADLINE: Road Ahead Is Long For G.M.

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
Is it really possible that General Motors has not yet begun drawing up contingency plans for a bankruptcy filing -- as the chief executive, Rick Wagoner, told Congress this week?
 Hard to believe, isn't it? Though it still has $16 billion in the bank, G.M. is burning through $2 billion a month. Car sales have slowed to a crawl. Meanwhile, commentators from Jack Welch to Mitt Romney to my colleague Andrew Ross Sorkin are saying that bankruptcy is General Motors' only hope. The mere fact that Mr. Wagoner was on Capitol Hill this week, pleading for billions in federal aid alongside the heads of Chrysler, Ford and the United Automobile Workers, suggests, at a minimum, a certain desperation. If he is telling the truth about the lack of contingency planning, Mr. Wagoner is either being incredibly short-sighted or is playing a dangerous game of brinksmanship. I'm not sure which is worse. 
 This was another one of those weeks that made your head hurt. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who now has zero credibility among investors, announced that the Treasury Department had changed its mind and was not going to use the TARP money to buy toxic assets after all. Though this was hardly a surprise, the market reacted as if the rug had been pulled out from under it. The stock market tanked. The credit markets froze again. After an awful week, Citigroup appeared be at the brink. Rumors were flying about the health of other financial firms.
 Then, late Friday, word leaked out that the New York Federal Reserve president, Timothy Geithner, is expected to be named President-elect Obama's Treasury secretary. Indeed, the president-elect is expected to unveil his entire economic team at a news conference on Monday -- not a moment too soon, given the way the current Treasury Department has thrown in the towel. Investors were so happy that, in the blink of an eye, the market shot up 500 points. 
 All of this tended to overshadow the other news of the week: the trek to Capitol Hill by the auto company chieftains, who sought $25 billion in federal loans -- and instead got their heads handed to them by angry congressmen. Incredibly, the C.E.O.'s came with no convincing plan of action, no promise to do better, no offers of management resignations. Even the most sympathetic Democrats, like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, seemed to turn against them, telling them not to come back unless they devised a plan to show Washington how they would use the money to turn the companies around. And thus the tom-toms of bankruptcy grew louder. What else is left for them to do?
 Before the country decides to head down that path, though, let's consider for a minute what that would mean and what it would entail. In his Times op-ed article this week, Mr. Romney called for ''a managed bankruptcy,'' making it sound as if such a move would allow G.M.-- with more or less a snap of a finger -- to close plants, invest in new products, abolish gold-plated union benefits and make the industry more competitive. 
 But bankruptcy is anything but a snap. It is a long, difficult, drawn-out process with no guarantee that a bankruptcy judge will go along with everything G.M. wants to do. Several bankruptcy lawyers I spoke to all made the same point: if there is any way these goals can be accomplished outside of the bankruptcy process, then that should be tried first. As one lawyer put it to me, ''Bankruptcy sucks as a way to achieve real business resolution.'' As it happens, I think there is another approach that might work. But it won't be particularly easy either.
 The first thing that becomes obvious, when you start digging into the subject of a G.M. bankruptcy, is that the idea of a so-called prepackaged bankruptcy -- a ''prepack,'' as it's called -- is not remotely applicable for any of the Big Three auto companies. In a prepack, all the issues are negotiated ahead of time, allowing the company to get in and out of bankruptcy in a quick, pro-forma fashion.
 ''The idea is that you've lined up all the major stakeholders, and then it is easy to get the debtor-in-possession financing,'' said Edward I. Altman, a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, who also runs a bankruptcy prediction service. (Debtor-in-possession financing is the term for the money that is loaned to the company while it is in bankruptcy.) ''But,'' he added, ''I don't think it is feasible in G.M.'s case.'' 
 G.M. has too many constituents and a set of issues that are too gnarly to be negotiated in advance of bankruptcy. The company simply wouldn't have the leverage to force the big changes it needed. Mr. Altman said that even in the best-case scenario, it would take G.M. at least two years to work through those issues in an ordinary bankruptcy process. Though a prepack bankruptcy is the idea du jour, it makes no sense.
 The second thing that's obvious -- and has been for awhile -- is that if General Motors is to avoid bankruptcy, it can't do business as usual. Its world has changed, and it has to change. Even its most staunch allies in Congress understand that, which is why they are not willing to put up $25 billion in federal loans. G.M. and the others will have to go through some kind of wrenching process that is, if not bankruptcy, at least ''bankruptcy-like.''
 For instance, it is critical for General Motors to be able to break its contracts with both its unions and its dealers. It needs to dramatically reduce its legacy benefits, perhaps even eliminating health care benefits for union retirees. It needs to close plants. It needs to pay its workers what Toyota workers are paid in the United States -- and not a penny more. It needs to reduce the number of brands it sells -- which means closing down thousands of dealerships, which is difficult to do because of state laws that protect car dealers. When General Motors shut down Oldsmobile, it cost the company more than $1 billion to buy out the Oldsmobile dealerships across the country. If it slims down its dealerships from 7,000 to a more appropriate 1,500, it will cost many times that amount.
 Under the current rules of the road, only bankruptcy will allow G.M. to cram down a new contract on the U.A.W., or get out from under its dealership agreements. But it can only do so after proving to the bankruptcy judge that it has tried to negotiate a new contract, which takes a very long time, and creates immense enmity. In addition, there would be so many moving parts in a General Motors bankruptcy, so many creditors who would have a seat at the table, so many stakeholders looking for every tiny advantage, that it would be impossibly complicated. Delphi, a company not nearly G.M.'s size but one with similarly complicated issues, has been in bankruptcy for four years. No one connected to that bankruptcy is willing to predict when the company might emerge.
 So is there another way to get to the same place? I think there is, but it will require the active involvement of both Congress and the new Obama administration. Think back to the Chrysler bailout in the 1980s. In return for legislation that gave the company a $1.5 billion federally guaranteed loan -- the number seems so quaint now, like Dr. Evil demanding a $1 million ransom! -- Chrysler had to obtain serious concessions from its union workers. The union had resisted Chrysler's efforts to negotiate a new deal, but with the federal guarantee at stake, it relented.
 There is no reason the government couldn't do something similar now, though it would dangle a much larger loan agreement in return for much more radical changes. Someone in the Obama administration, with both business savvy and a suitably tough-minded approach, could bring together the parties, including the dealers, the union and the company. He (or she) could force the union and the company to renegotiate their contracts. With his input, Congress could perhaps pass a law that dealt with the state laws governing dealerships. (Or the government could pay off the dealers itself, instead of having G.M. do it.) He could sign off on plant closings. He could force the companies to come up with real plans that would return them to profitability. And in return, the government would make federal loans that would give them the breathing room they need.
 Come to think of it, this would be a perfect first job for Lawrence Summers, who is expected to become an economic adviser to the president-elect. If he can't knock these heads together, nobody can.
 With the government in the room, it would be much harder for the parties to say no than if they were negotiating on their own -- or even in a bankruptcy proceeding. In this time of crisis, the government has a moral authority that no one institution can match. Just ask Jamie Dimon, the JPMorgan Chase chief executive, who took $25 billion from Treasury that his company didn't need, and didn't really want -- because Mr. Paulson told him he had to for the good of the country. Of course, this also means that President-elect Obama and his appointee are willing to impose tough conditions on unions, which have long been a Democratic stronghold. It could be an early test of character for the new administration. 
 In the first five minutes of his first news conference as our future president, Mr. Obama said that his administration would not allow the auto industry to die. Who can disagree with that ideal? Who wants to live in a country without the kind of decent middle-class jobs -- and industry might -- that auto has always represented? 
 To their credit, most of those calling for a General Motors bankruptcy are trying to help save the auto industry, not destroy it. They are saying that bankruptcy is the only way they can see to get from here to there. And maybe it is. Maybe after 50 years of accumulated legacy costs, encrusted bureaucracy and mistakes, General Motors needs the harsh slap of bankruptcy to force on it the kind of change in culture and mind-set that it will take to compete in the future. 
 But let's not go down that road until there truly is no other choice. We're not there yet.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 26, 2008

 CORRECTION:
The Talking Business column on Saturday, about the prospects for restructuring American automakers, referred incorrectly to the work of Edward I. Altman, a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University, who commented on the difficulty of a prepackaged bankruptcy for General Motors. He uses mathematical models to assess the financial health of companies and the market; he does not run a bankruptcy prediction service.

HEADLINE: Bush, in Peru, Will Press Plans to Avert Future Financial Crises

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru 

 BODY:
President Bush, confessing he already ''felt a little nostalgic,'' began what could be his last official overseas trip on Friday with the aim of building a broad international consensus for the regulatory reform agenda adopted by leaders of the 20 nations who attended his global economic summit meeting in Washington last week. 
 Mr. Bush arrived in Lima for yet another financial meeting, the gathering of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, which begins Saturday. Aides said he hoped to persuade the leaders of Asia-Pacific nations, a dozen of whom did not attend last week's summit meeting, to endorse the so-called ''Washington declaration'' that came out of it. In that declaration, the leaders agreed to a general framework for bolstering financial institutions in an effort to prevent another financial meltdown.
 The weekend jaunt -- Mr. Bush is planning to be back in Washington on Sunday night -- is the last scheduled foreign trip of the Bush presidency. But there is some expectation in Washington that the president could make a trip to Iraq to thank soldiers for their service.
 Although the nation is focused on the transition to the Obama administration, and just two months remain until Mr. Bush leaves office, his aides insist the Peru visit will be substantive. Ending North Korea's nuclear ambitions remains high on his agenda, they say; in one sign of that, Mr. Bush slipped into a closed-door meeting with President Hu Jintao of China shortly after arriving here on Friday, appearing only briefly with Mr. Hu for a photo opportunity that lasted seven seconds, his only public appearance here on Friday.
 Dana M. Perino, the White House press secretary, said afterward that Mr. Bush opened the meeting by telling Mr. Hu that he ''felt a little nostalgic,'' given that this was their last meeting as heads of state. 
 She said Mr. Bush urged Mr. Hu to work toward a formal ''verification protocol,'' by which the United States, China and other nations that are engaged in the so-called six-party talks with North Korea could verify that it was living up to its promises to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. North Korea announced last week that it would bar international nuclear inspectors from taking soil and nuclear waste samples, considered crucial to determining the extent of its program.
 Mr. Bush once had hopes of presiding over an end to the program before he left office. Instead, his senior adviser on North Korea, Dennis Wilder, told reporters on Air Force One on the way here on Friday that Mr. Bush now hoped to leave ''a very viable six-party process'' that President-elect Barack Obama can build on once he takes office.

HEADLINE: Geithner Said To Be Choice; Wall St. Cheers

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES; Ben White and Vikas Bajaj contributed reporting from New York, and Mark Landler from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama will name Timothy F. Geithner, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, to be his Treasury secretary, moving to fill a key post at a moment when the quavering financial markets are looking for reassurance about the direction of economic policy, people briefed about the decision said Friday.
 In picking Mr. Geithner, who has been at the center of efforts to contain the financial crisis, Mr. Obama passed over Lawrence H. Summers, who was Treasury secretary in the final year and a half of the Clinton administration. The president-elect might name Mr. Summers, a highly regarded economist and a former president of Harvard University, as a senior White House adviser, people involved in the transition said.
 Word of Mr. Geithner's selection helped drive stocks sharply higher on Friday afternoon as investors concluded that Mr. Obama was taking steps to fill a leadership vacuum at a time when the economy and financial markets are showing new signs of strain. The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 494 points, a 6.5 percent gain after days of dizzying declines. 
 With Congress having left town on Friday after doing little to address the deteriorating economy and President Bush opposing additional steps, Mr. Obama was under increasing pressure to signal his intentions and flesh out his team to deal with a crisis that now has financial institutions and automakers struggling to survive and that shows signs of deflation as fearful consumers quit spending. Mr. Obama is expected to announce his selection of Mr. Geithner, and perhaps other economic advisers, on Monday.
 David Kotok, chairman of the money-management firm Cumberland Advisors in Vineland, N.J., welcomed the news about Mr. Geithner in particular, but he attributed the market rally to relief that Mr. Obama seemed to have made a decision. ''The most important thing for the market and for the economy is that these decisions are made and uncertainty is removed,'' Mr. Kotok said. ''It probably would have been the same rally had it been someone else on the short list.''
 Mr. Obama said days after his election on Nov. 4 that he would try to name his economic and national security teams more quickly than past presidents-elect, given that the country is in a worsening recession and fighting two wars. The job of Treasury secretary, always one of the most prestigious in the cabinet, has gained outsize stature as the economy has continued to weaken and the Treasury secretary has been put in charge of a $700 billion financial bailout program.
 Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers emerged quickly as the unlikely rivals for the post. Mr. Geithner once worked for Mr. Summers, who promoted the younger man at the Treasury Department when Mr. Summers was first deputy secretary and then secretary.
 Mr. Obama does not know either man well, but he knows Mr. Summers better because Mr. Summers was an occasional economic adviser during the presidential campaign and was named to Mr. Obama's economic advisory board for the transition.
 But people close to Mr. Obama say that he clicked with Mr. Geithner during a recent private meeting. The two men are the same age, 47, and Mr. Obama is closer temperamentally to the low-key and almost boyish Mr. Geithner than to the more tightly wound Mr. Summers. Mr. Summers, who will be 54 on Nov. 30, is universally described as brilliant, but is also renowned for being arrogant, occasionally rude and sometimes difficult to work with. 
 He left Harvard's presidency after controversies that alienated faculty and women's groups. Several feminist leaders in Washington said they had registered objections about Mr. Summers to the Obama team, but were not going all out to oppose him.
 As a special White House adviser to Mr. Obama, however, Mr. Summers could have influence rivaling the Treasury secretary's own. That would be doubly true if he were viewed as the nation's next central banker: two Obama advisers say Mr. Summers would be the leading candidate to become the next Federal Reserve chairman should Mr. Obama choose not to reappoint Ben S. Bernanke when Mr. Bernanke's term ends Jan. 31, 2010.
 In choosing Mr. Geithner, Mr. Obama would signal both a change at the Treasury Department and continuity in its economic rescue efforts. With the current Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., and Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Geithner -- who as head of the New York Fed is the central bank's eyes and ears on Wall Street -- has been part of a troika that has struggled this year to contain the credit crisis. 
 ''You can't bring in a guy who needs on-the-job training,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard who once worked with Mr. Geithner at the International Monetary Fund.
 Along with Mr. Paulson and Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Geithner has come under criticism for the original construction of the $700 billion bailout plan, which had to be overhauled and has so far failed to remedy the financial crisis. 
 But his association with the current administration's policies is balanced by his close connections to the centrist Democratic policies of President Bill Clinton and Mr. Clinton's best-known Treasury secretary, Robert E. Rubin. Mr. Geithner served under Mr. Rubin as well as Mr. Summers at the Treasury Department in the 1990s, and rose to be under secretary for international affairs. 
 Rubin proteges in fact are likely to dominate the Obama economic team. In addition to Mr. Geithner and Mr. Summers, Mr. Obama is expected to name as his budget director Peter R. Orszag, a Clinton administration economist and Rubin ally who is now head of the Congressional Budget Office.
 Michael Froman, Mr. Rubin's former Treasury chief of staff and Mr. Obama's classmate at Harvard Law School, is heading the economics personnel search for the transition. Mr. Froman's head-hunting deputy is Mr. Rubin's son, James Rubin. 
 Paul Calello, chief executive of the investment bank at Credit Suisse, said Mr. Geithner ''has the intellect, the experience and the ability to work across many constituencies that you need in that job. It's also important to note that Tim has both the domestic and international experience that is going to be very important going forward.''
 The Rubin wing of the Democratic Party has long been disparaged by liberals and union leaders as being too concerned with balanced budgets and free trade. But much of the ideological tension in the party has dissipated as the economy has weakened, and Mr. Obama has signaled that he intends to spend what it takes to get the economy back on track.
 Mr. Geithner also seems to fit Mr. Obama's emphasis on ''post-partisanship.'' Associates say Mr. Geithner is an independent, though he was a Republican when he first was a staff member at the Treasury Department in the late 1980s under Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush. After college, he worked in the New York-based international consulting firm headed by Henry A. Kissinger.
 After leaving the Treasury Department, Mr. Geithner worked at the International Monetary Fund until he was hired in 2003 as president of the New York Fed. 
 As the bank's president, Mr. Geithner has had a seat on the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets short-term interest rates. He spent two years studying the complexities of the new credit derivatives that spread financial risk, but also exacerbated the economic downturn when the credit squeeze set in.
 ''The fact that the banks are stronger and risk is spread more broadly should make the system more stable,'' Mr. Geithner said in an interview in early 2007. ''We can't know that with certainty, though. We'll have a test of that when things next threaten to fall apart.''
 The test began later that year as the housing credit crisis took hold. Working closely with Mr. Bernanke, Mr. Geithner early this year engineered the $30 billion bailout of Bear Stearns. Since September, the two of them and Mr. Paulson together have steered the government takeover of the mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, bailouts of American International Group and a number of financial institutions, and the design of the $700 billion bailout program. 
 Mr. Geithner has also had a part in some high-profile missteps, including the government's decision to allow Lehman Brothers to fail; some experts say that destabilized markets and helped to spread the financial contagion globally. 
 ''He knows better than almost anyone else the ins and outs of the bailout,'' said Simon Johnson, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''The question is, whether that's an advantage or a disadvantage.''
 On the plus side, Mr. Johnson said Mr. Geithner could begin working with Mr. Paulson almost from the moment his appointment is announced on how to deploy the remaining $410 billion in the bailout fund.
 ''The markets will remain disrupted through Jan. 20 without some thoughtful government action,'' said Todd Steinberg, head of equities and commodity derivatives at BNP Paribas Americas. ''The naming of Geithner certainly increases the possibility of action for a couple of reasons: he is in the government in one of the most influential seats, and he is already actively in dialogue with the current administration's decision makers.''

HEADLINE: Shares Falling, Citigroup Talks To Government

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN and LOUISE STORY

 BODY:
With the sharp stock-market decline for Citigroup rapidly becoming a full-blown crisis of confidence, the company's executives on Friday entered into talks with federal officials about how to stabilize the struggling financial giant. 
 In a series of tense meetings and telephone calls, the executives and officials weighed several options, including whether to replace Citigroup's chief executive, Vikram S. Pandit, or sell all or part of the company. 
 Other options discussed included a public endorsement from the government or a new financial lifeline, people involved in the talks said.
 The course of action, however, remained uncertain on Friday night, these people said, and other options may yet emerge. But after a year of gaping losses and an accelerating decline in share price, Citigroup, which has $2 trillion in assets and operations in scores of countries, is running out of time, analysts said. 
 After a board meeting early Friday morning, Citigroup's management and some board members held several calls with Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, and with the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Timothy F. Geithner, who later emerged as President-elect Barack Obama's choice to be Treasury secretary.
 As Citigroup's stock sank during the day, falling 68 cents to close at $3.87, the Federal Reserve was carefully monitoring how much money corporations and other customers were withdrawing from the bank, people involved in the discussions said. 
 The Fed was trying to ascertain whether the tumult in the stock market could escalate into something worse. 
 So far, these people said, most customers and clients remained committed to Citigroup.
 But with Citigroup's troubles opening a new chapter in the long-running financial crisis, government officials said that the Treasury Department was considering whether to ask for the second half of the $700 billion rescue fund approved by Congress in September. 
 It was unclear whether any of that money would be used to make a cash infusion into Citigroup, which received $25 billion from the government in October. A second financial rescue for banks might be difficult politically at a time that the struggling auto industry is being turned away in Washington. 
 As Citigroup's fortunes diminished on Friday, Mr. Pandit, the company's embattled chief executive, went on the offensive. He worked the phones and held a companywide call to shore up the confidence of anxious employees. 
 Later in the day, the company held a similar call with large corporate customers. On Sunday, Citigroup plans to run full-page advertisements in major newspapers that acknowledge ''our financial markets have been tested in unprecedented ways,'' but argue that the company has a broad range of businesses and enough management expertise to pull through. In a nod to the company's slogan, the text concludes: ''That's why now, more than ever, you can feel confident that Citi never sleeps.''
 Still, Citigroup's executives are not expected to sleep much this weekend as they continue to pursue contingency plans, including what they might need to calm anxious investors before the stock market opens on Monday morning. 
 One maneuver that Mr. Pandit has championed is for the Securities and Exchange Commission to reinstate the ''uptick rule,'' which prevents short-sellers from betting against companies whose stock price is falling. Mr. Pandit has been lobbying the S.E.C. for the past week, as have other Wall Street chiefs. 
 Mr. Pandit and others have suggested that Citigroup is a victim of short-sellers, which some have blamed for speeding the demise of other financial companies this year. 
 In September, Richard X. Bove, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann, predicted that short-sellers would turn their attention to larger and larger financial companies, including Citigroup, which he said at the time was strong enough to withstand the pressure. 
 ''They're going to hit a company that is too well grounded, too well capitalized, and I think that will be Citigroup,'' he said. Still, while Citigroup is widely regarded as too big and too interconnected to be allowed to fail, its immediate future is uncertain. Executives at other financial firms said that there are not many options left, and that Citigroup's stock has reached a level that may force government action. 
 ''The reason you have to 'save' Citibank is you cannot allow this hysteria,'' said Peter J. Solomon, chairman of the Peter J. Solomon Company, a small investment bank.
 Investors and executives at other banks said that one way the bank might be able to give itself some breathing room would be for Mr. Pandit, who became chief executive less than a year ago, to step down. 
 Executives in New York have also begun pointing out that Citigroup has a huge global presence. They suggested that perhaps a government bailout should involve money from other countries in addition to the United States.
 ''If there's a flight from Citi's stock, that's unfortunate, but I don't think that's the government's business,'' said David M. Walker, the president of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation and a former United States comptroller general.
 Mr. Walker said that the government should be concerned about Citigroup only if there were a run on the bank that threatened the financial system. The government should not, he said, be concerned about shareholders. 
 Some executives, however, argued that it was important to protect Citigroup's shareholders because if they lose their investment, that will send other bank stocks diving.
 Among the other ideas being bandied about Washington and the halls of Citigroup would be an assisted merger between Citigroup and another major bank. The merger might be structured with government assistance based on the blueprint that was developed for the Wachovia and Citigroup merger. 
 That deal ultimately did not go through because Wells Fargo stepped in with a higher offer, but it would have involved the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation sharing the losses on $312 billion of Wachovia's loans with Citigroup. Citigroup would have absorbed the first $42 billion in losses, and the government would have absorbed the rest. The F.D.I.C. would have been given $12 billion in warrants and preferred shares of Citigroup in exchange.
 That structure could be used in a merger, but this time around, the government would be absorbing losses on Citigroup's loans. But it remains unclear what other bank is in a strong enough position to merge with Citigroup.
 Inside Citigroup on Friday, some angry senior executives said that the government had ''allowed'' Wells Fargo to take Wachovia from them, people at the firm said. They argued that had Citigroup and Wachovia been allowed to merge ''we wouldn't be in this position,'' one executive said. 
 Another option might be for the government to purchase a large chunk of Citigroup's assets in one swoop. Such an action could be structured similarly to the proposed deal in Switzerland for UBS. A spokesman for UBS, Mark Arena, said on Friday that the arrangement would allow UBS to have ''one of the cleanest balance sheets of our peers.'' 
 At the time of the deal's announcement in October, Jean-Pierre Roth, president of the Swiss National Bank, said the government had the time to wait for the values of the assets to improve. ''UBS does not have time,'' Mr. Roth said.

HEADLINE: Hints of Relief From the Siege

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Caught flat-footed by the latest panic in the financial markets and a potentially life-threatening crisis at Citigroup, the Treasury Department is planning another round of emergency measures intended to restore normalcy.
 Just Tuesday, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. told a Congressional committee that the government had ''turned the corner as far as stabilizing the system'' and that he did not plan to announce any new rescue efforts from the $700 billion bailout program.
 But on Friday, after two days of carnage in the financial markets in which Citigroup's stock sank to almost $3 a share, Treasury officials insisted that Mr. Paulson had been misunderstood. The Treasury was indeed working on new initiatives, they said, and would announce them as soon as they were ready. 
 Those new rescue efforts, as well as others being developed by the Federal Reserve, could gain new momentum from President-elect Barack Obama's anticipated decision to name Timothy F. Geithner as the next Treasury secretary. Talk of Mr. Geithner's appointment provided a rare bit of heartening news for financial markets, which have been troubled by the uncertainty of the presidential transition.
 Mr. Geithner, who is currently president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has been a central decision maker in most of the rescue efforts over the last year and promises a measure of continuity. Because he already holds a crucial policy-making post, Mr. Geithner could bridge the transition between the Bush administration and the incoming Obama administration. 
 With credit markets still in distress, Mr. Paulson, who has formed a close relationship with Mr. Geithner, is working with the Federal Reserve to have the government underwrite big pools of consumer debt, like car loans and credit card debt. Treasury officials also signaled that they would soon be asking Congress for the second half of the $700 billion it authorized in early October. Recently, Mr. Paulson told reporters that he had no ''timeline'' for requesting the money.
 The ever-changing direction and momentum of the so-called Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, at the Treasury has baffled many industry executives. In recent days, a growing number of analysts has worried that the interregnum between President Bush and Mr. Obama had created a dangerous vacuum in policy-making.
 Ethan Harris, an senior economist at Barclays Capital, said the Treasury seemed to be off balance in recent days. ''Why announce that the TARP funds will not be used to buy distressed assets,'' he asked. ''Why not just do a limited implementation of the program? Why show any hesitation about asking for more TARP funds?''
 Some economists likened Mr. Paulson's statement about not asking Congress for more money to a central bank, clumsily showing its cards by signaling that it would not defend the exchange rate of a currency. That often sets off precisely the sort of speculative attack on the currency that the bank wants to avoid.
 In Mr. Paulson's case this week, economists suggested that his testimony before Congress had led to a sell-off in the stock markets. 
 ''He created a one-way bet,'' said Simon Johnson, a professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''Investors said, 'Let's just sell the equity and debt, and come back later.' ''
 With credit markets still paralyzed and banks' shares still swooning, Mr. Johnson said the government would probably have to do a second round of capital injections. But that may only be the start, as Treasury and the Fed reach for additional tools to stem the crisis.
 Treasury and Fed officials are under intense pressure from Congress to spend money on reducing foreclosures. 
 Though Mr. Paulson has thus far rejected proposals for a big rescue package aimed at homeowners, Fed and Treasury officials are trying to come up with ideas that will be viewed as more than window-dressing.
 Experts said the government may have to act on multiple fronts, perhaps including an outright nationalization of major banks and much more aggressive efforts to stimulate the economy. 
 ''This may well involve nationalizing some of the largest banks, starting with Citigroup,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a professor of economics at Harvard. ''It will mean spending trillions of dollars.''
 With the economy in a free fall, Mr. Rogoff said the current bailout was ''underpowered.'' Housing prices continue to drop. The next wave of defaults, he said, could hit hedge funds and private-equity investors.
 ''The financial system has been on a Federal Reserve respirator for months,'' Mr. Rogoff said. ''When a patient has not really recovered and is taken off a respirator, it can be very difficult.''
 At the Federal Reserve, meanwhile, policy makers are intensively preparing for the possibility a new era in monetary policy in which they must try to fight a recession after having already reduced the Fed's benchmark interest rate to zero.
 Last month, the central bank lowered its official target for the Fed funds rate to just 1 percent, its lowest level since 2004. But the Fed has already pumped so much money into the banking system -- more than $1 trillion in the last year -- that the actual overnight rate has slipped as low as one-quarter of a percent on several recent days.
 On Friday, federal banking regulators announced two other measures aimed at shoring up confidence among banks and helping them attract more capital.
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation strengthened its emergency guarantee program on bank deposits, interbank loans and certain senior unsecured debt that banks issue.
 The rules, initially announced on Oct. 15, were intended to eliminate much of the fear that had stopped banks from lending money to each other and had raised anxiety among businesses about keeping money in bank deposits. But the final rules adopted on Friday strengthen the federal guarantee and are expected to make it easier for banks to issue bonds.
 In a separate move, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced that it would allow private equity firms to apply for bank charters. That change is intended to make it easier for private equity firms to buy up failed banks that the government has taken over.

 LOST PENSION DATA MAY BE LINK 
 To Grisly Killings in Tokyo
 The grisly knifing death of a former official at the Japanese health ministry and his wife, and the wounding of the wife of another former ministry official may be linked to a scandal involving lost pension records, officials say. The lost records stirred outrage when they came to light last year, and the attacks have gripped national attention. PAGE A6
 BUSH SEEKING FINANCIAL CONSENSUS
 President Bush, confessing he already ''felt a little nostalgic,'' flew to Peru for what could be his last overseas trip. His aim was to build a broad international consensus for the regulatory reform agenda adopted by leaders of 20 nations who attended his global economic summit in Washington last week. The gathering is of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. PAGE A6 
 BURMESE COMEDIAN SENTENCED
 A secret court run by Myanmar's military leadership sentenced a prominent Burmese comedian and dissident to 45 years in prison. The comedian, U Maung Thura, was detained after he organized an effort to help victims of the May cyclone and criticized the government's handling of the disaster. Some 150 antigovernment activists have received prison sentences of two to 65 years in the past three weeks. PAGE A6

 Week after week, John Sergeant, a broadcast journalist by trade, won the hearts and votes of viewers despite the scorn of judges with his bungling, stumbling efforts on the BBC's top-rated weekend television program, ''Strictly Come Dancing,'' the inspiration for ''Dancing With the Stars.'' But, fearful of actually winning the competition, he has withdrawn. PAGE A7
 FORMER MEXICO DRUG CZAR CHARGED
 The former senior antidrug official in Mexico, Noe Ramirez Mandujano, has been arrested and accused of accepting bribes from a drug cartel and passing along information about investigations and actions against it, the authorities said. Mr. Ramirez is the highest-ranking official to come under suspicion in a purge related to possible ties to drug traffickers. PAGE A6
 IRAQIS PROTEST SECURITY PACT
 More than 10,000 Iraqis, mostly supporters of the radical Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, gathered in Baghdad to protest the security agreement with the United States that the Parliament is scheduled to vote on on Monday. Its passage depends on whether Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki can calm the opposition's fury, as well as get some support from Iraq's Sunni minority, many of whom are nervous about seeing American troops depart, fearing Iran and its Shiite allies in Baghdad.

 PSYCHIATRIST AND RADIO HOST
 Is Linked to Drug Companies
 Dr. Frederick K. Goodwin, an influential psychiatrist who served as the host of the popular NPR program ''The Infinite Mind,'' earned at least $1.3 million from 2000 to 2007 giving marketing lectures for drug makers, income not mentioned on the program. He is the latest in a series of doctors and researchers whose ties to drug makers have been uncovered by Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. PAGE A14
 NEWSSTAND TO BECOME OLD NEWS
 When word spread this week that Out of Town News, the iconic newsstand just outside Harvard's gates in Cambridge, Mass., might close, the legions who love Harvard Square went numb. For decades, the copper-roofed kiosk has not only sold newspapers from around the world, but has also been one of Greater Boston's favorite meeting spots. But the building's tenant has decided not to renew its lease, saying the business is no longer profitable. PAGE A10
 ARIZONA CASE REACHES WORLDWIDE
 The case of an 8-year-old Arizona boy accused of killing his father and another man this month has attracted international attention after prosecutors released to the news media copies of a videotape of the boy confessing during a police interview. It is very unlikely that the videotape will be admissible in court, according to legal experts and child psychologists. PAGE A10
 STUDENTS BURNED IN HAZING
 Seven students at New England College, in Henniker, N.H., have been severely burned in a fraternity hazing ceremony, the police and officials there say. Not only is hazing illegal in New Hampshire, but those who have been hazed face misdemeanor charges if they do not report it. PAGE A11
 MUKASEY RELEASED FROM HOSPITAL
 Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey was released from George Washington University Hospital and returned to work at the Justice Department after having what aides said was a fainting spell in the middle of a speech the night before.

 Nine months ago it was a dream for David A. Paterson, then the lieutenant governor, that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton would head to the White House and he would be tapped to fill her Senate seat. But now Mr. Paterson, who became governor in March after Eliot Spitzer resigned, will be the one picking a replacement for Mrs. Clinton, who is said to be poised to become the next secretary of state. And the only thing he is sure of is that he will not appoint himself. PAGE A16

 Saturday's top college football matchups include in-state rivals Utah, unbeaten and ranked No. 7 in the Bowl Championship Series standings, and B.Y.U., which has lost only to Texas Christian and is ranked 14th in the B.C.S.; and No. 2 Texas Tech, which hopes to continue its magical and improbable run toward the national title game with a victory at No. 5 Oklahoma. Major bowl bids could well be at stake for all involved. PAGE D1
 DAVIS CUP AT 1-1
 For a match and a set, it was all going so well for Argentina in its bid to finally win the Davis Cup. In the first match, David Nalbandian dominated David Ferrer, requiring just under two hours to give Argentina a quick 1-0 lead. And for a set, his young compatriot Juan Del Potro was blasting serves and looking surprisingly fresh for someone who was playing tennis in faraway Shanghai just last week. Then things caught up with the home team. PAGE D2 
 SORENSTAM WAVES GOODBYE
 Annika Sorenstam, 38, may have preferred a more victorious ending to her majestic career, but there could hardly have been a more winsome one.

 RAINMAKERS FOR BARCLAYS
 Making Millions in the Middle
 With Barclays stock down more than 70 percent this year, top company executives have given up their bonuses. But Roger Jenkins, who runs the hugely profitable tax arbitrage unit, and Amanda Staveley, a 35-year-old independent financier, know that the way to tens of millions of dollars is to be a rainmaker with Middle Eastern investors.

 SCOLDED G.M. TO RETURN 2 JETS
 After coming under criticism in Washington along with other automakers for traveling there in private jets to lobby for a bailout, General Motors has decided to return two of its leased corporate jets. G.M. said that the timing is coincidental -- that it had already been in the process of returning two of its corporate jets after cost-cutting eliminated two others last September. PAGE B3
 RETHINKING HOLIDAY GIVING

 WAL-MART CHIEF TO RETIRE
 After nearly a decade as chief executive of Wal-Mart Stores, H. Lee Scott Jr. plans to retire at the end of January. Perhaps the most notable thing Mr. Scott did during his tenure as chief executive was to directly address the company's critics, even setting up a war room of public relations professionals. Wal-Mart's international chief, Michael T. Duke, above, will be the next chief executive and president. The move comes at a high point for Wal-Mart, one of the few retailers thriving in this economy.

 SAILING AGAINST THE ENERGY TIDE
 When crude oil rose above $140 a barrel in July, analysts forecast even higher prices. Betting against that consensus by selling energy stocks would have paid off. And now, with crude below $50, the opposite play, equally contrarian, might be profitable. Shares of many suppliers of oil and natural gas have lost half their value or more in the stock market's race to the bottom, and may be good buys. PAGE B6
 A GIFT WRAPPED IN RISK
 You may think the term ''unsecured creditor'' has no particular application to you. But if you are in possession of a gift card from a retailer, and that retailer happens to go bankrupt in these perilous economic times, you may learn different.

HEADLINE: For Reinvention, Red Hook Follows Its Roots

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Red Hook piers, one of the last working waterfronts in New York, have seemed destined for the kind of high-gloss gentrification that was enveloping much of the city. Cargo piers would become marinas and cruise ship terminals; warehouses would be transformed into restaurants, luxury condominiums and corporate conference centers. 
 But the Bloomberg administration, which once actively fostered that upscale vision for the waterfront, has begun moving toward maintaining and even expanding maritime industry in Brooklyn, from Red Hook to Sunset Park. 
 Where a developer once hoped to build a fancy marina, the city now plans to install a beer and wine importer. Nearby, a cement company has opened a shipping terminal. The container port at the north end of Red Hook is planning to expand. And the city expects to sign a deal to open an automobile shipping and storage operation at the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal. 
 ''I'm personally very committed to seeing that the Brooklyn waterfront remains a working port,'' said Seth W. Pinsky, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. He said that the administration's new view was not a retreat from previous plans but a recognition of changing conditions and ''because it makes sense for the Brooklyn waterfront.''
 Those changing conditions have both practical and political roots. The credit crunch and slowing economy have deterred new development. Influential politicians, led by Representative Jerrold L. Nadler, have fought to preserve a dwindling supply of high-paying longshoreman jobs and the waterfront's ability to handle water-borne freight. And the operator of the Red Hook container port successfully foiled the city's attempts to oust it.
 Beyond those factors, the Bloomberg administration seems more determined to maintain and even expand the number of blue-collar jobs on the waterfront, perhaps because Wall Street and the real estate industry are in turmoil. Shipping more cargo to Brooklyn will also reduce truck traffic into the city, officials say. 
 The city's interest in preserving the area as a cargo port would seem to conflict with its repeated efforts to remove the operator of the Red Hook container port, American Stevedoring. The city wanted to replace the port's warehouses and gantry cranes with light industry, restaurants, marinas, stores and warehouse retailers. But American Stevedoring resisted, and with Mr. Nadler's help, recently negotiated a new 10-year lease with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for Piers 7 through 10, between Atlantic Avenue and Sackett Street. 
 Next week, American Stevedoring says it will announce that it has signed contracts with four new shipping lines, including Seaboard, to unload a combined 168,000 containers in Red Hook in 2009. The company had seen its business dwindle during its four-year battle for a new lease, and its supporters say that even a modest expansion of its business would mean new waterfront jobs. 
 ''We need a major port in Brooklyn,'' Mr. Nadler said. ''This is just the start of it. It means a lot of jobs and gives us a major industrial base that will make up for some of the losses on Wall Street, if we do it right.''
 One project that has not met expectations is the cruise ship terminal at Pier 12. Built four years ago for $56 million, the terminal has generated the equivalent of 60 full-time jobs, not the 600 the city once promised. Since then, the city has abandoned plans to create another cruise ship terminal on Pier 10 or 11.
 Mr. Pinsky said the city was finalizing a long-delayed agreement with the Axis Group for a scaled-down $30 million automobile processing center and general cargo operation on 74 acres at the dilapidated marine terminal in Sunset Park. Critics have questioned the wisdom of creating what is essentially a car park, especially when unsold foreign cars are beginning to pile up at ports across the country. But Mr. Pinsky insists that Axis will provide good union jobs.
 Three weeks ago, city officials also notified developers that it was scrapping plans to develop marinas, art galleries, restaurants and ferry landings in Atlantic Basin, a protected cove in Red Hook encompassing Piers 10, 11 and 12.
 Instead, the Bloomberg administration wants to move Phoenix Beverages to Pier 11 from Long Island City under a sole-source contract. Phoenix has sought for seven years to move to Red Hook, close to the freighters that bring containers of Heineken, Guinness and Amstel beer. 
 Most of Phoenix's shipments are now unloaded in New Jersey, packed onto tractor-trailers and driven into the city. Mr. Pinsky estimated there would be 20,000 fewer tractor-trailer trips in the city if Phoenix moved to Red Hook, although there would still be thousands of delivery trucks navigating neighborhood streets.
 Not everyone is happy with the trend to preserve the waterfront as a working port. The developer Bruce Batkin submitted a bid last year in line with the city's prior vision of transforming the gritty area into a more upscale district. 
 ''I am befuddled,'' Mr. Batkin said.
 In March, Mr. Batkin won a five-year court battle to build condominiums in a six-story industrial building on Imlay Street, facing Atlantic Basin. Now he is worried his apartments will someday overlook a fleet of delivery trucks instead of sailboats.
 In a sign of how complex the politics of development in Red Hook can be, the city's decision to put Phoenix Beverages on Pier 11 has been criticized even by those who would like to see the company on the Red Hook waterfront. 
 Two of those people, John McGettrick, president of the Red Hook Civic Association, and Greg O'Connell, chairman of the local community board's waterfront committee and a prominent landlord, favor a proposal from another developer, Douglas Durst, for Pier 11 and Atlantic Basin.
 Mr. Durst proposed creating a maritime center there that would include a home base for his ferry company, New York Water Taxi; ship maintenance and repair shops; a fuel barge; marina; esplanade; and ferry link to Governors Island.
 Mr. McGettrick said that the Durst plan would bring new jobs and public access to the waterfront, while Phoenix would inundate the surrounding neighborhood with beer delivery trucks. He and others suggest that Phoenix is better suited for American Stevedoring's Pier 7, which is where the company's officials have long wanted to go anyway. Once the largest cocoa pier in the country, Pier 7 is close to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and is now largely dormant.
 ''I believe that our plan for Atlantic Basin is important to the growth of the maritime industry and connecting Red Hook to its waterfront,'' said Tom Fox, the chief executive of New York Water Taxi. ''I hope that some kind of accommodation can be made.''
 Gregory J. Brayman, whose family owns Phoenix, said only that his distributorship ''really needed to be on the waterfront.''
 Matt Yates, a director of American Stevedoring, said the company is willing to put Phoenix on Pier 7 as long as it could get some of the warehouse space on Pier 11, which is now vacant. The ferry fleet, he said, could use the rest of the warehouse as a boathouse.
 Sandy Pope, the president of Teamsters Local 805, which represents warehouse workers on the docks, said that leadership is needed to find a way to best accommodate all of the interested parties. ''Somebody's got to twist some arms,'' she said. ''There's a good solution. It's ridiculous that this will blow up because of some bad blood.''
 Sabato F. Catucci, the tough-talking 70-year-old president of American Stevedoring, has generally fought the city at every turn. Yet he said he is ready to work out a deal now that the city and the Port Authority ''are looking at this in a better way than they did a few years ago.'' 
 ''At the time, real estate was booming,'' he said. ''Housing was going up. Now jobs are important. We've changed too. We were out there fighting everyone. Now we're out there trying to make it work.''

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
In the week since The Chronicle of Higher Education published its annual survey of university presidents' pay -- a week in which the nation's economic troubles worsened -- several of the highest-paid presidents said that they would give back part of their pay or forgo their raises. 
 Pat Callan, president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education, said he had never heard of such a wave of givebacks. 
 ''When you see a cluster like this,'' he said, ''it seems like sort of belated recognition that this presidential pay thing has gotten out of hand. People are getting tuition increases, some faculty are facing layoffs, it just doesn't look too good for presidents, no matter how capable they are, to be getting so much money. Americans have had a touching faith in higher education; it's losing its good image with the public.''
 The chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis, Mark S. Wrighton, announced on Thursday that he would take a 5 percent cut from his base salary on Jan. 1 and another 5 percent reduction on July 1. 
 Mr. Wrighton, who announced his decision in an e-mail message to the university community, also pointed out that the university's endowment had declined about 25 percent since July 1, that some capital projects were being delayed and that faculty salary increases would be lower than in past years. 
 Mr. Wrighton said he had a base salary of about $560,000 and a total compensation package of about $780,000. He also earns about $360,000 from serving on two corporate boards. 
 ''This was well under way before The Chronicle came out,'' Mr. Wrighton said. ''I'm generously compensated, I know that. We're in very difficult financial times. I'm in a position that is not at risk, but the rest of the university community, especially in administration and support, must be wondering if their jobs are secure. I wanted to let the community know that I'm sensitive to the situation.'' 
 On Tuesday, Amy Gutmann, the president of the University of Pennsylvania, and her husband made a $100,000 gift to the university to support undergraduate research. Ms. Gutmann was one of eight private university presidents earning more than $1 million in 2006, a 40 percent increase from the previous year's pay, according to the Chronicle survey. 
 In Washington state, where there is talk of deep cuts in financing of higher education, the two highest-paid university presidents announced givebacks last week, as well. 
 Mark Emmert, the president of the University of Washington -- and the nation's second-highest-paid public university president, according to the Chronicle survey -- forwent a raise this year. Mr. Emmert is paid about $900,000 a year from the university, plus $340,000 for serving on two corporate boards. 
 The president of Washington State University, Elson S. Floyd, who made $600,000 in his first year at the university and received a $125,000 raise over the summer, said he would take a voluntary $100,000 pay cut in response to budget problems. 
 The median salary for public university presidents was $427,400, The Chronicle said. 
 Several other college executives have taken similar actions.

HEADLINE: 'The Most Zestful Spectacle'

BYLINE: By MATT WEILAND. 
Matt Weiland has been an editor on The Paris Review, Granta and The Baffler. He is the co-editor, with Sean Wilsey, of ''State by State: A Panoramic Portrait of America.''

 BODY:
The best magazines are not just the product of their editors' tastes and curiosities, but of the time and place in which they are made. Readers of The Edinburgh Review in the 19th century or The New Yorker in the 20th (and beyond) walked those cities' streets, even -- especially -- when the piece on the page wasn't set there. The same may be said of the young Dublin Review, founded in 2001, which feels pleasantly pickled in that city's brine. 
 But even magazines without a city in their name are made somewhere, after all -- and the sly barmaids at the pub around the corner or the drunks stumbling behind the Dumpster out back may have as much to do with the sound and subject matter of the magazine as anything else. Take H.L. Mencken's American Mercury, which captured the gaudy, gorgeous America of the 1920s and 30s. It was edited largely from Mencken's Baltimore home and, in its taunting tone toward New York self-importance, felt that way. Or Horizon, the incomparable English magazine edited by Cyril Connolly and published throughout the Second World War. I once bought a box of moldering copies in a West Village bookshop; flipping through them at home I was pretty sure I could hear the buzzing of a V-1 bomb overhead. Or Processed World, the pioneering magazine that scathingly satirized workplace culture throughout the 1980s, documenting at ground level and in real time the enormous shift from manufacturing to a service economy. Inspired by the Situationists as well as by the environmental and women's movements, it was the sort of magazine that could be sold on the street by vendors wearing papier-mache computer monitors on their heads. In other words, a very San Francisco magazine. 
 Selections from all these magazines have been published over the years in handsome, lasting book form. To their proud ranks we may now add The Chicagoan: A Lost Magazine of the Jazz Age (University of Chicago, $65), which rescues the periodical of the same name from what the historian E.P. Thompson once called the ''enormous condescension of posterity.'' Haven't heard of the magazine before? You're not alone. It was founded in 1926 by a group of Chicagoans inflamed by the example and success of The New Yorker, which had begun the year before. It was published every two weeks,and before long Time magazine was heralding it for having the ''finish and flair worthy of a national publication.'' But its readership began to decline as the Great Depression set in, its frequency was reduced to monthly, and in 1935 it died a quiet death. Somehow this vibrant magazine was completely forgotten until a few years ago, when the distinguished cultural historian Neil Harris came upon a set of the magazine's run in the library of the University of Chicago. It has now been brought back into print, if not to life, by the University of Chicago Press. 
 What a marvelous job they've done! This is a book you'll want to own, a coffee-table book nicer and better made than most coffee tables. The University of Chicago Press has swung for the fences, producing the book to the highest standards -- a nearly 400-page oversize volume, designed with care and attentiveness to period detail and featuring loads of full-color images. It's a pleasure to see the ball sail into the bleachers. 
 The Chicagoan described its subject in an issue from 1927: ''It's a crescent-shaped town, 26 miles by 15, along a great lake that's begun to weaken and recede. No wonder. An unchallenged murder record -- a splendid university -- hobo capital to the country -- railroad ruler, corn baron, liquor king -- and the finest of grand opera. Altogether the most zestful spectacle on this sphere.'' 
 Zestful was right. During its brief life span the magazine epitomized the Chicago sound, the sardonic snap of Preston Sturges or Ben Hecht that was equal parts street tough and nightclub habitue. The New Yorker may have been the immediate inspiration, but The Chicagoan tended more toward the clever, white-gloved sophistication of Vanity Fair and The Smart Set. (The Smart Set, incidentally, wins the prize for Best Magazine Slogan Ever: ''One civilized reader is worth a thousand boneheads.'') In the pages of The Chicagoan restaurants were categorized as Downtown, Out a Ways or 'Way Out; a play could be touted as ''worth eyeing and earing''; a reader's complaint about the magazine's spelling mistakes could be met with a cocked eyebrow and wrinkled nose: ''Oh, Well . . . Anybody can spell.'' Take that, vaunted New Yorker fact-checking department! 
 Well. . . . The Chicagoan was full of mistakes, and it never achieved The New Yorker's literary renown; few of the writers and artists it published are remembered today. But thumbing through the magazine's pages -- as represented here by the complete issue of July 2, 1927; editorials, reviews, profiles, articles and cartoons from others; more than 80 pages of the magazine's astonishing covers; and a sampling of its advertisements for pipes, gowns, Victrolas, sack suits, deodorant -- is a bit like having William Powell and Myrna Loy sweep through your living room. 
 The magazine may have been light and fizzy, but it could be firm and forthright in its convictions: it ballyhooed Rachmaninoff and Walt Disney, pilloried Prohibition and the mania over Charles Lindbergh. A 1929 editorial ridiculed the fact that a statue erected in Grant Park to honor American Indians had given them horses of a sort that never roamed ''over the plains that are now Illinois, or anywhere else on this continent.'' And throughout its run the magazine took it upon itself to defend Chicago from those who claimed it was overrun by crime, it stank, its government was corrupt, its streets were wind-beaten. So went the litany at the time. ''Chicago,'' declared one editorial, ''happens to be, by common consent of the writing gentry, the Gomorrah of the moment.'' The magazine thundered against such calumny, defending the city's ''gusto and glamour'' in issue after issue. 
 For all this, it's not clear why the magazine failed so dramatically. Perhaps its editors never got the balance right between their passion for what Carl Sandburg had hailed as the city's ''coarse and strong and cunning'' soul and their obsession with its increasing glitz and refinement. While The New Yorker and other magazines tackled the Great Depression head on, The Chicagoan more or less ignored it. An editorial in December 1930 declared: ''We would be the last to take serious thought of the unemployment. . . . Our talent, if any, is for lighter, gayer tasks.'' The magazine's talent was out of business before employment rebounded a few years later. 
 Chicago has bred a remarkable number of notable magazines: Poetry and The Little Review in the early part of the 20th century, Esquire and Playboy in the middle, The Baffler and Stop Smiling at its end. Thanks to Neil Harris's serendipitous discovery and the University of Chicago Press's superb effort, The Chicagoan takes its rightful place on the top shelf.

HEADLINE: Rugby Team Teaches More Than Sport

 BODY:
To the Sports Editor:
 Re ''The Unlikely Scrum,'' Nov. 15: District of Columbia residents can be proud of Hyde Leadership Public Charter School's establishment of what is believed to be the nation's first all-African-American high school rugby team. This imported sport teaches lessons for life to children from some of the District's most vulnerable communities. 
 Public charter schools like Hyde educate more than one in three of the District's students. Nonselective, publicly financed and independently run, these schools foster partnership among parents, teachers and students. These schools' independence creates an environment in which parents can be more involved, teachers are free to innovate and students are provided the structure they need to learn.
 Economically disadvantaged students in public charter secondary schools are twice as likely to score advanced or proficient on math and reading tests as students in traditional D.C. public schools.

HEADLINE: Connecticut Towns See the Effect on the Community

BYLINE: By CYNTHIA WOLFE BOYNTON

 BODY:
SEVERAL years of headlines and impassioned protests over older homes being torn down and replaced with larger ones -- referred to locally as Fairfield County McMansions -- have made the term ''teardown'' synonymous with controversy. 
 However, losses associated with many of the 7,746 Connecticut homes demolished by builders last year have more to do with sentiment than historic or architectural significance, said First Selectman Gordon Joseloff of Westport.
 ''When most homes get knocked down, people get emotional because they remember the family that lived there for 30 years, or because when they were growing up, they went to that house every day after school for milk and cookies,'' said Mr. Joseloff who, as former editor and now publisher of the news site westportnow.com, has digitally documented Westport teardowns since 2005. ''People get riled up when a historic house is being torn down. But what I hope people realize is that every teardown has an impact on the look and feel of a community.''
 With 95 Westport homes demolished in 2007, according to the most recent statistics available from the state Department of Economic and Community Development, the city ranks second in state teardowns.
 Greenwich leads with 214 in the 2007-8 fiscal year, said Greenwich Building Official William Marr. Rounding out the top five are New Haven with 90 in the 2007 calendar year, New Britain with 63 and Fairfield with 60.
 Based on Greenwich demolition applications submitted since July 1, Mr. Marr projects 35 percent fewer residential teardowns will happen in his city this year. Ken DelVecchio, the president of the Connecticut Association of Realtors, expects similar drops will be experienced statewide.
 ''The economy's stagnant -- money's tight for buying and building,'' Mr. DelVecchio said. ''Realtors and builders need to focus on selling the inventory they have, rather than think about creating something new.'' He said that new housing permits overall are down at least 50 percent compared to this time last year. 
 Helen Higgins, executive director of the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, would like to believe this downturn means she and other preservationists can breathe at least a temporary sigh of relief: Fewer teardowns mean fewer historic homes to worry about saving.
 But when money is not available for demolishing and building, it is also usually not there for needed upkeep and renovations.
 ''Neglect of older homes can also lead to destruction,'' she added.
 She said she was encouraged by towns like Cheshire, where Historic District Commission members are considering an ordinance that would delay up to 180 days efforts to demolish any building 75 years old or older. Similar ordinances have been passed in recent years in Hartford, Essex, New Canaan and other communities.
 ''If nothing else, a delay allows for dialogue and at least the possibility of compromise,'' Ms. Higgins said. ''When too many teardowns occur, you tear down a community's sense of character.''

HEADLINE: As Thanksgiving Goes, So Goes the Nation

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI

 BODY:
A few renegades like to eat at restaurants for Thanksgiving, but for most people it is the ultimate eat-at-someone's-home day. The NPD Group, a market research firm, says that ''typically two households are the guest of another household'' on Thanksgiving, and that there are an average of nine people at each table. 
 In general, more people are eating at home -- their own home -- throughout the year, NPD data show. For the 12 months ended in February, 242 at-home supper meals were prepared and consumed per person, compared with 231 in the period five years earlier, NPD says. This trend seems likely to accelerate as the economy worsens. 
 But the reasons for at-home eating are not entirely financial, said Harry Balzer, NPD vice president and chief industry analyst. Another factor is that meal preparation is becoming less gender-specific and therefore less of an individual burden. In fact, ''men are preparing more dinner on a nightly basis than ever in the history of this country,'' he said.

HEADLINE: The Defense We Need, and Can Afford

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''A Military for a Dangerous New World'' (editorial, Nov. 16), you call attention to the fact that the Pentagon's total budget in 2008, including spending on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is ''nearly equal to all of the rest of the world's defense budgets combined.'' 
 Excessive defense budgets have been the case for many years, predating our entry into those two wars. Nearly five decades ago President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned of the danger of an unchecked military-industrial complex, a warning that has been more honored in the breach than the observance.
 During our current financial emergency, when the federal deficit is certain to reach unprecedented levels, we can no longer afford to spend many billions of dollars on new generations of weapons systems whose only real-world military match is our own currently deployed weapons systems. 
 I hope that after Barack Obama is sworn in as president, he will propose budgets that reflect the fact that spending on green technologies or upgrading infrastructure would be far more constructive than financing yet another weapons program and its cost overrun. 
 Russ Weiss Princeton, N.J., Nov. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 While you denounce ''ill-founded wars of choice like the one in Iraq,'' you present a plan for a military structured to fight future Iraq-like wars. 
 You propose a goal of ''a military that is large enough and mobile enough to deter enemies,'' but such a military would not deter the socioeconomic instability and weak governance that feed radical ideologies and often lead to violent insurgencies and civil conflict. 
 I agree that we need the military you describe to win the wars we are in now -- wars that are very likely to continue for several more years, notwithstanding the change in administrations. But the idea that America should shape its military to be involved in endless stability and reconstruction-like operations in the future is unsustainable. 
 Our new leadership should consider a force focused on superiority in the global commons -- air, sea, space and cyberspace -- whose focus would be containing emerging instability and other threats. 
 Our best strategy against insurgencies and failed states is to help prevent them from happening in the first place, and that will take an increase in investment in our nonmilitary instruments of national power, such as covert operations capabilities and the State Department's capacity to carry out foreign aid programs.
 Chris Robinson Washington, Nov. 17, 2008
 The writer, a commander in the United States Navy, is a senior military fellow at the National Defense University.
 To the Editor:
 A nation with a debt load of more than $10 trillion, with annual interest charges climbing toward $500 billion, has diminished options when it comes to fixing our broken military.
 Private companies with lucrative contracts that use civilians as the military cooks, drivers, housekeepers and security guards -- once the normal duties of low-cost military personnel -- cannot be financially sustained. If we increase the number of ground troops, does that mean we have to hire more people to clean their rooms?
 A fundamental change for retooling our military that should be mentioned is the resumption of national military service. It would take courage by the president-elect, and Congress as well, but mandating national service for homeland security and military duties might be our last best option for righting the terrible wrongs that have been done to our military.
 Tom Gailes Canaan, Conn., Nov. 16, 2008
 The writer is a retired Navy lieutenant.
 To the Editor:
 A bigger Army, by all means. But it won't be a better Army until our nation embraces the notion of honor in service. 
 No doubt a falling economy helps recruiting, but enlistments based on desperation don't generate the commitment or pride the country needs now in faraway places.
 Charles A. Krohn Burke, Va., Nov. 16, 2008
 The writer, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, is the author of a book about the Tet offensive in Vietnam in 1968.
 To the Editor:
 One way to move forward on your sensible recommendations would be for the Pentagon to ask Congress to repeal the ''don't ask, don't tell'' law and replace it with open military service without regard to sexual orientation. Our military would be stronger today if more than 12,000 service members had not been discharged under the law. 
 The new defense secretary and the Joint Chiefs of Staff must eventually acknowledge what many major corporations, city and county fire and police departments around the country, and 24 of our international military allies already know and practice: Sexual orientation bears no relationship to job performance. 
 Basic fairness and integrity aside, common sense and the urgent need for qualified military personnel should dictate that the Pentagon do the right thing and urge Congress to end this discriminatory law.
 Aubrey Sarvis Executive Director, Servicemembers Legal Defense Network Washington, Nov. 17, 2008
 To the Editor:
 You recommend a military strategy that is based on the last war. A larger Army and Marine Corps will be needed only if the United States intends to get bogged down in the future in lengthy conventional ground conflicts abroad. 
 The terrorist threat from the Middle East and South Asia will not be defeated by conventional military ground conflict or American counterinsurgency strategies. It will require a more comprehensive political and economic strategy. 
 Counterinsurgency wars are ultimately won or lost by indigenous forces. The United States needs an offshore military strategy, with the capability to project power when needed in support of its own interests or of indigenous allied forces. 
 America must be capable not just of firing long-range missiles or delivering ordnance accurately from manned and unmanned vehicles, but also of inserting and recovering special forces at significant ranges. It requires a much greater investment in intelligence capabilities. 
 America must recognize that it is 2008, not 1948. Regional states are capable of addressing regional threats in Europe and Asia, with the United States in a supporting role. America does not need just a new military strategy. It needs a new national strategy that brings America's role in the world and the ends it seeks into balance with the means available and the will of the American people.
 William T. Pendley Bluffton, S.C., Nov. 19, 2008
 The writer was a deputy assistant secretary of defense, 1992-93.
 To the Editor:
 I was born in 1920 in the immediate aftermath of World War I, and as a child I saw what that war did to my uncles (shell shock and alcoholism).
 I was in the Women's Army Corps in World War II, on a hospital ship, and saw thousands of those ruined lives. 
 With the Bush wars, I have seen the worst human suffering of all on television. 
 Your editorial is laying out big plans to fight future wars. Do you want to tell me why the people of France, Britain, Germany and other countries, who are walking around on battlegrounds, who understand war, don't build up to such extent for more wars? It's easy. They know better.

HEADLINE: Her Life as a Mom, an Actress and a Boy

BYLINE: By JOE RHODES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 PAMELA ADLON had a little talk with her 11-year-old older daughter a few weeks ago, just in case she or any of her middle school classmates accidentally encounter Mommy's latest work, which happens to involve the simulated ingestion of many illegal drugs, assorted sexual acts and a number of obscenely specific suggestions about where some of the other grown-ups should place certain body parts.
 ''I just want you to know a couple of things,'' Ms. Adlon recalled saying to her daughter, preparing her for the possible ramifications of her mother's increasingly prominent role in the second season of the very adult Showtime series ''Californication.'' ''It's not appropriate for kids to be watching this. It's a show for grown-ups.
 ''I'm extremely proud of the show I'm doing and the work I'm doing, and it doesn't say anything bad or wrong or anything I'm ashamed of. If somebody says something to you or tries to make you feel embarrassed or says that I should be embarrassed, I'm not. And you shouldn't be either, O.K.?'' 
 It gets tricky sometimes for Ms. Adlon, navigating between her work world and her suburban-mom world, not just because she's an actor -- there are plenty of those sprinkled among the sideline-cheering soccer parents of Sherman Oaks -- but also because her most prominent roles are so different from her actual life. 
 She is the Emmy-winning voice of the pudgy preadolescent Bobby Hill on the Fox animated series ''King of the Hill'' and also voices dozens of other animated characters in movies and television. And then there's ''Californication,'' with its graphic language and often-twisted situations. At one point in the second season David Duchovny, the show's star, refers to the diminutive Ms. Adlon's character, Marcy Runkle, as ''Coke Smurf.''
 ''It's like this little secret that I keep with me throughout the day,'' she said, sitting down in a coffee shop in the anonymous Encino office building where she had just finished a ''King of the Hill'' script reading. ''I'm with the moms at school, and I'm like, 'You would never believe what I did today.' I'd go do the 'King of the Hill' table read, then I'd go to 'Californication,' do some weird sex scene or drug thing, and then go pick up my kids from school. It's bizarre.''
 Ms. Adlon has had a double life for much of her acting career, which started 30 years ago, when she was 12. Because of her husky voice and tomboy demeanor, Pamela Segall (that was her maiden name before she married Felix Adlon, a writer and producer, in 1996) found herself playing lots of tough kids and street urchins and, more than a few times, parts that were written for boys.
 ''My roles in the '80s were, like, gender dysphoric,'' she said. ''I wasn't pretty, I wasn't this, I wasn't that. And I am kind of butchy, you know. That's just my thing. When I did 'The Redd Foxx Show,' I went all the way through the audition as 'Paul Segall.' The casting people were in on it. At the end of the audition I opened my shirt, and I had an Ace bandage wrapped around my chest.
 ''That was my whole career: the big reveal. I did 'Night Court,' the one where Bull'' -- Richard Moll's bailiff character -- ''adopts me, and the audience is shocked at the end that I'm a girl,'' she said, referring to a 1984 episode of that sitcom. ''It was weird. And it's so funny to me now, because it ends up that my most famous role is still me playing a little boy.''
 She's been playing that little boy, Bobby Hill, for 12 years now. (Fox has canceled the show, but ABC has expressed interest in picking it up.) Auditioning cold, she somehow came up, on the spot, with the twangy, naive and often exhausted-sounding voice that she calls ''the holy grail'' and ''the best character I've ever played'' It's a signature part that has brought her name recognition and steady paychecks.
 John Altschuler, a co-executive producer of ''King of the Hill,'' praised her portrayal. ''Pamela has so much inner life that it comes pouring out of Bobby,'' he said. ''He doesn't come across as a loser, because she feels that Bobby is a great kid.''
 Ms. Adlon said voice-overs saved her career. Successful as her child-actress years had been, she struggled to find parts in her 20s. 
 ''I went from buying my own condominium and a car for myself when I was 17 on 'The Facts of Life' to not being able to pay my rent,'' she recalled. ''I was at the unemployment office all the time. I had to sell my record collection just to make ends meet. And then I started getting these voice-over jobs.'' 
 Besides ''King of the Hill'' she has had regular voice roles on a host of animated shows, including ''Squirrel Boy,'' ''The Oblongs'' and ''Jakers! The Adventures of Piggley Winks'' (as Hector MacBadger). Only in the last few years has she aggressively pursued on-camera parts again. 
 Her breakthrough came in 2006 when she was cast opposite the comedian Louis C. K. in the verbally graphic HBO series ''Lucky Louie.'' Broadcast live in front of a studio audience and canceled after one controversial season, it gave her a chance to play a working-class wife with a sharp tongue and a real sex life, precursors to her role on ''Californication.''
 ''Before 'Lucky Louie' nobody would ever cast me to play a mom or a wife, nobody ever saw me in that role, which is weird since that's who I really am,'' she said. ''And then Louis called and said, 'You have to be my Edith Bunker.' '' 
 Tom Kapinos, the creator of ''Californication,'' saw Ms. Adlon on ''Lucky Louie'' and also remembered her from a small part in an otherwise forgettable 1996 feature film, ''Bed of Roses.'' He pursued her, first with the idea that she would play the show's female lead and then, after that role was taken by Natasha McElhone, writing the part of Marcy Runkle just for her. 
 ''She really has ended up being the show's secret weapon,'' Mr. Kapinos said. ''I feel like I can write anything for her, and she'll knock it out of the park. There's always a special joy when you write some filthy speech for her and know she's going to turn it into magic. It's like gutter poetry.''
 In Ms. Adlon's ''Californication'' scenes, she has snorted copious amounts of cocaine (actually powdered milk and sugar), her makeup has been smeared from sweat and exertion, and she has been photographed from some less than flattering bedroom angles. ''I think about the repercussions sometimes, but I like to be extreme,'' she said. ''If people have a strong reaction, I like that.''
 In addition to raising her two daughters, acting and doing voice-overs, Ms. Adlon would like to start her own production company. She is already working on a pilot with Louis C. K. for CBS. ''We want to make it a social comedy,'' she said, ''about the middle class that is hanging on to the toilet seat, about to go down the drain.'' 
 She said she wanted to do ''as many different things as possible,'' adding, ''I get some of that from my dad'' -- Don Segall, who wrote comic books, television shows and science fiction pulp novels, and who died in 1994. ''He said you've got to try something new every day,'' she said. ''Irons in the fire, that was his thing. You got to have a lot of irons in the fire.''

HEADLINE: How to Leave Iraq -- Intact

BYLINE: By PETER MANSOOR. 
Peter Mansoor is a professor of military history at Ohio State University and the author of ''Baghdad at Sunrise: A Brigade Commander's War in Iraq.'' From February 2007 to May 2008, he was the executive officer to Gen. David Petraeus, the top American commander in Iraq.

DATELINE: Columbus, Ohio 

 BODY:
 AS a brigade commander in Baghdad in 2003, I befriended a resident, Adnan Abdul Sahib, who went on to serve two terms as the head of the city advisory council. In 2007, however, sectarian violence forced his family from their home in central Baghdad, and they fled the country. Last month I talked with Adnan in Colorado, where he and his family are now refugees. ''The fatal mistake the United States made in Iraq,'' he told me, ''was to empower extreme sectarian political parties. It's time to give the moderates a voice.''
 Barack Obama has the opportunity to recast American policy toward Iraq in a meaningful way, by providing much-needed support to its political center. His administration should view the new status of forces agreement between Washington and Baghdad as a means to shape the withdrawal of our combat forces while maintaining enough leverage to guide Iraq toward a more stable future. 
 The assumption behind the recently concluded military surge was that substantial reductions in ethnic and sectarian violence would lead to progress on political reconciliation. The security situation has improved remarkably, and while political compromise has not followed as swiftly as we hoped, there has been some progress, especially in terms of clarifying the roles and powers of each of the country's 18 provinces and paving the way for provincial elections early next year. 
 The key now is to sustain the momentum toward reconciliation, even while combat forces are withdrawn -- a delicate balancing act. Although insurgent attacks have been appreciably reduced and Al Qaeda in Iraq is devastated, considerable distrust remains among various ethnic factions and religious sects and within the Iraqi government. As honest brokers, American forces keep the peace in key areas. Yet it is possible that we can complete their departure over three years, as envisioned in the status of forces agreement, assuming that the Iraqi Army has matured enough to take on added responsibilities.
 Up to four brigades and their associated support -- 20,000 to 25,000 troops -- could be withdrawn in 2009, which would provide reinforcements for the war in Afghanistan. Withdrawals should then accelerate, as the division of power and resources is cemented locally across Iraq, with half the remaining combat forces and their associated support withdrawn in each of the following two years. By the end of 2011 -- subject to Iraqi concurrence, of course -- some 20,000 to 40,000 troops would remain for an extended period. These would be mainly military advisers, counterterrorist units, combat aircraft crews and support, and intelligence and logistical personnel.
 Much of the stability in Iraq stems from a patchwork of agreements across the country between local leaders and the American military or the Iraqi government. To make sure that these agreements endure, the Iraqi government needs to prove to its people that it represents their interests in these ways: by ensuring adequate representation in political life of all sects and ethnicities in the political life; by incorporating a significant number of the Sons of Iraq (Sunnis who have supported the counterinsurgency) into the police forces and other government jobs; by providing tangible incentives for the return of Iraqi refugees from abroad; and by equitably distributing government funds and services to all areas of Iraq. 
 In this light, the provincial and national elections next year are crucial to the way ahead. That Sunni Arabs and several nonsectarian parties have decided to take part promises a more broadly representative and legitimate government. It is in the interest of both Iraq and the United States to see these elections held in a free, fair and transparent manner. 
 Even as we pull troops out, the United States is not without significant leverage. We provide the Iraqi armed forces needed assets, from intelligence and logistics to air support and advisers; our civilian advisers are helping to improve the efficiency of the Iraqi government; our global diplomatic leverage can help Iraq in a number of ways; and Washington can encourage business investment in Iraq, particularly in its dilapidated oil industry.
 To nudge the Iraqi government in the right direction, the new administration must let it know, quietly but firmly, that the blank check given by the Bush administration is no longer in force. It should make clear that we, too, want to see the expeditious withdrawal of American combat forces, but only in a manner that ensures Iraq will not again dissolve into chaos and civil war. Long-term American diplomatic, economic and military support should be contingent on a comprehensive political solution with a fair division of power. The alternative -- a sectarian Shiite government that marginalizes other sects and ethnicities and is perhaps aligned with Iran as well -- is unacceptable.

HEADLINE: Lawyers Wanted: Abroad, That Is

BYLINE: By JOHN BRINGARDNER

 BODY:
SARAH N. GLENN, a fourth-year associate at the venerable law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy, is moving to Japan in January.
Although she is 5-foot-10 and has shoulder-length red hair, she blends in with the crowd when she walks to work in Lower Manhattan, not far from Wall Street. She anticipates that some adjustments will be in order when she starts working in her firm's Tokyo office.
''There are 10 lawyers there now and they're all men,'' she says.
Ms. Glenn, 31, has never been to Japan, but when Milbank approached her this summer about a one-year stint there, she took only a week to think about it and say yes. 
''Because of the markets, since October things have started to slow down in New York, while it seems that things are still busy in Asia,'' she says. ''But it's hard to know even what to expect. No matter what people describe, it's hard to plan what your experience is going to be like.''
Major American law firms have long had a presence abroad, staffed by a combination of local counsel and lawyers from the home office. But as the economic downturn continues to cause upheaval in corporate America and the law firms that serve it, many firms are relying on their international outposts to keep profits up -- and a growing number of lawyers are starting to look overseas for work. Not long ago, the City of London was New York's primary competitor for financial talent, and Britain was often one of the first choices for lawyers deciding to head abroad.
But with Wall Street in tatters and London struggling as the credit crisis plays out, lawyers and analysts say that the most promising places for legal careers are such far-flung locales as Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Hong Kong. Even though Dubai's booming economy has cooled sharply recently, lawyers say demand for their services remains strong there, and other overseas markets are still beckoning lawyers despite the global impact of the credit crisis -- at least for now.
When work was plentiful at home, it was often a tough sell to get lawyers to move halfway around the world. But since the financial unraveling in September, that's all changed. In the last two months, recruiters in Hong Kong and Dubai say they've seen a record number of New York resumes from candidates looking for law-firm or in-house legal work overseas.
Over the past decade, major corporate law firms have made international expansion a top priority, and some have become truly global businesses.
In the past decade, top firms like Jones Day, based in Cleveland, went from 6 foreign offices to 18. Weil, Gotshal & Manges, based in New York, went from 3 to 9, and Latham & Watkins, based in Los Angeles, from 5 to 14.
Much overseas expansion has occurred in the past five years, and even more recently than that for the Middle East and Asia, according to statistics compiled by the National Law Journal, a trade publication. In Hong Kong, there was a 48 percent increase in the number of lawyers from the 250 biggest American law firms from 2007 to 2008, based on data from the journal. In Abu Dhabi, their ranks grew 144 percent.
In February, Latham & Watkins announced three new offices in the Middle East -- in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Doha, Qatar -- in one fell swoop, to reach its total of 14.
Dewey & LeBoeuf, based in New York, closed offices in Connecticut, Florida, North Carolina and Texas this year. But in the same October memo the firm sent to its eight Charlotte lawyers and staff members to inform them of the closing there, the firm's executive director announced the opening of new outposts in Doha and Abu Dhabi early next year.
And the beat goes on.
''I know of at least 10 or 11 associates who are throwing their resumes out here, or coming by to visit to check it out,'' says Arjun Ahluwalia, an associate in the Dubai office of the London-based Allen & Overy, who moved there from Shearman & Sterling in New York.
Mr. Ahluwalia, 30, grew up in Dubai, went to law school in Michigan and began his career in New York. Now, he says, he sees a big push from young lawyers hoping to find work in the Middle East. ''Even kids currently in law school are coming by Dubai for jobs,'' he says. ''I met a very enthusiastic candidate from a Chicago law school in his second year who basically flew to Dubai for four days and actually cold-called and made visits to a bunch of firms.''
BRUCE MacEWEN, a lawyer in New York who also consults with law firms on strategic issues, says firms ''have realized that based on demographics and petrodollars, there's going to be growth in Asia and the Middle East that wasn't in their plans 5 to 10 years ago.'' But staffing the new offices with qualified lawyers to handle growing demand hasn't always been easy.
The talent pool isn't large enough in Hong Kong or Dubai to absorb the work, so firms often find themselves soliciting lawyers from their offices in the United States or Britain, enticing lateral hires from other firms or promising younger lawyers a chance to do high-level client work much sooner than they might in New York.
Some firms are shifting partners and associates to overseas offices to build their local practices abroad while work dries up at home.
Kirkland & Ellis, a Chicago-based firm known as a litigation powerhouse, has six offices in the United States and three overseas. The firm opened its Hong Kong office in 2006, and in October began adding to its practice there to meet increased demand from private equity funds in Asia, just as the market for private equity worked bottomed out in the United States.
James P. Duffy IV, a fifth-year associate at DLA Piper, moved to Dubai in June for what was meant to be six months at the firm's office there. It didn't take long for the partners in Dubai to ask if he could extend his stay.
Mr. Duffy is doing regulatory and corporate governance work, helping to draft an anti-corruption law for the government of Qatar and performing securities work for an investment bank.
DLA, which was formed in 2005 when two American firms merged with a major British firm, opened its Dubai office two and a half years ago and already has about 120 lawyers practicing there, nearly all of them expatriates.
Although expat lawyers pay no local taxes in Dubai, Americans are still subject to income tax at home. The I.R.S. allows for a foreign earned income exclusion, which means American citizens working abroad who meet certain conditions can get their first $87,600 tax-free. For most workers, this might be a windfall, but for some lawyers making upward of $300,000, it once wasn't enough incentive to move to Dubai.
Times have changed.
''I've got friends that are coming over in January to start looking around,'' Mr. Duffy says. ''I think maybe they thought it's time to start looking elsewhere. There's still just a lot of opportunity in Dubai, particularly if you're somebody who's adventuresome or entrepreneurial.''
In fact, Dubai has become so desirable that there is now a slight backlog of job applicants. Mark Anderson, a legal recruiter there, said that in the last month or so, he has been receiving a lot of resumes ''from good-quality New York lawyers.''
''But to be completely honest,'' he said, ''we're really struggling to get these guys jobs over here.''
AS applications pour into places like Dubai, American firms are stoking the attraction of overseas work by downsizing at home.
Law firms in the United States are culling associates and shrinking summer associate programs amid a decline in work, particularly in areas like real estate, securities and capital markets.
To be sure, domestic firms are making opportunistic hires from major firms that have collapsed, like Thelen L.L.P. and Heller Ehrman L.L.P. Otherwise, say recruiters, most lateral hires in the United States involve bankruptcy or litigation practices, two areas getting a boost from the economic downturn.
As Dubai inches closer to a critical mass of lawyers, firms are expanding elsewhere in the area to get ahead of the rush. When more firms opened in Dubai, early entrants like Clifford Chance, Patton Boggs and Vinson & Elkins turned to Abu Dhabi, 90 miles away.
Most of the business in Abu Dhabi revolves around legal advice proffered to government businesses funded by its huge sovereign wealth fund. Similarly, Qatar has emerged as the next new destination, with Latham & Watkins, DLA Piper and Covington & Burling all opening outposts in Doha this year.
Selling lawyers on work in these offices has become significantly easier in recent months, not only because of the downturn, but also because of the higher profile these destinations have enjoyed in the news media.
Dubai's luxury hotels, bold architecture and relatively open society helped expose the emirate to a broad American audience, making the prospect of living in the Mideast -- at least this part of it -- seem an exotic adventure.
''People are interested in the fact I was over there,'' says Shani S. Smith, a senior associate at Fulbright & Jaworski, who recently returned to New York after six months in Dubai; the firm is based in Houston.
Ms. Smith, 31, says cocktail-party conversation divides equally between questions about her work, what it was like to be a Western woman in the Mideast, and the size of Dubai's shopping malls.
John V. Lonsberg, who brought his Middle East legal team from Bryan Cave to Fulbright & Jaworski three years ago, started working in Saudi Arabia in 1979 and can remember two other cycles of major law firm investment in the region.
In the late 1970s and early '80s, major American firms opened in Saudi Arabia while top British firms opened offices in the gulf states. Once recession hit in the late 1980s, many firms pulled out; Bryan Cave kept its office in Saudi Arabia but shuttered its office in Dubai.
In the early 1990s, firms started to venture back to the region as the economy began to pick up again. Bryan Cave reopened its Dubai outpost in 1993. But Mr. Lonsberg says the growth of the legal market today is unlike anything he has seen before.
Mark E. Bisch, a Fulbright partner who heads its Dubai office, speculates that nearly 40 American and British firms have opened branches in the region this year alone.
With a big client base in the military, infrastructure and transportation industries -- including much of the work for American military contractors operating in Iraq -- Fulbright has a much deeper connection to the region than many firms now entering it.
''We always see a lot of resumes -- three to five a day,'' Mr. Lonsberg says.
Chris Pisacane, 32, is in the second year of a clerkship with a Supreme Court judge in New York County. He spent three years in the financial services industry before deciding to go to law school, where he spent a summer working as an associate with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
His clerkship and financial background give him the kind of resume that goes far when applying to top New York law firms, and that's what he was planning to do until September, when Wall Street went into a tailspin.
''I was looking for work in New York,'' he says, ''but because things are tighter over here for the time being, it makes sense for me at this point to look overseas as well.''
Mr. Pisacane talked to a friend working for a firm in Dubai who encouraged him to visit for a week to meet with some of his contacts, and to see the place for himself before thinking about relocating. He plans to make the 14-hour flight in January.
''Part of going over there is to visit him and see how he lives on a daily basis, to get a sense of that,'' Mr. Pisacane says. ''He said it would be good to come over for a week or 10 days -- there's also the personal aspect to consider. Could you live here and see yourself doing the work? That's just as important as getting a job.''
The economic downturn has also put other postings on applicants' radar -- like Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Only a handful of American firms, like Fulbright and King & Spalding, have offices there. They typically ally with local counsel, handling matters of Islamic finance -- structuring investments to comply with Islamic law -- as well as energy and real estate issues.
''Three years ago I could never sell a lawyer to go to Riyadh, ever,'' says Louise Wall, a legal recruiter based in Dubai. ''But I've sent three in the last three months.''
FOR some lawyers, looking abroad for work is also a chance to evolve personally as well as professionally -- as long as they have the requisite skills to stand out in increasingly competitive markets.
''I have people in Hong Kong who had never even visited until I sent them there,'' says Evan P. Jowers, a legal recruiter at Kinney Recruiting who is based in New York and Hong Kong. ''This year it really has to be the most impressive candidate on paper for firms to look at them.''
A year ago, a lawyer looking for work in Hong Kong could have gone on eight interviews and had seven offers, Mr. Jowers says. But in this market, firms can afford to be choosier.
''In 2006, firms in Hong Kong were panic-hiring because they knew that if they didn't hire a guy, the next firm would,'' he says. ''Now they can afford to be more selective because there are more highly qualified candidates coming over.''
David P. Eich, a partner with Kirkland & Ellis in Hong Kong, says the talent market overseas, especially in Asia and the Middle East, has begun to even out with that of the United States as the crisis has forced lawyers to look abroad.
When Kirkland opened its Hong Kong office in 2006, Mr. Eich says, it was hard to complete its hiring locally. American and British firms there were willing to make candidates the kind of fantastic offers they'd rarely see at home. ''Two years ago I saw third-years asking to be made partners,'' Mr. Eich says. ''With the market crash we immediately felt the inflection of that. These days I see partners happy to take a salary adjustment for their circumstances.''
Associates at major firms who move to Hong Kong are still typically paid what they would make in New York, and a housing allowance. But with more qualified applicants, that may change.
Mr. Eich sees the economic crisis as a chance to build Kirkland's team in Hong Kong. ''Our view is that the cycle will rectify itself, and we'll come out in the next eight months or so, and this is an opportunity to acquire top-notch people whose platforms don't serve them at the moment,'' he adds.
Until the crisis passes -- which for now appears quite a way off -- Mr. Eich is convinced that the bear market has helped to make a job offer in Hong Kong that much more enticing for lawyers in New York or London.
''They're looking at 24 months of downtime,'' he says. ''If you're a recruiter and before you were trying to drag a guy out here, now you can go to New York and London and say: 'Hey, you're 38 and there's a major market downturn where you are. You can either sit it out at home or come here and build a practice.' ''

HEADLINE: Multiscreen Mad Men

BYLINE: Moderated by JACK HITT. 
Jack Hitt is a contributing writer.Benjamin Palmer is the C.E.O. of the Barbarian Group, an Internet advertising and marketing firm based in Boston. He helped create the ''Subservient Chicken'' online campaign for Burger King. Lars Bastholm is a chief creative officer at AKQA, where he has worked on campaigns for Xbox, Coca-Cola and Motorola. Robert Rasmussen is the executive creative director of the Nike account at R/GA, an agency that specializes in digital media. He has created campaigns for ESPN, Sega and JetBlue.

 BODY:
I. THE END OF FLOW
 Jack Hitt: I read a study recently suggesting that Americans now swim through most of their day looking at some kind of screen -- screens on their cellphones, on their desks, in their kitchens, everything from digital billboards on the highway and in the back of a cab to the eruption of screens in urban centers. Times Square is no longer an unusual attraction; it's the norm. The side of a building can now be made to broadcast video. There is hardly a public space left -- a bar, a gym, the dentist's office -- that hasn't been vanquished by some kind of screen. Now, let's say I've got something to sell. This multiplicity of screens would seem to be a good thing, wouldn't it?
 Benjamin Palmer: What the proliferation of screens has done is give a bazillion creators the power to publish. There are now billions of hours of content, which means new places for advertisers to latch on to -- lots of content that pockets of people find interesting. But the shift you're describing makes things more complicated for advertisers too. When the TV networks held the reins for content, all advertising had to do was buy into the public consciousness of entertainment, which was television. 
 Lars Bastholm: It used to be really easy for us to advertise anything because consumers had no idea what they were buying. We could basically sell them whatever we wanted. But the Internet has made everything so transparent.
 Robert Rasmussen: A brand could tell people what was cool because there was less freedom of choice in media. A brand could say, ''This is the latest thing, and everybody's doing it,'' and if the message was persuasive enough, you might believe it. Now you can check on that on the Internet and see whether everybody actually is doing it. Brands have become transparent, and that's changed the tone of advertising. Now you have to try to be more authentic -- even if it's just authentically acknowledging that what you're doing is advertising. 
 Bastholm: Most media, like television, used to be a kind of flow. You'd sit down, you'd turn it on and you'd watch. The reason advertising is completely broken is that the flow doesn't exist anymore. There's no prime time. There's no such thing as must-see TV. Everyone's composing their own flow. And once you start becoming the composer of your own flow, you can't go back. You're like, Why would I have somebody dictate to me what I watch when I'm used to programming for myself? 
 Rasmussen: So advertising is by necessity a fractured narrative. We have a story we want to tell, and we use different media channels and different touch points to tell it. We have to rely on the consumer to pull the story together.
 Palmer: Marketing has actually always been very comfortable with the notion that a brand story can exist in multiple forms. Even before the Internet, advertising had to come up with a point of view that would work well in a magazine, on a sign, along the side of a bus or on TV, all at the same time. We needed to be able to tell a story that could exist in fragments, and no matter which fragments people saw and in what order they assembled them together in their head, it still added up to the same message. Now that's happening with content, too. People are consuming all their information and their stories from multiple sources and putting the pieces together on their own, and sometimes the content is not written to hold up to that kind of fragmenting and reassembling. But advertising has actually always been made to hold up to that. So the way people put together marketing is actually the way everybody is absorbing new forms of media now.
 Hitt: So you're saying that even 10 years ago, advertising was delivering piecemeal narrative.
 Rasmussen: You just didn't realize it. Remember ''Star Wars''? The bigger narrative was about the way people involved ''Star Wars'' in their lives: the T-shirts, all the talk about it, the fan fiction, the nicknames, the dialogue people quoted. People were willing to brand themselves with all these other elements that were outside the movie experience. 
 Bastholm: In those days, though, there was usually more of a brand monologue. Your brand would just spout whatever values you were trying to instill in your consumers. If it worked, great. People would talk about it around the water cooler.
 Hitt: And that doesn't work anymore?
 Bastholm: Right. That process became too transparent. Now our job is to have a conversation with your consumers about whatever story it is you want to tell about the brand.
 Hitt: Which companies do you think are having that dialogue successfully?
 Bastholm: EA Sports, the video-game company, is a good example. On YouTube, someone posted a clip of himself playing the company's Tiger Woods golf game. He put it up as a joke, laughing at EA Sports, because he had discovered a glitch in the programming that allowed Tiger to walk right out onto a pond next to the golf course and shoot his ball from there. So the company saw the video, and in response, it uploaded this ad to YouTube that said: ''It's not a glitch. He's just that good.'' The ad showed the real Tiger, in live action, actually walk on water and shoot a ball. That's a great example of responding to how consumers interact with your brand.
 Palmer: It used to be that companies would commission a study at great expense to find out what people thought about their product. Now you just go online and find out. It's really scary at first. You realize there's a whole dialogue going on outside your brand, and you can't control it.
 Bastholm: The feedback you get, though, is so much richer and more immediate than what we used to get. In focus groups, there's always one guy who sort of steals the room, so you wind up getting his opinion and no one else's. On YouTube, you put your ad up, and right away you can read the comments. It's such a democracy. 
 Rasmussen: Online marketing is kind of like a video game that way. You can keep track of precisely how many people see your content and exactly how much they relate to it. As soon as you put it out there, you can keep score. 
 Bastholm: And that's scary as well, because of the instantaneousness of it. I mean, people will call you on things in a heartbeat, and then you're stuck with a mess that everybody is describing as such. 
 Hitt: Are there brands that are resisting this kind of change?
 Palmer: Sure. Almost any household brand you would find under your sink or in your medicine cabinet. The macaroni-and-cheese products of our daily lives. They assume their business practices will carry on forever. A couple of years ago, I decided that I wanted to do some bleach advertising. I wanted to do something that everybody has in their house and nobody ever talks about. I remember meeting some people from Clorox and being like, ''Man, we should do some cool stuff and get people talking about bleach.'' And I doggedly stayed with it for a while, but it just didn't fit into their consciousness.
 Rasmussen: It's not just Clorox. Even brands that are doing very well are resistant to this change. They want to take advantage of all these new media channels, but they're afraid. 
 Bastholm: We used to joke that advertising was ''lying for a living.'' We got away with that back then. We can't anymore. And now, if we get caught in a lie, we're in trouble.
 II. FACEBOOK OVERALLS
 Hitt: Let me give you a scenario. I'm the somewhat desperate C.E.O. of a company called Jack's Overalls. We manufacture functional clothes, and in the era of corporate farming, our market is fading. My younger vice presidents are telling me that we need to try new media. So I'm turning to you: Why should I even consider these emerging media? Can't I just spend my money on old-school, 30-second spots on prime-time television?
 Bastholm: Well, we do have a ton of different new media and new ways to use them. But before we get there, I would suggest that first, you take a step backward and ask yourself, How do I make my brand relevant? Overalls are a staple of Americana, a cultural icon. The question is, How can you make overalls relevant to people today, and how can you use these different media channels to accomplish that?
 Palmer: Your customers in the past have been farmers. Overalls are a commodity. 
 Rasmussen: Very functional. And your market is shrinking.
 Palmer: So you have to create a new market. Farming may be going away, but what's on the rise? Right now your overalls are made with special pockets and holders for farming tools. Maybe we retool them for urban farmers, as it were, and their specialized gear. You have special pockets for your iPhone and your BlackBerry, and a pocket for your headphones, another for your wallet, your subway card, your keys. 
 Bastholm: Let's really take the brand into the 21st century, shall we? Why don't we put a ShotCode on the front of every single pair of overalls. A ShotCode is like a bar code. You scan it with the camera in your cellphone. And then something comes out the other end. With bar codes, it's a price. But with a ShotCode, it could be a song, it could be a picture, it could be a link to a Web site. 
 Hitt: People would come up and shoot me with a cellphone?
 Bastholm: Yes, with a phone camera. So you'd be wearing a pair of overalls, and you have your own personal ShotCode on the front. The ShotCode might take people online to a new Web site you've selected. Or a picture you took that day or your favorite song. All of a sudden you have a uniquely personalizable pair of overalls that can say something different about you on a daily basis. You'd utilize a whole bunch of screens that we haven't really seen used in clothes before, and this loop of screens is creating something completely unique.
 Rasmussen: Maybe that's something you do in partnership with Facebook or MySpace.
 Palmer: But you don't want to suddenly be seen as, like, this newfangled Internet overall company. If you're talking to somebody who's over 40, that's going to freak them out, you know? So this becomes your special-edition ShotCode overalls. You place ads only on social networks, like MySpace or Flickr. Facebook users can buy the Facebook edition of these overalls. They come precoded with your Facebook page embedded as your ShotCode. But if you're not a Facebook person, you're never going to know about this unique brand.
 Rasmussen: You can market 100 different kinds of overalls and sell those to different target groups.
 Palmer: It's self-selecting, actually. The more narrowly you talk to your audience through these new screens, the more people and products will gravitate toward one another. And nobody else will necessarily know or care that that's happening. Take Vans, for instance. They do all sorts of special customized editions. Like they'll do an Iron Maiden edition of Vans. But if you're not into Iron Maiden, you might never see that. You see it only if you gravitate toward it through these screens. 
 Rasmussen: I would recommend a Web presence built around a utility that engages consumers and allows them to take your brand and own it. Maybe you give customers the ability to mix and match your overalls with other clothes. Maybe you create a widget that lets you drag your overalls and drop them onto an existing image. And the program blends the overalls with the outfit, so you can say, ''Boom, that's how it would look if I wore a pair of cord overalls with a blue jean jacket.''
 Bastholm: Yeah, create a little viral engine called You Need Overalls, where you can take current events and just drag a pair of overalls onto whoever's in the news.
 Rasmussen: We could also create a small card -- like a business card -- with your overalls and a logo and a URL on it. The overalls are perforated and can be punched out of the card. People can then hold the cutout in front of somebody cool and take a picture with their digital camera: there's Barack Obama wearing his jacket and a pair of overalls, giving a speech. Click, I send it in to your Web page. Maybe you have samples of these user-generated images playing on digital screens in stores, on television screens in cabs and on digital billboards.
 Bastholm: My company developed this mobile application called Nike Photo ID, where you take a picture with your cellphone of anything and it sends you back a pair of sneakers in the two dominant colors in that picture. So maybe we create a site called Overall This. Send in a picture of somebody and get them back in overalls.
 Rasmussen: Then you can post the images on your Web site. Create a gallery that shows how overalls can mesh with many styles, from metro to hip-hop to blue collar. People can comment and vote on their favorites. 
 III. FRAGMENTING KATIE
 Hitt: Good news. The overalls were a big hit. In fact, I made so much money selling overalls that I bought CBS. Now I want you to help me market the ''CBS Evening News With Katie Couric.''
 Palmer: Mistake. You should have bought ''The Colbert Report.''
 Rasmussen: I'm embarrassed to say that until last week, I had never watched Katie Couric in my life. So the other day I TiVoed the CBS news. And I gotta tell you, sitting in front of the TV for that long watching news was painful to me. I realized that I never get a half-hour's worth of predigested content from one source anymore. 
 Palmer: I don't even have a TV. 
 Bastholm: Most people no longer ''watch the news.'' Every morning I check the latest headlines on the BBC's Web site. There's a Danish newspaper that I check out every day, because that's where I'm from, and then I look at The New York Times. I get a Twitter feed from CNN as well.
 Rasmussen: I get some news online, some I grab through my phone, some through blogs. I get multiple feeds, I gather it all up. Katie Couric is an outdated product, an outdated model; it's not really relevant to me. 
 Palmer: What Katie Couric is not giving us, as a mainstream evening-news anchor, is an invitation to participate. So what if we changed the format of her show? Every day she gives us a sneak preview of whom she will interview over the next week. And you can go online and post your own questions. Maybe two or three user questions end up on the evening news, and you're like a big star if she uses your question. She says your name: ''This is Robert Rasmussen's question.'' You're totally psyched. You feel awesome. And then on the Internet we post the other 17 user questions and their answers. We put those on the Internet, so there's actually like an hour of content. A half-hour is on TV, and the other half-hour is on the Internet. You start involving people in the conversation. You start using television as the theatrical component to the Internet. Because what TV offers that the Internet doesn't offer is a guarantee of fame. You know that millions of people saw that bit of you on television. 
 Bastholm: I think there's a bigger issue here. The problem with these established news shows is that they're trying to be everything for everybody. And in a situation where we all specialize and go into silos and seek out what we're interested in, that superbroad thing is going to have a really hard time working. A better brief would be to say, ''Let's ensure that Katie Couric becomes part of the stream that people dip into.'' Not necessarily on TV, but in that bigger stream of news screens that we move through all day long. Cut her up into snippets and distribute her wherever it's relevant with content that people are into. That will become the thing she's famous for. She'll be the one who delivers the news you want, wherever you want it -- on your cellphone, on your outdoor screen, on TV.
 Rasmussen: I think consumers need to be able to control their media a little bit when they deal with Katie Couric. So say you're in a taxi and you see a little promo of Katie Couric. Maybe there's a menu that says, ''These are the topics she's going to be talking about today.'' And you can get your phone to ping you when Katie Couric is talking about something you're interested in: ''On the news tonight at 6:45 she's going to talk about X.'' Then you start to get a little bit of that dialogue going back and forth. Personally, I might listen to Katie Couric only for news about politics or sports or technology. Maybe the three things I choose will be different than if I were a Middle-American mom. So Katie herself becomes a kind of menu.
 Bastholm: She also needs to change from being a persona to being a person, and that's what digital is best at. I'd begin with a Twitter feed where she's talking about what she's actually doing during the day. She'd talk about all the behind-the-scenes stuff that you don't see when she's interviewing, say, Sarah Palin. Talking very openheartedly about how she experienced that the second after she's done with the interview. So you kind of start to feel you know the person who's doing the interviewing versus just the anchor posing the questions.
 Palmer: So it's like, what does Katie Couric think about sports? What does she think about politics? What does she think about pro wrestling? What does she think about human-interest stuff? What does she think about whatever? And because we're marketing Katie Couric through numerous screens, we're giving people more ways to interact with her. It's just like the way we were using different screens to market overalls to different audiences. It might turn out that, in an ironic sort of way, I really love watching Katie Couric talk about soccer because she has no clue about soccer, and to me, that's awesome. So I have a completely different relationship with her than somebody who watches her because they think that she has a really serious approach to the economy.
 Hitt: How does any of this help CBS?
 Bastholm: It helps CBS because you can start establishing the brand Katie Couric, and she happens to have her digital home on CBS.
 Palmer: So maybe you get all Martha Stewart on Katie Couric. Maybe there's a Katie Couric channel and KatieCouric.com. Maybe it's not Katie Couric who works for CBS News but it's more like Katie Couric powered by the CBS infrastructure. Like ''Intel Inside.''
 Rasmussen: People need to accept the brand of Katie Couric into their lives. You need them to want to spend time with Katie Couric. They're not willing to do that right now. The more time they spend with Katie Couric, whether it's for free or pumped out through a million channels, the better it's going to be for CBS. 
 Bastholm: You can't turn her into Walter Cronkite. That model's dead.
 Hitt: There is an interesting contrast between this fixed 6:30 p.m. news show and this idea of this fragmented narrative throughout the day that we're going to feed Couric into: the screens in the back of the cabs, the screen in my pocket, all the other screens poking up all over town. How would that work practically? 
 Rasmussen: If you want to attract new viewers who might want to interact with the news, you need to locate streams of content where those viewers are. Maybe you put streams up a bit at a time, in subway stations and inside bus shelters. Maybe you buy digital posters that have streams of content. And you should think about what's important in the geographic areas where you locate those streams, too -- the bits could be relevant to what's going on in the cities and even the different neighborhoods where the posters are located. 
 IV. THE DEATH OF THE MASSIVE MONEY MACHINE
 Hitt: Do I really need all these new gimmicks? Why can't I just air a 30-second ad on Super Bowl Sunday for the ''CBS Evening News'' and be done with it? 
 Palmer: The Super Bowl has become an advertising event. Everybody watches and talks about the ads. But Super Bowl ads actually don't work in a persuasive way anymore. They work in a dancing monkey kind of way. 
 Bastholm: No one is saying that a Super Bowl spot won't work. As a way to launch the conversation, why not? But you have to have lots of digital follow-up planned ahead of time.
 Rasmussen: That's the way you really create connections with a brand. If there's a parity of products, and each competing TV network feels similar to me, but I've had this dialogue back and forth with one brand, then that's the brand I want to succeed; I care about that brand.
 Hitt: You care about the brand, you engage with the brand, but ultimately all you're really doing is seeing the brand -- raising name recognition -- which is what used to happen in old advertising, right?
 Palmer: There's a difference. A Super Bowl ad is broadcast and everybody sees the same ad, and it comes from a single source. And so you may have a preference as to whether you liked this ad in comparison to this other ad in the block of ads that you just saw. But when you feel like you've discovered something on the Internet, it's a different relationship to the brand. Say I was one of the first thousand people who saw that Cadbury gorilla ad -- where he drums along to Phil Collins -- and I send that out to all my friends. There's a pride that I have in having discovered that, a connection that you actually can't get with broadcast advertising. 
 Rasmussen: Think of digital as the mythical water cooler, magnified many times.
 Hitt: Let's say I take your advice and fragment Katie Couric, divide the news into a million different streams. How does this make anyone money?
 Rasmussen: You can make revenue off multiple streams of content. If you're giving somebody two minutes or three minutes of content, they're probably willing to accept a brief ad.
 Hitt: So every tidbit of content flashing at me on a screen will come monetized by some version of advertising? 
 Bastholm: Yes. But you have to make sure people don't stop watching your content because there are too many ads around it. They've always got the option of downloading it from a torrent somewhere, ad-free. There's a happy medium somewhere, and Hulu, the online video service, actually seems to have found it. On Hulu, you get about seven minutes of advertising per hour, which is a quid pro quo that most people seem to be willing to accept.
 Hitt: But how long will that last? Digital media has essentially eliminated the bottleneck of complicated technology needed to transmit visual content, right? Just as it did in eliminating the distributors of the record labels and this newspaper. Are you all potentially presiding over the dissolution of your business, like everybody else in the media?
 Rasmussen: I've heard that said before, that some of these big advertising agencies are managing their own demise. They're becoming less relevant, less profitable and less necessary. Look, I'm not saying that everything we're doing right now is perfect or that all these multiple streams are going to last forever. I think what we are saying is we're being adaptive to the way consumers take in and interact with brands. And is thatadvertising or is it marketing or is it participation? Those lines are getting blurry.
 Bastholm: At my company, we're starting to redefine ourselves from being an ad agency to being an entertainment and technology company. Because that's basically what we do; we deliver branded entertainment of various sorts through a number of different technological channels. You used to have this monolithic structure where your output was 30-second spots that cost an increasing amount of money to make, and it cost more and more money to put them on TV. That massive money machine is probably going to go away, but I think the money spent on all these different channels, at the end of the day, will probably be equal to what used to be spent on TV spots.
 Palmer: I'm not sure it all equals out. I think that for people in the marketing industry, it's objectively more difficult to get the same results or make the same amount of money as you did before.
 Bastholm: Trevor Edwards, Nike's main marketing guy, had a great quote. He said, ''Nike's not in the business of keeping media companies alive, we're in the business of connecting with consumers.'' That sums up digital pretty nicely.
 Rasmussen: Clients are not saying, ''Make us ads'' or ''Make us Web sites,'' they're saying, ''Create interaction between our brand and our customers.'' That's our job now.

HEADLINE: Lessons of Survival, From the Dot-Com Attic

BYLINE: By LESLIE BERLIN. 
Leslie Berlin is project historian for the Silicon Valley Archives at Stanford. E-mail: prototype@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IN 2002, after the dot-com bubble burst, most people were trying hard to forget the preceding years of seemingly irrational entrepreneurial exuberance. But not David Kirsch.
 Mr. Kirsch, a professor of strategy and entrepreneurship at the University of Maryland, saw a way to ensure that the next generation of entrepreneurs could avoid the problems of that bubble, or ''at least make new mistakes'': He would document what did and didn't work during the flurry of business activity around the new technology called the Internet. 
 In June of that year, he started the Digital Archive of the Birth of the Dot Com Era, usually called the Dot Com Archive (dotcomarchive.org). Shortly thereafter, a partner of a venture capital firm that was closing its doors donated every business plan that the firm had received from 1999 to 2002 -- documents covering some 1,100 companies. 
 Today, Mr. Kirsch says, the archive contains some 6.4 million e-mail messages, memos, slide presentations, photographs, marketing materials and databases representing thousands of companies. These data have begun to reveal interesting insights into the dot-com bubble.
 Azi Gera, a Ph.D. candidate who works with Mr. Kirsch, used the archive to reveal the key role that social networks play in venture capital financing. Looking at a data set of 1,018 companies, Mr. Gera determined that not a single entrepreneur received venture capital funding by submitting a business plan ''over the transom.'' By contrast, about 5 percent of entrepreneurs who knew the venture capitalist or gained a personal introduction received funding. 
 Asked what his finding meant for today's entrepreneurs, Mr. Gera says, ''In this economy, the social network will be even more necessary.''
 Another striking finding is the high percentage of dot-com businesses that survived the shakeout. Mr. Kirsch, along with Brent Goldfarb, a colleague at Maryland, and David Miller of the University of California, San Diego, have found that 48 percent of dot-com companies founded since 1996 were still around in late 2004, more than four years after the Nasdaq's peak in March 2000. 
 Mr. Kirsch says that most people are stunned by this figure; they tend to guess that about 90 percent of companies failed. He adds that the dot-com survival rate is as good as or better than that for technologies like automobiles, tires and televisions in their formative years. 
 Many of the companies that survived the dot-com bust did so by ignoring the prevailing ''Get Big Fast'' business model, Mr. Kirsch explains. Get Big Fast said that an Internet company should identify a market early and grow as quickly as possible, to shut out all competitors. 
 Instead, many survivors pursued what Mr. Kirsch calls ''micro niches'': markets that didn't offer hundreds of millions in quick profits, but still presented viable Internet-based business opportunities.
 WrestlingGear.com, a company that was started in 1998 to sell amateur wrestling equipment to high school students, is a case in point. ''It wasn't rocket science,'' says Jeffrey Pape, the company's founder and president. ''One of our focuses when we started was that we had to make money on every transaction. We paid attention to our margins. It was pretty basic.'' 
 He says the company, which is privately held, now has about $1.4 million in annual sales. 
 For Marco Rubin, principal of Exoventure Associates, a consulting firm based in Falls Church, Va., stories about individual companies are less valuable than the patterns that emerge from the collected data of many businesses. Drawing on data from the archive, conversations with venture capitalists, and a grant from the National Science Foundation, Mr. Rubin is building a software tool that he hopes will help early-stage entrepreneurs ''avoid known failure patterns.'' He is also developing a simulation environment in which entrepreneurs can, as he puts it, ''screw up in private'' before bringing their ideas to potential investors. 
 At the archive, Mr. Kirsch and Mr. Goldfarb have built a database of information on 951 companies that Mr. Kirsch says are statistically representative of businesses in the dot-com era; the database does not reveal company or employee names. It includes each company's location, a brief summary of the proposed business and outcome, and some details about key employees: their ages, educational and work experience, and their personal and professional connections to one another. 
 Mr. Rubin of Exoventure says this type of information ''goes a long way toward taking the voodoo and mysticism out'' of the start-up process.
 For its first five years, the collection of business plans in the Dot Com Archive was easily accessible via the Web, and more than 87,000 people registered to use it. Most of these people were looking for model business plans. 
 Visitors today may use the archive only after signing a nondisclosure agreement. Interested individuals can send e-mail to Mr. Kirsch through the site. It is too early to tell whether entrepreneurs or investors will find value in the data-based entrepreneurship models and algorithms being developed by Exoventure Associates and by companies like YouNoodle, based in San Francisco, which used the Dot Com Archive database to help build its own ''start-up predictor'' that forecasts the future value of a start-up company. 
 Statistical analysis is undeniably valuable. But a database entry cannot capture the nuances of individual stories that may be instructive for a future entrepreneur. Recognizing this, the Dot Com Archive also collects personal narratives. These may be particularly valuable because they include the experiences of not only successful companies but also of unfunded and failed ones. This offers the opportunity to turn on its head the maxim that ''history is written by the winners.'' 
 Mr. Pape has shared his story and contributed several WrestlingGear.com documents to the archive. ''If it were me starting over,'' he explains, ''I'd want to be learning from past mistakes of other people so I didn't do the same thing myself.''

HEADLINE: Love, Jobs & 401(k)s

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA

 BODY:
ON a good day last summer, Thomas Taccetta, a stock trader, might have checked his financial charts before plotting the day's investments. Today he is likely to check in with his psychic as well. ''I'll play the broadest index, the S.&P. 500,'' Mr. Taccetta said, ''and if she tells me she is getting a negative view, I will sell.'' 
 Since September, when the Dow collapsed, Mr. Taccetta, who trades for his own portfolio in Boca Raton, Fla., has talked with his psychic about once a month, roughly twice as often as a year ago. ''There is no rhyme or reason to the way the market is trading,'' he said. ''When conditions are this volatile, consulting a psychic can be as good a strategy as any other.'' 
 In an era when even Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary, changes his mind weekly about how to rescue the United States economy, Mr. Taccetta's decision to seek the advice of a psychic may not seem all that irrational. With Washington flinging pieces of the $700 billion bailout package around, dithering about whom to rescue -- homeowners? automakers? cousin Fred? -- a good set of tarot cards might come in handy. 
 ''Your mortgage agents, your realtors, your bankers, you can't go to these people anymore,'' said Tori Hartman, a psychic in Los Angeles. ''They're just reading a script -- at least that's how my clients feel. People are sensing that the traditional avenues have not worked, that all of a sudden this so-called security that they've built up isn't there anymore. They come to a psychic for a different perspective.''
 Psychics say their business is robust, as do astrologers and people who channel spirits, read palms and otherwise predict the future (albeit not the winning lottery numbers). Their clients, who include a growing number of men, are often professional advice-givers themselves, in fields like real estate and investments, and they typically hand over anywhere from $75 to $1,000 an hour for this form of insight. 
 ''My Web traffic is up and up and up,'' said Aurora Tower, a New Yorker who constructs spidery star charts for her growing clientele. ''People will entertain the irrational when what they consider rational collapses.'' 
 Quackery? Whatever. But after all, the nation's supposed experts on the economy, from pundits on the networks to billionaire investment bankers, have not been exactly reliable. And spiritual readings, as they are known, appear to be one of the few growth sectors in a contracting economy. 
 ''My phone is ringing off the hook,'' said Roxanne Usleman, a psychic in Manhattan.
 Ms. Usleman, who says she channels angels to advise her clients on interpersonal and financial matters, reported both a spike in traffic on her Web site and a significant surge in private consultations. She used to see comfortably 15 to 20 clients a week, she said. Now she meets with more than twice that number. ''I'm having trouble squeezing in appointments,'' she said. 
 Dawn Carr, a psychic in Boston, said her holiday bookings jumped as much as 70 percent this year over last, fueled in part by corporate bookings for holiday parties. ''These people are looking for someone not just to entertain them, but to enlighten them,'' she said. 
 Although most of us would settle for just enough telepathy to read our spouse's mind, some people crave more. 
 ''When you don't know what to expect of a job interview or a business partnership,'' said Gita V. Johar, a professor of at the Columbia University Business School, ''that is when you're most likely to turn to a psychic.'' 
 Professor Johar, whose specialty is studying the effects of superstition on consumer behavior, suggested that when your portfolio is shrinking or your business is tanking, talking to a soothsayer may be ''one way of feeling in control.'' She needed no crystal ball herself to predict that ''given the uncertainty of the economy, psychics are going to see an increase in business.'' 
 The steep prices charged by practitioners of divination do not seem to have deterred many of the financially fretful. Ms. Hartman, the Los Angeles psychic, said her Internet traffic has picked up substantially, from about 30 visitors a day to more than 200. She charges from $150 for a 30-minute telephone reading to $500 for 90 minutes of ''intuitive counseling.'' In what is perhaps a sign of the times, the $70 moss-scented prosperity candle offered on her Web site has become her best seller, she said.
 Many more men have joined the ranks of seekers. ''In the old days men would turn to their wives and ask, 'What did that goofball say, honey?' '' said Michael Lutins, a New York writer and astrologer. ''Now they are raising their heads, interested in matters that were once considered women's stuff.'' Mr. Lutin has lectured about astrology at such male-dominated institutions as the Harvard Business School Club of New York.
 Ms. Usleman said that her once predominantly female clientele has also expanded. Men -- among them lawyers, doctors, chief executives and insurance brokers -- now make up about 50 percent of her business. They approach her, she said, with highly targeted questions, as if they were grilling an investment counselor. ''Before agreeing to a reading, they will ask: 'What is your accuracy rate? Can you guarantee your readings? How do you get your information and can I depend on it?' '' 
 Aside from storefront readers, psychics rarely hang out a shingle, making their earnings hard to track. But one person who has attempted to quantify the rising popularity of psychics is Robert LoCasio, the chief executive of LivePerson.com, a site offering telephone consultations with experts in fields from finance to fly fishing.
 When he bought his company a year ago, Mr. LoCasio checked the Consumer Sentiment Index, which is published by the University of Michigan and charts consumer confidence, from 2005 through September of this year. He then compared the data with records from his own company, and drew the conclusion that when the economy is down, consultations with psychics spike noticeably. 
 Live Person earned revenues of $30 million this year, about 70 percent derived from spiritual readers, Mr. LoCasio said. ''In this day and age, a spiritual guide is an everyday therapist -- that's what the business has become,'' he said.
 In more ordinary economic cycles, psychics tend to offer guidance on romance and relationships. These days, they are besieged with questions about whether a pink slip is in the cards, whether a condo will sell, or whether a company will continue to prosper.
 Alicia Bowling, who runs a sports bar in Manhattan, consulted a psychic when friction with a business partner seemed about to imperil her livelihood. ''I used to go to my psychic about twice a year, but in the past year, yikes, I may have talked to her a dozen times,'' said Ms. Bowling, 49. ''I used to ask more about love, or will I ever be married, but with all these hard times, I wonder, 'What's going to happen to my bar and will I survive?' '' 
 Sergei Pamukh, a New York stock trader, considers himself a skeptic about supernatural matters, but softened his stance after consulting Ms. Usleman, the Manhattan psychic. When his business was flailing earlier this fall, she suggested that he travel to Moscow to meet with a billionaire mogul. ''In two or three weeks I am going,'' he said.
 Ms. Usleman said she typically fields questions these days like, ''Should I go back and live with my parents?'' and ''Is it O.K. to take my children out of private school?'' In the past, she added, ''they would ask, 'Should I have a baby?' But now they have put that on hold. 
 ''Basically, what people want to know in a troubled economy,'' she said, ''is what can they do to reinvent themselves.'' 
 Fahrusha, a Madame Blavatsky from Manhattan, said that clients have been pressing her with highly focused queries. ''They might want to know about investing in a particular security, or ask how the euro will fare against the dollar,'' she said. In flusher times, they might have consulted a financial expert, she said, ''but some of these people are experts themselves.'' 
 Maria Napoli, a Manhattan astrologer whose clientele includes a growing circle of the rich and famous in the worlds of fashion, art and finance, observed that many of her clients were fretting about a global picture, not just their careers. ''They are asking: 'Where are we headed as a country? Are we entering a depression?' I get a lot of Republicans wondering where their party is going.''
 Mostly they are after a little peace of mind.
 ''It pays to cover all your bets,'' said Stuart McFaul, who runs a marketing and public relations company in San Francisco.
 Mr. McFaul checks in with his psychic when he is stumped for answers about where his business, and his competition, might be headed. ''I'm a big believer that you really don't dismiss any opinion,'' he said. 
 Ms. Bowling, the bar owner, is grateful for the slightest shred of insight. ''In times that are this nerve-racking, all it takes is one word that kind of helps you get through your day,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Charities Struggling With Their Own Needs

BYLINE: By JAN ELLEN SPIEGEL

DATELINE: FAIRFIELD 

 BODY:
 THE Salvation Army van sitting rear-end-in at the loading dock of the Connecticut Food Bank warehouse here is packed floor to ceiling. Loaves of bread, cans of beans and stew, boxes of cereal and mac and cheese, jars of peanut butter and jelly, fresh onions, carrots and squash, and more.
 It will last less than a week, said Carla Weston, director of social services at the Salvation Army's Bridgeport center, which services an area hard-hit by foreclosures in the sub-prime mortgage crisis. More than 600 new people each month for the last several months have signed up to use the Army's food pantry, Ms. Weston said.
 ''It's nonstop,'' she said. ''There have also been ones that haven't come for years that all of a sudden are coming back.'' 
 To make matters worse, donations are slowing as the tentacles of the economic crisis reach into even well-heeled areas like Connecticut. ''Everybody's tightening belts this year,'' Ms. Weston said.
 Nonprofit organizations across the state -- especially social service ones -- are facing the same double bind of drastically increased need and decreased resources. And now, heading into the historically huge holiday fund-raising season, many are preparing for what they anticipate will be a difficult, if not devastating, time.
 ''They went from pessimistic to even more gloomy in the last month and a half,'' said Ronald Cretaro, executive director of the Connecticut Association of Nonprofits. Mr. Cretaro said there was higher-than usual interest in a conference his organization held this month on how to survive in these gloomy economic times. The state's more than 14,000 nonprofits are just starting to sort out how to deal with the as-yet uncalculated effects from potential cuts to state funds in the wake of Connecticut's projected two-year $6 billion deficit, and the impact of the stock market's vicissitudes on donors, corporate giving and investment portfolios of foundations. 
 ''We're seeing more agencies running red ink,'' he said. ''You can hide it for awhile, but you can't do it for two or three years.''
 Mr. Cretaro and others, including Nancy Roberts, president of the Connecticut Council for Philanthropy, which works with the state's more than 1,400 foundations, warn that this year's financial commitments to many nonprofits were made months ago, which means the full force of the economic trauma has not struck yet. ''What we see this year is really nothing compared to what we'll see next year or the year after,'' Ms. Roberts said. 
 Connecticut foundations distributed $710 million to worthy organizations in 2006, the most recent year for which the data is available. Ms. Roberts is coordinating a series of meetings for funders so they can determine how to maintain their contribution pace when their own portfolios, which are often tied to the stock market, are probably shrinking . ''The role of the funding community in these times is to try to support what's already there,'' she said. ''Give them operating money to keep them alive, but don't start something new.''
 Kate Lombardo, executive director of the Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County, said staying afloat would be a challenge for her organization. ''Donations have dropped off incredibly,'' said Ms. Lombardo, who joined the food bank after retiring from Goldman Sachs. ''If people don't have they can't give.'' 
 She estimates that food donations have dropped 80 percent and financial donations 50 percent, while the need has doubled. The food bank distributed 100,000 pounds of goods in October this year, compared with about 60,000 pounds last October. Ticket sales for the annual fund-raising dinner were slow.
 ''In my years I've never seen Americans so economically hogtied,'' Ms. Lombardo said.
 Nonprofit organizations are resorting to the same tactics as their for-profit brethren: layoffs, service cuts, and economic measures as basic as turning out lights.
 The Center for Women and Families of Eastern Fairfield County in Bridgeport, which helps victims of violence against women, has laid off staff members and postponed a capital campaign until at least next year. At the same time, more people are seeking help partially as a result of stress brought by economic difficulties, according to Debbie Greenwood, the center's president and chief executive.
 At Kids in Crisis in Greenwich, the executive director, Shari Shapiro, said that same stress was already sending 5 percent to 10 percent more young people to her programs. She said she was concerned what would happen as the organizations she refers clients to begin to cut back.
 ''It's a snowball that's just racing downhill,'' she said. And as year-end fund-raising letters go out, she also worries about being unable to raise the 60 percent -- or $3 million -- of her $5 million budget that normally comes from private funds.
 ''We've had a number of donors say, 'We're here for you this year,' '' Ms. Shapiro said. ''But if it doesn't turn around quickly in the next month, it could be devastating.''
 That's a scenario the Connecticut Audubon Society knows all about. Unable to get a title sponsor for its annual February Eagle Festival, an event that costs $150,000, it was forced this month to cancel next year's. ''Some of the people we were talking to said they just can't commit right now,'' said spokeswoman Mara Neville.
 For nonprofits not involved in social services, including Schooner, an environmental education group in New Haven, and the Ballet School of Stamford, there is concern that paid enrollment will decline in a bad economy, and both organizations are seeing increased requests for scholarships. An even bigger fear is that donors will see them as less critical than essential human service groups.
 ''It's going to come down to that at times --people making a decision to give to one of the local shelters as opposed to local environment organizations,'' said Schooner's executive director, Beth McCabe. 
 To ease economic concerns, Schooner is discussing a partnership with the University of New Haven, and the ballet school is consolidating office work with other groups in its building.
 ''We're all out there trying to make the cuts where we can,'' said Marti Etter, the ballet school's executive director. ''But there's a limit to the cuts we can make.''
 Which is what Kevin Simmons, executive director of the Burroughs Community Center in Bridgeport, discovered after engineering layoffs, energy efficiency and other streamlining. He decided to try something completely different -- dumping the annual fund-raising dance and auction and substituting a midwinter polar bear plunge he called Freezin' for a Reason. It raised $64,000 -- just about equal to the best year the dance ever had.
 ''Nobody really knows where the bottom is going to be with the economic situation,'' he said. ''But that doesn't change the fact that people want to help.''
 Susan Clemow, whose Clemow Consulting Group in Bloomfield advises nonprofits on fund-raising, says inventive tactics like those at Burroughs and Schooner are important in difficult times, as is reining in expenses. But this is her main advice: ''This is not a donor acquisition kind of time. It's a time to hang on to what you've got and make them understand you need them more than ever.''
 That is not always easy, as Merle Berke-Schlessel, president and chief executive of United Way of Coastal Fairfield County, found out during recent fund-raising at a hospital. ''I talked to a nurse who lost her investment account that had her kid's college savings,'' Ms. Berke-Schlessel said. ''She was sobbing because she didn't feel she could make her contributions.''
 Ms. Berke-Schlessel's organization is the merger of three United Ways that together would normally raise $7 million to $8 million for organizations whose needs she said that she expected would increase as a result of the economy. Eighty percent of that money is typically pledged now -- from late summer to the early part of the new year. ''We're extremely nervous,'' Ms. Berke-Schlessel said.
 Because many of her contributors were from hard-hit financial companies, she said that she hoped to find younger donors who could pledge small amounts and that she wanted to identify ways to use the Internet to United Way's advantage. ''We're all looking through the windshield instead of the rear view mirror,'' she said. ''We're trying to figure out where to go.''

HEADLINE: For a Thrifty Audience, Buying DVDs Is So 2004

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 MATTHEW BOWERS, of Chicago, has been paying to have HBO piped into his home every month for nearly two decades. He tunes in for the occasional episode of ''Entourage'' and every couple of months orders a movie on demand. Recently, the whole family watched ''Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street.''
 But when his company laid him off in September, he started to think about the value he was getting out of the premium cable channel. ''It's ridiculous to pay for this service I rarely use when I can get the same stuff online and save a lot of money,'' he said. The result? HBO is losing a customer. 
 Does an economy in tatters slow down or speed up the shift to watching TV shows and movies on the Web and mobile devices? The entertainment industry doesn't like the answer that is rapidly becoming clear: A global economic crisis almost certainly means a sharp acceleration in the move to new ways of consuming content, setting the stage for a new clash between consumers and studios.
 Historically, the movie factories haven't been terribly afraid of tough economic times. In fact, they have almost welcomed them. During the Great Depression, people continued to turn to the movies for escape. VHS rentals boomed during the recession of the early 1980s, while DVDs got a boost from the downturn earlier this decade.
 And an HBO spokesman said he was sorry to see Mr. Bowers go, but he dismissed the notion that many other people would be joining him. ''No industry is recession-proof, but pay television has performed very well in previous downturns,'' said the spokesman, Jeff Cusson.
 But the current gloom has the Hollywood establishment rattled. DVDs are now where the industry makes its money, and Nielsen VideoScan reported a 9 percent drop in DVD sales in the third quarter over the quarter a year earlier -- before the economy ran into a buzz saw. In television, crucial car advertising is drying up.
 Moreover, consumers now have cheaper ways to see movies and TV shows. Hulu. Vudu. YouTube. Netflix. Amazon Video on Demand. iTunes. Crackle. FunLittleMovies.com. Movielink. CinemaNow. The list goes on. As a result, movie and television studios seem more intent than ever on protecting their established businesses from cannibalization by new media, which are growing rapidly but still generating very little revenue comparatively. 
 Warner Brothers Television, which supplies ''The Mentalist'' and ''Eleventh Hour'' to CBS, recently asked the network to pull full-length episodes from its Web site, along with the comedy ''Big Bang Theory.'' The thinking is that they were potentially too hurtful to old-fashioned syndication sales to television stations down the road.
 Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's recent deal with YouTube to stream full-length movies and TV episodes did not include any of the studio's prize assets like the James Bond movies or ''Rocky.'' Instead, MGM is giving YouTube movies like the flop ''Bulletproof Monk'' and reruns of the original ''American Gladiators'' series -- a safe deal for this stage of the game. (MGM says that more-sought-after content will follow, and notes that it has been one of the more aggressive movie studios when it comes to disseminating content on new platforms.)
 Studio experimentation in digital distribution is going by the wayside, too. When DVD sales were booming a couple of years ago, for instance, companies could afford to stream a TV show here and a movie there. But with operating income at 20th Century Fox down 31 percent in the recent quarter over the year-earlier period, and Walt Disney Pictures down 42 percent, studios are newly afraid.
 ''The days of studios making little digital deals so they can put out a press release and look enlightened are over,'' said Steve Mosko, the president of Sony Pictures Television, who also oversees digital distribution of Sony films. ''The days of making this a real business are here,'' he said. 
 The problem is that consumers are clamoring for the product even if it doesn't make money for the studio. ''I see people demanding an enormous acceleration in professionally produced Web and mobile video,'' said David van Eyssen, an independent film producer who recently signed a production deal with Paramount Digital Entertainment. ''The low-cost alternative to traditional media is the Internet.''
 A JupiterResearch study, released in late September, asked consumers how the troubled economy would affect their media spending habits. Among adults ages 25 to 34 -- the group of young adults cherished by media companies -- movie tickets and premium cable channels were the first to go. The last was broadband.
 Think nobody wants to watch a two-hour movie on a computer or hand-held device? When ''Iron Man,'' starring Robert Downey Jr., became available on iTunes in late September, it sold more than $1 million in $2.99 downloads in its first seven days of release, analysts say. That's almost pure profit, because the cost of delivery is so low, analysts note. But it's still a drop in the bucket compared with the $140 million in DVD revenue that ''Iron Man'' racked up in its first week.
 ''We've been pleasantly surprised at how much revenue is starting to come from sites like Hulu,'' said John Sloss, an entertainment lawyer and founder of Cinetic Rights Management, a firm that helps independent filmmakers distribute their work on new platforms.
 Not all studios are circling the wagons. Sony, for one, increasingly believes that new and old media businesses are complementary. ''When TV came along, people thought it would ruin movies, but it didn't,'' said Mr. Mosko. ''It's the same situation here. These businesses can coexist.'' (Sony, of course, makes a lot of money from digital devices.)
 Most media companies are in a tighter spot. But James L. McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research, predicts that any renewed efforts by studios to dig in their heels will be futile. ''At this point, slowing down the flow of movies and TV shows to new platforms would be a little bit like cutting off a drug from a junkie,'' he said. ''People want more, more, more.''

HEADLINE: A New Elevator: The Nuts and Bolts

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
UNDER a new city building code taking effect next year, elevators will undergo far more stringent inspections than in the past. Now is a good time for buildings with older elevators to consider modernizing. 
 An elevator's useful life is 20 to 25 years. Typically, the first step in the updating process is to hire an elevator consultant to evaluate its condition, write the plans and specifications, analyze bids and manage the project. 
 In a six-story building, a standard elevator modernization (frequently involving replacement of the cab rather than remodeling it) costs about $100,000, including consultant fees, said Joseph Caracappa, an elevator consultant who is the vice president of the Sierra Consulting Group in Manhasset, L.I.
 A project in a 6- to 12-story building generally costs around $125,000, while anything taller will require roughly $150,000 to $175,000. 
 Mr. Caracappa, who consulted on my building's project, said that these figures assume that some components won't need changing. Our 89-year-old drum-hoisted elevator, being well past its sell-by date, needed everything, which is why our job cost substantially more. Also, we spent about $20,000 on the interior finishes, on the higher side of a range from $7,500 to $30,000.
 Many buildings prefer summer work, when residents are often away at least part of the time. The typical lead time is six months from the hiring of a consultant to the day the job begins.
 Projects take from 8 to 12 weeks, Mr. Caracappa said, depending on the height of the building, the components being retained, and the desired aesthetics. 
 Buildings with a single elevator -- ''the worst-case scenario,'' Mr. Caracappa said -- often insist that the contractor pay a penalty of $500 to $1,000 for every day behind schedule. But buildings may also give a bonus for early completion. Overtime can get the job done faster. (We paid $4,000 to $5,000 for every week trimmed.) 
 Owners and boards have no obligation to find alternate housing for inconvenienced or disabled residents, said Steven R. Wagner, a real estate lawyer at Wagner Davis in Manhattan. But they must make ''reasonable accommodations.'' 
 ''Part of the consideration of whether something is reasonable is the cost,'' Mr. Wagner said. ''Others include the duration of the work, the options available to the residents and landlord, and the effect the accommodation may have on other residents.''
 Speaking from personal experience, I strongly advise single-elevator buildings not to economize on porter service. Arrange for daily coverage from early morning to late evening, with deference paid to the needs of residents of higher floors, the physically challenged and those with young children.

HEADLINE: Against-the-Grain Defense

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

DATELINE: NASHVILLE 

 BODY:
It was not long after Jim Schwartz began an unpaid internship with the old Cleveland Browns, driving scouts and players to the airport, and buying cigarettes for the coaches, that he bumped up against football's poured-in-concrete conventional wisdom. 
 Schwartz, now the defensive coordinator for the Tennessee Titans, had an economics degree from Georgetown University, an abiding fascination with statistics and a preference for watching game film over television. That made him a kindred spirit with his first N.F.L. boss, Bill Belichick. But when Schwartz told Belichick his findings from an early N.F.L. research project almost 15 years ago, Belichick said he did not believe him. 
 ''Fumbles are a random occurrence,'' Schwartz said he told Belichick. ''Being able to get interceptions or not throw interceptions has a high correlation with good teams. But over the course of a year, good teams don't fumble any more or less than bad teams. Bill didn't agree. He said, 'No, good teams don't fumble the ball.' But actually, they fumble just as often as bad teams.''
 With the Titans, Schwartz once encouraged the former offensive coordinator Norm Chow to run more on third-and-short because his research indicated that it was more effective than passing. 
 Unorthodox thinking like that has earned Schwartz, 42, a reputation as one of the N.F.L.'s leading practitioners of statistical analysis -- ''Moneyball'' for the shoulder-pad set -- using them in coaching the defense for the league's only unbeaten team. 
 In Schwartz's eighth season as the coordinator, the Titans' defense is ranked sixth entering Sunday's game here against the Jets (7-3). The ranking is based on yards surrendered. 
 ''Who cares who is leading in yardage?'' Schwartz said, pointing out that allowing a 12-yard run raises the total but is meaningless on a third-and-20 play. 
 No statistic matters more to coaches than fewest points allowed, and by that measure, no team comes close to the Titans (10-0). They are giving up 13.1 points a game, 1.4 points fewer than the second-ranked Pittsburgh Steelers. But Schwartz, perhaps more aware than most of how numbers can be manipulated, did not embrace that figure without explanation. 
 The Titans gave up their most points of the season, 21, to Indianapolis. But the Colts scored 7 points with little time remaining, when the Titans were leading by 17. Against Kansas City, the Titans allowed 10 late points after the starters were pulled in a 34-10 victory. So the Titans average fewer than 13.1 meaningful points allowed. 
 With an offense that relies on the run, not downfield passing, the Titans are built to win close (read playoff) games. That leaves the defense with little margin for error. 
 The Titans are defined by multitalented players who are effective in different styles. The Titans used eight-man fronts to stop Jacksonville's running game in the season opener, then played a cover-2 defense to thwart Cincinnati's passing the next week. 
 With a line featuring Albert Haynesworth, perhaps the league's best defensive player, the Titans generate pressure on quarterbacks with minimal blitzing. (An addendum to Schwartz's fumble analysis: good teams sack the quarterback, and forcing a quarterback to fumble is a lot easier than taking the ball from a running back or a wide receiver.)
 Players credit the defensive coaches for their ability to correct mistakes quickly -- the Chicago Bears converted three consecutive third-down attempts on their opening drive against the Titans, but none the rest of the game -- and for the detailed preparation that dovetails with what linebacker Keith Bulluck called Schwartz's ''little hobbies.'' 
 Kyle Vanden Bosch said: ''Especially from a defensive lineman standpoint, we don't usually pay attention to formations and down and distance. He has that broken down for us. We know what to expect out of certain formations, and what plays they can run. It's unusual for a defensive line. But we have a quiz in front of the whole defense on Friday, and he expects everybody to know that.''
 Belichick regards Schwartz as one of the smartest coaches he has been around, and in recent years, Schwartz has become a candidate for several head coaching jobs. He is almost certain to be a front-runner as positions open this year.
 But being known as a ''stats guy'' is not necessarily a compliment, because statistics do not hold the romantic place in football that they do in baseball. Although every coach uses plenty of data -- the Titans' Jeff Fisher tracks how long his team takes to break the huddle -- football is unlikely to bestow statistics-driven celebrity on anyone the way the baseball book ''Moneyball'' did on Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics. 
 Schwartz has met with the developers of a computer program to analyze difficult play-calling decisions, and he has watched film with Aaron Schatz, an author of ''Pro Football Prospectus,'' who uses unusual statistics to analyze the game. But at the same time, Schwartz shuns the impression that creates, stressing that statistics are just another tool in game preparation.
 ''Sometimes, that's an easy thing for people in the media to use against you,'' Schwartz said. '' 'Oh, yeah, he can't adjust; he's just a stats guy. They don't really understand the game.' That's why sometimes, the whole stats thing is a dirty word.
 ''If you ask me, Would you rather have a great fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants guy on Sunday, a guy who can dial up plays and he'd be the best in league, or a guy who is best in the league from Monday to Saturday preparing, I respect the guy who prepares. You're not always going to be rolling 7, 7, 7 and be hot every week. But if you prepare well during the week, you'll be consistent from week to week.'' 
 Numbers have long threaded through Schwartz's thinking. His father was a police officer, and when they watch television together and see a news report about a murder, his father will mention what percentage of women are murdered by their husbands. When Schwartz was growing up in Baltimore, the Dallas Cowboys were the best team in football. They used a computer analysis of prospects as part of their forward-thinking draft preparation. 
 ''They used that not to press a button and have the computer say, 'This is your draft pick,' '' Schwartz said. ''It was more to guide them -- these are important traits to look for. That's the way we use it.''
 The 16-game season provides a small sample, a shortcoming of football statistics. So Schwartz breaks down each drive as if it were its own game. Twelve drives, say, multiplied by 16 games is a much bigger sample. 
 Yet Schwartz rejects one Beane quirk revealed in ''Moneyball'' -- that he does not like to watch games because he cannot stand how random events may influence the outcome. Schwartz, a former college linebacker, calls the defensive signals from the sideline rather than the press box, so he can look at his players and gauge their physical feedback. The Titans' attacking style -- what Vanden Bosch called ''forcing the issue'' -- seems to run counter to the by-the-numbers image that makes Schwartz uncomfortable.
 ''This guy is a football coach who motivates players,'' Schatz said, ''and he also happens to have a very open mind and interest in statistics. But he's not like me on the sidelines.''
 Still, with Tennessee on the way to the playoffs, the Titans' pounding defense -- and the mind that directs it -- figure to get plenty of attention. Schwartz cringes when he thinks others perceive him as a numbers geek, an odd concern for an avid amateur chess player who uses Bobby Fischer and Garry Kasparov analogies. 
 ''People talk about the chess match between coaches and coordinators,'' Schwartz said. ''Anybody who plays chess knows your rook never falls down, your rook never stops one spot short. There's human nature to football that will never make it into a game of numbers.''

HEADLINE: A High-Mileage Masterpiece

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
WHEREVER menfolk gathered for Thanksgiving, before the turkey and after exhausting discussion of that seventh-round draft pick from Clemson, the phrase ''What kind of mileage does she get?'' was a reliable conversation starter.
Heads would nod sagely, but until recently nobody cared a lot. In surveys of car shoppers, fuel economy often didn't make the top 10 on the priority list.
So now, with interest in the Prius exceeding that in pickups, you know times have changed. While the recent dip in gas prices has some analysts worried about an S.U.V. sequel -- Return to Guzzle Beach? -- I suspect that most middle-class consumers aren't ready to bet five years of car payments that a gallon of unleaded will stay around $2. Many won't be betting on a new car at all.
That makes the 2009 Volkswagen Jetta TDI a smart hedge play. 
This diesel-powered sedan or wagon is frugal on the front end, starting at $22,640 with a six-speed manual transmission. A $1,300 alternative-fuel tax credit becomes a de facto rebate, cutting the base price to about $21,000.
The Jetta is frugal in the middle years, with a rating of 30 miles a gallon in town and 41 on the highway. The tiny two-seat Smart is the only nonhybrid car that can match the 41 m.p.g. rating.
But like many new clean diesels, which meet even California's tough emissions rules, the Jetta scoffs at its sticker. Hoarding fuel like a mobile Scrooge, I averaged a remarkable 48 m.p.g. over more than 150 miles of freeway driving. That's the best mileage of any American-market car I've tested -- gas, diesel or hybrid. I never knew that driving a steady 60 m.p.h. could be so gratifying, and I vowed to try it more often.
Finally, the Jetta should be frugal on the back end. Diesel VWs have historically retained more value than gas-powered models. Diesel aficionados seek them out on the used-car market. Their engines are famously durable.
Among a wave of diesel cars and trucks -- whose advanced emissions systems let them meet pollution rules in all 50 states -- the Jetta is the people's choice, costing half as much as diesels from Audi, BMW and Mercedes-Benz. The VW is also the current champion of diesel economy. And its 4-cylinder engine achieves impressively low emissions without the need to carry several gallons of liquid urea, which helps to cleanse the emissions of larger diesel cars and S.U.V.'s.
Like most new diesels, the Jetta combines a turbocharger and ultra-high-pressure fuel injectors to raise power and precisely tailor combustion, with up to five sprays of fuel for every big bang. Gone are the drawbacks of older diesels: there's no smell, no smoke, no shake. With 140 horsepower and an impressive 236 pound-feet of torque, the TDI is barely louder at idle than a gasoline Jetta; it actually seems quieter on the road.
While the Jetta is officially a compact, in practical terms it bridges the gap between small and midsize models. The enormous trunk has more usable space than those of many bigger sedans. The back seat is spacious enough to handle three adults in a pinch, with a relatively broad and comfortable center perch.
The interior looks mildly Spartan, but in a German, Hugo Boss way that softens the blow. Handsome gauges and shapely, supportive seats are familiar VW items. All told, the Jetta feels more sophisticated and comfortable than the Toyota Prius.
With all the torque hunkered at low engine speeds, the diesel doesn't rev to the sporty heights of gasoline Jettas. The suspension is mildly underdamped, meaning the TDI rides softly but seesaws briefly after absorbing high-speed dips. Standard 16-inch wheels and low-resistance tires save fuel, not time.
But compared with a docile Prius or Civic Hybrid, the Jetta is virtually a road warrior. The VW churns up all the passing power you'd want from 30, 50 or even 70 m.p.h. The steering is sporty and precise. Add a stiff suspension and sticky tires, and the TDI would be a credible Euro-style sport sedan, sacrificing perhaps 1 or 2 m.p.g.
The Jetta also brakes like a normal car. In contrast, applying a hybrid's brakes -- connected to regenerative systems that return energy to the battery -- is like stepping into a tuna casserole.
--
The manual transmission is a bit easy to stall in first gear, but you can crawl in second with no need to hold the accelerator, making for less clutching and rowing in traffic. VW's terrific dual-clutch automated manual transmission -- which has been mimicked by Porsche, BMW and others -- costs $1,100 extra and brings a 29/40 mileage rating.
In my week with the Jetta it became clear that the VW can indeed top 50 m.p.g. if you stay under 60 m.p.h. and treat the gas pedal as if there's an egg under it.
After my long 48-m.p.g. run, I started over and switched personalities, transforming into a late-for-school Autobahn instructor. Never dipping below 75 m.p.h., flogging every curve, the Jetta still returned a reasonable 36 m.p.g. When I flowed with traffic at 65 to 70 m.p.h., and made no effort to goose the mileage, the VW posted 42 m.p.g. And in city driving, the Jetta hit 32 m.p.g, again topping its official rating.
Yet my thrift was no match for Helen and John Taylor. In September, the Taylors, from Australia, drove a production Jetta TDI to a Guinness world record, averaging an incredible 58.8 m.p.g. for a 9,400-mile run through the 48 contiguous American states. The Taylors used just 11 tanks of fuel over 20 days, averaging 850 miles for each tank.
My test car had a garish hood decal proclaiming that achievement and the rear bumper advertised goodcleandieselfun.com.
More recognition came Thursday at the Los Angeles auto show, where Green Car Journal named the Jetta TDI the Green Car of the Year. Judges included prominent envionmentalists and auto enthusiasts including Jay Leno.
Drive a diesel for even a few weeks and you realize that the supposed scarcity of pumps is an urban myth. More than 40 percent of American stations dispense diesel, so if one doesn't have it the next one usually does. All those semis and work-crew pickups are fueling up somewhere, right?
For now, the downer is the price: $2.95 a gallon on average compared with $2.05 for regular unleaded. The current price gap offsets most of the Jetta's 10 m.p.g. advantage.
But diesel prices, which have been unusually volatile of late, may yet return to something closer to parity with gasoline. (For many years, diesel cost less.) Even with today's high diesel prices, a TDI owner is likely to spend $50 to $150 a year less than someone with a gasoline Jetta (though perhaps $500 more than a Prius owner).
The TDI costs just $700 more than the gasoline model (including the federal tax credit). Just a month ago, the diesel engine would theoretically pay for itself in 1.5 years of driving. Today's higher premium for diesel has stretched that payback period to some five to seven years.
Since hybrids are the golden child in the public's mind, talking about diesels necessitates a head-to-head comparison. But I've always argued that diesels and hybrids aren't a zero-sum game. It's possible to extol diesel's virtues without dismissing hybrid technology, and vice-versa.
In that vein, if your commute involves tearing your hair out in freeway gridlock, a Prius or Civic Hybrid will still beat the mileage of a comparable diesel car. Diesel fans, no matter what you say on your blog, your old soot-spewing Rabbit will not touch those hybrids' 40-50 m.p.g. in low-speed traffic. The same goes if you live in an urban paradise and spend 20 minutes driving 20 blocks.
But if you cruise relatively unhindered through suburban hill and exurban dale, the modern diesel has the clear edge in both economy and entertainment value. Even in the city, the Jetta's 30-plus m.p.g. is a quantum leap over a conventional gasoline car.
That makes the VW a real solution to real problems. The TDI is easy on money, fuel and the planet. It just needs Americans to give it a spin and a fair shake.

HEADLINE: Bringing Down the House, More Than Any Other State

BYLINE: By JACQUELINE MROZ

 BODY:
IF you live in an affluent part of the state, look around: A teardown is probably going on in your community right now. 
 You can find a house that has been demolished and rebuilt, usually as a bigger home, by looking for a structure that stands out significantly from the other homes on the block. 
 For the past six years, the National Trust for Historic Preservation has rated New Jersey the No. 1 teardown state in the nation. But the trend may be changing with the weakening economy and deflated housing market.
 ''We're seeing a slowdown across the board,'' said John Barba, vice president of the classics division of K. Hovnanian, the largest home builder in New Jersey. ''Some markets are doing better than others, but we're definitely feeling the effects of Wall Street.''
 K. Hovnanian Classics was formed three years ago to focus exclusively on buying houses in upscale communities like Summit, Morris Township and Chatham and razing them to build more luxurious homes.
 Big houses can bring big profits. For example, the company can buy an older home in any one of those towns for around $800,000, knock it down and build a five-bedroom colonial in its place -- complete with high-end appliances, wireless computer network, intercom system and central air-conditioning -- and sell it for $1.4 million to $2.3 million, Mr. Barba said.
 ''There are some people who won't even look at resales when they're buying a house -- they only want new construction,'' he said. ''It's the same reason people don't want used cars. They just want new.''
 In addition to the towns where K. Hovnanian has been rebuilding, teardowns have been concentrated in the affluent bedroom communities of Bergen County and along the Jersey Shore.
 Some people object to teardowns because they feel that the new, often larger homes, or ''McMansions,'' can ruin the character of a neighborhood, said Adrian Fine, director of the Northeast Field Office of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. 
 ''They feel like they've lost control of the place where they live,'' Mr. Fine said. ''When you take away the houses one by one, you take away what a neighborhood feels like and looks like, and then the community changes.''
 Stacey Ruhle Kliesch of the firm GK&A Architects in Rutherford, the president-elect of the American Institute of Architects' New Jersey chapter, said she was starting to see more homeowners working with what they have, in part because of the financial situation, but also because of increased zoning restrictions and a greater awareness of sustainable designs and the environment.
 ''Some people prefer to start over from scratch -- unfortunately, their perception is that the house is old and decrepit,'' said Ms. Kliesch, who lives with her family in a 100-year-old Victorian home in Ridgewood. ''But you often see better materials and craftsmanship on these older homes. 
 ''My priority is to try and rescue a home and modify it for a family. That's more sustainable than tearing something down and producing all that construction debris, which is the No. 1 item found in landfills.''

HEADLINE: Check Cashers, Redeemed

 BODY:
Douglas McGray's article (Nov. 9) shined a light on a little discussed but promising new effort: bringing the ''unbanked'' into the financial mainstream. We know firsthand of its benefits. Two years ago, San Francisco introduced the first comprehensive initiative to bank the unbanked by encouraging financial institutions to modify their products and policies to attract lower-income consumers. The results far surpassed our expectations. More than 18,000 residents have opened accounts with ''Bank on San Francisco.'' This means people keep more of what they earn -- particularly important now when money is tight. That's why almost 60 cities and states are looking to replicate our efforts.
 JOSE CISNEROS Treasurer City and County of San Francisco San Francisco 
 On a transactional basis, financial-service centers (F.S.C.'s) charge less than banks when the bank customer does not keep a required minimum balance. Without the offsetting balances that most middle-class people keep on deposit, banks cannot provide transactions as cheaply as check-cashing companies. As Douglas McGray correctly observed, F.S.C.'s provide transparency, coupled with a high degree of access and personal service. But F.S.C.'s provide something even more precious to our customers that banks don't: liquidity. If you're living paycheck to paycheck, you cannot afford to wait several days for a check to clear. The average 2 percent fee that most check-cashing customers pay is a bargain for the value received. By getting beyond the stereotype of ''banks good, F.S.C.'s bad,'' we will be in a better position to devise enhanced service models, of which Nix/ Kinecta is a sterling example, for helping the low-income customer begin to transition from transaction-based to account-based financial services.
 JOSEPH COLEMAN Chairman Financial Service Centers of America Bronx
 Douglas McGray's article on check cashing distorts the harsh reality behind the payday-loan business: the industry relies on charging borrowers outrageous interest on short-term loans that trap people in an inescapable cycle of debt.
 Friendly, personalized customer service does not make up for ripping people off with usurious payday loans. Credit unions and banks should be providing affordable small-loan products that truly meet the needs of their customers. Congress already passed legislation to protect military personnel from the payday-loan debt trap by prohibiting loans to active-duty service members and capping the annual percentage rate at 36 percent. It's time for lawmakers to extend this protection to all consumers.
 LIANA MOLINA Organizer California Reinvestment Coalition San Francisco
 Back in 1949, when I was fresh out of college, my pay came in an envelope holding dollar bills and coins. At the time there were no credit cards. Payment in cash saved me a visit to a bank in my free time just to cash a paycheck. Today, my pay is credited directly to my bank account, and I pay for things with my credit card. Workers without a bank account can't do this. Employers should pay their workers who have no bank account in cash, particularly if the worker has no biometric ID like a driver's license. Alternatively, the employer could send wages directly to a debit card the employer has set up for such workers. As it stands, the employer is saving money at the expense of his lowest-paid workers by forcing them to pay to have their checks cashed.

HEADLINE: A Hotel Chain Turns Upscale in China

BYLINE: By FRED A. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
TRY to picture a Days Inn in a provincial Chinese city. Forget the rows of rooms facing a parking lot -- that's the American version -- and think instead of a palatial lobby with marble floors and walls and ornate crystal chandeliers.
 Like hotels built in China by other American chains, Days Inns are almost unrecognizable to those familiar with their American counterparts. 
 But in a country where labor costs are cheap -- construction workers earn as little as $100 a month -- hotel owners can afford to lay the luxuries on thick. And Chinese customers, ''when they hear an American name, expect something special,'' said Harry Tan, the chief executive of the Frontier Group and the mastermind behind the expansion of the Days Inn chain in China. 
 ''We couldn't put a foreign name on it and have it look like a local hotel,'' he said. 
 Mr. Tan said that Holiday Inn, which has been in China since the 1980s, raised the bar with fancy lobbies and lavish guest rooms, and ''we had to follow.''
 Then, too, most of the hotels managed by Days Inn China, which is part of the Singapore-based Frontier Group, are owned by people who have already made money in other businesses. 
 ''They build for prestige value,'' Mr. Tan said. ''To be able to tell their friends, 'Come stay in my hotel' gives them a lot of face,'' he said. ''They aren't expecting a quick payback.''
 In 2003, Mr. Tan and his brother, David, became the master franchisees for Days Inns in China, under a 25-year agreement with the Wyndham Hotel Group, which is based in Parsippany, N.J., and owns the Days Inn brand (as well as Super 8, Ramada, Howard Johnson and others). The Tans' company -- David is deputy chief executive -- signs 10- or 15-year contracts to run the hotels in exchange for management and franchise fees. Wyndham, in turn, gets a cut. 
 When the Tan bothers took over, other American hotel chains like Marriott and Holiday Inn were already thriving in China. By contrast, there was only one Days Inn hotel in the country, Harry Tan said. The chain is now operating 25 hotels, and has about the same number under construction; the hotels have the titles Days Inn, Days Hotel or Days Hotel and Suites, depending on their amenities.
 Most of the hotels' customers -- both leisure and business travelers -- are Chinese. In the big cities, like Beijing (where the Tans' office is located), Westerners may sometimes outnumber Chinese during peak tourist seasons. But in smaller cities, the ratio of Chinese guests to Westerners is as high as 20 to 1, Mr. Tan said.
 That means he must cater to Chinese tastes. Among other things, Chinese travelers don't look for plush beds. ''We have to make them hard,'' Mr. Tan said, ''and if I served just a continental breakfast, like they do in the U.S., I'd be in big trouble.''
 Mr. Tan, who got his start in the business working as a front-office manager at a Holiday Inn in Tibet in the 1980s, credits Wyndham with allowing his company to tailor Chinese hotels to the Chinese market, creating what he calls ''territory standards.''
 Except in Beijing and Shanghai, rooms typically go for the equivalent of $30 or $40 a night. ''Our pricing strategy is to be higher than the local hotels,'' he added, ''but not by much.''
 At those prices, he said, it may take a hotel owner 15 years or more to earn back his investment. But Chinese owners, he said, are generally patient.
 By some measures, China's economy is slowing. But the expected growth in the hotel industry is still enormous, according to Patrick Ford, the president of Lodging Econometrics, a hotel research firm in Portsmouth, N.H. ''There are great opportunities in China for these midpriced brands,'' Mr. Ford said.
 China's burgeoning urban population is partly behind the hotel growth; the country had more than 90 cities with one million or more people in 2005, according to a United Nations report. The move from rural to urban environs is ''the biggest migration in the history of the world,'' said Mr. Ford, who has made a number of trips to China. 
 Also, he said, ''Chinese people are moving up the economic scale -- and one of the first things people do when they move up the economic scale is travel.'' 
 As of the second quarter of 2008, 1,240 hotels were being planned or built in China, and nearly 90 percent of them will be affiliated with a chain, Mr. Ford said. (Some of the Chinese chains include Jin Jiang, Home Inn and Green Tree.) 
 MR. TAN said that being able to use the Days Inn name strengthens his pitch to hotel owners. ''When I tell people Wyndham, they look on the Web site,'' he said, and see the enormous size of the company. ''To them, we're like McDonald's or KFC.''
 Still, Mr. Tan said, signing up hotels was difficult at the beginning. He recalled that people would say, ''I don't want to be the first. Come back when you have 10, and I'll be the 11th.'' The first year, he said, he signed just six hotels.
 Now, he said, he is hoping to build his chain to 200 or 300 hotels, mostly through new development. ''We want numbers,'' he said.
 It helps that several other American chains got there before him, Mr. Tan said. ''In Shanghai there are already 10 Marriotts.'' 
 The owner of a new hotel, he said, ''would rather it be the first Days Inn in a city than the 11th Marriott.'' Then, too, the developer may not have a choice: Franchisees generally control exclusive territories, forcing the developers of newer properties to seek out different brands.
 For that reason, Mr. Tan said, ''being late to the market might not be a bad thing.''

HEADLINE: In Downturn, Charities Face Needs of Their Own

BYLINE: By MARY JO PATTERSON

 BODY:
EVERY November, as the days shorten and a chill fills the air, planners and volunteers at the Valerie Fund, a children's charity in Maplewood, attend to last-minute preparations for its annual Thanksgiving Ball.
 The menu changes, but other ingredients served up in the twinkling ballroom of the Hilton Short Hills remain the same: cocktails, dinner, dancing, a live auction and -- blanketing everything -- the warm glow that comes from giving. The charity, founded in 1976 by a Warren couple, Ed and Sue Goldstein, in memory of their daughter, serves children with cancer and blood disorders.
 Last fall, riding the coattails of an economy that would propel its annual revenue to $2.5 million -- up from $1.4 million only four years before -- the Valerie Fund raised $354,000 through the ball. But this year, organizers say they expect that the amount taken in by the $450-per-person event, held this weekend, will fall as much as 20 percent. Bidding on the live auction's flashiest items -- like a three-night London weekend for two, with round-trip plane fare and theater tickets -- could drop 30 percent. 
 ''We were O.K. here until about the middle of September,'' said Barry Kirschner, the fund's executive director since 2003. ''Since then, the general level of phone calls, Web site hits and donations is down by about a third. People will still come to the ball, just not with the high dollar.'' 
 There are more than 28,000 charitable organizations in New Jersey, according to the Center for Non-Profits in North Brunswick, and many are singing the blues. A sinking stock market, rising unemployment and fading consumer confidence have combined to affect their year-end fund-raising. Although the full impact will not be clear until January, they are bracing themselves.
 The economy is more diversified in New Jersey than in states like Michigan, where widespread unemployment among auto workers has decimated some United Way workplace collections. New Jersey is also not as dependent on Wall Street's distressed financial institutions as New York.
 But there are clear signs of trouble. 
 Consider the Hyacinth AIDS Foundation in New Brunswick, which held its annual fall gala in Basking Ridge last week without a grand sponsor. 
 ''Last year, a pharmaceutical company sponsored us, with $30,000,'' said Jerry McCarthern, Hyacinth's director of development. ''This year we got no money at all.''
 Or the Mt. Pleasant Animal Shelter in East Hanover. Mutts Mania, its biggest event, attracted 4,000 attendees this fall. Last year, 10,000 came.
 ''The weather was crummy, but we also had trouble recruiting sponsors,'' said Michelle Chalmers, the shelter's chief fund-raiser. ''We are in dire need of funds to keep us going.''
 In Hillside, the Community FoodBank of New Jersey, serving 1,600 food programs statewide, says it may have to ration food for the first time. Demand for food is up 30 percent, but donations are down by 20 percent, said Kathleen DiChiara, its director. Receipts for a two-week period in September suggested similar falloff even in the food bank's continuing Check-Out Hunger drive, through which supermarket shoppers can give $1, $2, $3 or $5 at the cash register.
 Seeking help, the food bank turned to Bruce Springsteen, a longtime supporter, to appear last weekend in a metropolitan-area newspaper ad campaign with the theme ''We Can't Let This Bank Fail!''
 At the Newark Museum, two corporate donors have stepped back from the plate. One reduced its grant, while the other ''temporarily eliminated'' a gift, said Mary Sue Sweeney Price, the museum's director.
 ''This is not a time for the faint of heart,'' Mrs. Price said. The museum announced a $235 million expansion in 2007 and is making plans for a ball in May to celebrate its 100th anniversary. ''We will manage very carefully, and recalibrate if need be.''
 Some nonprofit organizations are reporting business as normal. The Wall Street meltdown wiped out only one corporate pledge at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, and two banks are about to announce substantial new gifts, according to Lawrence P. Goldman, the center's president. 
 The American Cancer Society's Eastern Division also said donations were holding steady. Its ''Making Strides Against Breast Cancer'' campaign, conducted last month at eight state sites, raised more money than last year's, said Kris Krim, the organization's chief operating officer. 
 At the Make-A-Wish Foundation in Union, 2007 fund-raising was so robust that its president, Tom Weatherall, said, ''We gave away more wishes'' to children with life-threatening illnesses than ever. Nonetheless, he said, he is beefing up marketing and public relations and setting up a bequest office.
 The executive director of Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of Newark, Allan J. Daul, knows that many of its annual donors are feeling pinched. But Mr. Daul said he had faith that they would give anyway.
 ''My experience is that people in tough situations are often the most generous givers,'' he said. ''They understand what it means to live on the edge.''
 Still, if past recessions are any guide, virtually all nonprofits are threatened when the economy is poor. While charitable giving in the United States has grown 4.3 percent on average during nonrecessionary years over the past 40 years, it has fallen 1 percent during recessions, according to Patrick M. Rooney, director of research at the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University. 
 The charities least likely to suffer are religious, or those that serve basic needs like food and shelter, Mr. Rooney said. Arts groups are the most vulnerable.
 ''There are two ways to look at this,'' he said. ''One is, 'It's only 1 percent.' And that's true. But if you're used to growing over 4 percent, then that's a 5 percent drop.''
 Given the economic forecast, many charities are tweaking appeals, prospecting for new donors or postponing capital campaigns. 
 Some gave their holiday letters an urgent tone, including the New Jersey Division of the Salvation Army, which wrote, ''We need the support of our friends right now.'' Others used a softer sell. Clean Ocean Action, an environmental advocacy group in Highlands, included a check envelope, but featured supporters' stories and highlighted accomplishments rather than pleading, ''Give us your money,'' said Jennifer Smiga, its events director.
 During its September appeal, the publicly supported Newark radio station WBGO-FM encouraged listeners to pledge in installments, and lowered the monthly floor to $5. The drive kept pace with last year's, but the station is expecting reduced funding from the New Jersey Council on the Arts and other sources, WBGO executives said. 
 ''We're trying to figure out how to do more with less,'' said the station's general manager, Cephas Bowles. ''Our projections show revenue is flat or, for certain streams, down.''
 George C. Ruotolo Jr. of Creskill, who has worked as a national philanthropic consultant for the past 29 years, said some clients were feeling panicky. He said he had advised them to keep soliciting, but to expect extra scrutiny from potential donors. 
 ''People want to know: Are they cutting waste? Do they have a business plan?'' Mr. Ruotolo said. ''What might happen here is that we see some of these organizations merge with others. The ones that are strong will do well.''

HEADLINE: Our Summer of Stairs

BYLINE: By TERI KARUSH ROGERS

 BODY:
FEW things make me as restless as seeing too far ahead, which is probably why flattened suburban and exurban landscapes tend to sharpen my longing for the vertical metropolis of Manhattan. Besides getting agreeably in my way, the city's brick-and-steel stalagmites function as part inspiration, part dare: Do you have the chops to survive, let alone thrive, as a squishy midget among hulking goliaths? 
 But what if your vertical city should betray you? What if, for instance, your co-op building's only elevator is taken out of service -- for two months? And what if you happen to live on the ninth floor -- 144 steps above the Upper West Side trade route for everything you, your 10-year-old daughter and your husband depend on to survive in your suddenly breathtakingly inconvenient aerie?
 What, in other words, do you do after the cursing stops? 
 That's a trick question, incidentally: When you are a reasonably fit but distinctly nontriathlete type, the cursing never exactly stops -- it hovers in a punctuation-strewn thought bubble above your head each time you ascend the penitentiary-gray enameled fire stairs.
 And no matter how many leg lunges you performed in a futile effort to prepare for being stranded nine stories in the air while the elevator was being replaced, the thought bubble expands, along with the pain in your quadriceps and the shortness of breath, around the fifth or sixth or seventh floor. 
 Exactly which floor depends on how many weeks you've been doing this, how many trips you've made that day, how many pounds of flotsam you are lugging, whether you're making this particular journey because you forgot something, how many alcoholic beverages you have consumed, and whether the plantar fasciitis in your left heel is feeling more like a knife wound or a cramp.
 But let's start from the beginning: I was against putting in a new elevator. 
 It wasn't that I was enamored of the old one, original to our 89-year-old 36-unit building. The five-by-four-foot space was about the size of a holding pen for a large dog, with only slightly more flair. In the wake of a cheap 1980s facelift by the building's sponsor, its dark wood panels had been inscribed by a generation of undertipped delivery people, its black laminate trim looked gnawed and listless, and the application of polish to the brass around the door only accentuated the slings and arrows inflicted by countless headboards, refrigerators and armoires.
 Also, the elevator was not only agonizingly slow -- it was painfully stupid. Summoned by a single nondirectional call button on each floor, it was unable to assess whether the caller wanted to go up or down. Heading heavenward, it would attempt to collect everyone aiming for earth. And when I left my apartment on the second-to-highest floor, I was frequently greeted by the tight smiles of neighbors conscripted from below.
 Which brings me to one of several points in the elevator's favor: A shared misery that brought residents together in close quarters at frequent and tedious intervals, it functioned as a major social artery. 
 Second, our humble lift embodied the relaxed, unfussy, we-ain't-no-full-service-condo vibe of our building. Along with our lack of a doorman, it suggested to buyers with grander expectations that they might be happier elsewhere.
 Third, and most critically in my view, the elevator worked fine. During my five years in the building, I had had to climb the stairs only once. It seemed like an act of minor urban heroics at the time, and I was in no hurry to repeat the experience daily for two months, nor to pay an assessment for the privilege.
 When the project was first broached several years ago, many residents agreed with me. Engineering reports showed that there was nothing wrong with the elevator and that although it had exceeded its expected life, it might yet outlive us all. 
 But one ugly hitch eventually tipped the vote: If the ancient drum machine broke or cracked, the Department of Buildings would shut down the elevator, forcing us to replace the entire unit without warning. Lacking proper lead time, we could be hoofing it for six or eight months instead of two. 
 The board voted early this year to proceed, with work scheduled to begin on July 28 and end eight weeks later. The project would cost about $228,000, including around $12,000 in overtime. (We would save two weeks by paying the contractor overtime to work 60 hours per week instead of 40.) 
 In addition, our contractor agreed to a penalty of $1,000 for every day the project finished behind schedule. Our reserve fund covered $75,000 of the cost, and for the remainder, shareholders were assessed $153,000, paid over 24 months. My husband and I were assessed $5,352, or an extra $223 per month on our maintenance bill for two years. 
 Reacting to the news of my impending ordeal, friends and acquaintances lurched from stunned silence to rah-rah exclamations. These usually took the form of, ''You're going to be in such great shape!'' -- which sounded a lot like complimenting a dying patient on her bathrobe.
 Several residents, for whom trawling the stairs would have been an extreme physical hardship, arranged to move in with friends or family or to retreat to a weekend home. But a combination of denial, apathy, thrift or (sigh) a lower-floor location marooned the rest of us. (In case you are wondering, as I did, boards have no legal responsibility to provide alternative housing.)
 I knew that in some ways, my family and I were among the fortunate. Unlike the four families in our building with infants or toddlers, we had a fully ambulatory 10-year-old. And owning a washer-dryer meant we wouldn't have to lug our laundry to and from the basement. 
 On the other hand, we live on the ninth floor -- high prewar floors, mind you. And because I not only work from home but do most of the foraging, as well as the child-related drop-offs and pickups, my personal suffering was likely to fall on the higher side of average.
 I was pretty sure that I could haul myself up and down, however miserably, but I had no such illusions about the half-dozen bags of groceries I buy each week at Fairway.
 The board's response to the residents' heavy-lifting needs was to hire two high school students as part-time porters, while our live-in super continued with his regular duties. Radoslov and Nicholas were sturdily built 17-year-olds who shared a useful disregard for the long-term health of their vertebrae.
 The building also established a temporary stroller-parking zone in the lobby. Trash and recycling bins appeared on every floor at one set of fire stairs, cutting down on the need to trek to the basement. The other fire stairs, which have windows facing an airshaft, were rigged with window fans that, in theory, improved the air circulation for us climbers, though it was hard to tell, what with the constant sweating. 
 My own readiness plan, besides the leg lunges, included replacing two aging air-conditioners, lest they give up the ghost in high summer while the elevator was out of commission. I also prepared and froze some seasonally inappropriate lasagna for mealtime emergencies, and filled the wine refrigerator.
 What I remember most about Week 1 was how preposterous it felt. Going downstairs was easy, if monotonous; eight steps and turn, eight steps and turn, eight steps and turn, down and down the rabbit hole. But trudging up, amid the pain and vertigo and leering placards of progress (fourth floor, suckah!! Not even halfway!), I mostly thought some variation of ''You've got to be kidding me.'' (Now that I consider it, this wasn't far from what I was thinking when I delivered my daughter.)
 As the shock faded, I didn't get any happier, but I grew to respect the relentlessness of the challenge, the awful immutability of the stairs. They were always there. They could not be overcome through charm, intimidation or lucky breaks. I couldn't have someone climb them for me, nor could I opt out (as at the gym) because I had a headache or a deadline or a sick child.
 The stairs were a nonnegotiable, no-excuses fact of life. (Why do I climb the mountain? Because it's there. Plus, I have to go to the bathroom.)
 Nick the porter, who made about five trips each shift to the 10th floor, and many more to points in between, said his secret was to take breaks on the way up rather than to try to get it over with as fast as possible. So my husband was puzzled as to why I, a sidewalk meanderer, took to tearing ahead of him and my daughter, leaving two or three flights between us along with (according to our daughter) the bitter scent of betrayal. 
 ''I just want to get it over with as fast as possible,'' I said.
 In the outside world, there were indications that we were growing stronger. The subway stairs, for instance, failed to quicken my heart. Meanwhile, my daughter's leaps and passes drew the praise of her dance instructor. She vowed to take the stairs three times a week even after we got the elevator back. 
 As we settled into the routine, my whining to outsiders began to resemble bragging. 
 ''Can you give me a shopping bag I can carry over my shoulder?'' I would ask the Pottery Barn clerk in a bored voice. ''I have to bring this stuff up nine flights of stairs.'' 
 Understandably, we didn't have many visitors during this period. Those who came usually had a financial incentive, and we grew accustomed to greeting our panting arrivals with a glass of ice water. 
 Still, over all, our lives changed less than we had feared. 
 The work, for instance, was surprisingly unobtrusive: After the demolition of the first week, which spilled into the lobby, it seemed to consist mostly of two or three guys working quietly in the basement.
 Meanwhile, I read the newspaper online, balancing a cereal bowl on my lap, while the hard copy languished in the lobby.
 And while the rest of the country cut down on car trips to save gas, we economized on trips outside, trying to connect as many dots as possible each time. I averaged two or three a day; my husband and daughter frequently racked up just one.
 When we went on vacation for two weeks, we packed the night before so that the porter could take our bags downstairs to the super's apartment, where we retrieved them on our way out at 5 the next morning. 
 If only grocery shopping could have been so tidily arranged. Coordinating delivery windows to porter schedules proved especially challenging in September, when Rad and Nick went back to school and their hours were reduced. 
 Unaware, I ended up hastily negotiating with a Fairway deliveryman over the intercom, offering him $20 to take the bags upstairs. 
 A week later, I scheduled a Fresh Direct delivery between 8 and 10 p.m., somehow overlooking the fact that the porter would be leaving at 9. A frantic 8:15 call to the dispatcher elicited a promise that the delivery would be made by 9. It arrived at 9:06. Although the deliveryman was willing to brave the stairs for an additional $20, the driver said no. 
 My husband dragged himself downstairs to sort things out. Words were exchanged instead of gratuities, and our refrigerated items wound up spending the night in a first-floor neighbor's kitchen. Perhaps to banish a feeling of helplessness, my husband decided -- bad back and all -- to carry up three other boxes rather than wait for the porter. He staggered through our doorway like a guy who had taken a bullet in his back in a shootout.
 In the second week of September, tantalizing things started to happen with the elevator. The LED displays installed on each floor sprang to life and actually showed what floor the elevator was on. 
 Soon afterward, I had my first glimpse of the new, partially finished cab: with its rum-cherry raised wood paneling, satin-finish bronze and warm halogen halo, it reminded me of a jewel box.
 I was instantly smitten. I realized I'd been focusing so much on how to survive its installation that I hadn't understood what a vast improvement the new elevator would be. It was sort of like those dreams where you discover an extra room in your apartment.
 On Sept. 24, on schedule and without fanfare, the new elevator officially entered service. It had somehow come out smaller than advertised, true. But six weeks later I am still shocked by how much I love it, how it continues to feel like a cross between a limousine and the Chunnel, how ridiculously thrilled I am to step onto the marbled limestone floor and be whooshed away at the touch of a tasteful button.
 If there is a negative, it is that our gilded cage can be a little lonely: It is so smart and fast that I almost never ride with neighbors anymore, and when I do, there is time only for a quick hello.
 ''So what?'' my husband said. ''You know everyone anyway. Maybe they're relieved they don't have to make small talk with you anymore.''
 Maybe. And anyway, who cares about the social price of progress when we can go from one to nine faster than our brand-new puppy can pee on the floor?

HEADLINE: India Calling

BYLINE: By ANAND GIRIDHARADAS

DATELINE: VERLA, India 

 BODY:
 ''WHAT are Papa and I doing here?'' 
 These words, instant-messaged by my mother in a suburb of Washington, D.C., whizzed through the deep-ocean cables and came to me in the village where I'm now living, in the country that she left. 
 It was five years ago that I left America to come live and work in India. Now, in our family and among our Indian-American friends, other children of immigrants are exploring motherland opportunities. As economies convulse in the West and jobs dry up, the idea is spreading virally in emigre homes. 
 Which raises a heart-stirring question: If our parents left India and trudged westward for us, if they manufactured from scratch a new life there for us, if they slogged, saved, sacrificed to make our lives lighter than theirs, then what does it mean when we choose to migrate to the place they forsook? 
 If we are here, what are they doing there? 
 They came of age in the 1970s, when the ''there'' seemed paved with possibility and the ''here'' seemed paved with potholes. As a young trainee, my father felt frustrated in companies that awarded roles based on age, not achievement. He looked at his bosses, 20 years ahead of him in line, and concluded that he didn't want to spend his life becoming them. 
 My parents married in India and then embarked to America on a lonely, thrilling adventure. They learned together to drive, shop in malls, paint a house. They decided who and how to be. They kept reinventing themselves, discarding the invention, starting anew. My father became a management consultant, an entrepreneur, a human-resources executive, then a Ph.D. candidate. My mother began as a homemaker, learned ceramics, became a ceramics teacher and then the head of the art department at one of Washington's best schools. 
 It was extraordinary, and ordinary: This is what America did to people, what it always has done. 
 My parents brought us to India every few years as children. I relished time with relatives; but India always felt alien, impenetrable, frozen. 
 Perhaps it was the survivalism born of scarcity: the fierce pushing to get off the plane, the miserliness even of the rich, the obsession with doctors and engineers and the neglect of all others. Perhaps it was the bureaucracy, the need to know someone to do anything. Or the culture shock of servitude: a child's horror at reading ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' in an American middle school, then seeing servants slapped and degraded in India. 
 My firsthand impression of India seemed to confirm the rearview immigrant myth of it: a land of impossibilities. But history bends and swerves, and sometimes swivels fully around.
 India, having fruitlessly pursued command economics, tried something new: It liberalized, privatized, globalized. The economy boomed, and hope began to course through towns and villages shackled by fatalism and low expectations. 
 America, meanwhile, floundered. In a blink of history came 9/11, outsourcing, Afghanistan, Iraq, Katrina, rising economies, rogue nuclear nations, climate change, dwindling oil, a financial crisis. 
 Pessimism crept into the sunniest nation. A vast majority saw America going astray. Books heralded a ''Post-American World.'' Even in the wake of a historic presidential election, culminating in a dramatic change in direction, it remained unclear whether the United States could be delivered from its woes any time soon. 
 ''In the U.S., there's a crisis of confidence,'' said Nandan Nilekani, co-chairman of Infosys Technologies, the Indian software giant. ''In India,'' he added, ''for the first time after decades or centuries, there is a sense of optimism about the future, a sense that our children's futures can be better than ours if we try hard enough.'' 
 My love for the country of my birth has never flickered. But these new times piqued interest in my ancestral land. Many of us, the stepchildren of India, felt its change of spirit, felt the gravitational force of condensed hope. And we came. 
 Exact data on emigres working in India or spending more time here are scarce. But this is one indicator: India unveiled an Overseas Citizen of India card in 2006, offering foreign citizens of Indian origin visa-free entry for life and making it easier to work in the country. By this July, more than 280,000 emigres had signed up, according to The Economic Times, a business daily, including 120,000 from the United States.
 At first we felt confused by India's formalities and hierarchies, by British phraseology even the British had jettisoned, by the ubiquity of acronyms. We wondered what newspapers meant when they said, ''INSAT-4CR in orbit, DTH to get a boost.'' (Apparently, it meant a satellite would soon beam direct-to-home television signals.) 
 Working in offices, some of us were perplexed to be invited to ''S&M conferences,'' only to discover that this denoted sales and marketing. Several found to their chagrin that it is acceptable for another man to touch your inner thigh when you crack a joke in a meeting. 
 We learned new expressions: ''He is on tour'' (Means: He is traveling. Doesn't mean: He has joined U2.); ''What is your native place?'' (Means: Where did your ancestors live? Doesn't mean: What hospital delivered you?); ''Two minutes'' (Means: An hour. Doesn't mean: Two minutes.). 
 We tried to reinvent ourselves, as our parents had, but in reverse. Some studied Hindi, others yoga. Some visited the Ganges to find themselves; others tried days-long meditations. 
 Many of us who shunned Indian clothes in youth began wearing kurtas and chappals, saris and churidars. There was a sad truth in this: We had waited for our heritage to become cool to the world before we draped its colors and textures on our own backs. 
 We learned how to make friends here, and that it requires befriending families. We learned to love here: Men found fondness for the elusive Indian woman; women surprised themselves in succumbing to chauvinistic, mother-spoiled men. 
 We forged dual-use accents. We spoke in foreign accents by default. But when it came to arguing with accountants or ordering takeout kebabs, we went sing-song Indian. 
 We gravitated to work specially suited to us. If there is a creative class, in Richard Florida's phrase, there is also emerging what might be called a fusion class: people positioned to mediate among the multiple societies that claim them. 
 India's second-generation returnees have built boutiques that fuse Indian fabrics with Western cuts, founded companies that train a generation to work in Western companies, become dealmakers in investment firms that speak equally to Wall Street and Dalal Street, mixed albums that combine throbbing tabla with Western melodies. 
 Our parents' generation helped India from afar. They sent money, advised charities, guided hedge-fund dollars into the Bombay Stock Exchange. But most were too implicated in India to return. Our generation, unscathed by it, was freer to embrace it. 
 Countries like India once fretted about a ''brain drain.'' We are learning now that ''brain circulation,'' as some call it, may be more apt. 
 India did not export brains; it invested them. It sent millions away. In the freedom of new soil, they flowered. They seeded a new generation that, having blossomed, did what humans have always done: chase the frontier of the future. 
 Which just happened, for many of us, to be the frontier of our own pasts.

HEADLINE: The Bigger Houses Are, The Harder Prices Fall

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: GREENWICH, Conn. 

 BODY:
 Like cars in Detroit or chili in Texas, homes in Greenwich play various roles. Not just a dwelling, not just a way to keep score, houses -- particularly the Versailles-like backcountry mansions in either their traditional or neo-monstrosity incarnations -- are like an art form: critiqued, analyzed, psychoanalyzed, the way people in Manhattan used to obsess about, say, French New Wave cinema.
 So as the world sinks, and alas, even mighty Greenwich sinks with it, the talk even more than usual these days is about houses. 
 Sometimes, there's a nostalgic blast from the past, like the news last week about a local hedge fund magnate's latest proposal before the Planning and Zoning Commission. It turns out that there's at least one titan of finance left for whom that 35,084-square-foot house with indoor swimming pool and basketball court, guesthouse, ice rink with Zamboni, guardhouse and the rest isn't quite enough. So Steven Cohen, who runs the hedge fund firm S.A.C. Capital Advisors, has applied to enlarge his by just a smidge in the form of 1,144 square feet of additions for storage, a garden room, a breakfast room and an expansion of the ''his'' dressing room.
 Even in Greenwich, a 35,084-square-foot house is considered pretty good-size. It's bigger than a 27,000-square-foot house proposed by a Russian millionaire, with 26 toilets and room to park 12 cars, that was rejected this year. It's not quite as big as a proposed 39,000-square-foot house that was rejected a few years back or the biggest one that's been approved, a cozy 39,000-square-foot nook on Cowdray Park Drive. (There are five houses here larger than 35,000 square feet.)
 That said, the addition to Chez Cohen feels about as representative of the current moment as the 14,000 Dow. ''Real Estate Market Sinks in Greenwich,'' read the headline in the Real Estate section of Friday's Greenwich Time, usually a reliable source of upbeat market news. 
 These days, a ''once-in-a-lifetime'' $19 million estate merits only a quarter-page ad. Sometimes, along with the reverential tones, there is something of a jarring Crazy Eddie note. As the ad for the Tudor with five bedrooms, five fireplaces, five full baths and three half baths (plus staff quarters!) reads: ''At $2,900,000 this romantic 1920s estate (flanked by two gated entrances) is being 'given away!' '' 
 Increasingly, people are coming to see that some of these prices really were insane. Chris Fountain, a local real estate agent whose blog, christopherfountain.wordpress.com, keeps a jaundiced eye on the market, figures there are at least 88 spec houses on the market in the Greenwich area, 53 of them listed for more than $5 million. 
 Total sales fell by a third more than a year ago, most of them before the carnage on Wall Street began in earnest.
 ''In October, nine single-family houses went to contract. Last year there were 33, and that's not a great year. Basically, nothing's selling,'' Mr. Fountain said. That's not much business for about 1,000 real estate agents.
 HE knows of one house that was listed at $28 million and sold for $13.75 million, and says that it is becoming increasingly common for large houses to sell for 30 percent off the initial asking price.
 And there is something a little surreal in the mix of stratospheric Greenwich real estate and distress-sale atmospherics. So, for instance, there's a brand new stone-and-shingle seven-bedroom ''evergreen lodge'' that was originally listed for $9.975 million and is now offered for $6.795 million. The door's open. Leaves have blown into a hallway. There's a water-shutoff notice on the door. A trash-hauling bin is outside, but it looks as if construction halted months ago, with the interior 90 percent finished. 
 ''Unless there's interest, it's silly to continue,'' said Janet Silver, who is listed as the agent for the house and is a part owner. ''We started when the market was hot, and it's a great location, but it takes a long time to build a 13,000-square-foot house, and we just missed the market. If someone's interested, we're obviously happy to hear any and all offers.'' 
 Worse, as noted on Mr. Fountain's blog, is a house on Round Hill Road, one of Greenwich's premier addresses, where construction has long since stopped. The developer pleaded guilty to mortgage and insurance fraud, and some lender is on the hook for $6.2 million for a shell that will probably have to be torn down. 
 And it might not be the only one.
 Bad times won't last forever. Greenwich has seen tough real estate markets before, and it's an item of faith in town that Greenwich is the last market to go down and the first to come back.
 But leaving aside how many Wall Street zillionaires there will be in the future, more than a few people are wondering about the marketability of all those megahouses, sitting like Hummers on blocks, even when the economy comes back.
 ''Any of the old-timers will tell you that after every boom-and-bust period, tastes in what people want change dramatically,'' said Frank Farricker, a member of the Planning and Zoning Commission. ''So you have a lot of these 15,000-square-foot spec houses with add-ons like 10,000-bottle wine cellars and indoor swimming pools and screening rooms. You wonder if that's going to be so evocative of 2008 that when we come out of this, someone looking for a house will see that and say, 'Nah, not interested.' ''
 He added: ''Maybe they'll want to say, 'Look at me, I've got full solar and geothermal heating.' I'm pretty positive the next status symbol may be a big house with a zero carbon footprint.''

HEADLINE: Soil-Free Farming, As Practiced on Board

BYLINE: By JULI S. CHARKES

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
 THE morning's briefing on gardening covered some familiar hallmarks: the longevity of tomatoes, the bountiful nature of cucumbers. But other aspects of the tutorial were less familiar: how to efficiently flush out water tanks, the wisdom of having a spare water pump on hand for flooding emergencies. 
 The future of farming may have less to do with arable land than a familiarity with hydroponics, at least on the Science Barge, an agricultural system on a 135-foot-long barge powered by the sun, wind and biofuels. The barge made its permanent home in Yonkers beginning last Monday and will be open to the public in December as part of a holiday event and then permanently in the spring. 
 ''It's demonstrating how you can grow food in an energy-efficient and sustainable way -- it's a whole new form of urban farming,'' said Rick Magder, executive director of Groundwork Hudson Valley, a nonprofit environmental advocacy group in Yonkers that acquired the barge last month and will oversee its operation from the Yonkers waterfront.
 The barge is intended to function as an educational lab for both schoolchildren in the New York City area and adults interested in learning about the technologies onboard: solar panels power the pumps and fans in the greenhouse, for example, and recirculated rainwater irrigates the plants. 
 The Groundwork staff underwent training on board the barge before its move from Chelsea Piers in Manhattan. On a blustery morning earlier this month, members gathered on the deck to learn about the variety of produce that the barge has yielded during its two-year lifespan: tomatoes, bell peppers, melons, eggplants, lettuce and vines of strawberries that curled around baskets hanging in an onboard greenhouse.
 All of that bounty was grown without pesticides, part of a hydroponic system in which plants grow in water without using soil.
 The barge also features some aquaponic techniques, which rely on the natural give and take between creatures and plants. The water nourishing rows of fragrant basil plants, for example, contained waste products from tilapia fish that live onboard, said Jennifer Nelkin, greenhouse director for New York Sun Works, which created the barge and oversaw its operation for the past two years. 
 Ted Caplow, who is the executive director of New York Sun Works and designed the barge, said its goal was to help transform farming from its sprawling rural heritage into a sustainable urban form that might serve as a model for small spaces where fertile soil is hard to come by, like rooftops. 
 The barge uses recycled rain for irrigation and generates no waste. There are no carbon emissions thanks to the solar panels, wind turbines and biodiesel oil culled from used vegetable oil that power the barge, Mr. Caplow said.
 ''It's a living science lab that on its first level is a demonstration of how we can grow food with fewer resources and that we can produce what we need without damaging the world around us,'' Mr. Caplow said.
 THE barge will cost a minimum of $200,000 a year to operate, Mr. Magder said.
 But the opportunity to promote the environmental technologies for children and adults -- 6,000 children and 12,000 adults visited the barge in New York -- persuaded Groundwork to sign on as the new owner despite the troubled economy, Mr. Magder said. ''We thought this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' he said.
 Mr. Magder said he hoped to do fund-raising from local businesses to cover operating costs; the barge was donated to Groundwork for $2. The City of Yonkers has committed a one-time payment of $50,000 to the operation, he said. 
 Chuck Lesnick, the City Council president, said the barge would support Yonkers's commitment to the environment and be an important tourist attraction in the revitalized downtown area and waterfront.
 ''Anytime you can bring people to the waterfront,'' he said, ''that's good for Yonkers.''

HEADLINE: High School Dances Shine Just a Little Less Brightly

BYLINE: By YOLANNE ALMANZAR

DATELINE: MIAMI 

 BODY:
The party this year feels different to Yeney Perez, a high school student here. A smaller venue. More expensive tickets. And fewer people.
 ''It doesn't feel like homecoming,'' said Yeney, a 17-year-old senior.
 From affluent neighborhoods to blue-collar ones, the homecoming dance is a more-modest affair this year. 
 In Miami-Dade County, a survey of local high schools revealed that ticket sales decreased by a third from last year. 
 School activities directors like Angela Lima requested the survey to help plan for the prom. Ms. Lima said the troubled economy was to blame for the decline in ticket sales.
 ''My numbers were nowhere near where they were last year,'' she said.
 Financing for these school-sponsored activities has traditionally been generated through a variety of sources, including regular budget allocations, fund-raising events and revenue from vending machines. With shrinking budgets and a trend away from vending machines, schools have been struggling.
 Mel Riddile, a school administrator for four decades and the associate director for high school services at the National Association of Secondary School Principals, said cuts in student activities were occurring around the country, with impoverished neighborhoods feeling it the most.
 ''It's going to be deeper in those schools that already have had poverty,'' Mr. Riddile said, ''but it's going to be felt more broadly across the spectrum of schools because the problem is more widespread.'' 
 Palmetto Senior High School had one of the pricier dances. At $50 a ticket, the dance was at the Hilton Hotel in downtown Miami. Crystal chandeliers sparkled over the dance floor, and dinner was served with gold-colored napkins. While some girls wore dresses found in department stores, others wore upscale designs from Betsey Johnson or BCBG.
 Hyun-Woo Lim, 17, had a budget of $300 for her dress. She knows that the economy is not doing well because she no longer gets her allowance of $50 a week.
 ''My mom said that we have to live more frugal,'' she said. ''Since I don't have an allowance, I don't go shopping with my friends.''
 Chelsea Rogers, 17, has been thinking about her allowance, too. Her mother is a car saleswoman, and at the beginning of the summer, she posted a chart of how much money is spent every month in their home. The list shows all the bills that need to be paid and extra money budgeted for family members to spend. Chelsea is given $150 a month, but instead of using it, she made extra money baby-sitting to offset the costs of her dance ticket.
 ''I actually came up with my own money, so I could go to homecoming,'' she said. 
 At Hialeah Senior High School, students handled decorations themselves to cut expenses.
 Louis Gonzalez, 17, was organizing centerpieces at the Miami Mart Airport Hotel ballroom and said he was saving in a big way: he was going to the dance alone.
 ''A date is expensive,'' he said with a chuckle.
 Nancy Rich, an activities coordinator, watched from a corner, counting the students who still owed money. Some students have put themselves on a list to pay for the ticket at the door. 
 ''This is our profit,'' she said, circling about 35 students who had promised to pay once their parents had given them the money.
 Ms. Rich said the bulk of money for student government's budget came from talent shows and the homecoming dance. But this year, they just want to break even.
 She said certain costs could not be avoided, like security and the music. In years past, staff members who volunteered would be paid, but not anymore. 
 Yeney Perez is part of the student government, and she spent all week going classroom to classroom trying to get people excited about homecoming activities. Most said they just did not have the money. The expected turnout for the dance shrank from 600 students a few weeks ago to 400. And that compares with 900 students in previous years.
 Yeney Perez said she was worried how the limited profits this year would affect student government and its ability to finance events for other clubs.
 ''When we don't have money to provide them, it limits the activities in schools and that has an effect on school spirit,'' she said. 
 Ms. Rich said the school would have to create a new fund-raiser this year to offset the losses from homecoming. But at least for one night, she said, she would not worry about money and would focus on the students having a good time.
 ''When times are bad, this is when they need it most,'' Ms. Rich said. ''Something in their lives that they can look forward to every year.''

HEADLINE: New Fears Arise in Michigan, Where the Hard Times Started Years Ago

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY and MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
FENNVILLE, Mich. -- The bad news keeps coming to Michigan, a state long stuck in recession and at ground zero in the national economic downturn. But unlike in months and years past, there are no exceptions to the despair, not even here among the bucolic resort communities along Lake Michigan.
The flailing auto industry is important here, but so is furniture building, tourism, the retail trade and construction -- pieces of the economy long buffered from the downturn in Detroit. Now waves of layoffs are sweeping towns around here in wine country and elsewhere across the state, swelling the ranks of the unemployed just as tens of thousands of those already of out of work fear running out of unemployment benefits.
''You just sit and you worry,'' said Pat Weber, a construction administrator in Fennville who was laid off more than a year ago. ''In the last year, I've put in for more than 100 jobs. I stopped counting after 110. It's just so defeating.'' 
All around Fennville and its neighbors here in southwest Michigan, front lawns are peppered with for-sale signs and merchants complain about slow days. But while this remains a beautiful place with none of the obvious blight of Detroit on the other side of the state, residents say the hardship beneath the surface is very real.
It is the same story in other parts of Michigan, as the state's already entrenched recession -- in at least its fifth year, according to economic experts -- digs deeper as a result of the recent global financial crisis.
New data show the state's unemployment rate crept up to 9.3 percent, almost three times what it was in 2000, and, along with Rhode Island, the highest in the country. Just last week, Herman Miller Inc., an office furniture company based in Zeeland, Mich., announced that it would eliminate or lay off 400 to 650 workers, many of them in western Michigan. SKD Automotive, an auto parts manufacturer in Jonesville, Mich., where it is the largest employer, indicated it would eliminate 300 jobs.
As a result of the steady job losses that began in the summer of 2000, 1.82 million Michigan residents, or close to 20 percent of the population, are now on some form of public assistance, including food stamps and home heating credits, a record for the state.
''It is really hard not knowing if you aren't going to be working the next day,'' said Wendy Einhardt, 47, who spent 16 years making plastic car parts before being laid off in August in Sebewaing, on Saginaw Bay of Lake Huron. ''You worry a lot about what is coming.''
Around the state, home foreclosures are commonplace, the trust fund that pays unemployment benefits is millions of dollars in debt, food banks are struggling and health agencies are reporting an uptick in people with symptoms like anxiety and depression. Suicides were up in recent years, although officials caution against drawing any direct links between deaths and the economy.
In one sign of distress, in the first nine months of this year, some 130,000 Michigan residents who had lost their jobs remained out of work so long that they ran out of regular unemployment benefits. By the middle of this month, 63,000 people (who had already run out of their ordinary maximum benefit -- as many as 26 weeks, at as much as $362 a week) also ran out of an extension authorized by Congress.
Without a second extension of benefits, signed by President Bush on Friday, tens of thousands of others had been expected to run out each month.
Sandra Peavley, 54, who lives in Warren, near Detroit, and had worked at a bank for 18 years before losing her job, ran out of unemployment last month. Ms. Peavley, who is divorced and had grown accustomed to earning more than $60,000 a year -- plus health benefits, an annual bonus and a thriving 401(k) -- said her unemployment checks were what had allowed her to stay afloat.
''There was never anything left over,'' she said, ''but it kept my household running.''
Ms. Peavley said she could not afford health insurance anymore, and had come to ration the antistress pills her doctor prescribed. She has not paid debts she owes on credit cards, and says she changed her phone number only to have creditors, to her mortification, call her neighbors, even distant relatives, trying to track her down.
''I don't have the money,'' Ms. Peavley said quietly. ''I'm out of work. What am I supposed to do?''
Back near Fennville, Kevin Charak is concerned about the future, too. He is the owner of the Sherwood Forest Bed and Breakfast in Douglas, a lakeside town known for its charm.
''Things have gotten worse in the past six months to a year,'' Mr. Charak said. ''And I'm not the first guy to feel the pain; I'm the last guy to feel the pain. The phone's just not ringing.''
Interviews in several towns with residents, elected officials and economic experts show that Michigan is straining under the weight of the prolonged hard times. And it is anxious about a future that could look even worse, particularly if any of Detroit's Big Three automakers should collapse.
''There's this feeling that we've been in the trough long before anyone got there,'' said Jane Zehnder-Merrell of the Michigan League for Human Services. ''It's been a long spiral downward since 2000, really. We've never experienced any economic recovery.''
Ms. Weber, 58, the unemployed construction administrator here, tried to sell the two-bedroom home she designed on six acres abutting a forest in the early 1990s so she could move away from Fennville to find work, but the house languished on a weak market for months and, finally, dejected, she gave up.
She is not sure how much longer she will be able to pay her mortgage. She fears the solidly middle-class life she built for herself over decades is within a whisker of disappearance.
''The worst that will happen is that I will lose my home,'' said Ms. Weber, gazing around her living room, her golden retriever at her feet.
Rick McHugh, a lawyer who focuses on Michigan for the National Employment Law Project, an advocacy group for low-wage workers, has even seen his job change. ''A year ago, I felt like I could help people, give people advice or send them to a program that would help them,'' Mr. McHugh said. ''Now, I say, 'I hope you have a relative with a house that's paid off so you'll have a place to live.' ''
Many of the state's unemployed are hoping to go back to school to be trained for technical, medical or so-called green jobs -- areas that seem to be more in demand than old-style manufacturing.
But one barrier, some experts say, is the high number -- some 1.7 million residents -- who have ''basic skill challenges,'' like poor English or no high school diploma. As far as higher education, the state ranks 35th, below the national average, in college graduates.
Some of the newly poor were homeowners not long ago. According to state figures, 7 percent of families who are foreclosed on these days end up homeless. And Michigan's foreclosure rate is among the top five nationwide, with the highest concentration in Wayne County, home to Detroit and some suburbs.
For Ms. Weber, who is far from destitute, there is no more going out for dinner and very little driving. Her grocery list is shorn of extras. She is not sure that her car, which needs costly repairs, will get her to Chicago for Thanksgiving dinner with friends. Life looks different now.
''This is so debilitating, so humiliating,'' she said. ''I feel kicked to the curb. It's been one defeat after another, seems like forever. I feel reduced to nothing.''
Gov. Jennifer M. Granholm of Michigan, a Democrat, says that her administration has made efforts to remake basic elements of state policy -- tax structure, statewide school requirements, the economy itself -- anything to turn things around. But she acknowledges the progress has been slow.
''These are all long-term strategies, I know,'' Ms. Granholm said. ''But we didn't get here overnight so we've got to do a lot of things to get out of it.''
After six years of cuts in the state's budget, more trims seem inevitable because of a shortfall this fiscal year, expected by one estimate to be $400 million.
As for more cuts, Ms. Granholm lamented, ''People are used to it now.''
State officials see Michigan as being, at least in part, the victim of a globalized economy and an automobile industry that failed to keep up with consumer demand. But others see a much broader explanation rooted in the state's inability to diversify its economy.
''We put all our chips on a poker hand called durable goods manufacturing, particularly the autos,'' said Charles L. Ballard, a professor of economics at Michigan State University. ''In the middle of the 20th century, every time we turned over the hand it was four aces, a straight flush. If you have an undiversified economy based on a sector that's booming, great.''
That is not the case anymore.
In fact, more than half of the people employed nationwide by the Big Three automakers live in Michigan. And together, their market share has plummeted 30 percentage points to something approaching 44 percent of the overall auto market in the last 13 years. It has had a ripple effect across the state.
Steve Landaal, the president of Landaal Packaging Systems in Burton, Mich., said he had no choice but to begin a painful string of layoffs of his employees in April. In the end, nearly 70 have been laid off from the company's packaging division, which once had 250 employees boxing and distributing products -- plenty of them General Motors car parts.
''The hardest thing in my job I've ever had to do is lay people off,'' Mr. Landaal said. ''At this point, around here, finding a job is like getting blood out of a stone.''
Susan Saulny reported from Fennville, and Monica Davey from Lansing.

HEADLINE: Citigroup Pays for a Rush to Risk

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH and JULIE CRESWELL

 BODY:
''Our job is to set a tone at the top to incent people to do the right thing and to set up safety nets to catch people who make mistakes or do the wrong thing and correct those as quickly as possible. And it is working. It is working.''
 Charles O. Prince III, Citigroup's chief executive, in 2006
 In September 2007, with Wall Street confronting a crisis caused by too many souring mortgages, Citigroup executives gathered in a wood-paneled library to assess their own well-being. 
 There, Citigroup's chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, learned for the first time that the bank owned about $43 billion in mortgage-related assets. He asked Thomas G. Maheras, who oversaw trading at the bank, whether everything was O.K.
 Mr. Maheras told his boss that no big losses were looming, according to people briefed on the meeting who would speak only on the condition that they not be named.
 For months, Mr. Maheras's reassurances to others at Citigroup had quieted internal concerns about the bank's vulnerabilities. But this time, a risk-management team was dispatched to more rigorously examine Citigroup's huge mortgage-related holdings. They were too late, however: within several weeks, Citigroup would announce billions of dollars in losses.
 Normally, a big bank would never allow the word of just one executive to carry so much weight. Instead, it would have its risk managers aggressively look over any shoulder and guard against trading or lending excesses. 
 But many Citigroup insiders say the bank's risk managers never investigated deeply enough. Because of longstanding ties that clouded their judgment, the very people charged with overseeing deal makers eager to increase short-term earnings -- and executives' multimillion-dollar bonuses -- failed to rein them in, these insiders say.
 Today, Citigroup, once the nation's largest and mightiest financial institution, has been brought to its knees by more than $65 billion in losses, write-downs for troubled assets and charges to account for future losses. More than half of that amount stems from mortgage-related securities created by Mr. Maheras's team -- the same products Mr. Prince was briefed on during that 2007 meeting.
 Citigroup's stock has plummeted to its lowest price in more than a decade, closing Friday at $3.77. At that price the company is worth just $20.5 billion, down from $244 billion two years ago. Waves of layoffs have accompanied that slide, with about 75,000 jobs already gone or set to disappear from a work force that numbered about 375,000 a year ago.
 Burdened by the losses and a crisis of confidence, Citigroup's future is so uncertain that regulators in New York and Washington held a series of emergency meetings late last week to discuss ways to help the bank right itself.
 And as the credit crisis appears to be entering another treacherous phase despite a $700 billion federal bailout, Citigroup's woes are emblematic of the haphazard management and rush to riches that enveloped all of Wall Street. All across the banking business, easy profits and a booming housing market led many prominent financiers to overlook the dangers they courted.
 While much of the damage inflicted on Citigroup and the broader economy was caused by errant, high-octane trading and lax oversight, critics say, blame also reaches into the highest levels at the bank. Earlier this year, the Federal Reserve took the bank to task for poor oversight and risk controls in a report it sent to Citigroup.
 The bank's downfall was years in the making and involved many in its hierarchy, particularly Mr. Prince and Robert E. Rubin, an influential director and senior adviser.
 Citigroup insiders and analysts say that Mr. Prince and Mr. Rubin played pivotal roles in the bank's current woes, by drafting and blessing a strategy that involved taking greater trading risks to expand its business and reap higher profits. Mr. Prince and Mr. Rubin both declined to comment for this article.
 When he was Treasury secretary during the Clinton administration, Mr. Rubin helped loosen Depression-era banking regulations that made the creation of Citigroup possible by allowing banks to expand far beyond their traditional role as lenders and permitting them to profit from a variety of financial activities. During the same period he helped beat back tighter oversight of exotic financial products, a development he had previously said he was helpless to prevent. 
 And since joining Citigroup in 1999 as a trusted adviser to the bank's senior executives, Mr. Rubin, who is an economic adviser on the transition team of President-elect Barack Obama, has sat atop a bank that has been roiled by one financial miscue after another.
 Citigroup was ensnared in murky financial dealings with the defunct energy company Enron, which drew the attention of federal investigators; it was criticized by law enforcement officials for the role one of its prominent research analysts played during the telecom bubble several years ago; and it found itself in the middle of regulatory violations in Britain and Japan.
 For a time, Citigroup's megabank model paid off handsomely, as it rang up billions in earnings each quarter from credit cards, mortgages, merger advice and trading. 
 But when Citigroup's trading machine began churning out billions of dollars in mortgage-related securities, it courted disaster. As it built up that business, it used accounting maneuvers to move billions of dollars of the troubled assets off its books, freeing capital so the bank could grow even larger. Because of pending accounting changes, Citigroup and other banks have been bringing those assets back in-house, raising concerns about a new round of potential losses.
 To some, the misery at Citigroup is no surprise. Lynn Turner, a former chief accountant with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said the bank's balkanized culture and pell-mell management made problems inevitable.
 ''If you're an entity of this size,'' he said, ''if you don't have controls, if you don't have the right culture and you don't have people accountable for the risks that they are taking, you're Citigroup.'' 
 Questions on Oversight
 Though they carry less prestige and are paid less than Wall Street traders and bankers, risk managers can wield significant clout. Their job is to monitor trading floors and inquire about how a bank's money is being invested, so they can head off potential problems before blow-ups occur. Though risk managers and traders work side by side, they can have an uncomfortable coexistence because the monitors can put a brake on trading. 
 That is the way it works in theory. But at Citigroup, many say, it was a bit different.
 David C. Bushnell was the senior risk officer who, with help from his staff, was supposed to keep an eye on the bank's bond trading business and its multibillion-dollar portfolio of mortgage-backed securities. Those activities were part of what the bank called its fixed-income business, which Mr. Maheras supervised. 
 One of Mr. Maheras's trusted deputies, Randolph H. Barker, helped oversee the huge build-up in mortgage-related securities at Citigroup. But Mr. Bushnell, Mr. Maheras and Mr. Barker were all old friends, having climbed the bank's corporate ladder together.
 It was common in the bank to see Mr. Bushnell waiting patiently -- sometimes as long as 45 minutes -- outside Mr. Barker's office so he could drive him home to Short Hills, N.J., where both of their families lived. The two men took occasional fly-fishing trips together; one expedition left them stuck on a lake after their boat ran out of gas.
 Because Mr. Bushnell had to monitor traders working for Mr. Barker's bond desk, their friendship raised eyebrows inside the company among those concerned about its controls. 
 After all, traders' livelihoods depended on finding new ways to make money, sometimes using methods that might not be in the bank's long-term interests. But insufficient boundaries were established in the bank's fixed-income unit to limit potential conflicts of interest involving Mr. Bushnell and Mr. Barker, people inside the bank say.
 Indeed, some at Citigroup say that if traders or bankers wanted to complete a potentially profitable deal, they could sometimes rely on Mr. Barker to convince Mr. Bushnell that it was a risk worth taking.
 Risk management ''has to be independent, and it wasn't independent at Citigroup, at least when it came to fixed income,'' said one former executive in Mr. Barker's group who, like many other people interviewed for this article, insisted on anonymity because of pending litigation against the bank or to retain close ties to their colleagues. ''We used to say that if we wanted to get a deal done, we needed to convince Randy first because he could get it through.'' 
 Others say that Mr. Bushnell's friendship with Mr. Maheras may have presented a similar blind spot.
 ''Because he has such trust and faith in these guys he has worked with for years, he didn't ask the right questions,'' a former senior Citigroup executive said, referring to Mr. Bushnell. 
 Mr. Bushnell and Mr. Barker did not return repeated phone calls seeking comment. Mr. Maheras declined to comment.
 For some time after Sanford I. Weill, an architect of the merger that created Citigroup a decade ago, took control of Citigroup, he toned down the bank's bond trading. But in late 2002, Mr. Prince, who had been Mr. Weill's longtime legal counsel, was put in charge of Citigroup's corporate and investment bank.
 According to a former Citigroup executive, Mr. Prince started putting pressure on Mr. Maheras and others to increase earnings in the bank's trading operations, particularly in the creation of collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.'s -- securities that packaged mortgages and other forms of debt into bundles for resale to investors.
 Because C.D.O.'s included so many forms of bundled debt, gauging their risk was particularly tricky; some parts of the bundle could be sound, while others were vulnerable to default. 
 ''Chuck Prince going down to the corporate investment bank in late 2002 was the start of that process,'' a former Citigroup executive said of the bank's big C.D.O. push. ''Chuck was totally new to the job. He didn't know a C.D.O. from a grocery list, so he looked for someone for advice and support. That person was Rubin. And Rubin had always been an advocate of being more aggressive in the capital markets arena. He would say, 'You have to take more risk if you want to earn more.' ''
 It appeared to be a good time for building up Citigroup's C.D.O. business. As the housing market around the country took flight, the C.D.O. market also grew apace as more and more mortgages were pooled together into newfangled securities.
 From 2003 to 2005, Citigroup more than tripled its issuing of C.D.O.'s, to more than $20 billion from $6.28 billion, and Mr. Maheras, Mr. Barker and others on the C.D.O. team helped transform Citigroup into one of the industry's biggest players. Firms issuing the C.D.O.'s generated fees of 0.4 percent to 2.5 percent of the amount sold -- meaning Citigroup made up to $500 million in fees from the business in 2005 alone.
 Even as Citigroup's C.D.O. stake was expanding, its top executives wanted more profits from that business. Yet they were not running a bank that was up to all the challenges it faced, including properly overseeing billions of dollars' worth of exotic products, according to Citigroup insiders and regulators who later criticized the bank.
 When Mr. Prince was put in charge in 2003, he presided over a mess of warring business units and operational holes, particularly in critical areas like risk-management and controls. 
 ''He inherited a gobbledygook of companies that were never integrated, and it was never a priority of the company to invest,'' said Meredith A. Whitney, a banking analyst who was one of the company's early critics. ''The businesses didn't communicate with each other. There were dozens of technology systems and dozens of financial ledgers.''
 Problems with trading and banking oversight at Citigroup became so dire that the Federal Reserve took the unusual step of telling the bank it could make no more acquisitions until it put its house in order.
 In 2005, stung by regulatory rebukes and unable to follow Mr. Weill's penchant for expanding Citigroup's holdings through rapid-fire takeovers, Mr. Prince and his board of directors decided to push even more aggressively into trading and other business that would allow Citigroup to continue expanding the bank internally.
 One person who helped push Citigroup along this new path was Mr. Rubin.
 Pushing Growth
 Robert Rubin has moved seamlessly between Wall Street and Washington. After making his millions as a trader and an executive at Goldman Sachs, he joined the Clinton administration. 
 Mr. Weill, as Citigroup's chief, wooed Mr. Rubin to join the bank after Mr. Rubin left Washington. Mr. Weill had been involved in the financial services industry's lobbying to persuade Washington to loosen its regulatory hold on Wall Street.
 As chairman of Citigroup's executive committee, Mr. Rubin was the bank's resident sage, advising top executives and serving on the board while, he insisted repeatedly, steering clear of daily management issues.
 ''By the time I finished at Treasury, I decided I never wanted operating responsibility again,'' he said in an interview in April. Asked then whether he had made any mistakes during his tenure at Citigroup, he offered a tentative response.
 ''I've thought a lot about that,'' he said. ''I honestly don't know. In hindsight, there are a lot of things we'd do differently. But in the context of the facts as I knew them and my role, I'm inclined to think probably not.''
 Besides, he said, it was impossible to get a complete handle on Citigroup's vulnerabilities unless you dealt with the trades daily.
 ''There is no way you would know what was going on with a risk book unless you're directly involved with the trading arena,'' he said. ''We had highly experienced, highly qualified people running the operation.'' 
 But while Mr. Rubin certainly did not have direct responsibility for a Citigroup unit, he was an architect of the bank's strategy.
 In 2005, as Citigroup began its effort to expand from within, Mr. Rubin peppered his colleagues with questions as they formulated the plan. According to current and former colleagues, he believed that Citigroup was falling behind rivals like Morgan Stanley and Goldman, and he pushed to bulk up the bank's high-growth fixed-income trading, including the C.D.O. business.
 Former colleagues said Mr. Rubin also encouraged Mr. Prince to broaden the bank's appetite for risk, provided that it also upgraded oversight -- though the Federal Reserve later would conclude that the bank's oversight remained inadequate. 
 Once the strategy was outlined, Mr. Rubin helped Mr. Prince gain the board's confidence that it would work.
 After that, the bank moved even more aggressively into C.D.O.'s. It added to its trading operations and snagged crucial people from competitors. Bonuses doubled and tripled for C.D.O. traders. Mr. Barker drew pay totaling $15 million to $20 million a year, according to former colleagues, and Mr. Maheras became one of Citigroup's most highly compensated employees, earning as much as $30 million at the peak -- far more than top executives like Mr. Bushnell in the risk-management department.
 In December 2005, with Citigroup diving into the C.D.O. business, Mr. Prince assured analysts that all was well at his bank.
 ''Anything based on human endeavor and certainly any business that involves risk-taking, you're going to have problems from time to time,'' he said. ''We will run our business in a way where our credibility and our reputation as an institution with the public and with our regulators will be an asset of the company and not a liability.''
 Yet as the bank's C.D.O. machine accelerated, its risk controls fell further behind, according to former Citigroup traders, and risk managers lacked clear lines of reporting. At one point, for instance, risk managers in the fixed-income division reported to both Mr. Maheras and Mr. Bushnell -- setting up a potential conflict because that gave Mr. Maheras influence over employees who were supposed to keep an eye on his traders. 
 C.D.O.'s were complex, and even experienced managers like Mr. Maheras and Mr. Barker underestimated the risks they posed, according to people with direct knowledge of Citigroup's business. Because of that, they put blind faith in the passing grades that major credit-rating agencies bestowed on the debt. 
 While the sheer size of Citigroup's C.D.O. position caused concern among some around the trading desk, most say they kept their concerns to themselves. 
 ''I just think senior managers got addicted to the revenues and arrogant about the risks they were running,'' said one person who worked in the C.D.O. group. ''As long as you could grow revenues, you could keep your bonus growing.''
 To make matters worse, Citigroup's risk models never accounted for the possibility of a national housing downturn, this person said, and the prospect that millions of homeowners could default on their mortgages. Such a downturn did come, of course, with disastrous consequences for Citigroup and its rivals on Wall Street.
 Even as the first shock waves of the subprime mortgage crisis hit Bear Stearns in June 2007, Citigroup's top executives expressed few concerns about their bank's exposure to mortgage-linked securities. 
 In fact, when examiners from the Securities and Exchange Commission began scrutinizing Citigroup's subprime mortgage holdings after Bear Stearns's problems surfaced, the bank told them that the probability of those mortgages defaulting was so tiny that they excluded them from their risk analysis, according to a person briefed on the discussion who would speak only without being named.
 Later that summer, when the credit markets began seizing up and values of various C.D.O.'s began to plummet, Mr. Maheras, Mr. Barker and Mr. Bushnell participated in a meeting to review Citigroup's exposure.
 The slice of mortgage-related securities held by Citigroup was ''viewed by the rating agencies to have an extremely low probability of default (less than .01%),'' according to Citigroup slides used at the meeting and reviewed by The New York Times. 
 Around the same time, Mr. Maheras continued to assure his colleagues that the bank ''would never lose a penny,'' according to an executive who spoke to him. 
 In mid-September 2007, Mr. Prince convened the meeting in the small library outside his office to gauge Citigroup's exposure.
 Mr. Maheras assured the group, which included Mr. Rubin and Mr. Bushnell, that Citigroup's C.D.O. position was safe. Mr. Prince had never questioned the ballooning portfolio before this because no one, including Mr. Maheras and Mr. Bushnell, had warned him. 
 But as the subprime market plunged further, Citigroup's position became more dire -- even though the firm held onto the belief that its C.D.O.'s were safe. 
 On Oct. 1, it warned investors that it would write off $1.3 billion in subprime mortgage-related assets. But of the $43 billion in C.D.O.'s it had on its books, it wrote off only about $95 million, according to a person briefed on the situation. 
 Soon, however, C.D.O. prices began to collapse. Credit-rating agencies downgraded C.D.O.'s, threatening Citigroup's stockpile. A week later, Merrill Lynch aggressively marked down similar securities, forcing other banks to face reality.
 By early November, Citigroup's anticipated write-downs ballooned to $8 billion to $11 billion. Mr. Barker and Mr. Maheras lost their jobs, as Mr. Bushnell did later on. And on Nov. 4, Mr. Prince told the board that he, too, would resign. 
 Although Mr. Prince received no severance, he walked away with Citigroup stock valued then at $68 million -- along with a cash bonus of about $12.5 million for 2007. 
 Putting Out Fires
 Mr. Prince was replaced last December by Vikram S. Pandit, a former money manager and investment banker whom Mr. Rubin had earlier recruited in a senior role. Since becoming chief executive, Mr. Pandit has been scrambling to put out fires and repair Citigroup's deficient risk-management systems.
 Earlier this year, Federal Reserve examiners quietly presented the bank with a scathing review of its risk-management practices, according to people briefed on the situation. 
 Citigroup executives responded with a 25-page single-spaced memo outlining a sweeping overhaul of the bank's risk management. 
 In May, Brian Leach, Citigroup's new chief risk officer, told analysts that his bank had greatly improved oversight and installed several new risk managers. He said he wanted to ensure ''that Citi takes the lessons learned from recent events and makes critical enhancements to its risk management frameworks. A change in culture is required at Citi.''
 Meanwhile, regulators have criticized the banking industry as a whole for relying on outsiders -- in particular the ratings agencies -- to help them gauge the risk of their investments.
 ''There is really no excuse for institutions that specialize in credit risk assessment, like large commercial banks, to rely solely on credit ratings in assessing credit risk,'' John C. Dugan, the head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the chief federal bank regulator, said in a speech earlier this year. 
 But he noted that what caused the largest problem for some banks was that they retained dangerously big positions in certain securities -- like C.D.O.'s -- rather than selling them off to other investors. 
 ''What most differentiated the companies sustaining the biggest losses from the rest was their willingness to hold exceptionally large positions on their balance sheets which, in turn, led to exceptionally large losses,'' he said.
 Mr. Dugan did not mention any specific bank by name, but Citigroup is the largest player in the C.D.O. business of any bank the comptroller regulates.
 For his part, Mr. Pandit faces the twin challenge of rebuilding investor confidence while trying to fix the company's myriad problems.
 Citigroup has suffered four consecutive quarters of multibillion-dollar losses as it has written down billions of dollars of the mortgage-related assets it held on its books.
 But investors worry there is still more to come, and some board members have raised doubts about Mr. Pandit's leadership, according to people briefed on the situation. 
 Citigroup still holds $20 billion of mortgage-linked securities on its books, the bulk of which have been marked down to between 21 cents and 41 cents on the dollar. It has billions of dollars of giant buyout and corporate loans. And it also faces a potential flood of losses on auto, mortgage and credit card loans as the global economy plunges into a recession. 
 Also, hundreds of billions of dollars in dubious assets that Citigroup held off its balance sheet is now starting to be moved back onto its books, setting off yet another potential problem.
 The bank has already put more than $55 billion in assets back on its balance sheet. It now says an added $122 billion of assets related to credit cards and possibly billions of dollars of other assets will probably come back on the books. 
 Even though Citigroup executives insist that the bank can ride out its current difficulties, and that the repatriated assets pose no threat, investors have their doubts. Because analysts do not have a complete grip on the quality of those assets, they are warning that Citigroup may have to set aside billions of dollars to guard against losses.
 In fact, some analysts say they believe that the $25 billion that the federal government invested in Citigroup this fall might not be enough to stabilize it.
 Others say the fact that such huge amounts have yet to steady the bank is a reflection of the severe damage caused by Citigroup's appetites. 
 ''They pushed to get earnings, but in doing so, they took on more risk than they probably should have if they are going to be, in the end, a bank subject to regulatory controls,'' said Roy Smith, a professor at the Stern School of Business at New York University. ''Safe and soundness has to be no less important than growth and profits but that was subordinated by these guys.''

HEADLINE: Report Sees Positives In Recession Fallout

BYLINE: By MARGARET FARLEY STEELE

 BODY:
ECONOMISTS are painting a gloomy canvas of Connecticut for the next couple of years, but the landscape is not totally bleak. 
 Connecticut went into a recession a year ago, but its effects will be mild, according to the November forecast from the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis at the University of Connecticut. The state could see 40, 000 job losses out of 1.7 million by the third quarter of 2010, bringing employment back to its 2005 level, the report said. It will also suffer a modest decline in economic output, but nothing as severe as the recessions of the last 30 years. 
 ''To date the pain has been remarkably little,'' the report says, noting the state's unemployment rate is still below the national rate. State unemployment for September was 6.1 percent, while the national average was 6.5 percent. October unemployment figures were expected to stay the same or rise, predicted John Tirinzonie, state labor economist. 
 But these predictions could be optimistic. Gov. M. Jodi Rell said at a recent news conference that some of her economic advisers thought job losses could reach 60,000 to 80,000 as a result of the Wall Street crisis. 
 The report said the state's aggregate output, or the sum total of goods and services it produces, will contract by about $6 billion from the third quarter of 2007, when the center said the state recession started, to the third quarter of 2010, shrinking to $176.3 billion.
 Also, the number of jobs lost does not take into account positions held by thousands of Connecticut residents employed in New York. The State Labor Department is working with counterparts in New York and New Jersey to assess the regional impact of the Wall Street crisis, but it is too early to estimate the effect on unemployment, Mr. Tirinzonie said. 
 For job seekers, even a ''mild'' recession is small consolation. ''In this economic downturn, it will be much harder to find a job,'' Mr. Tirinzonie said. 
 Still, there is some good news: The sharp drop in petroleum prices could save drivers an average of $600 a year, or $1.8 billion statewide, which would stimulate the economy if spent on other goods and services, the U Conn analysis says. Also, if fossil fuel prices continue declining, the boon to businesses could result in as few as 11,000 job losses, it says.
 But government financing initiatives will be important to restoring a robust economy, the report says.
 For one of the U Conn economists, the caliber of Connecticut's work force is more worrisome than the recent Wall Street meltdown. ''The real problem in Connecticut is the lack of job growth over the past 20 years,'' Fred V. Carstensen, director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis, said in a recent phone interview. ''We have fewer private sector jobs than in 1989, and a shrinking and declining work force. The state is losing its competitive edge.''
 High-wage jobs have been replaced by low-wage jobs, Mr. Carstensen said. Noting that Connecticut's best and brightest seek their fortunes elsewhere, he said, ''the least educated and least skilled don't leave the state.'' That means, he said, that social services will be overwhelmed in the future. 
 Others disagreed. ''We are moving more to a service-based economy,'' Mr. Tirinzonie said, ''which might have slightly lower paying jobs, but a good many still require post-secondary education.'' 
 Connecticut wants to retain its educated young people, Mr. Tirinzonie said. ''We have gotten proactive in trying to keep college students here or to relocate back here,'' he said. ''Our Job Expo this month made students aware of professional jobs in the Hartford-Springfield area.'' 
 As for housing, the decline in sales of single-family homes appears to be leveling off, but experts warn that this is not a sign of economic recovery. Statewide sales of single-family homes in September were down 5.3 percent from September 2007, bucking a trend of double-digit declines, according to the Warren Group, which tracks real estate transactions. Sales in Fairfield County dropped 6.27 percent in September, and the median house price in Fairfield County plunged 12.25 percent from last September.

HEADLINE: Like Romeo and Juliet, With a Happier Ever After

BYLINE: By DEVAN SIPHER

 BODY:
''MISS MORTON Didn't Elope'' was a headline in The New York Times of May 24, 1914. One supposes Miss Morton could have made the article even more newsworthy if the elopement had, in fact, taken place.
 ''Once upon a time eloping was scandalous,'' said Rebecca Mead, the author of ''One Perfect Day: The Selling of the American Wedding'' (Penguin Group, 2007), but, she pointed out, that era was before the average American wedding cost close to $30,000. ''There are a lot of people wanting to get married who don't want to put down the equivalent of a down payment on a house.''
 In a time of tightening budgets, some wedding professionals have seen an increase in elopements as couples consider it a practical alternative. 
 It's an age-old option. Romeo and Juliet did it. And, though it didn't turn out so well for them, it worked for the poets Elizabeth Barrett and Robert Browning. They, too, were circumventing parental disapproval, but nowadays the primary motivations are convenience and cost. 
 ''A wedding doesn't have to be a life-absorbing planning process, and it doesn't have to take up a year and a half of your lives,'' said Karla Neville, 27, who decided to elope with Gabe Evans in July while they were on vacation in Portland, Ore. 
 They had initially intended to have a more traditional event, but found themselves resenting the money and effort required. ''We promised each other when we got engaged we wouldn't let the process of planning a wedding stress us out,'' said Mr. Evans, 42, who is an art director and graphic designer in New York. Instead of marrying at a sit-down dinner for 70 people in New York, they wed on a mountaintop overlooking the Columbia River Gorge with only a minister and a photographer present, both of whom they found online.
 ''I liked the fact that it was just about Gabe and I,'' said Ms. Neville, an events assistant at Pernod Ricard, the wine and spirits company. ''We were able to say heartfelt things to each other without thinking of hundreds of eyes on us.''
 Elopement can be a more intimate and romantic experience than a traditional wedding, according to Lynn Beahan, an author, with Scott Shaw, of ''Let's Elope'' (Bantam, 2001), a compendium of elopement information. ''It's you declaring your love to somebody else just in front of that one other person,'' said Ms. Beahan, who eloped in Vermont in 2001. ''As a married couple you don't spend the rest of your life making big decisions in front of an audience.''
 In fact, having a large audience for a wedding is a relatively modern idea. Church weddings, for example, were not even an option for most people until the 16th century. 
 ''Formal church weddings were generally reserved for aristocrats,'' said John Witte, the director of the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at Emory University. He said that for those of lower rank many couples ''simply declared themselves to be married'' with or without a public component.
 Ms. Beahan said that ''until the late 19th century, most weddings were held at the bride's home. '' And as late as the 1930s, it was common to have only a ceremony without a reception, according to Ms. Mead's book. 
 That being said, Leslie Mesnick-Uretsky, 35, and her husband, Jonathan Uretsky, 34, had been saving for their wedding until they realized that ''unless we excluded people, it would be very large,'' she said. Neither option appealed to them. 
 ''The 50-person wedding would have been something very nice to do, but it's difficult to do without offending people,'' said Ms. Mesnick-Uretsky, who works in New York as an environmental impact consultant. 
 The couple were married in January at the Municipal Building in New York -- with their immediate families present. Ms. Beahan's book refers to this as a ''hybrid elopement,'' and it's increasingly popular, allowing couples to choose simplicity over extravagance without creating rifts in their relationships with their parents.
 ''I spent only $190 on my beautiful J. Crew wedding dress, which was less than any of the bridesmaid dresses I bought over the years,'' Ms. Mesnick-Uretsky said. The couple, with some assistance from the bride's father, also treated their families to a weekend at the Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, N.Y. Yet their wedding, including a two-week honeymoon in Japan, still cost less than $10,000.
 When Ted Flinter and Karine Morency eloped in May after living together for almost seven years, they did not include or even tell their parents. ''We didn't tell anyone,'' said Mr. Flinter, 39 and an owner of a security company in Abu Dhabi. ''We got engaged on a Thursday and went to Vegas four days later.''
 Once there, however, ''Karine did call her sister about five seconds before Elvis was about to marry us,'' Mr. Flinter said. His soon-to-be bride asked her sister to be the maid of honor and ''put the cellphone on the podium so she could listen in.''
 Mr. Flinter said that including gambling losses the wedding cost $1,350. ''We could have afforded a beautiful wedding,'' he said, but ''we dreaded the wedding registry and the seating charts.'' 
 Not everyone is as financially fortunate. ''People are saying, 'I lost my job, and I don't have the funds for a big wedding,' '' said Mary Beaty, a New York chaplain of the Humanist Society, who said she is performing twice as many elopement ceremonies as before. Chris Andrews, the owner of California Wedding Packages in Napa, Calif., concurred, saying, ''The elopement business is booming.''
 Ms. Beaty said she has seen the trend ''for the past six months if not a year.''
 ''Many young people,'' she added, ''are conscious about not wasting money and concerned about the expense for friends and family.''
 Yet large traditional weddings are not about to disappear.
 Ms. Mead, the author, said that Brides magazine was founded during the Great Depression. It was inspired by an article in Fortune, she said, ''Which noted that even at times of economic depression people could be relied upon to spend money on weddings.''

HEADLINE: The New Deal Didn't Always Work, Either

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
MANY people are looking back to the Great Depression and the New Deal for answers to our problems. But while we can learn important lessons from this period, they're not always the ones taught in school. 
 The traditional story is that President Franklin D. Roosevelt rescued capitalism by resorting to extensive government intervention; the truth is that Roosevelt changed course from year to year, trying a mix of policies, some good and some bad. It's worth sorting through this grab bag now, to evaluate whether any of these policies might be helpful. 
 If I were preparing a ''New Deal crib sheet,'' I would start with the following lessons: 
 MONETARY POLICY IS KEY As Milton Friedman and Anna Jacobson Schwartz argued in a classic book, ''A Monetary History of the United States,'' the single biggest cause of the Great Depression was that the Federal Reserve let the money supply fall by one-third, causing deflation. Furthermore, banks were allowed to fail, causing a credit crisis. Roosevelt's best policies were those designed to increase the money supply, get the banking system back on its feet and restore trust in financial institutions. 
 A study of the 1930s by Christina D. Romer, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley (''What Ended the Great Depression?,'' Journal of Economic History, 1992), confirmed that expansionary monetary policy was the key to the partial recovery of the 1930s. The worst years of the New Deal were 1937 and 1938, right after the Fed increased reserve requirements for banks, thereby curbing lending and moving the economy back to dangerous deflationary pressures.
 Today, expansionary monetary policy isn't so easy to put into effect, as we are seeing a shrinkage of credit and a contraction of the ''shadow banking sector,'' as represented by forms of derivatives trading, hedge funds and other investments. So don't expect the benefits of monetary expansion to kick in right now, or even six months from now. 
 Still, the Fed needs to stand ready to prevent a downward spiral and to stimulate the economy once it's possible.
 GET THE SMALL THINGS RIGHT It's not just monetary and fiscal policies that are important. Roosevelt instituted a disastrous legacy of agricultural subsidies and sought to cartelize industry, backed by force of law. Neither policy helped the economy recover. 
 He also took steps to strengthen unions and to keep real wages high. This helped workers who had jobs, but made it much harder for the unemployed to get back to work. One result was unemployment rates that remained high throughout the New Deal period. 
 Today, President-elect Barack Obama faces pressures to make unionization easier, but such policies are likely to worsen the recession for many Americans.
 DON'T RAISE TAXES IN A SLUMP The New Deal's legacy of public works programs has given many people the impression that it was a time of expansionary fiscal policy, but that isn't quite right. Government spending went up considerably, but taxes rose, too. Under President Herbert Hoover and continuing with Roosevelt, the federal government increased income taxes, excise taxes, inheritance taxes, corporate income taxes, holding company taxes and ''excess profits'' taxes. 
 When all of these tax increases are taken into account, New Deal fiscal policy didn't do much to promote recovery. Today, a tax cut for the middle class is a good idea -- and the case for repealing the Bush tax cuts for higher-income earners is weaker than it may have seemed a year or two ago.
 WAR ISN'T THE WEAPON World War II did help the American economy, but the gains came in the early stages, when America was still just selling war-related goods to Europe and was not yet a combatant. The economic historian Robert Higgs, a senior fellow at the Independent Institute, has shown in his 2006 book, ''Depression, War, and Cold War,'' just how much the war brought shortages and rationing of consumer goods. 
 While overall economic output was rising, and the military draft lowered unemployment, the war years were generally not prosperous ones. As for today, we shouldn't think that fighting a war is the way to restore economic health.
 YOU CAN'T TURN BAD TO GOOD The good New Deal policies, like constructing a basic social safety net, made sense on their own terms and would have been desirable in the boom years of the 1920s as well. The bad policies made things worse. Today, that means we should restrict extraordinary measures to the financial sector as much as possible and resist the temptation to ''do something'' for its own sake.
 In short, expansionary monetary policy and wartime orders from Europe, not the well-known policies of the New Deal, did the most to make the American economy climb out of the Depression. Our current downturn will end as well someday, and, as in the '30s, the recovery will probably come for reasons that have little to do with most policy initiatives.

HEADLINE: North Korea's Very Cautious Cinematic Thaw

BYLINE: By MALTE HERWIG

DATELINE: PYONGYANG, North Korea 

 BODY:
 HUMOR may not be the first thing that comes to mind when you think of the citizens of North Korea, a country known mostly for militant anti-Western propaganda, chronic food shortages and an internationally isolated government pursuing nuclear weapons. 
 And yet audiences at the 11th Pyongyang International Film Festival here clearly enjoyed themselves this fall during screenings of Western dramas and comedies, occasionally even erupting into riotous laughter. 
 In most other countries movies like Marcus H. Rosenmuller's ''Heavyweights,'' a lighthearted comedy about a group of Bavarian villagers contending in the 1952 Winter Olympics, would be harmless fun. But not in North Korea, and to prove it there was a man with a piece of cardboard sitting in the projection room to cover the lens in case anything deemed unseemly to Korean eyes was shown. 
 That day, mercifully, the cardboard-wielding censor wasn't particularly good at his job. His hapless attempts to maintain officially sanctioned decency only added to the amusement of the 2,000 moviegoers in the gigantic Pyongyang International Cinema House, who responded energetically to the sight of a half-dozen outsize German bobsledders baring their bottoms and stuffing themselves with food and beer to gain weight for a competition. 
 It was an unusual sight in this corner of the world, to say the least. 
 After more than a decade of natural disasters, famine and economic mismanagement, everyday life is no laughing matter for the 23 million Koreans north of the demilitarized zone, which has separated the Koreas since the end of the war between the two countries in 1953. For the past 60 years they have lived under the rule of just two men: the founder of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, who died in 1994, and his son Kim Jong-il. 
 Mr. Kim, who is known to be a film buff and connoisseur of Hollywood movies, reportedly finances a three-story building in Pyongyang with a full-time staff of 250 that houses his collection of 20,000 films from all over the world. Regular citizens must settle for homegrown propaganda movies like ''Five Guerilla Brothers,'' ''An Azalea Behind Enemy Lines'' and ''Wormwood Rice Cake, National Food.'' 
 But the festival, which ran from Sept. 17 to 26 and screened more than 100 films from at least 45 nations, including China, Russia, France and Italy (though not the United States, Japan or South Korea), offered a rare chance for ordinary North Koreans to get a glimpse of the outside world.
 An estimated 120,000 tickets were sold or distributed at workplaces throughout the city. Movies like Britain's ''Elizabeth: The Golden Age,'' Germany's ''And Along Came Tourists'' and the Chinese war drama ''Assembly,'' which carried off the festival prize as best film, played before full houses. Such was the run on tickets that large crowds had to be turned back by uniformed guards, and doors were chained once performances started. 
 After arriving, audience members were told through loudspeakers to sit in their own chairs and not leave any trash behind. (No one needed to be reminded to switch off their cellphones, as they are illegal in North Korea and all international visitors have to leave theirs at the airport on arrival.) 
 Most screenings took place at the International Cinema House, an imposing concrete structure built on an island in the Taedong River, which flows through the capital. Unlike earlier festivals, this one had no physical barriers separating North Koreans from foreigners -- mostly producers, distributors and movie executives -- although the official ''guides'' were keen to prevent any contact with the locals. 
 The festival is not your usual red-carpet, celebrity-studded affair. Or is it, just with a North Korean accent? Both in popular culture and as a propaganda tool, film is a central element of contemporary life here, and North Korean cinema has its own star system. Famous actors are depicted on murals around the city and even on official currency. 
 ''Kim Jong-il sees film as a highly effective tool to maintain his power,'' Suk-Young Kim, a scholar of Korean film at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said in a telephone interview. ''For him, it's one of the primary means of governing.''
 The closest you get to the Hollywood walk of fame is probably the Cemetery of the Patriotic Martyrs in the suburbs of Pyongyang, where a number of famous performers are buried. Mind you, they owe their fame largely to one person, and they know it. ''The ordinary film artists,'' a booklet titled ''Great Man and Art'' informs the English reader, ''have been able to ascend the high eminence of immortality under the special care of Comrade Kim Jong-il, their benevolent teacher and father.''
 Speaking after a screening of the film ''Flower Girl'' (1972), the actress Hong Young-hee recalled the advice Mr. Kim gave her on the set: ''The great general advised me how to wear my straw shoes properly and gave me meticulous guidance in acting, costume and props.'' 
 It was difficult to break free from the official program, given the tight schedule of visits to sites honoring the exploits of the two Kims combined with the remote island location of the festival cinema and the hotel where most foreign visitors stayed. Any detour had to be applied for at least a day in advance, and even then the answer would often be a curiously diplomatic ''Maybe it is impossible.'' 
 It was only after much persuasion that I managed to get into a screening at the Kaeson cinema in downtown Pyongyang, which was decorated with propaganda slogans and a heroic mural showing the two Kims. A large crowd of North Koreans seemed to enjoy ''When the Raven Flies,'' an unspeakably bad 1984 movie about murderous Vikings in medieval Iceland that was not improved by being (like all other foreign films here) voiced-over in Korean. But perhaps it was a welcome change of pace from fare like ''We Are the Happiest'' and ''Affection-Permeated Land.'' 
 Generally speaking, historical dramas or films from countries like Iran and Bangladesh are deemed less dangerous ideologically here than contemporary films from the West, which would expose North Koreans to a tempting display of Western life and wealth. Even so, the festival came with a health warning. At the opening ceremony the culture minister, Kang Nung-su, cautioned that filmgoing ''must not harm the sound mind of the people.'' 
 By all accounts economic difficulties have resulted in a dramatic decline in both the output and the quality of North Korean cinema. ''We are now making only two to three feature films a year,'' an official from the Korean Film Export and Import Corporation said, adding, ''They're not very good.'' 
 One exception at the festival was ''A Schoolgirl's Diary'' (2006), the most recent film from the prominent North Korean director Jang In-hak. The tale of a young girl whose father is working on a mysterious project far from home, it was a box office hit here, attracting an impressive eight million viewers, according to official figures, and even made it to Cannes. ''It's a very particular movie, which conveys rather well what one's life should be'' in North Korea, said James Velaise, whose company, Pretty Pictures, is distributing the film in France.
 The only new North Korean film, on the other hand, was ''The Kites Flying in the Sky'' (2008), based on a true story of a woman who gives up her career as a marathon runner to care for orphaned children. The foreign delegates were mostly critical,calling the scriptwriting incoherent and propagandistic.
 ''Everyone loves movies,'' Mr. Jang said over coffee at a hotel bar, ''but there is no one who loves them as much as the Dear Leader. He is a genius of filmmaking.'' 
 To prove his point he recounted how Mr. Kim ordered several dozen directors, screenwriters and cinematographers to attend movie boot camp several years ago. Holed up in a special hotel for six months, they watched more than 200 movies -- a varied group that included ''Gone With the Wind,''''Schindler's List,''''Saving Private Ryan,''''Braveheart'' and ''Troy'' -- and reported their observations about filmmaking techniques in letters to the Dear Leader. 
 Mr. Kim was unable to attend the boot camp, Mr. Jang said, ''but he called us almost every day, sometimes in the early hours in the morning, to tell us what to look for in terms of story writing, acting and editing.''

HEADLINE: Strategies for Car Shopping in a Time of Tighter Credit

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
FOR anyone reading the headlines, the car-buying experience seems to have quickly gone from bad to worse. Finance companies have cut back on loans and become stingier with leases -- if they are still leasing at all.
 Home-equity loans once used in at least one of every nine car purchases are no longer an easy down-payment option. And trade-in values are falling fast, especially for pickups and S.U.V.'s. 
 But for consumers, the credit crunch may have a silver lining. 
 ''Dealerships are desperate to sell cars,'' said William Ryan, who follows the auto finance industry for Portales Partners, an independent research firm in Manhattan. ''The reality is, you are probably going to get a pretty good deal if you can afford it. There is a lot of heavy discounting going on.'' 
 On average, automakers are doling out incentives worth more than $2,675, up 23 percent from a year ago, according to the auto information site Edmunds.com (which lists rebates on its site). Some dealers are discounting S.U.V.'s by more than $10,000. 
 Automakers have reported falling sales numbers for months, with the annualized sales rate for October the worst in 25 years, according to data compiled by a trade journal, Ward's Automotive Reports. Automakers are on pace to sell fewer than 11 million vehicles in 2008, about a third fewer than the annual average of the last decade. Although 2009 models are in showrooms, last year's vehicles remain on dealership lots, and unusually high inventory-financing costs are giving dealers more reason to clear out the surplus by offering sweet deals.
 ''It's a buyer's market right now,'' said Adam J. Renie, sales manager at Gray Auto, an independent used-car dealership in Greenfield, Ind. ''Anybody who is an able buyer, you are making sure they end up in your vehicle.''
 So how should you go about making your purchasing decision? Should you lease or own? And what should you do about your old vehicle? Here are some things to consider before buying a vehicle in the current environment:
 EXPLORE YOUR FINANCING OPTIONS The contrast between the most credit-worthy borrowers and those with black marks has never been so great.
 ''If you have very good credit as a customer, you can expect a smooth approval process as well as attractive rates,'' said Jesse Torpak, chief industry analyst for Edmunds.com. ''If you are classified as a subprime borrower, things are going to be a lot more challenging.'' In fact, some lenders like GMAC are now making car loans only to borrowers with high credit scores.
 But what can you expect if you fall somewhere in between? The truth is, ordinary borrowers are still able to obtain financing. The terms are just more stringent than they used to be. 
 Lenders are now demanding that weaker borrowers come up with a 10 to 15 percent down payment, whereas only six months ago lenders were happy to provide financing without any cash up front. They are also requesting more information to verify applicants' income. And lenders have started raising interest rates, to a range of 7 to 15 percent depending on a buyer's credit history. 
 The result is that a customer with weak credit will pay about $7,100 more in interest for a $28,000 five-year loan than a borrower with pristine credit, according to an Edmunds.com analysis.
 That makes it important to shop for the car loan before you look for the car. Start by going to an online lender, like Capital One Financial or E-Loan. It will take your application, offer an interest rate, approve you for a specific dollar amount and mail you a bank check the next day. Or head to your local bank or credit union to check its offers.
 The car dealership should be your last stop for a loan. Typically, dealers offer loans from the financing arm of the car's manufacturer, and then mark the rate up for a profit.
 That usually makes dealer financing the most expensive option, if you even qualify. But there is one big exception: to sell more cars, sometimes the manufacturer subsidizes the financing so that the dealer can offer a lower rate. Infiniti, Nissan and Toyota are among automakers offering zero-percent financing on selected models -- for customers with good credit histories. New deals seem to turn up each week.
 Still, that only reinforces why it is important to check out the interest rates elsewhere. Otherwise, Mr. Torpak said, ''You will have no basis to judge if the rate at the dealership is fair.''
 RECONSIDER WHETHER TO LEASE For many buyers, it used to be a toss-up whether it was better to lease or own. No longer. Leasing, which until recently accounted for a fifth of the new vehicle market, is no longer as attractive for consumers. Leases may not even be available for many trucks and S.U.V.'s.
 In July, Chrysler said it was ending all leasing deals in the United States. Ford, GMAC and several major banks have scaled back leasing operations. 
 Some European and Japanese automakers are still offering leases, especially for luxury vehicles. Even so, the monthly payments are likely to be higher than in the past.
 Keeping your monthly payment low is a two-step process. First, negotiate the lowest possible purchase price as if you were buying the car for cash. Then, shop around for the highest possible residual price, which is the vehicle's projected value when you turn it back in. 
 In a lease deal, the vehicle is owned by a bank or finance company, and you effectively rent it, typically for two or three years. Selling the vehicle at lease-end becomes the leasing company's responsibility, so the higher the residual value, the better your lease deal is likely to be. Different leasing companies may set different residual values. 
 Of course, the economics of leasing are no longer as favorable as they once were. One reason is that residual values have plunged, especially as gas-guzzlers have flooded the used-car market. For example, the residual value for the average S.U.V. is about 10 percent lower than last year, according to the Automotive Lease Guide. For a full-size S.U.V. with a $42,000 sticker price, that would cause monthly lease payments to rise about $150 a month, all else being equal.
 On top of that, automakers are no longer inflating residual values or subsidizing finance charges. That makes leasing even costlier. 
 BEWARE OF LONGER LOANS To keep monthly payments lower, car companies are pushing longer loans, sometimes for six years or more.
 If you plan to keep a car that long, the longer payback schedule may not matter much. But for anyone who plans to get a new vehicle in two or three years, longer loans are not a good deal. 
 Here's why: if you are spreading payments over eight years, but the vehicle is going to depreciate greatly over five years, you still have to make another three years of payments. 
 ''To get out of that deal, the consumer is looking at a situation where they will have to go into their pocket to pay off that loan,'' said John Blair, chief executive of the Automotive Lease Guide. ''That is the potential risk.''
 LOOK BEFORE YOU TRADE-IN Call it reverse sticker-shock. Buyers have long braced themselves for high prices on their dream cars. But many are even more surprised by how little their vehicles are worth when they sell them.
 Prices for the biggest S.U.V.'s and pickup trucks are down more than 23 percent from October 2007, according to the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index. Other categories have been similarly hard hit. On average, prices of used vans have fallen 15.9 percent, used sports cars by 6.1 percent and luxury cars by 8.7 percent.
 Because selling your car now may be like selling stock at the bottom of the market, it may be prudent to keep it.
 To get a sense of what your car is worth, you can consult the Kelley Blue Book or its online edition at KBB.com. But there is no substitute for testing the market yourself. 
 On the flip side, those ending a lease may have unknowingly hit a jackpot. You may be able to negotiate a lower price to buy the car outright instead of turning it back in.
 KNOW WHEN TO WALK Buying a car can be stressful. In part, that's because it really means negotiating two deals -- and possibly three. 
 Savvy buyers will negotiate the purchase price of their car first, then haggle over the terms of the financing. Finally, they negotiate the value of a trade-in separately. 
 If the dealer refuses to discount the car unless you use the company's financing, that's your cue to leave.

HEADLINE: Shelter Is Forced Out, and a Suit Follows

BYLINE: By SEAN D. HAMILL

DATELINE: BROOKVILLE, Pa. 

 BODY:
There was no doubt in the Rev. Jack L. Wisor's mind that he was doing the right thing when he decided to open a homeless shelter here four years ago.
 ''I was called to do this by the Lord,'' said Mr. Wisor, 45, a fiery born-again evangelical pastor whose often unfiltered passion has created as many enemies as it has friends in this town 80 miles northeast of Pittsburgh.
 But after local officials noticed he was housing people in the 111-year-old First Apostles' Doctrine Church and parsonage this past summer, they were not so sure they wanted the Just for Jesus shelter so close to the small town's restored Main Street. 
 Downtown Brookville is a five-block-long strip of red-brick businesses and Victorian homes, highlighted by the 141-year-old Jefferson County courthouse, making up a district inevitably called quaint by travel magazines.
 The borough considered Mr. Wisor's shelter a ''group home'' that was banned by zoning for the area. In August, they forced him to move the four people who were living there to another shelter he has in nearby Brockway -- where he has also battled the local government over its use.
 ''We were just trying to enforce our zoning codes,'' said Stephen W. French, Brookville's borough lawyer. ''There was certainly no intent to discriminate here.''
 But that is exactly what the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania alleged in a lawsuit filed last week on Mr. Wisor's behalf. 
 The suit claims violation of the First Amendment, as well as the federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, which largely prohibits local governments from preventing religious organizations from carrying out their missions.
 ''At the core of this is that it's difficult for the borough officials to wrap their mind around the concept that church use is more than a Sunday service,'' said Witold J. Walczak, the organization's legal director. ''This entire church is set up to help the least fortunate.''
 On Tuesday, a day after the lawsuit was filed, a federal judge granted a 60-day consent order that would allow Mr. Wisor to continue to use the site as a shelter while the two sides try to negotiate a permanent settlement.
 The quick move was in large part because of the education that borough officials received on federal law, even if it did not seem fair to them.
 ''I'm a small-town lawyer, and I'm not using that as an excuse, but I had not read those 2007 and 2008 federal decisions on this law,'' Mr. French said. ''The way I see it, it's an abuse of federal power to override our zoning laws.''
 Many people in the area point out that even though Mr. Wisor's aim is worthy, with his fiery persona, he can sometimes be his own worst enemy.
 ''I think he's a minister of the Gospel. He's doing good work,'' said the Rev. Tim McConville, pastor of Evangelical United Methodist Church in Brookville, and president of the Brookville Ministerial Association. ''He often comes in with both guns blazing, and you're either with him or against him.''
 Mr. Wisor said he just preaches the Gospel, ''and I don't back down.''
 He said the issue flared up this summer when, for the first time, he had two black men staying at the shelter -- a fact that caught the attention of local business owners and officials, who had not even realized he was using the building.
 ''That's an outrageous statement,'' Mr. French replied. ''There's other black people in town; why would the borough care?''
 David Galbraith, owner of Galbraith Furniture, which is on Main Street, directly behind the Just for Jesus shelter, said that in a town of 4,230 that is 98 percent white, it was only natural that a stranger who was black would stand out. He said he had first noticed the shelter when one of the two black men dug in a trash bin behind his store.
 He said it bothered him when he learned that one of the two men was wanted on a criminal warrant in Ohio.
 For many in town, Mr. Wisor's shelter is something that is just not needed.
 ''If there is a large call to have a shelter because there's a lot of local homeless people, I haven't heard it,'' Mr. French said. 
 Mr. Galbraith agreed. ''No, no, there's not a lot of homeless here,'' he said. ''The residents I've met at that shelter are from Cleveland and New York and Erie, not here.'' 
 But Mr. Wisor, a former home builder who began his ministry in 2002 after recovering from alcohol and drug addiction, said that roughly 75 percent of the 400 people he had helped through his shelters were from the area, even if they were largely invisible to many of the locals.
 ''Two weeks after I opened my shelter in Brockway, I had 36 people living there,'' Mr. Wisor said. ''And I asked people why they'd say there isn't a homeless problem.''
 A study released last month by a local task force found that at least 200 adults and children go homeless each year in Jefferson and nearby Clarion County.
 ''The numbers we got were surprising,'' said Sue Ann Blakesless, chairwoman of the task force. ''And with the economy, they're only going to get worse. His shelter certainly fills a need.''

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 11-23-08: Frugalista

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
The lexies at the New Oxford American Dictionary took a deep breath this month and made public their choice for 2008's Word of the Year: hypermiling, defined as an ''attempt to maximize gas mileage by making fuel-conserving adjustments to one's car and one's driving techniques.'' This can range from the sensible checking of tire pressures to the more esoteric driving in bare feet. In auto-crazy California, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger prefers another coinage for the practice: EcoDriving, with an oh-so-with-it capital D instead of the old-fashioned hyphen. 
 Neither of these concocted words revs up my linguistic engine. That's because they are news-specific (or as they write it in Sacramento, NewsSpecific). But what the vocabulary needs when gas is an astronomical $4 a gallon is far from the same when the price at the pump falls back to a more earthly $2. My choice for the Word of 2008 has to be attuned to the economic event writers will be dealing with in 2009: a word for the recession (which we optimists call ''the prerecovery period''). 
 Fortunately, Oxford's neologists have provided us with their shortlist (that's one word now, just in time for the interregnum's farrago of choices), from which we can make our own choice of hottest word. One entry is CarrotMob, ''a flash-mob type of gathering, in which people are invited via the Net to all support and reward a local small ethical business by patronizing it at the same time.'' Sorry, that's too specialized. Another is topless meeting, ''in which the participants are barred from using their laptops, BlackBerries, cellphones, etc.'' Nope; that conjures an image in my mind of a board meeting with all participants stripped to the waist, sitting around in minikinis, causing some sexist executives to call for a smoked-glass ceiling.
 But wait: one entry on the Oxford shortlist rings my bell, with its rich etymology, current utility and potential staying power well beyond the nonce. It is frugalista, defined as ''a person who lives a frugal lifestyle but stays fashionable and healthy by swapping clothes, buying secondhand, growing own produce, etc.'' This could become the nom de guerre of the ''recession warrior.''
 Ista -- the Spanish version of the English suffix ist, as its ismo is our ism -- was adopted as a combining form in our language in 1928 with the Sandinistas, the name for the supporters of the Nicaraguan Socialist-Nationalist leader Augusto Cesar Sandino. A political party was founded in his name in 1963 and is currently the elected government of that nation. 
 The American fashion world picked up the suffix in the 1990s. Sarah Hilliard, an associate editor at Oxford University Press, informs me that the coiner of fashionista was Stephen Fried, who defined the word in ''Thing of Beauty,'' his 1993 biography of the supermodel Gia, as ''the army of models, photographers, designers, hair and makeup people who toiled daily in the fashion trenches.'' It has since been given a broader meaning to cover ''one who closely follows fashion,'' though some meanspirited anti-eliteniks use it as a synonym for ''clotheshorse.'' 
 Arbiters of good usage resigned to being called ''word police'' have been denounced as wordinistas, just as nosy reporters have been derogated as scandalistas. In 2007, when a mild downturn was seen by some as necessary to avert a future bust, recessionista surfaced, coined by the economist Larry Kudlow, and was defined in The Times as ''the new name for the style maven on a budget.'' It faced a fierce competitor, however, in frugalista, used in 2005 by The Palm Beach Post and The Toronto Star and picked up since in a Miami Herald blog by Natalie McNeal that she calls the Frugalista Files. 
 I think frugalista has a nice ring to it and is not as obvious as recessionista. The adjective frugal is rooted in the Latin for ''fruits,'' which in the 16th century some found relatively cheap. The word was at first applied to the careful apportionment of food, but Shakespeare in his 1598 ''Merry Wives of Windsor'' used it as a metaphor to mean ''sparingly supplied; thrifty'' of anything, as, ''I was then Frugall of my mirth.''
 Concerned about your budget in this year's market debacle? Sharpening your pencil and tightening your belt, foraging for bargains but not altogether abandoning good food and good screens? Join the frugalistas! 
 OXYMORON REDUX
 ''I want to move with all deliberate haste,'' said President-elect Barack Obama at his first, brief press conference after his election, ''but I emphasize 'deliberate' as well as 'haste.' ''
 It's not easy to be both deliberate and hasty at the same time unless you are consciously embracing an oxymoron -- from the Greek word meaning ''pointedly foolish'' -- and it is a jarring juxtaposition of contradictory words like ''cruel kindness'' and ''thunderous silence.''
 Obama based his oxymoron on a phrase in a 1954 Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education, ordering the striking down of segregation in schools ''with all deliberate speed.'' In 1964, Justice William Brennan wrote: ''There has been entirely too much deliberation and not enough speed. The time for mere 'deliberate speed' has run out.''
 Years ago, researching the phrase for my political dictionary, I sought the help of Justice Potter Stewart, who found it in a 1912 decision by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes drawing on English chancery law. Stewart informed me that the curious formulation later became a favorite of Justice Felix Frankfurter, who used it five times in his decisions.
 Deeper research had been done by President Lincoln. A friend recollected a similar oxymoron in 1861 when Lincoln was asked if he favored the immediate emancipation of slaves. ''It will do no good,'' he replied, ''to go ahead any faster than the country will follow. . . . You know that old Latin motto, festina lente.'' That was reportedly a frequent saying of Augustus Caesar and can be translated to mean ''make haste slowly.''

HEADLINE: With Help, London For the Holidays Is Doable

BYLINE: By HILARY HOWARD

 BODY:
 Let's face it, it's going to take more than a stronger dollar to persuade recession-strained Americans to hop across the Atlantic for the holiday season. But it might help to know that from Dec. 19 to Jan. 4, the rates at London's Radisson Edwardian Hotels, including the luxe Mayfair (www.radissonedwardian.com/bed&breakfast) are the lowest of the year, ranging from $:120 to $:195 a night ($172 to $304, at $1.56 to the pound), based on double occupancy. 
 It might also help to know that admission is free -- not just over the holidays, but all year -- to a number of museums, including the Victoria and Albert and the British Museum (www.visitlondon.com). 
 And if you're looking for cheap eats, a new publication, ''Savoir Fare London, Stylish Dining for Under $25'' by Elaine Louie of The New York Times (New York Review of Books, $14.95), available in stores on Dec. 2, might do the trick. The highlighted restaurants include Books for Cooks, a five-table cafe in the back of a Notting Hill cookbook shop where the dishes are from recipes found in books for sale. Another is the Story Deli, above, a popular pizza place that opened in 2004 in East London (Spitalfields).

 BODY:
THE ''NAPOLEON DYNAMITE'' problem is driving Len Bertoni crazy. Bertoni is a 51-year-old ''semiretired'' computer scientist who lives an hour outside Pittsburgh. In the spring of 2007, his sister-in-law e-mailed him an intriguing bit of news: Netflix, the Web-based DVD-rental company, was holding a contest to try to improve Cinematch, its ''recommendation engine.'' The prize: $1 million. 
 Cinematch is the bit of software embedded in the Netflix Web site that analyzes each customer's movie-viewing habits and recommends other movies that the customer might enjoy. (Did you like the legal thriller ''The Firm''? Well, maybe you'd like ''Michael Clayton.'' Or perhaps ''A Few Good Men.'') The Netflix Prize goes to anyone who can make Cinematch's predictions 10 percent more accurate. One million dollars might sound like an awfully big prize for such a small improvement. But in fact, Netflix's founders tried for years to improve Cinematch, with only incremental results, and they knew that a 10 percent bump would be a challenge for even the most deft programmer. They also knew that, as Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, told me recently, ''getting to 10 percent would certainly be worth well in excess of $1 million'' to the company. The competition was announced in October 2006, and no one has won yet, though 30,000 hackers worldwide are hard at work on the problem. Each day, teams submit their updated solutions to the Netflix Prize Web page, and Netflix instantly calculates how much better than Cinematch they are. (There's even a live ''leader board'' ranking the top contestants.)
 In March 2007, Bertoni decided he wanted to give it a crack. So he downloaded a huge set of data that Netflix put online: an enormous list showing how 480,189 of the company's customers rated 17,770 Netflix movies. When Netflix customers log into their accounts, they can rate any movie from one to five stars, to help ''teach'' the Netflix system what their preferences are; the average customer has rated around 200 movies, so Netflix has a lot of information about what its customers like and don't like. (The data set doesn't include any personal information -- names, ages, location and gender have been stripped out.) So Bertoni began looking for patterns that would predict customer behavior -- specifically, an algorithm that would guess correctly the number of stars a given user would apply to a given movie. A year and a half later, Bertoni is still going, often spending 20 hours a week working on it in his home office. His two children -- 12 and 13 years old -- sometimes sit and brainstorm with him. ''They're very good with mathematics and algebra,'' he told me, chuckling. ''And they think of interesting questions about your movie-watching behavior.'' For example, one day the kids wondered about sequels: would a Netflix user who liked the first two ''Matrix'' movies be just as likely to enjoy the third one, even though it was widely considered to be pretty dreadful?
 Each time he or his kids think of a new approach, Bertoni writes a computer program to test it. Each new algorithm takes on average three or four hours to churn through the data on the family's ''quad core'' Gateway computer. Bertoni's results have gradually improved. When I last spoke to him, he was at No. 8 on the leader board; his program was 8.8 percent better than Cinematch. The top team was at 9.44 percent. Bertoni said he thought he was within striking distance of victory. 
 But his progress had slowed to a crawl. The more Bertoni improved upon Netflix, the harder it became to move his number forward. This wasn't just his problem, though; the other competitors say that their progress is stalling, too, as they edge toward 10 percent. Why?
 Bertoni says it's partly because of ''Napoleon Dynamite,'' an indie comedy from 2004 that achieved cult status and went on to become extremely popular on Netflix. It is, Bertoni and others have discovered, maddeningly hard to determine how much people will like it. When Bertoni runs his algorithms on regular hits like ''Lethal Weapon'' or ''Miss Congeniality'' and tries to predict how any given Netflix user will rate them, he's usually within eight-tenths of a star. But with films like ''Napoleon Dynamite,'' he's off by an average of 1.2 stars.
 The reason, Bertoni says, is that ''Napoleon Dynamite'' is very weird and very polarizing. It contains a lot of arch, ironic humor, including a famously kooky dance performed by the titular teenage character to help his hapless friend win a student-council election. It's the type of quirky entertainment that tends to be either loved or despised. The movie has been rated more than two million times in the Netflix database, and the ratings are disproportionately one or five stars.
 Worse, close friends who normally share similar film aesthetics often heatedly disagree about whether ''Napoleon Dynamite'' is a masterpiece or an annoying bit of hipster self-indulgence. When Bertoni saw the movie himself with a group of friends, they argued for hours over it. ''Half of them loved it, and half of them hated it,'' he told me. ''And they couldn't really say why. It's just a difficult movie.''
 Mathematically speaking, ''Napoleon Dynamite'' is a very significant problem for the Netflix Prize. Amazingly, Bertoni has deduced that this single movie is causing 15 percent of his remaining error rate; or to put it another way, if Bertoni could anticipate whether you'd like ''Napoleon Dynamite'' as accurately as he can for other movies, this feat alone would bring him 15 percent of the way to winning the $1 million prize. And while ''Napoleon Dynamite'' is the worst culprit, it isn't the only troublemaker. A small subset of other titles have caused almost as much bedevilment among the Netflix Prize competitors. When Bertoni showed me a list of his 25 most-difficult-to-predict movies, I noticed they were all similar in some way to ''Napoleon Dynamite'' -- culturally or politically polarizing and hard to classify, including ''I Heart Huckabees,'' ''Lost in Translation,'' ''Fahrenheit 9/11,'' ''The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou,'' ''Kill Bill: Volume 1'' and ''Sideways.''
 So this is the question that gently haunts the Netflix competition, as well as the recommendation engines used by other online stores like Amazon and iTunes. Just how predictable is human taste, anyway? And if we can't understand our own preferences, can computers really be any better at it?
 IT USED TO BE THAT if you wanted to buy a book, rent a movie or shop for some music, you had to rely on flesh-and-blood judgment -- yours, or that of someone you trusted. You'd go to your local store and look for new stuff, or you might just wander the aisles in what librarians call a stack search, to see if anything jumped out at you. You might check out newspaper reviews or consult your friends; if you were lucky, your local video store employed one of those young cineastes who could size you up in a glance and suggest something suitable.
 The advent of online retailing completely upended this cultural and economic ecosystem. First of all, shopping over the Web is not a social experience; there are no clever clerks to ask for advice. What's more, because they have no real space constraints, online stores like Amazon or iTunes can stock millions of titles, making a stack search essentially impossible. This creates the classic problem of choice: how do you decide among an effectively infinite number of options?
 But Web sites have this significant advantage over brick-and-mortar stores: They can track everything their customers do. Every page you visit, every purchase you make, every item you rate -- it is all recorded. In the early '90s, scientists working in the field of ''machine learning'' realized that this enormous trove of data could be used to analyze patterns in people's taste. In 1994, Pattie Maes, an M.I.T. professor, created one of the first recommendation engines by setting up a Web site where people listed songs and bands they liked. Her computer algorithm performed what's known as collaborative filtering. It would take a song you rated highly, find other people who had also rated it highly and then suggest you try a song that those people also said they liked.
 ''We had this realization that if we gathered together a really large group of people, like thousands or millions, they could help one another find things, because you can find patterns in what they like,'' Maes told me recently. ''It's not necessarily the one, single smart critic that is going to find something for you, like, 'Go see this movie, go listen to this band!' ''
 In one sense, collaborative filtering is less personalized than a store clerk. The clerk, in theory anyway, knows a lot about you, like your age and profession and what sort of things you enjoy; she can even read your current mood. (Are you feeling lousy? Maybe it's not the day for ''Apocalypse Now.'') A collaborative-filtering program, in contrast, knows very little about you -- only what you've bought at a Web site and whether you rated it highly or not. But the computer has numbers on its side. It may know only a little bit about you, but it also knows a little bit about a huge number of other people. This lets it detect patterns we often cannot see on our own. For example, Maes's music-recommendation system discovered that people who like classical music also like the Beatles. It is an epiphany that perhaps make sense when you think about it for a second, but it isn't immediately obvious.
 Soon after Maes's work made its debut, online stores quickly understood the value of having a recommendation system, and today most Web sites selling entertainment products have one. Most of them use some variant of collaborative filtering -- like Amazon's ''Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought'' function. Some setups ask you to actively rate products, as Netflix does. But others also rely on passive information. They keep track of your everyday behavior, looking for clues to your preferences. (For example, many music-recommendation engines -- like the Genius feature on Apple's iTunes, Microsoft's Mixview music recommender or the Audioscrobbler program at Last.fm -- can register every time you listen to a song on your computer or MP3 player.) And a few rare services actually pay people to evaluate products; the Pandora music-streaming service has 50 employees who listen to songs and tag them with descriptors -- ''upbeat,'' ''minor key,'' ''prominent vocal harmonies.''
 Netflix came late to the party. The company opened for business in 1997, but for the first three years it offered no recommendations. This wasn't such a big problem when Netflix stocked only 1,000 titles or so, because customers could sift through those pretty quickly. But Netflix grew, and today, it stocks more than 100,000 movies. ''I think that once you get beyond 1,000 choices, a recommendation system becomes critical,'' Hastings, the Netflix C.E.O., told me. ''People have limited cognitive time they want to spend on picking a movie.''
 Cinematch was introduced in 2000, but the first version worked poorly -- ''a mix of insightful and boneheaded recommendations,'' according to Hastings. His programmers slowly began improving the algorithms. They could tell how much better they were getting by trying to replicate how a customer rated movies in the past. They took the customer's ratings from, say, 2001, and used them to predict their ratings for 2002. Because Netflix actually had those later ratings, it could discern what a ''perfect'' prediction would look like. Soon, Cinematch reached the point where it could tease out some fairly nuanced -- and surprising -- connections. For example, it found that people who enjoy ''The Patriot'' also tend to like ''Pearl Harbor,'' which you'd expect, since they're both history-war-action movies; but it also discovered that they like the heartstring-tugging drama ''Pay It Forward'' and the sci-fi movie ''I, Robot.''
 Cinematch has, in fact, become a video-store roboclerk: its suggestions now drive a surprising 60 percent of Netflix's rentals. It also often steers a customer's attention away from big-grossing hits toward smaller, independent movies. Traditional video stores depend on hits; just-out-of-the-theaters blockbusters account for 80 percent of what they rent. At Netflix, by contrast, 70 percent of what it sends out is from the backlist -- older movies or small, independent ones. A good recommendation system, in other words, does not merely help people find new stuff. As Netflix has discovered, it also spurs them to consume more stuff.
 For Netflix, this is doubly important. Customers pay a flat monthly rate, generally $16.99 (although cheaper plans are available), to check out as many movies as they want. The problem with this business model is that new members often have a couple of dozen movies in mind that they want to see, but after that they're not sure what to check out next, and their requests slow. And a customer paying $17 a month for only one movie every month or two is at risk of canceling his subscription; the plan makes financial sense, from a user's point of view, only if you rent a lot of movies. (My wife and I once quit Netflix for precisely this reason.) Every time Hastings increases the quality of Cinematch even slightly, it keeps his customers active.
 But by 2006, Cinematch's improving performance had plateaued. Netflix's programmers couldn't go any further on their own. They suspected that there was a big breakthrough out there; the science of recommendation systems was booming, and computer scientists were publishing hundreds of papers each year on the subject. At a staff meeting in the summer of 2006, Hastings suggested a radical idea: Why not have a public contest? Netflix's recommendation system was powered by the wisdom of crowds; now it would tap the wisdom of crowds to get better too.
 AS HASTINGS HOPED, the contest has galvanized nerds around the world. The Top 10 list for the Netflix Prize currently includes a group of programmers in Austria (who are at No. 2), a trained psychologist and Web consultant in Britain who uses his teenage daughter to perform his calculus (No. 9), a lone Ph.D. candidate in Boston who calls himself My Brain and His Chain (a reference to a Ben Folds song; he's at No. 6) and Pragmatic Theory -- two French-Canadian guys in Montreal (No. 3). Nearly every team is working on the prize in its spare time. In October, when I dropped by the house of Martin Chabbert, a 32-year-old member of the Pragmatic Theory duo, it was only 8:30 at night, but we had to whisper: his four children, including a 2-month-old baby, had just gone to bed upstairs. In his small dining room, a laptop sat open next to children's books like ''Les Robots: Au Service de L'homme'' and a ''Star Wars'' picture book in French.
 ''This is where I do everything,'' Chabbert said. ''After the kids are asleep and I've packed the lunches for school, I come down at 9 in the evening and work until 11 or 12. It was very exciting in the beginning!'' He laughed. ''It still is, but with the baby now, going to bed at midnight is not a good idea.''
 Pragmatic Theory formed last spring, when Chabbert's longtime friend Martin Piotte -- a 43-year-old electrical and computer engineer -- heard about the Netflix Prize. Like many of the amateurs trying to win the $1 million, they had no relevant expertise. (''Absolutely no background in statistics that was useful,'' Piotte told me ruefully. ''Two guys, absolutely no clue.'') But they soon discovered that the Netflix competition is a fairly collegial affair. The company hosts a discussion board devoted to the prize, and competitors frequently help one another out -- discussing algorithms they've tried and publicly brainstorming new ways to improve their work, sometimes even posting reams of computer code for anyone to use. When someone makes a breakthrough, pretty soon every other team is aware of it and starts using it, too. Piotte and Chabbert soon learned the major mathematical tricks that had propelled the leading teams into the Top 10.
 The first major breakthrough came less than a month into the competition. A team named Simon Funk vaulted from nowhere into the No. 4 position, improving upon Cinematch by 3.88 percent in one fell swoop. Its secret was a mathematical technique called singular value decomposition. It isn't new; mathematicians have used it for years to make sense of prodigious chunks of information. But Netflix never thought to try it on movies.
 Singular value decomposition works by uncovering ''factors'' that Netflix customers like or don't like. Say, for example, that ''Sleepless in Seattle'' has been rated by 200,000 Netflix users. In one sense, this is just a huge list of numbers -- user No. 452 gave it two stars; No. 985 gave it five stars; and so on. But you could also think of those ratings as individual reactions to various aspects of the movie. ''Sleepless in Seattle'' is a ''chick flick,'' a comedy, a star vehicle for Tom Hanks; each customer is reacting to how much -- or how little -- he or she likes ''chick flicks,'' comedies and Tom Hanks. Singular value decomposition takes the mass of Netflix data -- 17,770 movies, ratings by 480,189 users -- and automatically sorts the films. The programmers do not actively tell the computer what to look for; they just run the algorithm until it groups together movies that share qualities with predictive value.
 Sometimes when you look at the clusters of movies, you can deduce the connections. Chabbert showed me one list: at the top were ''Sleepless in Seattle,'' ''Steel Magnolias'' and ''Pretty Woman,'' while at the bottom were ''Star Trek'' movies. Clearly, the computer recognized some factor that suggests that someone who likes the romantic aspect of ''Pretty Woman'' will probably like ''Sleepless in Seattle'' and dislike ''Star Trek.'' Chabbert showed me another cluster: this time DVD collections of the TV show ''Friends'' all clustered at the top of the list, while action movies like ''Reindeer Games'' and thrillers like ''Hannibal'' clustered at the bottom. Most likely, the computer had selected for ''comic'' content here. Other lists appear to group movies based on whether they lean strongly to the ideological right or left.
 As programmers extract more and more values, it becomes possible to draw exceedingly sophisticated correlations among movies and hence to offer incredibly nuanced recommendations. ''We're teasing out very subtle human behaviors,'' said Chris Volinsky, a scientist with AT&T in New Jersey who is one of the most successful Netflix contestants; his three-person team held the No. 1 position for more than a year. His team relies, in part, on singular value decomposition. ''You can find things like 'People who like action movies, but only if there's a lot of explosions, and not if there's a lot of blood. And maybe they don't like profanity,' '' Volinsky told me when we spoke recently. ''Or it's like 'I like action movies, but not if they have Keanu Reeves and not if there's a bus involved.' ''
 MOST OF THE LEADING TEAMS competing for the Netflix Prize now use singular value decomposition. Indeed, given how quickly word of new breakthroughs spreads among the competitors, virtually every team in the Top 10 makes use of similar mathematical ploys. The only thing that separates their scores is how skillfully they tweak their algorithms. The Netflix Prize has come to resemble a drag race in which everyone drives the same car, with only tiny modifications to the fuel injection. Yet those tweaks are crucial. Since the top teams are so close -- there is less than a tenth of a percent between each contender -- even tiny improvements can boost a team to the top of the charts.
 These days, the competitors spend much of their time thinking deeply about the math and psychology behind recommendations. For example, the teams are grappling with the problem that over time, people can change how sternly or leniently they rate movies. Psychological studies show that if you ask someone to rate a movie and then, a month later, ask him to do so again, the rating varies by an average of 0.4 stars. ''The question is why,'' Len Bertoni said to me. ''Did you just remember it differently? Did you see something in between? Did something change in your life that made you rethink it?'' Some teams deal with this by programming their computers to gradually discount older ratings.
 Another common problem is identifying overly punitive raters. If you're a really harsh critic and I'm a much more easygoing one, your two-star rating may be equal to my four-star rating. To compensate, an algorithm might try to detect when a Netflix customer tends to hand out only one- or two-star ratings -- a sign of a strict, pursed-lip customer -- and artificially boost his or her ratings by a half-star or so. Then there's the problem of movie raters who simply aren't consistent. They might be evenhanded most of the time, but if they log into Netflix when they're in a particularly bad mood, they might impulsively decide to rate a couple of dozen movies harshly.
 TV shows, which are hot commodities on Netflix, present yet another perplexing issue. Customers respond to TV series much differently than they do to movies. People who loved the first two seasons of ''The Wire'' might start getting bored during the third but keep on watching for a while, then stop abruptly. So when should Cinematch stop recommending ''The Wire''? When do you tell someone to give up on a TV show?
 Interestingly, the Netflix Prize competitors do not know anything about the demographics of the customers whose taste they're trying to predict. The teams sometimes argue on the discussion board about whether their predictions would be better if they knew that customer No. 465 is, for example, a 23-year-old woman in Arizona. Yet most of the leading teams say that personal information is not very useful, because it's too crude. As one team pointed out to me, the fact that I'm a 40-year-old West Village resident is not very predictive. There's little reason to think the other 40-year-old men on my block enjoy the same movies as I do. In contrast, the Netflix data are much more rich in meaning. When I tell Netflix that I think Woody Allen's black comedy ''Match Point'' deserves three stars but the Joss Whedon sci-fi film ''Serenity'' is a five-star masterpiece, this reveals quite a lot about my taste. Indeed, Reed Hastings told me that even though Netflix has a good deal of demographic information about its users, the company does not currently use it much to generate movie recommendations; merely knowing who people are, paradoxically, isn't very predictive of their movie tastes.
 As the teams have grown better at predicting human preferences, the more incomprehensible their computer programs have become, even to their creators. Each team has lined up a gantlet of scores of algorithms, each one analyzing a slightly different correlation between movies and users. The upshot is that while the teams are producing ever-more-accurate recommendations, they cannot precisely explain how they're doing this. Chris Volinsky admits that his team's program has become a black box, its internal logic unknowable.
 There's a sort of unsettling, alien quality to their computers' results. When the teams examine the ways that singular value decomposition is slotting movies into categories, sometimes it makes sense to them -- as when the computer highlights what appears to be some essence of nerdiness in a bunch of sci-fi movies. But many categorizations are now so obscure that they cannot see the reasoning behind them. Possibly the algorithms are finding connections so deep and subconscious that customers themselves wouldn't even recognize them. At one point, Chabbert showed me a list of movies that his algorithm had discovered share some ineffable similarity; it includes a historical movie, ''Joan of Arc,'' a wrestling video, ''W.W.E.: SummerSlam 2004,'' the comedy ''It Had to Be You'' and a version of Charles Dickens's ''Bleak House.'' For the life of me, I can't figure out what possible connection they have, but Chabbert assures me that this singular value decomposition scored 4 percent higher than Cinematch -- so it must be doing something right. As Volinsky surmised, ''They're able to tease out all of these things that we would never, ever think of ourselves.'' The machine may be understanding something about us that we do not understand ourselves.
 Yet it's clear that something is still missing. Volinsky's momentum has slowed down significantly, as everyone else's has. There's some X factor in human judgment that the current bunch of algorithms isn't capturing when it comes to movies like ''Napoleon Dynamite.'' And the problem looms large. Bertoni is currently at 8.8 percent; he says that a small group of mainly independent movies represents more than half of the remaining errors in the way of winning the prize. Most teams suspect that continuing to tweak existing algorithms won't be enough to get to 10 percent. They need another breakthrough -- some way to digitally replicate the love/hate dynamic that governs hard-to-pigeonhole indie films.
 ''This last half-percent really is the Mount Everest,'' Volinsky said. ''It's going to take one of these 'aha' moments.''
 SOME COMPUTER SCIENTISTS think the ''Napoleon Dynamite'' problem exposes a serious weakness of computers. They cannot anticipate the eccentric ways that real people actually decide to take a chance on a movie.
 The Cinematch system, like any recommendation engine, assumes that your taste is static and unchanging. The computer looks at all the movies you've rated in the past, finds the trend and uses that to guide you. But the reality is that our cultural tastes evolve, and they change in part because we interact with others. You hear your friends gushing about ''Mad Men,'' so eventually -- even though you have never had any particular interest in early-'60s America -- you give it a try. Or you go into the video store and run into a particularly charismatic clerk who persuades you that you really, really have to give ''The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou'' a chance.
 As Gavin Potter, a Netflix Prize competitor who lives in Britain and is currently in ninth place, pointed out to me, a computerized recommendation system seeks to find the common threads in millions of people's recommendations, so it inherently avoids extremes. Video-store clerks, on the other hand, are influenced by their own idiosyncrasies. Even if they're considering your taste to make a suitable recommendation, they can't help relying on their own sense of what's good and bad. They'll make more mistakes than the Netflix computers -- but they're also more likely to have flashes of inspiration, like pointing you to ''Napoleon Dynamite'' at just the right moment.
 ''If you use a computerized system based on ratings, you will tend to get very relevant but safe answers,'' Potter says. ''If you go with the movie-store clerk, you will get more unpredictable but potentially more exciting recommendations.''
 Another critic of computer recommendations is, oddly enough, Pattie Maes, the M.I.T. professor. She notes that there's something slightly antisocial -- ''narrow-minded'' -- about hyperpersonalized recommendation systems. Sure, it's good to have a computer find more of what you already like. But culture isn't experienced in solitude. We also consume shows and movies and music as a way of participating in society. That social need can override the question of whether or not we'll like the movie.
 ''You don't want to see a movie just because you think it's going to be good,'' Maes says. ''It's also because everyone at school or work is going to be talking about it, and you want to be able to talk about it, too.'' Maes told me that a while ago she rented a ''Sex and the City'' DVD from Netflix. She suspected she probably wouldn't really like the show. ''But everybody else was constantly talking about it, and I had to know what they were talking about,'' she says. ''So even though I would have been embarrassed if Netflix suggested 'Sex and the City' to me, I'm glad I saw it, because now I get it. I know all the in-jokes.''
 Maes suspects that in the future, computer-based reasoning will become less important for online retailers than social-networking tools that tap into the social zeitgeist, that let customers see, in Facebook fashion, for example, what their close friends are watching and buying. (Potter has an even more intriguing idea. He says he thinks that a recommendation system could predict cultural microtrends by monitoring news events. His research has found, for example, that people rent more movies about Wall Street when the stock market drops.) In the world of music, there are already several innovative recommendation services that try to analyze buzz -- by monitoring blogs for repeated mentions of up-and-coming bands, or by sifting through millions of people's playlists to see if a new band is suddenly getting a lot of attention.
 Of course, for a company like Netflix, there's a downside to pushing exciting-but-risky movie recommendations on viewers. If Netflix tries to stretch your taste by recommending more daring movies, it also risks annoying customers. A bad movie recommendation can waste an evening.
 Is there any way to find a golden mean? When I put the question to Reed Hastings, the Netflix C.E.O., he told me he suspects that there won't be any simple answer. The company needs better algorithms; it needs breakthrough techniques like singular value decomposition, with the brilliant but inscrutable insights it enables. But Hastings also says he thinks Maes is right, too, and that social-networking tools will become more useful. (Netflix already has one, in fact -- an application that lets users see what their family and peers are renting. But Hastings admits it hasn't been as valuable as computerized intelligence; only a very small percentage of rentals are driven by what friends have chosen.) Hastings is even considering hiring cinephiles to watch all 100,000 movies in the Netflix library and write up, by hand, pages of adjectives describing each movie, a cloud of tags that would offer a subjective view of what makes films similar or dissimilar. It might imbue Cinematch with more unpredictable, humanlike intelligence.
 ''Human beings are very quirky and individualistic, and wonderfully idiosyncratic,'' Hastings says. ''And while I love that about human beings, it makes it hard to figure out what they like.''

HEADLINE: Movie Losers Need Cars, Too

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEELE

 BODY:
IF by chance you weren't Googling ''Yugos for sale'' in early October, you probably missed the auction of the mustard-yellow hatchback featured prominently in the recent film ''Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist.'' The car -- one of three identical Yugos procured for the film's shoot -- sold on eBay last month for $2,600. 
 Granted, this is not exactly like owning Steve McQueen's Mustang from ''Bullitt,'' but in these austere times an aficionado has to take what he can get. 
 The Yugo was cast presumably to emphasize that Nick, played by Michael Cera, is not the coolest kid on the block. To put it more bluntly, the Yugo is a Losermobile. 
 (And, alas, now even more of a collector's item: on Nov. 11, the last Yugo rolled off the assembly line in Serbia. Sales of Yugos in the United States ended in 1992.)
 The ''Nick and Norah'' Yugo is not the first film car of less-than-noble heritage to be auctioned. Garth's AMC Pacer from the ''Wayne's World'' movies was sold in December 2004 by the Volo Auto Museum for nearly $16,000. And last month one of the three ''official'' versions of Ecto-1, the 1959 Cadillac Miller-Meteor ambulance made famous in ''Ghostbusters,'' was sold on eBay for $45,000. Who says we're in a recession?
 It's anyone's guess as to whether these cars were purchased out of sincere affection or to burnish someone's hipster credentials. Either way, I'm sure the cars make excellent conversation-starters. 
 So as long as Losermobiles are being put up for bids, what about Lloyd Dobler's blue Chevelle from ''Say Anything,'' perhaps with boom box included?

HEADLINE: Is Steel's Revival A Model for Detroit?

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, an industry whose history and mythology were indelible parts of the American identity was dying. The great steel mills of Pennsylvania and the Midwest had literally built this country, but the twin burdens of competition and self-inflicted wounds had brought them to the edge of extinction.
 If they were allowed to go under, their partisans warned, the consequences would ripple through the economy at a cost too high to bear. The old saying, ''As steel goes, so goes the nation,'' was as much a threat as a boast.
 The Detroit automakers are using the same argument as they seek a $25 billion bailout from Congress. ''What happens in the automotive industry affects each and every one of us,'' a General Motors Web site declares, warning that the consequences of a shutdown would be ''devastating.'' 
 Yet steel's savior was not the government bailouts it ardently sought but exactly what it so long tried to avoid: bankruptcy. Only when the companies failed were they successfully slimmed down and retooled into smaller but profitable ventures. As debate continues over what, if anything, should be done for G.M., Ford and Chrysler, the steel industry may offer a model.
 The steel and auto industries are both capital-intensive enterprises that peaked a half-century ago and have been intermittently embattled ever since. Both secured peace with their unions by vastly expanding benefits, a bargain that eventually hobbled them. Both had entrenched layers of management that believed -- despite all evidence -- they could wish away change.
 There are also key differences. Steel is essentially a straightforward commodity industry: the companies compete on price. Auto sales are often ruled by consumer perceptions. This has been a problem for Detroit. Many of its customers long ago fled for Toyota and Honda and a bankruptcy would scare away many more.
 The steel industry was beginning its long stumble when it turned to Washington for help in the late 1970s. The Carter administration responded by committing $300 million in loan guarantees to five struggling companies. Nearly a third of the funds went to help Wisconsin Steel, a Chicago outfit that had been around since the previous century.
 Thanks to a strike at a key customer, Wisconsin Steel promptly went under. The company locked its gates one winter day without even bothering to notify its 3,000 employees that their wages were history. So was most of the government's money.
 Despite this fiasco, Jimmy Carter's successors tried to deliver on demands for relief. In 1984, Ronald Reagan imposed import quotas to stem the tide of cheap foreign steel. In 1999, Bill Clinton guaranteed $1 billion in loans to beleaguered producers, and the following year imposed punitive tariffs on some imports.
 It was never enough, particularly after the rise of low-cost minimills. By late 2001, their industry reeling, the steel makers wanted more from Washington: further protection from imports; pressure on other countries to reduce their steel-making capacity; and billions of taxpayer dollars to relieve the burden of their employees' retirement costs.
 They got a temporary tariff from President Bush, but not much more. And so the steel industry -- what was left of it -- shuddered and collapsed.
 Bethlehem Steel, whose steel was used in the Hoover Dam, the Chrysler building and the George Washington Bridge, filed for bankruptcy in October 2001. It was followed by National Steel, Weirton Steel, Georgetown Steel and many others. The pain was great.
 And necessary, some say. ''If the steel companies had gotten all they wanted in terms of loan guarantees and import quotas, they would never have gotten better,'' said Richard Fruehan, director of the Sloan Study on Competitiveness in the Steel Industry. ''The bankruptcies forced their hand.''
 Over the decades the companies had shed employees to stay afloat. Soon retirees greatly outnumbered the actual workers. At Bethlehem, the ratio was six retirees for every worker. All these retirees had good pensions and good health care plans, which they thought were guaranteed. But these costs were a tremendous weight on the companies.
 Bankruptcy changed the rules, allowing the steel makers to unload billions of dollars in pension obligations onto the government's Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and to cut more than 200,000 workers from their supposedly guaranteed medical care.
 The failures also allowed for the renegotiation of labor contracts, something Wilbur L. Ross Jr., a specialist in distressed assets, realized when he began looking at the moribund industry. The only bidder for the bankrupt LTV Steel, he proceeded to buy Bethlehem and other old-line companies, putting them together as International Steel Group. He cut more employees and revamped work rules, taking Bethlehem, for example, from eight layers of management to three.
 Steel's turn-around was dramatic. The 17 leading companies went from a combined loss of $1.1 billion in 2003 to an after-tax profit of $6.6 billion in 2004, according to an analysis done for an industry trade group. Ross sold International Steel to the Indian entrepreneur Lakshmi Mittal for $4.5 billion in 2005, earning a tremendous return.
 Thanks to all of steel's tribulations and consolidations -- and, no doubt, a world economy that was booming until recently -- the industry is relatively healthy. 
 If only the car companies could get to this sweet spot. They assert they are chopping operating costs but need a lifeline in the form of the $25 billion in loans. G.M., the weakest of the three, says that without the money it will soon run out of cash to operate. Chrysler says it would not be far behind.
 The history of government bailouts, so often littered with disappointment, had a great success with a car company. Chrysler used its $1.5 billion in government loan guarantees in the early 1980s to stabilize itself and improve its product. The loans were paid off, with interest. That's a precedent the auto industry might be happy to discuss, as long as you didn't ask why Chrysler is once again pleading for government help.
 In a G.M. bankruptcy, the number of product lines would be reduced, the management replaced and the investors wiped out. The enormous costs of its retirees could be off-loaded. It would be painful, just as it was with steel, but in the end someone could come in and pick up the pieces. Perhaps it would be one of the foreign carmakers, looking to expand. Perhaps it would be a distressed assets specialist, like Wilbur Ross.
 Not so fast, said Mr. Ross. The investor who made a fortune off steel companies that were not bailed out is in favor of a G.M. bailout.
 Mr. Ross doesn't dispute that the auto companies are as bloated as the steel companies were, and certainly doesn't think they should get a blank check. But he thinks the consequences of what he calls free-fall bankruptcies -- ones without any government role -- could be disastrous. G.M. would drag hundreds of suppliers down with it, and they would all have trouble getting back up again.
 Furthermore, it's a tremendously problematic time. The final collapse of the steel industry came when the economy was relatively healthy and could absorb the blow. The current economy is the weakest in decades.
 ''Bankruptcy will be a total mess, and may not produce anything of value at the end of it,'' Mr. Ross said. Instead, he would like to see a 90-day government loan to keep G.M. afloat on the condition that all the stakeholders -- including employees, management, bond-holders -- agree on a restructuring. The government would be there essentially to crack heads and make sure everyone made concessions.
 This, however, would give the government ultimate responsibility for the death of G.M., should that come to pass. ''The government would have to have the fortitude to say, 'We're not going to keep pumping in money,' and mean it,'' Mr. Ross said.
 Would government regulators have such fortitude? Mr. Ross was uncertain but said if they didn't, ''they should hang their heads in shame.''

HEADLINE: Should a Subway Ride Cost More?

 BODY:
Squeezed by increasing costs and declining tax subsidies, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has proposed a 23 percent increase in fare and toll revenues, as well as budget cuts that include the elimination of two subway lines, many station booth closings and a reduction in off-peak service. The authority's board will vote on the increases in December, and they could take effect next June. Here is some background on transit costs. 

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Effective cost: How New York fares compare: By one way of calculating, New York City Transit riders paid 86 cents, on average, for each leg of a trip in 2007. That includes discounts. Transfers, whether between a bus and a subway, or from one subway line to another, are counted as a separate trip. CHARTS: Subsidies versus fares: Major transit systems receive a combination of fares and tax subsidies. Most are heavily subsidized to keep fares low. For subway and bus riders in New York, however, fares pay most of the cost.
M.T.A. wants to shift more to riders: The burden on riders -- especially subway users -- will grow substantially if the M.T.A. goes through with its plan, announced last week, to increase fare revenues by 23 percent.
A century of subway fares: With inflation factored in, the base mass transit fare of $2 in New York City is high by historic standards, about twice as much as riders paid in the 1960s.
Economies of scale: New York City Transit is by far the largest mass transit system in the country, carrying more passengers than the next nine combined.
Discounted fares: Thanks to the MetroCard, only a fraction of riders pay the base fare any more. Full-fare trips, using cash, tokens or single-fare cards, now account for less than 10 percent of fares.
Cost per ride drops: The result has been a decline in the cost of an average transit ride. This measure, compiled by the M.T.A., treats subway and bus rides as separate trips. With discounted fares, and free transfers between subways and buses since 1997, the average has fallen.
Ridership increase: Transit officials say the discounted fares and free transfers have helped to fuel growth in subway and bus use. Ridership grew by 25 percent between 1997 and 2002, but transit ridership is still below the levels seen in the 1960s. (Sources: Metropolitan Transportation Authority
 American Public Transportation Association) (CHARTS BY FORD FESSENDEN AND WILLIAM NEUMAN, THE NEW YORK TIMES) That scale, along with the city's density, help make New York's cost per passenger the lowest by far of any city. The main beneficiaries of the savings are state and city taxpayers, not transit riders.

HEADLINE: Football Helping to Give Prep School a National Name

BYLINE: By DAVE CALDWELL

 BODY:
RAMSEY
DON BOSCO PREPARATORY is a parochial high school in Bergen County with fewer than 1,000 students. Its football stadium has seats on only one side, there is no band, and the cheerleaders are from an all-girls school. But Don Bosco is a football powerhouse.
Its team, the Ironmen, improved its record to 8-1 on Nov. 14 in the first round of playoffs among the state's largest (Group IV) nonpublic schools. It was scheduled to play St. Peter's Prep of Jersey City on Friday in the state semifinal, in the hope of moving on to the championship game. 
But even as the high school's athletic teams, led by the football squad, are becoming known as among the best in New Jersey -- and in some cases the nation -- the school says its sports prowess has helped attract more students and raise its academic standards even higher.
When John Stanczak became the principal at Don Bosco five years ago, about 900 boys applied for 250 spots in the freshman class. This year, he said, the number of applicants has risen to 1,200. ''We don't need to go out to beat the bushes to find a kid,'' he said.
Students must take an entrance examination administered by the archbishop of Newark. ''The irony of the situation is that as our football team has gotten better, it's become more difficult to get into'' the school, said Greg Toal, who has been the football coach at Don Bosco for 10 years, after a recent practice.
Don Bosco traditionally has nationally ranked programs in football, baseball and cross-country, but it continues to emphasize academics. And not every Don Bosco football player aspires to play major-college football. Brett Knief, the senior quarterback, has accepted an athletic scholarship to the University of North Carolina, where he intends to play baseball and probably major in finance.
Stanczak said, ''Some of our detractors talk about Don Bosco being an athletic factory, being a football factory, and nothing can be farther from the truth.''
This year its team has played games in Ohio and Northern California, where in September it stunned perennial power De La Salle High School, 23-21, before a crowd of 6,500 in Concord.
ESPNU televised the game, the expenses for which were paid by gate receipts and a dinner honoring the Green Bay Packers running back Ryan Grant, a Don Bosco alumnus. The victory generated even greater interest in Don Bosco.
''It gives our program a lot of exposure -- people heard we were from North Jersey, so it let people know who we are,'' said Jack Templeton, a 260-pound senior lineman who said he would like to major in business or economics at an Ivy League school.
As Toal and Stanczak explained it, Don Bosco added the high-profile out-of-state games -- which included a season-opening loss to St. Xavier High School of Cincinnati on Sept. 12 -- because it was looking for new ways to improve. Why not go national?
''We'd rather challenge ourselves -- challenge the kids, more important -- and our schedule in the last three or four years wasn't really giving us the opportunity to do that,'' said Nunzio Campanile, the athletic director and offensive coordinator for the football team. ''I don't think lopsided games are good for anybody.''
De La Salle was asked to play at Don Bosco a few years ago, but a date could not be arranged. Campanile looked for another national opponent, and then the schools' paths crossed again when both played in a 2006 football showcase in Ohio.
This year's game was arranged in May. The Ironmen flew to California and spent three days in a hotel. The players said that preparing for the game left them little time to see the Bay Area. But the Ironmen prevailed on a last-second field goal.
''De La Salle -- they're a dynasty,'' said Knief, the Don Bosco quarterback. ''They've had books written about them. But we have a reputation around here. Our reputation is that we're tough. We're not going to break.''
The victory pushed the Ironmen into the Top 20 of several national polls, and the players said they enjoyed the trip, even though many had to study on the flights to and from the game. It was a taste of what a college team encounters.
''It was a weird feeling,'' Templeton said. ''Everybody was watching us on TV, and they said it was like they were watching a big-time college football game.''
Joe Romain, whose son, Dillon, is a senior running back for Don Bosco, said they had already been approached by college recruiters. ''The exposure was unbelievable,'' Mr. Romain said.

HEADLINE: A Rewired Bully Pulpit: Big, Bold and Unproven

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
 ROUGHLY 10 million of Barack Obama's closest friends and supporters began opening their e-mail in-boxes last Tuesday to find a message from his campaign manager, David Plouffe, labeled ''Where we go from here.'' In it, Mr. Plouffe asked backers to ''help shape the future of this movement'' by clicking to an online survey, which in turn asked them to rank four priorities in order of importance.
 First on the list: ''Helping Barack's administration pass legislation through grassroots efforts.''
 After a campaign that Facebooked, Twittered, texted and YouTubed its way to victory, the message was no surprise. It is now fashionable in Washington to talk about how Mr. Obama will transfer his technological tricks from the campaign trail to the White House, and use his impressive social networking skills to rally support for an ambitious agenda. 
 Not since Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats, the theory goes, will the presidential platform -- the ''bully pulpit,'' as another Roosevelt, Theodore, called it -- have such power. 
 ''Since the days that Teddy Roosevelt created the bully pulpit, our most memorable presidents have been those who mastered these new forms of communication: Roosevelt himself with modern newspapers; Franklin Roosevelt with the radio; Kennedy and Reagan with television,'' said David Gergen, a longtime communications strategist who has worked for several presidents, including Mr. Reagan. ''Now Barack Obama has the potential of being the first Internet president, in all of its full glory.''
 The question is whether that ''full glory'' is necessarily a better bully pulpit.
 It is one thing to run a movement, filled with passion and an army of true believers set on a single goal, and another to run a country, where competing agendas are often fueled by deep divisions. And while the communications stars do seem to be aligned for Mr. Obama, historians, political scientists and strategists say that being the first Internet president poses its own challenges. The Internet, after all, is a two-way medium, and the bully pulpit is inherently one-way.
 ''I don't think there's any doubt that he will use nontraditional venues for taking his case to the people, and that's all fine, but it's still going to be a rough ride,'' said George C. Edwards III, a political scientist at Texas A&M University and the author of ''On Deaf Ears: The Limits of the Bully Pulpit.'' ''There's a great myth out there about the bully pulpit. Presidents can rarely move public opinion, and that's true across all presidents at all times.'' 
 To begin with, it can be difficult to command attention; even F.D.R. had trouble. Despite the popular impression that Americans spent the Roosevelt era riveted to their radios, Mr. Edwards cites a poll in April 1939 that found 37 percent of the public had never listened to the fireside chats, 39 percent said they listened only sometimes, while 24 percent said they usually listened.
 Presidents tend to believe their powers of persuasion can sell the public on their ideas. Mr. Reagan, ''the great communicator,'' lamented that he was unable to persuade Americans to pursue United States intervention in Central America. Bill Clinton, reflecting on the failure of his health care plan, wrote, ''I got caught up in the parliamentary aspect of the presidency, and I missed the leadership, bully pulpit function which is so critical.'' 
 Mr. Edwards argues that this concept of the bully pulpit is ''a very simple-minded theory.'' He says presidents can use their platform to reinforce a public predisposition, but rarely can they use it to advance a controversial agenda. 
 Mr. Obama will face all the obstacles that any incoming president faces, and then some. He was elected with 53 percent of the vote; that means 47 percent of Americans did not support him -- and they may be clicking on a few Web sites of their own. He may have trouble working his will with Congress, as Mr. Clinton did, even with Democrats in charge. Meanwhile, the federal deficit is spiraling, perhaps making it harder to sell expensive programs like universal health care.
 ''He can give the best speeches in the world and have everybody knock on doors,'' said Julian Zelizer, a historian at Princeton, ''but if Treasury doesn't have much to use, it's going to be a big problem.''
 The question for Mr. Obama is whether by using social networking to reach people directly in a way that television and radio could not, he can harness the power of the Internet to overcome such obstacles. He begins with a bully pulpit that, in the traditional sense, is in excellent working order. After eight years of a president whose rhetorical style consisted of making jokes about his ineloquence, Mr. Obama can trade on his charisma and striking gift for oratory. In a time of grave economic crisis, when Americans are hungry for comfort from their leader, he has the public's ear.
 He also has something more: an impressive database of supporters, and a knack for circumventing the traditional media by putting his message directly on YouTube, as he did recently when he talked about climate change and , when he recorded the Democratic ''radio'' address.
 ''It's really about reaching an extra person or a larger audience of people who wouldn't normally pay attention to policy,'' said Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for Mr. Obama's transition team. ''We have to think creatively about how we would do that in the White House, because promoting a speech in front of 100,000 people is certainly different than promoting energy legislation.''
 How he will use these tools now is not yet clear. One decision the Obama political team is facing is what to do with the database. Does Mr. Obama keep control of it, using it to direct his army of supporters to flood Congress with e-mail messages to help ''Barack's administration pass legislation,'' as Mr. Plouffe's e-mail suggests?
 Or does he share it with the Democratic National Committee for broader use by all Democrats seeking elective office? (No. 2. on Mr. Plouffe's list of possible priorities: ''Helping elect state and local candidates who share the same vision for our country.'') 
 Andrew Rasiej, the founder of Tech President, a blog that tracked how the 2008 presidential candidates used the Web, says the database will inevitably enhance Mr. Obama's bully pulpit. ''He created his own special interest group,'' Mr. Rasiej said, ''because the same people that made phone calls on behalf of him are now going to be calling or e-mailing their congressman.'' 
 Inside the transition White House, meanwhile, Mr. Obama's aides are weighing just how interactive the new president can be. Will he host Internet news conferences on WhiteHouse.gov, allowing the public to e-mail questions or propose topics for his State of the Union speech? The first rule of White House communications strategy is that the president must keep control of his message, but the first rule of the Internet is freedom to dissent. Advocates like Ellen Miller of the Sunlight Foundation, which promotes government openness, are talking about wikis, online collaborative chats and comment boards moderated by the White House.
 ''He showed his sophisticated use of technology in the context of the campaign,'' Ms. Miller said. ''Nothing less than that is expected in engaging citizens in collaborative government.'' 
 Already, there are hints of conflict. Candidate Obama was open enough to allow his supporters to wage an online revolt -- on his own MyBarackObama.com Web site -- over his vote in favor of legislation granting legal immunity to telecommunications firms that participated in the Bush administration's domestic wiretapping program. But President-elect Obama did not provide a forum for comments on his YouTube radio address, prompting grumbling among some in the netroots crowd, Ms. Miller among them, that YouTube without comments was no different from radio. 
 For Mr. Obama, the challenge in rewiring the bully pulpit is to keep the netroots crowd with him as he employs both his natural communication gifts and his technological savvy in service to his legislative agenda. How it turns out will determine whether the Internet candidate really does become the Internet president.

HEADLINE: Obama Vows Swift Action On Vast Stimulus Package

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES and JEFF ZELENY; Carl Hulse and Mark Landler contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama signaled on Saturday that he would pursue a far more ambitious plan of spending and tax cuts than anything he outlined on the campaign trail, setting the tone for a recovery effort that could absorb and define much of his term.
 In the Democrats' weekly radio address, Mr. Obama said he would direct his economic team to craft a two-year stimulus plan with the goal of saving or creating 2.5 million jobs. He said it would be ''a plan big enough to meet the challenges we face.'' 
 Mr. Obama said he hoped to sign the stimulus package into law soon after taking office on Jan. 20. He is already coordinating efforts with Democratic leaders in Congress, who have said they will begin work next month.
 Advisers to Mr. Obama say they want to use the economic crisis as an opportunity to act on many of the issues he emphasized in his campaign, including cutting taxes for lower- and middle-class workers, addressing neglected public infrastructure projects like roads and schools, and creating ''green jobs'' through business incentives for energy alternatives and environmentally friendly technologies. 
 In light of the downturn, Mr. Obama is also said to be reconsidering a key campaign pledge: his proposal to repeal the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. According to several people familiar with the discussions, he might instead let those tax cuts expire as scheduled in 2011, effectively delaying any tax increase while he gives his stimulus plan a chance to work.
 ''The news this week has only reinforced the fact that we are facing an economic crisis of historic proportions,'' Mr. Obama said in his address. ''We now risk falling into a deflationary spiral that could increase our massive debt even further.''
 His address, a video of which was made available on YouTube, was part of an effort to calm financial markets roiled by the failure of an outgoing president and a lame-duck Congress to come up with a plan to lift the economy and restore investor confidence. 
 On Monday, Mr. Obama plans to introduce his economic team, starting with his Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner. News that Mr. Geithner, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, would get the job helped send the stock market up by nearly 500 points on Friday after days of sharp losses.
 Former Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers is to be the director of the National Economic Council in the White House, the president's principal economic adviser and policy coordinator, according to an Obama aide. 
 The economic team will also include Peter R. Orszag, the head of the Congressional Budget Office, who will be the next White House budget director.
 Mr. Summers, who served as a campaign adviser to Mr. Obama, has advocated for a forceful stimulus plan in recent newspaper columns, saying the federal government should be doing more, not less, in areas like health care, energy, education and tax relief. Mr. Obama seemed to echo those thoughts in his radio address.
 ''We'll be working out the details in the weeks ahead,'' Mr. Obama said, ''but it will be a two-year, nationwide effort to jumpstart job creation in America and lay the foundation for a strong and growing economy. We'll put people back to work rebuilding our crumbling roads and bridges, modernizing schools that are failing our children, and building wind farms and solar panels, fuel-efficient cars and the alternative energy technologies that can free us from our dependence on foreign oil and keep our economy competitive in the years ahead.''
 Mr. Obama's announcement came after market declines and the prospect of a collapse by automakers and other storied companies had sparked growing criticism last week that he was sitting on the sidelines. 
 Although advisers say they have not begun to fill in the details, Mr. Obama's proposal would go beyond the $175 billion stimulus plan he proposed in October. That included a $3,000 tax credit to employers for each new hire above their current work force and billions in aid to states and cities. 
 Separately, Democratic leaders in Congress have been calling for a robust economic recovery initiative of up to $300 billion, including major investments in infrastructure to create jobs. President Bush has refused to consider a package so large, but even some conservative economists have said $300 billion is the minimum needed to spur the economy.
 ''There are no quick or easy fixes to this crisis, which has been many years in the making,'' Mr. Obama said Saturday. ''And it's likely to get worse before it gets better. 
 ''But January 20th is our chance to begin anew, with a new direction, new ideas and new reforms that will create jobs and fuel long-term economic growth.''
 Some Republicans might be won over should Mr. Obama decide not to repeal the Bush tax cuts for those making more than $250,000. By simply letting the cuts expire after 2010, as the law now provides, Mr. Obama would in effect delay the tax increase that high-income taxpayers would have faced in the next year or two under his original plan.
 That could have economic and political benefits. Mr. Obama would not be open to the charge from Republicans and other critics that he is raising taxes in a recession, which many believe is counterproductive. His Republican presidential rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona, had raised that argument during the campaign.
 By letting the tax cuts expire, Mr. Obama would get the benefit of higher revenues in 2011 and beyond to help finance his promised health care plans without having to propose raising taxes on the affluent and without the Democratic majority in Congress having to take a vote on a tax increase.
 Also, Mr. Obama is under far less pressure in the short term to raise revenues to help finance campaign promises because the seriousness of the economic crisis has brought bipartisan agreement that the government must do whatever it can to spur economic growth. 
 Mr. Bush and the Republicans who controlled Congress in 2001 agreed that his tax cuts would expire after 10 years as a way of minimizing the projected revenue losses in future years, to comply with Congressional budget rules and to help pass the legislation. The president repeatedly called for making the tax cuts permanent, but no action was taken.
 The 2.5 million jobs that Mr. Obama promises to save or create over two years is a gross number. With about 1.2 million jobs lost this year, and more projected to be lost in 2009, Obama advisers expect that job losses will outnumber new jobs next year. For 2010, the advisers are projecting the reverse if Mr. Obama's plans become law. 
 Nearly every spending program and tax cut that Mr. Obama proposed during the campaign could well end up in the stimulus package, advisers indicated. For example, Mr. Obama's proposals to invest in energy alternatives and advanced ''green'' technologies will most likely be part of the package, rather than proposed later in his administration.
 In effect, the stimulus will be seen by the Obama administration as ''a down payment,'' as one adviser put it, on Mr. Obama's entire domestic platform, allowing him to try to take maximum advantage of the first year of his presidency. Traditionally, the first year is the one in which modern presidents have achieved most of their major victories. 
 Some economists welcomed Mr. Obama's plan, though they said it was difficult to assess without full details. The focus on creating and saving jobs made sense, they said, given the deterioration of the job market. 
 ''The unemployment rate is soaring,'' possibly into the double digits, said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard. 
 The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said in a statement, ''We will soon finally have a leader and partner in the White House who recognizes the urgency with which we must turn around our economy, and I look forward to working with him and the new Congress to do so.''
 Republicans in the next Congress could still block a big stimulus package in the Senate, as Mr. Obama seemed to recognize. 
 ''I know that passing this plan won't be easy,'' Mr. Obama said. ''I will need and seek support from Republicans and Democrats, and I'll be welcome to ideas and suggestions from both sides of the aisle.
 ''But what is not negotiable is the need for immediate action.''

HEADLINE: The Price of Our Good Name

 BODY:
Americans have watched in horror as President Bush has trampled on the Bill of Rights and the balance of power. The list of abuses that President-elect Barack Obama must address is long: once again require the government to get warrants to eavesdrop on Americans; undo scores of executive orders and bill-signing statements that have undermined the powers of Congress; strip out the unnecessary invasions of privacy embedded in the Patriot Act; block new F.B.I. investigative guidelines straight out of J. Edgar Hoover's playbook.
 Those are not the only disasters Mr. Obama will inherit. He will have to rescue a drowning economy, restore regulatory sanity to the financial markets and extricate the country from an unnecessary war in Iraq so it can focus on a necessary war in Afghanistan. 
 Even with all those demands, there is one thing Mr. Obama must do quickly to begin to repair this nation's image and restore its self-respect: announce a plan for closing Mr. Bush's outlaw prison at Guantanamo Bay. 
 The prison is the premier example of the disdain shown by Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney for the Constitution, federal law and international treaties. Most sensible governments cannot see past Guantanamo to even recall America's long history as a defender of human rights and democratic values.
 We are under no illusions. Closing the prison will not be easy, or quick, but it can be done. It does not mean that the United States will set free heinous terrorists. But it may mean that these prisoners will have to be tried on other very serious charges than the ones supposedly for which they were sent to Guantanamo. 
 That is Mr. Bush's fault. His decision to authorize the torture of detainees has made it highly unlikely that the evidence collected at Gitmo and the C.I.A.'s illegal prisons around the world would stand up in a real court.
 In closing down Guantanamo, there are some basic requirements: The prisoners must be dealt with as openly as possible. Those who are charged here must stand trial in federal courts, not the tribunals created by the disastrous Military Commissions Act of 2006. 
 It would compound the disaster if, as some suggest, Congress tried to create a new system combining military and civilian justice. We have seen what happens when the government creates special systems to deal with special classes of prisoners.
 Human Rights Watch has offered a good template for closing Guantanamo. It includes: 
 SET A DATE TO CLOSE THE PRISON That announcement would send a powerful signal that the new administration has rejected Mr. Bush's abusive and unlawful policies. It would make other countries more likely to cooperate. The taint of Guantanamo is so great that right now even close allies will not consider resettling prisoners who should be set free because they committed no crimes of any kind. There may be at least 60 of these detainees at Gitmo. Selected countries might also be willing to take back their own nationals to stand trial.
 BEGIN A TRANSPARENT REVIEW OF DETAINEES There are about 250 detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Human Rights Watch sensibly proposes creating a task force run by the Justice Department with input from the Departments of State and Defense and the director of national intelligence to separate out those who may be truly guilty of terrorist acts -- a minority -- from the larger population who either committed much more minor crimes or no crimes at all.
 REPATRIATE DETAINEES WHO ARE NOT TO BE TRIEDThis must be done carefully. There are believed to be 30 to 50 detainees from places like Algeria and Libya who have justified fears of being abused or tortured if they are sent home. The Obama administration should provide these prisoners with advance notice of plans to repatriate them and give them a chance to contest those plans.
 Prisoners with a credible fear of abuse cannot be sent to that fate. They will have to be sent to other countries to live. The best way for the United States to get other governments to cooperate is to accept some detainees for settlement in this country.
 TRY THE REST IN FEDERAL COURTS Americans will hear from former members of the Bush administration and supporters of its system of injustice that the federal courts cannot handle these cases because they involve sensitive secrets, or that terrorism is not appropriately handled as a law-enforcement issue. 
 Since Sept. 11, 2001, the federal courts have successfully prosecuted about 100 terrorism cases, and the courts deal routinely with national secrets. The real reason Mr. Bush and his team avoided the federal courts for the Gitmo detainees was that the evidence in so many of these cases is wafer-thin or unusable because it was obtained through coercion and torture.
 The world saw more proof of that last week, when Col. Stephen Henley, a military judge at Guantanamo, refused to admit evidence obtained through torture or coercion at the trial of Mohammed Jawad, an Afghan national who is one of the few prisoners at Guantanamo who has been charged and put on trial. Evidence that cannot pass muster in Guantanamo's kangaroo courts is certainly not going to be admitted by a civilian judge in a duly constituted court of law. 
 The Jawad case has become emblematic of everything that is wrong with Guantanamo Bay: he was captured in Afghanistan at the age of 16 or 17 and thrown into indefinite detention without hope of eventual release because he allegedly threw a grenade at two American servicemen and an Afghan interpreter. The prosecutor resigned in September, saying he could not ethically proceed, and the judge threw out Mr. Jawad's confession because it had been tortured out of him by Afghan interrogators. 
 Does this mean that truly dangerous men will be set free, to go back to plotting more attacks against America? No. But it will require smart legal thinking by the new administration.
 Take the case of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. It is obvious that the confession he made to plotting the 9/11 bombings will not hold up in court. It was obtained through torture. But this prisoner is a suspect in numerous other terrorist attacks, including the murder of the journalist Daniel Pearl and the attack on the U.S.S. Cole. There is an existing 1996 indictment against him for a plot to blow up 12 United States-bound commercial airliners. The evidence in that case was obtained, we presume, legally.
 It may be that compromises of this kind will have to be made in other cases as well. It is understandable that some Americans will find that less than satisfying. But it is important to remember that this is the price of Mr. Bush's incompetent and lawless conduct of the war against terrorism. It is a price worth paying to restore the rule of law and this country's good name.

HEADLINE: Billionaire Offers Arts Bailout in Los Angeles

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
Eli Broad, the billionaire philanthropist who is one of this city's biggest arts patrons, has offered $30 million to help rescue the financially beleaguered Museum of Contemporary Art if the museum's trustees and other patrons also step up their donations. 
 The offer, made in an op-ed article published Saturday in The Los Angeles Times, is the first concrete proposal to be made public since the museum disclosed this week that it was facing a financial crisis. The museum's endowment has fallen as much as 75 percent from its high several years ago, to less than $10 million, as the museum has repeatedly dipped into its permanent funds to pay for operations, said people who had been briefed on the museum's finances but who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the situation.
 In the article, Mr. Broad said that his Broad Art Foundation would invest $30 million ''with the expectation that the museum's board and others join in this effort to solve the institution's financial problems.''
 A spokeswoman for the museum said officials there would not immediately comment on the offer. People close to the museum said that Mr. Broad had discussed the potential contribution with museum officials this week and expressed his opinion that a management change was necessary. He did not outline any such conditions in the article.
 Mr. Broad was a founding chairman of the Museum of Contemporary Art in 1979 and he helped to negotiate the acquisition in 1994 of what became the centerpiece of the museum's highly regarded collection of post-World War II art, the Panza Collection. 
 But he has been largely inactive there recently, turning his attention to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which in February opened the Broad Contemporary Art Museum, a $56 million facility that Mr. Broad paid for and to which he donated another $10 million for art acquisitions.
 Mr. Broad implied in the article that his offer was contingent on the Museum of Contemporary Art remaining independent. When the museum's board met this week to discuss possible solutions to its crisis, among the ideas explored was the possibility of merging with another institution, people who were briefed on the meetings said.
 ''Being merged into another institution would destroy the fabric of a great museum and would sacrifice the independent curatorial vision that has created an extraordinary collection and many unparalleled exhibitions,'' Mr. Broad wrote.
 He also warned against the museum selling any of its collection. ''The greatest travesty to come out of MOCA's current financial crisis would be for it to sell any of its artworks to cover operating deficits -- an action that would be anathema for a museum,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Former Treasury Secretary To Lead Economic Council

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
President-elect Barack Obama is expected to name Lawrence H. Summers as his pick to head the National Economic Council, an aide to Mr. Obama said Saturday.
 The position is considered one of the top three economic posts in the administration, along with Treasury secretary and budget director. The economic council was created during the Clinton administration, and the director's job is to serve as a coordinator of economic policies and the conduit to the president on domestic and global economic issues. The director is also charged with monitoring implementation of the president's economic agenda. 
 Mr. Summers, 53, a former chief economist at the World Bank and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, served as Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration from 1999 to 2001. After leaving government in 2001, he was president of Harvard for five years but resigned after clashing with faculty over his remarks suggesting that women lack the intrinsic aptitude for math and science. 
 Also on Saturday, Mr. Obama named his top press staff, retaining a key campaign strategist as press secretary and tapping an ardent supporter of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York to direct communications.
 Robert Gibbs is set to become the face of the White House as the press secretary. Mr. Gibbs, 37, has been working with Mr. Obama since 2004, including stints as his campaign's communications director, and later a top strategist. Mr. Gibbs has built a reputation as an aggressive defender of his boss, and though his temperament contrasts with Mr. Obama's cool style, he is exceptionally close to the president-elect.
 Ellen Moran, 42, the executive director of Emily's List, is Mr. Obama's surprise choice to lead the communications operation. Emily's List, which supports female candidates who favor abortion rights, campaigned for Mrs. Clinton during the Democratic primary -- its first direct foray into presidential politics. However, after Mrs. Clinton's concession in June, the group quickly shifted gears to support Mr. Obama, and his campaign manager met with Ms. Moran and Ellen R. Malcolm, the founder of Emily's List, within weeks. 
 Although former Clinton supporters are likely to be happy with the choice, ''I don't think there's a lot of that kind of political calculus in it,'' said Ramona Oliver, who recently became communications director at the Service Employees International Union after five years at Emily's List. 
 ''She picks good people; she gives them room to be successful,'' Ms. Oliver said of Ms. Moran.
 Mr. Obama also named Daniel H. Pfieffer as his deputy communications director. Mr. Pfieffer, 32, was a spokesman during the campaign and is the communications director for the transition.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 25, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about appointments by President-elect Barack Obama misspelled the surname of the man he named deputy director of communications. He is Daniel H. Pfeiffer, not Pfieffer.

HEADLINE: The Pakistan Test

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF. 
Frank Rich is off today.

DATELINE: Islamabad, Pakistan 

 BODY:
 Barack Obama's most difficult international test in the next year will very likely be here in Pakistan. A country with 170 million people and up to 60 nuclear weapons may be collapsing.
 Reporting in Pakistan is scarier than it has ever been. The major city of Peshawar is now controlled in part by the Taliban, and this month alone in the area an American aid worker was shot dead, an Iranian diplomat kidnapped, a Japanese journalist shot and American humvees stolen from a NATO convoy to Afghanistan.
 I've been coming to Pakistan for 26 years, ever since I hid on the tops of buses to sneak into tribal areas as a backpacking university student, and I've never found Pakistanis so gloomy. Some worry that militants, nurtured by illiteracy and a failed education system, will overrun the country or that the nation will break apart. I'm not quite that pessimistic, but it's very likely that the next major terror attack in the West is being planned by extremists here in Pakistan. 
 ''There is real fear about the future,'' notes Ahmed Rashid, whose excellent new book on Pakistan and Afghanistan is appropriately titled ''Descent Into Chaos.''
 The United States has squandered more than $10 billion on Pakistan since 9/11, and Pakistani intelligence agencies seem to have rerouted some of that to Taliban extremists. American forces periodically strike militants in the tribal areas, but people from those areas overwhelmingly tell me that these strikes just antagonize tribal leaders and make them more supportive of the Taliban.
 One man described seeing Pashtuns in tribal areas throwing rocks in helpless frustration at the American aircraft flying overhead.
 President Asif Ali Zardari seems overwhelmed by the challenges and locked in the past. Incredibly, he has just chosen for his new cabinet two men who would fit fine in a Taliban government.
 One new cabinet member, Israr Ullah Zehri, defended the torture-murder of five women and girls who were buried alive (three girls wanted to choose their own husbands, and two women tried to protect them). ''These are centuries-old traditions, and I will continue to defend them,'' Mr. Zehri said of the practice of burying independent-minded girls alive.
 Then there is Pakistan's new education minister, Mir Hazar Khan Bijarani. Last year, the Supreme Court ordered him arrested for allegedly heading a local council that decided to solve a feud by taking five little girls and marrying them to men in an enemy clan. The girls were between the ages of 2 and 5, according to Samar Minallah, a Pakistani anthropologist who investigated the case (Mr. Bijarani has denied involvement).
 While there are no easy solutions for the interlinked catastrophes unfolding in Pakistan and Afghanistan, there are several useful steps that we in the West can take to reduce the risk of the region turning into the next Somalia. 
 First, we should slow the financial flow to Pakistan's government and military. If the government wants to stop the Talibanization of Pakistan, its greatest need isn't money but the political will to stop sheltering Taliban leaders in the city of Quetta.
 Second, we should cut tariffs on Pakistani agricultural and manufactured products to boost the economy and provide jobs. We should also support China on its planned export-processing zone to create manufacturing jobs in Pakistan. 
 Third, we should push much harder for a peace deal in Kashmir -- including far more pressure on India -- because Kashmir grievances empower Pakistani militants.
 Fourth, let's focus on education. One reason the country is such a mess today is that half of all Pakistanis are illiterate.
 In the southern Punjab a couple of days ago, I dropped in on a rural elementary school where only one teacher had bothered to show up that day. He was teaching the entire student body under a tree, in part because the school doesn't have desks for the first three grades. 
 One happy note: I visited a school run by a California-based aid group, Developments in Literacy, which represents a successful American effort to fight extremism. DIL is financed largely by Pakistani-Americans trying to ''give back,'' and it runs 150 schools in rural Pakistan, teaching girls in particular. 
 Tauseef Hyat, the Islamabad-based executive director of DIL, notes that originally the plan was to operate just primary schools, but then a group of 11-year-old girls threatened to go on hunger strike unless DIL helped them continue their education in high school. Ms. Hyat caved, and some of those girls are now studying to become doctors.
 Mr. Obama should make his first presidential trip to Pakistan -- and stop at a DIL school to remind Pakistan's army and elites that their greatest enemy isn't India but illiteracy.

HEADLINE: A Wartime Presidency, On Two Fronts

BYLINE: By ANTHONY H. CORDESMAN. 
Anthony H. Cordesman is a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 BARACK OBAMA will take office having campaigned that he would fight the war on terrorism by focusing on winning the war in Afghanistan and eliminating Al Qaeda's and the Taliban's sanctuary in Pakistan. He recognizes that these two countries have become the center of Al Qaeda's activities and of the violent Islamist extremism that challenges the real values of Islam. He also promised he would find the best way to withdraw from Iraq, and to create a new balance of security in the Persian Gulf.
 He has less than two months to go from broad rhetoric to concrete day-to-day action. On Jan. 20, he will take over at a pivotal point in negotiating Iraq's status of force agreement with the United States, in the middle of a winter military campaign in Afghanistan, and during a political, security and economic crisis in Pakistan. None of these issues will wait for America to deal with its financial problems. And no one involved believes that the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan's northern territories can be fully won, or even transferred to Afghan and Pakistani hands, by even the end of President Obama's first term. For at least the next two to three years, the war will intensify, and virtually all of the additional burden will be borne by the United States. 
 Leaks of a new National Intelligence Estimate have shown that we are now losing the war for several reasons: a lack of Afghan competence; a half-hearted Pakistani commitment to the fight; a shortage of American, NATO and International Security Assistance Force troops; too few aid workers; and nation-building programs that were designed for peacetime and are rife with inefficiency and fraud. This is why Gen. David McKiernan, the top commander in Afghanistan, and other military leaders have called for 20,000 to 25,000 more troops and warned that even those reinforcements may not be adequate. 
 Even with a potential drawdown in Iraq, the military is being stretched ever thinner. The Army already extends the deployment of troops beyond their commitments, and it and the Marine Corps may well find it impossible to meet their goals for shortening deployment cycles. As things stand, it will almost certainly take until 2011 to bring enough military advisers into Afghanistan to train its army and police forces to the level where locals can replace international troops. And with increasing terrorist attacks on non-governmental groups, many aid workers are being forced to leave the country. 
 The Afghan and Pakistani economies have effectively collapsed, and Afghans face food shortages this winter. Monthly spending on operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan will likely rise to as much as $5 billion, from around $2 billion today, or we will face defeat. 
 Even if the United States fully withdraws from Iraq in 2011, as Mr. Obama and the Iraqi government say they would like, we will remain on something very like a war footing there throughout the next presidency. While the combat burden on our forces will decline, withdrawal will be as costly as fighting. It will take large amounts of luck (and patient American prodding) for the Iraqi government to move toward real political accommodation while avoiding new explosions of ethnic and sectarian violence. 
 Even with progress on those fronts, we will have to withdraw while still helping to win a war, contain internal violence, limit Iranian influence and counter its nuclear program, create effective Iraqi security forces, and help Iraq improve its governance. Not a full war perhaps, but at least a quarter war in terms of continuing strains on our military and budget. 
 Moreover, the best case for the Iraq war means coming to grips with the legacy of the worst secretary of defense in American history, Donald Rumsfeld. In spite of recent progress under Defense Secretary Robert Gates, Mr. Rumsfeld's inability to manage any key aspect of defense modernization has left the Obama administration a legacy of unfunded and expensive new trade-offs between replacing combat-worn equipment, repairing and rehabilitating huge amounts of weapons and equipment, and supplying our forces with new, improved equipment. 
 At best, President Obama will have to conduct the equivalent of one-and-a-quarter wars throughout his first term. At worst? The outside chance of war with Iran as well.

8 P.M. (13, 49) NATURE: THE WOLF THAT CHANGED AMERICA In 1893 Ernest Thompson Seton, right, an animal trapper and naturalist, traveled into the canyons of New Mexico on a mission to kill a wolf called Lobo, the leader of a cattle-killing pack. Known as the King of Currumpaw, Lobo had a mythical ability to cheat death, and after eventually trapping Lobo, Seton found he couldn't kill him. Lobo ultimately died from his injuries, and Seton returned east, recording his findings in the book ''Wild Animals I Have Known'' and using his popularity to push for the creation of national parks and lay the groundwork for the Boy Scouts of America. ''Ever since Lobo,'' Seton said, ''my sincerest wish has been to impress upon people that each of our native wild creatures is in itself a precious heritage that we have no right to destroy or put beyond the reach of our children.''

HEADLINE: $9 Million Fund Will Invest in Green Start-Up Companies

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE STUART

DATELINE: Hartford 

 BODY:
 STATE officials want Connecticut to be known for more than just its fuel cell industry. They want it to become a hub for all kinds of green technology jobs. 
 Toward that end, Gov. M. Jodi Rell has announced the creation of a $9 million fund that will make investments in seed companies focused on innovations that conserve energy and resources, protect the environment or eliminate harmful waste.
 The fund will be called the Connecticut Clean Tech Fund, and it will be administered by Connecticut Innovations, the state's quasi-public authority responsible for technology investing and innovation development. 
 ''We want to position the state to be in the right place at the right time,'' Mrs. Rell said in an interview at the State Capitol on Monday. ''Connecticut is poised to do that, but we're not alone.''
 The governor said competition for clean technology jobs was growing and she wanted Connecticut to be ahead of the curve. 
 Peter Longo, president and executive director of Connecticut Innovations, said: ''Connecticut is already the fuel cell capital of the world. We want to build off that.''
 In a telephone interview, Mr. Longo said that for the past 20 years Connecticut Innovations has been investing in new technology and fields where others are not. 
 With this fund, ''we want to target companies in the earliest stages of development,'' Mr. Longo said. ''Companies with a product in the beta stage, who are getting ready to introduce it to the commercial market.'' 
 Joan McDonald, commissioner of the Department of Community and Economic Development, said Connecticut was uniquely positioned to invest in these types of clean technology jobs because of its highly educated and skilled workforce. She said companies also appreciated the proximity to other alternative energy and technology businesses, like United Technologies Power, which develops fuel cells. 
 Mr. Longo said the type of businesses that might qualify for the Clean Tech funding included a broad range of companies. ''Everything from renewable energy, environmental cleanup and remediation to battery storage companies'' would potentially be eligible for the funding, he said. 
 According to the Clean Tech Web site, clean technology includes wind power, solar power, biomass, hydropower, biofuels, information technology, green transportation, electric motors, lighting and energy-efficiency technologies. It also encompasses a range of products, services and processes that harness renewable materials and energy sources, reduce or optimize the use of natural resources, and cut or eliminate emissions and wastes.
 Mr. Longo said there was no deadline to apply for the funding. He said it would be doled out to qualifying companies until it was gone. A company may receive investments of up to $1 million through the fund. 
 In a news release, Mrs. Rell said: ''We want to position Connecticut as the preferred location to grow clean-tech jobs. The fund will help Connecticut entrepreneurs to develop cutting-edge solutions to address climate change and other global challenges. Their innovations in renewable energy, energy efficiency, environmental remediation and other vital clean-tech areas will create jobs in clean energy and related areas.''
 Mr. Longo said, ''We want to drive the growth of clean-tech jobs in the state.'' 
 The Clean Tech Fund was formed through a partnership between Connecticut Innovations, the Department of Economic and Community Development, and the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund. Connecticut Innovations and the Department of Economic and Community Development each has made an initial commitment of $3 million to launch the fund. The Connecticut Clean Energy Fund has pledged an additional $3 million for investments in companies that meet its criteria.
 In addition to managing the Clean Tech Fund, Connecticut Innovations is conducting a study of the clean technology jobs that already exist in the state. 
 Emily Smith, managing director of external relations for Connecticut Innovations, said the study, which will be submitted to the legislature in January, should help provide a clearer picture of what is happening in the Connecticut clean-technology sector, including the fuel cell industry. 
 ''We're looking to quantify the information and find out what drove that job growth,'' Ms. Smith said.

SECTION: Section AU; Column 0; Automobiles; LOS ANGELES AUTO SHOW; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 850 words

HEADLINE: Brave Faces, Hard Times

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
 ACROSS the United States, the inventory of unsold new vehicles accumulating at dealerships and on storage lots topped three million earlier this month. More cars and trucks arrive each week by the thousands in container ships, glutting the docks at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, just 23 miles from the convention center here.
 That bloated inventory -- a record, said Mary Raetz, assistant managing editor for data services at Automotive News, an industry weekly -- was no doubt on the minds of auto executives last week at previews of the Los Angeles auto show. Yet there were even more introductions of even more models here at the unofficial kickoff of the 2009 auto show season. 
 And while grim sales prospects drained some of the usual optimism, there seemed to be little alarm over the simultaneous hearings in Washington over whether the government should provide aid to American automakers.
 Speaking to journalists on Wednesday at the start of the media preview, Carlos Ghosn, chief executive of Nissan and Renault, offered little hope that stockpiled vehicles would be sailing out of showrooms soon. 
 ''October was the worst month for U.S. auto sales in 25 years,'' Mr. Ghosn reminded his audience. ''Nothing is moving. The decline is not confined to the U.S. market; most of the mature auto markets -- Europe, Japan -- are also down significantly, with slowdowns in the emerging markets as well.''
 So why are automakers -- including the Detroit companies who are telling Congress their survival is threatened without a federal bailout -- continuing to push even more new products?
 ''We are reinventing mobility,'' Mr. Ghosn said. ''There is no substitute for the automobile, and as soon as the economy stabilizes and people regain purchasing power, the first thing they will want to do is buy a car.''
 Nissan's plan, it seems, is to be ready when the money starts flowing again. The company unveiled two enticing models here, and they were not priced for a souring economy. More significant, the tuned-up 370Z sports car and sexy Infiniti G37 convertible both burn gasoline -- plenty of it, when their high-horsepower engines are provoked -- and not the alternative power sources that Mr. Ghosn praised in his address.
 Mr. Ghosn predicted that by 2020 worldwide electric vehicle sales would grow to seven million a year (from some 50,000 today), or about 10 percent of what he expects total annual vehicle production to be a dozen years from now. But at the Los Angeles show, which opened to the public Friday and continues through Nov. 30, there were few hints of what cars might be available then. 
 Honda offered the FC Sport, a fuel-cell-powered performance car that stirred much head-scratching over its styling. And there was just one new battery-electric model among the hundreds on display. That car, the Mini E, was not for sale.
 It is a modified Mini Cooper whose gasoline powertrain was replaced by lithium-ion batteries and a 150-kilowatt electric motor. BMW plans to lease 500 Mini E's for $850 a month in a one-year field trial in Los Angeles and New York City. 
 Other highlights were a mixed bag of debuts:
 HOT RODS AND HYBRIDS Ford introduced a modestly retouched Mustang here, updating the pony-car icon as it finally faces competition, from the Dodge Challenger and soon-to-arrive Chevrolet Camaro. The styling of the Ford Fusion midsize sedan has also been freshened, along with the similar Mercury Milan; the Lincoln MKZ was also tweaked. 
 Most notable in this group were the gasoline-electric hybrid versions of the Fusion and Milan, each of which can run up to seven miles on electric power alone, at speeds as fast as 47 miles an hour. Their fuel economy tops out at about 39 m.p.g. in town, which Ford pointed out was about 6 m.p.g. better than the Toyota Camry Hybrid. 
 GREEN POWER Gasoline and hybrid versions of the restyled Lexus RX -- the brand's best-selling model -- will be more powerful for the 2010 model year. A convertible version of the IS, introduced at the Paris Motor Show, was also on display.
 NO PICTURES, PLEASE The Mazda 3 is one of the best-handling small cars, and after a restyling it is one of the best-looking, too. But only if you see it in person: for some reason, this is not a photogenic vehicle. (In photos, it looks like an econobox at best, and like a smiling emoticon at worst.)
 THE ODOR-EATER BMW introduced its new clean-diesel 335d sedan by proclaiming, ''Let's face it, you stunk.'' That problem, BMW declared, is now solved with its advanced BluePerformance diesel engines, which are also quiet, don't smoke and drink only in moderation.
 CANCELLATION PENALTY In Los Angeles, General Motors went dark, like a Broadway theater on Monday night. G.M. had planned to reveal a new Buick LaCrosse sedan and a Cadillac CTS coupe. But citing cost issues, G.M. rescheduled the introductions to the Detroit auto show in January. 
 YOU CAN'T TOP THISChrysler, which had embarrassingly canceled its only two hybrid vehicles in October -- the same month they were introduced -- had nothing left to introduce here.
