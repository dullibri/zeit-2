HEADLINE: Text of the Fed's Statement on Cutting Interest Rates

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to lower interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to lower its target for the federal funds rate 25 basis points, to 4.5 percent.
 Economic growth was solid in the third quarter, and strains in financial markets have eased somewhat on balance. However, the pace of economic expansion will likely slow in the near term, partly reflecting the intensification of the housing correction. Today's action, combined with the policy action taken in September, should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets and promote moderate growth over time.
 Readings on core inflation have improved modestly this year, but recent increases in energy and commodity prices, among other factors, may put renewed upward pressure on inflation. In this context, the committee judges that some inflation risks remain, and it will continue to monitor inflation developments carefully.
 The committee judges that, after this action, the upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth. The committee will continue to assess the effects of financial and other developments on economic prospects and will act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.
 Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were: Ben S. Bernanke, chairman; Timothy F. Geithner, vice chairman; Charles L. Evans; Donald L. Kohn; Randall S. Kroszner; Frederic S. Mishkin; William Poole; Eric S. Rosengren; and Kevin M. Warsh. Voting against was Thomas M. Hoenig, who preferred no change in the federal funds rate at this meeting.
 In a related action, the Board of Governors unanimously approved a 25 basis-point decrease in the discount rate, to 5 percent. In taking this action, the board approved the requests submitted by the boards of directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of New York, Richmond, Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis and San Francisco.

HEADLINE: Is This It For the It Bag?

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
EVERYONE'S talking about the bubble, and when it will burst. 
 There is too much inventory. Prices are absurdly high. And analysts are predicting a slowdown in a market that may have already passed its peak of irrational growth, in 2004. Even as prices have increased exponentially over the last three years, with buyers trying to get in on the ground floor of premier properties -- the Paddington, the Muse, the Giant City -- so, too, have reports of dwindling consumer confidence and a looming credit crisis that could potentially wipe out the value of Uptowns and Downtowns alike.
 Some people are concerned that a combination of volatile interest rates and the weakened dollar will ultimately cripple the market.
 Status handbags, you see, are a lot like housing. After the rise of the $1,000 purse, fashion's equivalent of the $1 million studio, there inevitably comes talk of a backlash. Are we now living in a handbag bubble? 
 ''The new condo market today is comparable to the It bag,'' said Stephanie Phair, the vice president for merchandising for Portero, an online auction house that specializes in the resale of luxury goods. ''Every bag has a name. At least in New York, you see the same thing with all those condo buildings going up with valets, pools, dog parks and fancy names. At some point, people are going to decide that, in fact, what they'd like is to go back to the tried and tested, the classic prewar or the apartment on lower Fifth Avenue.'' 
 ''The appeal of the It bag,'' Mr. Phair said, ''has started to wane.''
 Yet this is a moment when every bag seems to have, in addition to a price tag that could be confused with a ZIP code, a name that conjures up images of a wealthy enclave or a cast member of ''Gossip Girl.'' Heloise, Mathilde and Beata are bags by Chloe; Mariah, Camila and Elsa come from Marc Jacobs; the Uptown, the Downtown and the Muse are designs from Yves Saint Laurent, not buildings by Andre Balazs. 
 An entire genre of slouchy handbags, described as ''hobos,'' may even strike some readers as unintentionally funny, if not slightly offensive, with their earnest descriptions and indiscreet prices -- the Dolce & Gabbana Miss Perfect hobo, $795; the Celine Bittersweet hobo, $1,700; the Prada nappa gauffre Antic hobo, $1,750 (a crazy gopher hobo?) -- for bags meant to look as if they once belonged to tramps.
 ''Designers are just testing the laws of economics by pricing handbags higher and higher until people stop buying them,'' said Lauren Goodman, the fashion director of Domino magazine. ''They are so expensive, and drive you to buy a new one every season, which is kind of a horrifying thought.''
 Ms. Goodman is aware of the hot bags of the moment: the Prada leather styles that repeat the ombre patterns of the fall collection; the Marc Jacobs oversize clutch, carried by several editors during the spring collections; the YSL Downtown bag, which is shaped like a Chinese takeout container with a handle. ''Some people still carry the Muse,'' she said of another YSL style. ''They think the Muse is hot, because they're kind of behind.''
 But how does one afford to stay ahead?
 At the rate that designers are introducing new styles, that no longer seems possible, which has led to a shift in perceptions about status bags.
 ''That whole phenomenon has changed,'' said Julie Gilhart, the fashion director of Barneys New York. ''Our customers seem to be looking for something more interesting. They don't want to spend money on something everyone else has.'' 
 They don't want a one-season bag.
 At the least, there is anecdotal evidence that the fastest-growing segment of the fashion industry, also considered its most lucrative because of its high profit margins, may not be immune to market exhaustion. 
 Coach, the leading American handbag company, reported last month that its profit growth may slow this holiday season, setting off jitters among investors who view the brand as the entry-level threshold for luxury goods and an indicator for the broader health of the market. One could not avoid the sense of dread reflected in a Women's Wear Daily headline this week: ''A Chilly Wind Blows: Retailers Are on Edge About Holiday Season.''
 Handbag sales in the $7 billion United States market are expected to increase by 15 percent this year, according to the stock research firm Telsey Advisory Group. This is considered a disappointment, because the growth is about half as strong as the category's 28 percent gain in 2004. 
 ''That $5,000 Marc Jacobs bag is so yesterday's news,'' said Elizabeth Kiester, the chief creative director of LeSportsac, which is developing a line of bags with Stella McCartney that will sell for under $350, beginning in February. ''The luxury market is so over the top now that it is demented. I call them limo bags. I don't have a limo.''
 It is probably a stretch to equate the slowing growth of handbag sales to It bag fatigue, but the statistics cited in Dana Thomas's book, ''Deluxe: How Luxury Lost Its Luster,'' indicate that the American population is currently over-accessorized. Ms. Thomas cites a survey that showed by 2004, the average American woman was buying more than four handbags a year.
 Ms. Phair, of Portero, said there is not a strong resale market for fashion bags of the moment. ''It's not that we wouldn't touch a Vuitton Murakami, but now it would be purchased by someone with a collector's perspective, who loves Louis Vuitton and wants to own pieces from every season,'' she said.
 In some circles, status bags have already become a punch line. A label called Slow and Steady Wins the Race recently produced a series of $100 handbags that recreated the shapes of iconic designs using inexpensive canvas -- ''a visual hyperbolic expression about contemporary fashion's attention and obsession with designer handbags,'' says its Web site. 
 The latest versions are hybrids: the Hermesbirkin-Dior (a saddlebag with Birkin-style handles), the Balenciaga-Chanel (where hardware meets quilting) and the Chanel-Asfour-Gucci (a circular quilted bag with a red-and-green stripe).
 One is tempted, then, to declare an end to the It bag, but, then again, there were a lot of bags at the spring collections that seem destined for stardom: the Richard Prince bags at Vuitton, the Duffy at Marc Jacobs, the cute wavy-striped bags at Prada. Ken Downing, the fashion director at Neiman Marcus, is amused that there is even a question of a handbag bubble.
 ''We certainly believe our customer is a fashion enthusiast, and our customers love handbags,'' he said. 
 At Neiman, the average bag sells for about $1,200, but Mr. Downing said there is no price resistance for a piece de resistance. A special edition of 25 Chanel bags, made in crocodile for the retailer's 100th anniversary last month, sold out in a snap. The price of each bag was $25,000.

HEADLINE: A Rate Cut, But a Sense It Stops Here

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve gave investors what they wanted on Wednesday, lowering short-term rates for the second time in two months. But it pointedly warned Wall Street not to assume that more reductions were ahead.
 The move, to reduce short-term rates by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 4.5 percent, was aimed at preventing the disruptions in mortgages from crippling the rest of the economy. But the vote was not unanimous, reflecting disagreement among policy makers.
 In a statement accompanying its decision, the central bank warned that ''some inflation risks remain'' and played down risks of a possible recession. ''The upside risks to inflation roughly balance the downside risks to growth,'' it continued. 
 That was more sanguine than the view of many investors and analysts on Wall Street, who have warning about the risk of recession and clamoring for easier money. But it also reflected the conflicting signals from the economy: despite a drastic plunge in the housing market, and oil prices approaching $100 a barrel, the overall economy has yet to show signs of serious trouble.
 Investors reacted with mixed feelings to the rate cut. Stock prices dipped briefly after the Fed announcement, but ended the day higher. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 13,930.01, up 1 percent. But prices of Treasury securities declined slightly, and the dollar dropped against other major currencies. 
 The dollar set a record low against the euro and a 50-year low against the Canadian dollar. Oil prices closed at a record high of $94.53 a barrel. 
 Just a few hours before the Fed announced its decision, the Commerce Department reported that the nation's gross domestic product expanded at a surprisingly rapid pace of 3.9 percent in the quarter that ended Sept. 30.
 In its statement, the central bank acknowledged that the economy would not keep up that pace, in part because of the depression in housing. But it predicted that the combination of its rate cut on Wednesday and its half-point cut on Sept. 18 ''should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy.''
 ''They were clearly firing an arrow across the bow of the financial markets,'' said Peter Kretzmer, senior economist at Bank of America. ''They were telling the markets not to presume that there will be further easing'' of interest rates.
 Indeed, Fed policy makers seemed to be pushing back against Wall Street, where investors and financial institutions had all but assumed the Fed would cut rates on Wednesday and many analysts argued that it should keep cutting after that.
 The dissenter in the 9-1 vote was Thomas M. Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Fed, who wanted to leave the overnight federal funds rate at 4.75 percent. 
 In another sign of disagreement, the presidents of 6 of the Fed's 12 regional banks did not ask for a reduction in the discount rate, the rate at which banks borrow from the Fed. The discount rate usually moves in tandem with the more central federal funds rate, which is the rate that banks charge one another for overnight loans. 
 ''What they're saying is, 'We'll do what is necessary to protect the economy, but right now we think it's unlikely we'll need to act,''' said Bruce C. Kasman, chief economist at JPMorgan Chase. ''They're setting the bar much higher now.''
 Analysts said the central bank's rate cut on Wednesday was akin to taking out an extra insurance policy against recession. Housing downturns have preceded 8 of the last 10 recessions, and this year's downward spiral is shaping up to be the deepest in history.
 The most recent data on home sales, housing prices and new construction have all been worse than analysts had expected. Defaults have climbed sharply on mortgages to subprime borrowers with weak credit histories, and analysts are predicting 500,000 to 2 million foreclosures on subprime loans by the end of next year.
 Wall Street firms and major banks have announced billions of dollars in losses on mortgage-backed securities in the last several weeks.
 Fed officials and private economists have predicted that the housing market has not hit bottom. Housing starts in September were down 31 percent from the year before. Sales of existing homes have dropped 30 percent since their peak in 2005, and the supply of unsold homes last month reached its highest level in more than 19 years.
 The nationwide average price of homes has declined almost 5 percent over the past year, the first time on record that has happened in the United States. On Tuesday, Standard & Poor's reported that its Case-Schiller index of housing prices in 20 major cities had declined 4.4 percent in August compared with one year earlier. 
 Several analysts said on Wednesday said the Fed was underestimating or at least underplaying the dangers posed by housing. 
 ''My core view is that they really don't get it,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, the United States economist for High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. ''This is not a housing correction. It is a massive, once-in-three-generations bursting of a housing bubble. It's a catastrophe, not a correction.''
 But several Fed officials have warned about reacting too strongly to what could be a false alarm. Janet L. Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed, noted in a speech last month that the Fed cut rates sharply after the Russian financial collapse in August 1998 when, as now, credit markets began to freeze up as investors worried about defaults. But the fear abated and the economic boom did not slow that year.
 Lyle E. Gramley, a former Fed governor who is a senior adviser to the Stamford Washington Research Group, said some policy makers were worried that rising wages and slower productivity growth could aggravate inflation.
 ''Unless productivity improves or the rise in compensation slows down, unit-labor costs will be rising too rapidly to keep core inflation down to 2 percent,'' Mr. Gramley said. ''That's what's got them worried.'' 
 Reactions to the Fed's move in currency markets and in oil prices highlighted one of the risks that faces the Federal Reserve: lower interest rates reduces the allure of American assets to foreign investors, which in turn weakens the dollar and tends to push up import prices.
 But Fed officials knew they were under very heavy pressure from financial markets. 
 Had the central bank decided to leave interest rates unchanged, the stock markets would most likely have plunged into a panic -- exactly what Fed officials wanted to avoid.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 3, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Thursday about the Federal Reserve's cut in short-term interest rates misspelled the name of Standard & Poor's housing price index. It is Case-Shiller, not Case-Schiller.

HEADLINE: An Unanswered Question: Who Follows Mubarak?

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN

DATELINE: CAIRO, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
An old joke here goes something like this: President Hosni Mubarak is on his deathbed when an aide comes to his side and says, ''Mr. President, aren't you going to give a farewell speech to the people?'' The president opens his eyes and replies: ''Really? Why? Where are the people going?''
 At three decades, Mr. Mubarak's tenure is the longest of any president since the ouster of the king in the 1950s. He has served longer than Gamal Abdel Nasser, a pioneer of Arab nationalism, and longer than Anwar el-Sadat, the man who made peace with Israel. He is routinely referred to as Egypt's modern pharaoh, though usually in a cautious whisper. 
 Beginning on Friday, Mr. Mubarak's ruling party, the National Democratic Party, will hold a general assembly. Six thousand, five hundred delegates from Egypt, along with guests from around the world, will gather to talk and listen. They will discuss economic, political and terrorism-related issues. What they will not discuss, party officials said, is succession -- arguably, and in many minds, one of the most important issues regarding Egypt's long-term stability.
 Who will come after Mr. Mubarak?
 It is a question many people here ask, but as a party official said after a briefing on the assembly, ''You will never get the answer you want.''
 ''The issue of succession is regulated by the Constitution,'' said Ali Eddin Helal, a party official at the briefing. ''This is a country ruled by institutions, not by individuals.''
 That is the answer you get.
 But the issue is so delicate that the government threatened to put an editor in prison after his newspaper ran articles saying the president was in ill health. The government's own prosecutors said the news had so shaken the nation, it had cost the economy hundreds of millions of dollars. As the rumors swirled about Mr. Mubarak's health, Egypt's chief religious official, appointed by the president, issued a fatwa saying that journalists who spread rumors should receive 80 lashes.
 The United States is watching the issue of succession closely because Washington risks finding itself in the same compromised position as Saudi Arabia found itself in Lebanon.
 The Saudis vested their influence in Lebanon in the former prime minister, Rafik Hariri. When he was assassinated, they lost their channel for influence and watched as the influence of Iran -- which invested in building an institution, Hezbollah -- grew. Saudi officials now say that Iran was smarter because even if someone were to kill the charismatic leader of Hezbollah, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, Iran's influence in Lebanon would continue through the institution. 
 Similarly, the United States has vested its interests in Mr. Mubarak, while directing most of its aid dollars to the Egyptian military. Mr. Mubarak has not always been the perfect ally, but American officials say that he is invaluable for his historical perspective and the importance he places on the relationship with the United States and peace with Israel. An American official here said the hope was that Mr. Mubarak's ultimate replacement would be someone who maintains the same historical appreciation for peace and relations with Washington.
 There are, of course, candidates who are talked about. Travel around Egypt and nearly everyone asked assumes the heir apparent is Gamal Mubarak, the president's younger son and a force in the ruling party. Hosni Mubarak once said that the presidency was not inherited in Egypt, and then derisively referred to the transfer of power in Syria, from Hafez al-Assad to his son Bashar.
 But many people say that the focus of Mr. Mubarak's statement was on the word inherited, not on his son, which means the younger Mr. Mubarak could become the elected president. Politics and elections in Egypt are controlled by the government and the ruling party, and in the absence of any true opposition, the party's candidate is certain to win.
 But there is a problem: every president since the king's overthrow has come from the military. Gamal is not a military officer, nor has he spent time in the ranks. Rumors have spread that the assembly will be used to elevate his position in the party as a first step in the transition. But party officials say that they expect no changes.
 The other name most commonly raised is Omar Suleiman, the longtime chief of intelligence. He holds the rank of general and is seen as more palatable to the military and as having the same orientation to Israel and Washington as Mr. Mubarak. But he presents a problem, too. He is not a member of the National Democratic Party and would have to resign from the military and spend a year as a high-ranking party official before he could become a presidential candidate. The only man who now possesses all the qualifications is the president himself.
 Publicly, party members say that it is too soon to discuss succession and that it is only the opposition that seeks to raise the issue to embarrass the president and his son. But many party members admit they are uneasy about how the military will respond when it is time to select a successor.
 Egypt's military is silent on political matters, leaving the face of governance to civilian bodies. But it is the most powerful institution in the country. The president, and only the president, knows the thinking of both arms of the state, military and civilian.
 Even if the party coalesced around a candidate, there is no way to know if the military would go along. With no obvious replacement, and no system to select one, it will be a game of wait and see, said one government official, who spoke anonymously for fear of retribution. ''I wonder if I will wake up one day and see tanks in the street,'' he said.
 Mr. Mubarak holds the title of president, but he is treated with reverence. About a year ago, one of his top public relations officials was asked if the president would be willing to give an interview for his obituary in The New York Times. It is standard to have obituaries prepared for historic figures. ''I am the last Egyptian you will talk to about that,'' the official said, both as a warning and as a bit of friendly advice.

HEADLINE: A Writer Who Always Sees History in the Present Tense

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
From Spain recently came news of a proposal by the government to erase all physical signs of the Franco dictatorship, as if by getting rid of the plaques and statues and street names from the old regime the country could rectify and obliterate a past it has preferred not to linger over. Meanwhile Polish voters just threw out a conservative government that wanted to drag up the past by holding job seekers accountable for their dealings under the Communists.
 Americans tend to be amnesiacs. Europeans, however, worry history, and no writer in Europe today has dealt more eloquently with the obligations and moral conundrums of memory, private and collective, than the Hungarian novelist and essayist Peter Nadas. Berlin, it happens, is where he came years ago to work on what turned into ''A Book of Memories,'' which, when the Hungarian censors finally consented in 1986 to let it be published, invited comparison to Proust and Thomas Mann, and caused Susan Sontag, after its translation into English 11 years later, to call it ''the greatest novel written in our time, and one of the great books of the century.'' 
 Berlin is also where Mr. Nadas lived for a while, after the wall fell, on a fellowship. Here again for a few weeks, passing through on the way from Hungary to New York to promote the publication of a collection of short stories and essays, ''Fire and Knowledge,'' he met the other day for a coffee at Manzini's, the cafe and sometime publishing hangout in west Berlin. In the morning, before the lunch crowd came, waiters in black vests and starched aprons laid white tablecloths and folded the day's newspapers behind the brass rails along the wooden booths. When Mr. Nadas arrived, in overcoat and hat, he smiled stiffly, took a seat at a table near the back and absently ordered a cappuccino. 
 Measured, courtly, with short gray hair and wire-rimmed glasses, in his physical manner remarkably still but with a playful laugh and a dry sense of humor, at 65 he fits the bill of the world-weary Eastern European intellectual. During the early 1970s the Hungarian secret service, which had collected incriminating details of his love affairs to use as blackmail, offered to approve a trip that he wished to take abroad -- he had proposed visiting places important to Mann like Rome and Munich -- in exchange for his informing on those he met with. 
 The security agents suggested that the ban on the publication of his works would end. He pretended not to know there even was a ban, and declined the deal.
 Now, he said about his forthcoming trip to New York, he found that to get a visa, he had to provide fingerprints and proof of his income for the last three months. ''If my publisher hadn't dealt with it, I wouldn't go,'' he remarked. ''You have to protect yourself from terrorism. But I tried to live my life under the Communists without subjecting myself to state violation. I didn't see the world until I was in my 30s because I wouldn't accept the rules of the regime for travel. I would rather have isolation than be told what I can do by the state.''
 Born in Budapest in 1942 (his first memory, from the age of 2, is of a fire in his house, when bombs were falling on the city), Mr. Nadas is the son of a working-class mother, who died of cancer when he was young, and a father, formerly a well-to-do bourgeois, who became a state prosecutor for the Communists and committed suicide not long after Soviet tanks quashed the Budapest uprising in 1956. The failure of that revolution, he said, taught most Hungarians to feel powerless and also abandoned by the West, fostering a suspicion of foreigners that in the post-Communist era and thanks now to the splintering of European opinion over American relations, has bred a dangerous nationalism, which is obviously spreading throughout the former Soviet countries and elsewhere.
 In an essay in the new book titled ''Parasitic Systems,'' Mr. Nadas recounts the Soviet-backed suppression of Czechoslovakia in 1968: ''While windshield wipers on Hungarian military vehicles ceased to work because of all the spit expectorated by Czechoslovaks lining the streets, and as the Hungarian soldiers riding in the vehicles trembled and wept, President Johnson in a confidential telegram reassured General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev'' that the United States would not interfere. Mr. Nadas, a young journalist back then, left his job and settled in a small village by the Danube to write fiction.
 ''For lack of something better to do, I resigned, walked out, and turned my back on the system to save my soul,'' he wrote. The era of so-called peaceful coexistence, during the cold war, compromised everyone's morals, and words -- issued by Hungarian authorities, or shared among friends who couldn't help suspecting one another of being informants, or coming from the West, which promised help but didn't give it -- no longer meant what they were supposed to. 
 Mr. Nadas recently reflected in a Hungarian newspaper, Elet es Irodalom, on the ambiguity of William Shirer's reporting from Germany while trying to skirt Nazi censors. Under such circumstances, ''an ambiguous sentence is a triumph,'' Mr. Nadas noted. ''The human spirit rejoices in single-handedly outsmarting the state police.'' 
 But then, can someone in, say, Boston, ''pouring sweet maple syrup over sizzling bacon'' understand ''from such ambiguous sentences how deformed the thoughts and actions of someone can become who for years has used their mother tongue for hiding thoughts rather than for expressing them?'' he asked. ''How meaning slips around in the shadow of words, hissing through the gaps in their definitions?'' 
 After '56 : ''Hungary tried a socialist-capitalism that was like squaring a circle,'' he recounted the other day. ''Common knowledge then was that if you didn't speak out you could go on with your little dealings. Gradually a second, then third economy developed -- a culture of corruption. When the wall fell, we had a peaceful change from socialism, but the negative side was that communist functionaries gained power again by privatizing what they ran before. They simply used the old networks of corruption, which are now blossoming.''
 Mr. Nadas began writing short stories when he was still a teenager, worked as a photojournalist before concluding he could no longer abide shooting happy proletarians to serve as government propaganda, and he wrote plays (Sontag once compared them to works by Pina Bausch and Thomas Bernhard) that, among other acts of political protest and independent expression, kept him in hot water with the authorities. 
 The struggle toward maturity as a novelist in works like ''A Book of Memories'' and in the three-volume ''Parallel Stories,'' a work of 18 years, published two years ago but not yet in English, was to turn what he has called the ''monkey tricks of my sentences'' into ''honest'' writing. That's a metaphor, clearly, for what he feels are also the obligations of a political citizen. 
 Personal responsibility, which means confronting the consequences of one's own compromised morality, is a recurrent theme in his writing about history and his literature. When asked about the proliferation of young Hungarian writers now, Mr. Nadas thought for a moment. ''It's the result of our nonisolation, which provides the freedom not to be politically engaged at all -- on the contrary -- they seem to have no interest in morality,'' he said.
 ''They deal with the minutest details of life: how you lift a glass, what you see on a journey. But they don't get involved in big ideas.''
 ''Recently I got into a fight with a military historian who thinks Hungary was the victim, Germany the perpetrator during the war,'' he said. Patrons now started to occupy lunch tables nearby, the gray morning giving way to a cold, sunny Berlin afternoon. ''It's a beautiful story we tell ourselves, but Germany is unique in the world for having dealt head-on with the past and not just about the war.
 ''This confrontation,'' he added, ''is exactly what Hungarians, French, Dutch and Americans, among many others, have not done.''
 Peter Nadas will appear Nov. 7 at the Hungarian Cultural Center, 447 Broadway, at Grand Street, SoHo, (212) 750-4450; and at the New York Public Library on Nov. 9, Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street, (212) 592-7730.

HEADLINE: Playing Sudan's Game

 BODY:
After four years of genocidal massacres that have killed more than 200,000 people, the Darfur region of Sudan desperately needs a peace agreement and a robust multinational force to carry it out. Regrettably, this week's internationally sponsored peace conference in Libya is doing little to meet those urgent needs. 
 The problem is not just Sudan's continuing duplicity -- it announced a cease-fire and then promptly violated it. Sudan does not really want a peace agreement. It merely wants more time to let the janjaweed militias it backs in Darfur finish killing or drive off what remains of the region's non-Arab population. 
 Many of the rebel groups that claim to be Darfur's defenders also bear serious responsibility. Some of the best-known rebel leaders failed to show up. And so, the killing is likely to proceed, with Sudan taking maximum advantage of the rebel's fecklessness, the diplomatic timidity of those closest to it and the failure of an Iraq-distracted Bush administration to pay consistent, high-level attention to the Darfur issue. 
 The Arab League, to which Sudan belongs, and China, a major customer for Sudan's oil, have at least started talking about Darfur. But they have yet to apply real pressure on Khartoum.
 The Arab League is reportedly readying proposals for Darfur's future economic development that all but overlook the far more pressing problem of creating the peace that is essential for development. China's tepid complaints seem aimed more at fending off Darfur-related protests at next year's Beijing Olympics than stopping the slaughter. President Bush's words on Darfur have been admirably strong, but he has not followed up with the high-level diplomacy and focus needed to rally effective international pressure on Sudan. 
 These failures, large and small, go a long way toward explaining why the killing continues monthly despite worldwide protests, White House speeches, American sanctions, African peacekeepers and Security Council resolutions. They make it easier for Sudan to take credit for announcing cease-fires that it has no intention of honoring, agreeing to peacekeepers that it has no intention of cooperating with and attending peace conferences that have no realistic possibility of bringing peace.
 Meanwhile, the genocide goes on.

HEADLINE: Japan: Central Bank Cuts Forecast

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Bank of Japan cut its annual economic growth forecast by 0.3 percentage points and held interest rates steady as uncertainty in the global economy continued to cloud Japan's outlook. ''The environment overseas has changed, and uncertainty over the global economy persists,'' Gov. Toshihiko Fukui, left, said at a news conference. The central bank lowered its growth forecast for the fiscal year through March to 1.8 percent, from 2.1 percent in April, noting ''uncertainties regarding overseas economies and global financial markets'' stemming from the subprime loan crisis in the United States.

HEADLINE: Plan to Use Cellphones as a Reward for Good Schoolwork Begins to Emerge

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM and JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
In New York City public schools, cellphones are considered contraband. But free cellphone airtime could be a reward for high-performing students if the city adopts the newest idea from the Education Department's chief equality officer.
 That official, Roland G. Fryer, a Harvard economist who is leading the city's program to pay cash to some students who do well on standardized tests, told an undergraduate economics class at Harvard last month that his next proposal would include a plan to give cellphones to students, and reward free minutes to those who do well -- an idea that is at odds with one of the city's most contentious school policies, the ban on students having cellphones in school. 
 The ban has been attacked by parents and politicians, who call it a draconian policy that endangers students. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who would have to approve Dr. Fryer's proposal, has repeatedly refused to budge on the ban despite the outcries. 
 After the City Council overrode the mayor's veto of legislation to allow children to carry their phones to school, City Hall officials emphatically pointed out that nothing would change and that cellphones would still be banned inside schools.
 Dr. Fryer's comments were described by several people who were present at the Harvard lecture on Oct. 10, part of his course titled ''Race in America.'' They did not want to be identified because, they said, Dr. Fryer had chastised his class for communicating with reporters about the lecture. 
 Most of Dr. Fryer's work has been closely guarded by the Education Department, where officials have repeatedly said that it is still in the ''developing stages.'' 
 Dr. Fryer did not return telephone calls and e-mail messages seeking comment.
 ''This is one of several student-motivation proposals that the department is considering,'' said David Cantor, a spokesman for the city Education Department. He said that ''this is a proposal that neither the mayor nor the chancellor has signed off on.'' 
 The proposal is in line with the larger incentive program that Dr. Fryer is running, as well as with programs offering bonuses to teachers and principals based on student performance.
 Last month, the city embraced a plan by a private foundation to reward students who pass Advanced Placement tests with thousands of dollars. 
 Under the newest proposal, the cellphones would be donated at virtually no cost to the city and students would be unable to make calls during school hours, Dr. Fryer said, according to people who attended the lecture. The free phones would have a fixed number of minutes of air time. Students who excel would be rewarded with additional minutes, Dr. Fryer told the class, the people said.
 If officials approve, the first batch of free phones, flip-style models donated by Motorola, would be delivered to several hundred students this month, Dr. Fryer told the class. He said that the program, if approved, would eventually attempt to include one million students in city schools. 
 Dr. Fryer also told the class that celebrities, including the hip-hop artist Jay-Z, might be asked to record ring tones.
 Chuck Kaiser, a spokesman for Motorola, said in an e-mail message that the company is ''aware of the concept,'' but that it would be premature to comment on it because ''the project is under consideration and no commitments have yet been made.'' 
 In June, when Dr. Fryer was first brought in as a close adviser to the schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, he said he would be looking at ways to ''rebrand academic success,'' and would consider a marketing campaign aimed at children in the public schools, particularly black, Latino and low-income students. But Dr. Fryer has been tight-lipped publicly about the details. 
 During a speech at the Schomburg Center in Harlem on Tuesday -- his first public appearance in New York this year -- Dr. Fryer alluded to some frustrations with dealing with the education politics of the city, saying that he was often asked by top officials, ''What is the union going to think of this?'' 
 To that, Dr. Fryer said, he responds, ''This is a personal mission between me and the 10-year-olds in Harlem.'' 
 While Dr. Fryer's incentive program has been criticized by some educators who say that it undercuts the idea that learning should be for its own sake, he faced a largely receptive audience on Tuesday and has been welcomed by several leading black leaders in the city. 
 ''We need to support Dr. Fryer in his efforts because, without any reservation, he is going to do in the 21st century for education what W. E .B. DuBois did in the 20th century,'' said the Rev. C. Vernon Mason, who runs a youth development program and spoke at Tuesday's event. 
 When one principal asked Dr. Fryer what he planned to do to change a culture in which students' success is mocked, he responded that he understood the urgency of the problem. 
 ''We are talking about a movement where we get kids to succeed. We're not talking about a slogan campaign,'' he said. Then he added, ''All I can say is stay tuned.''

HEADLINE: Energy Expert Sees Hazard in Costly Oil

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

DATELINE: LONDON, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
The rapidly growing appetite for fossil fuels in China and India is likely to help keep oil prices high for the foreseeable future, threatening a global economic slowdown, a top energy expert said on Wednesday.
 The unusually stark warning by Fatih Birol, chief economist of the International Energy Agency, about the effect of Asia's emerging giants comes as the agency prepares to issue its influential annual report next week, which will focus on China and India.
 In preparing the report, Mr. Birol said he had experienced ''an earthquake'' in his thinking. 
 ''China plus India are going to dominate growth in the oil markets,'' Mr. Birol said during an interview at an oil industry conference. Over the last 18 months, he noted, more than two-thirds of the growth in global oil demand came from China and India alone.
 Demand for oil in China, he added, would eventually equal the entire supply from Saudi Arabia. Partly as a result, the annual report will predict that oil prices could hit levels much higher than once thought possible, heightening the risk of a serious global economic slowdown.
 ''We may see very high prices that will come to a level where the wheels may fall off,'' Mr. Birol said. ''I definitely believe that if prices stay at these levels, there will be a slowdown of the global economy.''
 Mr. Birol said that China and India could help reduce demand and the environmental effect of their booming energy consumption by introducing greater efficiencies, building up renewable sources of energy, using more nuclear power and by cutting emissions.
 ''We think that climate change should be one of the topics that they reconsider as both China and India are becoming major players in the global international scene,'' Mr. Birol said. ''In accordance with that, they should also receive some responsibility.''
 China and India have long resisted calls to cut emissions, saying they need to grow to match standards of living in developed countries.
 They argue that other large emitters of greenhouse gases, like the United States, should lead the way in cutting emissions before poorer and less developed nations bear the same costs.
 The debate, which has undermined the Kyoto Protocol, a global treaty on greenhouse gas reductions, is set to resume when nations meet in December in Bali, Indonesia, where the two-year process of negotiating a successor treaty to Kyoto formally begins.
 At the oil conference, organized in part by The International Herald Tribune, major industry players struck a firmly upbeat tone about oil production -- particularly if prices stay high.
 ''At $93 a barrel, everything is possible,'' said Jose Sergio Gabrielli de Azevedo, chief executive of the Brazilian oil company Petrobras. He suggested that oil producers would continue to have incentives even to pursue the most expensive technologies, like producing oil from shale at $70 a barrel.
 But other officials at the event, including Guy F. Caruso, an administrator at the Energy Department, emphasized the need for continuing investment to recover oil from well-established oil-producing sources and countries, where he said the most important supplies would continue to originate.
 Demand for energy from China and India is coming at a time when structural changes are under way in global oil markets, reinforcing the view among experts that there will be a period of increasingly tight supplies ahead. Fields in many parts of the world, including the North Sea, the United States and Russia, have hit a plateau or are in decline.
 Should governments fail to limit growth in oil demand or to find alternative energy sources, especially in China, India and developed nations, ''we may see price levels much higher than we conventionally believed in the past,'' Mr. Birol said.

HEADLINE: The Feminine Critique

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN. 
E-mail: Belkin@nytimes.com

 BODY:
DON'T get angry. But do take charge. Be nice. But not too nice. Speak up. But don't seem like you talk too much. Never, ever dress sexy. Make sure to inspire your colleagues -- unless you work in Norway, in which case, focus on delegating instead. 
 Writing about life and work means receiving a steady stream of research on how women in the workplace are viewed differently from men. These are academic and professional studies, not whimsical online polls, and each time I read one I feel deflated. What are women supposed to do with this information? Transform overnight? And if so, into what? How are we supposed to be assertive, but not, at the same time? 
 ''It's enough to make you dizzy,'' said Ilene H. Lang, the president of Catalyst, an organization that studies women in the workplace. ''Women are dizzy, men are dizzy, and we still don't have a simple straightforward answer as to why there just aren't enough women in positions of leadership.'' 
 Catalyst's research is often an exploration of why, 30 years after women entered the work force in large numbers, the default mental image of a leader is still male. Most recent is the report titled ''Damned if You Do, Doomed if You Don't,'' which surveyed 1,231 senior executives from the United States and Europe. It found that women who act in ways that are consistent with gender stereotypes -- defined as focusing ''on work relationships'' and expressing ''concern for other people's perspectives'' -- are considered less competent. But if they act in ways that are seen as more ''male'' -- like ''act assertively, focus on work task, display ambition'' -- they are seen as ''too tough'' and ''unfeminine.'' 
 Women can't win. 
 In 2006, Catalyst looked at stereotypes across cultures (surveying 935 alumni of the International Institute for Management Development in Switzerland) and found that while the view of an ideal leader varied from place to place -- in some regions the ideal leader was a team builder, in others the most valued skill was problem-solving. But whatever was most valued, women were seen as lacking it. 
 Respondents in the United States and England, for instance, listed ''inspiring others'' as a most important leadership quality, and then rated women as less adept at this than men. In Nordic countries, women were seen as perfectly inspirational, but it was ''delegating'' that was of higher value there, and women were not seen as good delegators. 
 Other researchers have reached similar conclusions. Joan Williams runs the Center for WorkLife Law, part of the University of California Hastings College of the Law in San Francisco. She wrote the book ''Unbending Gender'' and she, too, has found that women are held to a different standard at work. 
 They are expected to be nurturing, but seen as ineffective if they are too feminine, she said in a speech last week at Cornell. They are expected to be strong, but tend to be labeled as strident or abrasive when acting as leaders. ''Women have to choose between being liked but not respected, or respected but not liked,'' she said.
 While some researchers, like those at Catalyst and WorkLife Law, tend to paint the sweeping global picture -- women don't advance as much as men because they don't act like men -- other researchers narrow their focus. 
 Victoria Brescoll, a researcher at Yale, made headlines this August with her findings that while men gain stature and clout by expressing anger, women who express it are seen as being out of control, and lose stature. Study participants were shown videos of a job interview, after which they were asked to rate the applicant and choose their salary. The videos were identical but for two variables -- in some the applicants were male and others female, and the applicant expressed either anger or sadness about having lost an account after a colleague arrived late to an important meeting. 
 The participants were most impressed with the angry man, followed by the sad woman, then the sad man, and finally, at the bottom of the list, the angry woman. The average salary assigned to the angry man was nearly $38,000 while the angry woman received an average of only $23,000. 
 When the scenario was tweaked and the applicant went on to expand upon his or her anger -- explaining that the co-worker had lied and said he had directions to the meeting -- participants were somewhat forgiving, giving women who explained their anger more money than those who had no excuse (but still less money than comparative men). 
 Also this summer, Linda C. Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University, looked at gender and salary in a novel way. She recruited volunteers to play Boggle and told them beforehand that they would receive $2 to $10 for their time. When it came time for payment, each participant was given $3 and asked if that was enough. 
 Men asked for more money at eight times the rate of women. In a second round of testing, where participants were told directly that the sum was negotiable, 50 percent of women asked for more money, but that still did not compare with 83 percent of men. It would follow, Professor Babcock concluded, that women are equally poor at negotiating their salaries and raises. 
 There are practical nuggets of advice in all this data. Don't be shy about negotiating. If you blow your stack, explain (or try). ''Some of what we are learning is directly helpful, and tells women that they are acting in ways they might not even be aware of, and that is harming them and they can change,'' said Peter Glick, a psychology professor at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wis. 
 He is the author of one such study, in which he showed respondents a video of a woman wearing a sexy low-cut blouse with a tight skirt or a skirt and blouse that were conservatively cut. The woman recited the same lines in both, and the viewer was either told she was a secretary or an executive. Being more provocatively dressed had no effect on the perceived competence of the secretary, but it lowered the perceived competence of the executive dramatically. (Sexy men don't have that disconnect, Professor Glick said. While they might lose respect for wearing tight pants and unbuttoned shirts to the office, the attributes considered most sexy in men -- power, status, salary -- are in keeping with an executive image at work.) 
 But Professor Glick also concedes that much of this data -- like his 2000 study showing that women were penalized more than men when not perceived as being nice or having social skills -- gives women absolutely no way to ''fight back.'' ''Most of what we learn shows that the problem is with the perception, not with the woman,'' he said, ''and that it is not the problem of an individual, it's a problem of a corporation.'' 
 Ms. Lang, at Catalyst, agreed. This accumulation of data will be of value only when companies act on it, she said, noting that some are already making changes. At Goldman Sachs, she said, the policy on performance reviews now tries to eliminate bias. A red flag is expected to go up if a woman is described as ''having sharp elbows or being brusque,'' she said. ''The statement should not just stand,'' she said. ''Examples should be asked for, the context should be considered, would the same actions be cause for comment if it was a man?'' 
 In fact, Catalyst's next large project is to advise companies on ways they can combat stereotypical bias. And Professor Glick has some upcoming projects, too.One looks at whether women do better in sales if they show more cleavage. A second will look at the flip side of gender stereotypes at work: hostility toward men.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Wants to Carry Its Christmas Ads Beyond Price

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT and MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
THE possibility that consumers will hesitate to spend for the holidays is worrying retailers as the Christmas shopping season gets under way. Wal-Mart, the nation's No. 1 merchant, is starting its big holiday advertising campaign today with an upbeat appeal that seeks to elevate saving money from a necessity to a virtue.
 The goal of the campaign, by the Martin Agency in Richmond, Va., part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, is to promote low prices as a means rather than an end -- less Scrooge and more Tiny Tim.
 For instance, in one commercial, the question, ''What will you do with your savings?'' is answered by showing a grinning boy riding a bicycle with a big red gift bow atop the handlebars. 
 A print advertisement presents a house and yard ablaze with Christmas lights. ''With great holiday decorations at unbeatable prices,'' the headline says, ''we've got two words for you: backup generator.'' 
 In another commercial, a wife raves about the ''incredible'' price she paid for a Toshiba HD-DVD player she bought her husband. ''All I know is that Christmas is going to be a very, very good day,'' she says, smiling.
 Another print ad, decorated with a ribbon-bedecked ornament labeled ''For every wish,'' shows gold jewelry; the prices are displayed near each earring, bracelet and necklace. ''We make it affordable to have a heart of gold,'' the headline declares.
 The goal is to persuade budget-minded consumers that ''the more you save, the more Christmas you can give,'' said Stephen Quinn, chief marketing officer at Wal-Mart Stores in Bentonville, Ark.
 ''The core statement of our holiday program is that you can save money if you shop at Wal-Mart,'' he added, but to ''find more positive and more emotionally connective ways'' to express it beyond prosaic appeals to buy stuff cheap.
 This is the first holiday campaign for Martin, an agency best known for its humorous Geico insurance campaigns, featuring offbeat characters like geckos and cavemen. The work for Wal-Mart is more mainstream in its approach, reflecting the retailer's heartland roots.
 Martin took over in January as the creative agency for Wal-Mart's general advertising account, with spending each year estimated at close to $600 million. There are also holiday ads aimed at Hispanic consumers, created by Lopez Negrete Communications; black consumers, from GlobalHue; and Asian-Americans, from the IW Group, another Interpublic agency. 
 The results of the campaign will be closely watched, because how Wal-Mart fares at Christmas could foretell the health of the American retail economy as shoppers struggle with rising energy prices and falling home values.
 ''Tough times are actually a good time for Wal-Mart,'' Tom Schoewe, chief financial officer, said during a meeting with Wall Street analysts last week, because ''our customers care a lot about price and value.''
 In September, Martin introduced a theme for Wal-Mart that is intended to reclaim the retailer's reputation as middle America's favorite discounter while adding uplifting sentiment to the sales pitch.
 The result -- ''Save money. Live better'' -- appears in most of the holiday campaign, which will include television, magazines, newspaper circulars, ads on Web sites and signs in stores. It supplants the more bargain-focused slogans Wal-Mart has used in previous years, which included ''Always low prices.''
 The ''save money'' part of the theme ''is in the DNA of Wal-Mart; it's why it was created,'' said Steve Bassett, creative director at Martin.
 The ''live better'' part is intended to offer ''a great promise,'' he added, beyond ''we're having a big blowout sale.''
 That is particularly important for Christmas, Mr. Bassett said, when consumers want to be ''celebratory'' rather than to dutifully count pennies.
 ''One of the pillars of the work is, 'Let's express joy,''' he added. ''We want people to come away with, 'Wow, it's going to be a great Christmas this year, and Wal-Mart will be part of that for my family.'''
 Wal-Mart's holiday marketing tactics have varied widely from one year to the next. This is a reflection of its recent struggle to determine whether it ought to concentrate on its traditional blue-collar customers or woo more affluent shoppers.
 In 2003, Wal-Mart cut toy prices so deeply it set off a price war with Toys ''R'' Us and KB Toys, which sent KB Toys into bankruptcy. The next year, Wal-Mart went lighter on the cutbacks, hurting sales.
 In 2006, the theme of the holiday campaign was ''Be bright,'' as Wal-Mart sought to stimulate sales of more expensive merchandise like designer sheets. 
 But sales slumped, so price cuts, which Wal-Mart calls rollbacks, quickly returned, creating an uneven tone.
 ''We had been experimenting a lot,'' Mr. Quinn said. ''The experimentation process is over.''
 ''We've hit a groove on what our core positioning is,'' he said, but because ''people already know Wal-Mart is a place to save, we're trying to make sure there is an emotional connection and not just an empty promise of 'Save, save, save.'''
 For Christmas, the campaign will express the thought this way, Mr. Quinn said: ''It's great to save money, but the feeling you get giving the bike the kid wants is the payoff.''
 A commercial for Hispanic shoppers makes that point by showing how the low price on a doll lets a mother also buy clothes for the doll, he said, ''rather than saying, 'You'll save two dollars here, a buck fifty there.'''
 Whether shoppers speak Spanish, English or Esperanto, Wal-Mart needs a big Christmas. 
 Despite record sales and earnings, Wall Street is worried about the company. Sales at Wal-Mart stores open at least a year, a crucial yardstick in retailing, have risen but at a steadily falling rate -- from an average of 3.6 percent a month in 2005 to 2.1 percent in 2006 to 1.5 percent so far this year. 
 A plan by Wal-Mart to use big-name brands and rock-bottom prices to lure customers has worked in the electronics and grocery departments, but it has so far failed in the home and apparel sections of the stores.
 ''Clearly, we're on a longer-term path to 'fix' those businesses,'' Mr. Quinn said, adding that for the holiday season there will be an emphasis on ''a lot of basics: fleece, jackets, hats.''
 For those who like decorating their homes for the holidays, Wal-Mart will for the first time operate themed Christmas shops, Mr. Quinn said. In many stores, they will be in the lawn and garden departments.
 The special shops will also stock Christmas toys, video games and foods. 
 The shops are another example of how Wal-Mart is seeking to offer shoppers ''higher-touch'' experiences than before, Mr. Quinn said, and help them ''get into the Christmas spirit'' instead of coming to Wal-Mart to trudge the aisles for bargains.
 The focus on well-known brands in electronics will continue for the coming Christmas, Mr. Quinn said, listing names like Sony and Toshiba. In the commercial about the Toshiba DVD player, the wife says the price was so low that ''even for Wal-Mart, I was surprised.''
 In a study released this week by BDO Seidman, 73 percent of the chief marketing officers at retailers said discounting and promotions would be more common this holiday season than last year. And 54 percent said sales would be flat compared with the 2006 holiday season.
 To help jump-start the holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart announced yesterday that it would offer door-buster discounts three weeks before they traditionally appear. Five popular products, including a laptop for $350, will go on sale at 8 a.m. tomorrow rather than the day after Thanksgiving.
 Wal-Mart said there would be additional door-busters on Nov. 23.
 The holiday campaign will appear on TV networks like ABC, ABC Family, CBS, CMT, CW, Discovery, E!, ESPN, HGTV, Lifetime, NBC, Nick at Nite, TBS, TLC, TNT and USA. The publications to carry the print ads include Better Homes and Gardens, Family Circle, Parade, People and Redbook.

President Bush announced Wednesday that he had selected Edward T. Schafer, a former two-term Republican governor of North Dakota, to head the Department of Agriculture. 
 Mr. Schafer, 61, was picked to succeed Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns, who resigned recently to prepare to run in Nebraska for the Senate seat that will be vacated next year when Chuck Hagel retires. If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Schafer will oversee a department that has more than 100,000 employees and spends about $90 billion a year on a wide array of programs that include crop supports, forestry and nutrition.
 If the Senate acts quickly, as the president requested, the new secretary could be involved in negotiations over a new farm bill, calling for the spending of some $288 billion on crop subsidies, nutrition, conservation, rural development and other items over the next five years. The Bush administration is trying to cut back on some farm programs, which have considerable support on Capitol Hill. 
 ''I rely on the secretary to provide sound advice on issues ranging from our nation's farm economy and food supply to international trade and conservation programs,'' Mr. Bush said at the White House with Mr. Schafer standing next to him.
 Mr. Schafer, whose Danish immigrant grandparents were farmers, said he realized ''that the mission of this agency goes far beyond the services delivered, to the preservation of a way of life that I believe is the foundation of this country.'' 
 Mr. Schafer was elected governor in 1992 and re-elected in 1996. He chose not to run for a third term in 2000.

HEADLINE: Veto Likely For a Bill Favoring Workers

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
(Bloomberg News) -- The House of Representatives voted Wednesday for the largest expansion ever of a program to help workers hurt by imports or overseas competition, setting up a fight with President Bush, who has threatened to veto the measure. 
 The Democratic-controlled House voted 264 to 157 to expand the Trade Adjustment Assistance program to include service workers like X-ray technicians and call-center employees and to expand a tax break to help the unemployed pay for health insurance. The bill would also provide new tax breaks to encourage companies to relocate to communities where factories have closed.
 ''Free trade can only thrive if we help those hurt by the negative consequences of globalization,'' said Nancy Pelosi, speaker of the House. ''The status quo is not working.''
 The trade adjustment program, which began in 1962, expires at the end of the year unless it is renewed. It provides workers who have been harmed because their plant moved overseas or shut because of increased imports with an additional 18 months of unemployment insurance, subsidized training and a tax break to help pay for health insurance.
 While Republicans, business groups and the administration all say they support the program, they objected to Wednesday's measure, sponsored by Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York. They said it would unnecessarily expand aid to workers who are not directly harmed by trade and would pay for that additional $5.2 billion in benefits by delaying a tax break meant to help multinational companies.
 The bill ''builds a bigger bureaucracy that will make it harder for unemployed workers to access relevant training and reconnect with the job market,'' Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao said in a statement after the vote. The House vote fell short of the two-thirds majority necessary to override a veto.
 The House voted down a Republican amendment that would have brought about more modest changes to the current program and would not have delayed the corporate tax break. 
 In the final vote, 38 Republicans, including many from the hard-hit industrial states in the Great Lakes region, voted to expand the program.
 ''If America is serious about having a stronger trade policy, then we need to strengthen the safety net for working families,'' said Representative Phil English, Republican of Pennsylvania, who voted for the measure.
 At the last minute, the House added a provision that would require smaller companies to give notice before they lay off workers and extend the notification period to 90 days from 60.

HEADLINE: Iraq Asks for Iran's Help In Calming Kurdish Crisis

BYLINE: By ALISSA J. RUBIN; Thom Shanker contributed reporting from Washington.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Iraqi officials asked for Iran's help on Wednesday in negotiating a diplomatic solution to the standoff with Turkey over Kurdish guerrillas who have been using northern Iraq as a base to stage raids on Turkish troops across the border.
 Tensions between Iraq and Turkey over the issue threaten to overshadow other topics at a regional meeting that starts Thursday in Istanbul, which Iraq hoped would focus on its internal security. 
 The United States, which will participate in the meeting, said Wednesday that it has stepped up the amount of intelligence it shares with Turkey on the Kurdish rebels, known as the P.K.K.
 Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq met with the Iranian foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, on Wednesday and asked him to intervene on Iraq's behalf at the meeting. 
 ''The prime minister asked the Islamic Republic to present their full support to Iraq during the Istanbul meeting and also to participate in solving the border crisis between Turkey and the P.K.K.,'' a statement from Mr. Maliki's office said. 
 The P.K.K., or the Kurdistan Workers' Party, has killed at least 42 people in Turkey in the past month, mostly soldiers. The group, which has supporters among Turkey's Kurdish minority as well as in Iraq, has fought in the past for a separate Kurdish state in Turkey but now appears to be focused on winning rights for Kurds living there. 
 Turkey has threatened to invade Iraq in pursuit of the rebels but has so far refrained.
 Iran has been sympathetic to Turkey's position, because Kurdish guerrillas have also been attacking Iran, but it has loyalties to Iraq which, like Iran, has a Shiite-majority government. Iran has also worked closely with the Kurdish leadership in Iraq. 
 In comments at a news conference on Wednesday, the Iraqi foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, said that he had discussed the situation with Mr. Mottaki and that he had warned of ''serious consequences'' if Turkey were to invade Iraq.
 ''It will have consequences for the entire region,'' he said he told Mr. Mottaki.
 However, Mr. Zebari also said Iraq needed help from its neighbors on many other issues, such as border security, refugees and economic investment. ''The Istanbul meeting should not be hijacked by the P.K.K. terrorist activities in Turkey,'' he said. 
 The issue is a thorny one for most of the meeting's participants. The United States, which will be represented by Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, has close relations with Turkey and the Kurdish regional government in Iraq, and is eager not to antagonize either one. Turkey, Iran and Syria, all of which are sending representatives, have Kurdish minorities. 
 The secretary general of the United Nations, Ban Ki-moon, and a number of other foreign ministers are also expected to attend. 
 Iraqi diplomats said they were worried that after the Turkish prime minister, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, met with President Bush on Nov. 5, Turkey may take action against the Kurdish guerrillas, a step that could further antagonize Iraq's Kurds. 
 ''They are under a lot of pressure from the public, so we think they will do something,'' said a senior Iraqi official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter. ''We hope they will not.''
 Mr. Erdogan has asked the United States to help the Turks take ''concrete steps'' to reduce the P.K.K. threat. 
 In Washington, Geoff Morrell, the Pentagon spokesman, confirmed that the United States military was giving ''lots of intelligence'' to Turkey in its effort to halt the rebel attacks.
 Pentagon officials have said that they have sent spy planes over the region to gather information on the P.K.K., and Mr. Morrell said the United States had given Turkey ''an increased level of intelligence'' as a result of Turkey's ''recent concerns.''
 He also said the military was ''making efforts to help them get actionable intelligence,'' a term meaning timely and accurate information that can be used to attack a specific target. That is ''a pretty high standard,'' he said.
 Although the Kurdish regional government is part of Iraq, the central government has little control over its policies. The Kurdish area functions as a semiautonomous state with its own military force that is only nominally under the control of Iraq's Defense Ministry. That means that for Iraq to oust the Kurdish guerrillas, it would need the Kurdish government's support. Traditionally, Kurds have been reluctant to take on fellow Kurds.
 During the news conference, Mr. Mottaki said the Iranians were prepared to meet again with the United States to discuss Iraq's security. But he signaled his country's displeasure over the American military's detention of Iranian officials in Iraq. 
 American troops detained five Iranian officials in Irbil in January; they have yet to be released. The Americans said the five had links to Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards. The Iranians said they were diplomats. 
 In August, American troops detained a delegation of six Iranian Energy Ministry officials, but they were released a day later. The Iraqi government has asked the United States to release the Iranians still being held.
 ''The arresting of Iranian consular officials is a very big strategic mistake,'' said Mr. Mottaki, who also objected to a comment by General David H. Petraeus that the Iranian ambassador in Baghdad was a member of the Quds Force, the elite Revolutionary Guard unit. 
 Also on Wednesday, six unidentified bodies were found in Baghdad.

HEADLINE: A New Lifestyle in South Korea: First Weekends, and Now Brunch

BYLINE: By SU HYUN LEE

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
When she returned to Seoul in 2000 after 10 years in New York City, Park Su-ji introduced her fellow South Koreans to an exotic way to socialize over food: brunch.
 ''I really missed brunch but didn't find any brunch restaurants,'' Ms. Park said. So in the spring of 2005 she opened Suji's, which serves toasted bagels and blueberry pancakes, among other brunch staples, in a setting that features black-and-white photographs of the Chrysler Building and Union Square in New York.
 Ms. Park said that she had thought her restaurant would primarily attract Western expatriates. But two years later, scores of restaurants in Seoul offer or even specialize in brunch -- and they are filled with South Koreans. Restaurant owners and local newspapers say there may be as many as 200 such restaurants. 
 The sudden embrace of the leisurely late-morning repast reflects greater exposure to Western customs and cuisines as more South Koreans travel, work and study abroad. But it also is related to a watershed development at home: the mandatory weekend.
 For decades South Korean governments have stressed hard work and making money, which has helped to turn the country's economy into one of the most robust in the world. But starting in 2004, the government began shortening the official workweek from six days to five. Now, all enterprises with 50 or more employees are required to provide two days off. By 2011, all companies must do so.
 The discovery of the weekend has meant an explosion in new activities. Inns have opened up all over the country to accommodate overnight excursions. The new opportunity for short trips to neighboring countries has helped catapult South Koreans to the top ranks of tourists in the region.
 The unaccustomed free time has also meant that South Koreans can start indulging themselves like the young New Yorkers they had been watching in syndicated television sitcoms like ''Sex and the City,'' whose characters always seemed to be whiling away enjoyable hours over brunch.
 Now, on weekends female friends, male buddies, couples, parents with toddlers and three-generation families all line up outside crowded brunch restaurants like Suji's, Butterfinger Pancakes, Tell Me About It, Flying Pan Blue, Stove and All Day Brunch. Some restaurants are so packed that reservations must be made days in advance. Once inside, if they can get inside, people spend two to three hours chatting away.
 ''Before the five-day workweek started, we were always tired after drinking until late, because nighttime was the only time to socialize,'' said Suh Yang-ho, a 29-year-old who was having brunch with a colleague one recent Saturday at Stove.
 ''I think it's healthier to relax like this over home-cooked-style food in the late mornings,'' said Mr. Suh, who works at Credit Suisse in Seoul.
 His colleague Choi Hey-rung, 30, gave another reason for preferring brunch. ''I don't want to cook,'' she said. ''So on Sundays, I bring my family, including my parents-in-law, to brunch a little after noon.''
 Traditionally, married Korean women have stayed home with their families; they did not go out with friends on weekends. Now, married as well as single women avoid cooking when they can and are leading the move toward eating out. They regularly get together with friends over brunch. Daughters are introducing their mothers to this laid-back way of passing a weekend morning. Wives are trying to get their husbands to appreciate the leisurely lifestyle it represents.
 On a recent Sunday, Han Kye-soon, 29, was catching up with three other single women at a corner table at Suji's.
 ''I feel like a New Yorker or a Parisian, like the characters of 'Sex and the City,''' said Ms. Han, a pottery designer.
 What makes the brunch fashion somewhat surprising is that Koreans tend to be reluctant to try non-Korean foods. Even when traveling abroad, they gravitate toward kimchi (fermented vegetables) and bibimpap (rice with vegetables and chili paste). Eating steak and potatoes with knives and forks can be considered an act of sophistication.
 Brunch is popular even though some Koreans do not really like the food served at the meal: eggs and bacon, pancakes and toast are all a marked contrast to the usual Korean breakfast of rice, soup and vegetables. The portions are huge by Korean standards. And brunch can be expensive, typically around 25,000 won, or $27.50.
 Will the brunch boom last? Clearly it has not taken with some people here.
 On a recent Sunday, Jegal Min-jung, 22, and her parents were sitting at a table in the middle of Suji's. Fashionably world-weary patrons occupied seats by the wide-open windows, while young couples perched on high bar stools.
 Ms. Jegal, who had heard about Suji's from a friend, had wanted to experience brunch with her parents.
 Her mother, Kang Deok-hee, had agreed: ''It sounded like it would be less greasy than other Western food, like steak with gravy.''
 Wishing to sample a variety of dishes from the English-language-only menu, the family ordered eggs sunny side up with toast and sausages; blueberry pancakes; and egg salad with fried potatoes and a toasted bagel. But the time it was taking for all that food to show up tested the father's patience.
 After steaming silently for some time, the father, Jegal Yoon, shouted to the waiter to serve the food more speedily.
 ''Bring each dish when it's ready,'' he said. ''I'm busy and need to leave as soon as possible.''
 His wife made a face, then smiled. She explained, ''My husband has to go to work after this.''

 BODY:
'THE USUAL FREAK SHOW' In the mid-1980s Jeffrey Essmann was writing and performing satirical character comedy, revuelike shows that were neither theater nor exactly cabaret. ''The whole East Village thing was kicking in,'' he said recently, describing a scene busy with performers trying new things in joints now long gone. ''It wasn't even worth remembering the names of the clubs because they only lasted a few weekends.'' 
 His sidekick, who composed and played the piano in shows like ''Jeffrey Essmann's Artificial Reality,'' was Michael John LaChiusa, who yet to write the musicals ''The Wild Party'' and ''See What I Wanna See.'' Despite good reviews into the early 1990s, Mr. Essmann, above, eventually became frustrated that his career was not taking off. ''As far as I was concerned I was still working in a video store,'' he said. So he left for Chicago. 
 But New York tends to call its artists home. Mr. Essmann is back, and he and Mr. LaChiusa are performing ''The Usual Freak Show,'' which opens tonight at La MaMa E.T.C. The material is mostly new, but the form is familiar: character monologues and bits of song, with Mr. Essmann taking on several roles, and Mr. LaChiusa playing the piano and donning the occasional wig or persona. (''My job is to make good faces,'' he said.) At least one character from the old days will return: Barbie, one of his most popular takeoffs. ''She's a hopeless alcoholic, Ken has left her, and it's the end of the road,'' Mr. Essmann said. ''It's Britney, it's Lindsay.''
 During a recent rehearsal in Mr. LaChiusa's apartment the two talked about why literary character comedy is largely a thing of the past. ''AIDS decimated everything,'' Mr. LaChiusa said, referring to the loss of talent on the downtown scene. ''I think that was one of the biggest things that happened. And that's not funny.'' 
 Mr. Essmann agreed. ''Years later I think we're seeing what a gap that is,'' he said. ''All those friends constituted a real wealth of talent that was just gone -- like that.'' (Through Nov. 18, Fridays and Saturdays at 10 p.m., Sundays at 5:30 p.m., the Club at La MaMa E.T.C., 74A East Fourth Street, East Village, 212-475-7710, lamama.org; $15.) STEVEN McELROY

 Broadway
 'A BRONX TALE'Chazz Palminteri stars in a revival of his one-man show from 1989 about growing up under the friendly tutelage of an Italian-American crime kingpin. Tamer than ''The Sopranos,'' certainly, but Mr. Palminteri's sweet, funny stroll down a memory lane peopled by scary men with silly nicknames is a pleasant diversion (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 
 'A CHORUS LINE' If you want to know why this show was such a big deal when it opened on Broadway 32 years ago, you need only experience the thrilling first five minutes of this revival. Otherwise this archivally exact production, directed by Bob Avian, feels like a vintage car that has been taken out of the garage, polished up and sent on the road once again (2:00). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 
 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'GREASE' A limp revival of a musical set in a high school that feels like a musical put on by a high school. Kathleen Marshall directs and choreographs a charisma-free ensemble, whose leads (Max Crumm and Laura Osnes) were cast via reality television (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'MARY POPPINS' This handsome, homily-packed, mechanically ingenious and rather tedious musical, adapted from the P. L. Travers stories and the 1964 Disney film, is ultimately less concerned with inexplicable magic than with practical psychology. Ashley Brown, who sings prettily as the family-mending nanny, looks like Joan Crawford trying to be nice and sounds like Dr. Phil. Directed by Richard Eyre and Matthew Bourne (2:30). New Amsterdam Theater, 214 West 42nd Street, (212) 307-4747. (Brantley)
 'MAURITIUS' Ersatz Mamet -- ''American Buffalo,'' to be exact. Theresa Rebeck's deftly formulaic drama about a power struggle over a rare stamp collection has the feeling of an expertly drawn blueprint on tracing paper. Doug Hughes directs a tasty cast that includes Alison Pill, Bobby Cannavale and F. Murray Abraham (2:00). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'LES MISERABLES' This premature revival, a slightly scaled-down version of the well-groomed behemoth that closed only three years ago, appears to be functioning in a state of mild sedation. Appealingly sung and freshly orchestrated, this fast-moving adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel isn't sloppy or blurry. But its pulse rate stays well below normal (2:55). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'PYGMALION' David Grindley's misfired revival of Shaw's classic comedy pairs a de-sexed, infantile Henry Higgins (Jefferson Mays) with a hard-working but affectless Eliza Doolittle (Claire Danes). Chemistry? ''Not bloody likely,'' as Eliza would say. With excellent supporting performances from Boyd Gaines and Helen Carey (2:25). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)
 'THE RITZ' This oddly inert revival of Terrence McNally's risque 1975 farce set in a gay bathhouse demonstrates that yesterday's dirt is often today's dust. But it does feature a delicious turn by Rosie Perez as a talentless chanteuse, and Kevin Chamberlin as the evening's much put-upon straight man. Joe Mantello directs (1:55). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'SPRING AWAKENING' (Tony Award, best musical 2007) Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'XANADU' An improbably entertaining spoof of the majestically awful movie from 1980 about a Greek muse (Olivia Newton-John, roller-skating into oblivion) who inspires a young artist in Venice Beach, Calif., to chase his disco dream. Kerry Butler mimics Ms. Newton-John's Aussie accent and sports her signature skates-and-leg-warmers look, but also puts her own affectionate stamp on a seriously silly role. The impish playwright Douglas Carter Beane, who wrote the adaptation, also supplies great material for the domineering comic actresses Jackie Hoffman and Mary Testa. Blissfully idiotic, practically sublime (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 Off Broadway
 'BLACK WATCH' Gregory Burke's transfixing play from the National Theater of Scotland, inspired by interviews with soldiers who served in Iraq, is a glorious reminder of the transporting power of the theater. John Tiffany directs this seamless, haunting mix of drama, song and dance (1:50). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779. (Brantley) 
 'DIE MOMMIE DIE!' A happy play about haute homicide in Beverly Hills, written by Charles Busch, who also portrays the irresistibly evil has-been heroine. Mr. Busch manages to summon an entire host of over-the-hill screen sirens from the twilight of Hollywood's golden age (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'A FEMININE ENDING' Sarah Treem's play is about an oboe player and aspiring composer trying to choose between pursuing a career and marriage to a pop star. An outmoded concept treated with minimal truthful detail. With Marsha Mason and Richard Masur as kooky parents (1:30). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)
 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: RUDE AWAKENING' The 25th-anniversary version of Gerard Alessandrini's invaluable index to current American musicals has priceless moments (especially its parody of the hot-and-bothered antics of ''Spring Awakening''). But it's also a sobering reminder that even an inspired satirist can be defeated by emaciated targets (1:30). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'FUERZABRUTA' A sensory bath aimed at clubgoing college kids in search of cultural diversion. Thumping techno music, smoke and a standing throng surround you as you watch a curious collection of semi-spectacular technical feats (1:05). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'GONE MISSING' A delightful revival of the Civilians' revue of songs and monologues about lost shoes, cellphones, jewelry and maybe an illusion or two. The sharp young company brings energy and wit to both the collagelike text, composed of odd tales of dispossession, and Michael Friedman's eclectic cavalcade of pastiche songs. Brisk, funny and clever (1:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 'GREETINGS FROM YORKVILLE' No theme is hardier in musical theater than that of the ingenue trying to break into the big time: In this slender but sweet musical, basically a glorified cabaret evening, the set-up has a veritable reality-show spin, since it is the true story of the people who wrote and are performing it. Anya Turner and Robert Grusecki, a struggling team of songwriters, portray their efforts to get ahead in the songs they wrote along the way, some of which are very good, and which are well sung, particularly by Ms. Turner, who has a deep, warm voice with a hint of whiskey in its color. The question is whether the happy ending that this piece cries out for is actually being provided by its current incarnation (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Anne Midgette) 
 'THE JOKE' Two comics working the Catskills in the 1960s and '70s gradually go in different directions, putting strains on their partnership, reminiscent of a doomed marriage, in this well-conceived two-hander by Sam Marks. Thomas Sadoski and Jordan Gelber play it with admirable verve (1:10). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-4500. (Neil Genzlinger) 
 'JUMP' Video game theater from Korea mixes martial arts and broad comedy with lowbrow results (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Jason Zinoman)
 'MASKED' A powerful play about three Palestinian brothers torn by the dilemma of accommodation or resistance to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Written by an Israeli, the play is a thoughtful and sobering drama that avoids political statements or moral judgments (1:25). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Wilborn Hampton) 
 'MILK-N-HONEY' This frequently entertaining primer on food politics is partly fiction and partly based on interviews with people like farmers, Dumpster divers and food chemists. The show has an appealing sense of mission, but it too earnestly wants to convince us that we are prisoners of American consumerism. On the plus side, you get candy (1:25). 3LD Art and Technology Center, 80 Greenwich Street, at Rector Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 388-7371. (Rachel Saltz) 
 'THE MISANTHROPE' The experimental Belgian-born director Ivo van Hove goes for the guts in this production, turning Moliere's courtly hypocrites into a wallowing, rutting, howling menagerie of beasts. Less a deconstruction than a detonation, but it does allow the excellent Bill Camp to find the tragic anguish in the title role (1:50). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'MY FIRST TIME' Ken Davenport's venture into Web-theater synergy mines a site called MyFirstTime.com to cull stories of inaugural encounters with sex. Four actors deliver the anecdotes in what amounts to little more than a crassly commercial effort to replicate the success of ''The Vagina Monologues'' (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante)
 'NONE OF THE ABOVE' An uneven revival of a slight comedy that wants to be taken seriously. There are some clever one-liners, but much of the humor is of the sitcom variety. A bigger problem in this staging is a lack of chemistry between the play's two characters (1:45). Lion Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Hampton) 
 'THE OVERWHELMING' J. T. Rogers's smart and honorable drama about blundering Americans in Rwanda presents a sprawling panorama of perspectives on a nation in turmoil. Fluidly directed by Max Stafford-Clark, the production never quite evokes lives that are real instead of representative (2:20). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'THE OXFORD ROOF CLIMBERS REBELLION' An excellent play about two famous soldier-scholars -- T. E. Lawrence and Robert Graves -- and their passionate disillusionment with the British establishment over World War I, particularly the government's attempts to ennoble the slaughter known as the Great War. Although set in Oxford University in 1920, the play is as timely as today's newspaper (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444. 
 (Hampton) 
 'THE RISE OF DOROTHY HALE' Myra Baistow has fashioned an intriguing but uneven look at the real-life case of Dorothy Hale, a minor actress with important friends (including Harry Hopkins, adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt), who fell to her death from the Hampshire House on Central Park South in 1938. The case has eerie parallels to the Marilyn Monroe story, but the starry cast, which includes Sarah Wynter and Sarita Choudhury, plays it all with a chilly detachment (1:45). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Genzlinger) 
 'THE SENSUOUS WOMAN'Margaret Cho headlines an oddball burlesque review that mixes stand-up comedy (mostly gay) and stripping (a little of everything). Raunchy but only intermittently fun (1:30). Zipper Factory, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 
 'SIVE' The Irish Rep throws itself away on this clunky 1959 melodrama about a schoolgirl married off to a rich old man (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (Caryn James) 
 'THREE MO' TENORS' Great opera it ain't, but there's kitschy fun and not too much that's cringe-inducing in this diverse musical vehicle for black tenors (2:00). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Claudia La Rocco) 
 'TINGS DEY HAPPEN' An engrossing one-man show about the Fulbright year its author and performer, Dan Hoyle, spent in Nigeria; in the spirit of theatrical journalism, it is at once a travelogue, a cultural survey and a good introductory course in oil politics. But it is the people the audience meets who raise the exercise above a guided tour (1:25). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Hampton) 
 'VENGEANCE' Ron Fitzgerald's ''Rats,'' featuring a terrific performance by Michael Mosley as an unemployed adman with an unexpected visitor, is the high point of this entertaining bill of five new short plays, presented by stageFarm. Gina Gionfriddo's ''Squalor'' takes a skewed look at the search for Internet pedophiles, and ''Specter,'' by Neena Beber, is a daffy take on a certain record producer named Phil. Five actors do it all, impressively (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 
 'WALMARTOPIA' This time-traveling musical satire is an uneasy mix of an earnest, power-to-the-workers message and blunt satire, positing an Orwellian future ruled by Wal-Mart. The music is a pastiche of styles, ranging from a Peter Allen conga line to gospel, but Cheryl Freeman's energetic performance as a put-upon Wal-Mart employee rises above it all (2:00). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (James)
 Off Off Broadway
 'A GLANCE AT NEW YORK' Axis Company's daffy resurrection of this lowbrow stage work from 1848 seems, at 50 minutes, to go by in a heartbeat, and when it's over, you'll have no sense of what made the play so popular way back when. But you'll have been entertained by the company's assaultive delivery. The story involves a rube who comes to New York and is fleeced repeatedly, and a fireman named Mose who punches people (1:00). Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 
 Long-Running Shows
 'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10). Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'CHICAGO' Irrefutable proof that crime pays (2:25). Ambassador Theater, 219 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)

 'THE DROWSY CHAPERONE' A pasteboard pastiche of 1920s musicals, as remembered by a witty show queen (1:40). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 
 'THE FANTASTICKS' The Little Musical That Wouldn't Die redux (2:05). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)

 'JERSEY BOYS' The biomusical that walks like a man (2:30). August Wilson Theater, 245 West 52nd Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'THE LION KING' Disney on safari, where the big bucks roam (2:45). Minskoff Theater, 200 West 45th Street at Broadway, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'MAMMA MIA!' The jukebox that devoured Broadway (2:20). Cadillac Winter Garden Theater, 1634 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' Who was that masked man, anyway? (2:30). Majestic Theater, 247 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'RENT' East Village angst and love songs to die for (2:45). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'SPAMALOT' A singing scrapbook for Monty Python fans (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' ''A Chorus Line'' with pimples (1:45). Circle in the Square, 254 West 50th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 
 Last Chance
 THE H. G. WELLS SCIENCE FICTION FESTIVAL This slick bit of radio theater will appeal mostly to science-fiction and horror buffs (1:15 each play). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)
 'THE LEOPARD AND THE FOX' Rajiv Joseph's examination of the ouster and eventual hanging of Pakistan's Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in the late 1970s is timely, sure. But, better than that, this taut ensemble effort is compelling and, for the most part, smart. TBG Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Saturday. (La Rocco)
 'NIGHTMARE: GHOST STORIES' This annual Lower East Side haunted house has some decent frights, though you may leave wishing there had been more. An accompanying maze, new this year, is disappointing (1:00). Clemente Soto Velez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, near Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (212) 868-4444; closes on Saturday. (Genzlinger) 
 'A VIEW FROM 151ST STREET' Bob Glaudini's modest, appealing drama for the Labyrinth Theater Company explores the aftermath of a shooting in Harlem with a minimum of sensationalism. Rich in gritty, honest and funny performances (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closes on Monday. (Isherwood)

 'A BRONX TALE'Chazz Palminteri stars in a revival of his one-man show from 1989 about growing up under the friendly tutelage of an Italian-American crime kingpin. Tamer than ''The Sopranos,'' certainly, but Mr. Palminteri's sweet, funny stroll down a memory lane peopled by scary men with silly nicknames is a pleasant diversion (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 
 'GREASE' A limp revival of a musical set in a high school that feels like a musical put on by a high school. Kathleen Marshall directs and choreographs a charisma-free ensemble, whose leads (Max Crumm and Laura Osnes) were cast via reality television (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Ben Brantley)
 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'MAURITIUS' Ersatz Mamet -- ''American Buffalo,'' to be exact. Theresa Rebeck's deftly formulaic drama about a power struggle over a rare stamp collection has the feeling of an expertly drawn blueprint on tracing paper. Doug Hughes directs a tasty cast that includes Alison Pill, Bobby Cannavale and F. Murray Abraham (2:00). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. 
 (Brantley) 
 'PYGMALION' David Grindley's misfired revival of Shaw's classic comedy pairs a de-sexed, infantile Henry Higgins (Jefferson Mays) with a hard-working but affectless Eliza Doolittle (Claire Danes). Chemistry? ''Not bloody likely,'' as Eliza would say. With excellent supporting performances from Boyd Gaines and Helen Carey (2:25). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)
 'THE RITZ' This oddly inert revival of Terrence McNally's risque 1975 farce set in a gay bathhouse demonstrates that yesterday's dirt is often today's dust. But it does feature a delicious turn by Rosie Perez as a talentless chanteuse, and Kevin Chamberlin as the evening's much put-upon straight man (1:55). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'SPRING AWAKENING' (Tony Award, best musical 2007) Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'XANADU' An improbably entertaining spoof of the majestically awful movie from 1980 about a Greek muse (Olivia Newton-John, roller-skating into oblivion) who inspires a young artist in Venice Beach, Calif., to chase his disco dream. Kerry Butler mimics Ms. Newton-John's Aussie accent and sports her signature skates-and-leg-warmers look, but also puts her own affectionate stamp on a seriously silly role. The impish playwright Douglas Carter Beane, who wrote the adaptation, also supplies great material for the domineering comic actresses Jackie Hoffman and Mary Testa. Blissfully idiotic, practically sublime (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 Off Broadway
 'BLACK WATCH' Gregory Burke's transfixing play from the National Theater of Scotland, inspired by interviews with soldiers who served in Iraq, is a glorious reminder of the transporting power of the theater. John Tiffany directs this seamless, haunting mix of drama, song and dance (1:50). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779. (Brantley) 
 'DIE MOMMIE DIE!' A happy play about haute homicide in Beverly Hills, written by Charles Busch, who also portrays the irresistibly evil has-been heroine. Mr. Busch manages to summon an entire host of over-the-hill screen sirens from the twilight of Hollywood's golden age (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)'A FEMININE ENDING' Sarah Treem's play is about an oboe player and aspiring composer trying to choose between pursuing a career and marriage to a pop star. An outmoded concept treated with minimal truthful detail. With Marsha Mason and Richard Masur as kooky parents (1:30). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)
 'FUERZABRUTA' A sensory bath aimed at clubgoing college kids in search of cultural diversion. Thumping techno music, smoke and a standing throng surround you as you watch a curious collection of semi-spectacular technical feats (1:05). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'GREETINGS FROM YORKVILLE' No theme is hardier in musical theater than that of the ingenue trying to break into the big time: In this slender but sweet musical, basically a glorified cabaret evening, the set-up has a veritable reality-show spin, since it is the true story of the people who wrote and are performing it (1:30). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Vandam Street, South Village, (212) 691-1555. (Anne Midgette) 
 'THE JOKE' Two comics working the Catskills in the 1960s and '70s gradually go in different directions, putting strains on their partnership, reminiscent of a doomed marriage, in this well-conceived two-hander by Sam Marks. Thomas Sadoski and Jordan Gelber play it with admirable verve (1:10). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-4500. (Neil Genzlinger) 
 'MASKED' A powerful play about three Palestinian brothers torn by the dilemma of accommodation or resistance to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Written by an Israeli, the play is a thoughtful and sobering drama that avoids political statements or moral judgments (1:25). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Wilborn Hampton) 
 'MILK-N-HONEY' This frequently entertaining primer on food politics is partly fiction and partly based on interviews with people like farmers, Dumpster divers and food chemists. The show has an appealing sense of mission, but it too earnestly wants to convince us that we are prisoners of American consumerism. On the plus side, you get candy (1:25). 3LD Art and Technology Center, 80 Greenwich Street, at Rector Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 388-7371. 
 (Rachel Saltz)'THE MISANTHROPE' The experimental Belgian-born director Ivo van Hove goes for the guts in this production, turning Moliere's courtly hypocrites into a wallowing, rutting, howling menagerie of beasts. Less a deconstruction than a detonation, but it does allow the excellent Bill Camp to find the tragic anguish in the title role (1:50). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley)
 'THE OVERWHELMING' J. T. Rogers's smart and honorable drama about blundering Americans in Rwanda presents a sprawling panorama of perspectives on a nation in turmoil. Fluidly directed by Max Stafford-Clark, the production never quite evokes lives that are real instead of representative (2:20). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'THE OXFORD ROOF CLIMBERS REBELLION' An excellent play about two famous soldier-scholars -- T. E. Lawrence and Robert Graves -- and their disillusionment with the British establishment over World War I, particularly the government's attempts to ennoble the slaughter known as the Great War. Although set in Oxford University in 1920, the play is as timely as today's newspaper (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Hampton) 
 'THE SENSUOUS WOMAN'Margaret Cho headlines an oddball burlesque review that mixes stand-up comedy (mostly gay) and stripping (a little of everything). Raunchy but only intermittently fun (1:30). Zipper Factory, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 
 'THREE MO' TENORS' Great opera it ain't, but there's kitschy fun and not too much that's cringe-inducing in this diverse musical vehicle for black tenors (2:00). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Claudia La Rocco) 
 'TINGS DEY HAPPEN' An engrossing one-man show about the Fulbright year its author and performer, Dan Hoyle, spent in Nigeria; in the spirit of theatrical journalism, it is at once a travelogue, a cultural survey and a good introductory course in oil politics. But it is the people the audience meets who raise the exercise above a guided tour (1:25). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. 
 (Hampton) 
 'VENGEANCE' Ron Fitzgerald's ''Rats,'' featuring a terrific performance by Michael Mosley as an unemployed adman with an unexpected visitor, is the high point of this entertaining bill of five new short plays, presented by stageFarm. Gina Gionfriddo's ''Squalor'' takes a skewed look at the search for Internet pedophiles, and ''Specter,'' by Neena Beber, is a daffy take on a certain record producer named Phil. Five actors do it all, impressively (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444.
 (Genzlinger) 
 Off Off Broadway
 'A GLANCE AT NEW YORK' Axis Company's daffy resurrection of this lowbrow stage work from 1848 seems, at 50 minutes, to go by in a heartbeat, and when it's over, you'll have no sense of what made the play so popular way back when. But you'll have been entertained by the company's assaultive delivery. The story involves a rube who comes to New York and is fleeced repeatedly, and a fireman named Mose who punches people (1:00). Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 
 Last Chance
 'THE LEOPARD AND THE FOX' Rajiv Joseph's examination of the ouster and eventual hanging of Pakistan's Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in the late 1970s is timely, sure. But, better than that, this taut ensemble effort is compelling and, for the most part, smart. TBG Theater, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes tomorrow. (La Rocco)
 'A VIEW FROM 151ST STREET' Bob Glaudini's appealing drama for the Labyrinth Theater Company explores the aftermath of a shooting in Harlem with a minimum of sensationalism (2:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555; closes on Monday. (Isherwood)

HEADLINE: Canadian Exporters Hurt By a Soaring Currency

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
The morning after the Canadian dollar climbed above its postwar high against the United States dollar, Robert Hattin, the president of a company that makes custom machinery to pack products as diverse as toilet paper, cough syrup and CDs, was not celebrating.
 For Mr. Hattin and other export-dependent manufacturers, the rise of the loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known, beyond its previous record of $1.0614 set in 1957 has become a major concern. It is also a worry that is likely to linger and worsen. While the Canadian dollar eventually dropped back to $1.0516 at the end of North American trading on Thursday, few, if any, economists say that its record-breaking streak is over. 
 ''I don't dare call it the end of things,'' said Douglas Porter, the deputy chief economist of BMO Capital Markets, a unit of the Bank of Montreal. ''Over the years we've seen currency go a lot longer and a lot further than many people thought reasonable.''
 Mr. Hattin's company, Edson Packaging Machinery, relies on customers in the United States for about 90 percent of the sales of its machines, which can cost $20 million. But there are no easy solutions for companies like Edson, which is based in Hamilton, Ontario, in dealing with a currency that has risen by about 70 percent over the last five years and 20 percent in the last 12 months alone.
 Several Canadian politicians, notably Jim Flaherty, Canada's finance minister, have suggested that manufacturers can use the Canadian dollar's newfound strength to purchase new technology from the United States that can reduce operating costs and increase productivity.
 But that is a notion that Mr. Hattin, who is investing in a major plant expansion to improve efficiency, finds overly simplistic.
 ''It's easy to say: 'Oh, let's invest in automation.' But the gains are incremental, and they don't happen quickly enough,'' he said.
 Like many manufacturers, Mr. Hattin is supplementing capital investments with limited price increases and by driving harder bargains with his suppliers. In that last effort, the strength of the Canadian dollar has been a help. Steel, for example, is priced in United States dollars worldwide.
 Reluctantly, Mr. Hattin is also now selling some machinery at a loss in the hope of recovering his costs through services and parts sales over the lifetime of the equipment, which is generally about 25 years.
 Several economists share Mr. Hattin's concerns.
 Craig Wright, the chief economist of the Royal Bank of Canada, noted that the Canadian dollar's rising value came at a time of high oil prices and intense competition from manufacturers in Asia.
 ''It has been a long string of negative factors,'' Mr. Wright said. Last month, the Royal Bank lowered its 2008 growth forecast for Ontario, the center of Canadian manufacturing, to 1.8 percent. In March, the provincial government had estimated 2.8 percent growth next year.
 This fall, Mr. Flaherty and the Canadian prime minister, Stephen Harper, have taken up the case of Canadians who complain that their currency's new value is not reflected in store prices.
 The government has been vague about how it can compel merchants to cut prices, but its campaign has had a limited effect already.
 On Thursday, Wal-MartCanada announced that it would sell books, magazines, gift wrap and greeting cards at the prices suggested for the United States. Those products have been a particular annoyance for consumers because they generally are marked with suggested prices for both countries, making for easy comparisons.
 Mr. Porter said luxury car makers had been reluctant to cut prices for fear of reducing used-car values, creating losses for their leasing units, which sell cars that have been leased. Instead, Audi Canada and BMWCanada recently started offering bargains in lease costs and loan rates.
 In advertising its financing deals, Audi could not resist taking on Mr. Flaherty.
 ''Finance Minister Flaherty, Your Car Is Ready,'' announced the headline on full-page newspaper advertisements from Audi that ran last weekend. In the ads, the company argued that it was unable to cut prices at the same pace as the Canadian dollar's rise.

HEADLINE: Tapping a Trickle In West Texas

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: CRANE, Texas 

 BODY:
The North McElroy oil field here in West Texas has long been a tableau of rusty tanks and worn-out pump jacks. ''Not in Use'' is painted across broken electrical panels affixed to an abandoned building.
 With oil prices setting records, years of neglect finally appear to be coming to an end. The Apache Corporation is drilling new wells. Workers are flocking to sparsely populated West Texas, living in motels and trailer parks. Dishwashers and teachers are fleeing their jobs for $60,000 gigs in the fields.
 But for all the new wealth and activity, the best the industry can hope to accomplish is to slow the decline of American oil production. The good times here are not nearly as good as they were in the last big oil boom in the 1970s and 1980s -- and nobody expects they will get that way, how ever high prices rise.
 ''Nobody's drinking Champagne or even beer out of cowboy boots this time,'' said Daniel Yergin, an oil historian and industry consultant. ''There's a sense of limited possibilities.'' 
 The big problem: the nation's oil fields are mostly tapped out. While modern technology is giving workers the ability to squeeze more crude out of wells in North McElroy and other oil patches around the country, overall output is on an intractable slide. In the United States, oil production has fallen in every one of the last six years, according to the government, even as prices quadrupled.
 Last year's production of 1.86 billion barrels of crude oil was the nation's lowest since 1949, and production, at best, will level off this year. 
 ''It's not a pretty picture,'' said Boone Pickens, the billionaire Texas oilman who has seen his share of booms and busts. ''People are making money and there are lots of jobs, but let's face it: we are in decline.''
 Not even an offshore oil boom in the Gulf of Mexico has been able to reverse the trend. New oil coming from there simply cannot replace the production being lost in played-out fields onshore. 
 Oil prices have been soaring, repeatedly setting records in recent weeks, and $100 oil looks plausible if not inevitable. That means the American industry has plenty of incentive to do what it can to slow the decline. Spending on exploration and development in the United States has tripled in recent years, to $90 billion a year, according to John S. Herold, an energy consulting firm.
 High in the Colorado Rockies, long-deserted towns are coming back to life amid a drilling surge. In Louisiana, sugar farms are having trouble finding workers because oil companies are snapping them up. 
 But even as old fields are revived, others peter out. The United States now imports about two-thirds of its oil, and the proportion keeps rising as Americans burn as much gasoline as ever. 
 These days, industry people still look back fondly to the 1970s and early 1980s, when surging oil prices unleashed a frenzy in the oil regions. Even with the rest of America on the economic ropes then, Texans counted their cash and displayed their pride.
 ''Freeze a Yankee, Drive 75'' was a popular bumper sticker, the line lifted from a song that went on, ''Cram them Yankees into little bitty cars while we drive around in limousines.''
 A bust followed the boom, of course, sending a lot of cocky Texans to bankruptcy court in their limos. 
 Now, industry people are picking their way through a more complicated landscape, cognizant not only that the good times could end but also that the nation's tenuous energy security depends in part on their success in staving off the decline of old fields. 
 ''You will have trouble finding anyone out here who will use the word boom,'' said Ben Shepperd, executive vice president of the Permian Basin Petroleum Association. ''Everybody calls it the 'B' word.''
 Oil is less a factor in the regional economy than it used to be. Texas remains the country's biggest oil producer, representing 20 percent of national output, but production has been declining steadily, from 444 million barrels in 2000 to 397 million last year.
 The nation's total oil production peaked at about 10 million barrels of day in 1970 and is now about half that. Recent declines have been most spectacular in Alaska, where production is half what it was a decade ago.
 With an expected boom of deep water production in the gulf and the re-engineering of old wells onshore, the Energy Department hopes that production could go as high as 5.94 million barrels a day in 2016, from 5.1 million today, but projects that it will decline from there.
 Crane is a small town in the middle of the most important oil region in American history, known as the Permian Basin, after the geologic period, more than 250 million years ago, when the oil-bearing rocks were laid down. In the early 20th century, the region produced oil geysers of the sort depicted in the James Dean movie ''Giant.'' Oil from the region powered the Allies in World War II, when the United States was the world's biggest producer by far.
 But there has been no geyser in these parts in decades. Oil fields can produce only so much before decline sets in, and that point is long past for most American fields. Across West Texas and into eastern New Mexico, wells that produced 200 barrels a day 40 years ago now manage only five or 10 barrels.
 During the oil spike of the late 1980s, Rolls Royce had a dealership in nearby Midland. It is gone now. The days when dentists dropped their practices to buy oil wells, and anybody who was anybody around these parts collected race cars and owned a plane, are over.
 But there are definite signs of recovery. At the North McElroy field here, production fell from 12,700 barrels a day in the 1970s to 2,800 barrels today. Suddenly, though with new investments by Apache, the decline has stopped.
 ''It was pretty lonely out here 10 years ago with $8 oil,'' Tom Voytovich, an Apache vice president, declared the other day as he gazed across a landscape of cactus, mesquite, tumbleweeds and drilling rigs. ''But at $80 or $100 a barrel, it's a cash cow.''
 The big oil companies that drove past booms have only modest interests left here. Their primary exploratory efforts are abroad these days, despite the political risks of drilling in places like Angola and Russia, because that is where the big, new fields are. Picking over the leftovers of past booms are independent companies like Occidental Petroleum, Apache, XTO Energy, Devon Energy and Range Resources. 
 They rework old fields by drilling deeper, drilling sideways and repositioning wells. They shoot sound waves into the rock to create three-dimensional underground maps. They pump water or carbon dioxide into the ground to repressurize fields and recover more oil.
 Occasionally they get lucky. Range Resources spent $30 million in 1997 on an old field outside Andrews, Tex., and found that in past decades Conoco drilled a water injection well in the wrong place and then neglected to drill new producing wells in the right places.
 Range Resources fixed the problems and has increased production markedly, from 290 barrels a day to 3,500 barrels. The expansion is part of a broader recovery around Andrews marked by rising housing prices, new restaurants, a new furniture store that specializes in rural Italian decor, and so many new service businesses that one trucking company in town has named itself ''Just Another Trucking Company.''
 ''I'm very happy with the oil prices,'' said Arabella Flores, owner of Bella Interior and Lighting, whose Tuscan tables and cabinets are the newest addition to West Texas style. ''I wouldn't mind if they go higher.'' 
 The workers at the Range Resources field are grateful too, of course, but cautious in their optimism. Richard Cortinas, a 41-year-old production supervisor, said he would happy if the price stays stable for 20 years so he can retire. He used his stock options to buy a used Hummer eight months ago, but not before he agreed to a demand by his wife that he first pay off the mortgage.
 ''If oil goes down to $8 and I lose my job,'' he said, ''I've got a place to stay.''

HEADLINE: Income Data Hints at Underlying Economic Strength

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Personal income and spending continued to grow in September, a government report showed yesterday, suggesting strength in the economy even as analysts feared widespread troubles in the next few months. 
 Still, consumption began to slow, and manufacturers might be starting to feel the effects of a tightening housing market.
 Personal spending, which accounts for two-thirds of the gross domestic product, grew at 0.3 percent in September, a slight decline from the 0.5 percent growth in August, the Commerce Department said yesterday. 
 Spending was up 5.6 percent over the last 12 months, probably bolstered by a comparable rise in personal income, which has increased 6.8 percent over the last year. 
 Income rose 0.4 percent last month after an identical gain in August. Growth in disposable income, a measure of the money employees take home after taxes, dipped to 0.4 percent from 0.5 percent in August.
 The report offered few surprises, though it could provide some comfort to economists who predict a decline in economic growth in the fourth quarter. Analysts are waiting for a worsening housing recession to make its way into the broader economy, but for now consumers appear to be comfortable with opening their wallets. 
 The personal consumption expenditures index, an inflation gauge closely watched by the Federal Reserve, also stayed steady. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 1.8 percent on an annual basis, keeping pace with a downward trend over six months. 
 But overall inflation, as measured by the personal consumption expenditures deflator, is up 2.4 percent for the year, above the Fed's so-called comfort zone of 1 percent to 2 percent. That rise, compared with 1.8 percent in August, most likely reflected the surging cost of crude oil, which pushes up gasoline and energy prices. 
 Meanwhile, manufacturers reported their worst month since March, with American companies hurt by a decline in production coupled with a rise in costs. A closely watched manufacturing index dropped to 50.9 from 52 in September, the Institute for Supply Management said today, keeping pace with four months of declines. 
 Inventories jumped and new orders dipped slightly, while production levels fell below 50, indicating contraction. But export orders remained high, bolstered by a weak dollar that attracts foreign buyers.
 On the job front, new unemployment claims dipped 1.8 percent last week, though continuing claims rose by 65,000, or 2.6 percent. The numbers are highly volatile and can swing sharply from week to week, but taken together the reports suggest that a downturn in the labor market has yet to materialize.
 A fuller picture of the employment situation will come today when the Labor Department releases its October payroll report.

HEADLINE: As Beaches Erode, So Do Solutions

BYLINE: By CHRIS DIXON

 BODY:
OVER the last decade or more, federal and state funds to restore beach sand have become increasingly scarce, as government officials, taxpayers and environmentalists have argued against spending hundreds of millions of public dollars for projects that often wash away after a few strong storms. 
 This has left Atlantic and Gulf Coast communities to develop their own solutions, often imposing what are referred to as sand taxes. But the potential for assessments of thousands of dollars -- particularly in towns filled with vacation homes -- has created a divisive issue that many homeowners, voters and elected officials have yet to solve. 
 Over the last several weeks, a series of potent gales has swept huge quantities of sand from Southeastern beaches, leaving a critical situation for some homeowners. A drive from the Outer Banks of North Carolina to Charleston, S.C., makes it evident that easy solutions have yet to emerge. 
 On North Topsail Beach, N.C., an 11-mile stretch of barrier island, condemned houses rise from the surf line at the island's north end. Standing on the deck of a modest home surrounded by dilapidated properties, Rebecca Hodges said that she voted for a $34 million referendum in November 2006, even though she was not sure if she and her husband, Robert, could afford an annual assessment in excess of $3,000. 
 ''The price scares me,'' she said. ''But losing the beach scares me even more.''
 Despite threatened homes, voters turned down the referendum, 74 to 26 percent. Later, some homeowners and town aldermen argued that the vote was not representative because of 723 registered voters, only 356 cast votes. This decided the fate of more than 2,000 property owners, many of whom live out of town.
 The measure, and an effort by some aldermen to secure money for sand replacement through property tax funds, has split the town. 
 ''It's pitted neighbor against neighbor,'' said Dick Macartney, a beachfront resident of 15 years, a member of the town's Beach Renourishment Committee and a candidate for mayor in a pending election on Nov. 6. ''We don't need that when most of us are retired.''
 Mr. Macartney backed the initial referendum and said that now he would embrace nearly any plan, even one that levied an even higher fee on beachfront homeowners.
 ''All boats rise when property values go up,'' he said. ''It's much better to have a stable front row on the beach.''
 The issue of who pays -- people whose homes actually sit on the beachfront, as opposed to everyone who uses the beach -- is a constant.
 Richard Farley, an alderman in North Topsail, noted that the feeling among some along the beachfront was ''whatever rate was put forth, it should be applied equally.''
 ''The argument is that we all benefit the same from the beach,'' Mr. Farley said. ''But I think it's a matter of risk. If someone opts to live a few blocks back, is it right to go to them and say, 'You have an erosion problem'?''
 IN the past, money for sand came largely from federal and state funds, with local communities often asked to bear 5 to 10 percent. But according to Penny Schmitt, a spokeswoman for the Wilmington, N.C., office of the Army Corps of Engineers, the financing process is complicated and both the Clinton and Bush administrations have been reluctant to agree to new projects. They have even questioned paying for long-term maintenance projects in larger towns like Wrightsville Beach, N.C. 
 She said the corps might pay for the majority of a sand replenishment project if Congress and the president agreed that in the event of a catastrophic storm, the sand would provide substantial protection and savings to taxpayers. It might also pay if it were determined that a corps project -- say, a jetty, a seawall or channel dredging -- had robbed a beach of its sand.
 ''What's going on now,'' she said, ''is kind of a subterranean debate: Do we want to build shoreline protection projects as a nation, or don't we? And if the nation doesn't want to pay for it, then who should?'' 
 Because smaller communities often have higher flood risks, less political clout or private beaches, they are increasingly being forced to pay for new sand themselves. 
 In Emerald Isle, N.C., about 40 miles up the coast from North Topsail, Charles Vincent long reveled in the wide beach that protected the vacation home he built in 1977. But by the late 1990s, that shoreline was scoured.
 ''We had five hurricanes in four years, and they tore at the beach pretty badly,'' said Mr. Vincent, a retired American Airlines pilot.
 By 1999, Mr. Vincent was left with a narrow beach in front of his home, while many Emerald Isle beach houses had been demolished or stood in the surf. ''I said to myself that I'd better get involved now, because I'm also going to need help sooner or later,'' he said.
 Mr. Vincent and his neighbors quickly realized that help might not come from government, so they joined a homeowners group, later named the Bogue Banks Beach Preservation Association. In 2001, this group convinced voters in three towns along Bogue Banks, a fragile 30-mile-long sandbar, to spend nearly $30 million to pump dredged sand onto area beaches.
 The association cobbled together a plan that for eight years would levy an annual ''beach renourishment'' tax of 48 cents for $100 of value on Emerald Isle's beachfront homes, and 3 cents on those from the second row back. This translated to roughly $4,800 a year on a million-dollar beachfront house, and $150 for a $500,000 inland property. Two other towns, Pine Knoll Shores and Indian Beach, passed similar measures. 
 Since 2001, around 8.5 million cubic yards -- enough to bury a 150-mile-long two-lane highway under 11 feet of sand -- have been pumped onto the beaches. ''It made sense economically to nourish the beach and keep it in good, healthy condition,'' Mr. Vincent said.
 William Fugate, another Emerald Isle homeowner, said: ''Emerald Isle's property alone was recently evaluated to be worth $8 billion. When you consider that, a $30 million investment is a bargain.''
 Mr. Fugate said homeowners must do a better job convincing local, state and federal officials that wide beaches attract business, and the beach properties generate substantial tax revenue. But barring outside help, he said, the reality is that sand replacement will increasingly be financed locally. ''If you want to hold on,'' he said, ''it's getting to where you have to pay, or watch it fall in.''
 BUT not everyone is willing to pay. In 2001, the Army Corps of Engineers approved a 14-mile-long, $94 million sand replacement project in badly eroded Nags Head, N.C. But the sand has yet to flow because federal money never materialized. 
 In response, Dare County commissioners passed a countywide 1 percent sales tax to rebuild the beach. County voters threw it out. Then last April, Nags Head voters rejected a plan to levy 39 cents per $100 in value on beachfront homes and 5 cents on homes not on the beach. 
 Debbie Hill, a social worker from Hillsborough, N.C., near Raleigh, is an owner of a beachfront Nags Head cottage that has been moved back from the advancing Atlantic three times. But she opposed the Nags Head referendum because, she said, beach replacement damages the environment and has shown no lasting benefit. 
 ''Beach renourishment is just throwing money into the sea,'' she said. ''The sand doesn't stay.'' 
 Down the coast in South Carolina, a pair of vacation communities have grappled with erosion with different results. Just south of Pawleys Island, 1,223 property owners in Debordieu, a private development, took matters into their own hands in 2005. Faced with an ocean surging into the yards of multimillion-dollar homes, a beachfront resident, Ray Chandler, helped organize a tiered $6.2 million, 600,000-cubic-yard plan that charged owners of the most-threatened homes a one-time fee as high as $40,000, while those well inland paid roughly $2,300. 
 Fifty miles south of Debordieu, the private Wild Dunes resort sprawls across the northern end of Charleston County's Isle of Palms. Over the last year, beaches have disappeared in front of the golf course and several condominiums. At the oceanfront Seascape complex there, the pool has been breached by ocean waters. 
 When erosion first threatened Seascape, state regulators allowed frantic homeowners to place thousands of small sandbags to hold back the ocean and hold in what sand remained. These promptly washed southward; 1,700 larger sandbags that replaced them provide a temporary solution.
 John O'Hare, president of the Seascape homeowner association, said that owners of his and other threatened condos at Wild Dunes would happily pay the estimated $6 million for dredging but that hurdles remain. Over five years ago, a permit was requested to move sand from a dune to replenish the beach. Environmentalists threatened to sue. 
 More recently, the condo owners' association was given preliminary state approval to truck sand to the beach. But homeowners fear this smaller fix -- far costlier per cubic yard than dredging -- may not be adequate, particularly since the sandbags must be removed first.
 When Mr. O'Hare bought at Wild Dunes 22 years ago, he said that no one informed him of such an erosion threat. 
 ''I had no idea,'' he said by phone from his main home in Guilford, Conn. ''I was 45 years old, and I worked hard to scrape a few bucks to pay for this place. People say, 'Oh, they're all rich; let it fall into the ocean'. But I'm not rich, and to let this place fall into the ocean would be an ecological disaster.''

HEADLINE: Africa's Chance

 BODY:
Amid an AIDS epidemic, against the drumbeat of regional conflicts, overshadowed by the most abject poverty, it is easy to miss the glimmer of hope in sub-Saharan Africa. Rising prices of raw materials are helping the region achieve its best economic performance since independence. 
 This vitality has fragile foundations. Africa's past commodity booms turned to busts, which means Africans must carefully manage their resources. The United States and others must not use the good news as an excuse to shirk their commitments to the region. 
 In 2005, the Group of 8 leading industrialized nations pledged to increase aid to Africa by at least $25 billion by 2010. Since then, according to the International Monetary Fund, official grants to sub-Saharan Africa have actually declined as a share of its economy. That is shameful. 
 If Africa's growth is to be self-sustaining, the wealthy countries must also end their most harmful subsidies on products like cotton and sugar, and aggressively expand market access for the products that African countries can export competitively, like textiles and shoes. Not only do the offers on the table in global trade negotiations fall short of what is needed, the talks seem at risk of collapsing over disagreements between rich nations and the bigger developing countries.
 Growth in sub-Saharan Africa is expected to exceed five percent this year, which would be its fifth year in a row of doing so. That's because of the surging price of oil -- a boon for Nigeria and Angola -- and rising demand for metals like copper and aluminum that benefit nonoil exporters. Africa has gained substantially from debt reduction. That has freed resources for public investment and underpinned a surge of private foreign investment. 
 Resource-hungry China has quickly become the region's second-largest trading partner after the United States -- and an important investor. There is a dark side to China's role -- providing financing and political support to despots like Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe or Sudan's Omar Hassan al-Bashir -- but it is becoming an important engine for the region's economy. 
 Africa is still dirt poor -- with an average annual income per capita of merely $600 and 300 million people living in poverty. Every year, nearly a million children die of malaria and more than two million die before they are a month old. 
 The region is also still locked in the vulnerable role as a supplier of basic commodities. That means its growth will falter if, say, China's economy cools and its demand for raw materials wanes. Over the long term, Africa must move its way up the chain of commodity exports and into the worldwide networks of manufacturing that account for a growing share of global trade.
 The immediate challenge requires investment to deal with historic bottlenecks: dismal health, poor education and derelict infrastructure, notably in transportation and power generation. And it must invest in bringing new technology to agriculture, an essential step to combat entrenched poverty in rural areas. Western aid will be crucial for making progress in all these areas. 
 Nobody can know for certain whether Africa south of the Sahara might be on the cusp of shaking its endemic destitution and starting up the ladder of development. But it has its best chance in decades, and it would be a crime not to try to grasp this opportunity.

HEADLINE: Sales at Ford Decrease for the 12th Month in a Row

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company posted its 12th consecutive monthly decline yesterday, while General Motors and Toyota Motor each gained market share in the United States in October on higher truck sales.
 At Chrysler, which said earlier in the day that it would cut 11,000 more jobs and discontinue four vehicles, truck sales plummeted 18 percent, according to the Autodata Corporation, the industry statistics firm.
 Ford's sales fell 13 percent from the same period in 2006 on an adjusted basis, according to Autodata. The automaker had projected that sales would be down on a year-over-year basis for every month of 2007 because it was intentionally cutting back on less profitable sales to rental car companies. 
 Such sales decreased by 12,000 vehicles, or 38 percent, in October to a total of 142,000 since January. But Ford dealerships also made fewer sales, dropping the company's market share to 14.7 percent, from 16.5 percent a year ago.
 Both G.M. and Chrysler increased sales to rental car companies and other fleet customers, but Chrysler's market share still fell to 11.8 percent from 13.1 percent.
 G.M.'s sales were down slightly, when adjusted for one additional selling day, but its share rose to 24.8 percent, from 24.2 percent, widening its lead over second-place Toyota. Toyota's share climbed to 16 percent, from 15.5 percent. 
 Although recent interest rate reductions by the Federal Reserve could encourage some consumers to finance a new vehicle, experts say they do not see a significantly brighter outlook for the industry anytime soon.
 ''Recent consumer confidence readings suggest we don't have a lot of momentum heading into the final quarter of this year,'' said Emily Kolinski Morris, a senior economist at Ford.
 Edmunds.com, a Web site that gives car-buying advice to consumers, predicts no major improvements at least through 2010.
 ''It's going to be very, very competitive,'' said Jesse Toprak, executive director for industry analysis for Edmunds. ''Whoever can design the best cars will succeed. It's going to be a buyer's market.''
 G.M. and Toyota were the only two major automakers to post increases in truck sales. Ford's light truck sales fell 2.6 percent, according to Autodata.
 Chrysler sales fell 12.4 percent while G.M. sales fell 0.4 percent. Toyota sales rose 0.5 percent. Over all, industry sales declined 2.7 percent last month.
 Toyota and the other Japanese makers, Honda and Nissan, were affected by the huge wildfires in California, which hindered sales in one of their biggest markets. Toyota executives said the fires, which had led to the evacuation of more than a million people, probably prevented or delayed ''a couple thousand'' sales.
 Still, Toyota said that it was on track to reach its goal of selling 200,000 Tundra pickups by the end of the year. Through October, the company sold 162,348 Tundras. The pickup was redesigned in February, and dealerships recently started receiving the 2008 model, with a sticker price reduced by as much as $2,000 on some trim options.
 The Detroit automakers are counting on several new vehicles to help them overcome the sluggish market.
 On Thursday, G.M. began selling its redesigned Chevrolet Malibu, a midsize car that it hopes will challenge the segment-leading Toyota Camry and Honda Accord. G.M.'s revamped Cadillac CTS upscale sedan made a strong showing in October, with sales rising 75 percent.
 Last month, Ford started selling a new version of the Focus, a compact sedan that is the first to feature Sync, a voice-activated system that can control a driver's cellphone and digital music player, developed with Microsoft.
 Ford also hopes that its Edge crossover vehicle, which was introduced nearly a year ago, will continue to gain momentum. The Edge was Ford's top-selling vehicle in October, excluding the F-series pickup truck.
 Although none of those vehicles can individually reverse decades of declines in market share, they are more meaningful than their absolute sales numbers suggest, Mr. Toprak of Edmunds, said.
 ''Sometimes you need these cars that are success stories to get people back into the showrooms,'' he said. ''One or two hits out there can enable a turnaround for an automaker. If you have these hits more often, that's what's going to bring you success.''

HEADLINE: 'There Are No Good Options in Iraq'

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview by Michael R. Gordon and Jeff Zeleny of The New York Times with Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, conducted on Wednesday afternoon at his campaign headquarters in Chicago. Some questions have been edited for brevity and clarity, and extraneous material omitted. The full interview: nytimes.com/politics. 
 QUESTION. What is your schedule for withdrawing forces from Iraq? How fast would these withdrawals be carried out? What time frame? 
 ANSWER. Based on the conversations we've had internally as well as external reports, we believe that you can get one to two brigades out a month. At that pace, the forces would be out in approximately 16 months from the time that we began. That would be the time frame that I would be setting up. That also gives us time to make sure that we are strengthening the Iraqi forces. Obviously, I would prefer that we start this process now, but let's assume that there are 100,000 troops when I get there, that means that we're talking 14 to 15 months from now. 
 According to all the reports, we should have been well along our way in getting the Iraqi security forces to be more functional. We then have another 16 months after that to adjust the withdrawal and make sure that we are withdrawing from those areas, based on advice from the military officers in the field, those places where we are secured, made progress and we're not just willy-nilly removing troops, but we're making a determination -- in this region we see some stability. 
 Q. If you saw that the Iraqi government, under the duress of American withdrawals, was not making progress or if sectarian violence was beginning to increase in Iraq, would you call a halt to withdrawals or proceed anyway?
 A. I think that it is important to understand that there are no good options in Iraq. There haven't been for a very long time. I've said previously that I would not be surprised to see some spikes in violence as we begin the withdrawal. It is not going to be a perfectly smooth transition. But I think there is a way of managing this that keeps this violence contained. Now, at some point the Iraqis are going to have to respond to a change in the security situation inside Iraq, one way or another, and those in the region are going to have to respond as well. 
 During that 16 months, I'm engaging in very systematic, tough diplomacy, not just with the various factions in the region, but also with Iran, with Syria, the Saudis, Jordan, with the United Nations Security Council program members. Once it's clear that we are not intending to stay there for 10 years or 20 years, all these parties have an interest in figuring out how do we adjust in a way that stabilizes the situation. ... What I don't want to do is to make our withdrawal contingent on the Iraqi government doing the right thing, because that empowers them to make strategic decisions that should be made by the president of the United States. 
 Q. What assurances would you offer [Iran and Syria] to get them to be more cooperative -- try to convince them that the U.S. would not pursue regime change?
 A. There are a series of serious problems that we have. Iraq is one. Their development of nuclear weapons is another. Their support of terrorist activities -- Hezbollah and Hamas are a third. On all these fronts, we've got severe issues with their actions. We expect them to desist from those actions, but what we are also willing to say is as a consequence of their changes in behavior, we are willing to examine their membership in the W.T.O., we are willing to look at how can we assure that they've got the kinds of economic relationships that can help grow their economy. 
 We are willing to talk about certain assurances in the context of them showing some good faith. I think it is important for us to send a signal that we are not hellbent on regime change, just for the sake of regime change, but expect changes in behavior. And there are both carrots and there are sticks available to them for those changes in behavior. Where those conversations go is not yet clear, but what is absolutely clear is that the path that we are on now is not going to make our troops in Iraq safer. Iran has shown no inclination to back off of their support of Shia militias as a consequence of the threats that they've been receiving from the Bush and Cheney administration. If anything, it probably accelerates their interest in trying to make a situation in Iraq as uncomfortable as possible for us.

HEADLINE: A War Game Supposes Scarce and Risky Oil

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
War in Iran. Gasoline rationing, at $5 a gallon. A military draft. A Chinese takeover of Taiwan. Double-digit inflation and unemployment. The draining of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
 This is where current energy policy is leading us, according to a nightmare scenario played out as a policy-making exercise here on Thursday by a group of former top government officials.
 Two bipartisan business-supported groups sponsored an elaborately staged role-playing game called Oil ShockWave that tried to dramatize the impact of American dependence on oil imported from unstable and unfriendly parts of the world. 
 The organizers have an agenda: They hope to prompt Congress to act on energy legislation and to push the issue into the presidential campaign. 
 The game was set in the spring and summer of 2009, under a new administration that has inherited current energy policy. 
 The match that ignited the conflagration was $150-a-barrel oil, brought on first by instability in Central Asia and then a military and political confrontation with Iran and Venezuela. 
 The president's senior advisers -- played by former White House aides, military leaders and cabinet officers, met urgently to try to fashion advice for the president to cope with the political, economic, social and military effects of the oil shock. The president, of unspecified party affiliation, remained offstage throughout but was consistently referred to as ''he.'' 
 The group was led by the national security adviser, played by Robert E. Rubin, secretary of the Treasury during much of the Clinton administration. At one point, weighing a variety of unpleasant options, Mr. Rubin said in near despair, ''This wouldn't be this big a problem if the political system a few years ago had dealt with these issues.''
 Carol M. Browner, the Democratic former head of the Environmental Protection Agency, who played the secretary of energy, chimed in, ''Year in and year out, it has been difficult to get a serious energy policy.'' She and others noted that previous Congresses failed to act on auto mileage standards, efficiency measures and steps to replace foreign sources of oil. Michael D. McCurry, President Clinton's former press secretary, who played a senior counselor to the fictional new president, said that energy issues were barely discussed in the 2008 campaign.
 That is the moral of the story, according to its organizers. Congressional inaction and political inattention could lead to dire, yet completely foreseeable consequences.
 ''Once a crisis actually hits, policy tools are largely ineffectual,'' said Jason S. Grumet, president of the Bipartisan Policy Center, one of the event's sponsors. ''The participants recognized that Congress has to get out in front on oil security before events overtake it.''
 The other sponsor was Securing America's Future Energy, or SAFE, an action-oriented group committed to reducing the nation's dependence on oil. It is led by Frederick W. Smith, the chairman of FedEx, and retired Gen. P. X. Kelley, former commandant of the Marine Corps.
 Both groups have issued numerous reports on American oil policy and have urged Congress to act quickly to reduce the demand for oil, increase supplies from reliable sources and reduce economic dependence on fossil fuels.
 Thursday's exercise, the organizers acknowledge, was a bit of a stunt to publicize the issues and nudge Congress and the presidential candidates.
 All the former policy makers recruited for the cast got promotions, except Mr. Rubin. ''Life can be cruel,'' said he remarked.
 Richard L. Armitage, deputy secretary of state in President Bush's first term, moved up to secretary of state. Retired Gen. John P. Abizaid, former head of the Pentagon's Central Command, played the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. John F. Lehman, secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration, became secretary of defense. Gene Sperling, former national economic adviser to President Clinton, was the secretary of the Treasury. Philip D. Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 commission, served as the fictional director of national intelligence.
 The only leading participant not to have held a senior government post was Daniel Yergin, an expert on the oil industry and chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
 The official surrogates sat in a mock-up of a White House situation room and considered the options for dealing with an uprising in Azerbaijan that had cut the flow of oil through the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline. As oil prices rose past $110 a barrel, they discussed what the president should say and do. Ms. Browner, as the fictional energy secretary, suggested reimposing the national 55-mile-an-hour speed limit. The political advisers rejected that as an ''eat your peas'' proposal that would not go over well in Congress or with the public.
 Surveying the financial markets, which were plunging as oil prices spiked, Mr. Rubin fell back on a favorite phrase as a top Wall Street executive and government official: ''Markets go up and markets go down.''
 Much of the discussion echoed the current debate over the run-up in real-world energy prices. ''Is this a short-term spike or a long-term economic reality?'' Mr. McCurry asked. No one had an answer.
 When the group reassembled, it was a few months later, and the crisis had deepened. Iran had drastically cut its oil production in response to Western economic sanctions imposed because of its nuclear weapons program. The Venezuelan leadership of Hugo Chavez followed suit, driving prices beyond $150 a barrel. The Iranian nuclear program touched off talk of war. The military advisers urged redeployment of the bulk of America's naval and air power to the Persian Gulf in anticipation of war, and urged reinstatement of the draft for young men and women.
 Domestic policy advisers recommended limited releases from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and mandatory fuel-saving measures, like gasoline rationing and limits to Sunday driving.
 Mr. McCurry said the president realized that he had no good choices. ''He knows he's a one-term president because of this,'' he said. 
 Robbie Diamond, president of SAFE, said the exercise demonstrated the economic and national security costs of the American dependence on foreign oil.
 ''Now they have the opportunity on Capitol Hill to truly rise above ideology and enact a comprehensive energy bill that meaningfully reduces our oil dependence,'' he said. ''Without measures that address both supply and demand, they have failed the American people.''

HEADLINE: Gates Says Iran Gave Assurances On Explosives

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates indicated Thursday that Iran had told the Baghdad government that it would work to stem the flow of high-powered explosives into Iraq, though he also questioned the credibility of the pledge. 
 ''It is my understanding that they have provided such assurances,'' Mr. Gates said during a Pentagon news conference. ''I don't know whether to believe them. I'll wait and see.''
 Those comments came the same day the No. 2 American commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, said that the number of lethal roadside bombs suspected to have origins in Iran had declined in recent months.
 General Odierno, in a video news conference from his headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad to reporters at the Pentagon, said it was premature to declare that the decrease in armor-piercing roadside bombs, called explosively formed penetrators, or E.F.P.'s, meant Iran had taken steps to halt their flow into Iraq.
 Mr. Gates said that statistics on violence in Iraq provided mounting evidence that the security situation was improving, though he acknowledged that political progress was slow at the national level of the Iraqi government.
 ''We have certainly been successful in significantly improving the security situation in Iraq, and I would say that what we need to do is continue this effort and ensure that the economic reconstruction and development follows,'' Mr. Gates said. ''We clearly have more work to do with the police, as do the Iraqis, and we still need to get some of this basic legislation.''
 Asked whether he would declare that the United States was now winning the war in Iraq, Mr. Gates responded: ''I think those end up being loaded words. I think we have been very successful. We need to continue being successful.''
 The United States military contends that E.F.P. components are made in Iran and supplied to Shiite militias in Iraq. Iran denies that it is involved in shipping weapons to the militias.
 But Mr. Gates said he believed that leaders of the Quds force, an elite element of Iran's Revolutionary Guards, knew about the weapons smuggling, adding that he also believed that top levels of the Iranian government were ''probably'' aware of it, too. ''I haven't seen anything that is definitive along those lines,'' Mr. Gates said. ''My guess is that the highest levels are aware.''
 In describing the security situation in Iraq to reporters at the Pentagon, General Odierno said the number of E.F.P.'s found across the country in the past three months was down sharply.
 In October, there were 53 E.F.P. incidents in Iraq, according to General Odierno, with 30 attacks involving the weapons and 23 others in which E.F.P.'s were found before they detonated. He compared those figures with those of July, when there were 99 E.F.P. incidents over all; August, when there were 78; and September, 52. The current monthly level is still above the monthly levels of the first quarter of the year, he added.
 ''Although we still have, in my mind, way too many,'' General Odierno said of the E.F.P.'s, ''in the last few months that has been on a downward trend.''

HEADLINE: Mayor Weighs Pupil Rewards Of Free Phones and Airtime

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA; Diane Cardwell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said yesterday that he was considering a proposal to give some city students free cellphones and to reward high performance with free airtime, but emphasized that he had no intention of lifting the ban on cellphones in the schools. 
 ''It's something we'll take a look at,'' the mayor said of the proposal being pushed by Roland G. Fryer, a Harvard economist who joined the Education Department this year as chief equality officer. But, he added, ''We have absolutely no intention whatsoever of letting students use cellphones'' in schools. ''That's not what that proposal was all about.'' 
 Dr. Fryer is also the architect of the city's plan to pay cash to students in several dozen schools who do well on standardized tests, a step connected to the mayor's broad antipoverty efforts that give families money as a reward for certain behavior. Dr. Fryer spoke of the cellphone plan during a lecture to his undergraduate economics class last month. 
 Mayor Bloomberg suggested that the plan would not necessarily collide with the ban, which has come under continued attack from parents and politicians in the city because the phones would not be used in schools.
 ''Right now you can -- if you have the money -- you can pay for your own cellphone and use it outside of school,'' the mayor said yesterday after giving a speech on land use. ''We have no jurisdiction nor any interest in prohibiting your using a cellphone outside of school.''
 Councilman Lewis A. Fidler, who sponsored a bill to try to loosen the cellphone ban by requiring schools to allow students to carry phones to and from school, said the proposal was ''almost funny.'' 
 ''The fact that they even would think that this might be a powerful incentive for students is delicious,'' Mr. Fidler said. ''It's a clear indication that people at a level below the mayor and the chancellor realize that this is a vital piece of technology.''
 The schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, speaking at the Education Department's headquarters yesterday, said that the proposal was a long way from being adopted and was just one of several ideas being considered. 
 ''We go through a process, and if we decide to approve it we'll let you know,'' he said. ''We're looking at a whole bunch of incentive programs, and certainly that's what we're trying to do -- think about ways to engage students, particularly students who seem disengaged.''

HEADLINE: Britain Praises Iraqi Kurds' Efforts to End Crisis

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: SALAHUDDIN, Iraq, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
While Turkish and American officials have stepped up criticism of Iraqi Kurdish leaders for failing to curb the guerrilla fighters who have sanctuary in northern Iraq, a top British official lent his support to the Kurdish regional government during a visit on Thursday and indicated that he was confident of its commitment to resolving the crisis. 
 The British defense secretary, Des Browne, appeared here at a news conference with Massoud Barzani, the Kurdish leader of northern Iraq. Mr. Browne said that he had seen ''a serious commitment to implement a range of measures which will make a difference.''
 Mr. Browne's comments stood in contrast to remarks last week by the State Department's senior Iraq adviser, David M. Satterfield, that the United States was ''not pleased with the lack of action'' shown by Kurdish leaders. 
 Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey was quoted this week accusing Mr. Barzani of ''aiding and abetting'' the Kurdish guerrilla group, the Kurdistan Workers' Party.
 The guerrillas' bloody cross-border attacks on Turkish forces have put enormous political pressure on Turkish leaders to show that they are taking swift action against the rebels. Turkish military forces are now massed at the Iraqi border for a potential invasion, though Turkish officials have suggested that no action will be taken before Mr. Erdogan meets with President Bush in Washington next week.
 And while Turkish officials contend that a Turkish attack only on guerrilla bases in northern Iraq would not be an ''invasion,'' Mr. Browne suggested that the British government wanted no form of Turkish offensive inside Iraq.
 ''The whole focus of our efforts and the advantage of me being here today is that I can make a contribution to the collective efforts to ensure that no such cross-border operation ever takes place,'' Mr. Browne said.
 Turkish officials also said Thursday that they had initiated economic sanctions against the Kurdish guerrillas, though they did not say what the sanctions were or how they could frame them to affect only the guerrillas. 
 The Iraqi Kurds depend on imports from Turkey for electricity, food and other critical needs, and they fear that the closing of trade routes would be devastating. Mr. Barzani said that Turkey had just closed its airspace to flights headed toward northern Iraq, but Turkish officials denied taking that step.

HEADLINE: Sweet, Bloody Smell of Success

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
Greatness hovers just outside ''American Gangster,'' knocking, angling to be let in. Based in rough outline on the flashy rise and fall of a powerful 1970s New York drug lord, Frank Lucas, the film has been built for importance, with a brand-name director, Ridley Scott, and two major stars, Denzel Washington as Lucas, and Russell Crowe as Richie Roberts, the New Jersey cop who brings him down. It's a seductive package, crammed with all the on-screen and off-screen talent that big-studio money can buy, and filled with old soul and remixed funk that evoke the city back in the day, when heroin turned poor streets white and sometimes red. 
 This being an American story, as its title announces and Steven Zaillian's screenplay occasionally trumpets, there's plenty of blue in the mix too, worn by some of New York's very un-finest. Mr. Lucas was among the city's most notorious underworld hustlers, but one of the film's points (at times you could call it a message) is that he was just doing what everyone with ambition, flair and old-fashioned American entrepreneurial spirit was doing, including cops: getting a piece of the action. His piece just happened to be bigger than most, stretching across Harlem and snaking into other neighborhoods, into alleys and apartments where someone with ready cash and a hungry vein was always aching to get high.
 You see a few of those veins, popping, all but jumping in anticipation of another hit. Sometimes the needle slides into a clean arm, though every so often the camera comes uncomfortably close as a spike jabs into a suppurating wound. You could call these images metaphoric, something about the oozing, bleeding body of the exploited underclass, but mostly they're just graphic evidence of the damage done. Despite the intermittent nod to someone nodding out and even dying, this isn't about the suffering of addicts or of those forced to watch their neighborhoods perish alongside them. It's about good guys and bad, a classic story of white hats and black squaring off at the corral at 116th Street and Eighth Avenue. 
 Mr. Crowe, his jaw thrust forward as aggressively as his pelvis, wears the white hat, while the silky, smooth-moving, smooth-talking Mr. Washington wears the black. They're irresistible, though neither possesses the movie because each occupies a separate if parallel story line. Mr. Washington has the more developed and dynamic role, which he inhabits easily, whether flashing his wolfish grin or draining the affect from Lucas's face to show the soulless operator beneath the swagger and suit. Lucas's rival, Nicky Barnes (Cuba Gooding Jr. in a sharp, small turn), wore the pimp threads and fedoras the size of manhole covers (he also read Machiavelli). Lucas dressed like the businessman he believed himself to be and was. 
 Formally, the plot takes the shape of a simple braid, with Lucas's and Roberts's stories serving as individual narrative strands that become more and more tightly plaited. Complicating this simple, at times overly mechanical back-and-forth design is a third player with a smaller strand, a corrupt New York detective, Trupo (Josh Brolin in a knockout performance), who shakes down Lucas and other larcenous types. The baddest bad man in town, a thug's thug, Trupo wears his power as confidently as the long black leather coat he whips on for battle. He hassles Lucas, who hates him in turn, and openly indulges his contempt for Roberts because the other cop is honest, which means he's a threat to Trupo and his kind.
 It's hard not to fall for these men pumping like pistons across the screen, which is as much part of the movie's allure as its problem. Mr. Scott doesn't escape the contradiction that bedevils almost every Hollywood movie about gangsters, which cry shame, shame, as they parade their stars, crank the soul and showcase the foxy ladies, the swank digs and rides. Mr. Washington obviously enjoys sinking into villainy, but he never finds the lower depths. There's little of the frightening menace the actor brought to ''Training Day,'' where you see the pleasure his character derives from his sadism. Even when Lucas goes ballistic, beating a man to pulp, the film tosses in a laugh about the proper way to clean a bloodied rug.
 Seriousness has always been one of Mr. Scott's strengths as a director, but when his material has skewed too light, too frivolous, the gravity and purpose etched into each one of his meticulous, beautiful images have also helped sink films. He couldn't make an ironic gesture if he wanted to, or toss off an idea or a shot. Everything counts, even if it shouldn't. (Such was the case with his and Mr. Crowe's last collaboration, their 2006 Provencal folly, ''A Good Year,'' a souffle made with lead.) Mr. Scott makes the case for his and his new film's seriousness in its opener, which shows Lucas tossing a match at a man who has been doused with gasoline and then pumping bullets into the burning, screaming figure. 
 This is the match that ignites the story of a criminal overlord who, without mercy or remorse, takes down one human being after another, many of whom, like the addicts he supplied, were as helpless as that burning man. By rights this match should also ignite a tragedy, and you can almost feel Mr. Scott trying to coax the material away from its generic trappings toward something rarefied, something like Francis Ford Coppola's 1972 definitive American story, ''The Godfather.'' He comes closest to that goal with the suggestion that the lethal pursuit of the American dream is not restricted to one or two families -- the Corleones, say, or the Sopranos -- but located in a network of warring tribes that help to obscure the larger war of all against all. 
 The America in this film isn't a melting or even a boiling pot; it's a bitter object lesson about the logic of market-driven radical individualism, wherein a self-styled Horatio Alger type, thwarted by racial prejudice and born into poverty in North Carolina, grows up to become a powerful captain of the illegal-drug industry. Lucas pulls himself up by his bootstraps, a gun tucked into his belt, and becomes a folk hero (and a pop culture idol) who doles out free turkeys to the very community he helps enslave with narcotics, fear and despair. He gathers his relatives around to help him, modeling himself after the Mafia families with whom he does business. He builds a gang, but only so it can serve his personal desires.
 The bottom line of what a Frank Lucas does -- to people, to neighborhoods -- doesn't make for entertainment. And so, despite Mr. Scott's talent for trouble and shadows (the cinematographer Harris Savides bleeds all the bright color from this world), he soon loosens his grip on Lucas. He lingers over the garish surfaces and violence, and the exotic locales where Lucas found a steady supply of pure heroin. He quotes ''Super Fly,'' fires up Bobby Womack, samples Richard M. Nixon and tosses in a pinch of black power rhetoric to mask the rot. He distracts and entertains until the divide between his seriousness of purpose and the false glamour that wafts around American gangsters, and invariably trivializes their brutality, becomes too wide to breach.
 Like many moviemakers (and watchers), Mr. Scott loves his bad guy too much. And by turning Lucas into a figure who seduces instead of repels, an object of directorial fetishism and a token of black resistance, however hollow, he encourages us to submit as well. Part of this is structural and economic: blood and nihilism are always better sells than misery and hopelessness. Yet there's also a historical dimension, because when Lucas strolls down a fast-emptying Harlem street after putting a bullet into another man's head and the camera pulls back for the long view, you are transported into the realm of myth. Once, another gunman, or the director, might have taken direct aim at Lucas. But the world belongs to gangsters now, not cowboys. 
 ''American Gangster'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Explicit and very realistic-looking intravenous drug use and bloody, bloody gun violence.

HEADLINE: Vast Effort to Save Everglades Falters as U.S. Funds Dwindle

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

DATELINE: MIAMI, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
The rescue of the Florida Everglades, the largest and most expensive environmental restoration project on the planet, is faltering. 
 Seven years into what was supposed to be a four-decade, $8 billion effort to reverse generations of destruction, federal financing has slowed to a trickle. Projects are already years behind schedule. Thousands of acres of wetlands and wildlife habitat continue to disappear, paved by developers or blasted by rock miners to feed the hungry construction industry. 
 The idea that the federal government could summon the will and money to restore the subtle, sodden grandeur of the so-called River of Grass is disappearing, too. 
 Supporters say the effort would get sorely needed momentum from a long-delayed federal bill authorizing $23 billion in water infrastructure projects, including almost $2 billion for the Everglades. 
 But President Bush is expected to veto the bill, possibly on Friday. And even if Congress overrides the veto, which is likely, grave uncertainties will remain. 
 The product of a striking bipartisan agreement just before the 2000 presidential election, the plan aims to restore the gentle, shallow flow of water from Lake Okeechobee, in south-central Florida, into the Everglades, a vast subtropical marshland at the state's southern tip. 
 That constant, slow coursing nurtured myriad species of birds, fish and other animals across the low-lying Everglades, half of which have been lost to agriculture and development over the last century.
 The plan calls for new reservoirs and other storage systems to capture excess water during South Florida's rainy seasons, guaranteeing an adequate water supply for cities and farms as well as the Everglades. That provision helped win the support of the powerful sugar industry, whose farms have long encroached on and polluted the Everglades, and of Jeb Bush, then the governor. 
 Mr. Bush is the younger brother of President Bush, and supporters of the restoration hoped his close ties with the White House would guarantee its early success. But while Jeb Bush invested heavily in the project, federal enthusiasm seemed to fade after its champions in Congress, including Senators Bob Graham and Connie Mack of Florida, left office and the Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina and other crises emerged.
 A changing economy, too, hurt the plan. It passed in a year with a record budget surplus, but the climate changed sharply after the terrorist attacks of 2001. Some state officials say the plan, which involves dozens of complex engineering projects, also got bogged down in federal bureaucracy, a victim of ''analysis paralysis.''
 Some environmentalists believe that having Jeb Bush in Tallahassee even hurt the restoration because the White House effectively handed it off to him. As a result, pressing state priorities -- enough drinking water and flood control to accommodate rapid population growth in South Florida -- took precedence over restoring a clean flow of water to Everglades National Park and the surrounding ecosystem.
 Nathaniel P. Reed, a conservationist who was an assistant interior secretary in the Nixon and Ford administrations, said that Karl Rove, President Bush's former political strategist, supported the restoration because he thought it was good politics -- ''the Bush brothers saving a dying ecosystem,'' Mr. Reed said. With Mr. Rove gone and the clock running down on the president's tenure, he said, the Everglades are more vulnerable than ever. 
 ''Everything now depends on 2008,'' Mr. Reed said. ''Everglades restoration depends on electing a president who can reignite the national consciousness that this great program should not fail.''
 So far, though, most presidential candidates have yet to utter the word ''Everglades.'' In the only mention that has made news, Fred D. Thompson, a Republican, suggested he might allow oil drilling there.
 While the Bush administration says it remains committed to the restoration, critics say its actions suggest otherwise. Although the cost of the effort was to be split evenly between Florida and Washington, the state so far has spent about $2 billion and the federal government only $358 million, though it has also helped finance some projects planned before the 2000 legislation. 
 Moreover, earlier this year, the Department of the Interior asked the United Nations to remove Everglades National Park from its list of endangered World Heritage sites. While largely symbolic, the removal sends the message that the Everglades no longer need help, said Senator Bill Nelson, Democrat of Florida.
 ''I have to deal in a world of perception and symbols,'' Mr. Nelson said, ''and when I'm begging each year for appropriations for Everglades restoration and suddenly the perception is, 'Well, the Everglades is making a lot of progress,' it's tying my hands behind my back in trying to get the federal share.''
 Florida, too, has done things to jeopardize the effort, said former Senator Graham, a Democrat who started the movement to save the Everglades in the 1980s. In 2003, the Legislature, under pressure from the sugar industry, postponed enforcement of strict pollution limits in the Everglades until 2016. 
 ''It's so important to avoid doing anything to send the signal that there's less than full commitment in the state where the Everglades is located,'' Mr. Graham said. ''Frankly, there are people in Washington looking for any sign of lack of commitment in Florida.''
 Florida has another perception problem, Mr. Graham said, in that it continues to permit development in environmentally sensitive areas -- sometimes even in the restoration footprint. Although the state has bought 55 percent of the land needed for the restoration, crucial land remains private.
 Meanwhile, the South Florida Water Management District revealed in September that farmers had missed a phosphorus reduction target for the first time in 11 years, despite the recent construction of 45,000 acres of filter marshes to reduce contaminants in agricultural runoff. 
 ''That is a very loud warning bell that some additional work is needed,'' said Charles S. Lee, advocacy director for Audubon of Florida. 
 State officials say that despite financing challenges, they have made significant progress acquiring land, building filter marshes south of Lake Okeechobee and restoring a more natural water flow to the Kissimmee River, south of Orlando, which is the headwater of the Everglades ecosystem. The state has also broken ground on a reservoir it calls the largest public works project in the world. 
 Supporters of the restoration have praised Gov. Charlie Crist's appointees to the water management district's board and to the state agency that regulates development. But Mr. Crist, a Republican who took office in January, is facing a budget crisis due to the real estate slump. ''Florida remains committed,'' Mr. Crist said in an interview. ''But we do have to face facts. We do have some economic challenges.''
 Like many others, Mr. Crist is pinning his hopes on the federal bill that provides $23 billion for water projects, including wetlands restoration in hurricane-ravaged Louisiana and beach replenishment around the country. The bill finances several projects that are crucial to restoring a clean flow of water through the Everglades. 
 It went to President Bush last week, and he has pledged to veto it because, he says, it is stuffed with political pork. Other critics agree, and say the bill does not ensure that the most crucial projects, including those in Florida and Louisiana, would get the highest priority.
 They also say the bill should have included major changes to the Army Corps of Engineers, which executes the projects but has been accused of misjudgments in engineering, design and the degree of potential harm to the environment.
 Corps officials have said the long delay in passing the water bill has hurt their ability to function well, but the critics say the problems are deeper than that. 
 ''This is just a recipe to keep the corps as dysfunctional as ever,'' said Michael Grunwald, a senior correspondent at Time magazine who wrote ''The Swamp: The Everglades, Florida, and the Politics of Paradise'' (Simon & Schuster, 2006), the most exhaustive recent book on the subject. 
 Echoing the criticism of many scientists, Mr. Grunwald also said the plan does not go far enough to restore a natural water flow to the Everglades and depends on dubious technology for storing billions of gallons of water.
 ''Until they fix the plan, until they fix the corps and until we get a handle on growth management in South Florida,'' he said, ''it's going to be hard to make a lot of progress in the Everglades.''
 So, too, will progress be difficult without support from lawmakers outside Florida. Rising land and construction costs have pushed the total estimated price to more than $10 billion. 
 Mr. Nelson took Senator Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat and chairwoman of the committee in charge of the water bill, on a tour of the Everglades in September. He has also been known to carry jars of polluted Everglades muck around the Capitol to draw the attention of his colleagues.
 Mr. Grunwald said focusing on Everglades National Park and the surrounding ecosystem, not providing water to farms and suburbs, is crucial to reviving national interest in the overall plan.
 ''It's the Everglades that's the national treasure,'' he said. ''That's why the guys from Iowa and Montana are going to support this thing.''

HEADLINE: Job Cuts at Chrysler Go Even Deeper Than Expected

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting from Detroit and Ian Austen from Ottawa.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 1 

 BODY:
Over the last two years, the three American auto companies have vowed that their plans to slash nearly 80,000 jobs and close more than two dozen plants would be enough to transform them into leaner and nimbler competitors.
 But the housing downturn and soaring oil prices have forced Chrysler and General Motors to make another round of surprising cuts, with no guarantees that these will be the last.
 On Thursday, Chrysler announced it would eliminate 11,000 hourly and salaried jobs in the United States and Canada, and cut shifts of workers at five plants. The decision comes on top of a plan, announced in February, to eliminate 13,000 jobs and close a factory in Newark, Del. 
 Taken together, Chrysler will be reducing its 2006 work force of about 80,000 employees by 30 percent.
 General Motors also recently said that it would eliminate shifts at three assembly plants in Michigan. The moves, announced after G.M. union workers approved their new contract, will most likely cut 3,000 jobs, though G.M. has not confirmed the total. Two years ago, G.M. announced 30,000 job cuts as part of a broad revamping.
 ''It does take one's breath away to realize that the auto industry in the U.S., having gone through so much turmoil and so many rounds of cuts, is going through them yet again,'' said Michael Useem, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
 The recent wave of cuts shows that the United Automobile Workers contract -- passed after brief strikes at G.M. and Chrysler, and now under negotiation at Ford -- has offered little protection against the sagging auto market, despite union leaders insisting they got the best deal they could for workers. 
 The experience at G.M. and Chrysler is bound to make Ford workers more insistent on job guarantees. They may be difficult for Ford to offer, unless the U.A.W. agrees to deeper cost cuts in other aspects of the contract. 
 Chrysler's new chief executive, Robert L. Nardelli, blamed sagging auto sales for the company's steps. Chrysler developed its earlier plan in a stronger car market, Mr. Nardelli said, while still under the wing of Daimler, its former German parent.
 Now, given the economic uncertainty, auto sales this year are expected to be the weakest since 1998. And Mr. Nardelli said the soft environment is expected to continue through next year.
 ''The market situation has changed dramatically,'' he said in a statement.
 Chrysler also said Thursday that it would retire four models, including the convertible version of the PT Cruiser and two models, the Dodge Magnum and Chrysler Crossfire, that were it developed during its failed merger with Daimler. Chrysler said the eliminations were based on suggestions from dealers.
 The cuts at the automaker were twice as deep as some had expected and came with little warning to the factories affected by them. 
 ''This is a huge shock for us,'' said Basil E. Hargrove, president of the Canadian Auto Workers union. 
 The Canadian union represents workers at plants in Windsor and Brampton, Ontario, where shifts will be cut. Other factories to lose shifts are in Belvidere, Ill., Toledo, Ohio, and two plants in Detroit. Chrysler said some of the work might be restored when it introduces new models. 
 The U.A.W. did not comment. But one dissident union leader, Gregg Shotwell, said Chrysler's actions threatened to create general distrust and divisiveness within the union.
 Union leaders ''certainly deserve to be distrusted because they misled people,'' said Mr. Shotwell, whose group, Soldiers of Solidarity, campaigned against the versions of the U.A.W. contract that passed at Chrysler and G.M. ''This has opened up people's eyes.''
 The cuts are an example of the new way of doing business at Chrysler, bought in August by Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm. Since then, the new owners have hired Mr. Nardelli, the former Home Depot chief executive, as well as James Press, a Toyota executive who is now a Chrysler's president. 
 Professor Useem said the steps showed Cerberus would not hesitate to take quick action that might take months or even years at other automakers. 
 ''Private equity is much better equipped to take the Draconian cuts'' than public companies such as G.M. and Ford, he added. ''It's in their DNA to be able to make these kinds of decisions. They don't owe anything to anybody.'' 
 Many industry analysts have said that Cerberus's turnaround efforts are intended to ready it for another global alliance or possibly a sale, although Mr. Nardelli has said he intends to run Chrysler as an independent player.
 Long term, however, Chrysler can only survive with low costs and respectable profits, a formula that its two Detroit rivals also are trying to carry out. 
 The cuts are putting the U.A.W.'s president, Ron Gettelfinger, in a difficult political position. After all, he backed Cerberus despite warning that private equity owners would ''strip and flip'' Chrysler.
 With the cuts announced Thursday, ''that's stripping,'' said Gary N. Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
 Yet, Chrysler's owners may not have much choice. On Thursday, the company said its sales in October fell 12.5 percent on an adjusted basis compared with 2006. For the year, Chrysler sales are down 3 percent, and it ranks as the country's fourth-biggest auto company, behind G.M., Toyota and Ford.
 Chrysler has long depended heavily on big pickups, sport utilities and minivans for the bulk of its sales, shifting its lineup only recently to build more small cars and small sport utilities, as well as crossover vehicles, which are S.U.V.'s based on car underpinnings.
 Thursday's announcement showed that even plants building some of its newest and more-efficient models were not immune from cuts. The Belvidere factory, for example, builds the small Dodge Caliber.
 Chrysler reiterated plans to build the Dodge Journey, a crossover, as well as the Dodge Challenger sports coupe, marking the return of the muscle car. It also said it would build hybrid-electric versions of two S.U.V.'s, the Dodge Aspen and Dodge Durango.

HEADLINE: Obama Envisions New Relationship With Iran

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and JEFF ZELENY

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 31 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama says he would ''engage in aggressive personal diplomacy'' with Iran if elected president and would offer economic inducements and a possible promise not to seek ''regime change'' if Iran stopped meddling in Iraq and cooperated on terrorism and nuclear issues. 
 In an hourlong interview on Wednesday, Mr. Obama made clear that forging a new relationship with Iran would be a major element of a broad effort to stabilize Iraq as he executed a speedy timetable for the withdrawal of American combat troops.
 Mr. Obama said that Iran had been ''acting irresponsibly'' by supporting Shiite militant groups in Iraq. He also emphasized that Iran's suspected nuclear weapons program and its support for ''terrorist activities'' were serious concerns. 
 But he asserted that Iran's support for militant groups in Iraq reflected its anxiety over the Bush administration's policies in the region, including talk of a possible American military strike on Iranian nuclear installations.
 Making clear that he planned to talk to Iran without preconditions, Mr. Obama emphasized further that ''changes in behavior'' by Iran could possibly be rewarded with membership in the World Trade Organization, other economic benefits and security guarantees. 
 ''We are willing to talk about certain assurances in the context of them showing some good faith,'' he said in the interview at his campaign headquarters here. ''I think it is important for us to send a signal that we are not hellbent on regime change, just for the sake of regime change, but expect changes in behavior. And there are both carrots and there are sticks available to them for those changes in behavior.'' 
 In his Democratic presidential bid, Mr. Obama has vigorously sought to distinguish himself on foreign policy from his rivals, particularly Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, by asserting that he would sit down for diplomatic meetings with countries like Iran, North Korea and Syria with no preconditions. 
 The suggestion, which emerged as a flash point in the campaign, has prompted Mrs. Clinton to question whether such an approach would amount to little more than a propaganda victory for the United States' adversaries and to question the experience of Mr. Obama, a first-term senator from Illinois. Other Democrats, in turn, have criticized Mrs. Clinton for an approach to Iran they call too hawkish, including a vote for a nonbinding resolution describing the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Iran as a terrorist organization.
 Mr. Obama's willingness to conduct talks at the highest level with Iran also differs significantly from the Bush administration's approach. 
 The administration has authorized Ambassador Ryan C. Crocker to discuss Iraq with Iranian officials. But the White House has also said it will not engage in high-level talks on other issues unless Iran first suspends its program to enrich uranium. Nor has the Bush administration advertised in detail the possible rewards for a change of Iranian behavior.
 Through most of the interview, Mr. Obama spoke without referring to notes. At one point near the end of the session, he leaned forward in his chair and looked at a yellow legal pad on the table in front of him, which listed points where he believed he and Mrs. Clinton differ on how to go forward in Iraq. 
 ''You don't want to look backwards, but obviously our general view about this mission as a whole has been very different,'' Mr. Obama said. ''She missed the strategic interests that should have dictated whether we went to Iraq in the first place or not.''
 Mrs. Clinton has said that after carrying out major troop withdrawals she would leave a residual force in Iraq to fight Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, battle other terrorist groups, train the Iraqi Army and deter Iranian intervention.
 Mr. Obama has also talked about keeping a limited force in Iraq after withdrawing American combat units at the rate of one or two per month. But he insisted in the interview that the mission of his residual force would be more limited than that posited by Mrs. Clinton. 
 Mr. Obama said, for example, that the part of the residual force assigned to counterterrorism might be based outside Iraq. He also emphasized that the residual force would not have the mission of deterring Iranian involvement in Iraq. 
 He said he would commit to training Iraqi security forces only if the Iraqi government engaged in political reconciliation and did not employ the Iraqi Army and the police for sectarian purposes. In any event, he said, American trainers would not be attached with Iraqi units that go in harm's way. 
 ''The trainers are going to have to be provided with missions that don't put them in vulnerable situations,'' he said. ''Part of what my goal is is that the trainers are not constantly embedded in combat operations.'' 
 Whether such a limited force could effectively influence events in Iraq is an important question. Keeping the part of the force assigned to counterterrorism outside the country raises the issue of whether it could respond in a timely way and without the benefit of the sort of intelligence that is gathered by forces that regularly interact with Iraqi civilians. Nor is it clear how, without keeping some combat forces in the country, the American military might rush to the aid of any trainers if they came under attack. 
 Mr. Obama acknowledged in the interview that there were ''legitimate questions'' as to how his concept of a residual force might work, and said he would adjust it if necessary after discussions with senior military leaders. 
 ''As commander in chief, I'm not going to leave trainers unprotected,'' he said. ''In our counterterrorism efforts, I'm not going to have a situation where our efforts can't be successful. If the commanders tell me that they need X, Y and Z, in order to accomplish the very narrow mission that I've laid out, then I will take that into consideration.''
 For all Mr. Obama's efforts to emphasize an approach that calls for minimal military involvement in Iraq, his plan is in one respect more ambitious than Mrs. Clinton's. While Mr. Obama said he hoped to withdraw all American combat forces within 16 months of taking office, his plan states that American and allied troops should be prepared to return to Iraq and protect civilians if there were genocidal attacks. 
 ''I do not anticipate that happening, because I think we can execute our withdrawal in an effective way,'' he said. ''What I am saying is that I as president am obviously going to be mindful of the possibility of humanitarian disaster, and if that were to occur, I am not ruling out that we wouldn't take steps in concert with other nations -- even if it was short term -- to ensure that a wholesale disaster did not take place.''
 Mr. Obama argued that it was ''too speculative'' to say if the United States would undertake such action unilaterally or only if allied nations chose to participate. 
 Other aspects of his policy for the Middle East also remain unclear. Mr. Obama declined to say if he would take military action if Iran did not abandon its presumed nuclear weapons program or if he would settle for a strategy of deterring and containing a nuclear-armed Iran.
 ''My decision making, with respect to military options versus diplomatic options, a containment strategy versus a strike strategy, is going to be informed by how is that going to impact not just Iran,'' he said, ''but how is that going to impact the stability of the region and how's that going to impact our long-term security interests.''
 Mr. Obama, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, visited Iraq in January 2006. Asked if that was his last visit, given how much events on the ground have changed since then, he jumped in before the question was finished, saying, ''Given how important this is, why haven't I gone back?''
 ''I'll be honest with you,'' he said. ''Part of it is that my schedule is such that the trips would be one or two days and would be centered around the Green Zone.''
 He added: ''I suspect we will be going back. It probably won't be before Iowa, realistically speaking.'' The Iowa caucuses are scheduled for Jan. 3.
 (Mrs. Clinton has been to Iraq three times, her aides said.) 
 Mr. Obama has implored voters to consider his judgment in foreign policy, reminding audiences at political rallies and in television commercials that he spoke out against the Iraq war from the beginning, two years before he was elected to the Senate. That judgment, he said, would be carried over to selecting people to fill his administration.
 He said his views were shaped by his foreign policy advisers, including Richard Danzig, who was Navy secretary under President Bill Clinton; Anthony Lake, a national security adviser in the Clinton administration; Susan E. Rice, an assistant secretary of state for African affairs under Mr. Clinton; Scott Gration, a retired Air Force major general; and Gen. Merrill A. McPeak, now retired, a former chief of staff of the Air Force.
 Asked whom he would appoint as defense secretary or to important national security positions, Mr. Obama said he would consider ''the best person, regardless of party.''

HEADLINE: Auto Sector's Role Dwindles, and Spending Suffers

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
THE automobile industry's share of the American economy has fallen to a historic low, the government reported this week, a few days before Chrysler announced another round of layoffs.
 During the third quarter, the government reported, spending by Americans on autos and auto parts fell to 3.1 percent of the total gross domestic product.
 As one chart accompanying this article shows, that is the lowest share of the economy in a quarter century, going back to a severe recession in the early 1980s. By that measure, the automobile industry appears to be suffering recession-level problems, even though the overall economy grew at a surprisingly strong 3.9 percent annual rate during the third quarter. 
 As recently as 2003, the auto industry was taking a 4 percent share of G.D.P., well above its average share, over the last 50 years, of 3.7 percent.
 A few tenths of a percentage point do not sound like much. But if the auto industry were taking its normal share this year, that would mean additional spending of about $80 billion.
 Some of that money is still going into transportation, as the price of gasoline has risen. Personal energy spending -- including gasoline, fuel oil and gas and electric utility bills -- now takes up 4.2 percent of the total economy, far above the 2.8 percent figure in 1999, when oil prices were low. But it is well below the 5.8 percent peak reached in 1982.
 The government's report showed some expected weak points. The data from housing and autos was bad, but some of that was made up by the strongest spending on construction of nonresidential buildings in 17 years.
 Within the public sector, state and local governments are spending at the fastest pace in three decades, and federal military spending is also up. But federal spending on everything but the military is at its lowest level, as a percentage of the economy, in six years. 
 The charts with this article look at the American economy since 1975 by examining the share of spending going to various sectors. Rising lines show that the sector is taking a bigger cut of the economic pie, while falling lines show the opposite.
 Each chart also shows the average share over the last 50 years, to provide a standard to measure current spending.
 Personal consumption spending, which leaped in the 1980s and 1990s, has now stabilized at around 70 percent of the total economy. Within that, however, there have been some big shifts. Medical care spending is now more than 12 percent of the economy, double the level in 1975.
 The share of national income going to residential construction is falling rapidly, but is still not very low. It peaked at 6.3 percent of the total economy in late 2005, and is now down to 4.5 percent. That is a rapid decline, but even now the level is only a bit below the long-term average.
 Nonresidential construction spending makes up a smaller part of the economy, but its strength has helped to offset some of the pain brought on by the housing plunge. Its 3.4 percent share of the economy is the highest since 1990.
 The real estate boom of recent years bolstered property tax revenues in many states, and spending followed. Spending by state and local governments is now 12.4 percent of the economy, the highest since 1976.
 Federal nonmilitary spending, however, has not grown nearly as rapidly as the economy. At 2.3 percent of the economy, it is lower than at any time since 2001.

HEADLINE: An Unlikely Megachurch Lesson

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
E-mail: sgfreedman@nytimes .com

 BODY:
One Sunday morning in 1995, Ron Wolfson and Rabbi Lawrence Hoffman braked to a halt in an oddly enlightening traffic jam. The line of cars was creeping toward Saddleback Church in Southern California, whose services were drawing thousands of worshipers. As two Jews, Mr. Wolfson and Rabbi Hoffman had crossed the sectarian divide to try to figure out how and why.
 As they inched down the road, they spotted a sign marked ''For First-Time Visitors.'' It directed them to pull into a separate lane and put on emergency blinkers. Bypassing the backup, they soon reached a lot with spaces reserved for newcomers. When Mr. Wolfson and Rabbi Hoffman emerged from their car, an official Saddleback greeter led them into the church. 
 Those first moments on the perimeter of the church set into motion a dozen years of increasing interaction between a Jewish organization devoted to reinvigorating synagogues and one of the most successful evangelical megachurches in the nation, the Rev. Rick Warren's Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, Calif. 
 This has not been a studiously balanced bit of ecumenicism. Synagogue 3000, the group led by Mr. Wolfson, an education professor, and Rabbi Hoffman, a scholar of liturgy, went to the church to figure out what evangelical Christians were doing right that Jews were doing wrong or not at all.
 ''To put it bluntly,'' Mr. Wolfson said, ''if there are thousands of people waiting to get in, I want to know what's going on. I want to know what they're doing that's tapping those souls.''
 The latest outgrowth of this unlikely learning curve is Hallelu Atlanta, a gathering tomorrow of 4,000 members of 18 congregations. With its amalgam of praise songs and spiritual testimonies, Mr. Wolfson describes the event as ''a Jewish tent meeting.'' A similar event outside Los Angeles in 2002 drew 5,000 participants.
 Since 1995, Synagogue 3000 and its precursor, Synagogue 2000, have taken member congregations and seminary classes to Saddleback and had Mr. Warren conduct a workshop in congregation-building for nearly 20 Jewish leaders. 
 Mr. Warren has delivered a d'var Torah -- a sermon on the weekly Torah portion -- at Sinai Temple, a prominent Conservative congregation in Los Angeles. His books ''The Purpose-Driven Church'' and ''The Purpose-Driven Life'' inspired similar volumes by Mr. Wolfson (''God's To-Do List'') and Rabbi Hoffman (''Rethinking Synagogues'').
 All this cross-pollination comes as a historical and theological anomaly. In the postwar decades, American Jews have built sturdy ecumenical bonds with Roman Catholics, mainline Protestants and African-American Christians on social issues like civil rights and economic injustice. In the aftermath of the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, many Jewish congregations sought out Muslim leaders or congregations for dialogues.
 Evangelical Christians, however, tended to excite the greatest wariness among Jews, with the exception of certain Orthodox groups that make common cause on issues like school vouchers. Not even the rise of Christian Zionism has overcome Jewish anxiety about a brand of Christianity whose defining word, ''evangelism,'' connotes a determined effort at conversion.
 ''Some Jews, especially in areas where they are a minority, fear that Christianity is contagious,'' said Mark I. Pinsky, an author based in Florida whose books include ''A Jew Among the Evangelicals.'' ''On another level, there is a palpable resistance call it arrogance to the notion that these relative 'newcomers' to religion have anything to teach us. And finally, there is the class issue, that evangelicals aren't as deep as we are, that they are in their sanctuaries for entertainment, rather than for spirituality.''
 What got Mr. Wolfson and Rabbi Hoffman over those impediments was what is known in Jewish parlance as a ''shidduch,'' Hebrew for ''a match.'' From the early years of Saddleback, which Mr. Warren founded in 1980, the pastor had relied on an observant Jew, Mel Malkoff, for expertise in land acquisition and property development. 
 Mr. Malkoff in turn told his rabbi, Elie Spitz, of Saddleback's propulsive growth since Mr. Warren started the congregation with seven people in his home. (It now has 82,000 members and routinely has 25,000 people attend its multiple Sunday services.) Mr. Spitz then told Mr. Wolfson, and before long he was stuck in traffic.
 For all its utility and good will, the relationship between Mr. Wolfson's group and Mr. Warren's church has required some delicate diplomacy. Saddleback may be politically centrist on the evangelical Christian spectrum -- Mr. Warren has taken on AIDS and global warming as key causes -- but on issues including abortion and gay rights it stands in polar opposition to the socially liberal mainstream of American Jewry.
 When Mr. Warren conducted his workshop for Synagogue 3000's leaders in 2005, several participants challenged his view of homosexuality as abnormal and unbiblical. ''Every faith has its own parameters,'' Mr. Warren responded, calmly and firmly, in an exchange preserved on a DVD of the session. ''You can't believe it all.''
 On the topic of conversion, Mr. Warren told his Jewish listeners, he ''doesn't believe in coercion'' though he ''does believe in persuasion.'' That seemed to placate, if not necessarily please, the group. 
 The Jewish leaders were visibly captivated, however, when Mr. Warren recounted building the church -- going door-to-door seeking people who belonged to no congregation, asking them why they didn't belong, devising an initial program to directly meet their desires.
 Those desires resonated immediately for Jewish leaders frustrated in the failure of synagogues to engage the unaffiliated, the disaffected, the spiritual seekers. Mr. Warren's informants had told him they yearned for a friendly welcome, quality child care, a sermon that had a pragmatic message for their weekday lives and an overarching sense that the church cared more about each member as a person than as a revenue stream.
 Mr. Warren told the workshop listeners what he had come to realize: ''A congregation isn't a building. God dwells in people.'' He explained that Saddleback did not construct its own building until it had 10,000 congregants. Even in the church's current vastness, a decentralized network of ministers and laity seek to connect every newcomer to at least six longtime members.
 ''The biggest challenge we have in transforming synagogue life,'' Mr. Wolfson said recently, recalling the workshop, ''is transforming the basic relationship of most Jews to most synagogues.'' He added: ''It's a fee-for-service model. I'm going to write you a check, and you're going to give me what I need -- a rabbi on call, High Holy Days seats, a Hebrew school for my kids. It's not deep.''
 Mr. Hoffman said the most obvious exception in the Jewish world was the Chabad movement of the Lubavitcher Hasidim. Its success at what is called ''inreach,'' meaning proselytizing unobservant Jews, has become a source of fascination, envy and enmity. In a strange way, it may have been less controversial for Synagogue 3000 to emulate Christians who are total outsiders rather than a Hasidic sect that competes for the same pool of Jewish souls.
 ''Jews need to be more quote-unquote evangelical,'' Mr. Wolfson said. ''We need to do a better job of presenting Judaism to our own people. The story doesn't get across that Judaism is a way to find meaning and purpose in your life. And that's another lesson I've learned from the evangelical model.''

HEADLINE: Let Us Pray for Wealth

BYLINE: By DAN MITCHELL

 BODY:
A GLOBAL survey recently conducted by the Pew Research Center shows that the wealthier you are, the less likely you are to be religious.
 The survey, done as part of the Pew Global Attitudes Project, covers a wide swath of economic matters, including global trade and immigration (pewglobal.org). 
 Pew found that there is ''a strong relationship between a country's religiosity and its economic status.'' The poorer a country, the more ''religion remains central to the lives of individuals, while secular perspectives are more common in richer nations.'' 
 The United States is the ''most notable'' exception. Other exceptions are oil-rich, mostly Muslim nations like Kuwait.
 There is no simple interpretation of the findings. Perhaps as ''people get less religious, they get wealthier,'' wrote Kevin Drum of the Washington Monthly's Political Animal blog (washingtonmonthly.com). ''Or perhaps the other way around. Or perhaps there's something else behind both trends.''
 Mr. Drum concludes that it's ''probably a bit of all three.''
 CHARTING THE BUST Home prices in the United States fell by 4.4 percent in the year ending in August, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller Home Price Indices, released this week. ''But it's in the metropolitan area details that the Case-Shiller data gets really interesting,'' according to Justin Fox, who writes the Time.com blog The Curious Capitalist.
 Mr. Fox charted the data, which, he wrote, showed ''how the different metro areas segregate themselves into pretty clearly delineated categories.''
 The cities where prices had risen particularly high include, among others, Los Angeles, Washington, Miami, San Francisco and New York. Both San Francisco and New York ''saw steadier (and possibly less bubblicious) gains than the rest,'' he wrote.
 Seattle and Portland ''are still living in their own happy, Northwestern alternative reality in which the real estate bust is just something you read about in your favorite newsweekly.''
 Then there are three cities where prices rose quickly but not nearly as high -- Boston, Chicago and Minneapolis.
 Finally, there are the areas, mostly in the South and Midwest, that did not experience the spikes in real estate prices that other areas did. ''Most are doing O.K.,'' Mr. Fox wrote, ''but Detroit and Cleveland -- for reasons that have more to do with problems in the manufacturing sector than with problems in the real estate business -- are not.''
 NOT-SO-SMALL WORLDDisneyland's water ride It's a Small World will be refurbished next year, in part to replace the boats and the winding flume they travel down. 
 The boats often get stuck, and the reason ''isn't very flattering to the modern American psyche,'' writes Al Lutz of the Disney-watching Web site MiceAge. The ride was designed in 1963 for much slimmer people. As Americans have gotten fatter, he wrote, the backups have increased (miceage.com). 
 A Disney spokesman said Mr. Lutz has it wrong. Repairs have caused a buildup of fiberglass in the flume, decreasing the clearance. The repairs, which will close the ride for 10 months starting in January, ''have nothing to do with weight,'' he said.
 But doesn't logic dictate that heavier loads would worsen the problem? As several blogs, including MiceAge, The Consumerist (consumerist.com), and CalorieLab.com have apparently done, ''you can draw your own conclusions,'' the spokesman said.

HEADLINE: Despite Gain In Jobs Data, Wall Street Is Skeptical

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; David Leonhardt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A robust employment report offered investors a pleasant surprise yesterday, but some thought it was too good to be true.
 The economy added 166,000 jobs in October, the fastest pace in five months, the Labor Department said. But anxious investors cast doubt on the report and sent stock markets down much of the day as the outlook for fourth quarter remained cloudy.
 Analysts said the job gain in October meant that the Federal Reserve would be less likely to cut interest rates again when it meets in December despite fears of rising energy prices, weaker spending and a worsening housing slump. 
 ''Sooner or later these big problems out there -- credit, housing, and oil -- are going to catch up with us,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at Global Insight. ''We can't keep running forever on this two-track economy, where housing collapses and everything else just carries on like nothing else is happening.''
 The monthly jobs report is considered a bellwether of the nation's economic health. But Wall Street was uneasy, with stocks fluctuating throughout yesterday's session before closing slightly higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed up 0.1 percent, or 1.21 points, at 1,509.65. The Dow Jones industrials gained 0.2 percent, closing at 13,595.10, up 27.23 points. The Nasdaq composite gained 15.55 points, or 0.6 percent, to 2,810.38. 
 Big banks and brokerage houses dragged most of the day, pulled down by Merrill Lynch, whose stock plunged nearly 8 percent after analysts questioned its relationship with several hedge funds. Investors fear the bank will be forced to write down the value of assets beyond the $8.4 billion it wrote down in the third quarter, adding to concerns about a tightening credit market. 
 Chevron, the oil company, reported a 24 percent drop in third-quarter earnings, citing weaker refining margins. The disappointing performance followed a similarly weak report on Thursday from Exxon Mobil, whose profit declined 10 percent last quarter. 
 Better-than-expected job growth would normally cheer the markets. Nonfarm payrolls in October grew more than twice what analysts had predicted, led by a sharp increase in the service sector.
 But many analysts said they were skeptical of the gains, underscoring the uncertainty on Wall Street. 
 Some economists saw distortions in the data. With seasonal adjustment factors removed, nearly half of the gain in private jobs came from an estimate that the Labor Department makes each month about how many jobs were added by new businesses, known as the ''birth and death'' model. The Labor Department did not actually find evidence of these jobs; it assumed they were created based on historical patterns.
 A separate survey of households, also conducted by the Labor Department, presented a very different picture of the job market. It showed that fewer Americans over all were employed in October. The labor force shrank by 211,000 jobs, and 465,000 Americans said they were no longer working or seeking work. 
 Those are considered highly volatile figures, and retirees, for example, are included among the group that is considered to have left the labor force. But some economists said they were concerned by the drops.
 ''The slowdown in household may, on this occasion, be telling you the true story,'' said Ian C. Shepherdson, the chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm in Valhalla, N.Y. He said the 166,000 rise in payrolls ''is incredibly narrow and sort of implausible.''
 Some analysts said the expansion in October offered a signal that the economy was more resilient than previously thought, but they were quick to add a more cynical caveat. 
 ''The financial turmoil and pessimism hitting Wall Street is not affecting business hiring on Main Street,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Bank of America. Still, he acknowledged a ''tremendous amount of uncertainty'' as analysts fear a broad slowdown in business activity over the coming months.
 The estimate of overall job growth, which beat even the highest estimates, followed a 96,000 gain in September, which was revised down from the previous estimate of 110,000. Payrolls are increasing at the slowest annual rate since June 2004.
 Manufacturers lost 21,000 jobs last month, their 16th consecutive decline. Retail businesses cut 21,500 employees from their payrolls. The declines underscored analysts' expectations that consumer spending will slow, further hurting businesses.
 The unemployment rate held steady at 4.7 percent in October, the highest rate since August 2006, but only because the survey found that more people stopped looking for work and were therefore not counted by the government as unemployed.
 Wages ticked up 0.2 percent, to $17.58, slightly below expectations, and were up 3.8 percent compared with those a year earlier. The length of the average workweek stayed flat at 33.8 hours. 
 President Bush, speaking in Columbia, S.C., said the report offered support for his administration's economic platform. ''This is now our 50th consecutive month of uninterrupted job growth, the longest in the nation's history,'' he said.

HEADLINE: An Italian Author Driven Into the Shadows by Success

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER

DATELINE: ROME 

 BODY:
 ROBERTO SAVIANO jokes that he has a mobster's face, which, if true, has done nothing to endear him to the real criminals he writes about. They despise him, so much so that Mr. Saviano, 28, has been forced to live in hiding under state protection, a sort of Salman Rushdie in Italy's still unresolved struggle against organized crime. 
 The distaste is mutual. 
 ''I have always hated them, a personal hatred, not just an intellectual one,'' Mr. Saviano said in the safety of his publisher's office here, with his three well-armed police bodyguards waiting outside on the street. ''It is a very personal hatred because they ruined my country, forced people to emigrate, killed honest people.'' By his count, 3,600 have been killed in the area where he grew up, outside Naples, since he was born in 1979. 
 ''I know where to hit them to make them angry,'' he added. 
 Mr. Saviano became famous in Italy after the 2006 release of his first book, an up-close account of the inner workings of the Camorra, the crime group that has operated around Naples for more than a century. The title was provocative: ''Gomorrah,'' a biblical wordplay invoking sin and degeneracy. The subject was notable: little has been written about the Camorra, whereas books and films about the Sicilian Mafia have flourished for many decades. 
 But ''Gomorrah'' (Arnoldo Mondadori Editore) went beyond expectations. It sold 750,000 copies here and was just released in the United States, partly because of the way Mr. Saviano wrote it: it is a literary scream that names names, of the killers and the killed, in a style inspired by the filmmaker Pier Paolo Pasolini's broad unflinching criticism of Italy and by Truman Capote's devotion to dirty detail. 
 ''When you die on the street, you're surrounded by a tremendous racket,'' he writes, describing one of scores of slayings he bumped into as a teenager in the town of Casal di Principe, then went out seeking as an adult researching his book. ''It's not true that you die alone. Unfamiliar faces right in front of your nose, people touching your legs and arms to see if you're already dead or if it's worth calling an ambulance.
 ''All the faces of the seriously wounded, all the expressions of the dying, seem to share the same fear. And the same shame. It may seem strange, but in the instant before death there is a sort of shame or humiliation.''
 Shame has been no small part of the complicated reaction here to Mr. Saviano and his book, despite its ongoing success. It has sold well in translation around Europe, notably in France and Germany. A movie in Italian is being filmed, and a stage version has opened in Naples, though Mr. Saviano did not attend the opening for security reasons. But with the strong desire in Italy to shed its identification with organized crime, the book cut too close to truth to make him a popular man here. 
 ''No one will forgive me for what I did,'' he said in the interview. ''I gave attention to a world that creates problems for the honest part of my country. And also some of the honest ones in my country hate me because I spoke of crime. It is as though I had reduced Italy only to the part of it that is criminal. I don't think I did that.''
 RECENT news seems to support Mr. Saviano's view of the pervasiveness of the mob: In late October, Italy's small-business group reported that mob activity accounted for the single largest sector of the nation's economy. In August, six Italians linked to the 'Ndrangheta, an elusive crime group from Italy's far south, were killed in Germany -- a possibly foreboding expansion of what the group considers its turf. 
 Mr. Saviano believes that the Camorra -- though views differ, he counts it as more powerful than the Mafia or 'Ndrangheta -- remains as centrally integrated into life here as ever, a dark and never-purged mirror image of Italy. 
 Alexander Stille, a professor of journalism at Columbia who wrote one of the most respected books on Italy's struggle with the Sicilian Mafia, ''Excellent Cadavers,'' called the book ''very important'' for shedding light on an organization that has unjustly ''taken second or third billing'' compared with the Mafia. 
 ''What the book does so well is to remind people, as if it needed reminding, that a third of the country is essentially condemned to a state of permanent underdevelopment because of the persistent, and in many ways increasing, dominance, of organized crime,'' he said.
 The Camorra is not as well known as the Sicilian Mafia, but much of the lore and romance of mob life was born around Naples. Don Corleone of ''The Godfather'' was modeled on a Camorra boss, though he was portrayed as Sicilian in the book. The real Lucky Luciano dropped dead of a heart attack in the Naples airport. John Gotti's family was not from Sicily but from a town near Naples, as was Tony Soprano's. 
 In his book, researched in part by his taking small odd jobs connected to the mob, Mr. Saviano documents the Camorra's recent history, detailing more than just the expected, like its reach in drugs, extortion, high fashion, shipping (increasingly with Chinese gangs) and politics. 
 He shows other connections, like how Tuscany stays eco-lovely and full of tourists by shipping its trash south illegally, or how money is rarely the first thing on a young mobster's mind. One chapter is called ''Women,'' another ''Hollywood,'' about how mobsters imitate movies as much as movies imitate them.
 ''People of my age who decide to enter the clan do it less at first for money or power than for fashion, for women, to be a real man,'' he said. ''Because they teach you at an early age how to live with death.''
 MR. SAVIANO is very much a child of southern Italy, poorer and less developed than the north, drained over nearly a century of people who gave up on Italy to find life elsewhere. His joke about having a mobster's face, with his shadowy eyes and stubble, is not far off the mark. He wears the three rings traditional to the area -- for the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. 
 The son of a doctor, Mr. Saviano says he, too, learned the mobster's talent for living with death, growing up in Casal di Principe, home of one of the top Camorra bosses, where he stumbled across his first body in his early teenage years on the way to school. That has served him well over the last year, after the threats started coming. The Camorra, suddenly the topic of a best-selling book, was apparently not happy. 
 ''I can't feel afraid, but this could be one of my limitations,'' Mr. Saviano said. ''It's as if the continuous telling of things, observing things, has perhaps blocked my fear.'' 
 Amid other threats as the book gained popularity -- and after an appearance in his hometown in which Mr. Saviano publicly challenged Camorra bosses by name, earning both praise for bravery and criticism for being either self-promoting or suicidal -- some camorristi were wiretapped discussing Mr. Saviano's ''destiny.'' 
 ''What's required is a public intervention by the state,'' Umberto Eco, perhaps Italy's most prominent author, wrote at the time. ''Let's not leave Saviano alone.''
 Now Mr. Saviano is never far from his three guards. As he ponders a second book, possibly on crime in Mexico, he knows he will not have the same freedom to report as he did for ''Gomorrah.'' He has no regular home. With Italian crime globalized to a degree that its legitimate businesses are not, when he leaves Italy his bodyguards go, too. 
 ''I have become a type of symbol for them,'' he said. ''I am responsible for all the attention on them.''
 But now, he said, ''If they strike, they will have to spill a lot of blood.''
 On the bright side, ''Gomorrah'' is reportedly the most requested book in Italian jails.

HEADLINE: The Dings and Dents of Toyota

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting from Detroit.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
It might seem odd to suggest that a 70-year-old company is going through growing pains, especially one with $183 billion in annual sales.
 But 2007 has been a difficult year for Toyota.
 Its reputation for building high-quality vehicles has been tarnished, most recently by the decision by Consumer Reports to stop automatically giving a ''recommended'' label to all its cars and trucks. 
 Toyota's sales growth, which has been in the double-digit range in recent years, has slowed more in the United States than the company expected, causing it to lose its grip on the biggest-automaker title it took from General Motors last spring.
 And it has seen some of its most talented American executives return to Detroit, notably James Press, who left the company's highest-ranking job in North America to join Chrysler. 
 That run of bad news may provide some breathing room for competitors from whom Toyota has been steadily stealing market share.
 Yet Toyota has a long track record of learning from such challenges and mistakes. And with Detroit companies still curtailing their operations, including the 11,000 job cuts that Chrysler announced Thursday, Toyota has some breathing room to fix itself.
 Indeed, some longtime industry observers say that the negative news about Toyota is unlikely to affect its prospects drastically.
 ''Toyota's short-term problems are exaggerated,'' said James P. Womack, a manufacturing expert and co-author of ''The Machine That Changed the World,'' the 1990 book that examined Japanese plants in the United States.
 But Mr. Womack said he was concerned that Toyota might be losing its laserlike focus, just as it marked two important anniversaries this year: its 70th birthday as an automobile company, and its 50th year selling cars in the United States.
 ''Toyota has to rethink its purpose in life,'' Mr. Womack said. The company remains on track to achieve its 2010 goal of owning 15 percent of the global car market (its market share in the United States was 16.2 percent through October). But biggest is not necessarily the same as being the world's best car company, which was long Toyota's main objective, he said. A focus on volume, for example, can easily lead to missteps with product introductions or slips in quality.
 ''The dog has caught the car,'' he said. ''But what was the point?''
 Passing G.M. in the spring as the biggest automaker seemed a major accomplishment for Toyota at the time. It appeared to have shaken off quality problems that dogged it in 2006, when it reported double the number of recalls it had 2005. 
 Through October, its recalls in the United States and Japan have fallen by about half from 2006, when it recalled 2.1 million vehicles. But Toyota shares fell last month when it recalled about 470,000 vehicles in Japan, its fifth recall there this year. None of those vehicles was shipped to the United States, however.
 Last year's run of quality glitches prompted Toyota's chief executive, Katsuaki Watanabe, to appoint an executive in charge of quality and to dispatch engineers throughout the company to work on improving its cars.
 Inside Toyota, ''everyone, and I mean everyone,'' is focused on improving quality, said Jeffrey Liker, professor of engineering at the University of Michigan and author of ''The Toyota Way,'' a study of the company's management philosophy. ''Quality is how they have built their competitive advantage.''
 But the effort could not head off the decision by Consumer Reports magazine last month to no longer automatically give new or restyled Toyota vehicles a recommended rating. That leaves only Subaru and Honda with those bragging rights. 
 In particular, Consumer Reports cited problems on three models, including versions of the Camry sedan, the Tundra pickup and the Lexus GS luxury car 
 Consumer Reports will require a year's worth of reliability data, as it does for other carmakers, before deciding whether it can recommend a Toyota car. 
 Despite Toyota's track record, Consumer Reports did not hesitate to pull the automatic ranking, said David Champion, the magazine's senior director of automotive testing. ''It takes a long time to earn that reputation, but it doesn't take long to lose it,'' Mr. Champion said.
 ''We have no issue with that,'' said Mike Michels, a Toyota spokesman, of the magazine's decision. ''We don't think anybody is entitled to an automatic recommendation.''
 But the step was a clear setback for Toyota, which built its brand with help from the magazine's high ratings for its small cars. 
 ''It matters,'' said James Lentz, executive vice president at Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A.. its American marketing arm.
 The timing of the Consumer Reports announcement was hardly ideal -- it coincided with the dinner at which Toyota's honorary chairman, Shoichiro Toyoda, was inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in Dearborn, Mich.
 Mr. Champion, of Consumer Reports, said Toyota will likely regain its footing, although it will take several years of average to above-average quality ratings to regain the magazine's automatic recommendation. 
 ''They should put it right relatively quickly,'' he said. ''They're still an extremely reliable company.''
 Toyota's reliability is being tested in other areas as well. For the last 10 years, Toyota's market share has been on a steady march upward in the United States, more than doubling from 7 percent in 1997. It has passed both Chrysler and Ford Motor in the last 12 months to rank as the country's second-biggest auto company, behind G.M.
 Mr. Press warned at the start of the year that Toyota's growth would slow to about 5 percent this year. He cited uncertain economic conditions and few new vehicles.
 Even Mr. Press was too optimistic: Through October, Toyota's sales were up just 3.5 percent. While none of the Detroit companies' sales have risen this year, Toyota has experienced a few months in which its sales dropped from the year before.
 Mr. Press, meanwhile, is no longer at the North American helm. His departure for Chrysler, where he is co-president, startled the company. It got another jolt when James D. Farley, who ran its Lexus division, jumped to Ford to become its group vice president of marketing. Another Lexus executive, Deborah Wahl Meyer, preceded Mr. Press' arrival at Chrysler.
 Along with holding the top job in North America, Mr. Press had become the first American to join the Toyota board. But the company's uppermost ranks remain solidly Japanese, even though its collective sales in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere are bigger than those in Japan.
 Toyota officials expressed disappointment at the loss of Mr. Press and the other executives, but stressed the company has plenty of talent, both in the United States and in Japan.
 Mr. Womack, however, said he fears that the company has not produced ''the number of quality managers they need to support their growth rate,'' Mr. Womack said. ''This is the big, big problem.''
 Still, Chrysler's hiring of Mr. Press ''could be a gift,'' he said, if it makes Toyota aware of the problem it has in retaining top talent.
 History suggests Toyota does learn from its problems. After all, Toyota's rise in the United States market began after one of its biggest mishaps: the Crown Toyopet.
 Introduced in 1957, the small Toyopet was essentially laughed out of American showrooms, forcing the company to virtually shut down its sales operation the following year before coming back in 1959. 
 It took Toyota another 10 years before it was selling 100,000 cars a year in the United States. This year, it is on track to top 2.5 million.

HEADLINE: Baseball's Losing Formula

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEWIS. 
Michael Lewis is an assistant professor of marketing at the Olin Business School at Washington University.

DATELINE: St. Louis 

 BODY:
 THE end of the World Series marks the start of baseball's business season, when players and managers move from team to team and receipts are tallied to determine how much the richer teams will pay toward, and the poorer teams will receive from, revenue sharing. Redistributing the wealth, it is assumed, ensures that all teams have a chance at success.
 The Colorado Rockies' appearance in the World Series last month may have looked like evidence of success for revenue-sharing. Like the Oakland Athletics, the Minnesota Twins, the Detroit Tigers and the San Diego Padres last year, a small-market team proved competitive enough to reach the playoffs. But revenue sharing, as it is now structured, actually makes lasting success less likely for all five of these teams. 
 It's true that the Colorado team benefits from revenue sharing. In 2006, the team received about $15 million from the pool, while the Boston Red Sox, the team that beat them in the Series, contributed more than $50 million to it. But the Rockies' $54 million payroll this year was still only about 65 percent of the major league average of $82 million -- and almost $90 million less than that of the Red Sox. Over the past two decades, teams with such relatively small payrolls have won their divisions less than 10 percent of the time.
 Even this year, the Rockies' success was inconsistent; the team was nine games under .500 during May, and by mid-September only four games above .500. 
 Given this mediocrity it's not surprising that all season, more than 40 percent of the seats at Coors Field were empty. Despite the surge that carried the team into October, there is good reason to expect it to follow in the footsteps of the Athletics, Twins, Tigers and Padres and sit out the next postseason.
 Since 1998, millions of dollars have been transferred from richer teams to poorer ones in an attempt to let all teams share in the economic advantages associated with playing in big markets -- a large fan base, lots of press coverage and lucrative local cable television contracts. Last year, more than $300 million was transferred. 
 Yet since revenue sharing began, at least one team from each of the big four markets -- New York, Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston -- has appeared in every World Series except 2006. In the 10 years before 1998, in contrast, only two Series included one of those big-market teams. 
 The problem is that the teams receiving payments have come to use them as a primary source of income -- rather than to build winning teams. The most extreme example has been the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. In 2006, this team had a payroll of about $35 million, $42 million less than the 2006 league average. Not surprisingly, it won only 38 percent of its games and filled less than 40 percent of its seats for home games. It also collected more than $30 million in revenue-sharing transfers. This past season, the team reduced its payroll to $24 million and had about the same level of success. 
 The Pittsburgh Pirates and the Kansas City Royals have also received significant revenue-sharing payments but kept payrolls low. These teams may well be slowly destroying their customer base. (The Rockies were not so parsimonious. With the team receiving $16 million in 2006, it increased its payroll for the next season by around $15 million.)
 The problem is that transfers are based on local revenues. Teams that receive money are encouraged to invest it in their payrolls. But if a team actually attracts fans by fielding a winning team, its revenue-sharing receipts will be reduced. 
 To create a more balanced playing field, revenue-sharing payments should be increased for teams that attract more fans. I have devised an approach for doing this based on a statistical analyses of teams' payrolls, winning percentages and attendance. It takes into account the size of the team's local population, to acknowledge that teams in places like New York and Chicago have greater financial incentives to invest in players than teams in places like Milwaukee and Kansas City do.
 Here's how my formula would have affected the revenue-sharing payments to the Pittsburgh Pirates, which last year filled only 60 percent of its seats but received $25 million in revenue sharing. If the team could have increased its attendance rate to 70 percent, its payments would have grown to $29 million, and if attendance had gone up to 80 percent, the payments would have reached $33 million. My formula would have had even more significant consequences for the Devil Rays. Based on the team's 38-percent attendance rate, its revenue-sharing payments would have been reduced from $33 million to $13.5 million. 
 There are a variety of ways to drum up fan interest, from free hat days at the park to postgame fireworks, but the best way is to field a competitive team. Linking revenue sharing to attendance would encourage teams to spend more on players. By winning more games, they would benefit from both higher gate receipts and increased revenue-sharing payments. Not to mention the lasting loyalty of their fans.

HEADLINE: Crude Oil Futures Trade Above $96 Again

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The prospect of a stronger economy and word of possible new United Nations sanctions against Iran sent crude oil futures back above $96 a barrel yesterday, while retail gasoline prices extended their own march higher. 
 Gold also rose sharply, gaining $14.80, or almost 2 percent, to close above $800 an ounce for the first time since 1980. 
 Gold futures settled at $808.50 an ounce on the commodity exchange division of the New York Mercantile Exchange; the metal is up 27 percent for the year as investors look for safe haven from the weakened dollar. 
 Oil futures added to their gains late yesterday when the British Foreign Office said the United Nations Security Council had agreed to draft a new sanctions resolution that could be passed in November if Iranian cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency did not improve. Investors worry that any conflict between the West and Iran would disrupt oil supplies from the Middle East.
 Light crude for December delivery rose $2.44 to settle at a record $95.93 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange after rising as high as $96.05 earlier, short of a trading record of $96.24 set Thursday. 
 On Thursday, oil prices retreated from that early record to settle down more than $1, in part because of dismal reports on consumer spending and industrial activity that also factored into the Dow Jones industrial average's 362-point decline.
 Crude prices are within the range of inflation-adjusted highs set in early 1980. Depending on the how the adjustment is calculated, $38 a barrel then would be worth $96 to $103 or more today.
 At the pump, meanwhile, gas prices jumped 2.9 cents overnight to a national average of $2.942 a gallon, according to AAA, the automobile club, and the Oil Price Information Service. Gas prices have risen nearly 19 cents since mid-October.
 Analysts say gas prices are rising to catch up with oil prices, which have jumped 39 percent since late August. But low demand for gasoline will keep prices from rising above $3 again this year, many analysts say. Gas prices peaked for the year at $3.227 a gallon in late May.
 December gasoline rose 9.63 cents to settle at $2.4395 a gallon on the Nymex, and December heating oil rose 6.14 cents, to settle at $2.5737 a gallon.
 Also supporting prices yesterday, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told Turkish officials the United States viewed Kurdish rebels based in northern Iraq as a ''common threat'' that the United States would help fight. Investors have sent oil prices sharply higher in recent weeks in part on concerns that a Turkish incursion into Iraq in search of Kurdish rebels would cut oil supplies from Northern Iraq.
 Additionally, investors already concerned about falling oil supplies and imports received word that Hurricane Noel might have disrupted some oil shipments this week. And analysts said OPEC production increases that began Thursday had been hampered by maintenance at some Middle Eastern oil fields.
 The confluence of headlines fueled fears that there will be fourth-quarter shortages of oil and other petroleum products as cold weather comes to the Northeast.

HEADLINE: Lipitor Maker Digs In to Fight Generic Rival

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE SAUL and ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
It is shaping up to be the biggest shift yet to a generic drug, potentially saving the nation $2 billion a year or more in prescription costs. 
 And scientists and doctors say that for most of the 16 million people in America who take drugs to reduce cholesterol, the low-priced alternative will work as well as the name-brand medicine -- Lipitor, which is made by Pfizer and is the nation's most widely prescribed drug. 
 While Lipitor itself is not available as a generic, a very similar drug made by Merck, Zocor, lost its patent protection last year. The generic version of Zocor, simvastatin, is now much cheaper than Lipitor, leading insurers to press doctors and patients to switch.
 But Pfizer is not letting its flagship drug go down without a fight. 
 The company has mounted a campaign that includes advertisements, lobbying efforts and a paid speaking tour by a former secretary of the federal Department of Health and Human Services. Pfizer is also promoting a study -- whose findings many experts are questioning -- that concluded that British patients who switched to simvastatin had more heart attacks and deaths than those who remained on Lipitor. 
 The Lipitor battle has become a test of the pharmaceutical industry's ability to defend name brands, even as insurers, patients and doctors seek to whittle the nation's $270 billion annual prescription drug bill by using generic alternatives whenever possible. 
 Lipitor and other cholesterol-lowering drugs, sometimes called statins, are the largest drug class, with spending of $22 billion last year in the United States alone. And they have been researched more thoroughly than any other group of drugs, making head-to-head comparisons easier.
 Many doctors have come to see simvastatin as a viable substitute for Lipitor. Studies show that at commonly prescribed doses Lipitor and simvastatin are equally effective at reducing LDL cholesterol, the so-called bad cholesterol.
 A big difference is that Lipitor costs $2.50 to $3 a day, while simvastatin sells for 75 cents to $1 a day at most retail pharmacies, and as little as 10 cents a day at discount pharmacies like Costco's. 
 Each month, doctors with patients on Lipitor are switching tens of thousands of them to simvastatin. And simvastatin is also taking a growing share of the market for new patients who need a cholesterol drug. ''Simvastatin is much less expensive to society over all and to patients,'' said Dr. Thomas H. Lee Jr., a prominent cardiologist. ''If you put patients on generics,'' he said, ''the chances that they're taking their medications six months later are higher than on a brand name drug. I think that a few hundred dollars a year does matter.''
 But Pfizer argues that Lipitor is the most effective statin and that patients who are having good results with it are not well-served by moving to another drug. 
 ''The only reason one would want to switch from one drug to another is for the benefit of the patient's health,'' said Dr. Michael Berelowitz, senior vice president for worldwide medical affairs for Pfizer. 
 In September Pfizer began sounding safety alarms by citing an analysis of the medical histories of 2,500 people in Britain who switched to simvastatin from Lipitor, compared with 9,000 who did not make the change. The study concluded that patients who switched were more likely to have a heart attack or stroke than those who remained on Lipitor.
 The results were presented on a poster at a European cardiology conference. And Dr. Berelowitz said the study had been accepted by the British Journal of Cardiology and would soon be published.
 But independent researchers say that limitations in the study, which was conducted by Pfizer's own researchers, gives it little predictive power about what will happen to patients who take simvastatin instead of Lipitor. And they say the study is far less important than large clinical trials that have shown simvastatin's effectiveness at reducing cholesterol. 
 ''It will run counter to everything that's been published to date if it's true,'' Dr. Lee said of the Pfizer study. He is president of the network of about 5,000 doctors in Partners HealthCare, the health system formed by Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
 Dr. Mark Fendrick, a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan and a specialist in health care economics, notes that for patients with extremely high cholesterol, Lipitor may be a better choice. An 80-milligram daily dose of Lipitor, the top dose, can reduce cholesterol by up to 60 percent, compared with about 50 percent for an 80-milligram dose of simvastatin, also the top dose. 
 But most patients with moderately high cholesterol take 10 or 20 milligrams of Lipitor a day, and can get comparable benefit from 40 or 80 milligrams of simvastatin, Dr. Fendrick said. 
 Dr. Robert O. Bonow, the chief of cardiology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago and a past president of the American Heart Association, said patients' cholesterol levels should be monitored after the change, to make sure the simvastatin is having the desired effect. 
 ''Switching itself is not a problem,'' Dr. Bonow said. ''It's not that one drug has more risk or less risk.'' 
 Lipitor's share of the cholesterol-lowering drug market in this country has ebbed to 30 percent, down from 40 percent 18 months ago, when simvastatin was available only as name-brand Zocor -- at prices that were higher than Lipitor's. 
 No generic version of Lipitor is in the offing because the Lipitor patent remains valid until at least March 2010. But the advent of generic Zocor has dented sales enough to hurt Pfizer's stock, which is trading near its lowest level in a decade.
 In a recent conference call with Wall Street analysts, Pfizer vowed to step up its efforts to protect Lipitor. So far this year, the company has been spending more than 50 percent more on advertising the drug than it did in 2006, when its Lipitor ad spending for the year totaled $142.7 million.
 Lately, Pfizer has been running a print and broadcast advertising campaign that features Dr. Robert Jarvik, the inventor of the artificial heart, endorsing Lipitor. 
 ''There's a common misconception that all cholesterol-lowering medications are the same,'' Dr. Jarvik says in a radio ad. ''They're not. There is no generic version of Lipitor.''
 Despite Pfizer's efforts, analysts and physicians say they see little chance of the company's stemming the generic tide. After two decades of prescribing cholesterol-lowering drugs, doctors are comfortable with both Lipitor and simvastatin, said Dr. Jon LeCroy, who is an industry analyst at Natixis Bleichroeder and a physician.
 Insurers and pharmacy benefits companies are spurring patients to switch mainly by raising their out-of-pocket co-payments if they choose Lipitor, while lowering them for generic drugs. On Oct. 1, for example, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois raised the average co-payment for Lipitor by $10 to $20 a month, said Bridget Houlihan, a Blue Cross spokeswoman. 
 This year, Blue Care Network, a health maintenance organization affiliated with Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Michigan, offered to pay $100 to physicians for each patient who filled a prescription for a generic statin. 
 Pfizer is sponsoring a speaking tour by Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, a former secretary of Health and Human Services, who without citing Lipitor specifically is arguing against insurers' efforts to influence medical decisions. 
 The company has also been fighting the generics trend in the political arena. In a Sept. 10 letter to state lawmakers in Ohio, a Pfizer lobbyist cited the potential risks of switching to cheaper medicines.
 That letter, from Linda Martens, Pfizer's assistant director of government relations in Ohio, noted the company's British study, saying it showed a 30 percent increase in cardiac risks ''in patients who were switched from the leading cholesterol-lowering medicine, Lipitor, to another statin drug, simvastatin.''
 Independent researchers, however, say that the British study is of little value in comparing the two drugs, because it was not based on a clinical trial in which the two drugs were given to two randomly assigned groups of patients. 
 Instead, the Pfizer researchers simply compared the case histories of patients who had been switched with those who had not, regardless of the reasons they were taken off Lipitor. The results of the study are contradicted by a 9,000-patient clinical trial published in 2005, which found no statistically significant difference between Lipitor and Zocor.
 Even a Pfizer doctor involved in the British study, Dr. Berkeley Phillips, said in an interview with the online publication WebMD that it did not prove that Lipitor worked better than simvastatin. ''We can't say from this study that switching is bad or that one statin is better than another,'' Dr. Phillips said. ''You would need a randomized clinical trial to say that.''

HEADLINE: Talking Point for Rodriguez? $350 Million

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
It turns out there might have been a magic number that could have gotten the Yankees the meeting they wanted with Alex Rodriguez: $350 million. That was the minimum bid the Yankees would have apparently had to make to begin negotiations with Rodriguez before he opted out of his contract during Game 4 of the World Series last Sunday.
 ''The only thing that matters anymore is the fact that we're looking for a third baseman,'' General Manager Brian Cashman said yesterday. ''The rest of the stuff I'm just not going to waste my time getting into. That ship has sailed.'' 
 Rodriguez's agent, Scott Boras, gave Cashman the $350 million figure as the starting point for any meeting with him or Rodriguez, according to a major league executive with knowledge of the situation who was not authorized to speak publicly. The figure was first reported yesterday by ESPN.com. In essence, the Yankees would have been committing that much money just to have Rodriguez walk into their Tampa, Fla., offices, which he never did.
 Asked Thursday night about the $350 million figure, Boras said, ''I've had no discussions with the Yankees about economics.''
 The Yankees' position now is that Rodriguez is gone, because a major discount from his side is unrealistic. If the Yankees chased Rodriguez, after their firm public stance against doing it, they would lose credibility with agents and teams in future negotiations.
 The Yankees were prepared to extend the existing contract for Rodriguez, who is 32, by five years and give him a raise over his $25.2 million average annual salary, perhaps to as much as $30 million a season through 2015.
 But Boras views Rodriguez's salary as $32 million because of escalator clauses for 2009 and 2010 in his original deal. The Yankees never seemed willing to go that high, but several clubs, including the San Francisco Giants and the Florida Marlins, have said they would at least explore the idea of signing Rodriguez.
 ABREU HAPPY TO BE BACK Before he formally exercised the Yankees' $16 million option on right fielder Bobby Abreu yesterday, Brian Cashman called Abreu to make sure he still wanted to be a Yankee.
 Abreu replied enthusiastically, said his agent, Peter Greenberg, and Cashman agreed to let Abreu play winter ball again. Abreu was cleared to play 10 games or so as the designated hitter for Caracas in Venezuela.
 ''That will be good for him, to get him focused early in the winter,'' Greenberg said. ''The Yankees didn't want him to play last year, and he took some vacations and he wasn't ready. This year, he wants to get back to that.''
 Abreu injured a rib-cage muscle in spring training, and although he said he was fine, he batted only .228 through the end of May. From June 1 through the end of the season, he hit .309 and the Yankees surged along with him.
 ''He's been an asset since we acquired him,'' Cashman said. ''We're happy that right field is not a concern for us.''
 Abreu, 33, would like to stay with the Yankees beyond 2008, and while Greenberg said he would be open to discussing a contract extension, Cashman said he had many more issues to address first.
 Greenberg also represents the Minnesota Twins left-hander Johan Santana, who will be highly sought in trades if the Twins offer him to other teams. Greenberg said the Twins have told him Santana was not available yet.
 ''They've made some indications that they'd like to try to keep him and take another shot at trying to sign him,'' Greenberg said. ''We'll have to wait and see.''
 RED SOX RETAIN WAKEFIELD The Red Sox picked up the knuckleballer Tim Wakefield's $4 million option yesterday. Wakefield missed the World Series because of inflammation behind his right shoulder. Boston also exercised a $3.85 million option on the right-hander Julian Tavarez, announced that catcher Kevin Cash had declined an outright assignment to Class AAA Pawtucket and had decided to become a free agent, and acquired the minor league outfielder Sean Danielson from St. Louis to complete a July 31 trade that sent the right-hander Joel Pineiro to the Cardinals. (AP) FARRELL OUT OF PIRATES' SEARCH The Red Sox pitching coach John Farrell withdrew his name from consideration yesterday for the Pittsburgh Pirates' managing job. Farrell has said he wants to manage, and he moved from Cleveland's front office to Boston's bench last season partly for that reason. Farrell said it was the wrong time to leave a team that had won a World Series. (AP)

HEADLINE: Bloomberg's Pay Raises for Unions May Trouble the City After He Leaves

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL; Jo Craven McGinty contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Amid the gloomy talk of subprime mortgage failures, tumbling profits on Wall Street and a cooling real estate market, one powerful force squeezing New York City's budget has gone largely undiscussed: the sharply rising cost of municipal labor.
 As Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has moved to settle contracts extending past the end of his term in 2009, he has agreed to more generous pay raises for union after union, leading to expenses that stand to outpace revenue, especially toward the end of the city's four-year spending plan. 
 In July, the city settled a retroactive contract with the police sergeants' union that increased their pay by 27.5 percent over six years, bringing the maximum base salary to $94,962 at the end of the contract in 2011, up from $76,403. A week later, Mr. Bloomberg struck a deal to raise wages of sanitation workers 17 percent over four and a half years, bringing the maximum salary to $67,141 from $57,392. Last month, Mr. Bloomberg announced a similar increase over four years for the police detectives that would bring the maximum base pay for a first-grade detective to $109,002 from $93,176.
 Those agreements, along with those made with the police captains' and fire officers' unions, will cost the city roughly $300 million in the last two years of the contracts and have helped establish a pattern for wage increases of 4 percent each year for city employees, with an additional 1.59 percent over two years for the uniformed services.
 City officials have recently factored the higher salary projections into their spending plan for all employees, regardless of whether they have settled contracts. 
 That revised plan, submitted last week to the Financial Control Board, which oversees the city's finances, anticipates that labor costs, rather than declining revenue, will become the driving force in widening deficits over the next four years.
 According to the revised plan, a decline in tax collections will account for 60 percent of the expected $396 million contributing to a shortage this fiscal year, and new labor agreements will account for 23 percent. By 2011, however, the final year of the plan, tax revenue is expected to be responsible for 34 percent of the $2.5 billion swelling the deficit and labor responsible for 65 percent.
 Earlier this week, Mr. Bloomberg instituted a citywide hiring freeze and directed agencies to devise spending cuts, the first time he has resorted to such actions since 2002, when the city was struggling with the economic effects of a recession and the 9/11 attack.
 Several budget analysts praised Mr. Bloomberg's move to trim costs as prudent, but warned that unions could come to expect at least a 4 percent raise each year, even as the budget squeeze tightens.
 The mayor, said Doug Turetsky, a spokesman for the city's Independent Budget Office, ''deserves credit for anticipating that we're going to need money further down the road.'' But, he said, ''That would appear to set the floor for negotiations in terms of how much is available at a higher place than it has been in the recent past.''
 Since guiding the city out of the fiscal problems he faced upon taking office in 2002, Mr. Bloomberg has enjoyed flush times, and has been able to increase spending on popular items like additional library hours and tax cuts, while banking surpluses for the future.
 But now, even as he seeks to burnish his image and may even test his popularity nationally, he may confront starker choices than any he has grappled with since those early days. It may be increasingly difficult to maintain the city's work force, which provides the services and amenities Mr. Bloomberg says are so crucial.
 If the economy gets much worse, said E. J. McMahon, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, a conservative research organization, ''and they're really in the hole, the only way to really save money is to reduce head count, unless the unions begin to make the kinds of concessions that they've never actually made.'' 
 Since Mr. Bloomberg took office in 2002, city spending on wages and salaries, including pension and health care benefits, has grown to $32 billion from $27 billion, adjusted for inflation, with an average annual growth rate of 4 percent. Under his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, those costs increased to $26 billion from $23 billion, about a 2 percent annual increase.
 Those costs are now expected to rise to almost $40 billion by 2011, nearly equivalent to the entire city budget in 2001. 
 City officials argue that they have flexibility in how they settle contracts; they can extract concessions like longer workdays or fewer holidays in exchange for higher wages, they say, or perhaps even put off longer-term agreements if they do not have the money to pay for them.
 Some fiscal analysts say the city has locked itself into costly work agreements, in part by following a decades-old practice called pattern bargaining. Under that approach, if one union extracts an agreement for a salary increase, the city often extends the same increase to other unions when their contracts come up for negotiation.
 The Bloomberg administration has vigorously defended the practice in arbitration, as it resists a push to give pay increases that are higher than those for other city workers to the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the largest police union, representing 23,000 officers.
 ''It's pretty expensive given the economic outlook,'' said Charles Brecher, research director at the Citizens Budget Commission, a business-backed policy group. Administration officials ''have hoisted themselves on their own petard in that they've fought the P.B.A. by saying that there should be a strict pattern,'' he said.
 But city officials say they can manage the city's finances better by settling contracts before they expire and for longer terms, as well as by factoring into the spending plan the established pattern across all unions, including those that have not agreed to terms, like District Council 37, with 99,000 members. 
 ''In tough times we've been able to work with the unions to find collaborative methods for cost savings, but the reality is once you set the parameters, different unions are going to get similar amounts regardless,'' said Edward Skyler, the deputy mayor who oversees both the budget and labor negotiations. ''You have to deal with these expenses whether you put them in the financial plan now or later. Not including them at this point would be burying your head in the sand.''

HEADLINE: Mayors, Looking to Cities' Future, Are Told It Must Be Colored Green

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
The mayor of Fayetteville, Ark., gushed through a slide show about how his city was in the midst of great change. Bleak roads and bland shopping strips were being redrawn to a more human scale. Downtown condominiums were going for a million dollars. Streets once silent at night now bustled.
 Besides being great for the local economy, the mayor, Dan Coody, told his counterparts from other cities gathered here, the redevelopment is also helping Fayetteville go green. 
 ''I'm so excited to be here and talk about this I can't stand it,'' Mr. Coody said at the end of his presentation on Thursday. ''Let's all go save the world!''
 They settled for lunch, at least for the moment, but the 100 or so mayors who attended the two-day Climate Protection Summit, convened by the United States Conference of Mayors, heard a clear message: Cities that are ''walkable,'' workable and livable add up to the ''s'' word: sustainable. Cities that are centered on people and public transit, not cars, and built to higher standards of energy efficiency will save money, hum with new development and create jobs to suit a greener way of life.
 Al Gore said as much in a speech he gave to the mayors via satellite. So did former President Bill Clinton, in an address here on Thursday, and Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, who spoke Friday.
 But many mayors spoke of the struggle of convincing voters that investing in green is good for them. John Robert Smith, the mayor of Meridian, Miss., said he had been criticized for supporting a plan to restore streetcar service in his city decades after autos made it seem obsolete.
 ''This is one of those things you do in your last term in office,'' Mr. Smith said, ''because they'll be sure you've lost your mind.''
 Part pep rally, part policy discussion, the conference presented two main themes: the federal government must do more than the Bush administration has done to fight global warming; and in the meantime, cities must take up the slack.
 Spurred by Mayor Greg Nickels of Seattle, more than 700 mayors have signed a pledge to reduce their cities' emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases to levels laid out in the Kyoto Protocol. That treaty, signed by the United States but never ratified by the Senate, called for reducing such emissions 7 percent below 1990 levels by 2012. 
 Mr. Nickels issued a report this week showing that Seattle had already exceeded that goal. On Friday, he listed city initiatives like promoting locally produced foods, distributing 300,000 high-efficiency shower heads and encouraging residents to trade in their gasoline-powered mowers for electric or nonmotorized versions. But it helps that Seattle gets its power from hydroelectric dams, not coal or natural gas.
 Many mayors here said they had yet to measure how much pollution their cities were causing, much less win political support for reducing it. ''You just can't say we need to reduce global warming because there will be floods and polar bears will be gone,'' said Mayor Douglas H. Palmer of Trenton, president of the Conference of Mayors. ''They'll run me out of town.''
 Mr. Palmer said he talked about the issue at home in a way residents could relate to. Pollution is bad for your child's asthma. Leaky buildings and dependency on foreign energy sources can drive up monthly heating bills. Instead of working in a fast-food restaurant, young people could be trained in ''green collar jobs,'' like retrofitting older buildings to be more efficient and installing solar panels.
 Capitalism and consumerism were at the core of the meetings. Mr. Clinton announced that he had negotiated with private companies to help 1,100 cities buy energy-efficient products at volume discounts. Sessions had names like ''Blueprints for Building a Green City'' and ''Engaging Your Business Community.''
 Mayors from big and small cities, from Anchorage to Miami, talked about their conversions to green thinking and discussed how to decipher ''green building codes'' and force developers to abide by them. Some said they had found developers unwilling. Others urged them just to apply more pressure.
 The conference had a decidedly Democratic tilt, but there were Republicans here, too, and the frustration with Washington on the issue of climate change was apparent across political lines. Mr. Bloomberg, who was elected mayor twice as a Republican but who switched his affiliation to independent in June, announced his support for the controversial idea of a federal tax on carbon pollution.
 ''As long as greenhouse-gas pollution is free, it will be abundant,'' he said. ''If we want to reduce it, there has to be a cost for producing it.''

HEADLINE: Palestinian President Meets With Hamas Officials for the First Time Since June

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, met Friday with a group of Hamas leaders in the West Bank, the first time he has done so since Hamas routed Fatah forces in Gaza in June.
 Mr. Abbas, of the Fatah faction, said the meeting in his Ramallah office was not the beginning of a formal dialogue with Hamas. Instead, it seemed to be an effort to split more moderate Hamas officials in the West Bank from their more militant brethren in Gaza.
 Hamas has said regularly since June that it wants to talk to Mr. Abbas about reconstituting a unity government with Fatah, but Mr. Abbas has said that Hamas must first apologize for its ''coup'' in Gaza, pull back from buildings taken at the time and restore security officials, nearly all from Fatah, to their posts. 
 The United States and Israel have warned Mr. Abbas not to negotiate with Hamas or return to a shared government with them. Hamas won elections in January 2006, and Mr. Abbas agreed to a Hamas-led unity government last March before firing Prime Minister Ismail Haniya, of Hamas, after the June fighting. Then Mr. Abbas appointed an emergency government led by the economist Salam Fayyad, who is backed by the West but whose writ runs only to the West Bank.
 Mr. Abbas has been cooperating with Israeli and American efforts to isolate Hamas in Gaza and increase pressure on its leaders there by closing it off to normal trade or travel, either through Israel or Egypt.
 Still, if international talks on Middle East peace organized by the United States fail later this year, some Palestinians believe that Mr. Abbas may once again negotiate with Hamas.
 The radical Islamic movement is also powerful in the West Bank, but it is weaker and more underground than in Gaza because of the Israeli occupation and the campaign that Fatah has led against it since June. In the West Bank, Fatah has closed many Hamas offices, arrested Hamas members and clerics and tried to prevent the circulation of its newspapers.
 In Gaza, a more militant Hamas wing appears to be in control. When Ghazi Hamad, a former Haniya spokesman who is a relative moderate, wrote an internal letter three months ago calling for negotiations with Israel, political openness and re-engagement with Fatah, he was pushed to repudiate his words when they became public. 
 Mr. Hamad, who has said that the takeover of Gaza by Hamas was a reactive mistake, has been told to keep silent, as has another Haniya adviser, Ahmed Yousef, who had tried to present a more moderate Hamas face to Europe and the West.
 On Friday, Mr. Abbas was host to a group that included Nasser al-Shaer, former deputy prime minister in the first Hamas government; Ahmed Abu Ruman; Hussein Abu Qweik; and Ayman Daraghmeh. They first attended Friday Prayer in a mosque in Mr. Abbas's compound, then met in his office. 
 Mr. Shaer had criticized the comments of some Hamas leaders in Gaza, who bragged that they would be praying in Mr. Abbas's West Bank compound soon, as they were now praying at his headquarters in Gaza. 
 ''The Hamas movement rejects the principle of violent infighting in the West Bank,'' Mr. Shaer said. ''We support the general attitude to achieving social peace and security.''
 He said the Hamas men had discussed with Mr. Abbas ''the internal situation in the Palestinian territories in an open manner.''
 Mr. Shaer added, ''This sends a positive signal to our people and decreases tension.'' He said he hoped it would be a prelude to dialogue.
 Nabil Abu Rudeineh, an Abbas aide, said that the president was not opposed to Hamas, only to its coup. ''As President Abbas said, Hamas is part of the Palestinian people,'' he said. ''Our problem is with a small group who rose against legitimate authority.''
 There have been quiet talks among some senior Hamas and Fatah members who believe that the Palestinians cannot remain split for long. But others in Fatah agree with Israel and Washington that Hamas's call for dialogue is disingenuous, that it has no intention of giving up control in Gaza and that it will act to disrupt any progress toward peace with Israel.
 In Nablus on Friday, Mr. Fayyad, who is trying to restore stability and law to the West Bank, presided over the deployment of 308 police reinforcements newly trained by the United States in Jericho, with 200 more to come. The men, in olive uniforms and with new Kalashnikovs, are supposed to operate in coordination with Israeli forces to fight crime and terrorism as part of the Palestinian National Security Forces.
 Mr. Fayyad said, ''The Palestinian Authority must make its presence felt so that people feel secure,'' and called the deployment part of a ''security plan to restore law and order to all the Palestinian territories.''
 If the plan is successful, Israel will allow Mr. Fayyad to deploy similar forces to other areas, but primary responsibility for acting against terrorist groups will remain with Israeli forces.

HEADLINE: Bush Sees Iraq Progress From Troop Buildup

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: FORT JACKSON, S.C., Nov. 2 

 BODY:
President Bush offered an upbeat assessment on Friday of progress in Iraq, saying that while corruption remained a problem and unemployment was high, the economy was growing, violence was down and, ''slowly but surely, the people of Iraq are reclaiming a normal society.''
 Speaking to 1,300 graduates of the Army's basic training camp here, Mr. Bush gave his first progress report on Iraq since September, when he announced that his troop buildup would come to an end by next spring, with reductions beginning at the end of this year. 
 In the September speech, the president called the new strategy ''return on success,'' a phrase he reiterated in his remarks here on Friday.
 To make his case that the strategy is working, Mr. Bush ticked off a litany of statistics. Since the buildup was completed in June, he said, the number of attacks each week involving I.E.D.'s, or improvised explosive devices, had dropped by half. The number of American military deaths, he said, had fallen to its lowest level in 19 months.
 With Karbala Province moving to Iraqi control this week, Mr. Bush said Iraqis were now responsible for security in 8 of Iraq's 18 provinces.
 ''The Iraqis are becoming more capable, and our military commander tells me that these gains are making possible what I call 'return on success,''' Mr. Bush said. ''That means we're slowly bringing some of our troops home -- and now we're doing it from a position of strength.''
 Mr. Bush typically finds friendly audiences at military bases, and Friday was no exception; the graduates and their relatives and friends applauded wildly as he arrived on the grassy parade field here, and they interrupted his remarks several times with foot stomping and cheers. 
 The speech came as Mr. Bush was pressing the Democratic-controlled Congress to approve an emergency spending bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Debate on the spending bill may not take place until early next year, but some are already predicting that the Democrats may make another attempt to force Mr. Bush to shift strategy in Iraq, in order to bring the troops home more quickly than he had planned. 
 In a statement responding to Mr. Bush's speech, the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, accused the president of ''overstating the security situation'' in Iraq. 
 ''While the decrease in U.S. and Iraqi civilian deaths is welcome news, violence remains high in Iraq,'' Mr. Reid said. ''Our primary goal -- political reconciliation -- is still out of reach, and Iraqi security forces have not met the responsibilities the president himself laid out for them when he announced his escalation strategy in January.''
 When Mr. Bush first announced the troop buildup in January, he said it was intended to give the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki ''breathing space'' to build a cohesive central government that could bridge the sectarian divisions that were ripping Iraq apart. Mr. Bush conceded Friday that ''reconciliation at the national level hasn't been what we hoped it'd been by now,'' and said he had ''made my disappointments clear to the Iraqi leadership.''
 But he argued, as he has in the past, that reconciliation was taking place at the local level, and that Shiite and Sunni leaders were beginning to cooperate with one another to fight against Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, a homegrown extremist group that American intelligence agencies say is foreign-led. 
 Mr. Bush also took the unusual step of offering a body-count figure, saying that together with Iraqi forces, American troops had killed or captured an average of more than 1,500 ''enemy fighters'' per month since January. 
 On the economic front, the president argued that Iraqi society was beginning to return to normal.
 ''We're seeing improvements in important economic indicators,'' he said. ''Inflation has been cut in half. Electricity production in September reached its highest levels since the war began -- and higher than it was under Saddam Hussein.''

HEADLINE: With Resolution Unlikely, Writers Guild Sets Strike for Monday

BYLINE: By MICHAEL CIEPLY and BROOKS BARNES; Edward Wyatt contributed reporting from Los Angeles, and Jacques Steinberg and Andrew Tangel from New York.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
When the sun rises here on Monday morning, movie and television writers will be ready to head for their assigned picket lines outside Hollywood's studios and production sites.
 By the time it sets, the entertainment industry's new reality will have settled in: Writers and their employers, who together rode a boom of expanding revenues in the last two decades, are now on opposite sides of the future.
 At a press conference in Los Angeles on Friday, leaders of the Writers Guild of America West and the Writers Guild of America East said they would order their members to stop work just after midnight Sunday. That will begin Hollywood's first industrywide strike since 1988. 
 ''We're sorry that the studios have put us where we are,'' said Patric M. Verrone, president of the West Coast guild, speaking at the press gathering. Flanked by colleagues and by a photo montage titled ''Earthquakes in Hollywood,'' Mr. Verrone added: ''It's our sense that we can do some economic damage immediately.'' 
 Absent a unlikely last-minute resolution, picket lines are expected to start appearing in Los Angeles and New York in the morning hours. Already on Friday, writers spread leaflets outside NBC's offices in Manhattan at Rockefeller Center, explaining why they are seeking a bigger share of billions of dollars in revenue collected by the studios and networks. 
 Guild writers are demanding a sharp increase in what they are paid for the use of movies and TV programs on DVDs and online. Producers, represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, have refused. They argue that companies like the News Corporation's Fox studio and network or General Electric's NBC and Universal Pictures operations must use new revenue to cover rising costs.
 The result of this standoff is likely to be a gradual halt in the production of all television shows, except for reality and news programs, and of new movies. Viewers will notice the fallout first among entertainment talk shows. ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart,'' ''The Colbert Report,'' ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' and ''The Tonight Show With Jay Leno'' have said they will revert to repeats on Monday, at least for now. 
 If the strike is a long one -- and nothing in the bitter negotiations so far signals otherwise -- the dispute may well realign the industry's relationship with Hollywood's creative class. 
 ''A strike is the labor equivalent of a nuclear bomb, and I'm surprised both sides wielded it so quickly,'' said Tom Pollock, a veteran film producer and a partner in the Montecito Picture Company. The last strike, which lasted five months, left Hollywood's underlying structure intact, he added. But this time, he said: ''All outcomes are possible.'' 
 This week's expiration of the writers' contract will be followed in June by the end of deals with actors and directors. Any new aggressiveness by guild members is already being matched, if not bettered, by companies that are equally set on protecting their share of income from digital distribution systems that are only now beginning to become significant businesses. 
 Hollywood's guilds, with their elite membership, have been seen by executives as a necessary, if sometimes pesky, adjunct in a business where many workers are employed project by project. The unions help administer health and pension plans, sort through credits, and impose structure on the seeming chaos of movie and television production sets.
 But the approaching storm will sorely test that relationship.
 On Friday, companies and writers alike planned for the coming confrontation. In New York, the writer-producers who run East Coast television productions like ''All My Children,'' the long-running ABC soap opera, and ''Gossip Girl,'' a CW show produced by Warner Brothers, were asked to attend a 4 p.m. meeting at the guild's headquarters.
 Those so-called showrunners, the thousand or so people who share both writing and managerial duties on television shows, have already been squeezed by conflicting demands from guild leaders and company employers. The guilds have strongly urged them not to cross picket lines to perform their managerial duties. But producers have pointed out that individual employment contracts require writer-producers to report for work, even if they withhold their writing services.
 John Bowman, who heads the writers' negotiating team, has decided to halt all of his work on the coming TBS series ''Frank TV,'' of which he is an executive producer. ''I am not doing it, and I can be legally fired,'' he said.
 During the leaflet distribution at Rockefeller Center on Friday, more than 50 writers spent an hour pleading their case with passers-by. ''We're certainly not claiming we're coal miners,'' said Brian Kiley, a monologue writer for ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien. ''But at the same time, we don't want to be taken advantage of.''
 In Los Angeles, the West Coast guild this week advised writers to begin removing their personal possessions from studio offices in anticipation of the walkout. Actors are expected to join writers on Monday in a show of support on the picket lines. But current contracts with actors, directors and most other film workers bar them from joining the strike. 
 Hollywood's Teamsters, by contrast, are permitted to honor picket lines as an individual act of conscience without penalty under their contract. If many choose to do so, studio and network executives might eventually be forced to close productions or shift them to locations with more accommodating transportation workers.
 As strike preparations unfolded, company executives largely maintained public silence, leaving communication to the negotiating group, headed by J. Nicholas Counter III. ''We are very disappointed with their press conference and with the action they took,'' Mr. Counter said in a statement on Friday. Calling the guilds' strike call ''precipitous and irresponsible,'' he added that working writers ''on average earn over $200,000 a year,'' receive high-quality health benefits, and are among ''the few employees in the world who get an 'additional annuity''' in the form of residual payments.
 The few public (and soothing) comments from media moguls came during conference calls with analysts. ''I don't think anybody escapes this, but in terms of the immediate production and delivery of our slate for 2008, we will not be impacted,'' Jeffrey Katzenberg, chief executive of DreamWorks Animation, told analysts on Tuesday, noting that animators belong to a union other than the writers guilds.
 Around Los Angeles County, where about 254,000 people work in the entertainment industry, agencies and production companies are already considering layoffs and cost-cutting to cope with the anticipated slowdown.
 Matters as far afield as Oscar promotions will be touched. ''It definitely affects campaigns,'' said Amanda Lundberg, a partner with the New York-based publicity firm 42 West, noting that film publicists rely on the likes of Jay Leno and David Letterman to promote their wares. 
 Similarly, thousands of businesses, whether mom-and-pop companies that train dogs for television shows or lumberyards that specialize in building materials for sets, face consequences. ''I'm really scared,'' said Oren Ashkenazi, owner of TVC Television and Cinema Wardrobe Cleaners, near the Warner Brothers lot in Burbank, Calif. The cleaner processes up to 2,000 garments each night for television programs like ''24.''
 Antonio R. Villaraigosa, the mayor of Los Angeles, has offered to broker a peace between the sides, according to a spokesman. So far, he has had no luck. (A federal mediator has called the two sides together for a meeting on Sunday morning.)
 While many businesses hope to avoid a strike, some may be better positioned for a walkout than others. Reality television, which largely does not rely on guild writers, is a big profit center for the William Morris Agency, while smaller agencies like Paradigm can fall back on music clients like Fergie, Coldplay and the Dave Matthews Band.
 ''Music is a huge business that has nothing to do with a writers' strike,'' said Sam Gores, Paradigm's chairman.
 And new entertainment may be born from the turmoil. The Fox network, which had its debut just months before the last writers' strike, got a bump from channel-changing audiences who discovered overlooked reruns of the fledgling sitcom ''Married, With Children,'' and made it an enduring hit, television historians say.

HEADLINE: 'Pay as You Go' Is Shaping Up As a Problem In the Senate

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
Senate Democrats face an agonizing choice in the days ahead: find a way to raise at least $50 billion in new taxes, or undermine their most important rule for enforcing budget discipline.
 With the end of the year fast approaching, Congress has to pass another one-year fix to prevent the alternative minimum tax -- a tax originally created to make sure millionaires paid income taxes -- from engulfing about 23 million households with incomes as low as $50,000.
Democrats and Republicans alike want to prevent that increase, just as they have in the past, but the one-year cost has ballooned and Democratic ''pay as you go'' rules now require Congress to make up for the lost revenue. 
 On Thursday, the House Ways and Means Committee approved a $76 billion bill that would freeze the alternative minimum tax, extend several other tax breaks and pay for that mainly by eliminating a major tax break for people who run private equity funds and scores of other investment partnerships.
 But Senate Democrats are less than enthusiastic about that tax increase, and they worry that they cannot muster the 60-vote majority they will need to pass any measure that would comply with the pay-as-you-go rule.
 Senator Max Baucus of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, has been silent about the issue for weeks, promising only to be ''as fiscally responsible as possible.''
 Skirting the budget rules would be a huge embarrassment to Democrats, who bitterly accused Republicans of being fiscally irresponsible for passing tax cuts without trying to pay for them. After Democrats took majority control in the House and Senate this year, lawmakers in both chambers adopted stringent ''pay-go'' rules to highlight their differences with Republicans.
 But Democrats acknowledge they are in a tight spot. With a tiny majority in the Senate, and Republicans insisting on 60 votes to limit debate, Democrats have been hard-pressed to pass any legislation without wooing at least a handful of Republicans.
 Making matters more difficult, some Senate Democrats are quietly opposed to proposals for raising taxes on private equity funds, whose executives have become important Democratic donors.
 ''I'm not one for raising the white flag of surrender, but it's going to be hard,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon and a member of the tax-writing committee. ''Securing all those hard dollars is going to be a big lift.''
 The House Ways and Means Committee's bill would freeze the alternative minimum tax for one year, at a cost of $50.59 billion. It would also extend more than $20 billion in other popular tax breaks for individuals, like the child tax credit and the deduction for college tuition expenses. And it would extend several business tax breaks, including the tax credit for research and development.
 To pay for that, the House bill would rely mainly on three provisions that raise taxes over 10 years. One would limit the ability of corporate executives to defer part of their income and their taxes, raising $24 billion. Another $25 billion would come by postponing a tax cut for multinational companies that was supposed to take effect next year. 
 But the most controversial provision could be to raise $25 billion by revoking a tax break on ''carried interest'' -- income earned by investment managers at private equity funds, venture capital funds, real estate funds and other partnerships. Under current rules, much of that income is taxed as capital gains at 15 percent rather than as individual income at rates of up to 39.6 percent.
 Executives at private equity firms and hedge funds, as well as venture capitalists, have been generous contributors to Democrats. Executives at the Carlyle Group, one of the world's biggest private equity firms, have contributed to both parties. Carlyle executives contributed more than $30,000 to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee this year and made contributions to numerous individual Democrats, including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut. 
 But private equity firms are hardly the only group that would be hit. Hedge funds contributed $4.4 million to House and Senate campaigns in 2006, and 77 percent of that went to Democrats, according to Congressional Quarterly's moneyline.com. Venture capital firms contributed $6.3 million, with slightly more than half going to Democrats.
 No Senate Democrat has introduced anything similar to the House provision, though the issue has been a subject of vexing debate for months. 
 If Senate Democrats try to find other ways to offset the cost of freezing the alternative minimum tax, they will still encounter heavy resistance from Republicans.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has pushed for simply eliminating the alternative minimum tax without trying to offset the cost. Mr. Grassley and many other Republicans argue that Congress never expected the tax to ensnare ordinary families in the first place.
 The Bush administration has been contradictory. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said the House tax bill would ''hurt the economy'' because it would offset the cost of a one-year fix by raising other taxes. 
 But when President Bush convened an advisory panel in 2005 to propose an overhaul of the entire tax code, the White House instructed the panel to eliminate the alternative minimum tax and make up for the lost revenue by raising taxes elsewhere. 
 Mr. Bush's tax panel came up with two proposals, but the president never followed up with a plan of his own.

HEADLINE: Leaving Corporate Life at 60

BYLINE: By PAUL B. BROWN

 BODY:
LIFE expectancies are increasing. Phrases like ''60 is the new 40'' are becoming increasingly commonplace, and just about every survey shows people invariably feel younger than their chronological age.
 So why is the chairman of Directors & Boards, Robert H. Rock, who is also president of the investment company MLR Holdings, suggesting in the pages of his magazine that it may be a good idea for chief executives to step down once they turn 60?
After all, even Mr. Rock concedes that ''retiring a highly successful C.E.O. at 60 may seem like throwing out a very scarce resource.'' 
 Still, he says, ''in some highly innovative industries'' like investment banking, technology and pharmaceuticals, chief executives frequently retire early.
 ''In these industries, companies stay young by giving up-and-comers the chance to race ahead,'' Mr. Rock writes. ''Change comes fast and companies need to keep up,'' he continues. ''They can stay young by placing a steady flow of younger managers into key positions, including the top spot.''
 For what it is worth, Mr. Rock, who says he is in his late 50s, said he came to his epiphany while attending a Genesis concert with a 60-year-old chief executive, whom he does not identify, and who is about to step down.
 ANTI-AGING BACKLASH? Will people who go to extraordinary (and expensive) measures to look and feel better be subjected to scorn, just like smokers, fur wearers and increasingly those who buy bottled water?
 It could happen, Worth magazine says.
 Not surprisingly as the population ages, there has been increasing interest in anti-aging techniques.
 ''Government and industry officials estimate that at least 30,000 largely affluent Americans have tried the newest age-fighting strategies'' like taking human growth hormone and cutting their calories by a third in the hopes of living significantly longer, Fran Hawthorne writes.
 Since most anti-aging techniques are costly -- $25,000 a regimen seemed to be the going rate, according to examples cited in the article -- and not covered by insurance, they are limited to those who can afford it. And that ''inequity in access to treatments will lead to enormous social resentment that could be exercised in bans or restrictions,'' concludes Arthur Caplan, chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics at the University of Pennsylvania.
 PRICE OF TARGET FUNDS Life-cycle, or target, mutual funds are popular, and a huge part of their appeal is their simplicity. Investors pick a date at which they plan to withdraw their money -- typically the year they plan to begin retirement -- and the fund manager handles all the investment decisions, shifting to more conservative investments as the due date draws nearer.
 But Drew Carrington of UBS Global Asset Management tells Kiplinger's that this simplicity comes with a price. The funds are not as diversified as he believes they need to be and they contain risks that investors may not have considered.
 Specifically, he says even though the funds shift from stocks to bonds and cash equivalent investments as the target date grows near, that does not offset either the potential danger of a spike in inflation or a severe market downturn just before the fund expires. 
 FINAL TAKE Americans are the world's biggest tippers, AARP the Magazine reports, and apparently we offer gratuities in restaurants even when we have our doubts.
 For example, 35 percent of people surveyed said they tip ''even when service is bad'' and 49 percent said they ''feel pressure to leave a tip.''
 In case you were wondering what is the minimum tip you can leave, Peggy Post, an etiquette expert cited in the article, says it is 8 percent. PAUL B. BROWN

HEADLINE: Eco-Education

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN. 
Tamar Lewin is an education reporter for The New York Times.

 BODY:
As the sun goes down over the College of the Atlantic, the cafeteria gets dimmer and dimmer. But only when it is nearly impossible to see the food does a student, finally, get up and turn on the lights -- prompting a collective groan at this wanton use of energy. Another adjusts the lights, bringing them down a notch.
 At the College of the Atlantic, in Bar Harbor, Me., it's all about the environment. The 325 students share the same major, human ecology, and in the one required course, first-year students grapple with what that means.
 ''The core of human ecology is real simple,'' says David F. Hales, president of the college. ''Individual humans exist in a natural and cultural environment, and human ecology is the study of how we relate to those environments.'' 
 While sustainability and the physical environment are certainly major components, the concept of human ecology goes much further, encompassing almost anything students elsewhere study: history, art, physics, literature. But whatever the subject, the focus here is on the interdisciplinary connections that distinguish the college, which has no departments. While all sections of the human ecology course read ''The Great Gatsby,'' they read it alongside Karl Marx, Adam Smith and Barbara Ehrenreich, the author of ''Nickel and Dimed'' -- and the discussion touches on wealth, consumption and social class as well as literary style. 
 Professors from many disciplines teach the class, bringing their own expertise to bear; David P. Feldman, a physicist/mathematician, for example, teaches the use of the Gini coefficient, which measures inequality in income.
 At a time when concerns about climate change are moving higher on the national agenda, and colleges nationwide are thinking about ecological responsibility and how to reduce their carbon emissions, the College of the Atlantic, founded in 1969, pledges to become the nation's first ''net zero'' campus for greenhouse gas emissions by year's end.
 There are almost a dozen small eco-colleges, most offering a mix of hands-on experiential learning, outdoor adventures and liberal arts. It can be hard to tell the players without a scorecard. Northland College, in Wisconsin, calls itself ''The Environmental Liberal Arts College,'' while Prescott College, in Arizona, uses the tagline ''For the Liberal Arts and the Environment.'' Green Mountain College is ''Vermont's Environmental Liberal Arts College.'' And just 80 miles west of Bar Harbor is Unity College, ''America's Environmental College.'' There are even two consortiums of eco-colleges, the Eco League and the North American Alliance for Green Education. 
 The colleges differ substantially: Unity, for one, was founded in 1965 to bolster the local economy after its town was bypassed by the new Interstate. Its student population of 500 is a mix of rural conservatives, many of them avid hunters, and members of the ''1969 Club'' (as the president, Mitchell Thomashow, calls them, because ''they look like I did then''), who are interested in sustainability, local agriculture and ecology. The college has beehives, a maple-sugar shack and a partnership with the outdoor education organization Outward Bound, which every fall takes a group into the wilderness for an entire semester.
 Northland, founded in 1906 near Lake Superior, began its environmental studies program in 1970. It has a wolf project, a loon project -- and N.C.A.A. Division III athletic teams, a rarity among eco-colleges. ''People who have visited all the Eco League schools say we have the most traditional feel,'' says Karen I. Halbersleben, president of Northland, which has 700 students.
 Whatever the eco-colleges are doing seems to be working. Most are getting a growing number of inquiries from potential students, and a growing pool of applicants. ''We call it the green tsunami,'' says Ms. Halbersleben.
 At the extravagantly beautiful College of the Atlantic campus, nestled between Acadia National Park and Frenchman Bay on the Atlantic Ocean, no detail in the quest for sustainability is overlooked: biodegradable linoleum with organic binding glues, environmentally responsible hydrogen peroxide cleanser, biodiesel in the tractors and generators at the research center on Great Duck Island, community garden plots, an organic farm and zero-waste graduation ceremonies. Composting toilets are a periodic topic of discussion at the all-college meeting, which is held every Wednesday.
 At his inauguration last year, Mr. Hales had vowed that the college would avoid, reduce or offset with special projects all contributions to global warming associated with its activities, including travel by students to and from campus -- a daring promise, and not the only one he has made. 
 ''We've said that by 2015, all our activity will be from renewable resources,'' says Mr. Hales. ''We have no idea how to do it, and it's staggeringly complex, but it's important, and I believe higher education is the institution to lead the way. We teach students that individuals can make a difference, and that if you have the opportunity to make a difference, you have the responsibility. We believe that, so we have to act on it.'' 
 In a way, the very smallness of the community, and the lack of academic-department boundaries, encourage large-scale brainstorming -- and not just about energy use. 
 Indeed, Mr. Hales says, the human relationship with spirituality and with computers should also have a place in the curriculum. ''We're still exploring the outer boundaries of human ecology,'' he says. ''Does it include the virtual world, the imaginative world? We're exploring the possibility of virtual classes that involve avatars.'' 
 All students -- of whom about two-thirds are women -- do internships, and a senior project. Classes are tiny, usually 5 to 15 students. Because it is so small, and because students can design their courses of study, the college often connects students with off-campus resources. ''If you want to learn Arabic, we'll work with you, find you a tutor for the rudiments and then probably send you to study abroad for a term,'' says Mr. Hales.
 THE College of the Atlantic, which is listed in The Princeton Review's ''Best 366 Colleges,'' inspires a high level of engagement, according to student surveys. 
 Consider the trajectory of Elsie Flemings, a quiet powerhouse who graduated last year and is now working as coordinator of the Union River Watershed Coalition and thinking about a run for the State Legislature in Maine.
 Ms. Flemings attended Columbia for a year, then took two years off, working and traveling, before arriving at the College of the Atlantic. Her first year there, she organized a course on timber framing, in which 11 students learned the craft of building without nails and constructed a timber-frame barn for the college. She went on to work with SustainUS, a national youth organization, and last year became the nation's sole youth representative at the United Nations' 14th Commission on Sustainable Development. Her project on the economic impact of big-box stores led to a law that was signed last summer: Maine became the first state to require large retail stores to file economic-impact assessments.
 About a fifth of the College of the Atlantic's students are international, and its alumni go into a wide range of careers, with education, natural science and art and design at the top of the list. 
 Nishanta Rajakaruna, who comes from Sri Lanka, graduated in 1994 and returned three years ago to teach botany. In his edible botany class, students nibble on leaves from a stevia plant, discovering the overwhelming sweetness of this weedy herb. First comes classic botany: alternating leaves, the asteracae family, scientific name Stevia rebaudiana Bertoni, commonly called sugar leaf. But the discussion progresses to how the plant has been used by the Guarani Indians for hundreds of years; how it offers a noncaloric, noncarbohydrate sweetener, safe for diabetics but not approved as a sweetener by the F.D.A.; and how commercial interests shape what comes to market.
 Even for seasoned College of the Atlantic students, the definition of human ecology is a continuing theme. ''Yesterday, a group of us, all seniors, were sitting around, saying, 'So what is human ecology?' '' says Ashlesha Khadse, who after a three-month Spanish immersion in Central America is now deep in plans for her senior project on the loss of crop diversity in Mexico and Guatemala. ''It's a way of looking at things and also a way of acting. I'm from India, and you're supposed to study something like engineering, so I came here without any interest in ecology. But it has taken me over.''

HEADLINE: As Hybrids Evolve, Gains Grow Elusive

BYLINE: By DENNIS NORMILE

DATELINE: Toyota City, Japan 

 BODY:
 HYBRID cars made immediate headlines nearly a decade ago, when Honda and then Toyota introduced models that offered drivers moon-shot improvements in fuel economy and exhaust emissions. 
 Today, those leaps of progress are proving tough to repeat: as new technologies develop and gasoline-electric powertrains become available in a wider range of models, the gains over existing hybrids seem more incremental than startling. 
 And even when new twists in technology do arrive -- developments that include plug-in hybrids, which can be recharged on household current to give them more driving distance on batteries alone -- it may be impossible to give buyers a measure of how much the advances help because there is no test to measure their mileage. 
 A recent drive in Japan of a prototype Toyota Prius plug-in hybrid demonstrated both Toyota's progress in developing vehicles that make more use of their electric drive systems and the challenges in bringing them to market. 
 By putting its considerable engineering and marketing muscle into making the Prius the best-selling hybrid car, Toyota established a reputation as a green leader among automakers. But that image has been questioned by environmental groups that assail Toyota's push into big trucks, its stance on proposed United States fuel economy standards and its participation in a lawsuit challenging California's right to limit carbon dioxide emissions. 
 Reasserting its position as the biggest seller of hybrids just before the Tokyo auto show opened last month, Toyota let journalists drive what is likely to be its next step toward what it calls sustainable mobility -- a plug-in hybrid based on the current Prius that would be more miserly with fuel and would reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 
 But before the car reaches showrooms it faces some tough road tests, and even when it does arrive, it probably will not replace existing hybrid designs entirely. 
 For its first step beyond today's hybrids, Toyota is playing it safe. Evaluation vehicles now on the road in Japan -- and soon in the United States -- rely on the same nickel-metal hydride batteries used in today's Prius. The added battery pack is tucked into the spare tire well under the trunk floor.
 Yoshitaka Asakura, an engineer who heads Toyota's hybrid powertrain development efforts, said the company's experience with the all-electric RAV4-EV, which needed special charging equipment, convinced them that consumers would not buy a plug-in vehicle unless it used ordinary household outlets and required just a few hours to charge. So the plug at one end of the power cord will fit a familiar 3-prong outlet; the end that connects to the car looks like the nozzle of a gasoline pump. The prototype charges in 3 to 4 hours at 110 volts. 
 For distances up to seven miles and at cruising speeds of 60 miles an hour, the car can operate strictly on its electric motor. The gas engine kicks in to accelerate up highway on-ramps, for example, or to recharge the batteries for distance driving. 
 Toyota said that better batteries are needed to extend the car's electric-mode range -- and even the most promising prospects may not be good enough. 
 ''Some of our engineers think we must go beyond lithium-ion,'' said Katsuaki Watanabe, president of the Toyota Motor Corporation, referring to what is now the leading battery technology for electric vehicles. 
 Toyota and the Environmental Protection Agency are mulling over how to describe the advantages of adding plug-in capability to a hybrid. The current test, which gives the Prius an E.P.A. estimated mileage of 55 m.p.g. for combined city and highway driving, does not work. Toyota estimates that for a daily commute of 15.5 miles, running costs of this prototype will be about 8 percent lower than the current Prius if the battery is charged during the day, and 41 percent cheaper if charged at off-peak rates where time-of-day electricity pricing is available.
 Cuts in carbon dioxide emissions depend on the source of the electrical power. Toyota calculates that in the United States, with its dependence on coal, the plug-in hybrid would cut carbon emissions 4 percent compared with a conventional Prius; in France, where more nuclear plants generate electricity, the reduction would be 34 percent. 
 All those calculations are based on nickel-metal hydride batteries; going to lithium-ion batteries with greater power storage capacity would increase the benefits. Toyota, like other companies, is working on that technology. The goal is to make the combined battery pack and charger about the size and weight of the current Prius battery, but twice as powerful. 
 Among other benefits, this would mean Toyota could introduce a plug-in Prius without a major model change. But, Mr. Asakura said, the lithium-ion batteries have a long way to go to achieve that performance with acceptable safety, reliability and longevity. 
 At the Tokyo Motor Show, Toyota introduced another possible approach in its 1/X concept vehicle. Rather than increase battery capacity, the 1/X relies on cutting vehicle weight with a carbon-fiber-reinforced body that weighs 925 pounds, or about one-third that of the current Prius. It is also a plug-in hybrid that can run on a mixture of gasoline and ethanol. 
 The problems of changing to a plug-in fleet are not all technical. Anyone without regular access to an outlet -- that would include most apartment dwellers -- would be better off with a conventional Prius rather than a plug-in because the plug-in's larger and heavier battery pack would cut mileage. 
 Toyota is also concerned that plug-in owners might tire of connecting their cars every day. Some answers on consumer expectations and daily performance should come out of evaluations of the prototypes to be conducted at the Irvine and Berkeley campuses of the University of California.
 The uncertainties mean Toyota officials simply won't be pinned down as to when a plug-in hybrid would arrive. When pressed, all Mr. Asakura would say is: ''As quickly as possible.''

HEADLINE: Rethinking How to Teach the New Teachers

BYLINE: By DENISE CARUSO. 
Denise Caruso is executive director of the Hybrid Vigor Institute, which studies collaborative problem-solving. E-mail: dcaruso@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SCHOOL enrollments are increasing year by year, but qualified teachers are leaving the classroom in droves. More than a million veteran teachers are nearing retirement, and more will follow. 
 More than two million new teachers will be needed in the next decade alone, according to the National Education Association, and we should hope that they start lining up soon. 
 Economic research shows that an educated work force is the foundation of a stable economy. A good education does more than just increase a person's earning potential. Studies find that regions that produce well-educated high school graduates have a higher rate of business start-ups and more economic activity. Graduates also provide communities with a continuing pool of taxpaying labor. 
 As teacher rosters shrink, the question is this: How long will such regions be able to hold onto those benefits? 
 The well-known liabilities of teaching -- low pay, overcrowded classrooms and crippling budget constraints -- have led recent graduates to opt for more lucrative career options. 
 And those who are called to the profession despite its shortcomings often find themselves overwhelmed by the enormity of the job. According to many education experts, new teachers feel so ill prepared that a staggering 50 percent of them bolt during their first five years of teaching.
 To help stop the exodus, the Reach Institute for School Leadership, a group based in Napa, Calif., has started an innovative program, designed by and for teachers, that has the potential to transform those first stressful years in the classroom. Reach's newly accredited, two-year teacher credentialing program has a goal of attracting a new generation of committed teachers, mentors and school administrators -- and keeping them for a lifetime.
 In traditional credentialing programs, student teachers spend most of their time taking education courses and seminars. The time they spend in a classroom teaching students is relatively brief -- often just two weeks.
 The Reach program flips this traditional model on its ear. 
 Instead of spending most of their time learning about being a teacher, Reach's students start the program at the front of the classroom from the very first day, with a teacher mentor by their side.
 ''Most new teachers who fail, fail just because they're new,'' said Page Tompkins, the founder and director of Reach. ''When they're struggling with what to do with a problem, they had no one to say, in real time, 'Let me watch you do this.'''
 Before starting Reach, Mr. Tompkins, 37 and a former principal, was a co-founder of the Bay Area School of Enterprise, or BASE, in Alameda, Calif., a public charter high school. BASE is now the lead school for Reach, which is a partnership of eight public charter schools in the San Francisco Bay Area that provide the teachers, mentors, coaches and administrative support for the program. Leslie Medine, a co-founder of BASE and Reach, is also the primary sponsor of Reach through her On the Move organization that trains young leaders. Other financial supporters include the Walter and Elise Haas Fund and the Dean Witter Foundation. 
 Terry Jones, a lecturer and intern coach in the secondary education department at San Francisco State University, finds Reach's model innovative -- and sensible. 
 ''Universities do not do a good job, if they do anything at all, teaching students how to manage a classroom,'' said Dr. Jones, a teacher training expert who is an unpaid adviser to Reach. ''With Reach, young teachers go into the classroom, have experiences, then come to a seminar where their coach can add theory to what they're learning first hand. It's exactly the opposite of the way it's done now.'' 
 Teachers in the Reach program are also part of a ''cohort'' or team of 10 or 12 students who spend the entire two years of the program together. 
 Each of the 30 students who are in Reach's inaugural class meet with the cohort for three hours a week. ''Being a new teacher is lonely work,'' Mr. Tompkins said. ''There are days when all of us say, 'I don't want to do this anymore.' But in a cohort, I know people are counting on me to show up.''
 ACADEMIC research seems to support Reach's approach. Teachers from six Georgia school districts, surveyed for a study published in the May 2005 issue of Educational Leadership, said the most effective strategies for helping new teachers were giving them the opportunity to observe other teachers, work with mentors, meet and make plans with other teachers and receive plenty of feedback. 
 Likewise, a study of existing alternative certification programs (not including Reach), to be published in 2008 in Teachers College Record, suggests that effective programs include a collegial atmosphere and ''trained mentors who have the time and resources to plan lessons with candidates.'' 
 Another important factor, the report states, is that new teachers are trained ''in schools with strong leadership.'' According to Mr. Tompkins, Reach has ''networked'' all eight school principals into active program participation, is developing a ''mentor coaching academy'' for experienced teachers and a master's degree program. 
 ''I want to be sure that we have a place for them when they want to take more responsibilities and go into administration,'' said Dennis Chaconas, a 35-year veteran of public education reform who works with the school principals and is helping to develop the mentor and master's programs. Thus, training new administrators and coaches is ''the next step'' for Reach, he said. ''Good principals and good programs make and keep great teachers.''

HEADLINE: Urban, Hip Place With Locally Grown Focus

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE LYNESS

 BODY:
I LIKE to give a new restaurant several months to establish itself before reviewing it, but sometimes the buzz on a place is such that it's hard to wait. Firebox, named for the metal fuel box in the engine of a steam locomotive, opened in Hartford on June 1 and I was there shortly after, my curiosity aroused by the community-conscious entrepreneurship that the restaurant was spearheading. 
 The Melville Charitable Trust is a national philanthropic organization, based in Hartford, whose mission is to fight homelessness. In 2005, the trust bought Billings Forge, a late-19th-century red brick factory complex in the Frog Hollow neighborhood of Hartford, down the block from the State Capitol. Originally built to manufacture precision tools, the complex was converted to low-income housing during the 1970s. The neighborhood slid into hard times. By 2005, many of the residents of Billings Forge were out of work, with little hope of employment. 
 Since then, the trust has been busy. Taking an integrative approach, it is working with the residents to redevelop the Forge and the neighborhood on several fronts. The aging physical site is being rehabilitated. A community center has been established to give residents and members of the surrounding community a hand up. It offers educational programs for adults and after-school programs for youngsters that teach computer skills, science, photography and nutrition and cooking, among other things.
 In a bid to bring money into the neighborhood, the trust opened Firebox in the brick building on Broad Street that used to house the now-defunct Mamacita's. One-third of the Firebox staff is drawn from the neighborhood, some from Billings Forge. 
 The restaurant has a nice urban-hip feel, with its handsome brick structure, exposed beams and unusual burnt orange-colored bar, illuminated from underneath. A gas fireplace is set in one wall of the main dining room; a wine rack covers the entire expanse of the facing wall. 
 A comfortable marriage of elegance and neighborhood is achieved with bare tables and friendly waiters clothed in pants, button-down shirts and Paris-brasserie-length blue-and-white striped aprons. 
 The trust's focus on nurturing the community is reflected in a menu built around locally produced foodstuffs, some of which are bought at the Farmers' Market, funded by the Trust, that opened this summer in the parking lot next door. And Jason Collin, the chef, is developing a reputation as an advocate of sustainable, locally grown ingredients.
 At my first meal at Firebox (a mere eight weeks after opening), Mr. Collin's hearty, contemporary American style was emerging, but the food was uneven. Seasoning was off, with the result that the food was often flat. Some meats were overcooked. 
 The goat-cheese deviled eggs that garnished a spinach, frisee and bacon salad were underseasoned, and the pierogis, filled with generous chunks of lobster, needed salt and pepper as a counterpoint to the rich creme fraiche and applesauce garnish.
 A corn and shrimp risotto lacked a bass note to balance the sweetness of corn and shrimp, and the texture was more compact than creamy. Panko-crusted scallops were perfectly cooked. Still, I longed for a sharp edge to offset the sweet, creamy, curried fennel sauce, and mild-tasting Israeli couscous.
 Mr. Collin has since resolved these early glitches, and judging from my last visit, appears to be hitting his stride. At a meal I had there a couple of weeks ago, the food was not only well seasoned, it was also precise and nourishing: American farm table meets brasserie. 
 Appetizer mussels were a tiny bit overcooked, but the glossy, basil-scented butter sauce made up for it. A thick slice of country-style pork pate was well seasoned, and coarse-textured. 
 Honey-black-pepper roasted chicken was gorgeous in its honey-brown crust, and Stonington flounder fillets, barely baked to preserve texture and delicate flavor, were draped over a bed of buttered chopped fennel and leeks, and finished with a tomato-based lobster sauce.
 The meal ended with a vanilla panna cotta, light enough to melt on the tongue, and a dense chocolate terrine, composed of three layers -- white, dark and milk. 
 There is something appealing about the idea of using food and cooking to nourish a new community. Firebox is a comfortable meeting place for this venture. Though stylish, it is neither elitist nor terribly expensive. 
 And according to Bob Hohler, executive director of the Melville Charitable Trust, the farmers' market that helps supply the restaurant has been so successful that it is likely to be open more than one day a week next year.
 Although the trust has never done anything quite like this before, Mr. Hohler, who is also a founder of the Boston Center for the Arts, has seen how a neighborhood revival can be sparked by the ''invasion'' of a few successful restaurants.
 ''I saw how Boston's South End changed from a red-lined district where you couldn't get a mortgage to a district that is now hugely successful, both from an economic and cultural standpoint,'' he said. ''The cutting edge of that change was the establishment of a couple of restaurant beachheads. Very quickly other restaurants were attracted to the area. We saw how that worked, and we're hoping that that'll happen here.'' 
 Given what I've seen, and eaten, that seems entirely possible.

HEADLINE: College Towns Escape the Pain

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
As the inner cities, along with much of Florida and the interior of California, face the prospect of a foreclosure meltdown, American college towns appear to be islands of stability. 
 The list of metropolitan areas with the smallest percentage of high-cost home loans is dominated by small cities with big colleges, including Ithaca, N.Y.; Iowa City; Madison, Wis.; Morgantown, W.V.; and State College, Pa. 
 Is it because their educated residents were so much smarter than the rest of us, and foresaw the folly? Is it because baby boomers, coughing up tuition for their children, are enriching those economies -- with dollars often borrowed on refinanced houses back home? Or is it because aging boomers themselves are relocating with big down payments in hand and retirement in mind?
 It could be all of that and more, say economists and academics. But ultimately, what the cities on the list have in larger measure than much of the rest of the country is stability, in both their housing and job markets.
 ''Those housing markets are not superheated,'' said Bruce Katz, director of metropolitan policy at the Brookings Institution. ''And salaries are pretty good for faculty and research assistants. So wages and housing prices are more in sync than in the rest of the country.''
 The subprime-lending crisis is in one sense simply the barometer of how far home prices have outstripped incomes. As homes became harder to afford, financing became more creative, and expensive. Irrational exuberance ensued, along with predation.
 ''Where subprimes are turning up is in hot markets, but also in places like Cleveland and Detroit,'' Mr. Katz said. ''College towns are more stable places in some respects. If you make between $75,000 and $125,000 in these places, you can get into a pretty decent home and still have very reasonable ratios.''
 Contributing to reasonable home prices is the fact that many places on the list are economic oases, surrounded by areas where jobs are dwindling, which helps depress housing demand. Yet the college towns themselves are thriving: The peak years for American births since the baby boom were 1989 to 1993, and college enrollments are swelling as never before. Many communities on the list also have big medical centers or flourishing research operations.
 ''There's so much construction at Cornell,'' said Richard L. Patterson, the general manager of Audrey Edelman RealtyUSA in Ithaca.
 Lending tends to be dominated by the local bank rather than mortgage companies. In Iowa City, Hills Bank and Trust made 30 percent of the mortgages on one- to four-family homes in 2006. In Ithaca, Tompkins Trust Company and the Cornell University credit union lead the list of lenders.
 ''We're like what middle-class America used to be,'' said Barbara Alexander, a real estate agent in Morgantown, home of West Virginia University. ''We're insulated from what happens in other places, and the lenders and buyers are more conservative. I can't remember the last time we had a recession in Morgantown.''
 Some experts say the explanation is largely cultural.
 ''Professors and other educated residents in these heartland college towns are conservative when it comes to money and investments,'' said William Frey, a demographer at Brookings. ''They spend their time worrying about ideas, publishing and 'the greater good.' ''

HEADLINE: A Tale of Independence

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

DATELINE: RIGA, Latvia 

 BODY:
Like the coliseums of ancient Rome, Daugava Stadium here in Latvia's capital is a decaying monument to a fallen athletic superpower. Once a monument to Soviet sporting prowess, the bulky structure is now a crumbling reminder of past glory.
 Arriving at the stadium in her BMW sport utility vehicle recently for a 10-kilometer race, Jelena Prokopcuka, the two-time defending champion of the New York City Marathon, apologized for the facility's condition. The once-proud sports programs of Latvia, a tiny country wedged between Russia and the Baltic Sea, fell into disarray with the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991.
 Prokopcuka was one of the first, and still among the few, Latvian athletes to emerge from the wreckage. When she surged out of obscurity to win the 2005 New York City Marathon, it was considered a fluke. She was a relatively inexperienced and near-unknown marathoner, running in a field without many of the big-name stars -- a stand-in expected to return shortly to anonymity.
 She then won in 2006 and will vie to become only the second woman to win the world's largest marathon three years in a row. [The professional women's race will start Sunday morning at 9:35 Eastern.] 
 ''After the second win, people were convinced that she was something,'' said Aleksandr Prokopcuks, her husband and trainer.
 Over tea and watermelon at her home in Jurmala, a resort town that is 30 minutes from Riga, Prokopcuka (pronounced pro-kop-CHU-ka) said that success had made her into a kind of brand for Latvia.
 ''After my victory in New York, I think that even some Americans, if only a small percentage, learned that there was such a country,'' she said.
 Before that, she said, when she mentioned Latvia, many asked, ''Is that in Africa or something?'' 
 Prokopcuka, 31, began training at Riga's stadium 20 years ago, though as a girl she showed little promise of distinguishing herself, said Leonid Strekalovsky, her coach since she was 11. 
 ''I would say she was one of the worst; she was weak,'' he said. 
 Seated on an old wooden weight bench in the stadium's dank basement gym, Strekalovsky described how one day, while leading a group of gangly teenagers on a 3-kilometer run, he glanced back and was surprised to see Prokopcuka right behind him. 
 ''Of course I didn't tell her at that time, but I immediately thought that if she had made it this far, then there was already something there.'' 
 Today, Prokopcuka is recognized as one of the top distance runners in the world, a gritty competitor with an air of grace, known as much for toughness as for a sense of style.
 ''She's sort of a champion's champion, an iron fist with a silk glove,'' said Mary Wittenberg, the director of the New York City Marathon.
 Prokopcuka won her first marathon in 2005 in Osaka, Japan, logging a personal best of 2 hours 22 minutes 56 seconds. In addition to her victories in New York, she was second in the Boston Marathon for the past two years and has been successful running shorter distances. 
 Her race to the top of this grueling, though often inconspicuous sport has mirrored and perhaps even aided her country's difficult transformation. It gained independence in 1991, changing from a Soviet vassal to a burgeoning democracy of about two million people on the eastern edge of the European Union. 
 When Latvia was pushing for NATO membership, Prokopcuka joined the army in 1999, racing in competitions to boost the military's international prestige. She earned the rank of corporal and won two medals in cross-country races. ''This was a means of existence and provided the possibility to continue my professional activities,'' she said. 
 She comes from a generation of post-Soviet athletes who are products, not of the doting tutelage of the state, but of the economic and social tumult that followed. Though independence freed Prokopcuka to compete internationally, as it did many other former Soviet athletes, it also signaled the end of heavy government funding for athletics, Prokopcuka said, creating a generation of ''sports fanatics'' forced to train in poor conditions, many without income. 
 ''Everything I have done, I have done myself with the help of my husband,'' she said. ''If you look behind me, no one is standing there.'' 
 A Nike sponsorship and prize money for victory now supplements her military wages. A victory in New York this year will also give her the World Marathon Majors championship, a points-based professional series created in 2006, and the $500,000 purse that goes with it.
 ''Just from seeing Jelena run, and knowing that she has saved herself for the big races, I think her chances are very good,'' said Grete Waitz, a nine-time New York City Marathon winner, by telephone from her home in Oslo. In 1980, she became the first woman to win in New York three times in succession. 
 ''I hope she will have a great success in the marathon,'' she said. ''I'm going to be there too, so I'm going to cheer for her.''
 Joining Prokopcuka for the 26.2-mile race through New York's five boroughs toward victory at Central Park's Tavern on the Green will be the marathoning luminaries Lidiya Grigoryeva of Russia, who edged out Prokopcuka to win the 2007 Boston Marathon, and Catherine Ndereba of Kenya, the third-place finisher at last year's New York City Marathon. 
 ''The biggest challenge for Jelena in this year's race will be that all the pressure will be on her,'' Wittenberg said. ''She has lost the element of surprise; she is now one to chase.''
 Prokopcuka will also be facing one of her role models, Paula Radcliffe, the 2004 winner from England, who unexpectedly announced her entry into the race after a two-year hiatus. 
 ''This is a stronger field than normal for a big-city marathon,'' Radcliffe said by telephone from Ireland, adding that she respected Prokopcuka as a competitor and for her ''nice flowing style.'' 
 ''But when I'm in the race, I'll do everything I can to beat her,'' she said. 
 Seven time zones away from New York, Prokopcuka is immersed in her training. She spends days running along the beach or through the forests near her home on the Baltic Sea, occasionally stopping to gather mushrooms, which she brings home for soup. 
 At the 10-kilometer race in Riga, Prokopcuka was unchallenged. Wearing a sleek Nike uniform, sunglasses and gold earrings, she lapped many of her male competitors, who struggled against a fierce Baltic wind in shabby, ill-fitting tracksuits. 
 Most did not seem to mind.
 She has become a role model for Latvia's small running community and has gained a fair degree of renown, especially among the large Russian minority of which she is a part. 
 ''In our country, our sport is considered something of a miracle,'' she said in her native Russian, explaining that because Latvia is so small, many in the country have considered high athletic achievements to be unattainable. 
 Until now.
 ''When I won, many discovered that it was finally possible,'' she said.

 BODY:
MANY colleges say their mission is to mold young minds, but a few take it to the next level. They have a particular philosophy about how life should be lived or knowledge absorbed, and they want to make sure their students are not just reading about it or dabbling in it. They want their students to live it, day in and day out, for four years. Sound intense? It is. A bit offbeat? That too. Such colleges are not for everyone, nor do they want to be. 
 Eco-colleges, for instance, wrap the curriculum in ideas about environmental stewardship. A deep conviction about the importance of classic literature permeates every course of a great-books college. Experiential-learning colleges take pains to give students daily hands-on knowledge of what it is like to build a company, deal with workplace problems or manage a farm. 
 The names of these colleges are not readily recognized by employers, and students can be pigeonholed -- crunchy-granola, flaky, intellectual. But for a particular student, often a self-starter or one compelled to do things differently, a small niche college can feel like a perfect fit. 
 ''Innovative schools can serve as an incubator for certain types of students who then go on and have powerful lives because their approach to the world was respected, encouraged and allowed,'' says Donald Asher, author of ''Cool Colleges for the Hyper-Intelligent, Self-Directed, Late-Blooming and Just Plain Different.'' ''Most parents today simply want to know, 'Is this college going to help my student's career?' and their question is profoundly limited in its insight.''
 On his list of most innovative colleges are Deep Springs, a two-year college/ranch for two dozen men in remote Nevada; Bard College at Simon's Rock, which plucks scholarly students out of high school early, and Olin College of Engineering, for ''super-nerdy eggheads, and it's free.''
 The 13 liberal arts institutions in the Consortium for Innovative Environments in Learning don't follow conventional approaches, either. ''The aim is for a highly transformative experience,'' says Karen Spear, its executive director. 
 Its ranks include Marlboro College, which sits on a hilltop in Vermont. Its 330 students are expected to participate in governing the institution through monthly ''town meetings'' in the dining hall and must also demonstrate good writing skills in a third-term portfolio (they will be asked to withdraw if the faculty finds it lacking). 
 Another is Prescott in Arizona, which has about 500 resident students and requires all new ones to go through a ''wilderness orientation'' of backcountry camping for three weeks. 
 Students at Warren Wilson College, set against the Blue Ridge Mountains near Asheville, N.C., adhere to ''the triad'' of academics, work and service. To graduate, they must log 100 hours of community service while also working 15 hours a week on a ''crew'' that helps keep the school running. The campus holds 870 undergraduates, strives for environmental sustainability and features a working 300-acre farm. Student jobs range from Web site maintenance to mountain-bike repair to cow-milking. The experience of being responsible for the efficient operation of the school is core to the educational mission, says Ian Robertson, dean of work at Warren Wilson. ''We really do have to get the light bulb screwed in,'' he says. ''We can't just sit around and talk about it.'' Job supervisors, he says, see their students every day and stay in close contact with professors about their growth.
 With such small enrollments, individualized attention is a hallmark of the niche college. Professors and other mentors can be nearly evangelical in their drive to put each student on a purposeful life path. 
 Being small and different comes with risk, too. Administrators are sensitive to the fate of Antioch College, a small liberal-arts school in Ohio known for its alternative lifestyles and student-driven education. It ran out of money and announced it would close in July. ''Sometimes radicalness, if it leads to unsustainable economic outcomes, means you can't continue,'' says Larry D. Shinn, president of Berea College, a liberal arts school of 1,500 in Appalachian Kentucky, which does not charge tuition. ''We have to be careful in thinking about, What does it mean to have a truly different institution?'' 
 Berea admits only students from families in the lower 30 percent by income, and it requires every student to work at least 10 hours a week. Financial stability, Dr. Shinn says, comes from a strong endowment, something missing at Antioch. 
 Warren Wilson leaders decided several years ago to double enrollment to around 800, partly as a matter of survival. Small colleges often must rely on high tuition to stay afloat. Warren Wilson's tuition, room and board officially come to $28,000, minus some $3,000 in ''pay'' to each student worker. 
 Advocates say that kindling passion is what makes the schools work. Dropouts aren't unheard of, but exit surveys by some of the colleges show that many graduates feel driven, full of purpose and, in large part, changed. You might say the schools' philosophies have gotten into their blood.
 ''Don't limit yourself by what you think you want to become,'' Dr. Shinn advises prospective students. ''Be open to the future. When you do that, it's not just about going to schools that are different. It's going to schools that will challenge you to be different.''

HEADLINE: What's Behind The Race Gap?

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ and FORD FESSENDEN

 BODY:
High-cost subprime mortgages have often been framed as loans that catered to people with blemished credit records or little experience with debt.
 There has been less attention paid to the concentration of these loans in neighborhoods that are largely black, Hispanic, or both. This pattern, documented in federal loan records, holds true even when comparing white middle-income or upper-income neighborhoods with similar minority ones. 
 Consider two neighborhoods in the Detroit area. One, located in the working-class suburb of Plymouth, is 97 percent white with a median income of $51,000 in 2000. To the east, a census tract in Detroit just inside Eight Mile Road has a very similar median income, $49,000, but the population there is 97 percent black. 
 Last year, about 70 percent of the loans made in the Detroit neighborhood carried a high interest rate -- defined as 3 percentage points more than the yield on a comparable Treasury note -- while in Plymouth just 17 percent did.
 Last year, blacks were 2.3 times more likely, and Hispanics twice as likely, to get high-cost loans as whites after adjusting for loan amounts and the income of the borrowers, according to an analysis of loans reported under the federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. (Asians are somewhat less likely than whites to take out high-cost loans.)
 Researchers and industry officials agree that there is probably no single explanation for the lending patterns, though the history of banks' avoiding minority neighborhoods, the practice known as ''redlining,'' is a good place to start. (Experts have to resort to guesswork because the government does not require lenders to report information about borrowers' credit scores, down payments and other details used in pricing loans.)
 Lenders say that in general higher rates are justified to account for the bigger risks posed by borrowers who have a poor record at paying bills on time and defaulting on debts. And a recent Federal Reserve study noted that neighborhoods where people tend to have lower credit scores also tend to a greater concentration of high-cost loans. 
 The study suggests that the concentration of high-cost loans is not caused by an area's racial makeup, though there is a correlation, said Jay Brinkmann, vice president for research and economics at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
 But the Fed study also suggests that a big part of the reason may have to do with the lenders that minority borrowers do business with. The biggest home lenders in minority neighborhoods are mortgage companies that provide only subprime loans, not full-service banks that do a range of lending.
 It may be that these borrowers do not have access to traditional banks, because there are no branches near them. The Community Reinvestment Act, enacted 30 years ago, was intended to address redlining by forcing banks to make loans in lower-income areas. But the law's provisions do not apply to banks in neighborhoods where they have no branches. 
 ''You could go into a middle-class area in Queens County that is white and there will be lots of banks on the shopping street,'' said Alfred A. DelliBovi, president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and a deputy secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in the first Bush administration. ''If you go to an area that is equal income and that is black, you won't see many.''
 Banks typically locate branches where they believe they will get the most deposits. A lower savings rate and a distrust of banks stemming from a legacy of redlining may help explain why there are fewer branches in minority neighborhoods, Mr. DelliBovi said.
 A bigger reason may be that in recent years many subprime loans were not sought out by borrowers but actively sold to them by brokers and telemarketers, said Calvin Bradford, a housing researcher and consultant. A majority of the loans were refinance transactions allowing homeowners to take cash out of their appreciating property or pay off credit card and other debt. 
 Lenders made the risky loans, then often sold them to Wall Street investors. Many borrowers appear to have been swayed by brokers and lenders offering to look out for their best interests even when they had no obligation to do so.
 ''If we turn the clock back 30 years ago, we had redlining,'' said Nicholas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. ''In the last few years, we have had the opposite -- an overextension of credit by lenders and an overextension by borrowers.''
 The country needs to find a balance, ''a way to extend credit at a reasonable cost to people with impaired credit,'' he said. The government, through programs like the Federal Housing Administration and the big mortgage purchasers Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, must play a critical role, Mr. Retsinas said, adding that he worries that the efforts initiated so far are not robust enough.
 ''There are lots of people trying to do the right thing,'' he said. ''But at this time I'm not very sanguine that we will deal with this in a concerted manner.''

HEADLINE: No Exit

BYLINE: By MONTY NEILL and LISA GUISBOND. 
Monty Neill is the co-executive director and Lisa Guisbond is the testing reform analyst at the National Center for Fair and Open Testing.

DATELINE: Cambridge, Mass. 

 BODY:
 THE Connecticut State Board of Education is considering some form of exit exams as a graduation requirement from high school. The board is likely to make its recommendations to the Legislature by the end of the year. 
 Connecticut should think twice before going down this road. Evidence shows ''high stakes'' tests like exit exams that determine whether a student can graduate, are the wrong prescription for what ails public education.
 The ills of many public schools are undeniable. Like other states, Connecticut has vast disparities in educational access, quality and outcomes. The record demonstrates, however, that exit exams are a false solution for these problems. Graduation tests that deny diplomas are simply another way to punish the victims of inadequately financed education. The victims are disproportionately low-income and minority students, some of them learning-disabled or immigrants for whom English is not the first language. 
 Proponents of graduation tests ignore the real consequences. Like snake-oil salesmen, they promise miracle cures. In reality, the harmful side effects of exit exams include a curriculum narrowed to a few subjects, teaching reduced to little more than test preparation, increased dropout rates and demoralized students. 
 Exit exam promoters promise narrowed achievement gaps and overall score increases. But that has not happened. While the number of states with graduation tests has steadily risen over the last two decades, results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the benchmark federal test that is administered every year, show no narrowing of the achievement gap among racial groups at the high school level. Nor have average reading scores increased.
 A major reason for the lack of progress is that high-stakes testing, whether state-mandated graduation exams or the federal No Child Left Behind law, flies in the face of real learning. Untested subjects are ignored, while tested topics turn into test-coaching programs. Test prep is like holding a match to a thermostat and believing the room will get warmer: scores may rise on that test, but learning does not. 
 What's more, high-stakes testing reduces the high school graduation rate. Texas introduced exit exams in 1992. Fifteen years later, a record 40,200 students in the class of 2007 were denied diplomas based on the state tests. National independent research confirms a link between graduation tests and higher dropout rates. 
 In 2006, Boston's annual dropout rate rose sharply to 9.9 percent from 7.7 percent. At the same time, the city suffered a wave of youth violence. Boston City Council members, who solicited the views of local young people on why violence was rising, reported ''frustration and boredom with the endless drilling and practice'' for the state comprehensive assessment exams, which students in grades 3 through 10 are required to take. 
 Unable to produce evidence of real success, exit exam supporters say we're not doing these students any favors if we just give them a diploma. But what is gained if students have nothing to show after playing by the rules and passing required courses for 12 years of schooling? Students without diplomas earn much less money, are less likely to maintain stable families and are far more likely to end up in prison. Denying a diploma based on a test score does neither student nor society any favors. 
 If exit exams really enhance equity and school quality, why are Southern states -- the first to adopt graduation tests -- still mired at the bottom by any measure of educational performance? Why, in short, should Connecticut follow the failed practices of Mississippi and Alabama? 
 The truth is that race and class performance gaps reflect more on what happens outside the classroom than inside. A recent analysis of high school test scores in Connecticut found socioeconomic factors alone account for about 85 percent of the variation in test scores in four subjects. Connecticut can do better than putting accountability on the backs of its children while failing to address the underlying economic and social inequalities. 
 The choice is not between imposing graduation tests and doing nothing to improve education. Solving the problem of unequal schools and inadequate outcomes requires many actions, from ensuring financial equity for the Bridgeports and Hartfords to better K-12 programs to having expectations of a well-rounded education for all children. 
 Connecticut must reorder its priorities and pursue public policies that address the foundations of children's academic success: health care, nutrition and living wages for working parents, along with high-quality teachers, a strong curriculum and well-financed schools.

HEADLINE: Newark Arena's Economic Impact Unclear

BYLINE: By JENNIFER V. HUGHES

DATELINE: NEWARK 

 BODY:
 RICK ECKSTEIN has heard it before. 
 ''They're saying: 'It's going to rejuvenate the area!' 'This will be the key to revitalizing the city!''' Dr. Eckstein, a sociology professor at Villanova University and an expert on sports stadiums, said about the new Prudential Center arena here. ''The problem is that the arguments don't fly.'' 
 The arena, built in hopes of revitalizing downtown Newark, opened Oct. 25, with six Bon Jovi concerts and three Devils hockey games scheduled in its first 10 days. Its initial attractions drew large crowds, a big police presence and extra train service, and city officials say the center is only one piece of their development plan. 
 But Dr. Eckstein was less optimistic about the arena's prospects as an economic engine. He said the situation in Newark was similar to what he found looking at two dozen baseball and football stadiums over 10 years for the book ''Public Dollars, Private Stadiums'' (Rutgers University Press, 2003), which he co-wrote.
 ''It really hasn't played out favorably in many cities,'' he said.
 Dr. Eckstein is not the only skeptic. 
 ''I have not been able to find any evidence that stadiums and arenas are an important engine of local economic growth,'' said Brad R. Humphreys, associate professor of economics at the University of Alberta, who studied the economic impact of major league baseball, football and basketball teams in 37 cities over 30 years. He looked at salaries and the number of jobs in the area before and after a stadium's arrival.
 A new or revamped stadium can produce some benefit, Dr. Humphrey, if the project is integrated with things like residential housing and retail stores and coordinated into ''a complete local redevelopment plan.''
 Newark officials insist that they do have a holistic plan.
 Stefan Pryor, deputy mayor for economic development, said, ''The arena unto itself cannot a transformation make.'' He said several factors would aid the plan. 
 Two developers are close to signing deals to bring hotels to the area, and Mayor Cory A. Booker wants to ensure that the jobs there are filled by local union members. The city is changing zoning laws to make it easier for developers to turn abandoned commercial property into residential units. 
 The arena is in the heart of downtown and is two blocks from a rail hub, Pennsylvania Station. The area's proximity to the seaport and major highways is also an advantage, Mr. Pryor said. 
 Additionally, the city is spending $17 million for a larger project on streetscape improvements in the areas of Broad and Market Streets. It also has $13 million from land sales that it plans to use to lure businesses and make loans to existing or relocating small, minority-owned companies. And one small development -- a restaurant and six apartments, near the arena on Edison Place -- will most likely open early next year, Mr. Pryor said. 
 Combining all those factors, ''there is a real reason for optimism,'' he said. 
 In many ways, the opening of the $375 million arena appears to have been a success. More than 80,000 people came for the first four days of Bon Jovi concerts and a Devils game. New Jersey Transit added trains to downtown, and 3,000 to 4,000 people took the train to arena events each night. 
 Transportation experts had predicted that about 75 percent of arenagoers would take cars, but only 60 percent did, making the drive easier.
 But ask business owners and residents whether they think the arena is beneficial, and their opinions are mixed. 
 ''This is so good for the city,'' said Mike Megalla of Steak House 1 Giant Pizzas and Subs, near the back of the arena on Broad Street, on Saturday night. 
 ''Broad Street has never been so clean, and business is booming,'' he said. Mr. Megalla does about $1,500 in sales on an average Saturday, he said, but before 9 p.m. was already at $2,700.
 A few doors down on Broad Street, Kathy Nguyen doubted that arena-goers would help her salon, ViVi Nails and Hair, while a customer, Erica Love, had questions about the cleaned-up streets and increased police presence. 
 ''All this new stuff -- why did it take an arena to do it?'' Ms. Love asked. ''They're not going to have anything at that arena that people who live in Newark are going to go to, can afford to go to.''
 Ms. Nguyen said she knew someone who got an arena job but not full-time employment. 
 Dr. Humphreys said that was typical of stadium and arena work. He also found that arena patrons often just shifted spending from one part of a region to another: People may see Bon Jovi in Newark, he said, instead of bowling in Secaucus.
 The city kicked in $210 million to finance the arena with money from a 2002 settlement with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Mayor Booker initially opposed the arena plan but backed it when he realized he could not undo the deal signed by his predecessor, Sharpe James. 
 Dr. Eckstein, the author, said other cities with new arenas had faced additional issues. Money from parking taxes, for instance, may diminish if officials also urge people to take mass transit.
 Dr. Eckstein also noted that cities often incur big expenses for arena security. The Newark Police Department has budgeted $20,000 to $25,000 for overtime for every sold-out arena event. It moved about 30 officers from other precincts to cover the arena and shifted the schedules of about 50 others to make them available at event times, Deputy Chief Daniel Zieser said. 
 On the other hand, Dr. Eckstein said some things are in Newark's favor.
 ''When it is a new arena, you are going to get more of a bang because you're not just replacing one thing with another,'' he said. ''Will it balance with the costs? I guess you're going to have to see.''

HEADLINE: A semester in Ghana: $4,725. A year in Beijing: $35,150. Experience abroad: Priceless?

BYLINE: By LAURA PAPPANO

 BODY:
In many parts of the world, college is cheap. 
 An international student enrolling at the University of Bologna in Italy pays $1,740 a year in tuition and fees (at $1.42 to the euro). Through Indiana University, enrollees who are not part of a direct exchange (about half of participants) pay an academic fee of $20,200. 
 At Peking University in Beijing, ''tuition'' for a year under the auspices of Boston College comes to $35,150. The published rate for international students is $3,420 (at 13 cents to the yuan).
 Program organizers are quick to tick off support services that make up a big part of the cost difference: cultural outings, security briefings, orientation programs, on-site staff to help get credits transmitted and sort out visa problems. Will someone translate at the doctor's office? Is there a driver? 
 How much hand-holding and service students want is an individual matter. If you don't need much, can study abroad be done for less? Absolutely.
 FINANCIAL AID: DON'T LEAVE HOME WITHOUT IT
 For most students, financial aid is the biggest factor in affording study abroad. Government grants and loans can usually travel with a student, but colleges are less generous with the aid from their own coffers. 
 According to an October study of about 100 institutions and study-abroad organizations by the Forum on Education Abroad, an association of program providers and colleges based at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., 74 percent of colleges let students apply need-based institutional aid to programs they run themselves; 61 percent to approved programs operated by others. For example, Goucher College, which requires its students to study abroad, withholds institutional aid if a student chooses a program it doesn't run. (Students do get a $1,200 voucher no matter what.) 
 The practice encourages students to choose programs that are run or supported by their college. So does the widespread requirement that students pay their college's regular tuition and fees, even if the program's price tag is far less. Only 35 percent of colleges let students pay a program provider directly, according to the forum study.
 Brown put the policy into effect last year: if you want credit from Brown, you pay Brown tuition. The idea is that the cost to students is the same, whether they are in Paris or Delhi or Providence, R.I. But living expenses, including room and board, are not. Those come to an estimated $10,200 for a semester in Paris and $5,400 in India. Room and board for a semester at Brown costs $4,800.
 For students covering their own food and housing expenses, the sinking dollar has hurt. Boston University estimates $10,500 in personal expenses for its yearlong program at Keio University in Tokyo, for a total of $57,844 when housing, airfare and other expenditures are added. Several students interviewed say the living expenses they budgeted for were off -- in some cases by thousands of dollars -- leaving them to radically economize, ask parents to send money, or draw down bank accounts.
 Alexandria Hollett, an Indiana University senior who studied last year in Bologna, says that with room and board, she spent about $6,000 more than she had anticipated, or about $28,000. Today, she says, ''I am working two jobs as well as being a full-time student because I have no money.''
 Rick Vaz, dean of interdisciplinary and global studies at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts, says the weakening dollar has made cost ''a significant barrier'' for some of his students. On top of regular tuition and fees of $34,830, W.P.I. charges about $3,500 to $7,500, depending on the destination, to cover housing, board and airfare for a seven-week program. Mr. Vaz plans to make financial aid for study abroad a big focus of a coming fund-raising campaign.
 ONE WAY TO SAVE: SEAT FOR SEAT
 Exchange agreements, which allow students at an American university and at a foreign university to literally trade places, tend to be cheaper, because colleges aren't sacrificing a tuition-paying student for the semester. Participants in Indiana's Bologna program who are part of an exchange -- luckily -- pay $8,450 a year if they are state residents and $16,900 otherwise, a saving of about $12,000 or $3,000 on Indiana's standard academic fee. For its exchange program with the University of Ghana, state residents will pay $4,725 and nonresidents $9,450 to cover tuition, orientation and health insurance for the 2008 spring semester (cheapest route: international students enrolling on their own pay $1,750 a semester).
 On a broader scale, the International Student Exchange Program, a group of 275 colleges in 39 countries, lets students pay room and board at home and essentially switch with students abroad; 2,400 students did this during the 2006-7 academic year. 
 George Dennison, past chairman of the program and president of the University of Montana, says that while host schools don't offer cultural outings or special programs, a staff member does make sure students register for classes and find housing. 
 The point, he says, is to let them live on their own in the different cultural milieu, because that's how they will learn the most.
 COURSE CREDIT: OVERSEAS PROTECTIONISM?
 Brian J. Whalen, president of the Forum on Education Abroad and executive director of the Office of Global Education at Dickinson College, says colleges don't want to give credit for programs that compete with their own -- 36 percent never do, and 39 percent only sometimes do, according to his group's findings. If students want to go to Paris on a non-Dickinson program, he says, ''They better have a pretty good reason, because we run our own program in France and we want to protect our program.''
 When going outside a college's offerings, get an O.K. in advance. Stephanie Brockman, who majors in Arabic and Islamic studies at Yale, wanted to study in Oman on a program run by the nonprofit SIT Study Abroad that was not sanctioned by Yale. Ms. Brockman credits an ''epic e-mail'' endorsement from a professor for sealing the approval she needed.
 Carl Good, director of undergraduate studies in Spanish at Indiana University Bloomington, says that too many students don't take preapproval seriously. ''What's happening,'' he says, ''is a lot of students are finding their own study-abroad programs, and they come back without having spoken to anyone at the university.'' A third of the study-abroad courses he reviews for credit in the Spanish department are from returnees who hadn't gotten approval in advance. On average, he awards two courses' worth of credit for a semester in Spanish-language countries, so rogue study-abroaders must ''shop around'' in other departments for credit based on the course content. (Be sure to keep the syllabus and academic work to show what you've done.)
 Getting credit toward general education requirements is easier than getting credits in advanced courses toward a major, even in college-approved programs. Kevin LeShane, a University of Connecticut senior with a dual major in journalism and physiology/neurobiology, says that by the time he applied and was accepted into the university's Florence program in spring 2006, he had finished his general education requirements. That meant no study-abroad credits could count toward graduation. He couldn't justify going. 
 ''I was disappointed,'' he says. ''I definitely would have done it if I'd thought about it freshman year.''
 The takeaway message is to plan early, at least a year in advance and maybe more, depending on your major.
 D.I.Y.
 How to tell a well-thought-out program from one with a well-designed Web presence but little substance? The Forum on Education Abroad is staking out some guideposts. In May, the organization articulated standards of good practice, and it is in the midst of reviewing offerings of 12 campuses and program providers, on matters from safety to help for students in transferring credits. ''It's akin to an accreditation process,'' says Mr. Whalen. He expects results of the review to be out by spring, and that those winning forum approval will advertise that fact.
 Generations of students have decided to forgo prepackaged programs altogether and have left their American institutions to enroll in foreign ones on their own. Some colleges allow a leave of absence and accept the transfer of some credits. At New York University, about 70 of the 2,000 students who go abroad on semester programs do it that way, according to Yaw Nyarko, its vice provost for globalization and multicultural affairs.
 The risk of going it alone, of course, is the possibility of forfeiting financial aid and course credit. Further, you have to get your own visa, register for courses (and know which ones to take) and get foreign universities, some of them notoriously lax, to send back the transcripts. Since academic calendars don't necessarily align, you could miss the start of your next semester, too.
 Carl A. Herrin, a study-abroad consultant and lobbyist in Maryland, says students who can do it on their own are rare. ''You would pick them out in a group of their peers for their independence, self-discipline and planning,'' he says. ''They have a real clear vision of what they want to do.''

HEADLINE: Telltale Art

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
A GIANT, gleaming blue diamond -- about eight feet tall by seven feet wide -- is parked on four gold-colored prongs outside Christie's at Rockefeller Center. Just uptown Christie's archrival, Sotheby's, has another sight gag, an eye-catching confection of similar dimensions: a shiny, bright-red dangling heart. These playful if expensive sculptures by the artist Jeff Koons could be a metaphor for the glittered frenzy of this fall's major auctions, which open on Tuesday with a sale of Impressionist and modern art at Christie's. 
 But beneath all the bling -- the glossy catalogs brimming with lavish illustrations, the extravagant parties to lure rich collectors, the impressive exhibitions of the art and the optimistically high estimates -- lurks an ominous question. After three years of speculation about a bust, will this be the moment when the art market finally crumbles? Auction house experts who have spent the last six months mapping out the sales say the business-getting season fell into two distinct chapters: before the subprime mortgage crisis struck in August, and after. 
 Flush from their record-setting May and June sales in New York and London, Sotheby's, Christie's and the boutique house Phillips de Pury assumed that the good times would roll on. Collectors were feeling optimistic too. As prices soared for artists they collected, many decided to cash in, so much so that an unusually large number of paintings, drawings and sculptures are coming to market. 
 Some of them have never made a public appearance; other works are all too familiar, having been on and off the auction block several times in just a few years. 
 To land the best works, however, the houses had to compete against one another, offering the sellers bigger and bigger guarantees, promises of undisclosed sums regardless of the outcome of the sale. If a work doesn't sell, the auction house must still fork out the guarantee and is often stuck with a burnt piece of art. 
 Before things got rough Sotheby's and Christie's had invested heavily in such guarantees -- about $1 billion between them. And even before the mortgage crisis hit in August, both abruptly stopped offering guarantees, feeling they had committed enough money to these sales. But they continued to promise sellers a cut of the fees each auction house charges to buyers. (While cutting significantly into the houses' potential profits, this was far less risky than guaranteeing a specific cash sum.) 
 After the tumultuous swings in stock prices spurred by the mortgage and equity crisis and on-and-off fears of a recession, this fall's auctions loom as a critical test of the art market's strength.
 The sellers include such seasoned collectors as the financiers Henry R. Kravis, Donald B. Marron and Mitchell P. Rales, the actor Hugh Grant and the entrepreneur Adam Lindeman. But who will the buyers be? 
 Fewer Americans, to hear it from the experts. With reduced bonuses and dwindling profits anticipated on Wall Street, the American buyers who have for years driven the surge in art prices may not be the biggest spenders this time. Instead Sotheby's and Christie's are banking on newly rich Russians, Asians and Middle Easterners. Having recently started collecting everything from Renoirs to Rauschenbergs, these collectors find New York a particularly attractive place to shop because of the weak dollar. 
 ''We are seeing a broader base of clients than ever before,'' said Marc Porter, president of Christie's in America. ''Americans only make up about a third of our active buyers.'' 
 In addition to what experts call ''wall power'' -- splashy works that shout ''status'' -- some of the paintings, drawings and sculptures up for sale are particularly rare. Christie's auction of Impressionist and modern art on Tuesday night, for example, includes a shimmering 1889 landscape by Signac painted during a stay in Cassis, a fishing village nestled amid yellow-red cliffs on the Cote d'Azur. The work, whose owner has not been identified, carries an estimate of $8 million to $12 million. The following evening Sotheby's will offer some unusual works on paper by Egon Schiele that are fresh to the market. 
 As has been true for years now, the biggest sales involve postwar and contemporary art. Coinciding with big solo museum shows devoted to the artists in New York and Los Angeles are works by Richard Prince, Martin Puryear and Takashi Murakami. Sotheby's has put big money into two exceptional Francis Bacon paintings -- an image of a bullfight and a self-portrait, both from 1969 -- while Christie's is betting that buyers will swoop in on Warhol's celebrity portraits of Elizabeth Taylor and Muhammad Ali. 
 Christie's has also heavily promoted its Nov. 12 sale of artworks from the estate of Allan Stone, the legendary New York dealer who died in December. A quirky mix of everything from Abstract Expressionist paintings to cigar-store Indians, tribal and folk art, and decorative objects by Antonio Gaudi and Carlo Bugatti, the collection's wide range of prices is geared toward clever connoisseurs and first-time buyers. 
 Works by Chinese artists like Zhang Xiaogang and Fang Lijun have also found their way into the big, general contemporary-art auctions. ''Owners don't want to see these works ghettoized,'' said Tobias Meyer, the director of contemporary art at Sotheby's. 
 Globalism is a mantra in this fall's auctions, along with the unspoken, incantatory ''What if?''
 Combing through the offerings, The New York Times set out to identify some tough sells, potential sleepers, familiar wares (read: shopped) and coincidences, like two strangely similar Rothkos at rival houses. 
 Dueling Rothkos
 Sotheby's and Christie's both have mystical gray-and-black paintings by Mark Rothko, executed the same year and painted on the same size (60 by 68 inches) canvas. The sellers of Sotheby's version, the Iowa collectors John and Mary Pappajohn, bought it at Christie's for $800,000 in 1996. Christie's Rothko was purchased from the John Weber Gallery by an unidentified collector. Why Sotheby's Rothko is supposedly worth $2 million to $3 million more is anyone's guess.
 Tough Sells
 Every auction has its long shots, yet these two, oddly enough, are emblazoned on catalog covers for the sales. The Gauguin is vibrant, it's beautifully painted and it has a distinguished pedigree. (It once belonged to Joan Whitney Payson, the philanthropist and onetime owner of the New York Mets.) Still, a Tahitian woman with her dress hiked up around her waist, squatting in the water, may not be the most appealing image, especially for the estimated price of $40 million to $60 million.
 Warhol's ''Liz,'' owned by the actor Hugh Grant, also carries a hefty estimate. But experts say the image is heavy-handed and not as sharp as the 12 other Elizabeth Taylor paintings in the series. If it doesn't do well, Christie's may be stuck. It gave Mr. Grant a guarantee that insiders estimated at $20 million.
 Shopped Around
 Auctions are often the last resort. After years of quietly offering works to collectors without success, sellers turn to the auction houses in the hope that wider exposure and a heady mood will bring strong prices. While Christie's catalog says that ''Le Jas de Bouffan'' is ''property from a distinguished collection,'' it is actually being sold by Seibu, a Japanese corporation, which acquired it at Sotheby's in 1990 for $7.1 million. For years Seibu has sought unsuccessfully to sell it privately. Similarly, the dealers Walter Feilchenfeldt (Zurich) and William Acquavella of New York have been quietly trying to sell van Gogh's ''Fields'' for months.
 Potential Sleepers
 Each season there are always a few works that set hearts beating. The Picasso head, depicting his mistress as a Greco-Roman goddess of sorts, was conceived in 1941 and cast in the 1950s in an edition of two. Insiders say it is considered one of his greatest sculptures and may well go far higher than its estimate. Experts are also buzzing about Matisse's richly patterned ''Odalisque.'' Abandoning the carefully delineated odalisques of the 1920s, he made a breakthrough in this painting to a spontaneous, simplified style. The result was a portrait that bore little resemblance to his subject, Lydia Delectorskaya, a Russian emigre and former studio assistant who was one of his favorite models. 

CORRECTION-DATE: December 10, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Two picture captions with an article last Sunday about fall art auctions were reversed. The Mark Rothko painting on the right, ''Untitled (Black and Gray),'' is being sold at Christie's on Tuesday, and the other Rothko painting, ''Untitled,'' is being sold at Sotheby's on Wednesday. 
An article on Nov. 15 about an auction of contemporary art at Sotheby's misspelled the surname of the Manhattan collector who sold the Jeff Koons sculpture ''Hanging Heart (Magenta/Gold).'' He is Adam Lindemann, not Lindeman. (The error also appeared in articles on Nov. 4 and May 18 of this year, and on June 28, 2004.)

HEADLINE: Productivity May Explain The Market

BYLINE: By CONRAD DE AENLLE

 BODY:
IF you have been baffled by stocks' ability to race higher, even as the price of just about every commodity soars, some clarity may arrive this week with the Labor Department report on third-quarter productivity. 
 A sharp increase in commodity prices is feared for its potential to drive up costs of manufactured goods and to compel the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to curb inflation. The Fed expressed concern about rising energy costs in the statement that accompanied its rate cut last week, a worry shared by the bears on Wall Street.
 The productivity report Wednesday could allay some of that concern, according to Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. A highly productive economy allows for robust growth with subdued inflation; he expects the report to confirm such conditions' presence.
 A Bloomberg News poll of economists estimates that productivity grew at an annual rate of 3.1 percent in the three months through September. That is above the 2.6 percent annual rate of the second quarter.
 Mr. Yardeni says he believes that we are living through ''the greatest global boom of all time'' and that the productivity report will help to confirm that by coming in with a gain of about 3 percent. 
 ''That's very bullish because it suggests that we can have upward pressure on commodity prices and materials costs reflecting a global boom without spilling over into core inflation,'' he said. ''It means the Fed doesn't have to raise interest rates.''
 He said the productivity rate could touch 4 percent if the construction industry is removed from the equation. 
 Mr. Yardeni prefers to point to the positive aspects of rising commodity prices. They ''have a very high correlation with corporate profits,'' he said, and are ''the best real-time indicators of industrial activity.''
 ''Commodities from oil to gold to wheat are confirming that the global economy continued to boom through the summer credit crunch,'' he said. ''It supports the notion that the global boom has a life of its own apart from the subprime mortgage crisis and the U.S. housing market slump.''
 A healthy third-quarter productivity report could extend the boom.
 ''For commodities and stocks it's a very bullish scenario, and for bonds it's not so bad, either,'' he said. ''The situation is like Goldilocks on steroids.''
 DATA WATCH On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management will announce its survey on nonmanufacturing segments of the economy. The Bloomberg poll forecasts an index reading of 54 for October, down from 54.8 in September.
 A monthly consumer confidence survey from the University of Michigan, due Friday, is expected to show little change. A reading of 80 is predicted, compared with 80.9 for October.

HEADLINE: Double or Nothing on the Democrat

BYLINE: By J. DAVID GOODMAN

 BODY:
WILLIAM MAYER, shamed and penniless after gambling away his rural Illinois home on a bad wager, hanged himself on Nov. 9, 1904. The New York Daily Herald carried word of his demise in a one-sentence brief alongside more felicitous news of those who had picked more wisely. 
 Wall Street investors called it ''pay day,'' The Herald reported. ''Millions Paid in Bets,'' The New York Tribune added matter-of-factly. It was the Wednesday after the presidential election, and the winning wagers had been placed on Theodore Roosevelt. 
 Long before political prediction markets sprouted on the Internet, election bets -- whether the stakes were money or embarrassing public spectacles -- were a ubiquitous part of the American political scene. The practice, which began informally with petty stakes in pool halls in the late 19th century, was by 1900 a multimillion-dollar trade on Wall Street.
 In the 1916 contest between Woodrow Wilson and Charles Evans Hughes, about $160 million (in current dollars) was wagered on Wall Street's outdoor ''curb exchange.'' By contrast, the 2004 election saw less than $25 million in contracts change hands over the outcome on the Dublin-based InTrade.com market, the largest and most active for-profit market for odds on current American elections. 
 The markets, famous for their accuracy in a time before reliable polling, are once again being praised for their predictive power, which will be tested again on Election Day this Tuesday. Last year, Slate.com began a regular feature called ''Political Futures: Betting on the Election.'' In September, the Web site of The National Journal introduced a fantasy market where users can bet play money on candidates for the 2008 presidential election, a year from today. 
 While markets in most major cities took wagers on election outcomes, New York's curb exchange was the largest, with a betting handle around 200 times that of today's Iowa Electronic Markets, a modern version created at the University of Iowa in 1988.
 The Curb market, which would grow into the American Stock Exchange, began as a loose gathering of traders who sold penny stocks and other less-than-blue-chip investments on Broad Street, literally on the curb in front of the New York Stock Exchange. Traders known as betting commissioners would offer stakes in coming elections and often demanded cash upfront, especially if the bettor was a stranger or from out of town. The larger of these bets were recorded in the newspaper.
 New York was a natural place for such markets because of its proximity to both Wall Street and the headquarters of the two political parties.
 ''Until the 1920s, New York would have been the center of gambling in the United States, what Las Vegas is today,'' said Paul Rhode, a professor of economic history at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Technically, gambling on the result of an election was -- and is -- illegal, but the laws were not widely enforced, and newspapers routinely reported the names of prominent bettors and the Wall Street firms that held the stakes.
 After hours, curb betting often moved indoors to uptown hotels like the Astor and the Waldorf-Astoria; and reporters followed the money. ''$300,000 Wagered in Broadway Hotels and $400,000 in Wall Street on Results,'' read the front page of The New York Daily Herald on Election Day 1904.
 Nearly half the bettors worked in banking or other white-collar jobs, but less-wealthy bettors were not without options. Because monetary bets often exceeded most annual salaries, many chose to gamble on an election by agreeing to engage in an embarrassing public spectacle if their candidate lost. 
 These ''freak bets'' were not just the province of the less well off, as The New York Times reported after the 1904 election: ''Brokers, and even bankers, play barrel organs; dignified citizens have their whiskers trimmed in every conceivable fashion but the one they are accustomed to; stout men roll a peanut up a steep hill with a wooden toothpick.''
 THE ''peanut and toothpick'' bet became a trend after the 1900 election, one practitioner being a 22-year-old resident of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, named John Stein. He had bet a friend that William McKinley would not carry New York State by more than 60,000 votes, and on Nov. 8, 1900, he paid off his wager by rolling a peanut up Ten Eyck Street, preceded by a band playing the Christian spiritual ''Roll, Jordan, Roll.'' 
 With the rise of polling in the 1930s and a decline in public approval of political gambling, election betting fell out of favor. The expansion of horse-track betting in 1939, giving people another arena in which to place their bets, also weakened interest in the markets.
 Reporters, too, could get political forecasts from increasingly reputable polling agencies. While The New York Herald Tribune still reported on the betting as late as 1940, the odds were relegated to an occasional small paragraph on the financial page, and neither bettors nor stakeholders were named. 
 The online prediction markets that cropped up around 2000 were less a dot-com revolution than a road back to the earlier form of election coverage. 
 ''In a few years, we may regard the second half of the 20th century as the aberration in which the press used polls rather than markets to track political races,'' Justin Wolfers, a business professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, wrote in an e-mail message. ''And in the 21st century, we may return to the habits of the early 20th century, reporting on political races through the lens of prediction markets rather than polls.''

HEADLINE: The Foreign Legions

BYLINE: By LAURA PAPPANO. 
Laura Pappano is co-author, with Eileen McDonagh, of ''Playing With the Boys: Separate Is Not Equal in Sports.'' Her last article for Education Life was on student loans.

 BODY:
FOR a student at the University of Ghana in Legon, a palm-graced suburb of Accra, a dinner might involve fufu -- mashed casava and plantains in a soup of peanut butter and tomatoes -- from a local ''chop bar.'' Electricity is not a given. Nor is running water. Students might have to fetch buckets of water to flush the toilet and wash clothes. Forget sleeping in. They rise at 5 a.m., when the chaos and din begin: loud music and evangelical preaching, through megaphones. The ''Challenges of Living in Ghana'' handout from the University of California advises bringing earplugs.
 The country, and its flagship university, have become a newly popular destination for studying abroad: about 300 American students, representing dozens of campuses, take classes at Legon. 
 But American students expect a standard of food and housing (and sleep) that is not typical in West Africa. So New York University has imported the creature comforts of home. Its nearby complex has air-conditioning (power guaranteed), 24-hour security, an on-site nurse, wireless Internet. Students who prefer not to take the 10-minute walk can use shuttle buses between the N.Y.U. Center, where they take class with N.Y.U. professors, and the Legon campus, where they are encouraged to enroll in a class. They eat in a dining hall that serves African food interpreted for ''the American palate,'' says Yaw Nyarko, vice provost for globalization and multicultural affairs at N.Y.U. Some, he says, think the accommodations are better than New York's. 
 ''We are creating an entire infrastructure,'' he says. The ambitious N.Y.U. program can include mounting art exhibitions for American students in Accra and bringing over film professors from New York to accompany them to neighboring countries for film festivals. The semester comes to about $28,000 all told.
 Meanwhile, across the world, Boston College's study-abroad program in Parma, Italy, includes skiing at Mont Blanc. Millsaps College, in Jackson, Miss., owns a 4,000-acre tropical forest in the Yucatan, where its students study archaeology, geology, sociocultural anthropology and even math, analyzing data from Mayan ruins. Students studying abroad in Costa Rica with the University of Georgia go white-water rafting on the Pacuare River.
 Whatever happened to the junior-year excursion to Europe for foreign-language majors?
 There is a consensus today, much like the one about science and math studies after the launch of Sputnik 50 years ago, that globally fluent graduates are essential to American competitiveness. International exposure, whether study, volunteer work or internship, has become a must-have credential. With the new demand -- the number studying abroad is twice that of eight years ago -- what was once an add-on has become big business. About 6,000 programs send students to more than 100 countries.
 And for a generation whose life is calibrated by a multicolored spiral daily planner, just being abroad is not enough. They want to do more than study a language; they want an experience that complements their stateside curriculums. University of Chicago students can meet a civilization core requirement by attending a 10-week program taught by its own faculty in Mexico, China or India. Half of last spring's graduating class at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Massachusetts studied abroad -- many in fields like engineering and science, whose rigid course sequences once kept them home. W.P.I. students are tackling projects like creating wireless security systems or flood-prevention plans in places as far afield as Limerick, Ireland, and Cape Town, South Africa. 
 In a world in which flying to Europe feels like driving from Boston to Pennsylvania, students are asking for more exotic destinations. They are going at different points in their college careers (entering freshmen at N.Y.U. can now spend their very first semester in London) and they're doing it in shorter bursts (some go more than once). At Yale, 82 percent of those who go abroad do it in summer. Jane Edwards, Yale's associate dean for international affairs, gives the reasoning: ''You worked so hard to come to this amazing university, why would you trade in one of your eight precious semesters?'' 
 But for colleges, setting up science programs and a relevant experience in Africa or China is far more complicated than arranging home stays for art-history majors. Even colleges and universities that have long run programs -- in some cases for more than a century -- are straining to keep up as study abroad leaves the fringe and becomes a featured offering. Indiana University, which sent its first students abroad in 1879, now offers 200 programs; it has a study-abroad staff of only 12. 
 Many colleges have had to look outside their gates, to other colleges, nonprofit organizations and for-profit companies that have the local connections to arrange housing, classes and services in countries where students want to study. 
 ''The growth in demand is outstripping most campuses' ability to meet it,'' says William W. Hoffa, a former study-abroad adviser at Amherst College who now consults independently.
 With the explosion in study-abroad programs, criticism from inside and outside the field has brought scrutiny of its practices.
 Andrew M. Cuomo, New York's attorney general, is looking into whether the tuition policies and restrictions on course credit at certain colleges prevent students from participating in less expensive programs offered by others. There is also concern that financial relationships between colleges and third-party program providers force students to pay more than the actual costs. Benjamin M. Lawsky, Mr. Cuomo's deputy counselor, says they have received information suggesting that familiarization trips paid for by providers have spurred study-abroad officials to use those programs.
 ''We are certainly examining whether study abroad has become artificially expensive,'' Mr. Lawsky says.
 At the heart of the inquiry is the ''home-school tuition'' policy that many colleges are moving toward -- students pay regular tuition and fees, no matter where in the world they go. Educators argue that the policy keeps students from choosing programs merely because they are cheap (and possibly shoddy) and encourages them to choose programs because they interest them. Critics counter that it discourages students from going to outside programs that are less pricey, or enrolling in a foreign university on their own. 
 In other words, Mr. Lawsky asks, ''Does the home tuition policy end up making study abroad something that only the most well-to-do students end up participating in?''
 Which leads to the field's second front. The number of students going abroad may be growing -- to about 6 percent of American college students, not counting those who don't get course credit -- but their profile has not changed. The latest figures available from the Institute of International Education, for 2004-5, indicate that 83 percent of participants were white; 10 years earlier, 86 percent were white.
 Representative Tom Lantos, Democrat of California and chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, says that for too long study abroad has been ''an exclusive Ivy League wealthy kid opportunity.'' He is co-sponsor of a bill that would send 1 million underrepresented students each year to places like China, the Middle East and developing countries. 
 ''It is really trying to reach out to a new group of students,'' says the bill's Senate co-sponsor, Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois (his daughter studied abroad in London). The bill passed the House in June and awaits action in the Senate.
 The legislation, which would increase student participation fivefold, reflects the evolution of study abroad from self-enriching activity to social tool. Aside from being considered critical to American economic and intellectual competitiveness, study abroad is also viewed as a way to improve international relations, one home-stay at a time. Mr. Lantos, who was born in Budapest, calls it ''one of the most significant avenues for making the United States more competitive and more culturally sensitive.''
 WHAT should the study-abroad experience look like? How much studying should be involved? How do you nudge students into becoming cultural learners? 
 As those in the field debate the shape and direction of international education, not everyone is happy with the way things are headed. 
 Carl Good, director of undergraduate studies in Spanish at Indiana University Bloomington, is disturbed at how the international experience is ''being hawked left and right.'' In his view, the new demand has yielded programs that are ''half spring break and half really serious learning.'' Some programs have minimal requirements for grade point average or previous coursework -- and it's possible to study in Spain without speaking much Spanish. ''Now the barriers are so low,'' he says, ''more students may go who may not take it seriously.'' 
 Brown and Yale will not accept courses on any basis but pass/fail. To focus students on academics, Indiana University applies study-abroad grades to the G.P.A.
 Adam Weinberg, provost of the School for International Training in Brattleboro, Vt., a nonprofit group that runs study-abroad programs, is bluntly critical of holiday-like offerings. ''There is a lot of time for travel and vacation,'' he says. ''Study-abroad programs should be the most rigorous experience of one's college career.''
 The degree of rigor varies a lot. Some students bring back a semester of easy A's. Others, especially those enrolled in foreign universities, work like dogs and still get C's. In a Spanish university (not to be confused with a classroom of Americans in Spain), professors commonly fail half the class, Mr. Good says. ''Students are often dismayed getting a B or C or D when they expected an A.''
 Academic and emotional demands are high for a program in which students enroll at the University of Bologna, taking courses alongside Italian students -- including oral exams. ''You really have to be good,'' says Kathleen Sideli, associate vice president for overseas study at Indiana University, which runs the program. ''Most of the students going to Florence could not do that.'' Ms. Sideli says students get stuck on the image of ''study abroad'' as attending lectures at foreign universities, even if they don't speak the language. In reality, programs are increasingly tailor-made for study abroad.
 ''Island programs'' cluster Americans in a foreign location where they are taught mostly in English about culture, language and history, and take guided trips and attend cultural outings. The programs can allow a female Arabic major to travel more comfortably in a Muslim country, but they don't force contact with local people.
 Mr. Nyarko knows the N.Y.U. approach in Ghana is criticized as an ''American bubble.'' But, he explains, ''What we do is give our students a home where they can come back and relax and then meet and interact with Ghanaian society on their own terms when they are ready for it.''
 Caryn Gordon, who graduated last May from Syracuse University, spent a semester in Madrid in an island program run by Syracuse, whose offerings are popular with other colleges and universities. She appreciated the English-language assistance from staff navigating a foreign city. ''If there were times where you didn't know where to get your hair cut, they would help you.''
 Ms. Gordon lived with a local family and took classes with other Americans, many from Syracuse, about Spanish art and culture, only one of them taught in the language. She hadn't initially wanted to spend a semester away -- ''I was a V.P. in the sorority,'' she explains -- but had heard ''such great things'' about studying abroad. ''I just wanted to see more and more cities.'' 
 ''I didn't feel the need to go out and meet Spanish people, just personally,'' she adds. She did return home with a new circle of Syracuse friends she'd met in Spain.
 Mallory Plaks, a University of North Carolina junior, rejected Florence, Italy, for the very reason that it is overrun with members of the study-abroad generation -- ''I might as well be in Chapel Hill.'' 
 Seeing the places she was studying, in courses on the rise of modern Europe and Czech history, ''was just very awesome.'' But she hadn't realized she would be living and taking classes with Americans (at a center created for international students). ''I don't know how I missed this,'' she says. ''I thought it was integrated with a Czech university and you would be around a lot of Czech students. Unless you went out of your way, you didn't meet any.'' Among her classes was beginning Czech. 
 Such miscues are common but puzzle study-abroad advisers, who don't see how students without language skills imagine themselves enrolled in foreign universities.
 ALEXANDRIA HOLLETT'S total immersion at the University of Bologna sounds more like ''Survivor'' than study abroad. Students stay in a pensione for orientation before the first challenge: Find a place to live. ''Basically, what we had to do is walk up and down the streets of Bologna and rip flyers off the wall of Italian students advertising for roommates,'' she says. ''It was a really stressful experience.''
 At registration, classes she had planned on weren't offered, so she had to find other courses to count toward her triple major in English, Italian and Spanish (in Europe especially, professors switch what they're teaching at the last minute). Lectures lasted an hour and a half (the American standard: 50 minutes). Professors talked at students (no raising hands) and answered cellphones in class. One talked to a caller for 20 minutes, she says.
 The oral exam at semester's end was ''intense.'' ''The teacher would say, 'Tell me something profound that is worth my time,' '' Ms. Hollett recalls. ''You have to know everything that was ever said, anything in a text, anything a teacher hinted at, but didn't say.'' All in Italian. ''For me, personally, I was really starting to appreciate the American education system.''
 Not all students are prepared to cope with the challenges that arise from being immersed in a foreign society. ''There are students who aren't ready to separate themselves from American culture and language,'' says Eric Singer, dean of international studies at Goucher College, in Baltimore, which has begun requiring students to earn at least three credits abroad. ''They don't want to be challenged about language, food, sports or what have you,'' he says.
 R. Michael Paige, professor of international and intercultural education at the University of Minnesota, says the struggles of getting along -- from figuring out how to make a phone call to managing a rocky host-family relationship -- are central study-abroad experiences.
 ''This is not about saying you loved everything that happened to you,'' Mr. Paige says. ''The world wasn't set up so students could just walk in there and feel comfortable. They are walking into other cultural contexts.''
 Last spring, Stephanie Brockman traveled to Oman. Then a junior at Yale majoring in Arabic and Islamic studies, she had realized that the more she studied, the more she ''had no idea'' what she was talking about.
 But first, she went home -- to a town of less than 1,000 south of Grand Forks, N.D., where she and her father rented a film about Al Jazeera, the Arabic television network, and he fretted about the trip.
 The Oman program, run by the School of International Training, included Arabic language class, a research project (she interviewed high school students about their plans for the future) and courses about Oman's culture and politics, taught in English.
 But the real education was living with a family. For example, no speaking to the family cousin, a male college student living in the home -- at least not more than ''hi.'' She struggled daily to secure a headscarf, relying excessively on safety pins. She was accompanied at all times. ''They really don't understand alone-time,'' she says.
 Sometimes she escaped to the City Center Mall in Muscat, where she found sweet relief in the air-conditioning, got some culturally acceptable exercise (not pushups), practiced her Arabic with salespeople and sniffed the familiar scent of strawberry body butter at the Body Shop, her favorite destination.
 On her return, longing for the spicy ambience of Oman, Ms. Brockman burned frankincense. She appreciated the less rigid gender rules of the West but was struck by Americans' skimpy dress. ''It was shocking how much skin I saw,'' she says. Even now, girls in tank tops and boys in shorts ''still kind of bothers me.''
 In some respects, study abroad has become for this generation what going to college was for their parents. Being in a place a dozen time zones away, where Internet service and cellphones are unreliable, provides one of the first chances for true and prolonged independence.
 Zena Bibler calls her semester in Buenos Aires ''equal parts terrible and awesome.''
 Ms. Bibler was your typical overcommitted Yale history major, leading a modern dance group, helping New Haven teenagers talk out conflicts and catching up with friends by arranging ''study dates.'' In a program arranged through Butler University in Indianapolis, she took courses at three city universities and shed her ''tunnel vision.''
 She started going to dance halls to learn to tango and befriended (actually dated, much to the relief of her mother, who worried about her spending nights out) a police officer. A vegan going hungry in the land of beef, she discovered she loved meat-filled choripans for two pesos. She got around on buses that were routinely rerouted by political demonstrations (or a driver's whim). Her first host mother kept burning the food and gave her a tiny closet of a room with a window that didn't close. She found a second, happier home-stay.
 ''It made me more self-sufficient,'' she reflects. ''I had to make decisions by myself. I couldn't call my dad and say, 'What classes should I take?' Instead of my mom telling me I would get sick if I stayed up three nights in a row, I just had to do it.''
 With her second host mother, she passed hours talking about Argentine life and politics while sipping from tiny white ceramic cups the Twinings Earl Grey tea she had brought from home.

SECTION: Section 10; Column 0; Automobiles; BEHIND THE WHEEL 2008 MERCEDES-BENZ C-CLASS; Pg. 1

LENGTH: 1120 words

HEADLINE: An Associate Makes Full Partner

BYLINE: By KEITH MARTIN

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
 MERCEDES-BENZ claims to be the world's oldest automaker, starting with the Patent Motorwagen of 1886. And it was a pioneer as well in exploring the potential for smaller, less expensive entry-luxury cars, having introduced Americans in 1983 to the four-cylinder 190 Baby Benz. 
 The 190 was underpowered, undersized and certainly understyled, and the ones still on the road look more like used-up Toyota Corollas than Mercedes-Benzes. Even with the succeeding C-Class models introduced in 1993 and 2000, it seemed as if Mercedes was determined that no one would confuse the tot with the adults, like the definitive E-Class or its uber-brother, the S-Class. 
 The great unwashed could buy a C-Class, but they had to use a Mercedes Jr. charm on their keychain. 
 Times have changed. Perhaps the most striking element of the latest C-Class, all new for 2008, is that it doesn't look like a C at all; at first glance you might think you're gazing at an E-Class that was run through the dryer, shrinking slightly in all dimensions. My wife has a 2006 E350 in the same pewter color as one of the C-Class test cars I recently drove, and when the E and C were parked nose-to-tail in our driveway it took more than a glance to tell them apart.
 The C is an important model for Mercedes, being both its volume leader and an entry point for first-time customers. 
 The new model is offered in three distinct versions: the C300 Luxury, the C300 Sport and the C350 Sport. All have four-cam aluminum-alloy V-6 engines with four valves for each cylinder. The 3-liter engines in the 300 models produce 228 horsepower and 221 pound-feet of torque, and the 3.5-liter unit in the 350 makes 268 horsepower and 258 pound-feet. The C300 Luxury and C350 Sport come with a seven-speed automatic; a six-speed manual is standard on the C300 Sport.
 Both Sport versions sit a half-inch lower because of their sport-tuned suspensions. They also have body modifications from the company's AMG performance division, and dual exhausts.
 Fuel economy ratings for all three versions are almost identical: 18 m.p.g. in town and 25 on the highway for the C300 Luxury, 18/26 for the C300 Sport and 17/25 for the C350.
 The new C-Class is bigger in every dimension than the car it replaces: 3.9 inches longer, 1.7 inches wider and 1.4 inches higher. There is a bit more shoulder room in the front and rear, and a slight bump in trunk size.
 The styling is assertive, with a downward-slanted nose and upswept trim lines along the sides. Striking 17-inch 5-spoke wheels are standard; 18-inch rims are an option on Sport models. 
 The three-pointed star is now set into the front grille on Sport models -- the first time a Mercedes sedan has received this treatment.
 The Luxury model has a hood ornament bearing the tristar emblem, like other Mercedes sedans. The C300 Sport starts at $32,750, the C300 Luxury at $34,450 and the 350 Sport at $38,050. The C300 also comes with 4Matic all-wheel-drive starting at $35,990 (Sport) and $36,250 (Luxury).
 As attractive as these base prices may seem, by the time various option packages are added (like a $2,950 entertainment package including navigation or the $2,750 Premium II package of luxury appointments), a $40,000 C-Class is easily achieved.
 I tested rear-wheel-drive versions of all three models on a day-long 300-mile loop around Mount Hood. Each car had a distinct personality. The C300 Luxury, while roomy and comfortable, didn't like to be pushed hard; its front end did not respond as quickly as I would have liked in high-speed turns, and with both 300s there was a slight delay when the gas pedal was depressed -- a familiar Mercedes characteristic. 
 Both Sports felt crisper, with less body roll, and the throttle response of the C350 was nearly instantaneous. The combination of a slick six-speed manual and a stiffer suspension made the C300 Sport by far the most rewarding version for spirited driving.
 Not that the BMW 3 Series should be quaking in its run-flat booties, but the C350 is definitely honking at its door. While the BMW is a car with a sporty edge, offering its luxury accouterments begrudgingly, the C350 makes a luxury statement first and adds performance as a bonus. 
 Car and Driver recorded a 0-60 time of 6.0 seconds for the C350, compared with 5.6 seconds for the BMW 330i six-speed. The Sport makes its intentions clear with a silver instrument cluster, brushed aluminum trim and a three-spoke steering wheel.
 As much as I prefer driving a manual transmission to any type of automatic, it is clear that manual gearboxes will soon be viewed as fossils. In most forms of driving, especially daily commutes in stop-and-go traffic, an electronic automatic is vastly superior to a three-pedal setup. The seven-speed automatic in the C-Class (standard in the Luxury and 350, a $1,440 option on the 300 Sport) shifts crisply and unobtrusively. 
 Still, given how good the transmission is, the lack of paddle shifters behind the steering wheel is a glaring omission. Yes, you can shift by tapping the console-mounted lever, but given the performance pretensions of the Sport models, the lack of paddles is inexcusable. 
 Past Mercedes of any class have not been noted for being technological friendly, so the new C-Class is a big step forward. In comparison with BMW's near-pathological adherence to its confounding iDrive control system, Mercedes is trying to straddle the fine line between having efficient electronic interfaces and being easy to use.
 Clever touches abound. With the multimedia-navigation package, a button conjures a seven-inch liquid-crystal screen out of the dash. The controls are fairly intuitive, in contrast to most German cars.
 Further, the navigation system has a built-in hard drive with the capability to download songs from an iPod or MP3 player, and to burn CDs from them. There is a slot for a memory card, a glovebox-mounted iPod connector and a spare power outlet. (The glovebox is climate controlled in case you want to chill your hot tracks.) 
 Oddly, when the $375 iPod/MP3 interface is installed, the portable device can be controlled only by buttons on the steering wheel. 
 The trunk is spacious; a split folding rear seat is optional. Six air bags are standard, as are antilock brakes and stability control.
 Of the three models, the C300 Sport with manual gearbox will be the choice for most first-time Benz owners who haven't completely matured out of their BMW boy-racer phase. It is the least expensive, yet has enough look and feel of the upmarket E- and S-Class to let your friends know you've arrived, at least to the entry point of the star-emblazoned automotive world.
 INSIDE TRACK: Less of a baby and more of a Benz.

HEADLINE: Out West, a Falling Lake Lowers All Boats

BYLINE: By DAN BARRY. 
A tour of Lake Mead in audio and photos is online at nytimes.com/danbarry.

DATELINE: LAKE MEAD, Nev. 

 BODY:
 All aboard the Desert Princess for the 2 o'clock tour of historic Lake Mead, and please smile for your souvenir photograph, available for purchase at the end of this excursion. What a beautiful afternoon, with the sky an endless ocean of blue. Not a rain cloud in sight.
 Loaded now with its camera-wielding cargo, the paddle-wheeling Desert Princess begins a lake loop that will include a reverent pause before the majestic Hoover Dam. Kick back in the enclosed bar, or grab one of the plastic seats on the open top deck, and drink it all in: 
 The glassy surface waters of the lake. The looming desert hills, now umber, now chocolate. The chalky whiteness that covers the lake-side faces of those hills; a wall of white, really, rising dozens of feet in the air and prompting one's inner naturalist to wonder, What the heck is that?
 As the boat churns along, a recorded narration discusses everything from the dinosaurs that once roamed to the gradual filling of what is now Lake Mead, after the dam's completion in 1935. But the disembodied narrator never mentions those prominent hills of white defining the view from port and starboard, bow and stern.
 Explanation, then, is left to a sun-baked, window-washing deckhand. He lowers his squeegee and, with the inflection of someone struggling to be patient with the slow-witted, says: ''We're in a nine-year drought.''
 That whiteness covering the desert hillsides is a sort of bathtub ring, measuring through calcium and other mineral deposits how much the water level has dropped in Lake Mead over the years, but especially within the last decade. And if you squint and look way, way up, you can see signs at the very tops of some of those hills that, in effect, say the open air is closed to water skiing.
 The melting snow on the western slopes of the Rockies feeds into the Colorado River to flow west and south, across parts of Colorado, Utah and Arizona, and, since the construction of the dam, into Lake Mead, some 30 miles east of that study in population explosion, Las Vegas. The lake's water level has risen and fallen, like a sleeping man's chest, but never has the drop been quite like this.
 ''Lake Mead is at 49 percent of capacity,'' says Scott Huntley, spokesman for the Southern Nevada Water Authority. In other words: half empty.
 True, the lake's water level was this low 45 years ago, though Mr. Huntley attributes much of that to the filling of Lake Powell, 490 miles upriver in Utah. And true, the water level fluctuates naturally; that is why the Desert Princess's onboard narration never utters the word ''drought,'' a spokeswoman explains.
 But the lake was lapping at the top of Hoover Dam just two decades ago, making this drought all the more unnerving. For years its ''normal'' elevation ranged between 1,180 and 1,220 feet above sea level; today it is at 1,111 feet, and predicted to drop below 1,100 feet within two years.
 Now there are tense meetings among several states that rely on the Colorado for drinking water, power production and crop irrigation. Now the head of the water authority here attributes the drought's length and severity to climate change. Now the operative word is ''conserve.''
 Roxanne Dey, a National Park Service spokeswoman for the Lake Mead National Recreation Area, says that believe it or not, the drought has had at least one positive impact: ''It reminds people here that we live in a desert.'' 
 The Desert Princess, which is available for romantic evening cruises, class reunions and Christmas parties, turns to face the Hoover Dam, a stunning gray wall of concrete 726 feet high and 1,244 feet across. Here in the wildness of the Black Canyon, it seems almost unreal, like a mirage. 
 The paddle-wheeler begins its grind back to shore. The bar is selling Lake Mead postcards taken when the water level was much higher, judging by the relative shortness of the white on the walls in the background. (Three years ago? Four?) The sound system is playing oldies music, lending a slight dance-band-on-the-Titanic effect to the journey. 
 The Desert Princess returns to its dock, the one it began using four years ago after the waters around its original dock became too shallow. But nothing is certain here; its owners continue to join the park service in moving operations to meet the receding shoreline. They call this expensive endeavor ''chasing the water.''
 What the Desert Princess narration leaves unmentioned, a fishing guide named Mark Edison lives. You can sometimes see his 24-footer skipping past the paddle-wheeler, carrying clients who seek virtue in fishing for striped bass after a smoky night of gambling. He is 48, with graying hair set off by tanned skin. Years ago he gave up his job as a corporate chef to ply waters now diminishing.
 An hour after the Desert Princess docks in one marina, Mr. Edison launches his boat from another a few miles north, one that will move in a few months because its harbor is nearly unnavigable. ''We used to launch way up there,'' he says, pointing to a spot a few hundred yards up the dusty horizon. 
 His pointing continues: at a lone dock on a hill; at a camp in the dry distance that was once at waterside; at a squat water tank on Boulder Island that 75 years ago was instrumental in the Hoover Dam's construction. Not long ago, only divers could see the tank; not long ago, Boulder Island was called the Boulder Islands.
 There is still a lot of water in Lake Mead; at one point the sonar device on Mr. Edison's boat indicates 400 feet of water beneath. Still, as he skims across this lake of human design, this lake made even more precious by uncertainty, he keeps watch for shoals not there yesterday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Sanctions Force World Bank to Halt Some Iran Aid

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
The World Bank, newly caught up in the Bush administration's campaign against Iran, has had to suspend payments for earthquake relief, sanitation and other projects there in response to new American sanctions on leading Iranian banks, World Bank officials say. 
 Only $5.4 million in payments has been suspended for four projects, involving earthquake relief, water and sanitation, environment management and urban housing, the officials said, and they do not expect the suspensions to be permanent. 
 But the bank has no plan to resume payments because it is having trouble finding banks in Iran to handle them now that the United States has barred dealing with four of Iran's largest banks, accusing them of involvement in terrorism, or nuclear or missile programs.
 ''At this point, the World Bank is looking for alternate ways to support these projects,'' said a bank official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''It is unknown how difficult that might be. It is not that easy to find alternatives. We have no answer on how or when at this point.''
 American officials said they hoped that the decision by the World Bank would increase pressure on Iran, not necessarily by stopping humanitarian projects but by dramatizing the country's economic isolation in light of its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment and negotiate with the West over its nuclear program.
 The World Bank step, while small, illustrates the extraordinary reach of American sanctions, even though they were imposed unilaterally after the United States was stymied in its recent efforts to get the United Nations Security Council to approve wider penalties. 
 The payments for the World Bank projects have all gone through Bank Melli, one of Iran's largest banks, but Bank Melli was accused last month by the United States of being involved in nuclear proliferation and terrorism. Also listed were two other institutions, Bank Mellat and Bank Saderat. Bank Saderat had already been listed by United States as being involved in financing terrorism.
 Some Congressional critics of the administration's Iran policies have called on the United States to block World Bank aid programs for Iran altogether. The World Bank has nine active projects in Iran and, by last year, had financed 48 operations worth about $3.4 billion, according to the bank's Web site. 
 The effect of the United States' listing four major Iranian banks is that no American bank is allowed to facilitate any dollar-based transaction between them and any other bank in the world. 
 The Security Council has adopted two resolutions, one last year and another this year, calling on a freeze of assets in Iran deemed to be linked to its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The aim of the resolutions is to get Iran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities, which Western experts say are part of a secret program to make a nuclear bomb.
 Only one Iranian bank, Bank Sepah, has been identified by the Security Council as involved in nuclear and ballistic missile programs. According to information circulating among members of the Security Council, the bank has all but ceased to function.
 Bank Saderat, Bank Melli and Bank Mellat have been listed only by the United States. But Western diplomats, citing official information circulating in Europe and the United States, say that most major banks in Europe have ceased working or are winding down their business with them.
 In addition, the diplomats said the Dutch, French, Italian and German governments had begun reducing their state credits promoting trade with Iran. The Bush administration, however, is pressing them to do more.
 Administration officials say they have pressed more than 40 banks worldwide to stop doing business with Iran, and most have taken at least some steps. But banks in the Persian Gulf, China and other parts of Asia have continued, and in some cases have filled the gap left by the absence of Western banks.
 World Bank officials could not say whether the bank would turn to these institutions to help ease payments for the projects in Iran.

HEADLINE: Beyond Those Health Care Numbers

BYLINE: By N. GREGORY MANKIW. 
N. Gregory Mankiw is a professor of economics at Harvard. He was an adviser to President Bush and is advising Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, in the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.

 BODY:
WITH the health care system at the center of the political debate, a lot of scary claims are being thrown around. The dangerous ones are not those that are false; watchdogs in the news media are quick to debunk them. Rather, the dangerous ones are those that are true but don't mean what people think they mean.
 Here are three of the true but misleading statements about health care that politicians and pundits love to use to frighten the public:
 STATEMENT 1The United States has lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality than Canada, which has national health insurance. 
 The differences between the neighbors are indeed significant. Life expectancy at birth is 2.6 years greater for Canadian men than for American men, and 2.3 years greater for Canadian women than American women. Infant mortality in the United States is 6.8 per 1,000 live births, versus 5.3 in Canada. 
 These facts are often taken as evidence for the inadequacy of the American health system. But a recent study by June and Dave O'Neill, economists at Baruch College, from which these numbers come, shows that the difference in health outcomes has more to do with broader social forces.
 For example, Americans are more likely than Canadians to die by accident or by homicide. For men in their 20s, mortality rates are more than 50 percent higher in the United States than in Canada, but the O'Neills show that accidents and homicides account for most of that gap. Maybe these differences have lessons for traffic laws and gun control, but they teach us nothing about our system of health care.
 Americans are also more likely to be obese, leading to heart disease and other medical problems. Among Americans, 31 percent of men and 33 percent of women have a body mass index of at least 30, a definition of obesity, versus 17 percent of men and 19 percent of women in Canada. Japan, which has the longest life expectancy among major nations, has obesity rates of about 3 percent.
 The causes of American obesity are not fully understood, but they involve lifestyle choices we make every day, as well as our system of food delivery. Research by the Harvard economists David Cutler, Ed Glaeser and Jesse Shapiro concludes that America's growing obesity problem is largely attributable to our economy's ability to supply high-calorie foods cheaply. Lower prices increase food consumption, sometimes beyond the point of optimal health.
 Infant mortality rates also reflect broader social trends, including the prevalence of infants with low birth weight. The health system in the United States gives low birth-weight babies slightly better survival chances than does Canada's, but the more pronounced difference is the frequency of these cases. In the United States, 7.5 percent of babies are born weighing less than 2,500 grams (about 5.5 pounds), compared with 5.7 percent in Canada. In both nations, these infants have more than 10 times the mortality rate of larger babies. Low birth weights are in turn correlated with teenage motherhood. (One theory is that a teenage mother is still growing and thus competing with the fetus for nutrients.) The rate of teenage motherhood, according to the O'Neill study, is almost three times higher in the United States than it is in Canada.
 Whatever its merits, a Canadian-style system of national health insurance is unlikely to change the sexual mores of American youth
 The bottom line is that many statistics on health outcomes say little about our system of health care.
 STATEMENT 2 Some 47 million Americans do not have health insurance. 
 This number from the Census Bureau is often cited as evidence that the health system is failing for many American families. Yet by masking tremendous heterogeneity in personal circumstances, the figure exaggerates the magnitude of the problem.
 To start with, the 47 million includes about 10 million residents who are not American citizens. Many are illegal immigrants. Even if we had national health insurance, they would probably not be covered.
 The number also fails to take full account of Medicaid, the government's health program for the poor. For instance, it counts millions of the poor who are eligible for Medicaid but have not yet applied. These individuals, who are healthier, on average, than those who are enrolled, could always apply if they ever needed significant medical care. They are uninsured in name only.
 The 47 million also includes many who could buy insurance but haven't. The Census Bureau reports that 18 million of the uninsured have annual household income of more than $50,000, which puts them in the top half of the income distribution. About a quarter of the uninsured have been offered employer-provided insurance but declined coverage.
 Of course, millions of Americans have trouble getting health insurance. But they number far less than 47 million, and they make up only a few percent of the population of 300 million.
 Any reform should carefully focus on this group to avoid disrupting the vast majority for whom the system is working. We do not nationalize an industry simply because a small percentage of the work force is unemployed. Similarly, we should be wary of sweeping reforms of our health system if they are motivated by the fact that a small percentage of the population is uninsured.
 STATEMENT 3Health costs are eating up an ever increasing share of American incomes.
 In 1950, about 5 percent of United States national income was spent on health care, including both private and public health spending. Today the share is about 16 percent. Many pundits regard the increasing cost as evidence that the system is too expensive.
 But increasing expenditures could just as well be a symptom of success. The reason that we spend more than our grandparents did is not waste, fraud and abuse, but advances in medical technology and growth in incomes. Science has consistently found new ways to extend and improve our lives. Wonderful as they are, they do not come cheap.
 Fortunately, our incomes are growing, and it makes sense to spend this growing prosperity on better health. The rationality of this phenomenon is stressed in a recent article by the economists Charles I. Jones of the University of California, Berkeley, and Robert E. Hall of Stanford. They ask, ''As we grow older and richer, which is more valuable: a third car, yet another television, more clothing -- or an extra year of life?''
 Mr. Hall and Mr. Jones forecast that the share of income devoted to health care will top 30 percent by 2050. But in their model, this is not a problem: It is the modern form of progress.
 Even if the rise in health care spending turns out to be less than they forecast, it is important to get reform right. Our health care system is not perfect, but it has been a major source of advances in our standard of living, and it will be a large share of the economy we bequeath to our children. 
 As we look at reform plans, we should be careful not to be fooled by statistics into thinking that the problems we face are worse than they really are.

HEADLINE: Even Cut 50%, Earmarks Clog A Military Bill

BYLINE: By MARILYN W. THOMPSON and RON NIXON; Barclay Walsh contributed reporting.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
Even though members of Congress cut back their pork barrel spending this year, House lawmakers still tacked on to the military appropriations bill $1.8 billion to pay 580 private companies for projects the Pentagon did not request.
 Twenty-one members were responsible for about $1 billion in earmarks, or financing for pet projects, according to data lawmakers were required to disclose for the first time this year. Each asked for more than $20 million for businesses mostly in their districts, ranging from major military contractors to little known start-ups. 
 The list is topped by the veteran earmark champions Representative John P. Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat who is the chairman of the powerful defense appropriations subcommittee, and Representative C. W. Bill Young of Florida, the top Republican on the panel, who asked for $166 million and $117 million respectively. It also includes $92 million in requests from Representative Jerry Lewis, Republican of California, a committee member who is under federal investigation for his ties to a lobbying firm whose clients often benefited from his earmarks. 
 The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, requested $32 million in earmarks, while Steny H. Hoyer, the majority leader, asked for $26 million for projects in the $459.6 billion defense bill, the largest of the appropriations bills that go through Congress. 
 As promised when they took control of Congress in January, House Democratic leaders cut in half from last year the value of earmarks in the bill, as they did in the other 11 agency spending measures. But some lawmakers complained that the leadership failed to address what it had called a ''culture of corruption'' in which members seek earmarks to benefit corporate donors. Earmarks have been a recurring issue in recent Congressional scandals, most recently the 2005 conviction of Representative Randy Cunningham, Republican of California, for accepting bribes from defense contractors.
 ''Pork hasn't gone away at all,'' said Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, an earmark critic who cites the ''circular fund-raising'' surrounding many of them. ''It would be wonderful if this was a partisan issue, with Republicans on the right side, but it is really not. Many of these companies use money appropriated through earmarks to turn around and lobby for more money. Some of them are just there to receive earmarks.'' 
 Congressional earmarks are for programs that are not competitively bid , and the Bush administration has complained that they waste taxpayer dollars and skew priorities from military needs, like the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the global war on terror. 
 Thomas E. Mann, a Congressional scholar and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, though, sees the costs of earmarks as less of a problem than their potential for abuse. 
 ''The fiscal fallout of earmarks is trivial,'' he said. But they can lead to ''conflicts of interest, the irrational and unconstructive allocation of resources, or their use by Congressional leaders as carrots and sticks to buy votes for larger measures that clearly lack majority support on the merits.''
 The House version of the military bill includes 1,337 earmarks totaling $3 billion, the most Congressional earmarks in any of the spending bills passed this year. A conference committee is now reconciling House and Senate versions. The Senate added $5 billion in earmarks, but it is difficult to determine the sponsors because it has no disclosure rules. 
 About half of the House military earmarks go to universities, military bases and other public institutions; the other half to businesses and nonprofits. For the first time, members submitted written requests for each project and statements attesting that they had no personal financial interests in them. Previously, earmarks often were inserted anonymously. The New York Times analysis of earmarks used data compiled by the Washington-based watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense along with campaign contribution and lobbying records.
 Democrats consider earmark reform a success, since they have significantly reduced their cost and brought ''disclosure so constituents can see what their members have asked for,'' said Brendan Daly, a spokesman for Ms. Pelosi. ''That's one of the things we wanted to change, to bring more openness.'' But the House Republican Conference contends that Democrats still use earmarks as a secretive slush fund to reward contributors. 
 Mr. Murtha has drawn much attention this year, first as he bitterly opposed the legislation requiring disclosure of earmarks, then continued his habit of submitting dozens of requests, most benefiting his hometown of Johnstown, Pa. (He asked for 47 earmarks.) Two Republicans said he threatened to block them from getting any earmarks when they questioned one of his requests. ''You're not going to get any, now or forever,'' he warned Representative Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican who eventually received a written apology from the Pennsylvania congressman.
 The Republican Conference chairman, Adam H. Putman of Florida, said Mr. Murtha's behavior has been ''like watching a throwback in time.'' 
 ''He's a classic old-bull appropriator, basically showing a level of arrogance in which he breezily dismisses House rules, dismisses public inquiry and defies the spirit of disclosure,'' Mr. Putnam said.
 About $111 million of Mr. Murtha's earmarks are for businesses and nonprofits closely aligned with him. He recruits defense firms and jobs to his economically depressed district and often pushes earmarks for them. 
 ''I don't make apologies for having earmarks,'' Mr. Murtha, who declined to be interviewed for this article, told members in August. ''When we see something that we think is not as valuable as something else is, we change it.''
 Firms benefiting from Mr. Murtha's help have given at least $437,000 to his campaign since 2005, with about $110,000 streaming in just before this year's March 16 request deadline.
 Some of Mr. Murtha's earmarks are relatively small amounts for companies trying to gain a foothold in defense contracting, but few details about their projects are provided. KDH Defense Systems of Johnstown makes Navy body armor and Army elbow pads in a converted bra factory, and Mr. Murtha asked for a $2 million earmark to help the company improve its bulletproof vests. Another earmark would provide $3 million for KDH to develop a ''waterways threat detection system.'' 
 The company's lobbying firm is KSA Consulting, which employed Mr. Murtha's younger brother, Kit, until 2006. The firm has contributed $4,000 to Mr. Murtha's campaign since 2005. 
 Eight companies on Mr. Murtha's earmark list use a different lobbyist, the PMA Group, whose principals include Paul Magliochetti, a former aide to the defense appropriations subcommittee. The firm took in $840,000 in fees this year from those clients. PMA and its employees have given $58,600 to Mr. Murtha's campaign since 2005, according to contribution records. 
 Mr. Murtha included four earmarks worth $10 million for Concurrent Technologies Corporation, a Johnstown-based nonprofit run by major contributors that has won $226 million in earmarks since 2004, according to figures compiled by the taxpayers watchdog group. Concurrent also relies on other lawmakers for support, getting $8 million more in earmarks, including one worth $1.5 million from Mr. Young, whose district in Florida has a Concurrent office. Mr. Young said the company did valuable work for Special Forces.
 A Concurrent spokeswoman, Mary T. Bevan, said it was premature to discuss specific earmarks. ''Congressionally directed funding is a small part of CTC's overall revenues,'' she said in an e-mail message.
 In recent weeks, Concurrent has drawn attention, along with its sister operation, Commonwealth Research Institute, over whether Commonwealth paid a contract official for a no-show job while he awaited approval for an Air Force post. The man, Charles D. Riechers, died in an apparent suicide after a Congressional committee raised questions about the payments.
 Mr. Young requested earmarks for 51 projects totaling $117 million. All but 15 requests benefit defense firms. 
 The Florida congressman has collected about $150,000 in contributions since 2005 from companies for which he earmarked projects in this year's bill. Unlike Mr. Murtha, he received only one contribution -- a $2,000 donation from the political action committee of DRS Technologies -- in the days before the earmark deadline. A DRS spokesman said the company's PAC bought a ticket to a Young fund-raiser. 
 Mr. Young said that his earmark numbers were high because as ranking subcommittee member, he also seeks earmarks on behalf of other Republicans.
 He said he made requests only after ''personal contacts to the various agencies'' to make sure the projects were legitimate. ''I want to make sure we are not putting money into something the Pentagon does not feel they need,'' he said.
 Mr. Lewis, whose relationship with a lobbying firm is now under federal scrutiny, got $85,500 from six companies for which he sponsored earmarks. Science Applications International Corporation, which received a $4 million earmark, donated $5,000 two weeks before the earmark deadline.
 Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Hoyer each had 10 earmarks in the bill. Five of Ms. Pelosi's earmarks went to companies in her district, as did six of Mr. Hoyer's. 
 Ryan Alexander, director of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said the public deserved disclosure of the cost and purpose of each earmark. It is important, she said, to judge earmarked projects against other priorities, ''particularly in a time of two wars and so many demands on our resources.''

HEADLINE: Home-Office Politics

BYLINE: By MATT BAI. 
Matt Bai, who covers politics for the magazine, is the author of ''The Argument: Billionaires, Bloggers and the Battle to Remake Democratic Politics.''

 BODY:
Like other businesses, politics these days is conducted less in person than on speaker phone and laptops. Campaign consultants, policy analysts, fund-raisers and bloggers do most of their work in the comfort of their own homes, or in their cars, or maybe at Starbucks. Political professionals have as a result become part of a much larger American movement. In his new book, ''Microtrends,'' the Democratic pollster Mark Penn notes that 4.2 million Americans now work exclusively from home (a nearly 100 percent increase from 1990), while some 20 million do it part time. Some of these workers are employees who telecommute to traditional offices, but most represent a kind of modern, untethered American work force. 
 The federal government says nearly a third of workers qualify as ''independent,'' a category that includes self-employed professionals, contractors and part-time and temporary workers. For some reason, however, when it comes to making policy, political leaders seem to regard workplace independence as a privilege that should accrue only to affluent workers. Republicans, following the lead of George W. Bush and his ''ownership society,'' propose new savings and health-care plans that might help self-employed workers substitute for the benefits given by traditional employers, but only if they can put something extra away each month. Democrats meanwhile are prone to castigate employers who would outsource jobs to self-employed contractors, regarding the transition toward an independent work force as the mugging of the little guy. There is an accurate diagnosis in this view; certainly, a lot of employers are trying to shirk their responsibilities when they designate computer programmers or midlevel marketers as contingent workers. But the prescription -- that the only solution is to somehow shame companies into honoring a decades-old social contract -- ignores a historic opportunity to create a more enlightened notion of work.
 After all, why shouldn't more middle-class workers whose jobs can now be done remotely have the option to structure their own hours and still enjoy the security of a safety net? Why shouldn't data-entry clerks and graphic designers and actuaries and reservations agents -- anyone who spends his days staring at a terminal in some sterile environment straight out of ''Office Space'' -- be able to work in shorts and spend more time around the kids? According to Penn, stay-at-home workers actually log more hours than their counterparts in offices but report far higher rates of job satisfaction. The age of broadband means we might reasonably imagine a day when the American workplace of ''face time'' and endless polluting commutes fades slowly into the past, replaced by a society where vastly more workers get control over their daily lives.
 As it stands now, it's hard for eminently replaceable workers to negotiate this kind of freedom. But if workers' benefits weren't tied to employers, then they could transition into independent status without fear of losing their health care or pensions, and more employers would gladly oblige, since they could move costly benefits packages off their books. And yet the old, employer-based canon of policies makes it impossible for most workers with a modest income to even consider becoming their own bosses. Self-employed workers pay more than 15 percent of their incomes to Social Security, while traditional workers pay half that rate. (Some economists like to say this is a meaningless distinction, since employers are in theory taking their share of Social Security payments out of their employees' wages, but in practice few employers or employees see it that way.) Life and disability insurance remain prohibitively expensive for independent workers with modest incomes, and unemployment insurance and flexible spending accounts for child care are available only through employers.
 In other words, a system devised before the word ''telecommute'' ever existed helps to keep ordinary workers chained to their modular cubicles, while richer workers get to take advantage of a new, potentially liberating lifestyle. There are some significant agents for change; the New York Freelancers Union (now the fourth-largest in the state) offers benefits in some states and lobbies for independent workers, and the Service Employees International Union will soon unveil a program offering financial planning tools and health-insurance plans to self-employed or unemployed young workers. There are also some innovative ideas floating around. Writing in ''Democracy: A Journal of Ideas'' in 2005, Karen Kornbluh, Barack Obama's policy chief in the Senate, proposed replacing the employer-based benefits system with portable ''family insurance'' instead; this policy might include a flexible tax credit that could be used to offset health care, child care and other family-related expenses -- a potentially transformative idea that would benefit families who don't earn six figures. Obama himself has talked of the need to update the 20th-century social contract, though as a candidate he has offered few concrete proposals for doing so. This may be because, for Democrats in the Bush era, accepting changes in the workplace is considered tantamount to siding with Bushian corporatists.
 In fact, the current presidential candidates have moved only gingerly toward redefining the relationship between business, workers and government. Any of the leading Democratic candidates' health-care plans might constitute a critical step in that direction, since they would allow -- or even force -- independent workers to buy insurance from pooled plans or the government. No candidate, however, has yet envisioned a package of proposals that might make the self-employed society a reality for everyone. That means a political opening still exists. The last party to forge a social contract befitting a new technological era -- the New Deal-era Democrats -- ended up dominating American politics for more than half a century. The next 50 years are thus far unclaimed.

Elisabeth Franck-Dumas
 Are dinner parties more entertaining in Paris or New York? The key difference seems to lie in the topics of conversation: ''In France, people don't talk about their work,'' says the Paris-based writer Elisabeth Franck-Dumas, who sat in on the eclectic Parisian soiree hosted by Herve Van der Straeten and his partner, Bruno Frisoni, documented on Page 122. ''They talk about books, food and things that store well in their freezers.'' Franck-Dumas, who often reported on the Manhattan social circuit when she worked at The New York Observer, says the other key to a successful get-together is ''great wine -- and lots of it.'' To kick-start a tete-a-tete-filled fete, she recommends bottles of Chateau Haut-Bailly and the novel ''Arlington Park,'' by Rachel Cusk (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). ''I don't want to give away the plot,'' she says, ''but let's just say there is a dinner party that goes awry.''
 Edward Helmore 
 He's profiled musicians from Curtis Mayfield to Pete Doherty, so the New York-based British journalist Edward Helmore was well equipped to interview the British rocker turned design star Tom Dixon, the results of which are on Page 110. 'I actually listened to Dixon's old band, Funkapolitan, recently,'' Helmore says. ''He's managed to translate some of the anarchic quality of his music into his furniture.'' (Peter Saville designed the cover of the band's eponymous 1982 album, shown at far left.) Helmore is equally adept at switching subjects; a recent story he wrote on economic development and climate change in the Arctic allowed him a change of culinary scenery as well. ''I ate arctic char while I was there, he says. ''It is quite a bit like rich salmon, which was a nice surprise.''
 Anna Winger
 When a New Yorker tells you that big apartments are the norm, chances are they no longer live in Gotham. For the writer and photographer Anna Winger, who relocated to Berlin several years ago, more square footage equals more problems. ''An apartment is like a child,'' says Winger, who discusses the phenomenon on Page 82. ''The bigger it gets, the more energy and planning it requires.'' (A picture of her spacious apartment is shown at center.) Her coming ventures include the release of her first novel, ''This Must Be the Place'' (Riverhead Books), and a book of photographs she took on and around the sets of popular German television shows (an example of which is at far right). ''There are always unfinished projects awaiting me at home,'' she adds. ''I have great ambitions for my huge hallway.''
 Marcus Gaab
 Shooting a completely-to-scale two-story house made of cardboard was quite a production. But for Marcus Gaab, who photographed ''Inside the Box'' on Page 114, it was an easy one thanks to the efforts of the set designer Stefan Beckman -- a regular T contributor who also constructs the intricate sets for Marc Jacobs's runway presentations -- and his team. ''It's amazing how versatile Stefan was able to make it, Gaab explains. ''We were really able to treat it like a house.'' (An example of his previous work for The New York Times Magazine is at far left.) While shooting the recyclable home in New York, the Berlin-based Gaab stayed at the Mercer Hotel, where he fell in love with the ''cozy and easy'' charm of the lobby (center). He recently traveled to Monaco to attend the opening of the show ''Fan Monuments,'' a collaboration with the artist Candice Breitz that was organized by Princess Caroline. 
 Stephanie DeArmond
 The work of the ceramicist Stephanie DeArmond, whose floral-print porcelain T can be seen on Page 103, straddles very different worlds, pairing the granny chic of Delft pottery with a contemporary vernacular cribbed from tabloid rags and indie song lyrics. (One of her favorite bands is the Brooklyn-based Grizzly Bear, whose new EP, ''Friend,'' is shown at far right.) ''I like to mix old and new elements together,'' she says, ''and to use words to evoke a memory or hide a message.'' (One such work is at center.) DeArmond, who recently showed her work at Romo Gallery in Atlanta, plans to move from Colorado to the holy land of Delftware: the Netherlands.

HEADLINE: The Weeklong Semester

BYLINE: By CECILIA CAPUZZI SIMON

 BODY:
WHO said education had to be meted out over 16 weeks, 40 hours a course? After all, the traditional semester was not born of some deep insight into the human learning process; it was just a logical timetable for an agrarian society ordered by harvest times and Christian holidays.
 For many of today's adult students, the semester just doesn't cut it. It's too long. Work schedules and childcare obligations can't be predicted. Campus is too far away.
 ''For years,'' says William J. Husson, vice president for professional studies and strategic alliances at Regis University in Denver, ''older adults were excluded from higher education unless they wanted to cram into desks that didn't fit or take time off from work.''
 Now they can have it their way. And with the adult student population accounting for some 40 percent of the higher education market, institutions compete to give it to them. Course length, class schedules, meeting venues, online components -- colleges now tweak them all to marry convenience and speed. 
 Dorothy Durkin, associate dean of the School of Continuing and Professional Studies at New York University, calls these new formats ''pain relievers.'' The evolving array is rapidly becoming the norm, but whether the new timetables actually do their job remains an open question. Some educators maintain that repackaging a semester's worth of curriculum into more palatable chunks compromises learning, that an eight-week course is too fast and too intense. Others say compressing the schedule increases the chance that adult students will take and pass classes, and complete a program of study.
 In either case, adults going back to school have to make decisions that never occurred to earlier generations: accelerated or compressed, blended or online? And if they can't decide, there's a format for that, too. 
 The Short Course Accelerated: The term is thrown about liberally but typically means 20 to 32 hours of class time over 4 to 10 weeks. Compressed: Not to be confused with the above; 40 to 45 hours (the same as a traditional semester) over six to eight weeks. Also called ''intensive.''
 ADULT learning resembles running the Boston Marathon, says Christopher E. Hopey, dean of the School of Professional and Continuing Studies at Northeastern University. Many may enter, he says, ''but when you get to Heartbreak Hill, your legs go out.'' To help adults get to the finish line -- a degree -- he advocates shortening the route and speeding up the pace. Northeastern typically splits the traditional semester in half for about 300 for-credit courses, which are offered eight times a year.
 Really in a hurry? Students in Northeastern's school of education can rack up a full semester's class time in just five days. New York University, too, offers for-credit courses that last a week in subjects like languages, digital arts and finance.
 Some institutions collapse two complementary courses into one. Oakton Community College, in the Chicago suburbs, may combine an English class with one in library science, or a theater course with one in psychology, and bundle them into 16-week or 8-week sessions. That's credit for two courses in half the time -- or, in the second case, a quarter of it.
 Mr. Hopey says the strategy, employed at Northeastern for a semester-long Econ I and II combo, eliminates redundancies. And students don't risk forgetting the fundamentals they learned in the first part while waiting for the second.
 But does any of it stick? Research on the effectiveness of various course formats is slim. In two small studies, Raymond Wlodkowski, former director of the Center for the Study of Accelerated Learning at Regis, concluded that adults in accelerated courses learned as well as or better than college-age students in traditional-length courses. 
 In one study, Dr. Wlodkowski followed 66 adults enrolled in accelerated courses (20 hours over five weeks) at three different colleges and 66 younger students taking the full-length versions (40 hours over 16 weeks). The accelerated and standard courses -- in accounting, business law and introductory philosophy -- both used identical materials, covered the same ground and were taught by the same instructors. At the end, each set of students was asked to write case-study analyses, which were evaluated by other experts. Scores earned by the adults either matched or exceeded those of the full-term students; when the study was repeated at different colleges, accelerated students did even better.
 With age often comes motivation, concentration, self-direction and work experience, Dr. Wlodkowski says. He adds that when those factors are found in a classroom environment, a full semester is usually unnecessary.
 Proponents insist that nothing of value is dropped because of the speed; instructors try to run more disciplined classrooms, present material more efficiently and make more pointed assignments. In the Regis studies, instructors reported that 80 percent of the content and methodology of the accelerated classes overlapped with traditional classes. Some class discussion, repetitive activities and practice time were eliminated.
 ''It brings us back to a fundamental question,'' Dr. Wlodkowski says. ''What does it take for people to learn something? There is no study in the world that says you learn more after doing, say, two papers on a subject instead of one.''
 But critics worry that the speed of these courses promotes haste and cramming and that their content is not as rich. Michael Slavkin, a professor at the University of Southern Indiana and an educational psychology researcher, does not recommend accelerated programs. He says people retain information when it is transferred in meaningful ways -- associations must be made; hands-on activities must reinforce learning; discussion and opportunity for reflection must underpin teaching. All that, he says, takes time.
 ''The brain is flexible, but it's not a supercomputer,'' Dr. Slavkin says. ''People need time to think through information. We're already talking about a population that is rushed and hurried. Frantically trying to get through assignments makes it more difficult for it to be a powerful learning experience.'' These courses exist, he says, to exploit a ready audience. They may be ''user-friendly,'' he says, but do they provide a good education?
 In part, that depends on the institution, says Daniel W. Shannon, dean of the Graham School of General Studies at the University of Chicago. ''Academic values vary between schools,'' he says, and students have differing expectations. Some do want ''continuing ed lite,'' he says. As a result, adult education remains a buyer-beware industry. The University of Phoenix, a pioneer in accelerated and compressed online degrees for midcareer adults, has been widely criticized for racing students through and for its low graduation rates.
 Some subjects, Dr. Shannon says, do not adapt well to an accelerated pace. A compressed language program that runs daily for three weeks in a row could result in a positive learning experience, he says. But truncating a language translation course would be a mistake, he adds, because the course is (or should be) labor intensive.
 There are no absolutes about which subjects work best. Those that require repetitive exercises, like science courses with lab work or math, demand much from students on a shortened schedule. And teaching such courses can be challenging as well. As for literature and survey courses, their heavy reading and writing loads usually require the processing time of a traditional semester.
 The most popular accelerated programs are in business, education and health care, because so many adults return to school to build their careers in these areas. In such well-defined fields, the curriculums work because they are career-specific; often, they are based on industry needs or business training models that have trickled into higher ed.
 Choose Your Online Exposure
 Blended: A mix of class meetings and online home instruction. Also called ''hybrid programs.'' Low Residency: A detailed online curriculum done from home between short but concentrated campus visits. No Residency: No campus attendance. Usually refers to online degree programs at bricks-and-mortar institutions. 
 COLLEGES continue to experiment. Some alternate on-site and online lessons; some hold classes completely online. At Lakeland College, which has several centers around Wisconsin, you don't have to decide: courses are held in a classroom as well as online -- and you can attend either way on any given day without even telling the instructor in advance.
 In something Lakeland calls BlendEd, students can do the lesson via the Internet (through a text seminar and online chat) or show up for class. About half usually do attend in person. Lakeland offers some 680 courses this way. The program, three years old, has cut attrition by 25 percent among students in its Kellett School of Adult Education. Students like it, says Stephen Gould, president of Lakeland, because they can stay home with sick children and still attend class, or log in from distant points while traveling on business.
 How much Web-based learning to add to your course schedule? Research supports having at least some. The University of Central Florida in Orlando started tracking performance in face-to-face, blended and online courses 12 years ago. From 1997 to 2003, researchers looked at the ''success rates'' (defined as a grade of C or better) of more than 100,000 students. They found that grades in the blended courses were comparable to and sometimes better than those in the other two formats.
 Another study, published in the Journal of Asynchronous Learning Networks, concluded that classes held solely online produced the most benefit. Dr. Slavkin's team at the University of Southern Indiana followed more than 400 students in six semesters of introductory courses in educational psychology and health care delivery systems. The same instructors taught the courses three different ways and found that students taking the courses online earned higher grades than those in both the traditional and blended classes. 
 Frank Mayadas, program director for the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which awards grants to colleges developing online learning, says many students learn better when they can review lessons and engage the material online, especially if they are intimidated by classroom participation. But the format can also prove frustrating to the technologically challenged.
 Dr. Slavkin says that online classes can confuse students who have poor organizational and technical skills and punish those with difficulties in written communication, given the frequent requirement for e-mailing and chatting with instructor and classmates.
 But the programs provide new possibilities. A ''low-residency'' degree program in law-firm management at George Washington University, for example, draws students from firms around the country; they travel to campus for brief periods of intense instruction, then complete the bulk of the work online. It kicks off with a nine-day on-site class that meets every day, including weekends, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Students get about 60 hours of class time and eat most meals together. Then they complete four months of online coursework from home. The program ends on campus, with a four-day residency.
 The Days of Rest
 Weekend University: Programs offered Friday night, Saturday and Sunday. The name says it all. For those too busy or tired during the week, there are even more opportunities to go to school.
 ENTIRE programs are tailored to the weekend. The Weekend University at the New Jersey Institute of Technology offers several degree programs, including a bachelor's in information technology and a master's in engineering management. Students meet Friday evenings or Saturdays for an hour and a half for 15 weeks; another hour and a half of class is completed online. Many of the courses are clustered into 24-credit professional certificates earned along the way.
 While the Weekend U. may be the new night school, Mr. Hopey says that Northeastern dropped such classes after a survey placed weekend courses ''at the bottom of the bottom'' of preferred activities. ''Maybe it's because people have great weekend opportunities in Boston,'' he says. 
 In contrast, at the University of Pennsylvania, where he was vice dean of education, ''We'd run one of those things, and 1,000 people would show up.''

HEADLINE: Wireless Workplaces, Touching the Sky

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE

 BODY:
THE Hearst Tower in Midtown Manhattan is known for its environmentally friendly features, along with its stunning design by the British architect Norman Foster. A distinctive triangular structure of glass and steel, it rises from the shell of the original six-story sandstone headquarters erected by William Randolph Hearst in 1928.
 But the tower -- which opened a year ago near Columbus Circle and received a ''gold'' certification for sustainability from the United States Green Building Council -- is also one of the more technologically advanced office buildings in the country. Almost everything is automated, from the lighting to the two-story waterfall in the lobby. Employees and visitors can also use their cellphones, BlackBerrys and wireless laptops anywhere in the building's 46 floors, including the lobby and cafe. Employees have access to all the applications and network services they would have if they were sitting at their desks. 
 At first glance, that may not seem a big deal. Yet in many office towers -- as many people who've tried to get a cellphone signal on upper floors can attest -- heavy construction materials impede radio frequency signals, resulting in weak signal coverage in parts or all of a building. To compensate, many buildings have sprouted a costly tangle of antennas and cables for the various devices, which use different wireless technology standards and spectrum bands. But that can create interference and the headache of installing cables and antenna for each new service. 
 Charles Montplaisir, the vice president for information systems at the Hearst Corporation, said wireless access was an important design point from the beginning. ''I couldn't imagine building a building today without a fully ubiquitous wireless network,'' he said. 
 A growing number of other companies and organizations appear to agree. Wireless connectivity has become a must-have amenity for businesses, hotels, hospitals, sporting arenas and other public and private buildings.
 ''Wireless is the way things are moving,'' said Mark Feller, the vice president for technology for the Arizona Cardinals of the National Football League. The new stadium for the team, which opened in 2006 and has a retractable roof and a grass field that can be rolled outdoors, provides cellular coverage for fans at the games. Wireless connectivity is also a selling point for trade shows and other events held there.
 This high-tech trend, experts say, reflects an increasingly mobile work force as well as consumers' expectations that their cellphones and other wireless devices will work everywhere. 
 And since the 9/11 attacks, attention has focused on the crucial role of wireless networks in public safety and emergency response. In New York City, a high-bandwidth public safety network is being deployed for emergency responders like police officers and firefighters. 
 The global market for so-called in-building wireless systems that use cables, antennas and amplifiers to carry wireless signals throughout a building is expected to be more than $3.6 billion by 2011, according to ABI Research, a market research company in Oyster Bay, N.Y. Much of the growth, said Dan Shey, an analyst at ABI, is coming from wireless systems that are not exclusive to one cellular or wireless service provider but allow many services to plug into a common infrastructure. 
 In Hearst's case, a Universal Wireless Network system from MobileAccess, based in Vienna, Va., collects cellular signals from three major carriers -- AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon, which have base stations in the building -- as well as signals from the building's Wi-Fi network, used for laptop computers. These radio frequency signals are converted to light and run up to each floor on a common fiber optic network; they are converted back to signals through eight antennas distributed on each floor. Outgoing signals operate in reverse. 
 For media companies, whose products are increasingly delivered in digital form, wireless is a natural. But wireless technology is also transforming businesses in all sorts of industries, from hotels to government agencies to health care companies. 
 In health care, for example, equipment like X-ray machines and intravenous pumps now come with built-in wireless communications connection. A band of spectrum called Wireless Medical Telemetry Service is dedicated to wireless medical devices. That has led to new applications from digital X-ray imaging and transmission to wireless monitoring of patients. 
 ''Wireless networks that integrate digital data are a fundamental part of the infrastructure of health care,'' said Timothy R. Zoph, vice president for information services and chief information officer at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. Last month, the hospital opened the one-million-square-foot Prentice Women's Hospital, where all the nurses wear wireless devices, thus keeping their hands free, and visitors are encouraged to use their cellphones and laptops. 
 In-building wireless systems can make economic sense. Employee productivity can be increased by as much as 30 percent, according to the In-Building Wireless Association, a trade group that includes Sprint, LGC Wireless, Motorola and PRTM Consulting. While the systems cost from 50 cents to $1.50 a square foot, a common wireless infrastructure can save tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in cable material and installation costs, according to companies that have installed them. Mr. Zoph of Northwestern Memorial estimated that the hospital saved $750,000 in such costs. 
 In addition, these systems make managing and upgrading wireless networks easier, saving on maintenance costs. 
 For Hearst, adding a new network service -- like the more powerful Wi-Fi technology known as 802.11n, which is planned for next year -- just requires plugging a component into the existing system, rather than stringing new cable, opening ceilings and adding antennas. ''It's easy for us to upgrade now,'' said Brian Schwagerl, the vice president for real estate at Hearst, whose publications include Cosmopolitan, Esquire and Good Housekeeping. ''This is where corporations are moving in the technology age.''
 Such flexibility can be important when technology is evolving at such a dizzying pace. In the next few years, experts say, several commercial developments are expected to include a broad range of wireless technology and applications for consumers and businesses. WiMax, a wireless technology that allows Internet and other connections across much broader areas than Wi-Fi, will hit the market next year, they say.
 New public safety networks, including the one in New York, are being prepared as well, and in January, the Federal Communications Commission plans to auction highly coveted wireless spectrum. The auction is drawing interest from players outside the traditional realm of telecommunications, like Google, which has ambitions to develop location-based applications for cellphones and mobile devices.
 At the Hearst Tower, like other high-tech corporate headquarters, people can be seen conducting business around the building with laptops, cellphones and other gadgets. Mr. Schwagerl notes that William Randolph Hearst, the company's founder, always intended to add on to the original six-story building. ''Is this what the old man envisioned?'' he said. ''I don't think so. But I think he'd be extremely gratified.''

HEADLINE: Two Necessary Bond Issues

 BODY:
These are not the best of times, fiscally speaking, in the great state of New Jersey. Years of irresponsible borrowing by legislators and governors of both political parties have confronted the state with billions and billions of dollars of debt. Unfunded pension costs alone are estimated to be more than $50 billion. 
 Even so, we urge voters to approve two major bond issues on their Election Day ballots. One would authorize the borrowing of $200 million to save some of what's left of the state's rapidly diminishing open space. The other would permit borrowing $450 million for stem cell research that, sadly, President Bush has prohibited the federal government from financing. 
 Of course we have misgivings. The state is in a terrible financial bind, which Gov. Jon Corzine, if not many of the legislators, freely acknowledges. But the open space and stem cells proposals address needs so compelling that they cannot be ignored. 
 The open space proposal is urgent. The state cannot postpone acquiring open space because in a few years there will be almost none left to buy. The stem cell proposal touches a moral issue. It is simply unconscionable not to provide money to study the possibility that embryonic stem cells could lead to cures for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, spinal injuries and other afflictions. With right-wing politics, abortion foes and religious zealots having successfully pressured the Bush administration not to underwrite research, states like California and New Jersey have no choice but to pick up some of the burden. 
 The open space bond issue is a watered-down version of an excellent proposal that would have authorized the state to borrow $175 million a year for the next decade to continue its highly successful -- and popular -- program for acquiring undeveloped land. Mr. Corzine blocked that plan, not because he did not like it, but because he wanted to straighten out the state's fiscal mess first. He decided instead on a one-year, $200 million borrowing proposal as a stopgap. 
 Conservation issues aside, there is a sound fiscal reason for voters to approve it. Because of the housing slump, land prices have sunk. Many developers are facing cash-flow problems and may be willing to sell some of their land to the state at bargain prices. That opportunity will evaporate as the housing market rebounds. 
 The $450 million stem cell bond issue would be in addition to $270 million in borrowing, authorized by voters last year, for new stem cell facilities and work in New Brunswick, Newark, Camden, Allendale and Belleville. The new money would provide $45 million a year for 10 years to support the actual work of the scientists.
 In a perfect world, the Legislature would provide this money on a year-to-year basis, as operating funds should be. But the upside of a bond issue is that it ensures that the research will continue, rather than be subject to the whimsy of Trenton's politicians. 
 Voters should also bear in mind that approval of the bond issue is likely to provide a huge shot in the arm for the state's economy. A study by Professor Joseph Seneca of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers estimated that the state could gain more than $2 billion in economic benefits from its investment and 30,000 new jobs -- many of them of the high-paying variety that New Jersey has been losing. 
 There is one ballot proposal that is manifestly a bad idea. Last year, voters set aside half the proceeds of the one-cent increase in the state's sales tax for local property tax relief. This year's proposal would dedicate all of the proceeds to property tax relief. 
 This is the sort of thing the politicians in Trenton love: it looks as if they are doing something to solve a major problem -- in this case high property taxes -- when in fact they are doing nothing. It does not take a genius to figure out that if the state takes money from its budget to pay for local property tax relief, it is simply robbing Peter to pay Paul.
 To his credit, Governor Corzine has already warned that the state could face a budget gap as large as $3.5 billion next year. If approved by voters, this ballot question would only make things worse.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 18, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An editorial on Nov. 4 wrongly stated that voters authorized borrowing $270 million last year for new stem cell facilities. The Legislature authorized the borrowing.

HEADLINE: Economic Growth, Clad in Military Garb

BYLINE: By STEPHEN KOTKIN

 BODY:
PAKISTAN'S recently re-elected leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, has indicated that he might finally heed the calls for him to step down as head of the army. But even if the general becomes a civilian president, that will not take the uniform off Pakistan's economy.
 A strategic country with nuclear weapons and suicide bombers, Pakistan also merits attention for economic lessons. From 1950 to 2000, its per capita income tripled, making it something of a middle-income country. But social indicators like infant mortality and literacy remain at the world's lower end. A few hundred intertwined families, many rooted in the military, maintain an anti-development chokehold on the country's wealth and political system. 
 ''Why some militaries become key players in a country's power politics is an issue that has puzzled many,'' writes the Pakistani analyst Ayesha Siddiqa in ''Military Inc.'' (Pluto, $35). Her answer is that the brass is protecting its gold.
 A military industrial complex can form a part of a regular economy, as in the United States or Britain, she says, but in some places, like Indonesia or Pakistan, military business operates in the shadows, broadly distorting values. Ms. Siddiqa uses the term ''Milbus'' to refer to ''military capital that is used for the personal benefit of the military fraternity, especially the officer cadre, but is neither recorded nor part of the defense budget.'' 
 Her book, while dense and full of jargon, offers a detailed and powerful case study of a global phenomenon: hollow economic growth. 
 Ms. Siddiqa's empirical riches on Milbus were not easy to come by. Some were extracted by Pakistan's parliamentary opposition after 2002; some she culled from official reports. (President Musharraf, she writes, has disclosed more than $10 million in real estate assets.) She also conducted interviews and has relied on Pakistani journalists' muckraking.
 Even if her ''rough figure'' for the overall scale of Milbus (about $:10 billion, or $20.7 billion) and her accounts of specific examples prove in need of revision, Ms. Siddiqa has dared to illuminate Pakistan's military as an oppressive holding company possessing not just security-related businesses, but also hotels, shopping malls, insurance companies, banks, farms and an airline. 
 How did Pakistan's armed forces end up dominating the economy? Awarding land grants to soldiers dates back to the aftermath of the 1857 mutiny against British colonial rule. After 1947, when Britain departed and Pakistan separated bloodily from India, the perceived external threat from India, and the dispute over the province of Kashmir (left unresolved by the British), kept the military front and center in Pakistan. 
 Distrustful military men sought to ensure their institution's financial autonomy, Ms. Siddiqa argues; then they sought direct control over policy making. In the bargain, they enriched themselves. 
 Post-independence expansion of Milbus occurred most prominently via welfare foundations, under the guise of providing for the needs of the troops and their families, whether with bakeries or beauty parlors. In addition, land grants, pensions five times the civilian level and post-retirement jobs -- ''the most significant group involved in Milbus are retired personnel'' -- were designed to make service attractive. But Ms. Siddiqa writes that ''out of the 46 housing schemes directly built by the armed forces, none is for ordinary soldiers.'' Milbus acts like an upward funnel.
 Milbus justifies its commercial empire by disparaging civilians as incompetent and corrupt and insisting that the military alone promote national development. Just such a developmental apology for Pakistan's military rule was echoed in American academic and policy circles throughout the cold war.
 To refute these claims, which endure among Pakistan's officer corps, Ms. Siddiqa tallies the bailouts for military-run businesses. When Milbus earns profits, Ms. Siddiqa writes, they often derive from insider access to resources and contracts. A number of top military companies, she shows, were granted outright monopolies, which wiped out competitive civilian companies. Milbus displays all the inefficiencies of crony capitalism, worsened by the military hierarchy. 
 Economic predation by the Pakistani military, she writes, finds an enabler in the nation's alliance with Washington, lately in the name of the war on terror. But she directs her deepest ire at Pakistan's civilian politicians, many of whom, she writes, have colluded in Milbus, profiting politically and commercially. 
 She writes about what she views as appeasement of Milbus in actions of two rival civilian prime ministers. Later, they were exiled. One, Nawaz Sharif, was recently deported when he tried to return to Pakistan, and the other, Benazir Bhutto, was just allowed back in a tenuous deal.
 By way of possible remedy, Ms. Siddiqa calls for the unity of Pakistan's opposition parties, long a chimerical pursuit, and for a mass mobilization to democratize the political system. In fact, she writes that the military might be viewed as Pakistan's largest political party, an all-volunteer force recruited primarily from the lower middle class. And she also notes that in China from the late 1990s, it was not democratic mobilization, but the autocratic Communist Party leadership that compelled the Chinese military to divest much of its vast economic holdings. 
 Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the leader of the Muslim League in British India, helped establish Pakistan as a separate state for Muslims (not an Islamic state). He insisted that ''the future of our state will and must depend greatly on the type of education we give to our children.'' He was right. But education in Pakistan turned out to be elitist to an extreme, and steeped in national security demonologies, which helped deliver the nation into military hands. The upshot has been not just political instability, but also economic growth without development.

HEADLINE: No More Mayor Chicken Little

 BODY:
Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who administered tough medicine and nursed the city back to fiscal health after he took office in 2002, has been warning that another economic cooling is around the corner. Few people have paid real attention, though, and it's not hard to see why. Despite the mayor's predictions, year after recent year -- helped along in a big way by the real estate market -- the city has registered billions of dollars in surpluses, $4.4 billion in the last fiscal year alone. No longer. 
 The city has revised downward its estimates on revenues for the next two years. The budget next year is projected to have a shortfall of $2.7 billion, rising by 2011 to $6.5 billion. It's the kind of dire scenario that brings out the best in Mr. Bloomberg, who seems born to the role of fiscal savior.
 As if to demonstrate that this time he's really serious, the mayor ordered agencies citywide to find spending cuts totaling 7.5 percent in the next two years, or about $1.5 billion -- the first time that's been done since 2002, when cuts were made necessary by a recession. And except for essential services, like fire and police, new hiring has been frozen for now.
 Mr. Bloomberg's warning is pointed and timely. While there is no recession, economic growth has slowed appreciably. Housing foreclosures are up, and the land-rush fever that overtook Manhattan and gentrified neighborhoods in all the boroughs shows signs of having peaked, at least for now. Those sales produced essential taxes, including taxes that help fund public transportation. If budget officials are right, New York will collect about $250 million less than it had anticipated from real estate transactions this year. .
 Hotel and sales tax receipts are up, a reminder of why New York loves its tourists and business travelers. But personal income tax and business revenues for the current fiscal year are also expected to tumble, by about $100 million. 
 The state comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, added to the bad news with his forecast last week that Wall Street bonuses this year will be down about 10 percent. That may not sound like much, especially considering that those bonuses last year reached nearly $24 billion. But the loss represents tens of millions of dollars in tax revenue that won't materialize. And that understandably upsets Mr. Bloomberg and Christine Quinn, who leads the City Council, which must give its approval to any proposed budget cuts.
 Ms. Quinn, who has generally been in sync with Mr. Bloomberg on budget matters, has had good words to say for the mayor's cautionary actions. More than a few other council members, however, will need persuading.
 The city's woes, of course, are not isolated, and that further exacerbates the problem. Albany and Washington, which take from New York much more than they give in the best of circumstances, cannot be counted on for any significant additional help. If a fiscal hole opens up, the city will have to dig itself out. Mr. Bloomberg's warning should command everyone's attention.

HEADLINE: Noun + Verb + 9/11 + Iran = Democrats' Defeat?

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
WHEN President Bush started making noises about World War III, he only confirmed what has been a Democratic article of faith all year: Between now and Election Day he and Dick Cheney, cheered on by the mob of neocon dead-enders, are going to bomb Iran. 
 But what happens if President Bush does not bomb Iran? That is good news for the world, but potentially terrible news for the Democrats. If we do go to war in Iran, the election will indeed be a referendum on the results, which the Republican Party will own no matter whom it nominates for president. But if we don't, the Democratic standard-bearer will have to take a clear stand on the defining issue of the race. As we saw once again at Tuesday night's debate, the front-runner, Hillary Clinton, does not have one. 
 The reason so many Democrats believe war with Iran is inevitable, of course, is that the administration is so flagrantly rerunning the sales campaign that gave us Iraq. The same old scare tactic -- a Middle East Hitler plotting a nuclear holocaust -- has been recycled with a fresh arsenal of hyped, loosey-goosey intelligence and outright falsehoods that are sometimes regurgitated without corroboration by the press. 
 Mr. Bush has gone so far as to accuse Iran of shipping arms to its Sunni antagonists in the Taliban, a stretch Newsweek finally slapped down last week. Back in the reality-based community, it is Mr. Bush who has most conspicuously enabled the Taliban's resurgence by dropping the ball as it regrouped in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Administration policy also opened the door to Iran's lethal involvement in Iraq. The Iraqi ''unity government'' that our troops are dying to prop up has more allies in its Shiite counterpart in Tehran than it does in Washington. 
 Yet 2002 history may not literally repeat itself. Mr. Cheney doesn't necessarily rule in the post-Rumsfeld second Bush term. There are saner military minds afoot now: the defense secretary Robert Gates, the Joint Chiefs chairman Mike Mullen, the Central Command chief William Fallon. They know that a clean, surgical military strike at Iran could precipitate even more blowback than our ''cakewalk'' in Iraq. The Economist tallied up the risks of a potential Shock and Awe II this summer: ''Iran could fire hundreds of missiles at Israel, attack American forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, organize terrorist attacks in the West or choke off tanker traffic through the Strait of Hormuz, the world's oil windpipe.'' 
 Then there's the really bad news. Much as Iraq distracted America from the war against Al Qaeda, so a strike on Iran could ignite Pakistan, Al Qaeda's thriving base and the actual central front of the war on terror. As Joe Biden said Tuesday night, if we attack Iran to stop it from obtaining a few kilograms of highly enriched uranium, we risk facilitating the fall of the teetering Musharraf government and the unleashing of Pakistan's already good-to-go nuclear arsenal on Israel and India.
 A full-scale regional war, chaos in the oil market, an overstretched American military pushed past the brink -- all to take down a little thug like Ahmadinejad (who isn't even Iran's primary leader) and a state, however truculent, whose defense budget is less than 1 percent of America's? Call me a Pollyanna, but I don't think even the Bush administration can be this crazy. 
 Yet there is nonetheless a method to all the mad threats of war coming out of the White House. While the saber- rattling is reckless as foreign policy, it's a proven winner as election-year Republican campaign strategy. The real point may be less to intimidate Iranians than to frighten Americans. Fear, the only remaining card this administration still knows how to play, may once more give a seemingly spent G.O.P. a crack at the White House in 2008. 
 Whatever happens in or to Iran, the American public will be carpet-bombed by apocalyptic propaganda for the 12 months to come. Mr. Bush has nothing to lose by once again using the specter of war to pillory the Democrats as soft on national security. The question for the Democrats is whether they'll walk once more into this trap.
 You'd think the same tired tactics wouldn't work again after Iraq, a debacle now soundly rejected by a lopsided majority of voters. But even a lame-duck president can effectively wield the power of the bully pulpit. From Mr. Bush's surge speech in January to Gen. David Petraeus's Congressional testimony in September, the pivot toward Iran has been relentless. 
 Reinforcements are arriving daily. Dan Senor, the former flack for L. Paul Bremer in Baghdad, fronted a recent Fox News special, ''Iran: The Ticking Bomb,'' a perfect accompaniment to the Rudy Giuliani campaign that is ubiquitous on that Murdoch channel. The former Bush flack Ari Fleischer is a founder of Freedom's Watch, a neocon fat-cat fund that has been spending $15 million for ads supporting the surge and is poised to up the ante for Iran war fever.
 There are signs that the steady invocation of new mushroom clouds is already having an impact as it did in 2002 and 2003. A Zogby poll last month found that a majority of Americans (52 percent) now supports a pre-emptive strike on Iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons.
 In 2002 Senators Clinton, Biden, John Kerry, John Edwards and Chris Dodd all looked over their shoulders at such polls. They and the party's Congressional leaders, Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt, voted for the Iraq war resolution out of the cynical calculation that it would inoculate them against charges of wussiness. Sure, they had their caveats at the time. They talked about wanting ''to give diplomacy the best possible opportunity'' (as Mr. Gephardt put it then). In her Oct. 10, 2002, speech of support for the Iraq resolution on the Senate floor, Mrs. Clinton hedged by saying, ''A vote for it is not a vote to rush to war.''
 We know how smart this strategic positioning turned out to be. Weeks later the Democrats lost the Senate.
 This time around, with the exception of Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidates seem to be saying what they really believe rather than trying to play both sides against the middle. Only Mrs. Clinton voted for this fall's nonbinding Kyl-Lieberman Senate resolution, designed by its hawk authors to validate Mr. Bush's Iran policy. The House isn't even going to bring up this malevolent bill because, as Nancy Pelosi has said, there has ''never been a declaration by a Congress before in our history'' that ''declared a piece of a country's army to be a terrorist organization.'' 
 In 2002, the Iraq war resolution passed by 77 to 23. In 2007, Kyl-Lieberman passed by 76 to 22. No sooner did Mrs. Clinton cast her vote than she started taking heat in Iowa. Her response was to blur her stand. She abruptly signed on as the sole co- sponsor of a six-month-old (and languishing) bill introduced by the Virginia Democrat Jim Webb forbidding money for military operations in Iran without Congressional approval. 
 In Tuesday's debate Mrs. Clinton tried to play down her vote for Kyl-Lieberman again by incessantly repeating her belief in ''vigorous diplomacy'' as well as the same sound bite she used after her Iraq vote five years ago. ''I am not in favor of this rush for war,'' she said, ''but I'm also not in favor of doing nothing.''
 Much like her now notorious effort to fudge her stand on Eliot Spitzer's driver's license program for illegal immigrants, this is a profile in vacillation. And this time Mrs. Clinton's straddling stood out as it didn't in 2002. That's not because she was the only woman on stage but because she is the only Democratic candidate who has not said a firm no to Bush policy. 
 That leaves her in a no man's -- or woman's -- land. If Mr. Bush actually does make a strike against Iran, Mrs. Clinton will be the only leading Democrat to have played a cameo role in enabling it. If he doesn't, she can no longer be arguing in the campaign crunch of fall 2008 that she is against rushing to war, because it would no longer be a rush. Her hand would be forced.
 Mr. Biden got a well-deserved laugh Tuesday night when he said there are only three things in a Giuliani sentence: ''a noun and a verb and 9/11.'' But a year from now, after the public has been worn down by so many months more of effective White House propaganda, ''America's mayor'' (or any of his similarly bellicose Republican rivals) will be offering voters the clearest possible choice, however perilous, about America's future in the world. 
 Potentially facing that Republican may be a Democrat who is not in favor of rushing to war in Iran but, now as in 2002, may well be in favor of walking to war. In any event, she will not have been a leader in making the strenuous case for an alternative policy that defuses rather than escalates tensions with Tehran.
 Noun + verb + 9/11 -- also Mr. Bush's strategy in 2004, lest we forget -- would once again square off against a Democratic opponent who was for a pre-emptive war before being against it.

REVOLUTION OF HOPE 
 The Life, Faith, and Dreams of a Mexican President. 
 By Vicente Fox and Rob Allyn. 
 Illustrated. 375 pp. Viking. $27.95.
 God is about the only thing that evokes more reverence from the average Mexican than the concept of revolution.
 The country's last one, from 1910 to 1920, took a staggering toll, including an estimated one million people dead. But it also started the country's poor masses dreaming of democracy. What they got instead was a cruel hoax by a political system that took on a revolutionary name and kept up the old dictatorial ways. In more than seven decades in power, the Institutional Revolutionary Party used repressive tactics to stamp out much of the people's will to fight. It did not, however, extinguish their dream. So when a strapping, charismatic farmer and onetime Coca-Cola executive strode onto the national political stage, wearing work clothes, waving the banner of Mexico's patron saint and promising those who followed him a peaceful revolution, the response was overwhelming. Upon his election in 2000, Vicente Fox promised Mexicans something they thought impossible: change. And he told them what that change would look like: dramatic economic growth, a million new jobs a year, clean cops, honest public servants, a free press and a relationship of mutual respect with the United States. 
 When Fox left office in 2006, Mexico was no worse off than it had been before he came to power. But it wasn't significantly better either. The economy was stable, but the United States Border Patrol reported ever more Mexicans risking their lives to migrate illegally to America. A number of drug kingpins went to jail, but the fighting among their lieutenants started a devastating crime wave. The press was free to expose corruption, but courts remained too weak to combat it. 
 While Mexico got Washington to participate in talks on sweeping immigration reform, Congress adopted plans to build a wall at the border instead. And rather than uphold the fragile electoral rules that had allowed his own rise to power, Fox resorted to some of the very same undemocratic practices of the party he had ousted, using the powers of his office to help his chosen candidate succeed him.
 His time as president seemed so bewildering a free fall that even political analysts who supported him struggled to explain what had gone wrong. In his new book, ''Revolution of Hope,'' Fox does not offer much insight. Written with the help of his longtime American political adviser, Rob Allyn, the book is a lot like Fox's presidency -- long on promises, short on substance. It offers colorful accounts of Fox's childhood and of his presidential travels, but gives only shallow treatment to the forces that blocked him from implementing the reforms that are crucial to making Mexico a full democracy.
 The English edition of the book is appearing a month before the Spanish one, which will undoubtedly raise questions south of the border, where Fox was often accused of pandering to the United States. Pandering, however, can be the first step of a sales pitch. And now that he's sold Mexico on change, Fox wants to sell the United States on a new relationship with Mexico.
 Fox has long believed that one of the best ways to help Mexico is to educate the United States about the importance of improving relations with it. Americans may not know what they want to do about their country's complex immigration problems. But all polls indicate they want to do something. Persuading them to move away from building walls and toward building a North American Union modeled after Europe is a long shot. But Fox learned, when he overturned the entrenched system to win the presidency, not to rule out long shots.
 Sermons about the benefits of free trade and the nobility of Mexican migrants run through just about every chapter of the book, whether Fox is writing about crossing the border with his brother to sell vegetables in McAllen, Tex., sipping wine at the governor's mansion with Arnold Schwarzenegger or bracing for the fallout of Sept. 11. 
 The terrorist attacks were as much a turning point for Fox's presidency as they were for George W. Bush's. Up to that day, the two presidents treated each other as close friends -- though Fox calls Bush a ''windshield cowboy'' who speaks ''grade-school-level'' Spanish, and adds that he was the ''cockiest'' man Fox had ever met -- and they agreed to begin work on reforms that would have given legal status to millions of Mexicans currently working in the United States. After that day, progress on the reforms pretty much ended, and Republicans killed any versions that made their way to Congress.
 Fox writes about how his relationship with Bush grew distant after the attacks and turned tense when it became clear that Mexico would not support a United Nations resolution authorizing the United States invasion of Iraq. However, in one telling -- some might say, pandering -- passage, he says there were good intentions behind Bush's wrongheaded ideas. 
 Fox decribes Bush as ''a loving Christian.'' And he writes: ''I am absolutely certain that George W. Bush did what he believed he had to do, in order to protect his country and the world from evil. ... The sad thing is that he was so deeply, deeply wrong.''

1-888-STA-AWAY
 Pesky telemarketers could start interrupting everyone's dinner once again unless federal lawmakers make the national Do Not Call Registry a permanent way to protect yourself against a maddening invasion of privacy.
 The program, started in 2003, let consumers opt out of receiving sales calls for five years, which means millions of Americans who signed up back then would be off the list come January. 
 But proposals in Congress would make the registry permanent so people don't have to worry about renewing. The Senate bill is co-sponsored by Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, and the House bill is sponsored by Mike Doyle, Democrat of Pennsylvania.
 In New York, 8.9 million telephone numbers are on the registry. In the mid-Hudson Valley, 614,598 numbers with the 845 area code are on the list. There are more than one million numbers on the registry from the regional 914 and 518 area codes.
 Companies can be fined up to $11,000 each time a number on the list is called. 
 Officials for the Federal Trade Commission say consumers who want to remain on the registry can just enroll again online at www.donotcall.gov or by calling the commission's hot line at (888) 382-1222.
 But Senator Schumer and other legislative sponsors argue consumers shouldn't have to go this far if they registered before. He's right.
 Congress should pass this legislation.

 No More Tuition Roulette
 If his testimony before a state Senate committee is any indication, the State University of New York's new chairman of the board of trustees can go a long way toward helping eradicate ''tuition roulette'': years of tuition freezes, followed by outlandish hikes. In 2003, for example, SUNY raised tuition a whopping 28 percent after eight years without an increase.
 SUNY should have a more rational tuition policy where increases are tied to an inflation index. That would give families a better idea of what tuition costs would be during a student's entire time in college. While former SUNY Chancellor John Ryan acknowledged the problem, he didn't do enough about it. 
 Elmira attorney Carl Hayden, Gov. Eliot Spitzer's choice to head the SUNY board of trustees, said the 64-campus system should moderately increase tuition each year, but also lock in four-year rates for each incoming class. That could encourage students to finish their bachelor's degree programs on time, since they would run the risk of a larger increase in the fifth year. SUNY wants to encourage on-time graduation, in part, because lengthy stays by students prevent potential openings in already crowded classrooms. While the latter incentive is understandable, many students take longer to finish college because they have to stop and work to afford tuition or because they are non-traditional students holding down full-time jobs and completing their education as time allows.
 The four-year rate may have merit but, at bare minimum, SUNY officials should limit the chances of dramatic tuition hikes by instituting incremental annual increases.
 They should keep in mind the state is facing a multimillion-dollar budget gap, has accrued more than $50 billion in debt and faces ''significant turbulence'' in the financial and housing markets, according to state Budget Director Paul Francis. Freezing tuition rates while increasing SUNY spending will be difficult, if not impossible, for the state to sustain, as students enrolling in 2003 found out the hard way. SUNY should learn from past mistakes.

 Who holds the world's oil? You might assume it's in the hands of big private oil companies like ExxonMobil. But in fact, 77 percent of the world's oil reserves are held by national oil companies with no private equity, and there are 13 state-owned oil companies with more reserves than ExxonMobil, the largest multinational oil company. The popular perception in the United States is that if leaders of oil countries nationalize their oil, they are bucking a global trend toward privatization. In reality, nationalized oil is the trend. And the percentage of oil controlled by state-owned companies is likely to continue rising, mainly because of the demographics of oil. Deposits are being exhausted in wealthy countries -- the ones that exploited their oil first and generally have the most private oil -- and are being found largely in developing countries, where oil tends to belong to the state. 
 Nationalization is also a political trend in some regions, mainly Latin America, where the populist presidents of Bolivia and Ecuador have made it part of their discourse. They are led, of course, by Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. He has made private producers accept state control of their operations. When they wouldn't, as in the case of ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, he simply nationalized their holdings. Chavez has also asserted his control over Venezuela's state oil company, which before him operated very much like a private, profit-driven enterprise. 
 Chavez is a prophet in search of disciples. He seeks to present Venezuela as a more moral world power, uniting Latin America and poor countries everywhere in a socialist alliance. He has invented a new kind of socialism, which he calls Bolivarian socialism, named for the independence hero Simon Bolivar: a little Marx, a little Jesus, a little anti-imperialism and a lot of the whim of Hugo Chavez, dedicated to the ''comprehensive, humanist, endogenous and socialist development of the nation.'' His is a gospel greased by oil, which is financing his transformation of Venezuela. Chavez is a genius of a politician: charming, folksy, flirtatious. I first met him in New York in 1999, the year he became president. I sat next to him at an interview, very pregnant. He embraced me -- ''But you should come have the baby in Venezuela!'' he enthused. 
 The appeal of his message transcends the charisma of the messenger. To other countries -- especially the oil and gas nations in Latin America that watch Chavez with particular interest -- the appeal is simple to understand. Oil- and gas-dependent countries are historically ill governed. Today their people are in rebellion against globalization, which promised much but has brought them little. They have been told their countries are rich, but they see they are poor. So someone must be stealing the profits. 
 Most often, nationalization is a reaction to the idea that the thief is a foreign company. For populist leftists, El Petroleo es Nuestro! -- the oil is ours -- is an alluring slogan. Now as the record high price of oil has made exploitation worthwhile even in places that are remote or geologically complicated (Chad comes to mind), more underdeveloped countries have to choose what to do with their oil. Those that have long held oil must decide how to spend the incomprehensible amounts of money oil is now bringing them. 
 Historically, almost every country dependent on the export of oil has answered this question in the same way: badly. It may seem paradoxical, but finding a hole in the ground that spouts money can be one of the worst things to happen to a nation. With one or two exceptions, oil-dependent countries are poorer, more conflict-ridden and despotic. OPEC's own studies show the perils of relying on oil. Between 1965 and 1998, the economies of OPEC members contracted by 1.3 percent a year. Oil-dependent nations do especially badly by their poor: infant survival, nutrition, life expectancy, literacy, schooling -- all are worse in oil-producing countries. The history of oil-dependent countries has produced what Terry Lynn Karl, a Stanford University professor, calls the paradox of plenty. 
 Oil not only creates very few jobs, it also destroys jobs in other sectors. By pushing up a country's exchange rate, the export of oil distorts the economy. ''Oil rents drive out any other productive activity,'' Karl says. ''Why would you bother to produce your own food if you could buy it? Why would you bother to develop any kind of export industry if oil makes your money worth more and that hurts all your other exports?'' The most successful societies develop a middle class through manufacturing; oil makes this extremely difficult. 
 Oil concentrates a country's wealth in the state, creating a culture where money is made by soliciting politicians and bureaucrats rather than by making things and selling them. Oil states also ask their citizens for little in taxes, and where citizens pay little in taxes, they demand little in accountability. Those in power distribute oil money to stay in power. Thus oil states tend to be highly corrupt.
 II.
 Venezuela is a typical victim of the oil curse. It has become a rich country of poor people. Teodoro Petkoff has seen Venezuela through booms and busts. Once a daring leftist guerrilla who in 2006 was briefly a candidate against Chavez, he publishes a newspaper, Tal Cual, that criticizes both Chavez and the opposition. ''The state is booty,'' Petkoff said when I met him in his small office in Caracas. ''The state is hypertrophic here, a monster complex on top of society, heavy and corrupt. It has been the great contractor, the great buyer, the great provider, the great receiver. To win government is to get access to a source of personal enrichment. Money has to pass through the state. Oil has weakened our collective morality. It obliges you to be corrupt. You can't do business if you are not corrupt. We are waiting for the easy deal, big winnings.'' 
 Chavez has promised to break this curse, to finally use Venezuela's oil to benefit its people. Oil is everything in Venezuela; it pays for at least half the government's expenditures and 90 percent of its foreign exchange, according Orlando Ochoa, a prominent economist. Now ''zero misery'' is one of the government's slogans, and the vehicle to get there is oil. Chavez's oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela S.A., or Pdvsa (pronounced peh-deh-VEH-sah -- S.A. stands for ''sociedad anonima,'' or incorporated), is proudly inefficient, proudly political. Chavez has called his revolution ''oil socialism.'' 
 ''We are doing what the old regimes didn't do,'' Bernardo Alvarez, Venezuela's ambassador to Washington and a former vice minister of hydrocarbons in the Ministry of Energy, said to me. ''We are putting oil into a sustained process of development. Our first priority is a fight against poverty and exclusion.'' 
 To that end, Pdvsa is investing the company's profits in helping dropouts finish high school and not just in drilling wells. ''Perhaps it was better run before Chavez,'' says Roger Tissot, a Latin America analyst based in British Columbia who works for PFC Energy. ''But it wasn't efficient in meeting the needs of the shareholders -- the people of Venezuela. Today perhaps it is less efficient but better at meeting social goals.''
 Whether this is the right decision turns on whether this policy is sustainable. In the 1990s, Venezuela's state oil company was a sleek machine, an excellent exploiter of oil, well fed on its own profits. It floated above society, unmoored from the problems of the average citizen. Today, oil money feeds and educates poor neighborhoods. The purpose of the national oil company is not to produce more oil, but to produce Bolivarian socialism. These are two very different ways to handle a nation's oil resource. Can either model show poor countries how to convert natural resources into sustained wealth? Few questions in economic policy are more important today. 
 III.
 Many nationalized oil companies are poorly managed -- on average, national companies are 65 percent as efficient as private ones, according to one study. Still, it is possible to have a stellar national oil company, efficient in the classic sense, one that can compete favorably with any Western major. Saudi Aramco and Petrobras, in Brazil, are two examples. But perhaps the best-run national oil company that ever existed was in Venezuela. It was Pdvsa.
 ''On Dec. 31, 1975, I went to sleep as an Exxon employee, and I woke up on Jan. 1, 1976, as an employee of Pdvsa,'' Antonio Szabo told me. Szabo now runs a software company in Houston, but until 1983, he was a high-level executive at Pdvsa. ''I went to the same office, same everything. It was a brilliantly executed nationalization process. What became different the next morning? Except for the destination of the revenues, nothing. Literally nothing. That was the whole point -- to continue to produce money for the country without disruption.'' 
 President Carlos Andres Perez nationalized Venezuela's oil because in the early 1970s there was an oil boom, with a barrel reaching $12 in 1974 (about $50 in today's dollars), having quadrupled from the $3 a barrel fetched in 1973. Venezuelans demanded that the profits stay at home. The expropriation of Exxon, Shell and Gulf was negotiated and seamless, the lack of acrimony stemming from the fact that the foreign companies' concessions had been designed from the start to be temporary, and were to expire in 1983. ''I believe that everybody realized Pdvsa was the goose that laid the golden egg,'' Szabo says. ''To keep it healthy you must leave it alone. Every president believed this was sound policy -- until Chavez.'' 
 Paradoxically, nationalization brought the government less money and less control. When Venezuela's oil was still in private hands, the government collected 80 cents of every dollar of oil exported. With nationalization the figure dropped, and by the early 1990s, the government was collecting roughly half that amount. This low return to the country's coffers was partly a result of that age-old conflict between short- and long-term reward. Because wells run dry and machinery ages, oil companies everywhere must invest lots of money just to keep production steady, and to grow, they need even more. Without new investment, Pdvsa would lose 25 percent of its oil production every year. Its officials were convinced that Venezuela benefited more if Pdvsa's profits went to producing more oil, not more government. ''Social revenue has always overshadowed investing in the industry,'' said Ramon Espinasa, who was chief economist of Pdvsa from 1992 to 1999. ''But I think the priority has to be to maintain oil. If you have one dollar left, it should be invested in keeping capacity. Otherwise next time around you will not have a single dollar to distribute.'' 
 Espinasa, now 55, lives in Washington and works as an energy consultant to the Inter-American Development Bank. As chief economist for Pdvsa, he was a persuasive voice for the strategy of ''oil first.'' During the early '90s, the company had an extraordinary need for investment. The bulk of Venezuela's oil lies under a 4,500-square-mile savanna called the Orinoco Belt. The reserves are enormous, but 20 years ago it was not clear that they would be commercially viable. The oil was heavy and extra-heavy crude, thick as Play-Doh. It required expensive technology and expertise to extract, and even then only a small percentage of the oil could be recovered. This crude also needed a special refining process and would most likely sell at a discount.
 To ensure there would be a market for Orinoco crude, in 1982 Pdvsa began to buy refineries overseas able to process it. Among its purchases was Citgo, the American refining and distribution network. By the end of the 1990s, Pdvsa was among the top three oil refiners in the U.S. ''With heavy oil, if you don't own a refinery, your production does not have a home,'' Szabo says. ''If you own a refinery, you have market share.'' And Pdvsa in the 1990s was focused on maximizing its market share in the United States. 
 Pdvsa executives also decided they didn't want to take on the debt and risk of developing the Orinoco, so in 1989 they began to open it to private participation. Pdvsa lowered the normal royalty rate of 16 percent to a mere 1 percent to attract investment to this capital-intensive project. The royalty was meant to jump to 16 percent once the private company had recouped a certain percentage of its investment. 
 In hindsight, these were brilliant business decisions. Pdvsa's refineries overseas are making record profits, and the United States is the company's biggest customer. But back then, the gathering of adequate revenue for the Venezuelan state did not figure highly among the company's priorities. The Orinoco contract, for example, was so generous that in 2004, with oil at $46 a barrel, the private oil companies were still paying royalties of 1 percent. (That year Chavez raised royalties to 16 percent by decree.)
 In fact, some of Pdvsa's shrewd business decisions seem to have been made with an eye to shielding its gains from the government. Pdvsa bought its first shares in an overseas oil refinery after the government seized its multibillion-dollar investment fund to help solve a financial crisis. Economists on the left who are critical of the old Pdvsa argue that the foreign holdings allowed the company to play with costs and profits. It could sell oil to its refineries at less than market price -- thus incurring lower taxes. 
 Pdvsa attracted the cream of Venezuela's professional class. Espinasa, who was educated at Cambridge, had an office full of young (and very well paid) Ivy League- and Oxbridge-educated Venezuelans. Pdvsa's resources and talent outshone that of the Energy Ministry, which was supposed to be overseeing it. ''In the 1990s most oil policy and macroeconomic policy for Venezuela was done inside Pdvsa,'' one Venezuelan economist told me. ''When the I.M.F. came to Venezuela, the meetings were done in the office of Espinasa. The figures they used came from Pdvsa and the Central Bank rather than the Finance Ministry.'' 
 Ambassador Alvarez was one of those trying to keep control over Pdvsa, first as head of the energy and mines committee in Congress, and later as vice minister of energy for hydrocarbons. ''At the ministry,'' Alvarez says, ''we had gone from 200 engineers to 25. Pdvsa was the only one that had cars, people. One energy minister used to call it 'the Empire.' '' 
 Pdvsa won virtually every argument. But many people, not just Chavistas, would argue that Venezuela lost. By 1998, real wages in Venezuela were less than 40 percent what they had been in 1980. A third of the country was living in extreme poverty -- up from 11 percent in 1984. ''It was normal for people working for Pdvsa to be very proud -- it was recognized as one of the best oil companies,'' says Tissot, the oil analyst. ''In contrast, the politicians were making a mess managing the rest of the country. Pdvsa was working, but Venezuela was not working.'' 
 I asked Espinasa to respond to the charge that his Pdvsa didn't do much for the average Venezuelan. 
 ''It shouldn't have,'' he replied. ''It was an oil company.'' 
 IV.
 Ten years later, Pdvsa is no longer an oil company, at least by Espinasa's standards. It now exists to finance Chavez's transformation of Venezuela. The integration is illustrated by the fact that Rafael Ramirez, the minister of energy and petroleum, is also president of Pdvsa. ''The Pdvsa that neglected the people and indifferently watched the misery and poverty in the communities surrounding the company premises is over,'' Ramirez has said. ''Now the oil industry takes concrete actions to deepen the revolutionary distributions of the revenues among the people.'' If the Pdvsa of the 1990s thought it was Exxon, today's Pdvsa amounts to the president's $35 billion petty-cash drawer. 
 Chavez travels a lot. Foreign presidents who receive him may enjoy receiving his customary gift -- a replica of the sword of Bolivar. But they probably appreciate even more the oil that sometimes comes with it. Chavez provides discounted or free oil to Central American and Caribbean countries, sending nearly 100,000 barrels a day to Cuba in exchange for doctors and Cuban expertise on state security. He has given millions in non-oil aid to various Latin American countries, much of it in the form of energy projects. Citgo says it gave $80 million in heating oil to poor residents of the South Bronx last winter. 
 Pdvsa is also subsidizing Venezuela's domestic oil consumption. Cheap oil for Venezuelans is nothing new; when President Perez tried to raise gasoline prices in 1989, the riots nearly toppled him. The Venezuelans feel it is their oil; why should they have to pay for it? But the subsidies are much deeper and the quantities greater today. A gallon of gasoline costs 6.3 cents at the pump at the unofficial exchange rate. And Venezuela is now gorging on gas. Venezuela will add 450,000 new cars this year -- about four times the number of four years ago. Six Hummer dealerships are set to open early next year. 
 Oil is now used to create electricity. Some of Venezuela's electric plants used to burn natural gas, but gas production has dropped, creating shortages that oil is filling. Domestic consumption of oil has reached at least 650,000 barrels a day, according to Venezuelan economists. Venezuela is importing oil products and may soon have to import gasoline. There is also the problem of contraband: subsidized gasoline smuggled out and sold at world-market prices in Colombia and the Caribbean. Between its domestic consumption and its use of oil to make friends overseas, Venezuela gives away or subsidizes a third of its production. Most of the rest is sold in the United States. 
 The money that Pdvsa does get from selling at market prices goes to finance Chavez's revolution at home. Last year, Pdvsa's payments to the state totaled more than $35 billion, counting taxes, royalties and direct support for social programs. This is 35 percent of the company's gross earnings. 
 Almost $14 billion is spent at the sole discretion of Chavez. It is called social-development money, although it appears that there is little ''social'' in some of its spending. Much of the money goes to the Fund for National Development, or Fonden, an off-budget fund controlled by Chavez, which also takes foreign reserves from the Central Bank. Fonden's Web site in July listed 130 projects -- infrastructure, foreign aid, some social projects like health clinics -- as well as the purchase of helicopters, submarine technology, assault rifles and plants to build other munitions. The list was taken off the Web site shortly after it drew notice in the press and was replaced by a list containing no arms purchases. What Fonden actually buys, for how much, from whom and through what process is a mystery. 
 The more celebrated of Pdvsa's projects is a network of social programs, called misiones. These missions bring health clinics and classrooms directly into poor neighborhoods. They are financed and in some cases run directly by Pdvsa. ''If Perez wanted money from his oil boom, he had to wait for Pdvsa to pay taxes, and he had to go to Congress and approve extraordinary spending,'' one Venezuelan economist told me. ''Today, the president gets on the phone with Ramirez and in an hour can get $200 million.'' 
 To finance all these ambitious projects, Pdvsa must produce oil. Theoretically this should not be a problem. When Chavez was elected, Venezuelan crude went for about $9 a barrel (about $11 today). At press time it was about $78. (Venezuela crude trades at slightly under the average OPEC crude price.) Chavez is the beneficiary of the greatest oil windfall the world has seen, one based in part on political upheaval in Iran, Iraq and Nigeria but also on a surge in demand from China and India that is unlikely to end soon. So, for the foreseeable future, there should be money for everything.
 Yet Pdvsa is in trouble. 
 V.
 One good way to see Pdvsa's many challenges up close is to look at the mystery of the missing drilling rigs. A rig has two jobs: to drill down in auspicious spots to look for oil, and to clear out working wells when they clog, like a giant Roto-Rooter. Because oil is so profitable and people are drilling madly, there is a global shortage of rigs, and the price of renting them has gone up. But Venezuela's shortage is worse than elsewhere. In testimony before the National Assembly in July, Luis Vierma, Pdvsa's vice president for production, called the rig shortage ''a significant operational emergency.'' The country needs 191 this year to meet its production goals, Vierma said. But according to Baker Hughes, the Houston firm that provides the world's standard count of rigs, there are only 73 active rigs in Venezuela. 
 Rig procurement is going badly. Vierma testified that Pdvsa recently invited 63 companies to bid to supply rigs, but only 22 bid. Twelve received contracts, to supply 27 rigs, but only five companies actually took rigs to Venezuela. Vierma called this ''a silent sabotage by multinational companies.'' 
 Others might call it the market at work. Rigs are in high demand; rigs cost at least $15 million, and an offshore rig can cost more than $95 million. Why go to Venezuela? ''The big contractors want to take their rigs somewhere with less risk and threat of confiscation,'' one executive of a big drilling contractor in Venezuela told me. ''The way this government talks, it sends investors running.'' 
 I went to Lake Maracaibo to see the problem for myself. Maracaibo is South America's largest lake, a huge basin of duckweed and sewage, where significant oil drilling first began in the 1920s. I expected to see very few rigs. But what I found was more complicated.
 Driving down the lake's eastern shore one hot, rainy morning, I passed Pdvsa's Maracaibo complex. Huge oil storage tanks stood near the road. The entrance to the complex was marked by a sign with one of the revolution's slogans: ''Fatherland, Socialism or Death!'' The lake was strung with electrical lines and dotted in checkerboard fashion with wells, electrical towers and the graceful, 170-foot-high towers of drill rigs. In 1997, there were 57 rigs working on the lake. On the day I visited, there were 29. I saw more rigs, including seven in Pdvsa's yards, along the lake shore, docked along the bank. I asked one drilling contractor what they were doing there. ''Why aren't they out on the lake working if there's such a shortage?'' 
 ''Ahh,'' he said, and smiled. Like others I spoke with, he didn't want to be identified. ''I estimate that there are about 22 rigs sitting idle around the lake, but not all of them are operable, due to lack of maintenance, or because they require additional equipment,'' he told me. He said there were more idle rigs in Pdvsa docks across the lake.
 In June, Pdvsa took back operating and maintenance contracts for its working rigs from the contractors who held them. Ramirez, the oil minister, said that contractors were ''cannibals'' who were robbing the country, and that Pdvsa could do the work for a third of the price. But it's not clear that Pdvsa can do the work at all. 
 I counted at least 10 rigs belonging to Pdvsa that were not even being worked on -- the company's management is so poor, contractors said, that it cannot coordinate getting rigs repaired. Pdvsa is responsible for servicing all rigs working on the lake. ''You need a boat to come out to give you water, diesel, empty the cuttings, take away waste,'' one contractor said. ''But I've waited a week for them just to take trash off the rigs.'' There may be other reasons there are few working rigs. Vierma himself was briefly being investigated by the National Assembly -- notable, given that it contains no opposition members -- for overseeing the purchase of rigs from companies that supposedly had no rigs, no experience and little capital. 
 VI.
 Pdvsa's administrative troubles can be traced back to one of the biggest threats to Chavez's presidency. In December 2002, Pdvsa's managers, fed up with Chavez's attempts to control them, locked out the workers and shut down Venezuela's oil production for two months. The goal was either to take back control of Pdvsa or to topple Chavez. The economy collapsed, but ultimately Chavez triumphed over the ''oil sabotage,'' as his government called it, cementing his hold on power. 
 In the aftermath of the strike, Chavez fired 18,000 of Pdvsa's 46,000 workers -- the vast majority of them were managers and professionals, many of whom have since gone to work in Calgary, Houston or Riyadh. Pdvsa has since replaced the strikers, though the new hires are largely inexperienced. In fact, Pdvsa now employs 75,000 workers, many more than in the past, and Chavez says he wants to increase the number to 102,000 next year. Part of Chavez's new ''oil socialism'' is to make Pdvsa more self-sufficient, reducing dependence on outside service companies. So Pdvsa is creating new subsidiaries. One is a new oil-services unit -- ''our own Halliburton, ours, the 'Bolivarian' one,'' Ramirez, the energy minister, told state TV. Pdvsa has also announced plans to build oil ships and drill rigs. In June, Pdvsa approved the creation of seven new subsidiaries, including ones to grow soybeans for ethanol, to build food-processing plants and even to make shoes. Pdvsa is running a parallel state. 
 The company's workers must all have at least one qualification: they must be Chavistas. Ramirez told oil workers, in a speech that was taped clandestinely and passed to a TV station, that they should back the president or give their jobs to a Bolivarian. The company is ''red, red from top to bottom,'' he said. Pdvsa also wrote a letter to its contractors, warning them not to hire any of the 18,000 fired workers.
 As Pdvsa has been molded to Chavez's will, it has also become less and less transparent in its dealings. The company used to publish a standard annual report, but after 2004 it stopped filing its annual reports to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In recent years it has released only a page or two of basic figures, with no breakdowns or auditors' notes. When Pdvsa does release information, some of it is of questionable credibility. Even the most fundamental operational fact -- how much oil Venezuela produces -- is subject to debate. In 1997, Venezuela produced 3.3 million barrels per day of crude oil. Today, Pdvsa claims the country produces the same amount, but independent sources, including OPEC, say that figure is too high; OPEC puts Venezuela's production at 2.4 million barrels a day last year. 
 What is clear is that much of the oil revenue is going to social spending. Last year, Pdvsa says it spent nearly $14 billion on social programs. That includes the missions and Fonden, but does not include taxes and royalties of $21 billion paid to the government. Pdvsa says it put $5.8 billion back into the company last year. While this is a $2 billion hike from 2005, it most likely includes items that no one would call investment in oil; a secret addendum to the 2007 budget described ''investment'' as including money for national infrastructure and social projects. Pdvsa's own business plan calls for rapid growth in production, but oil analysts say the company is clearly not investing enough. According to Pavel Molchanov, who studies oil in Houston at Raymond James, a financial services company, Pdvsa has had two years of production decline and is likely to have at least two more. ''This is against a background of global oil production increasing 1 to 2 percent a year,'' he says. ''If they were spending enough would their production be down? I don't think so.'' (I would have liked to have asked Ramirez about this and many other matters. His office promised me an interview with him, but it never materialized, and Pdvsa officials said no one else could even give me background information unless Ramirez authorized it personally.)
 Pdvsa is also taking on debt. The company had very little debt until 2006, but this year it has borrowed $12.5 billion. While raising cash through debt offerings can be fiscally sound, and many companies do so, critics contend that Pdvsa is issuing bonds for the wrong reasons. ''Their debts are low, but they didn't have any before,'' says Jose Guerra, formerly chief of the research department of the Central Bank, who left in disagreement about Chavez's economic policies. ''Other oil countries are getting rid of debt. And what is the debt going for? Their spending on exploration is almost nothing. They are taking on debt to have a party.'' 
 Some of the private companies that the old Pdvsa had brought in are still working in Venezuela, but they are now only minority partners and are paying higher taxes and royalties. On May 1, foreign companies working in the Orinoco were told to cede majority control of their projects to Pdvsa. Two companies, ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips, left and are now negotiating with Venezuela about compensation. Other companies, seemingly chosen for their geopolitical value, have come into the Orinoco to take their place and develop virgin areas: national oil companies from big producers like Russia, China, Brazil and Iran, but also Cuba, Chile, Uruguay, Argentina and Belarus, which presumably can bring little expertise to the business of heavy oil. 
 VII.
 Pdvsa is now dedicated to creating a new oil product: it is turning petroleum directly into math problems. I watched this alchemy one night in the living room of Felix Caraballo. Caraballo, who is 32, lives in the El Encanto section of La Vega, a slum on the side of one of the steep mountains around Caracas. Caraballo has been working in La Vega on community projects since he was 14, when police officers killed a friend of his during the 1989 protests over the government's attempt to reduce gasoline subsidies. He is a committed Chavista and a committed socialist. ''Money should serve people and not the other way around,'' he told me. 
 The night I visited, the couches in his living room were pushed to one side to make a classroom. Yulimar Medina, a 25-year-old college student, stood at a whiteboard with a marker and walked the students through an equation. There were 11 adults, some with young children, in the room, studying the addition and multiplication of fractions. The students -- known in the program as vencedores, or triumphers -- all had workbooks, and they had already watched a 45-minute video of a math lesson. 
 This was an eighth-grade class of Mision Ribas, a program that brings grades 6 through 12 to barrios around the country. This class meets from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. every weeknight in Caraballo's house. The videos come from Cuba, and facilitators like Medina lead the class in discussion and exercises afterward. The vencedores study math, Spanish, history, geography, science and English, and must work together to do a community project, like building a staircase or planting a vegetable garden -- that's the part Caraballo guides. Not only is school free but most of the students also receive stipends of $85 a month to attend. The students themselves choose who gets the stipends, based on need and dedication. 
 Ribas is one of an ever-growing list of Chavez's missions. One teaches people to read. Another has imported thousands of Cuban doctors and dispatched them to poor neighborhoods around the country. Another set up stores in barrios that carry basic foodstuffs and medicines at highly subsidized prices. Another provides identity cards to undocumented citizens. While I was in Venezuela in September, Chavez announced another mission, to expand universities. The vast majority of the financing comes straight from Pdvsa. 
 The missions are popular and have benefited more than half of Venezuela's poorest sector. Venezuela's millions of poor take them as a sign of Chavez's commitment to them and to the government's slogan of ''zero misery.'' When I visited another Ribas class in an even more remote corner of La Vega, I asked the students what they valued most about the mission. ''It comes to our barrio,'' one student said. ''It doesn't exclude anyone,'' another said. 
 Spending oil money on schooling and doctors for the poor seems, intuitively, like the right thing to do. ''This is an investment in human capital,'' argues Mark Weisbrot, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, a left-leaning Washington policy group. ''You've had a focus on food and health care and education. It doesn't cost that much, and it's reaching a lot of people.'' 
 The Venezuelan who finishes high school with Mision Ribas may not have the same education she would get in a formal school. But without Ribas, she would have no high-school education at all. Chavez cares about reaching zero misery, something that can be said of few governments with oil. But no one really knows if the missions are actually moving Venezuela toward zero misery; the programs have no visible internal evaluation. Increasingly, the missions are replacing their formal counterparts. It is wonderful for poor neighborhoods to have health clinics staffed with Cuban doctors -- wonderful, unless you happen to need the services of one of Venezuela's hospitals, which are falling apart. 
 Political and ideological training, Ribas officials told me, is the top qualification for a facilitator. I attended a session for new Ribas students in Las Torres, a La Vega barrio near the top of the mountain. After Ribas officials told students how to register for classes and what would be expected of them, Maria Teresa Curvelo, the district coordinator, began a 90-minute talk about a referendum of great importance to the government. The referendum, to be held on Dec. 2, proposes changing the constitution to remove Chavez's term limits and increase his power among other things. She urged students to attend marches and street demonstrations supporting Chavez. ''Chavez is someone who comes along every 100 years,'' she told them. Afterward we rode down the mountain in a truck. When she got out, I thanked her. ''Fatherland, Socialism or Death!'' she replied. 
 VIII.
 Venezuela's poor have become much less so under Chavez. The population living in extreme poverty, measured by cash income, dropped from 20.3 percent in the last half of 1998 to 11.1 percent in the last half of 2006, according to official statistics. But an oil boom might be expected to alleviate poverty. The real question is whether the gains will be sustainable. Weisbrot says he thinks they will. He points to the missions and figures there are gains in health and education that cash income doesn't measure. But so far there is no sign of them: the percentage of those living without running water and living in inadequate housing, as well as the number of young children not attending school, has scarcely budged in the last 10 years. The percentage of babies born with low birth weights actually rose from 1999 to 2006. And this is according to government statistics. It is early, but these numbers may mean that the missions are mainly helping through the stipends. 
 Whatever success the missions have at helping the poor may be dwarfed by the grotesque distortions in the economy as a whole. Inflation is officially at 16 percent but is most likely higher, according to Orlando Ochoa, the economist, who is usually critical of Chavez. He says that in the basket of goods and services used to measure inflation, just under half the items are sold at government-controlled prices. Many goods simply can't be bought at those prices, and consumers must pay double the price in a street market. Or the goods can't be found at all, their producers forced out of business by price controls. Beans and sugar were hard to find cheaply when I visited Caracas in September; fresh milk and eggs hard to find at all. Recently, people had to line up for five hours to get a liter of milk. One proposal in Chavez's constitutional referendum could increase inflation much further by abolishing the autonomy of the Central Bank and giving the president power over Venezuela's international reserves. The proposal would also essentially allow Chavez to print money. 
 The major threat to the economy comes from the exchange rate. Oil caused the bolivar to be overvalued. Farms and factories are in trouble. They can't export and must compete at home with products imported at the official exchange rate, which is now about a third of the market rate. And so the country is awash in artificially cheap imported products, from basic foodstuffs, like Brazilian cooking oil, to fancy cars. ''Our productive capacity is too weak to create jobs,'' Petkoff says. ''But we consume like a rich country.'' 
 The disparity between the official exchange rate (2,150 bolivars to the dollar) and the black-market rate (6,200 bolivars at press time) has created a new class known as the Boliburgesia. Bankers, traders, anyone who works in finance or commerce, can get very rich manipulating the exchange rates. Buy all the imported whiskey and Hummers you want, is the message. Live a life of wild excess. Just don't try to produce anything.
 Even if the price of oil stays high, it may not be able to sustain Venezuela if oil production continues to drop, subsidized domestic consumption keeps rising and government spending continues unmeasured and unchecked. While other oil producers, like Russia and Nigeria, are piling up surpluses, Venezuela is spending everything it gets. Venezuela once had a $6 billion oil fund to be saved for lean years; Chavez has spent all but $700 million of it. The vast majority of Chavez's new missions and worker cooperatives are dependent on state handouts -- unsustainable when government revenue falls. A devaluation of the currency would wipe out the income gains of the poor. 
 This is classic oil curse, and Venezuela has seen it before. In 1973, and in 1981, Venezuela spent oil money wildly, without controls. Each time a boom ended, it left Venezuela worse off than before it began -- per capita income in 1999 was the same as in 1960. Chavez has quite likely intensified these cycles, and the country is less able to produce anything other than oil. 
 Venezuela's adventures in oil nationalization have produced two very different models. At a time when oil prices were low and the country in dire need of social spending, the old Pdvsa's focus on reinvesting in oil production was undemocratic and unfair to the Venezuelan people. But the new way has produced something arguably worse -- economic failure despite a boom in oil prices, and it is unfair to future generations. 
 IX.
 Nationalization is often a response to the failure of privatized oil to respond to the people's needs. Even in the United States, where there is a good chance of getting caught, oil companies have inflated their costs or illegally deducted costs and engaged in other machinations to minimize payouts. For poor countries, the risks of getting a raw deal from private oil companies are much greater. History is littered with contracts that give Big Oil obviously unfair advantages -- Shell in Nigeria, Mobil in Kazakhstan and Texaco in Ecuador to name a few. Oil can also be an irresistible seduction to a country's ruling class. Where democratic institutions -- or even merely transparent processes -- don't exist, the lure to corruption is powerful. Oil in Russia, for example, was sold off not for maximum profit to the country but maximum profit to the officials who oversaw privatization. In Equatorial Guinea, ExxonMobil, Amerada Hess, Marathon and others made payments to President Teodoro Obiang or his family for land, security and other services, according to a Senate investigation of money-laundering involving Riggs Bank, where some of those payments ended up. 
 Nationalization, however, doesn't cure these ills, and it can deprive a nation of its rightful take of its natural wealth in other ways. One is simply lack of know-how. One reason President Evo Morales of Bolivia pulled back from his threats to radically nationalize the country's gas industry is that Bolivian officials realize they cannot manage the business themselves. Morales has focused on raising royalties on fields with known reserves, fields where companies essentially are guaranteed a return on investment. The royalty had been at 18 percent. Under pressure from popular protests, the previous government raised the rate to 50 percent, and last year Morales raised it to 82 percent in some cases. While foreign investment in Bolivia's natural-gas industry has fallen, every analyst I talked to said it was not because of the royalty hike. Morales's nationalization rhetoric, not royalty rates, made private companies skittish. ''There's a big difference for an investor when there's a worry about nationalization,'' said Amy Myers Jaffe, a fellow at the nonpartisan James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy, at Rice University in Houston. ''There are intangible factors I can't control, and it's creating all this political risk.'' Roger Tissot of PFC Energy adds: ''Companies don't have a problem paying more rent and taxes. They do have a problem giving up control.'' 
 So perhaps the best strategy for resource-rich countries is to keep the oil private, watch it carefully and tax the hell out of it. Better yet, raise royalties, which are more straightforward and easier to collect. ''If your objective is to maximize rent, then the best way is to have companies compete with one another in open bidding for access,'' Tissot says. ''Angola and Libya have done this very successfully. Libya invited private companies to come back and is squeezing 90 percent of the profits out of them.'' 
 As a slogan, ''Negotiate a Better Royalty Rate!'' doesn't have the ring of ''The Oil Is Ours!''; nationalization of natural resources can bolster a country's psyche even if the management of those resources is a failure. The urge to nationalize is, at its core, a political one. Chavez seized Pdvsa not so it would produce more but so he could directly control the money. When governments give into this urge, they tend to be susceptible to the temptations of using oil for short-term gain. 
 But not always. Nationalized oil production doesn't necessarily lead to political corruption or shortsightedness. If the old Pdvsa were operating in today's booming oil market, there might be plenty of money for investment in oil and social programs. But it would be the government's job to watch the company closely to make sure the state got its fair share -- in other words, to ensure oil does what it should do: produce maximum sustainable money for the state. It's also the government's job to use the money wisely. That is a more important and difficult problem than the dilemma of whether to nationalize, and the solution does not depend on whether production is nationalized or privatized. It is not even an oil problem at all. 
 All oil production ends up at some point in the realm of politics -- whose interests will the bounty serve? The only way to mitigate the political influence is transparency for state-owned and private companies alike. ''There should be a law that a national oil company has to publish its corporate figures, matching an S.E.C. filing,'' says Jaffe, the Baker Institute fellow. ''We recommend that there be a regulator in Parliament that requires full reporting. And it should be open to the public. It's easy to say and hard to do.'' 
 Private companies do release credible annual reports -- but many of them never reveal what they pay host governments. Several new nongovernmental campaigns, like Publish What You Pay and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, are trying to shame companies and governments into bringing the books out into the open. So far they have had limited success. 
 ''The problem isn't who owns the resources, it's what you get from the proceeds,'' says David Mares, a professor of political science at the University of California, San Diego, who studies energy in Latin America. ''If you waste it in corruption and unsustainable programs, it's as bad as if you have international corporations dominating, who pay very few taxes.''
 Nationalization won't keep oil from being stolen. Good oversight, accountability and management of the funds will, no matter who owns the oil. ''On Jan. 1, 1976, the day of nationalization, Perez gave his speech with a banner behind him that read 'El Petroleo Es Nuestro,' '' Antonio Szabo says. ''Guess what? It was nuestro all along.''

HEADLINE: Weed It and Reap

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POLLAN. 
Michael Pollan, a contributing writer at The Times Magazine and a professor of journalism at the University of California at Berkeley, is the author of ''The Omnivore's Dilemma'' and the forthcoming ''In Defense of Food: An Eater's Manifesto.''

DATELINE: Berkeley, Calif. 

 BODY:
 FOR Americans who have been looking to Congress to reform the food system, these past few weeks have been, well, the best of times and the worst of times. A new politics has sprouted up around the farm bill, traditionally a parochial piece of legislation thrashed out in private between the various agricultural interests (wheat growers versus corn growers; meatpackers versus ranchers) without a whole lot of input or attention from mere eaters. 
 Not this year. The eaters have spoken, much to the consternation of farm-state legislators who have fought hard -- and at least so far with success -- to preserve the status quo. 
 Americans have begun to ask why the farm bill is subsidizing high-fructose corn syrup and hydrogenated oils at a time when rates of diabetes and obesity among children are soaring, or why the farm bill is underwriting factory farming (with subsidized grain) when feedlot wastes are polluting the countryside and, all too often, the meat supply. For the first time, the public health community has raised its voice in support of overturning farm policies that subsidize precisely the wrong kind of calories (added fat and added sugar), helping to make Twinkies cheaper than carrots and Coca-Cola competitive with water. Also for the first time, the international development community has weighed in on the debate, arguing that subsidized American exports are hobbling cotton farmers in Nigeria and corn farmers in Mexico.
 On Capitol Hill, hearings on the farm bill have been packed, and newspapers like The San Francisco Chronicle are covering the legislation as closely as The Des Moines Register, bringing an unprecedented level of attention to what has long been one of the most obscure and least sexy pieces of legislation in Congress. Sensing the winds of reform at his back, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, told a reporter in July: ''This is not just a farm bill. It's a food bill, and Americans who eat want a stake in it.''
 Right now, that stake is looking more like a toothpick. Americans who eat have little to celebrate in the bill that Mr. Harkin is expected to bring to the floor this week. Like the House bill passed in July, the Senate product is very much a farm bill in the tradition- al let-them-eat-high-fructose-corn-syrup mold. 
 For starters, the Old Guard on both agriculture committees has managed to preserve the entire hoary contraption of direct payments, countercyclical payments and loan deficiency payments that subsidize the five big commodity crops -- corn, wheat, rice, soybeans and cotton -- to the tune of $42 billion over five years. 
 The Old Guard has also managed to add a $5 billion ''permanent disaster'' program (excuse me, but isn't a permanent disaster a contradiction in terms?) to help farmers in the High Plains struggling to grow crops in a drought-prone region that, as the chronic need for disaster aid suggests, might not be the best place to grow crops. 
 When you consider that farm income is at record levels (thanks to the ethanol boom, itself fueled by another set of federal subsidies); that the World Trade Organization has ruled that several of these subsidies are illegal; that the federal government is broke and the president is threatening a veto, bringing forth a $288 billion farm bill that guarantees billions in payments to commodity farmers seems impressively defiant.
 How could this have happened? For starters, farm bill critics did a far better job demonizing subsidies, and depicting commodity farmers as welfare queens, than they did proposing alternative -- and politically appealing -- forms of farm support. And then the farm lobby did what it has always done: bought off its critics with ''programs.'' For that reason ''Americans who eat'' can expect some nutritious crumbs from the farm bill, just enough to ensure that reform-minded legislators will hold their noses and support it. 
 It's an old story: the ''hunger lobby'' gets its food stamps so long as the farm lobby can have its subsidies. Similar, if less lavish, terms are now being offered to the public health and environmental ''interests'' to get them on board. That's why there's more money in this farm bill for nutrition programs and, for the first time, about $2 billion to support ''specialty crops'' -- farm-bill-speak for the kind of food people actually eat. (Since California grows most of the nation's specialty crops, this was the price for the state delegation's support. Cheap indeed!) 
 There's also money for the environment: an additional $4 billion in the Senate bill to protect wetlands and grasslands and reward farmers for environmental stewardship, and billions in the House bill for environmental cleanup. There's an important provision in both bills that will make it easier for schools to buy food from local farmers. And there's money to promote farmers' markets and otherwise support the local food movement. 
 But as important as these programs are, they are just programs -- mere fleas on the elephant in the room. The name of that elephant is the commodity title, the all-important subsidy section of the bill. It dictates the rules of the entire food system. As long as the commodity title remains untouched, the way we eat will remain unchanged. 
 The explanation for this is straightforward. We would not need all these nutrition programs if the commodity title didn't do such a good job making junk food and fast food so ubiquitous and cheap. Food stamps are crucial, surely, but they will be spent on processed rather than real food as long as the commodity title makes calories of fat and sugar the best deal in the supermarket. We would not need all these conservation programs if the commodity title, by paying farmers by the bushel, didn't encourage them to maximize production with agrochemicals and plant their farms with just one crop fence row to fence row. 
 And the government would not need to pay feedlots to clean up the water or upgrade their manure pits if subsidized grain didn't make rearing animals on feedlots more economical than keeping them on farms. Why does the farm bill pay feedlots to install waste treatment systems rather than simply pay ranchers to keep their animals on grass, where the soil would be only too happy to treat their waste at no cost? 
 However many worthwhile programs get tacked onto the farm bill to buy off its critics, they won't bring meaningful reform to the American food system until the subsidies are addressed -- until the underlying rules of the food game are rewritten. This is a conversation that the Old Guard on the agriculture committees simply does not want to have, at least not with us. 
 But its defiance on the subsidy question may actually be a sign of weakness, for one detects a note of defensiveness creeping into the rhetoric. ''I know people on the outside can sit and complain about this,'' Representative Collin Peterson of Minnesota, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, told The San Francisco Chronicle last summer. ''But frankly most of those people have no clue what they're talking about. Most people in the city have no concept of what's going on here.'' 
 It seems more likely that, this time around, people in the city and all across the country know exactly what's going on -- they just don't like it. 
 Mr. Peterson's farm bill passed the House by the smallest margin in years, and might have been picked apart on the floor if Representative Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, hadn't leapt to its defense. 
 (She claimed to be helping freshmen Democrats from rural districts.) 
 But Senate rules are different, and Mr. Harkin's bill will be challenged on the floor and very possibly improved. One sensible amendment that Senator Byron Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota, and Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa, are expected to introduce would put a $250,000 cap on the payments any one farmer can receive in a year. This would free roughly $1 billion for other purposes (like food stamps and conservation) and slow the consolidation of farms in the Midwest. 
 A more radical alternative proposed by Senator Richard Lugar, Republican of Indiana, and Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, would scrap the current subsidy system and replace it with a form of free government revenue insurance for all American farmers and ranchers, including the ones who grow actual food. Commodity farmers would receive a payment only when their income dropped more than 15 percent as the result of bad weather or price collapse. The $20 billion saved under this plan, called the Fresh Act, would go to conservation and nutrition programs, as well as to deficit reduction. 
 What finally emerges from Congress depends on exactly who is paying closest attention next week on the Senate floor and then later in the conference committee. We know the American Farm Bureau will be on the case, defending the commodity title on behalf of those who benefit from it most: the biggest commodity farmers, the corporations who sell them chemicals and equipment and, most of all, the buyers of cheap agricultural commodities -- companies like Archer Daniels Midland, Cargill, Coca-Cola and McDonald's. 
 In the past that alliance could have passed a farm bill like this one without breaking a sweat. But the politics of food have changed, and probably for good. If the eaters and all the other ''people on the outside'' make themselves heard, we just might end up with something that looks less like a farm bill and more like the food bill a poorly fed America so badly needs.

HEADLINE: A Year Still to Go, and Presidential Politics Have Shifted Already

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
With a year to go until Election Day, the Republican and Democratic Parties are going through internal battles over their very identity, even as the races for their presidential nominations intensify. In many ways, the battles over how the parties will define themselves in the post-Bush era are nearly as significant a political fight as the presidential contest itself. 
 The continued strength of Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York mayor who supports abortion rights and gay rights, is testing the question of whether social issues still drive Republican primary voters. Mr. Giuliani is talking about terrorism, cutting taxes, his record in managing New York City government -- but he has made no serious effort to shade his positions to appeal to the social conservatives who helped reshape the party over the past three decades and helped President Bush win the White House twice. 
 Should Mr. Giuliani win the nomination, he would give the party a very different definition and face than the Southerners and evangelicals who have been ascendant until now. 
 The challenge to orthodoxy is slightly less marked on the Democratic side, where the party has tilted from the left to the center over the past 20 years. Tough talk about Iran by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York has put her at odds with much of her party, and her nomination would suggest the party is willing to embrace a relatively hawkish foreign policy even as it promises to end the war in Iraq. 
 It typically falls to the nominee to provide the ideological framework for his or her party. That appears to be especially so this time, reflecting how both parties are somewhat adrift after eight years under Mr. Bush. 
 ''The Republican Party is waiting for a nominee to voice a post-Bush vision for the party,'' said Richard N. Bond, a former Republican National Committee chairman.
 Of the two, the Republican Party seems to be at more of a turning point. Even if Mr. Giuliani fails to win the nomination, the fact that so many Republicans were willing to consider a candidate who was openly for abortion rights and gay rights -- something that would have been unthinkable four years ago -- suggests just how much the definition of what it means to be a Republican is changing.
 On the Democratic side, the thirst to retake the White House is easing some of the party's traditional internal divisions. ''Ideological battles tend not to happen when parties believe they are going to win,'' said Joe Andrews, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
 Still, if Mrs. Clinton should win the nomination, her campaign so far suggests that she would follow in her husband's footsteps by trying to bridge the divide between the party's liberals and centrists. A victory by former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, whose campaign is being run and highly influenced by many of the same advisers who managed Howard Dean's presidential campaign in 2004, would suggest the party is leaning more to the left.
 For Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, it may be more a matter of tone than ideology. Mr. Obama has said he wanted to transcend partisanship even as he appeals for support from a party whose base has been hungry for partisan battle. Mr. Bond and others have suggested that a victory by Mr. Obama could produce the most striking change in the identity of the Democratic Party.
 ''Obama is in a position to reposition his party not only in terms of issues, but in terms of offering a more general embracing appeal,'' Mr. Bond said.
 The Bush Effect: The President as Asset, but Only to Democrats
 Consider this tally: 47 to 2. 
 That's the number of times Democrats invoked President Bush's name during their most recent debate to the number of times Republicans mentioned him at theirs (and one of the two Republican mentions was criticism from Representative Ron Paul of Texas, an antiwar candidate). Such are the consequences of being one of the least popular presidents since the invention of modern polling.
 Aside from Mr. Paul, the Republicans almost never directly criticize the president. They hardly talk about him at all. And when they do, it never seems to have much of a four-more-years ring to it. ''Change Begins With Us,'' is one of Mitt Romney's slogans.
 The Republicans are in a bind. The president's approval rating was at 30 percent in a CBS News poll in mid-October, so to embrace him is to risk alienating voters in the general election. But the same poll found that more than two-thirds of Republican voters still approved of Mr. Bush's job performance, so if the candidates are too critical of him they risk offending primary voters.
 The candidates walk a tightrope, refraining from criticizing Mr. Bush while sometimes telegraphing their independence from him. Rudolph W. Giuliani praises Mr. Bush as keeping the nation safe even as he presents himself as a competent manager, perhaps to draw a contrast with the president. Senator John McCain says little about Mr. Bush, but is outspoken in his criticism of some members of the administration. Fred D. Thompson presents a basically optimistic view of the nation, but criticizes some Bush programs, like the No Child Left Behind law. 
 Mr. Bush faces a challenge of his own: How to stay relevant as coverage of the race to succeed him eclipses coverage of his presidency. While it is unclear how potent a fund-raiser he will prove, whether Republicans will ask him to campaign for them, or what role he will play at the convention, Mr. Bush may have shown a glimpse of his strategy in recent days as he stepped up his criticism of the Democratic Congress. MICHAEL COOPER 
 The Money Race: Democrats Find Favor With G.O.P. Mainstays
 As if Republicans need more evidence that they are in for a tough 2008, even traditionally Republican industries are shifting more of their giving to Democrats this year, and especially to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, who leads the Democrats in polls. 
 According to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which categorized contributions by industry, individuals working in the finance, insurance and real estate businesses have given $32.5 million, or 54 percent, of their contributions this year to Democratic presidential candidates. Mrs. Clinton alone received $12.1 million of that money. 
 A total of $28.2 million went to Republicans. Rudolph W. Giuliani, who leads the Republicans in national polls, received about $10.5 million. 
 The trends are even clearer when compared with 2004 (when there was only one Republican, President Bush, seeking contributions). 
 People working for energy and natural resources companies gave 80 percent of their presidential contributions to Mr. Bush in 2004. This year, 59 percent of their money has gone to Republicans. Mr. Giuliani has been the biggest recipient, with $818,000. Mrs. Clinton is second with $569,000. 
 The health care industry, which had a rocky history with the last Democratic administration, President Bill Clinton's, has given $6.3 million to Democrats, including $2.6 million to Mrs. Clinton, more than any other candidate. It has given $4.8 million to Republicans.
 The construction industry still favors Republicans but less than before. It put about 70 percent of its presidential money into Mr. Bush's campaign in 2004 but has given just 59 percent of it to Republicans this year; Mr. Giuliani received $1.4 million, and Mrs. Clinton received $1.3 million.
 Likewise, agribusiness, which gave to Republicans by a 3-to-1 ratio in 2004, has only slightly favored Republicans this year, with $3.2 million for presidential candidates. Mitt Romney received the most, $565,000, but Mrs. Clinton was close behind, with $524,000. DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK
 Foreign Conundrums: A War-Weary Divide on the Question of Iran
 With Iraq torn by sectarian division, Afghanistan struggling and Pakistan teetering toward chaos, it is the prospect of a new war -- to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons -- that is dominating the foreign policy skirmishes of the presidential campaign. 
 Republicans frequently raise the specter of Iran on the campaign trail, and are quick to point to the Democrats' stance in favor of diplomacy as a sign of weakness. Because the Iran question is still largely theoretical, it is also easier to talk about than the realities of Iraq.
 Unlike in 2004, however, when President Bush won re-election largely because of his popularity on national security issues, most Americans now favor an end to the war in Iraq and are leery of a military confrontation in Iran, according to the most recent New York Times/CBS News Poll. Democrats are hoping that a war-weary nation will appreciate a tone of caution.
 Still, the fear of being labeled weak remains, and so the Iran issue has opened a rift between Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and her rivals, particularly Senator Barack Obama and John Edwards. Mrs. Clinton has been castigated for supporting a Congressional resolution declaring the Revolutionary Guard of Iran a terrorist organization. 
 Mrs. Clinton, they argue, is making the same mistake she made in 2002, giving the administration political cover should it take military action. Mrs. Clinton has countered that her vote meant nothing of the kind.
 All of the Democrats, nonetheless, argue against a ''rush to war,'' banking that voters will be reluctant to open a new military front in the Middle East. MARC SANTORA
 Court Jesters: The Rise of Comedians, The New News Anchors 
 It is no secret that late-night comedians have become quasi news anchors, especially to under-30 voters -- about half of whom say they at least sometimes learn about the campaign from programs like ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''The Daily Show'' (compared with about a quarter of people ages 30 to 49), a 2004 Pew Research Center survey found.
 Late-night laugh-meisters insist they are ''equal-opportunity offenders'' (in Jay Leno's words).
 Conservatives say otherwise, complaining that late-night political humor slants left and skewers right. Jon Stewart, host of ''The Daily Show,'' is an avowed lefty, and Stephen Colbert's on-air persona is a conservative buffoon. 
 The Bush administration has been wildly popular with comics, if not voters -- the president and his aides were the subject of 1,245 late-night jokes from Jan. 1 to Oct. 10, according to a survey conducted by the Center for Media and Public Affairs. That compares with 749 jokes about Democrats.
 On the other hand, the Democratic candidates for president have been the butt of 383 jokes so far this year, compared with 312 aimed at the Republican candidates.
 Bias or not, presidential campaigns are gold mines of humor, intended and otherwise (think ''Dukakis tank'' in the otherwise category). Senator John McCain might have scored the howler of the cycle so far when, during a Republican debate last month, he criticized Mrs. Clinton's effort to allocate $1 million for a Woodstock museum. ''I wasn't there,'' Mr. McCain said of Woodstock, the 1969 rock 'n' roll festival. ''I'm sure it was a cultural and pharmaceutical event. I was tied up at the time.'' 
 Mr. McCain, a former prisoner of war, received a standing ovation.
 Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. rocked a South Carolina debate hall with his answer to a question about his whether he was capable of containing his long-windedness. ''Yes,'' was his one-word reply.
 One harbinger of less funny days ahead: the candidates who have rated highest on the laugh meter -- like Mr. Biden and Mike Huckabee -- tend to rate lower in the polls. And no one will mistake Hillary Rodham Clinton or Rudolph W. Giuliani for Don Rickles. MARK LEIBOVICH
 The Battle for Congress: Democrats' Advantage May Only Grow Wider 
 Even with Democrats struggling to run Congress -- and drawing near-record-low poll figures for their efforts -- they could hold or add to their majorities in both the House and Senate next year. 
 The Democrats control the Senate 51 to 49, including two independents who generally vote with the party, and are favored to pick up seats being vacated by Republicans in Virginia and Colorado, and possibly New Mexico. In New Hampshire, Maine, Minnesota and Oregon, Republican incumbents face serious challenges. Louisiana may represent the Republicans' best hope to pick up a seat.
 In the House, where all 435 seats are up for re-election, Democrats also have an edge. First, as of Sept. 30, they had $28 million in the bank compared with $1.6 million for Republicans. 
 Second, they could benefit from a growing roster of Republican House seats being vacated because of retirements -- 14 so far. Those include the 15th District of Ohio, where Republican Deborah Pryce is stepping down after narrowly winning in 2006, and the 11th District in Illinois, a traditionally Republican seat held by Representative Jerry Weller. 
 But Republican strategists are focusing on the dozens of House seats Democrats picked up in 2006, which they say can be reclaimed by Republicans. And they are confident they can raise enough money. 
 ''We don't have to go back and win a lot of new territory to be successful,'' said Representative Tom Cole of Oklahoma, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. ''We simply have to recapture what we had.''
 The Republican reclamation projects include the Second District of Kansas, where Representative Nancy Boyda won in a Democratic upset, and the 18th District of Ohio, now held by Representative Zack Space after a scandal sent the former Republican lawmaker Bob Ney to prison.
 Other House seats will move into play as the parties settle on their candidates and frame their overarching strategies against the backdrop of the presidential campaign. CARL HULSE
 Economic Disparity: Talk of Raising Taxes (But Only on Rich People)
 Republican candidates are all staying to their traditional playbooks on taxes, promising to make President Bush's cuts permanent -- with some proposing additional cuts -- and eagerly trying to tarnish Democrats as ''tax and spend liberals.''
 The big difference in this campaign is on the Democratic side. For the first presidential election since Walter Mondale ran against Ronald Reagan in 1984, Democrats think it is possible to talk about tax increases -- but only for ''the rich'' -- without getting crushed.
 The leading Democratic contenders have all suggested they would roll back Mr. Bush's cuts for households with incomes above about $200,000 a year -- roughly, the top 2 percent of earners. Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama would let these cuts to expire at the end of 2010. John Edwards would try to abolish the cuts immediately.
 Democrats are betting on popular perceptions of growing economic inequality, combined with eight years of Republican tax cuts that have often benefited the wealthy. 
 The strategy could be risky. The tax-raising proposals could raise hackles among affluent two-income families, who may not think $200,000 a year qualifies as them as rich. And the increases could become far more unpopular if, as most economists predict, economic growth slows because of the housing downturn and soaring oil prices.
 But the biggest trade-off would be taxes for health care. Most of the Democratic plans for universal health care coverage would cost around $100 billion, and most of the candidates say they would pay for that by reversing Mr. Bush's tax cuts on the top 2 percent.
 As politically appealing as this sounds, Democrats are already finding it at odds with another goal: abolishing the alternative minimum tax, which was originally created to snag millionaires but threatens now to engulf tens of millions of households. Repealing that tax would cost about $1 trillion over 10 years.
 When Democratic Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York recently proposed eliminating the alternative minimum tax by imposing a 4 percent surtax on households with incomes above $200,000, most House Democrats ran for cover. The Democratic presidential contenders have been virtually mum on it. EDMUND L. ANDREWS
 Nerves: Pinning Hopes, and Fears, On a Clinton Candidacy
 Ever since the Democratic Congressional victories of 2006, confidence has been rising among party leaders and major donors that they can retake the White House in 2008. Yet as the primaries approach, an abiding worry looms: Could Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton lose a sure-thing general election?
 Democrats have myriad concerns about a Clinton candidacy -- she will ultimately prove too polarizing for swing voters, say, or her hawkish views (from early support for the Iraq war to her current tough line on Iran) will be out of sync with the electorate. Karl Rove and company played on these psychic fears by arguing that Mrs. Clinton would be (a) the Democrats' likely nominee and (b) a fatally flawed candidate. And her Democratic rivals are pouncing on the theme, saying Republicans see her as the most beatable nominee.
 Nothing aggravates Clinton advisers more than the idea that Mrs. Clinton will be the skunk at the Democratic garden party next November. They point to public opinion polls that show Mrs. Clinton beating possible Republican rivals in a general election matchup, her popularity with Democrats and the support she received from New York Republicans in her 2006 Senate race.
 Supporters of Mrs. Clinton also warn that questions about her electability from her Democratic rivals could backfire on all of them, especially if she becomes the nominee. That is why Mrs. Clinton says, over and over, that Democratic candidates should keep the criticism on President Bush, a target that she believes will fire up voters and strengthen the electability of any Democrat who seeks to replace him.
 Mrs. Clinton is determined to stay above the fray -- that was her husband's advice to her before the last, heated televised debate, her advisers say. Her team, meanwhile, wants to erase the ''skunk'' image by primary time, knowing that her rivals can make Democrats shudder by warning she could lose the White House for them all. PATRICK HEALY
 The Internet: Can Voters Hear a Rally If It's Held in Cyberspace?
 When Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton posted a rapid-response video to criticism of her debate performance last week, her campaign once again displayed its deft use of the Internet. 
 Candidates are courting voters and donors by using online video and social-networking sites like Facebook, and Internet contributions have soared with page views. Democrats have maintained an advantage with this crowd, but Republicans have found creative ways to draw Internet supporters, too. 
 All of which makes this election cycle a singular test for whether these tools will translate into significant votes, and which will be most successful. While the YouTube debates underscore the popularity of user-generated video, candidate Web videos have become part of the ''daily cut and thrust of campaigns like never before,'' said Michael Cornfield, adjunct professor at George Washington University and author of ''Politics Moves Online: Campaigning and the Internet.'' ''That's now the new standard.'' 
 Still, no candidate has taken as naturally to video the way television fell for Ronald Reagan and John F. Kennedy, he said. The primaries will be instructive in the use of social-networking sites like Facebook, where friends of Senator Barack Obama and Representative Ron Paul dominate cyberspace. 
 ''Facebook's an open question mark,'' Professor Cornfield said, ''and we're going to get answers in January.'' Professor Cornfield pointed to Mitt Romney's campaign as a Web-savvy effort, then offered up Rudolph W. Giuliani as a caveat to the victory-via-the-Internet thesis: ''The reality check is always Rudy, who has the worst Web operation of anyone, but it doesn't seem to hurt him much. You don't have to do this like a virtuoso to win.'' KATE PHILLIPS
 Wild Cards: When the Unexpected Changes All Expectations
 Game-changers: those campaign-shaking events that can alter the dynamic of a race. 
 Advisers to Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, say he might now be President Dean had it not been for the 2003 capture of Saddam Hussein, which they say curtailed his effectiveness at building a case against President Bush's policy in Iraq (others say it was the scream, Mr. Dean's blundered attempt to rally his troops after he came in third in the Iowa caucuses, a game-changer of another kind). 
 The Osama bin Laden video that came out days before the 2004 vote? Advisers to Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and President Bush agree that it helped put the incumbent over the top, feeding into his message that it is a dangerous world. 
 But by 2006, the terrorism fears that had driven the 2004 election were replaced by concerns raised by Hurricane Katrina and the Bush administration's handling of its aftermath. The competency issue helped Democrats win Congressional majorities and stop a small but growing migration of black voters to the Republican side. 
 Every major campaign tries to protect itself against self-inflicted wounds, hiring teams to comb through their candidate's background to make sure the boss isn't hiding a surprise. But they have a harder time preparing for real-world events that can rock campaigns. John Weaver, the former chief strategist for Senator John McCain, said he and his team ran through several potential developments, especially, ''What we would do in case there's another terrorist attack -- that was the main one.'' 
 Mr. Weaver said the effort was meant to get the strategists thinking about what to do immediately after an attack, such as whether it would be best to shut the campaign down briefly.
 But Jim Jordan, a campaign adviser to Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and a Kerry campaign manager in 2004, said the politics of terrorism were unpredictable. ''Most would find it grotesquely unseemly to plan out what you would do and say about a loss of life on a significant scale,'' Mr. Jordan said. 
 Grotesquely unseemly? In politics? JIM RUTENBERG

HEADLINE: Iraq, With U.S. Support, Voids a Russian Oil Contract

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER; James Glanz contributed reporting.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Oct. 29 

 BODY:
Guided by American legal advisers, the Iraqi government has canceled a controversial development contract with the Russian company Lukoil for a vast oil field in Iraq's southern desert, freeing it up for potential international investment in the future.
 In response, Russian authorities have threatened to revoke a 2004 deal under the Paris Club of creditor nations to forgive $13 billion in Iraqi debt, a senior Iraqi official said. 
 The field, West Qurna, has estimated reserves of 11 billion barrels, the equivalent of the worldwide proven oil reserves of Exxon Mobil, America's largest oil company. Hussain al-Shahristani, the Iraqi oil minister, said in an interview that the field would be opened to new bidders, perhaps as early as next year.
 The contract, which had been signed and later canceled by the Saddam Hussein government, had been in legal limbo since the American invasion. But the Kremlin remained hopeful it could be salvaged until this September, when Mr. Shahristani traveled to Moscow to inform officials there that the decision to cancel it was final, he said. 
 The Russian government, newly emboldened in international affairs by its expanding oil wealth, is still backing Lukoil's claim and protesting what it considers selective enforcement of contracts in Iraq.
 ''We will defend our interests,'' Dmitri S. Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman, said in a telephone interview. ''It is the government's obligation to defend the interests of our companies in foreign countries.'' 
 One Iraqi official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was discussing a confidential diplomatic exchange, described Russia's response as, ''If you do the deal, we can muster the political muscle to forgive the debt.''
 West Qurna, mapped by Soviet geologists in the 1980s but mostly untapped, is one of a dozen or so supergiant oil fields in the world. They are known in the industry as ''elephants,'' fields so large they can tip the fortunes of companies or countries.
 The field will produce one million barrels of oil a day after four to five years of development, according to both Iraqi oil officials and Lukoil; that is the approximate equivalent of the current output of the North Slope in Alaska.
 In Lukoil's 1997 production-sharing agreement, Saddam Hussein's government awarded the company development rights to the 11 billion barrels of oil for a paltry signing bonus of $10 million. The deal, concluded when Iraq was seeking Russian support in a failed effort to lift United Nations sanctions, allotted 9.6 percent of the output to Lukoil.
 The contract presented a quandary for the United States, which has been accused by some critics of invading Iraq for its oil. There is little evidence to date that the war effort has given American oil companies an inside track to Iraq's reserves, and the Lukoil deal is the only one involving a major oil company to be reversed since the start of the war. 
 But as a cornerstone of its foreign policy, the United States has argued vigorously for countries to honor petroleum contracts. In that light, condoning the cancellation of the Lukoil contract could be seen in some quarters as evidence of a double standard. 
 ''From the Russian government perspective, Iraq is seen as occupied and its administration directed by Washington, particularly when it comes to oil,'' Vladimir I. Tikhomirov, chief economist at the Russian bank UralSib, said in a telephone interview. 
 ''The Russians see the cancellation of their contract in Iraq as part of the U.S. drive to keep control over the major oil fields there,'' he said. 
 The Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, has raised the issue with President Bush several times since the 2003 invasion. In an interview with the BBC in June 2003, Mr. Putin said Mr. Bush had gone as far as offering assurances.
 ''At our last meeting,'' Mr. Putin said, ''Bush directly and clearly said, 'We do not have any goals of pressuring Russian companies out of Iraq and we are ready to create the conditions for working together there.' I have no reason not to believe him.''
 The legality of the Lukoil contract remains murky. It is Iraq's stated policy, as laid out in a draft oil law now before Parliament, to honor contracts signed by the Saddam Hussein government. It is doing just that with contracts with Chinese, Vietnamese, Indonesian and Indian oil companies.
 But the Iraqis note that it was the Saddam Hussein government that canceled the Lukoil contract. The government's spokesman, Tariq Aziz, said at the time that the government believed the Russians were negotiating with the Americans to secure the contract in event of an invasion.
 Early in the American occupation, the question arose whether the Hussein government's decision was valid, said Michael Stinson, the former chief adviser to the Iraqi Oil Ministry. The answer was supplied by the principal American legal adviser to the ministry at the time, Robert Maguire, who Mr. Stinson said was then working for the Defense Department. Mr. Maguire drew on pre-Hussein-era law to justify the cancellation, Mr. Stinson said.

HEADLINE: Union Reaches Tentative 4-Year Agreement With Ford

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD and NICK BUNKLEY; Nick Bunkley reported from Dearborn and Wayne, Mich.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
The United Automobile Workers union reached a tentative four-year agreement with the Ford Motor Company early Saturday that follows the pattern set in new contracts at General Motors and Chrysler.
 Unlike those contracts, the agreement at Ford was reached without a strike, and the union did not even set a deadline for reaching a new deal. Analysts say Ford, which lost $12.6 billion last year and whose car and truck sales have plummeted, was the least able to withstand a strike.
 ''I'm elated that we didn't have to strike. We were ready to go, but it's a good feeling that we didn't have to,'' said Keith W. Brown, president of U.A.W. Local 245 in Dearborn, Mich., which represents hourly workers at Ford's research and engineering facilities. 
 Union leaders will now have to sell the contract to Ford workers, who are wary about their future given the likelihood that the company will soon order another round of job and spending cuts as it tries to revamp its operations in North America.
 Any reductions will almost certainly wait until after workers vote on the tentative agreement, a process expected to take place over the next few weeks. Both G.M. and Chrysler announced job cuts after their contracts were approved, which Mr. Brown said could make Ford workers more hesitant to support their agreement. 
 ''I think they did business in bad faith,'' Mr. Brown said of Chrysler, which said on Thursday that it would eliminate another 11,000 hourly and salaried jobs in the United States and Canada, on top of 13,000 cuts announced in February.
 However, the peaceful settlement may cause some union members to be suspicious of the deal, said Gary Chaison, professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
 ''Workers may doubt that the union has done all they can without a strike, since that seems to be their modus operandi for these negotiations,'' he said.
 Like the G.M. and Chrysler agreements, the Ford deal calls for setting up a health care trust, to be run by an outside board including union representatives. It would free the company of about $23 billion in long-term liabilities, while Ford would make an unspecified contribution to create the trust.
 No other details of the deal were released, but it is expected to be similar to the deals at G.M. and Chrysler, which include a new two-tier wage system for newly hired and less-essential workers, as well as buyout offers meant to encourage some Ford workers to retire or give up their jobs.
 ''Our bargaining committee came through for our active and retired members,'' the union's president, Ron Gettelfinger, said in a statement. He said that its bargaining team had ''encouraged Ford to invest in product and people while addressing the economic needs of our active and retired members.''
 Bob King, a union vice president who runs its Ford department, said, ''We face enormous challenges, and we also have enormous potential. Our goals for this contract were to win new product and investment, to enhance job security and protect seniority -- and we made progress in all these areas.''
 Union leaders will review the contract next week, before it is presented to members for a vote.
 The agreement was ''fair to our employees and retirees, and paves the way for Ford to increase its competitiveness in the United States,'' Joe W. Laymon, Ford's group vice president for human resources and labor, said in a statement.
 Bargainers began the final round of talks at 10 a.m. Eastern time on Thursday. The deal was reached at 3:20 a.m. on Saturday. Ford shares rose more than 5 percent on Friday, to end at $8.95, on expectations that a deal was close.
 Ford's previous contract expired Sept. 14, but the company and the union had agreed to an indefinite extension. The union went on strike against G.M. for two days in late September and against Chrysler for about six hours in early October before reaching agreements.
 Workers at G.M. approved their new contract by a 2-to-1 margin, but the vote at Chrysler was ratified by only a slim majority, with workers at six large assembly plants rejecting it.
 Ford's sales have fallen 13 percent this year, the most of any Detroit auto company, in part because it is foregoing unprofitable sales to rental car agencies. But consumer demand has also dropped. Ford slipped behind Toyota this year to rank as the third-biggest automaker, with G.M. in the No. 1 spot.
 The company is in the middle of a revamping plan, known as the Way Forward, that calls for cutting 44,000 salaried and hourly jobs. Ford has said it plans to close 16 plants, 6 of which have not been identified. 
 The Detroit Free Press reported on its Web site on Saturday that Ford had decided to put off naming those factories. But given its slumping sales, Ford may need to cut costs faster. Ford has mortgaged most of its United States assets to raise cash, and executives say they do not expect the company to be profitable in North America until 2009.
 Wall Street analysts are forecasting a loss of nearly $1 billion in the third quarter when Ford reports results on Thursday.

HEADLINE: Is (His) Biography (Our) Destiny?

BYLINE: By JAMES TRAUB. 
James Traub, a contributing writer, is working on a book about democracy promotion. His last feature for the magazine was a profile of Al Gore.

 BODY:
''If I am the face of American foreign policy and American power,'' Barack Obama mused not long ago aboard his campaign plane, ''as long as we are also making prudent strategic decisions, handling emergencies, crises and opportunities in the world in an intelligent and sober way. . . .'' He stopped. He wanted to make sure he got this just right, and he had got a little caught up in rebutting the claim, which Hillary Clinton has artfully advanced, that he is not prepared to handle emergencies. Obama stopped picking at his grilled salmon in order to stare out at the sky for a few moments. ''I think,'' he said, in that deep and measured voice of his, ''that if you can tell people, 'We have a president in the White House who still has a grandmother living in a hut on the shores of Lake Victoria and has a sister who's half-Indonesian, married to a Chinese-Canadian,' then they're going to think that he may have a better sense of what's going on in our lives and in our country. And they'd be right.'' 
 Perhaps they would. Obama's supporters believe that his life story and the angle of vision it affords him hold out the possibility of curing the harm they would say we have done to ourselves through our indifference to the views of others and through the insularity of a president who seems so incurious about the world. There is thus an emblematic force to Obama's candidacy. A President Obama, says Joseph Nye, the Harvard professor who popularized the term ''soft power'' to describe the capacity to gain support through attraction rather than force, ''would do more for America's soft power around the world than anything else we could do.'' 
 But Nye wasn't quite finished. At a meeting of national-security experts in August, he played out a harrowing crisis situation involving Iran and concluded afterward that ''much though I'm attracted to the freshness of Obama's life story, I would come out on the experience side of it'' -- that is, on Clinton's side. This is Obama's problem in a nutshell. Democratic voters seem to be torn between the hope of reshaping a frightening world and the fear of being terribly vulnerable to that world. Perhaps Obama's inability so far to make a dent in Clinton's 20-point (or more) lead in the polls proves that many believe he's on the wrong side of that balance.
 The United States has had only one foreign policy and one national-security strategy since the transforming events of 9/11 -- and this set of doctrines has been shaped by the very distinctive worldview of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney and the men and women around them. The great project of the foreign-policy world in the last few years has been to think through a ''post-post-9/11 strategy,'' in the words of the Princeton Project on National Security, a study that brought together many of the foreign-policy thinkers of both parties. Such a strategy, the experts concluded, must, like ''a Swiss Army knife,'' offer different tools for different situations, rather than only the sharp edge of a blade; must pay close attention to ''how others may perceive us differently than we perceive ourselves, no matter how good our intentions''; must recognize that other nations may legitimately care more about their neighbors or their access to resources than about terrorism; and must be ''grounded in hope, not fear.'' A post-post-9/11 strategy must harness the forces of globalization while honestly addressing the growing ''perception of unfairness'' around the world; must actively promote, not just democracy, but ''a world of liberty under law''; and must renew multilateral instruments like the United Nations.
 In mainstream foreign-policy circles, Barack Obama is seen as the true bearer of this vision. ''There are maybe 200 people on the Democratic side who think about foreign policy for a living,'' as one such figure, himself unaffiliated with a campaign, estimates. ''The vast majority have thrown in their lot with Obama.'' Hillary Clinton's inner circle consists of the senior-most figures from her husband's second term in office -- the former secretary of state Madeleine Albright, the former national security adviser Sandy Berger and the former United Nations ambassador Richard Holbrooke. But drill down into one of Washington's foreign-policy hives, whether the Carnegie Endowment or the Brookings Institution or Georgetown University, and you're bound to hit Obama supporters. Most of them served in the Clinton administration, too, and thus might be expected to support Hillary Clinton. But many of these younger and generally more liberal figures have decamped to Obama. And they are ardent. As Ivo Daalder, a former National Security Council official under President Clinton who now heads up a team advising Obama on nonproliferation issues, puts it, ''There's a feeling that this is a guy who's going to help us transform the way America deals with the world.'' Ex-Clintonites in Obama's inner circle also include the president's former lawyer, Greg Craig, and Richard Danzig, his Navy secretary.
 The first of the Clinton people to notice this rising political star was Anthony Lake, national-security adviser in Bill Clinton's first term. Lake says that he was introduced to Obama in 2002 when the latter had just begun considering a run for a Senate seat. Impressed, he began contributing ideas. When Obama came to Washington as a senator and joined the Foreign Relations Committee, Lake continued to work with him on occasion. Like others, Lake was impressed not so much by Obama's policy prescriptions as by his temperament and intellectual habits. ''He has,'' Lake says, ''the kind of mind that works its way through complexities by listening and giving some edge of legitimacy to various points of view before he comes down on his, and that point of view embraces complexity.'' This awareness of complexity felt like a kind of politics itself and a repudiation of the Bush administration's categorical thinking.
 Obama spoke out against the impending war in Iraq in the fall of 2002; and those members of the Democratic establishment who, like Lake, also opposed the war came to view him as a kindred spirit. Susan Rice, a former assistant secretary of state in the Clinton administration who, along with Lake, heads up Obama's foreign-policy team, says, ''You were considered naive, wrong, weak, stupid to oppose that war.'' Hillary Clinton (and John Edwards) voted for the war. Obama's opposition to it showed Rice ''a willingness not to be bound by conventional wisdom and the well-trod path.''
 The deep sense of hopefulness that Obama inspires in his supporters has much to do with a life trajectory unique in the history of major presidential candidates. Obama has always been acutely conscious about the relationship between his personal arc and that of his country. In ''Dreams From My Father,'' published in 1995, before he ran for anything, Obama offered a vivid and strikingly introspective account of his knockabout childhood in Hawaii and Indonesia, as well as of a journey he made as an adult to Kenya, the homeland of his absent father. He presents himself in all his cultural hybridity -- African and American and Asian, black and white, infused with all-American hopefulness and with the reserve that comes of living on the receiving end of power. 
 One recurrent theme of the book is how very little the world, at least the world in which most people live, responds to our wishes or our ideals. Obama's Indonesian stepfather, Lolo, explains the rule of the jungle to the young boy: ''Men take advantage of weakness in other men.'' Obama's mother, an innocent abroad, is shocked to learn that Lolo was conscripted into that country's brutal repression of an insurgency and sent to the jungles of New Guinea, where he saw and did unspeakable things. In America, Obama writes, power was muted; in a place like Indonesia, it was ''undisguised, indiscriminate, naked, always fresh in the memory. Power had taken Lolo and yanked him back into line just when he thought he'd escaped. . . . That's how things were; you couldn't change it, you could just live by the rules, so simple once you learned them.''
 In 1981, Obama arrived at Columbia University, where he majored in international relations. He wrote his senior thesis on the North-South debate on trade then raging as part of the demand for a ''new international economic order.'' But he says that he was never much of a lefty. Obama offers himself as the representative of a new generation, free of the dogmas that still burden the Democratic Party. ''The Democrats have been stuck in the arguments of Vietnam,'' he said to me on the campaign plane, ''which means that either you're a Scoop Jackson Democrat or you're a Tom Hayden Democrat and you're suspicious of any military action. And that's just not my framework.'' 
 Indeed, for all his soaring idealism, Obama seems to have absorbed Lolo's teachings about the world's refractoriness. The foreign-policy figures whom he finds ''most compelling,'' he says, are the archrealists who shaped policy during the cold war, including the secretaries of state George C. Marshall and Dean Acheson and the diplomat-scholar George F. Kennan. ''What impresses me is not just the specifics of what they did,'' he said, ''but the approach they took to solve the problem, which is, if we have assets or tools to deal with foreign policy, we know that the most costly is the military tool, particularly in a nuclear era, so we want to apply all the other tools that are less costly.'' Obama said that he also admired the worldly pragmatists who served the first George Bush, including Brent Scowcroft, the national-security adviser: ''The whole Bush team, I think, was not entirely aware of the opportunities of this new world, but they had a very clear-eyed assessment.'' He has sought out the former secretary of state Colin Powell for counsel, and spoken with Scowcroft as well.
 Obama was sitting across from me in one of the leather bucket seats of the walnut-trimmed corporate jet the campaign had just leased. He has a look as cool and unruffled as his velvety tenor. He was tieless, as always, and his white shirt billowed around his trim frame; not even the tiniest crease marred his pale khaki linen pants. Because Obama has a loose and jokey manner -- fist-bumps, male hugs -- you do not immediately notice the inner gyroscope that keeps everything at a level. Even in public, he rarely changes the volume, speed or pitch of his voice. He does not hurry; he lopes. He seems to have a gift for husbanding his energy. He had woken early that morning in Manchester to play a game of pickup basketball against kids from Southern New Hampshire University. (The Obamas lost, 11-10.) The plane was heading to Des Moines; Obama had four campaign events scheduled for later that day. He was yawning, and he had pushed his salmon aside, half-eaten; but he spoke for about an hour before taking a nap.
 You feel, with Obama, that life experience, temperament and opinion are all of a piece. He is, on the one hand, an idealist and optimist who recoils from the zero-sum formula. If a single sentiment stands at the heart of his worldview, it's that, as he said in a speech earlier this year, ''the security of the American people is inextricably linked to the security of all people.'' What's good for others is good for us; there's no contradiction between idealism and realism. This may strike some as naive; and yet Obama shies away from the exclamatory rhetoric and grandiose formulations that have become George Bush's stock in trade. Bush's post-9/11 recognition that our own security depends on the well-being of people on the other side of the globe led him to propound the so-called Freedom Agenda and to promote democracy in the Middle East. Obama, though a more eager democracy promoter than his realist heroes were, is also far more tempered than Bush. He accuses the Bush administration of an ethnocentric fixation on elections and classic political rights. Instead, he argues: ''We have to be focused on what are the aspirations of the people in those countries. Once those aspirations are met, it opens up space for the kind of democratic regimes that we want.''
 Obama speaks with special passion about the need to change America's image in the world -- and not only by proving that it can elect a 46-year-old black man with roots in the Muslim world. He returns again and again to the question of what America means to the rest of the world. In one of his speeches, he observed that United States senators typically see ''the desperate faces'' of Darfur or Baghdad from the height of a helicopter. ''And it makes you stop and wonder,'' he added, ''when those faces look up at an American helicopter, do they feel hope, or do they feel hate?'' Obama would like to restore the era when people in capitals all over the world could go to the local American cultural center to read books and magazines, the way he could in Jakarta -- though now he would add English lessons and vocational training, and ''stories of America's Muslims and the strength they add to our country.'' He argues that we must give emerging powers like India, Brazil, Nigeria and South Africa ''a stake in upholding the international order.'' Obama is an unabashed fan of multilateral institutions. At an event in New Hampshire this summer, I heard him say, ''I want to go before the United Nations and say, 'America's back!' '' This is a bit too multilateral even for some of his advisers, who take a more skeptical view of the U.N. than he does. But for Obama, our willingness to be constrained by rules that govern others may take precedence over the rules themselves. 
 By the time he announced his candidacy earlier this year, Obama was already a media phenomenon thanks to his star turn at the 2004 Democratic convention and the publication of his second book, ''The Audacity of Hope.'' He moved in a bright nimbus of expectation; but he had arrived so recently on the national stage that the idea of a President Obama seemed almost impertinent. And Americans were all too familiar with the dangers of callow presidents. This spring, Obama tried to prove his readiness for office by laying out his foreign-policy views in a series of speeches and the obligatory essay in Foreign Affairs. He was obviously far more knowledgeable about the world, and far more nuanced in his understanding, than George Bush was in 2000. But was this junior senator with the boyish mien seasoned enough for the Oval Office? This was the threshold he had to cross. And Hillary Clinton wasted no time in planting the seeds of doubt.
 In the CNN/YouTube debate in early July, Obama was asked, ''Would you be willing to meet, separately, without preconditions, during the first year of your administration, in Washington or anywhere else, with the leaders of Iran, Syria, Venezuela, Cuba and North Korea, in order to bridge the gap that divides our countries?'' Obama replied, ''I would,'' and added that it was a ''disgrace'' that the Bush administration had refused on principle to do so. This was pretty standard Democratic rhetoric; but Clinton shot back, ''Well, I will not promise to meet with the leaders of these countries during my first year.'' She would ''pursue a very vigorous diplomacy'' but would never allow herself to be ''used for propaganda purposes'' by rogue leaders. The next day, sensing an opening, Clinton lashed into Obama's offer as ''irresponsible and frankly naive.'' Obama, in turn, accused his opponent of advocating a ''Bush-Cheney Lite'' brand of diplomacy and insisted that our standing had fallen ''because people think that the United States wants to dictate across the world instead of cooperate across the world.''
 Here was a false debate that was nevertheless extremely telling. When criticizing Bush rather than Obama, Clinton mocked the administration's unwillingness to engage with enemies. ''Direct negotiations are not a sign of weakness,'' she said in a 2006 speech to the Council on Foreign Relations. ''They're a sign of leadership.'' She advocated direct talks with both North Korea and Iran, observing in the latter case that our willingness to talk tells the Iranian people that ''our quarrel is with their leaders, not with them'' and shows the international community that ''we are pursuing every available peaceful avenue.'' And only a few days before the debate Obama said that he would set conditions before meeting with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. In short, you would need a very fine instrument to calculate the difference between Clinton's and Obama's willingness to talk to bad guys. The dispute looked like classic political posturing, with Clinton trying to box her opponent into a frame reading, ''Not Ready for Leadership in This Grave Era,'' and Obama fighting back with ''A Prisoner of Old Thinking.''
 The post-debate spin was that Clinton won the battle of the narrative frames; but a CNN focus group concluded that the dust-up was Obama's best moment. And Obama found that he was as comfortable with his side of the debate as Clinton was with hers. ''It accentuated a difference between the two of them that I'm not sure either of them fully appreciated beforehand,'' said Samantha Power, the author and Harvard professor, who is another one of Obama's chief advisers. ''It was orienting and galvanizing.'' But the difference between them wasn't really a matter of preconditions and propaganda points. The debate was ''orienting'' because it exposed the very different orientations of the two -- one toward tough-mindedness and resolve, the other toward transparency and dialogue; the one toward the peril that we face, the other toward opportunities we must explore. How you felt about the debate had to do with how you felt about the world. 
 Obama may have found the debate galvanizing, but only one of them could win the battle of the frames. And Clinton was, at the very least, not losing -- which seemed very much to be her strategy. In early August, Obama gave a speech in Washington titled ''The War We Need to Win.'' Obama proposed to ''increase both the numbers and capabilities of our diplomats, development experts and other civilians who can work alongside our military'' in places threatened by extremism; to help weak states build ''independent judicial systems, honest police forces'' and transparent financial systems; to double foreign assistance by 2012; to close Guantanamo and end torture. 
 But this was also the speech in which Obama vowed to go after ''high-value terrorist targets'' in Pakistan if President Pervez Musharraf failed to act. And the headlines the next day were all about Obama's strategic embrace of saber rattling. Mitt Romney cracked that Obama had ''gone from Jane Fonda to Dr. Strangelove in one week.'' Clinton noted primly that ''you shouldn't always say everything you think if you're running for president, because it has consequences across the world.'' And the Obama campaign winced. ''The fact that Pakistan came so soon after 'talking to dictators' was just unfortunate,'' as one adviser told me. Another fumes that ''it's just so frustrating that he gives these substantive speeches and it's like a tree falling in the forest.'' The story line was supposed to be that Obama, unlike Clinton, had a comprehensive and nuanced counterterrorism policy. But it wasn't getting through. 
 The battle of the competing narratives grew even more one-sided the next day, when Obama answered an out-of-left-field question by flatly ruling out the use of nuclear weapons against terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Pakistan and then awkwardly trying to footnote his categorical answer. Even though such an act is all but unthinkable, presidents typically keep their options open by refusing to take even the unthinkable ones off the table. Clinton, as always, had the Right Answer at the ready: ''Presidents should be careful at all times in discussing the use and nonuse of nuclear weapons.'' She didn't have to add that taking options off the table was naive and frankly irresponsible. This time, no one in the Obama campaign thought they had won. Samantha Power offered to draw up a set of talking points. Each of the three episodes, Power argued, pitted ''conventional wisdom'' against ''new ideas.'' Do we really want a president who will sustain the pretense that we will obliterate a chunk of Pakistan in order to take out a training camp? ''We should judge presidential candidates on their judgment and their plans,'' the spine-stiffening memo noted, ''not on their ability to recite platitudes.'' 
 The foreign-policy establishment, whose members actually read speeches, was sympathetic to Obama's side. Dennis Ross, the former Middle East negotiator and author of a recent book on diplomacy, says of the willingness to negotiate, ''You don't want to make yourself the issue so that it becomes harder to get others to join you,'' though he adds that it's sometimes prudent to first ''prepare the ground'' with third parties who can explore the usefulness of discussion. Ross, who has spoken to many of the candidates and endorsed none, is unequivocal on Pakistan, saying, ''If Pakistan won't act, then you have to, and you need to condition them to understand that by saying so publicly.'' Obama also gained support from some unexpected quarters. In late August, Zbigniew Brzezinski, the hawkish national-security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, was asked to score the contest between Obama and Clinton. Brzezinski, who opposed the Iraq war and has become a fierce critic of the Bush administration, said: ''I think Obama is clearly more effective and has the upper hand. He has a sense of what is historically relevant and what is needed from the United States in relationship to the world. . . . The senator from New York talks in very conventional terms, and I don't think the country needs to go back to what we had eight years ago.'' 
 Obama was doing everything except winning. Tony Lake, whose career goes back to Vietnam, says he has worked on campaigns, like Ed Muskie's in 1972, in which the candidate was cautious to a fault. Obama, he says, never shies away from stating his convictions; and unlike Muskie's opponent, George McGovern, Obama has much of the establishment on his side. So what do you do? You show that tough-minded folks, and above all ones with stripes on their shoulders, support Obama, who began campaigning in Iowa with Brzezinski, Gen. Merrill McPeak, the former Air Force chief of staff, and Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, who recently retired after serving in Iraq. And? ''You keep working on this and hope it gets through after a while,'' Lake says. 
 And you start hammering your opponent. Obama long planned to mark the fifth anniversary of his speech opposing the war, which fell on Oct. 2. He would take on Clinton about as frontally as he could without mentioning her name, a piece of campaign etiquette that he consistently observed. He planned to address a rally, as he had five years earlier, but in a conference call a week or so beforehand, Obama said he wanted to give another policy speech instead. ''There are those,'' he said in the speech in Chicago, ''who offer up easy answers'' -- for instance, that the president and his gang botched the war. In fact, he went on, the American people were being failed by ''a foreign-policy elite that largely boarded the bandwagon for war'' -- an odd comment for someone so deeply admired by the foreign-policy elite. That same conventional thinking, he declared in a rhetorical hop-skip-and-jump, ''measures experience only by the years you've been in Washington, not by your time spent serving in the wider world.'' Then, taking a leaf from the Samantha Power memo, Obama reprised the Three Squabbles as if they defined the difference between himself and Clinton -- between conviction and cynicism, the future and the past, hope and fear. His chief protagonist was no longer George Bush, but rather some supposed entity of which Bush and Hillary Clinton are equally a part.
 It was a hard-hitting speech; but about an hour before Obama delivered it, the Clinton campaign released figures showing that it had outraised Obama in the previous quarter -- a juicy plum for political reporters. And so yet another tree fell silently in the forest. When I asked one of the ex-Clintonites on the Obama team how he felt about this brilliant act of gamesmanship, he couldn't even get out a complete sentence. He said, ''It was, ah . . . it was, ah . . . to type.''
 Obama's advisers argue that he has plenty of time left to show that he is the candidate of substance and of new thinking, and Clinton of political calculation and Bush-Cheney Lite. In the meantime, though, they blame their failure to break through on what they see as a combination of Clinton's inspired cynicism and the myopia of a press corps addled by tactics and poll numbers. They are, of course, less inclined to think that the public has heard both sides and decided it prefers the other one. But that banal explanation may actually be true. A CBS News poll in August found that while far more Democrats believed that Obama would find ''new ways of solving the country's problems'' than would Clinton, she received a roughly equal score on trust in her ability to handle foreign crises and a commanding advantage -- 59 percent approval versus Obama's 29 percent -- on the question of having the ''right experience to be president.'' Three-quarters of Democrats said they believed Clinton could win the presidency. Obama languished at 54 percent; and 37 percent mentioned his inexperience as the chief problem. 
 Those are startling numbers, considering that the overwhelming majority of Democrats now think that Clinton was wrong and Obama right on Iraq, the great foreign crisis of our generation. Obama has ridden this distinction as hard as he can. But perhaps anger over Iraq is less salient politically than fear about terrorism. And if that's so, voters may be more inclined to take refuge in Clinton's tough-mindedness than in Obama's multipronged Swiss Army knife. Six years have passed since the terrorist attacks, but it seems that, psychologically, we remain inside their fearful penumbra. 
 And on this visceral question of fear and threat, the candidates differ greatly. Republicans like Rudolph W. Giuliani promise to assuage our worries by taking the offensive; John Edwards has described the ''war on terror'' as a slogan rather than a strategy and characterized the supreme goal as reclaiming ''the moral high ground that defined our foreign policy for much of the last century.'' These are the twin poles of the terrorism debate -- bellicosity and benevolence. Democrats are not of one mind on the question. Obama continues to use the expression ''war on terror'' but shares Edwards's substantive views. He says he believes that while a small core of jihadists must be confronted with superior force, the Islamic world generally is in the position of the faces looking wonderingly at the American helicopter, susceptible to the instruments of soft power. He has pledged to convene a forum in the Middle East with regional heads of state soon after he is elected. On the other hand, centrists like Will Marshall, president of the Progressive Policy Institute, are skeptical about the efficacy of soft power in this case. Obama, says Marshall, appears to believe that ''the threat we face is an Al Qaeda threat -- a tiny minority of malignant criminals who have absolutely no public support.'' In fact, says Marshall, ''Al Qaeda has broad support in the Islamic world,'' and Salafism, the extremist branch of Sunni Islam, ''is in the ascendant.'' And Hillary Clinton, who has expressed qualified support for the Bush administration's confrontational policies on Iran, has positioned herself carefully to Obama's right on the subject.
 Is Obama, then, too soft for this hard moment -- too young, too nice, too worried about what others think of us? Is the whole issue of ''experience'' really a proxy for tough-mindedness? When I told Obama that Joseph Nye thought he was soft-power incarnate but nevertheless leaned toward Clinton, he nodded, and then coolly shot back: ''It is interesting to me that this conversation does not come up with any of the other candidates. It does not come up with respect to John Edwards. On the Republican side, the degree to which Rudy Giuliani was validated almost as a wartime president was fascinating to me.'' And what about Mitt Romney? And Fred Thompson?
 '' 'The Hunt for Red October,' '' Obama's communications director, Robert Gibbs, helpfully suggested.
 Obama wasn't done. ''Hillary gets a unique pass on this issue,'' he went on, ''not by virtue of her service in the Senate but by virtue of the idea that through osmosis she gets it from Bill. And they've been actively pushing that story.'' This was obviously a very sore point. 
 Obama finally leaned back to nap, and I went across the aisle. I was telling Gibbs my theory that Americans might be looking for a president whose protection they can huddle under when Obama opened an eye. And as he resumed the conversation, the frustration of months of pedaling hard and getting nowhere began to show. He wanted to know what kind of experience Clinton supposedly had that he didn't, and what kind of crisis she was supposedly better suited to than he, and why ''toughness'' had become a stand-in for experience, and how Clinton could get credit for it when she failed to stand up to Bush on the Iraq vote. We batted all this around. Finally he said, ''Ask Nye why Hillary's paint-by-the-numbers foreign policy makes her more qualified to handle a crisis when for most of our history our crises have come from using force when we shouldn't, not by failing to use force.'' I promised that I would.
 And I did. Nye is writing a book about leadership, and he said he had learned that at moments of crisis a leader's key attribute was the ''tacit knowledge,'' usually acquired from prior experience, that allows him (or her) to ''shape the crisis by asking the right questions.'' I said that Obama wanted to know how Clinton had acquired this experience. ''By osmosis of going through this,'' Nye said, though he conceded that he wasn't sure tacit knowledge could in fact be acquired osmotically. And he added that he had great respect for Obama. ''It is,'' he said, ''a 51-49 type of distinction.'' 
 Obama concedes that he has a problem. ''We have not fully made our case yet,'' he admits. ''I think the American people know in their gut that we need significant change, and I think they'd like to believe what I'm saying is possible.'' But they need, says this former law-school professor, ''a permission structure.'' They need to know that they'll be safe with Barack Obama. Or unsafe with Hillary Clinton.
 Two months before the presidential primaries begin, it still looks like a hard sell.

 Law and Judgment Inside the Bush Administration. 
 By Jack Goldsmith.

 Three years after the American invasion of Iraq, after endless searches had found no sign of weapons of mass destruction, President Bush still believed that Saddam Hussein had had them. He expressed that conviction repeatedly to his chief of staff, Andrew Card, until Card left the White House in April 2006. 
 So writes Robert Draper in his unusual biography of George W. Bush. It is unusual because Draper, a national correspondent for GQ magazine, was given extraordinary access to this press-averse president and his aides, including six private meetings with Bush, surely in the belief that he would be a friendly biographer. Draper is friendly, at times admiring. But he also unhesitatingly supplies devastating evidence of the characteristics that have helped to produce the disasters of the Bush presidency. 
 ''Dead Certain,'' the title, conveys one of those characteristics. Bush knows he is right. When facts turn out to get in the way, he brushes them off. When ''Mission Accomplished'' turned sour in Iraq, when various supposed bench marks of success did not stop the bloodshed, the president remained utterly confident of victory. He was sure, Draper writes, that ''history would acquit him.'' 
 These are some of the words Draper uses in discussing Bush: ''certitude,'' ''intransigence,'' ''his obstinate streak,'' ''compulsive optimism.'' ''I truly believe we're in the process of shaping history for the good,'' Bush told Draper early this year. ''I know, I firmly believe, that decisions I have made were necessary to secure the country.'' 
 At the time of that interview, February 2007, Republicans had lost control of both houses of Congress. ''Americans had soured on the president and his war,'' Draper writes. ''The First Optimist had made pessimists out of them.'' But the president did not change. ''What had to be believed, he believed.'' 
 The way Bush sold the country on going to war against Iraq is well traced by Draper in quotations from speeches in late 2002. Saddam ''is a man who would likely team up with Al Qaeda,'' Bush said on Nov. 3. Later the same day: ''This is a man who has had contacts with Al Qaeda. ... He's the kind of guy that would love nothing more than to train terrorists and provide arms to terrorists.'' The next day: ''Imagine a scenario where an Al Qaeda-type organization uses Iraq as an arsenal.'' And repeatedly, Draper says, Bush used the line: ''This is a man who told the world he wouldn't have weapons of mass destruction, promised he wouldn't have them. He's got them.'' 
 Draper says bluntly that ''Bush wasn't relying on intelligence to buttress his claims of Saddam's dark fantasies of plotting attacks on America with Al Qaeda, or of direct contact with Al Qaeda. For no such intelligence existed.'' But the scary talk worked. In time millions of Americans believed, in the teeth of reality, that there were Iraqis on the planes that struck the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001.
 The other half of the salesmanship for war was the contention that the Iraqi people would welcome American invaders. We are familiar with the talk that they would greet us with flowers. But Draper has a telling quotation that I had not seen before. Vice President Dick Cheney is trying to persuade Dick Armey, the Republican House majority leader, who was skeptical about a war on Iraq, in a private meeting in September 2002: ''We have great information. They're going to welcome us. It'll be like the American Army going through the streets of Paris. They're sitting there ready to form a new government. The people will be so happy with their freedoms that we'll probably back ourselves out of there within a month or two.'' 
 An abysmal ignorance of Iraq and Islam underlay such beliefs. The Economist, which still doggedly supports the Iraq effort, wrote recently (in an article not about Bush but about former Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose support for the war had some calling him Bush's poodle), ''Only an historical illiterate would have assumed that the divided Iraqis were bound to thank their invading liberators and coalesce in democratic government.'' One has to wonder whether George W. Bush had heard about the division between Shiites and Sunnis when he decided on war.
 Whatever one's view of the possible benefits of the war, the costs have been enormous. More than 3,500 Americans have been killed so far, and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. Millions of Iraqis, among them much of the educated elite, have fled the country. The one clear winner from the invasion and the consequent civil strife has been neighboring Iran, whose fellow Shiites dominate the Iraqi government. Far from suppressing terrorism, the war has aroused widespread anti-Americanism and bred a new generation of terrorists.
 Some Bush critics, starting with his first presidential campaign, have put him down as stupid. He is not stupid. He was an effective, if ruthless, candidate. Some who have dealt with him as president -- people outside his circle -- have found him informed when he was really engaged with a problem. But his attention to many issues has been fitful. ''We've got a great chance to establish a Palestinian state,'' he said in a 2004 press conference, ''and I intend to use the next four years to spend the capital of the United States on such a state.'' But for much of the next several years the Bush administration was disengaged from the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
 Bush seems to lack the intellectual curiosity that makes for an interesting mind. For all of Draper's admirable effort to paint a full picture, warts and all, it is a bit of a struggle to read more than 400 pages about George W. Bush.
 Draper admires what he calls the ''affable compassion'' of Bush as a candidate in 2000, before he turned out to be a hard-line conservative on both economics -- lower taxes for the rich -- and social issues like stem cell research and abortion. His folksy Texas style, even his clumsiness with words, are attractive to many Americans. His occasional locker-room lingo is more natural than Richard Nixon's awkward efforts. ''We're kicking ass'' in Iraq, he told Australia's deputy prime minister this year.
 But there is another, less attractive part of the Bush persona: the mean-minded frat boy. At the 1992 Republican National Convention, Senator John McCain was about to speak for the re-election of Bush 41 when young George came up to him and said, according to Draper, ''You've gotta hammer Clinton on the draft dodging.'' That from a man who had weaved his way out of serving in Vietnam. McCain replied, ''Sorry, that's not my thing.'' 
 On Jan. 31, 2001, soon after taking office, Bush held a cabinet meeting. When he entered the room, one chair was empty: the secretary of state's. ''Lock the door,'' Bush said. A few minutes later Colin Powell could be heard trying the doorknob. The room ''erupted with laughter.'' Then Bush ordered the door unlocked. He ''had made his point,'' Draper says; Powell was ''not the big dog any longer.'' That the president of the United States would want to show how important he was by humiliating Colin Powell speaks volumes. 
 Draper's thesis is that the immature Bush was transformed by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11. ''All the man's undersized, self-conscious ways -- the smirk, the reedy defensiveness, the exaggerated imperiousness of his executive stroll -- had collapsed into this new persona. ... He was a war president now, and perfectly at ease with the role.'' 
 But there is a great failing in Draper's account of Bush as a war president. He says next to nothing about what I think will be seen, along with the Iraq war, as the most important legacy of Bush's presidency: his effort to enlarge the unilateral power of the president. Invoking the ''war on terror'' as a reason, Bush has worked relentlessly to unbalance the balance of powers -- the separation of the government into three branches -- that James Madison, the father of the Constitution, thought was its fundamental safeguard against abuse of power. Thus Bush ordered the National Security Agency to wiretap Americans on international telephone calls, in violation of a criminal statute requiring that the agency first obtain warrants from a special court. Congress had spoken with unmistakable clarity. When it forbids a specific action, Justice Robert Jackson said in his much-noted opinion in the steel seizure case of 1952, executive power is at its ''lowest ebb.''
 And Draper does not discuss the most profound example of Bush's extreme assertion of executive power: torture. Not the occasional mistreatment of prisoners by an out-of-line American, but deliberate violation of the obligation on the United States by treaty (the Geneva Conventions) and domestic law not to torture prisoners or subject them to ''cruel,'' ''inhuman'' or ''degrading'' treatment.
 A formal 2002 opinion by the Justice Department, accepted by the White House counsel at the time, Alberto Gonzales, defined ''torture'' to the vanishing point, only as the infliction of pain equivalent to the pain that accompanies the loss of a bodily organ ''or even death.'' The opinion said the president had supreme power to order the torture of prisoners, and neither Congress nor treaties ratified by the United States could stop him.
 n Iraqi major general, among others, was tortured to death by his American captors. Dozens of prisoners at Abu Ghraib were sexually humiliated and tormented. Unknown numbers were held in secret C.I.A. prisons in Europe and sent to countries that routinely torture, in what was blandly called ''extraordinary rendition.''
 In the C.I.A. prisons, men were subjected to waterboarding, a form of simulated drowning. At the prison in Guantanamo Bay, men had to endure extreme heat and cold, unrelenting loud music, sleep deprivation, forced nakedness and ''stress positions.'' All this has been justified by President Bush as necessary for the effective interrogation of prisoners, to find out dangerous terrorist plans. But prisoners who are mistreated to make them talk give unreliable information, as experts on interrogation know. They will say anything to make the pain stop.
 The use of torture and cruel treatment has actually hurt American national security. It has aroused outrage around the world, alarming friends and allies, depriving the United States of its reputation as a country that does not resort to inhumanity.
 What Draper does not discuss -- the record of Bush and his lawyers on torture -- is grippingly examined by Jack Goldsmith in ''The Terror Presidency.'' Goldsmith is a conservative Harvard law professor who was assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel for nine months in 2003-4. That is where official government opinions on the law are prepared.
 John Yoo, a deputy assistant attorney general in the office, prepared the 2002 opinion defining torture narrowly and asserting that the president had supreme power to order its use. Goldsmith withdrew that opinion and replaced it with a much more modest one. It took courage to do that, because he was treated as a traitor by some in the administration -- notably David Addington, then Vice President Cheney's counsel, now his chief of staff. And it has taken courage to write this book.
 Goldsmith does not criticize the torture opinion and other actions as beyond the law. Rather, he argues that they were bad policy, driven by an ideological view that even consulting Congress would impinge on the presidency. Goldsmith believed that bringing Congress in would give the president what he needed and strengthen his legal basis. But Addington asked, ''Why are you trying to give away the president's power?'' He accused Goldsmith of making Americans vulnerable to terrorism.
 Yoo was, with Addington, a prime mover for supreme presidential power. (He was so reliable in pronouncing lawful what Bush wanted to do that Attorney General John Ashcroft, displaying an unheralded wit, called him Dr. Yes.) Goldsmith was a friend of Yoo's and, in my judgment, goes easy on him. He says Yoo's opinion, in its narrow definition of torture, ''didn't seem even in the ballpark.'' But he credits Yoo with sincerity in his legal views and says Yoo has ''enormous personal charm.'' If so, charm did not alleviate the brutality of the interrogation tactics unleashed in part by Yoo's opinion.
 In an interesting comparison with Franklin D. Roosevelt's sweeping power in World War II, Goldsmith says Roosevelt relied on persuasion, bargaining, compromise. ''The Bush administration has operated on an entirely different concept of power that relies on minimal deliberation, unilateral action and legalistic defense. This approach largely eschews politics: the need to explain, to justify, to convince, to get people on board, to compromise.'' 
 Goldsmith's arguments are the more convincing because they are not premised on traditional liberal or civil libertarian views. For example, he approves the detention of suspected terrorists in Guantanamo. But he warns that there is a ''big question'' as to whether all the people held there as members of Al Qaeda or the Taliban were in fact members. President Bush put aside the Geneva requirement that their status be determined by a ''competent tribunal'' and himself made a ''group status determination.'' Goldsmith calls this ''an inadequate response to concerns that particular individuals were not enemy fighters but instead were innocent farmers scooped up in Afghanistan.'' 
 The Bush administration has tried to exclude not just Congress but the courts from decisions relating to the ''war on terror.'' When it detained two American citizens as ''enemy combatants'' and held them in solitary confinement without charge and without access to counsel, its lawyers first argued that the courts could not even consider lawsuits filed on their behalf. Detention without trial, in short, was beyond any outside review.
 The torture issue has come up several times in embarrassing ways for the administration: when the pictures from Abu Ghraib appeared, and again when torture opinions were published despite efforts to keep them secret. Each time Bush has said, ''We don't torture.'' Exactly. In the Bush administration, whatever we do is not torture.
 Senator McCain, who was tortured in North Vietnam, pushed through Congress a bill prohibiting torture by the American military or the cruel, inhuman and degrading tactics forbidden by the Geneva Conventions. President Bush signed it into law -- but with a signing statement saying he reserved the right not to carry out provisions that intruded on the president's constitutional power.
 Goldsmith's story has ended in a terrible irony. The New York Times reported recently that Alberto Gonzales, as attorney general in 2005, approved a secret opinion that said such tactics as head slapping, simulated drowning and exposure to frigidtemperatures, separately or in combination, did not constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment of prisoners. David Addington won. And America's vision of itself as a country of laws, not men, lost.
 There is a profound oddity in the position of the presidentialists like Yoo, Cheney and Addington. Legal conservatives like to say that the Constitution should be read according to its original intent. But if there is anything clear about the intentions of the framers, it is that they did not intend to create an executive with more prerogative power than George III had. Not even in time of war.
 Remember that the framers gave Congress the power to declare war and ''make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces.'' Madison wrote:
 ''In no part of the Constitution is more wisdom to be found than in the clause which confides the question of war or peace to the legislature, and not to the executive department. ... War is in fact the true nurse of executive aggrandizement. In war, a physical force is to be created; and it is the executive will which is to direct it. In war, the public treasures are to be unlocked; and it is the executive hand which is to dispense them. ... It is in war, finally, that laurels are to be gathered, and it is the executive brow they are to encircle. The strongest passions and most dangerous weaknesses of the human breast; ambition, avarice, vanity, the honorable or venial love of fame, are all in conspiracy against the desire and duty of peace.''

HEADLINE: Incentives, to Fight the Doldrums

BYLINE: By VALERIE COTSALAS

 BODY:
DEVELOPERS in central Long Island are increasingly resorting to incentives to lure buyers. Nassau and Suffolk Counties are both affected, though new units in western Suffolk have been particularly slow to sell in the current sluggish real estate market. 
 ''We're concerned, so we've reduced our prices,'' said Elliot Monter, whose development firm, Holiday Organization, builds the Hamlet Estates gated communities on Long Island. He is cutting prices on some of his newest homes in St. James, in Suffolk, by 20 percent, though he won't be lowering them at his newest Nassau County development, in Jericho.
 Potential buyers at the Hamlet Estates at St. James, on Route 347 at Moriches Road, will be introduced to a new scaled-down 3,300-square-foot model; the eight other models all start at 4,000 square feet. Prices will be scaled back, to $795,900, or 20 percent lower than the starting price of $1 million for the bigger models. 
 In addition, 22 of the larger homes, as yet unbuilt, have been reduced by $100,000, or about 10 percent, Mr. Monter said. Those homes now range from $908,000 to $1.045 million.
 During one October weekend, Pulte Homes of New York, which is building six communities in Suffolk County and two in Nassau County, offered incentives worth as much as $50,000 to buyers reserving homes. The communities range in size from a condominium development in Oceanside with units starting at $364,900 to a single-family-home development in Mount Sinai with prices starting at $625,000. 
 Most of the incentives are tied to the company's mortgage arm, the Pulte Mortgage Corporation, according to Bruce Orr, vice president for marketing of the Long Island division.
 They include covering closing costs, upgrades on home features and ''living free for six months'' -- which means the company pays buyers using Pulte financing an amount equal to six months of mortgage payments and taxes.
 That strategy gives buyers breathing room when they have to sell their current home to buy a new one. It also reduces the impact of tighter home financing restrictions, Mr. Orr said, adding, ''When we can control the financing side of the business, we have a much higher likelihood of getting the buyer to the closing table.''
 According to Pearl Kamer, chief economist for the Long Island Association, builders' incentives will most likely continue ''for some time to come,'' especially with homes priced from $750,000 to $1.2 million lingering longest on the market.
 In that price range, Dr. Kamer explained, buyers often need ''jumbo'' mortgages, which exceed $417,000 and are not guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration. Investors are ''shying away'' from taking on the extra risk of those loans, she added, and banks raise interest rates for carrying the risk. 
 Creditworthy buyers in this range ''can get a jumbo mortgage,'' Dr. Kamer said, ''but only at an exorbitant interest rate.'' 
 In Suffolk, the time spent marketing a house for sale was 23.9 percent longer in the third quarter this year than for the corresponding period last year, according to Jonathan Miller, executive vice president and director of research for Radar Logic, a real estate data analysis company.
 Nick Cassis of the Biti Development Company is one entrepreneur feeling the effects of that lag. Uneasy about market conditions, he said, he wished he had models completed for the seven styles of single-family homes in his 64-unit development in the Suffolk community of Eastport. Prices range from $650,000 to $1.2 million.
 ''A couple of years ago people were buying from plans,'' Mr. Cassis said. Now ''you have to have a model.'' Eastport is a year-round community a short drive west of Westhampton Beach.
 Mr. Cassis says he is hoping to lure buyers to the community, called Hamptons Estates, with convenient extras like a clubhouse, tennis courts, walking trails, a dog run, and hourly jitney service to Southampton, Sag Harbor, Westhampton beaches and shopping. 
 He is also including free upgrades: a fireplace, expensive appliances, granite counters in the kitchen and full basements. 
 Just over the Nassau side of the county line, at the Preserve at Woodbury on Jericho Turnpike, 10 of 32 new town houses priced from $1.25 million to $1.45 million are for sale.
 To stimulate interest, the developer is offering upgrades, including an elevator and a cook's kitchen with designer appliances like Wolff ranges and SubZero refrigerators, according to Josephine Stockli, the Coldwell Banker broker who is handling the listings.
 Nearby, at the Horizons development in Jericho, the developer David Marom held a weekend carnival for families in mid-October to showcase five houses under construction. The homes range in size from 3,300 to 4,500 square feet but are all priced around $1.38 million. They come with free upgrades like fireplaces, elevators, full basements, stucco facades, and credits for other options.
 But farther west into Nassau, things seem slightly healthier. Michael Dubb, who is in the third of seven phases of building his 750-unit Meadowbrook Pointe development for people 55 and older, said he had sold 300 of the 375 under construction. The 25,000-square-foot clubhouse is also complete. Selling the units, Mr. Dubb said, ''hasn't been an issue at all.''
 Granted, he could charge more and make a bigger profit if the market were stronger, he acknowledged, but he has not lowered his original prices. 
 Dr. Kamer, the economist, says she expects an average decline in home prices of 10 to 15 percent each year until 2009 or 2010, when she believes the market will stabilize, then improve, with modest annual increases of 2 or 3 percent, ''our historical average'' on Long Island. But in the $750,000-to-$1.2-million range, Dr. Kamer said, price declines could reach 25 or 30 percent.
 ''The high-end real estate will come down more than other types of real estate,'' she predicted, noting the volume of homes built by speculators that have been lingering on the market on the East End. ''Whenever you have a high degree of speculation, where people don't live in the homes but want to flip them, I think those home prices will come down most significantly.''

HEADLINE: Demon Barber, Meat Pies and All, Sings on Screen

BYLINE: By SYLVIANE GOLD

 BODY:
SOME time in 1980, during the five months that the grim and glorious musical ''Sweeney Todd'' played the Theater Royal Drury Lane, a California college student visiting London bought a ticket. And another and another and another.
 Tim Burton, obsessive watcher of horror movies and a worshiper of Vincent Price, had discovered ''The Demon Barber of Fleet Street,'' not to mention Stephen Sondheim. And after stewing in his imagination on and off for some 25 years, that encounter has been channeled into Mr. Burton's new film version, scheduled to arrive Dec. 21, with Johnny Depp as Sweeney, Helena Bonham Carter as Mrs. Lovett and the smoke-blackened streets of Victorian London as the setting for their danse macabre.
 Any way you slice it, it's a gamble.
 Transferring a stage work to the screen is always dodgy; for musicals, so dependent on the artificial world of the proscenium, the risks are multiplied. To further complicate things Mr. Burton entrusted the lead roles in this operatic, difficult-to-sing work, which scooped up no less than seven Tony Awards in 1979, to two movie stars whose vocal abilities, like those of all but one of the supporting players, were untested. (They include Sacha Baron Cohen, as the competing barber Pirelli.) 
 There's also the little matter of the R-rated plot, which revels in the throat-cutting, meat-chopping proclivities of a serial killer whose victims are funneled from a trick barber's chair into a giant meat grinder, processed and then baked into tasty little meat pies by his cooperative landlady. 
 Even less bloody shows by Mr. Sondheim have not been served well by the movies. Some -- ''Pacific Overtures,'' say, ''Sunday in the Park With George'' or ''Assassins''-- are so intrinsically theatrical in conception that they seem virtually unfilmable. Of the others for which he has also written both music and lyrics, only two, ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' (1966) and ''A Little Night Music'' (1978), had made it to celluloid (and not very happily) before Mr. Burton tackled ''Sweeney.'' 
 ''Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street'' may seem a more likely candidate for film success, given its origins in melodrama and Grand Guignol, the slasher movies of the 19th century. Still, ''It took courage and a certain lunatic leap of faith to think we could really bring this wild beast to the screen,'' the screenwriter, John Logan, said via e-mail.
 Mr. Burton was not making films when he first saw ''Sweeney Todd.'' But he was struck, he recalled in a recent telephone interview, by how cinematic it was. Propelled by Mr. Sondheim's extensive underscoring, Harold Prince's production flowed from scene to scene within a cavernous metal cage, using revolving set pieces housing Mrs. Lovett's pie shop, Sweeney's tonsorial establishment and the show's other locations. When Mr. Burton's film career took off, in the late '80s, he approached Mr. Sondheim about a film .
 ''I said fine,'' Mr. Sondheim said by telephone recently. ''Then he went off and did other things.'' 
 Mr. Burton explained, ''You get sort of sidetracked.'' But, he said, it was all for the best. ''Back then, I didn't really know Johnny.'' And he hadn't yet met Ms. Bonham Carter, with whom he now lives. (They are expecting their second child next month.) 
 Around five years ago, he said, he stumbled on an old drawing he had made of Sweeney Todd and Mrs. Lovett. To his surprise, ''they kind of looked like Johnny and Helena.'' The wheels began to turn. ''Those kinds of things mean something to me,'' Mr. Burton said. ''Johnny had gotten to the point where he was the right age. There was something about it that felt really right, even though I didn't know if he could sing.'' 
 He gave Mr. Depp the album and asked, ''Would you ever think about doing something like this?'' He said Mr. Depp listened and responded, ''I may sound like a strangled cat.'' Mr. Burton took that as a yes. ''If he didn't think he could do it, he would have said no.''
 Mr. Burton and Mr. Depp had already created a gallery of memorable weirdos, starting in 1990 with the unfortunate adolescent of ''Edward Scissorhands'' and continuing with the transvestite film director at the center of ''Ed Wood'' and the oddly epicene Willy Wonka in ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.'' Mr. Depp's Sweeney isn't a regular guy either. With a Susan Sontag patch of white streaking his pompadour, ghostly skin and distraught eyes, this Sweeney is both wretched and mad. ''He needed to have a look that would say a lot about what he'd been through,'' Mr. Depp said by telephone. 
 What he'd been through, what turned him into a revenge machine, was a trumped-up conviction that enabled an evil judge (played by Alan Rickman) to destroy his family. Mr. Burton's take on the material had been formed when he'd seen the London production. ''I always felt it was like a silent movie with music in it -- those old black and white horror movies.''
 He talked with Mr. Depp, also a silents fan, about the approach; their touchstones were Lon Chaney, Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre, especially, Mr. Depp said, Lorre's ''creepy but sympathetic'' surgeon in the 1935 thriller ''Mad Love.'' The influence of silent film permeates the movie, from the chiaroscuro lighting to the we-had-faces close-ups. ''Johnny in front of his victims with the razor is almost like a ballet dancer, dancing around them,'' said Richard D. Zanuck, a producer. 
 Mr. Burton asked the designer, Dante Ferretti, to recreate not Victorian London but horror-movie London. Mr. Ferretti, who began his career working with Fellini, first visited the relevant neighborhoods around Fleet Street, he said. ''Then we did it a little bit more frightening, more dark, more interesting.'' 
 Initially Mr. Burton had planned to make the film with few sets and lots of computerized effects. He ended up doing just the opposite. ''This is a musical,'' he said. ''Having sets helps you, it helps the actors, it helps the crew get into the right frame of mind. Just having people singing in front of a green screen seemed more disconnected.'' 
 Mr. Depp began performing in rock bands as a teenager. But ''never, ever, did I ever want to sing,'' he insisted. ''Singers always got too much attention. I was always happier playing my guitar in the dark.''
 The plan was for him to work with a vocal coach, ''do the scales and all that stuff.'' But ''it started to dawn on me that I knew what Sweeney sounded like before, and I knew that it was up to me to go far away from that,'' he said. ''He needed to be, for lack of a better word, slightly more punk rock.'' 
 He studied the songs as he was filming the third installment of the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' series in Palmdale, Calif. -- ''two hours to work and two hours back listening constantly, learning the melodies in the car.''
 Mike Higham, the film's music producer, said that isn't quite as easy as it sounds. ''With Stephen's music the melodies don't roll off the tongue,'' he said. ''They run around the scale. It's hard for actors to get into the pockets of where the music really is.''
 Part of Mr. Higham's job was cutting the music to fit the film, which follows closely the contours of the original show. Mr. Sondheim summed up the operative principle: ''In the theater you can sing for three or four minutes even though there's nothing happening. On film you want to keep things moving.''
 Some songs, including the show's framing number, ''The Ballad of Sweeney Todd,'' were cut. Others, like ''Green Finch and Linnet Bird'' and ''God, That's Good!'' were shortened. Mr. Higham sent his changes to Mr. Sondheim as MP3 files. ''Then he might say, 'That's O.K.,' or 'Change that F sharp to a B flat,''' Mr. Higham said.
 Mr. Sondheim's longtime orchestrater, Jonathan Tunick, augmented the orchestra from 27 musicians in the original Broadway production to 78, ''to get the big cinematic sound Tim was after,'' Mr. Higham said.
 Like Mr. Ferretti and Mr. Depp, Mr. Higham noted how economically Mr. Burton conveyed his thoughts. ''He can say three words, and he completely sums up what his vision is,'' he said. ''You get those three words, and you go.'' For ''Sweeney,'' Mr. Higham said, Mr. Burton's words were, ''I want the music almost not to stop.''
 While Mr. Depp and the rest of the cast were finding their way into the music, Mr. Burton was finding his way into the gore. ''He had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost 'Kill Bill' kind of stylization,'' Mr. Zanuck said. ''We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My god, do we dare do this?' '' 
 The results worked, at least according to Mr. Depp. The red liquid latex his razor sent spurting from the necks of Sweeney's victims during the 50-day shoot last winter was, well, thicker than water. ''You see it, you feel it, you hear it,'' he said. ''It wasn't subtle.''

HEADLINE: Writers on the Picket Line Would Feel a Varying Pinch

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES; Andrew Tangel contributed reporting from New York.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
Unions typically consist of people with wallets of similar size. The paychecks of auto workers vary depending on seniority and job title but not so much that some drive BMWs and others rusty old Plymouths.
 The Writers Guild of America, which on Monday plans to start picketing television networks and movie studios in Los Angeles and New York, is starkly different.
 Among the Writers Guild's 12,000 members are television writer-producers like Shonda Rhimes, the creator of ''Grey's Anatomy'' and ''Private Practice,'' who take home up to $5 million a year. On the other extreme are junior writers who -- if they work at all -- make $50,000 or less. About 48 percent of West Coast members are unemployed, according to guild statistics. (No such statistics exist for East Coast members.) 
 The economic disparity within the Writers Guild complicates the union's job as it seeks increases in residual payments for the use of movies and TV shows on DVDs and online, among other issues. Observers say the effectiveness of a strike turns on the union's ability to keep the haves and have-nots tethered, even though both stand to gain -- and lose -- in very different ways from walking a picket line.
 ''This is already a union where there are people who don't have that much in common financially,'' said Daniel H. Black, a lawyer at Greenberg Traurig, a firm with a large television practice. ''If the strike goes more than a month, the guild is going to have a colossal mess in terms of members challenging leadership.''
 The Writers Guild disagrees.
 ''These issues cut across all income levels,'' said Jeff Hermanson, assistant executive director of the West Coast branch, adding, ''I've never seen such unanimity.''
 Sherry Goldman, a spokeswoman for East Coast writers, said, ''If the question is whether there is any difference in resolve between the upper and lower echelons of writers, the answer is an absolute no.''
 Their resolve may not vary, but the impact of a strike on union members will. Residual payments are not crucial to top writers' livelihoods; the bulk of their income comes from up-front fees and studio deals. So some Hollywood veterans see this group as having more to lose, while lower-tier and unemployed writers who use quarterly residual payments to pay the mortgage have the most to gain.
 ''Working writers are used to steady checks and living a certain lifestyle, and that is going to feel a pinch in a hurry,'' said Frank Biondi, the former president and chief executive of Viacom. ''It's less of a big deal for out-of-work writers to picket. Not working is what they're doing already.''
 Under the previous contract, which expired Wednesday night, the six major studios must pay a minimum of $106,000 for an original screenplay, while networks must pay at least $20,956 for a teleplay for a prime-time comedy and $30,823 for a prime-time drama.
 Many working writers earn much more. The writer of a major studio release can expect a paycheck of at least $1 million, according to union members, while ''name'' screenwriters might earn in the $4 million range per picture. The average working writer in Hollywood takes home about $200,000 a year, according to the studios and networks, which are represented by the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
 That is a lot of money compared with the average earnings of people in Los Angeles County and typical Americans. The average worker in Los Angeles County earned $52,572 last year, according to government statistics, while the per capita income of the overall population is about $25,000.
 But everything is relative. Writers compare their paychecks with those of many actors, directors and studio executives and see a need for a major re-alignment. According to the Writers Guild, guild-covered writer earnings have risen at less than half the rate of entertainment industry profits.
 Many writers complain that studios view them as disposable. ''That's how the movers and shakers really feel, and how, for the most part, the writers are treated,'' James A. Owen, a screenwriter, wrote on an industry blog last week. ''There to be used. Powerless. Generally unnecessary.'' 
 Moreover, guild writers at all levels are angry about the increasing use of nonunion labor in Hollywood. In the mid-1980s, according to the guild, about 95 percent of industry writing jobs in both television and feature films were covered by the guild. That share, the guild maintains, has dropped to about 55 percent as entertainment companies use divisions outside the guild to produce an array of animated, reality and other shows.
 As a result, writers at all income levels are feeling pressure.
 ''The majority of writers are barely making a living, and the majority of writers' careers are very short-lived,'' said Chris Albers, a writer for ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien'' and a past president of the East Coast branch of the Writers Guild. ''So we feel that if these companies are going to be making a lot of money off of what we create, and we only have a few years to be in the game, then it's fair to compensate us so that we can support our families.''

HEADLINE: Timing of a Proposed M.T.A. Fare Increase Should Come as No Surprise

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Authority have tried to frame their proposal for higher subway, bus and commuter rail fares as a departure from past increases. They say it should be seen as part of a long-term financial plan, with a fare increase next year to be followed by an increase in state and city subsidies down the road. 
 But if the fare does go up next year, it will share at least one trait with most other fare increases of the last four decades: It will fall into a well-worn spot in the political calendar by coming near the beginning of a governor's term. 
 The transportation authority was created in 1968 as a semi-independent body tied most closely to the governor's office. Since then, subway and bus fares have gone up 12 times, and half of those increases occurred during the first 13 months of a governor's four-year term. 
 Each time a new governor was elected, a fare increase was approved within a year of his taking office. 
 Next month, less than a year after Gov. Eliot Spitzer's inauguration, the authority's board is expected to vote on a proposal that would increase the base subway and bus fare to $2.25, from $2. 
 ''It's pretty Basic Politics 101,'' said Michael McKeon, a political consultant and a former communications director for Gov. George E. Pataki. ''It's better to get the tough stuff out of the way as early as you can.''
 Former Mayor Edward I. Koch, a veteran of several fare battles, said it was not surprising that politicians would want to raise fares early in their term, long before an election year. 
 ''You don't want to have an angry public with an increased fare going to the polls with that as the No. 1 issue,'' he said.
 The authority is holding a series of public hearings on the fares proposal, including two at 6 tonight -- one at the Marriott at the Brooklyn Bridge in Brooklyn, and one at the Palisades Center in West Nyack.
 It has often been said that the authority was created to shield governors and mayors from direct responsibility for poor train service and rising fares. But the fig leaf only covers so much. 
 As Mr. Koch put it, ''No matter that the M.T.A. is an independent agency, everybody believes that both the governor and the mayor have enormous input into what the nominees appointed by them will ultimately do.'' 
 The governor appoints the authority's chairman and five others to the 17-member board. Four members are appointed by the governor on the recommendation of the mayor of New York City and one member each on the recommendations of the Nassau, Suffolk and Westchester county executives. 
 In addition, four board members, who collectively cast a single vote, are picked by the chief executives of Rockland, Orange, Dutchess and Putnam Counties. 
 Mr. Pataki, who arguably exerted more direct control over the authority than any of his predecessors, was governor during three fare increases. The first one, with the subway and bus fare rising to $1.50 from $1.25, occurred in November 1995, during his first year in office. 
 A former Pataki aide who was involved in discussions over that fare increase explained the thinking of the governor's staff.
 ''If you raise the fare early, then you have time for people to see what the benefits are of raising the fare,'' said the former aide, who asked not to be named because the aide still works with state government. ''Where if you raise it late, all people do is get the shock of raising the fare.'' 
 But some officials said politics was not part of the calculation when they pushed for fare hikes. E. Virgil Conway, whom Mr. Pataki appointed as chairman of the authority in 1995, said the fare hike that year was needed to stabilize the authority's finances. 
 Richard Ravitch, who was considered one of the most independent of the authority's chairmen, pointed out that the first time he raised the fare, in June 1980, it broke a promise by Gov. Hugh L. Carey that the fare would not go up. ''I didn't make decisions on the basis of who was running for what, when,'' Mr. Ravitch said in an interview last week.
 Mr. Pataki was re-elected twice, in 1998 and 2002. He spent part of the campaign in 2002 side-stepping charges from his opponent, H. Carl McCall, that another increase was looming. 
 Mr. Pataki won re-election on Nov. 5. Two weeks later, the authority's chairman, Peter S. Kalikow, proposed an increase in the fare. The following May, the fare rose to $2. In 2005, the cost of unlimited-ride MetroCards rose but the base fare remained unchanged.
 The authority, under Mr. Kalikow, ultimately proposed a system of regular, modest fare increases every two years. But a proposed increase slated for 2007 -- an election year -- was canceled, partly because the authority was running a large surplus. The move had the added effect of putting off a decision on the fare until a new governor was sitting in Albany. 
 Elliot G. Sander, the chief executive of the authority, who was appointed by Mr. Spitzer, said that the political calendar did not affect his proposal for a fare increase. 
 ''That has not been a factor for the M.T.A. in preparing its financial plan,'' Mr. Sander said. 
 His proposal also calls for a series of regular, inflation-indexed fare increases every two years, with the first of those proposed for 2010, when Gov. Spitzer would be up for re-election. 
 ''We are proposing to do it twice in the governor's term, and so that does not follow what has occurred historically,'' Mr. Sander said. 
 The authority says it needs more money because its expenditures, including debt payments and employee health care costs, are rising faster than its income. Mr. Sander has described his proposal as a balanced approach because it also calls on the state and city to increase their annual subsidies to the authority's operating budget by a total of about $600 million, beginning in 2010. 
 But a group of State Assembly members have questioned how balanced that approach really is, saying the authority should at the very least ask for additional state funding to begin next year. 
 Richard L. Brodsky, a Democratic assemblyman from Westchester County, said that the current fare debate has deviated from the ritualized script of previous years. In the past, the authority would often threaten to raise the fare as a way to force the state to come up with more funding. While an increase was rarely avoided altogether, the result was often a smaller increase coupled with additional state funding.
 ''What's missing this time isn't the pressure to raise the fare,'' Mr. Brodsky said. ''What's missing is the M.T.A.'s genteel blackmail, saying to the political structures that in the end an affordable fare is a political decision.'' 
 Mr. Brodsky said that politicians and officials at the authority had lost sight of their duty to keep the fare affordable. 
 He added, ''Isn't the fare a last resort? Or is the fare a first resort when a new governor is elected?''

HEADLINE: Group Spotlights Jews Who Left Arab Lands

BYLINE: By WARREN HOGE

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
With assertions of the rights of Palestinians to reclaim land in Israel expected to arise at an planned Middle East peace conference in Annapolis, Md., a Jewish advocacy group has scheduled a meeting in New York on Monday to call attention to people it terms ''forgotten refugees.''
 The organizing group, Justice for Jews from Arab Countries, says it is referring to the more than 850,000 Jews who left their homes in Arab lands after the declaration of the state of Israel in 1948. 
 ''This did not occur by happenstance, as is sometimes said,'' said Stanley A. Urman, executive director of the group, a five-year-old New-York-based organization. ''In fact, we have found evidence that there was collusion among the Arab nations to persecute and exploit their Jewish populations.''
 To back the claim, the group has reproduced copies of a draft law composed by the Arab League in 1947 that called for measures to be taken against Jews living in Arab countries. The proposals range from imprisonment, confiscation of assets and forced induction into Arab armies to beatings, officially incited acts of violence and pogroms.
 Subsequent legislation and discriminatory decrees enacted by Arab governments against Jews were ''strikingly similar'' to the actions laid out in the draft law, Mr. Urman said.
 In January 1948, the World Jewish Congress submitted a memo with the text of the draft to the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It accompanied the submission with a warning that ''all Jews residing in the Near and Middle East face extreme and imminent danger.''
 At a meeting two months later, however, Charles Malik, the Lebanese ambassador and president of the council, succeeded in a parliamentary maneuver that ended consideration of the memo. Though the event drew news coverage at the time, it has apparently gone unnoticed since.
 The Arab League draft law had been drawn up in response to the Nov. 29, 1947, vote in the General Assembly to partition Palestine into two states, one Arab and one Jewish.
 With the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, the status of Jews in Arab countries changed dramatically, because most of those countries either declared war on Israel or supported the war to destroy the new state.
 The group cites United Nations figures showing that 856,000 Jewish residents left Arab countries in 1948.
 ''This was not just a forced exodus, it was a forgotten exodus,'' said Irwin Cotler, a former Canadian minister of justice who is scheduled to be the main speaker at Monday's program to open the campaign on behalf of the Jewish refugees.
 For that reason, he said, the main goal of the campaign was to raise public awareness rather than to seek compensation. ''It's not about the money, it's about the other components of redress, recognition, remembrance and acknowledgment of the wrongs committed,'' he said.
 He said that a particular focus of the campaign would be the United Nations, where Palestinian concerns got regular attention and Israel was frequently the object of condemning resolutions. ''The U.N. has participated in expunging this experience from the Mideast narrative and from the U.N. narrative,'' Mr. Cotler said.
 The campaign is aimed at assuring that mention of Jewish refugees is included in future General Assembly and Human Rights Council resolutions and commemorations.
 The next opportunity would be Nov. 29, the 60th anniversary of the partition vote, which is officially recognized by the United Nations as the International Day of Solidarity With the Palestinian People. 
 The United Nations says that 711,000 Palestinians left Israel-controlled territory in 1948 and 1949 and that today, along with their descendants, the number of Palestinian refugees is at least four million.
 ''There is mention, as there should be, of Palestinian refugees, but no mention of Jewish refugees,'' Mr. Cotler said of the annual commemoration.
 Another objective is to push for early passage of resolutions introduced in the United States Senate and House that say that any explicit reference to Palestinian refugees in any official document must be matched by a similar explicit reference to Jewish and other refugees.
 The American-sponsored peace conference in Annapolis is planned to take place before the end of the year to address core issues of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict like borders, the status of Jerusalem and the Palestinian refugees.
 ''We want to have this meeting now, in advance of the Annapolis conference, to ensure that this issue is front and center in the international awareness as it should be,'' Mr. Urman said.
 Daniel Carmon, an ambassador at the Israeli mission, said that while there ought to be a change in attitude at the United Nations, no one expected it to occur soon.
 ''This has not been forgotten because it does not exist,'' he said. ''It is a reflection of the dynamic at the U.N.'' 
 Mr. Cotler said a change in perception would help bring the region's antagonists together. 
 ''I know this may sound Pollyannaish, but I believe that if we allow people to understand the truth of what occurred, then they will be able to recognize the other,'' he said. ''Right now the other is being demonized.''

HEADLINE: Wobbled by Wealth?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
At just about every stop I've made so far on my book tour, what I've come to think of as The Question comes up. I talk about the origins of the long right-wing dominance of American politics, and the reasons I believe that dominance is coming to an end. Then someone asks, ''How can you be optimistic about the prospects for progressive change, when big money has so much influence on politics?''
 It's a good question. 
 The public wants change. ''If Americans have ever been angrier with the state of the country,'' begins a new strategy memo from the polling organization Democracy Corps, ''we have not witnessed it.'' 
 Nor is the demand for change solely about Iraq: there has been a strong revival of economic populism. Democracy Corps asked those who believe America is on the wrong track to choose phrases that best described their views of what's gone wrong. The most commonly chosen were ''Big businesses get whatever they want in Washington'' and ''Leaders have forgotten the middle class.''
 So much, by the way, for pundits who claim that Americans don't care about economic inequality.
 Longer-term studies of public opinion suggest a substantial leftward shift. James Stimson, a political scientist who uses data from many polls to construct an index of the overall liberalism or conservatism of the electorate, finds that America is now more liberal than it has been since the early 1960s. And the tactics the right has historically used to distract voters from economic issues, above all the exploitation of racial tensions, have been losing their effectiveness.
 But the Democracy Corps memo warns that ''Democrats have not yet found their voice as agents of change.'' Indeed. What the memo doesn't say, but is all too obvious, is that one big reason the Democrats are having trouble finding their voice is the influence of big money.
 The most conspicuous example of this influence right now is the way Senate Democrats are dithering over whether to close the hedge fund tax loophole -- which allows executives at private equity firms and hedge funds to pay a tax rate of only 15 percent on most of their income. 
 Only a handful of very wealthy people benefit from this loophole, while closing the loophole would yield billions of dollars each year in revenue. Retrieving this revenue is a key ingredient in legislation approved by the House Ways and Means Committee to reform the alternative minimum tax, something that must be done to avoid a de facto tax increase for millions of middle-class Americans.
 A handful of superwealthy hedge fund managers versus millions of middle-class Americans -- it sounds like a no-brainer. 
 But as The Financial Times reports, ''Key votes have been delayed and time bought after the investment industry hired some of Washington's most prominent lobbyists to influence lawmakers and spread largesse through campaign donations.'' It goes on to describe how Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, was ''toasted by industry lobbyists'' (and serenaded by Barry Manilow) at a money-raising party for his special fund to help Democrats get elected next year.
 Is this the shape of things to come? My questioners fear that it is. 
 Fears of betrayal are often focused on Hillary Clinton. Some people who raise The Question cite an article in The Nation from last summer, which suggested that Hillary Clinton's commitment to change is suspect. ''Not only is Hillary more reliant on large donations and corporate money than her Democratic rivals,'' warned the article, ''but advisers in her inner circle are closely affiliated with unionbusters, G.O.P. operatives, conservative media and other Democratic Party antagonists.''
 O.K., some perspective. I sometimes hear people say that there's no difference between Democrats and Republicans; that's foolish. Look at the fight over children's health insurance, and you can see how different the parties' philosophies and priorities really are. All of the leading Democratic candidates are offering strongly progressive policy proposals; the Republicans are, if anything, running to the right of the Bush administration.
 Also, even history's greatest progressives had to make compromises to win their victories. F.D.R.'s New Deal depended on the support of Southern segregationists. Compared with that, Senator Clinton's acceptance of lots of corporate donations doesn't look so bad -- though I'd be reassured if she made her views on tax reform clearer, and matched John Edwards's focus on corporate reform.
 Still, I am worried.
 One of the saddest stories I tell in my book is that of Al Smith, the great reformist governor of New York, who gradually turned into a narrow-minded economic conservative and bitter critic of F.D.R. H. L. Mencken explained it thusly: ''His association with the rich has apparently wobbled him and changed him. He has become a golf player.''
 So, how wobbled are today's Democrats? I guess we'll find out.

HEADLINE: Next Hurdle for Ford and U.A.W. Will Be Selling Contract Proposal

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD; Reporting was contributed by Nick Bunkley in Dearborn and Wayne, Mich., and Mary M. Chapman in Dearborn and Detroit.

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
Over the next few weeks, Ford Motor and the United Automobile Workers union each are faced with the challenge of selling their tentative contract as the best they could get in light of Ford's decline.
 Industry analysts said Ford would need to assure Wall Street that it is not backtracking on its revamping plan as it tries to secure the labor peace that eluded General Motors and Chrysler. 
 Meanwhile, the union must win support from Ford's 54,000 members made wary by the job cuts that immediately after the approval of new contracts at the other Detroit auto companies. 
 Hanging over both the company and the union is the likelihood that conditions in the American auto industry will only get worse over the coming year as a result of the housing slump, record oil prices and general economic uncertainty.
 ''People are just feeling stuck with whatever we can get,'' said Clark Griffin, who has worked on the assembly line at Ford's plant in Dearborn, Mich., for seven years. ''If you turn it down, then what's going to happen?''
 The tentative agreement, reached early Saturday, came without a strike. By contrast, G.M. workers walked off the job for two days in late September and Chrysler workers struck for about six hours last month before the union reached new contracts that have since been approved.
 Union leaders at Ford plants around the country are set to meet in Dearborn on Monday afternoon to review the agreement. If they approve it, the contract will go to workers for ratification, a process expected to take about two weeks.
 The Ford contract closely follows the terms of those agreements. Its major feature is a health care trust, called a Voluntary Employee Benefit Association, or VEBA, that will take responsibility for health care benefits for current and future retirees and their families.
 Ford shares rose Friday in anticipation of a deal. But several Wall Street analysts have said the company needs to accelerate its cost-cutting efforts. ''Investors will be very skeptical of any changes'' to Ford's revamping plan, said John A. Casesa, an industry analyst with the Casesa Shapiro Group.
 Ford lost $12.6 billion last year. Analysts expect a third-quarter loss of nearly $1 billion when Ford reports its results on Thursday.
 Under the plan, called the Way Forward, Ford said it would close 16 factories and eliminate 44,000 salaried and hourly jobs by 2012. But it has only named 10 of the 16 plants. At least two of the remaining six apparently were spared under the new contract, which will expire in 2011, local union officials and industry analysts said on Sunday.
 One is Ford's plant in Avon Lake, Ohio, where Ford builds the Econoline van. City officials had said the plant's future rested on the outcome of the talks. 
 ''We're looking forward to a long future for our plant,'' said Tim Donovan, president of U.A.W. Local 2000, which represents workers in Avon Lake. A Ford spokeswoman declined to comment on Sunday.
 But Ford, like G.M. and Chrysler, retained the ability to eliminate shifts and temporarily idle its factories if its sales fall. Its rivals swiftly exercised that option.
 Last week, Chrysler said it was cutting 11,000 hourly and salaried jobs and eliminating shifts at five factories, while G.M. has announced plans to cut three shifts and cut about 3,000 jobs. Both announcements came after workers approved their respective contracts.
 Ford's sales have fallen more than 13 percent this year, because of a planned reduction in unprofitable sales to rental car agencies and a decline in consumer sales.
 Thus its agreement to save some vulnerable plants may not actually protect their workers, said Gary N. Chaison, a professor of industrial relations at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.
 ''The important thing is not whether plants are open or closed,'' he said. ''It's whether or not jobs are maintained, and I don't think Ford's going to give that guarantee.''
 If Ford has obtained significant cost reductions in return for preserving plants, ''I view it as a fair trade,'' Mr. Casesa, the analyst, said. He added, ''It's up to Ford to deliver a strong product plan that will save these plants.''
 Workers agreed that any guarantees of future work hinged on whether Ford could persuade customers to buy its cars.
 ''If you're not selling cars, it's hard to keep plants open,'' said Jim Pappas, an electrician at Ford's assembly plant in Wayne, Mich., the other plant that Ford apparently agreed to spare.
 Added Judy W. Wright, a 29-year company veteran who works in Ford's Dearborn, Mich., engine plant: ''This sacrifice by the workers and by future workers will not save Ford.''

HEADLINE: In Portland, Cultivating a Culture of Two Wheels

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore. 

 BODY:
Susan Peithman did not have a job lined up when she moved here in September to pursue a career in ''nonmotorized transportation.'' No worries, she figured; the market here is strong.
 ''In so many ways, it's the center,'' Ms. Peithman, 26, explained. ''Bike City, U.S.A.''
 Cyclists have long revered Portland for its bicycle-friendly culture and infrastructure, including the network of bike lanes that the city began planning in the early 1970s. Now, riders are helping the city build a cycling economy. 
 There are, of course, huge national companies like Nike and Columbia Sportswear that have headquarters here and sell some cycling-related products, and there are well-known brands like Team Estrogen, which sells cycling clothing for women online from a Portland suburb. 
 Yet in a city often uncomfortable with corporate gloss, what is most distinctive about the emerging cycling industry here is the growing number of smaller businesses, whether bike frame builders or clothing makers, that often extol recycling as much as cycling, sustainability as much as success. 
 Like the local indie rock bands that insist they are apathetic about fame, many of the smaller local companies say craft, not money, is what drives them.
 ''All the frame builders I know got into this because they love bikes,'' said Tony Pereira, a bike builder whose one-man operation has a 10-month waiting list, ''not because they wanted to start a business.''
 Mia Birk, a former city employee who helped lead Portland's efforts to expand cycling in the 1990s, said the original goals were rooted in environmental and public health, not the economy.
 ''That wasn't our driving force,'' Ms. Birk said. ''But it has been a result, and we're comfortable saying it is a positive result.''
 Ms. Birk now helps run a consulting firm, Alta Planning and Design, which advises other cities on how to become more bicycle-friendly. In a report for the City of Portland last year, the firm estimated that 600 to 800 people worked in the cycling industry in some form. A decade earlier, Ms. Birk said in an interview, the number would have been more like 200 and made up almost entirely of employees at retail bike stores.
 Now, Ms. Birk said, the city is nurturing the cycling industry, and there are about 125 bike-related businesses in Portland, including companies that make bike racks, high-end components for racing bikes and aluminum for bikes mass-produced elsewhere. There are small operations that make cycling hats out of recycled fabric. Track, road and cyclo-cross races are held year-round, and state tourism groups promote cycling packages. There is Ms. Birk's firm, which had two employees in Portland in 1999 and now has 14. There are nonprofit advocacy groups and Web sites, including www.bikeportland.org, that are devoted to cycling issues and events in Portland. 
 And then there is the growing, high-end handmade bike industry, which was made up of just one or two businesses a decade ago but now has more than 10. The Portland Development Commission is working with a handful of the bike builders to improve their business and accounting skills and help them network with one another.
 This month, the city will be the host of a trade show featuring bike builders from Oregon, which locals say has more makers than any other state. And early next year, the North American Handmade Bicycle Show will bring its fourth annual event to Portland for the first time. It is expected to be the largest national show so far. 
 Sam Adams, a city commissioner in charge of transportation, joined development officials to help lure the show to Portland. It seemed a natural fit. The city regularly ranks at the top of Bicycling Magazine's list of the best cycling cities and has the nation's highest percentage of workers who commute by bike, about 3.5 percent, according to the Census Bureau. Drivers here are largely respectful of riders, and some businesses give up parking spaces to make way for bike racks.
 ''Our intentions are to be as sustainable a city as possible,'' Mr. Adams said. ''That means socially, that means environmentally and that means economically. The bike is great on all three of those factors. You just can't get a better transportation return on your investment than you get with promoting bicycling.''
 Although the city has worked to help drivers and riders share roadways, two cyclists were killed in October when they were hit by trucks, and questions persist over whether enough is being done to protect cyclists. 
 Mr. Adams said he was preparing a budget proposal that would spend $24 million to add 110 miles to the city's existing 20-mile network of bike boulevards, which are meant to get cyclists away from streets busy with cars. Doing so could ''double or triple ridership,'' he said. 
 The streets were not always so crowded with cyclists. Andy Newlands, by most accounts the first person in Portland to start making bikes by hand, got into the business in the 1970s. Back then, he said, young men would come to him for help piecing together racing bikes. Now, he said, ''More and more it's some guy with a wife and kids and a BMW and all that, and he wants a handmade bike.''
 Thirty years ago Mr. Newlands sold frames for under $300. Now a new bike might cost the buyer well over $5,000. 
 ''There's so much mass-produced stuff out there that there's just kind of a little bit of a backlash,'' he said. ''People like a handmade product.''
 Sacha White, who was a bike messenger before he started Vanilla Bicycles, one of the most prominent bike makers in Portland, said city officials embraced not only cycling but also the niche industry that has grown out of it, something he considered striking given the size of most operations. His company, among the largest of its kind, has six employees including himself. 
 ''I think the biggest thing that's come from the effort the city has put into this is the vote of confidence,'' Mr. White said, speaking of bike riders and bike makers. ''They want us here.''
 Ms. Peithman, the recent Portland arrival, had lived in Chicago until September, where she worked for the Chicagoland Bicycle Federation, a nonprofit advocacy group. She decided to move here on her own without any job prospects based ''90 percent on the bike thing,'' she said. 
 ''I'm a long-term-thinking, spreadsheet kind of girl,'' Ms. Peithman said. ''This is the most rash thing I've ever done.''

HEADLINE: A Winning Soccer Coach Faces a Ruthless Foe

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY WILLIAMS

 BODY:
It is a crisp autumn day and the Martin Luther King Jr. High School soccer team is winning again. Their precision passing and stifling defense usually make for one-sided games; until a few weeks ago, the squad was ranked first in the nation. 
 On the sideline, a bald man with piercing blue eyes is barking instructions, his hoarse voice so weakened by years of shouting that the sound barely makes it across the field to his players, who are as apt to ignore his words as they are to listen.
 ''Forward! Forward! Attack! Shoot!'' he cries out.
 Although the coach said he had a tight bond with his Upper West Side team of mostly immigrant West African, Caribbean and South American teenagers, he acknowledged that there were some things he kept to himself: Primarily that he, Martin Jacobson, age 61, is a former heroin addict who in 1994 learned he had hepatitis C, a potentially fatal and progressive disease. It is now in the third of its four stages. 
 He is not dying, not really, he says, and even if he were, he wouldn't want to know -- or to have his team have to deal with it.
 ''I'm not sure what my life expectancy is right now,'' he said, as his team prepared for this week's city playoffs, in which King is favored to win the championship for the 10th time in 12 years. ''Am I going to die in six months? Am I going to need a liver transplant, which will change every aspect of my life?''
 During his 14-year tenure at King, his teams have won more than 270 games and lost only 14.
 But until he quit drugs and alcohol cold turkey in November 1985, the pursuit of a buzz, not soccer, had been the dominant feature of Mr. Jacobson's life. It is a fact that now embarrasses him.
 While he has discussed some of the details of his life with those close to him, many people, including his colleagues at school and his family, have no idea how serious his addiction had become. 
 He said that now that he is among the best-known youth coaches in New York of any sport -- even turning down offers from soccer parents to coach their children privately -- he hopes his story can help other people. 
 ''I always felt good,'' he said. ''I just wanted to feel better.''
 During a visit to his doctor on Oct. 25 with his longtime companion, Constance Cosner, 59, Mr. Jacobson said he was unsure how much information he wanted. He said he preferred to rely on vitamin supplements and the power of positive thinking.
 ''Part of me doesn't really want to know how many days I have left, or if I'm going to go to Stage 4,'' he told the physician, Dr. Robert Mendelsohn. ''I'm not going back to interferon, I know that,'' he said, referring to a treatment that has helped many hepatitis C patients but has only made him feel more ill. The doctor said Mr. Jacobson was not in any immediate danger of dying or needing a liver transplant, but he wants to do an M.R.I. exam on the liver when the season ends, and a biopsy in the spring. 
 On the soccer field, as Mr. Jacobson claps and exhorts and hugs his players when he substitutes them in and out of games and dramatically covers his face with his hands in response to their mistakes, no one could guess that the coach, known to most as Jake, is sick -- reduced to taking afternoon naps so he can stay awake the rest of the day.
 He is a tightly coiled man, even when he is relaxing or telling a joke. 
 In the past, that intensity has been his undoing: Aside from the heroin addiction, he has been married and divorced three times (a fourth marriage was annulled), been arrested four times, declared bankruptcy twice, fathered six children by five women, and had a bullet graze his head and a drug addict stab him inside a drug den. 
 Now, he takes 32 pills, mostly vitamin supplements, each day, but says he has neither used illegal drugs nor touched alcohol in 22 years.
 ''I feel tired much more than I used to -- sometimes, I think work keeps me alive,'' he said.
 Work means being a dean, guidance counselor, athletic director and boys' and girls' soccer coach on the campus of Martin Luther King Jr. High, which was among the first schools in the city to be split into smaller schools because of years of low test scores and violence, including the 2002 shooting of two students on campus.
 The campus continues to have discipline problems, but Mr. Jacobson has an advantage when dealing with troubled students; he was himself a problem child growing up in Long Beach, on Long Island, during the 1950s. 
 As a 10-year-old, he was caught by a police officer throwing a rock at a car. But instead of taking him to the police station, the officer brought him to a local recreation center, where he began his lifelong affair with soccer. As much as he loved the sport, he didn't lose his taste for trouble -- he stole a car at 16, got into gang fights, sold marijuana.
 After college at Ball State University in Indiana, where he became a star soccer player, he earned a master's degree in guidance and counseling, but had a hard time staying in one place. 
 One time, he quit a teaching job in New York, packed his and his wife's possessions into a Volkswagen bus and drove west, living what he describes as the life of a hippie.
 Another time, he left a job in Detroit, and with his wife, their 3-year-old daughter and a German shepherd named Che drove to the Rocky Mountains and lived in a tent near Aspen, Colo., for a month.
 LSD provided much of the incentive for the adventure. ''I took acid every day,'' he said, enough ''to kill an elephant.'' The trip was even largely financed by LSD, which he had sold in large quantities to assembly line workers at a Ford Motor plant in Detroit.
 ''I don't see how any cars came out right,'' he said.
 After he took a job at Santa Fe High School in New Mexico, he said, his drug use accelerated. He was regularly smoking marijuana, snorting cocaine, dropping acid, taking peyote and quaaludes, and even taking opium anally, because the high was more intense that way.
 ''He was more interested in getting high than anything else,'' said Janet Coffee, his wife at the time. ''He could never get enough.'' 
 Still, he managed to be promoted to director of guidance and to start boys' and girls' varsity soccer programs.
 His drug use, however, eventually doomed his marriage. ''She was in love with me,'' he said of Ms. Coffee, ''and I was in love with drugs.''
 In 1981, on his 35th birthday, a girlfriend gave him a present: an injection of Dilaudid, a drug similar to morphine. Within a week, he was hooked. 
 But when his supply ran out, he switched to black tar heroin, the closest thing to Dilaudid he could find on the streets.
 Before long, Mr. Jacobson said, he had exhausted his savings and retirement accounts and refinanced his car loan, and he gradually began dismantling his house for quick cash, selling the custom-made pine cabinets and the kitchen sink. When the electricity was shut off, he and his daughter Lara, of whom he had custody, used candles.
 ''At lunchtime, I am going down to the projects and scoring dope and shooting up in the school bathroom,'' he said.
 He wrote bad checks, forged others and shoplifted and returned the same items for cash, among his other hustles. Stints in rehab invariably failed.
 Lara, now 36, was spending much of her time alone or hanging out with older children. By the age of 13, she had boyfriends as old as 18, and had begun experimenting with drugs. 
 ''I remember waiting for my dad to come home every night, imagining terrible things happening to him,'' she said recently.
 And though Mr. Jacobson had taken to sleeping with a .45-caliber revolver under his pillow, he said he had never committed a violent crime to finance his drug use.
 Then one day in the early 1980s, Mr. Jacobson said, he and a junkie friend named Geronimo robbed a pharmacy. While Geronimo went inside with a gun, Mr. Jacobson waited in the car -- a brown Subaru station wagon.
 Mr. Jacobson said he does not know what happened inside the pharmacy, but when Geronimo came out, he had large quantities of pharmaceutical cocaine, codeine, Percodan, Percocet and other drugs. 
 ''We put a mattress against the door and shot drugs for three days,'' he said. ''We were ready to shoot it out with the cops.''
 He was not caught for that crime, but he was eventually arrested for writing bad checks. He was threatened with a long prison term, which he avoided, in part, by becoming a paid informant. The school forced him to resign. Unemployed, he bought heroin with the money the Santa Fe police had given him. 
 ''I was a junkie, I looked like a junkie, I acted like a junkie,'' he said. ''This wasn't supposed to happen to me. I was a Jewish kid from a middle-class background on Long Island. It's unheard of.''
 After another arrest, in 1985, for bouncing checks, Mr. Jacobson was ordered out of Santa Rosa, N.M., the small town where he and Lara had moved a few months earlier. They flew to New York. He said he went cold turkey on the flight.
 Then, in 1986, after he managed to get a teaching job in East Harlem, two New York City detectives arrested him at the school for an outstanding warrant in New Mexico. He was led out in handcuffs and told that he faced a 30-year prison sentence for forgery and fraud.
 He was able to resolve the charges with no jail time, and two years later, he took a job at King High School. In 1994, he took over the boys' soccer team and embarked on a streak of unprecedented success. But his tenure has been marked by controversy, including accusations of illegal recruiting from rival coaches. Mr. Jacobson was suspended from coaching for a time several years ago, but he was found to be guilty of only poor record keeping, not cheating. 
 Some of the players who join his team are from Senegal, Mali and Haiti, and they sometimes arrive illegally and without a place to live. He has helped several get housing in city group homes and has been able to help a few get green cards.
 He has transformed King into a soccer powerhouse, even though the school has no field. The team practices on the school gym's basketball courts, and occasionally, the coach and players hop fences to use locked fields. 
 And although some of his players arrive without speaking English, he said about 75 percent of them graduate within four years, higher than the city average of 50 to 60 percent. Several players have received college scholarships and several play in professional leagues around the world.
 ''He has this nurturing in him,'' said Mansour Ndiaye, 27, one of Mr. Jacobson's former players, who went on to play on a national championship team at the University of Connecticut and who is studying for his doctorate in sports management. ''For a lot of immigrants at M.L.K., without that transition with him, it would have been very tough.''
 For now, Mr. Jacobson continues to troll the sidelines, obsessing about not only winning, but playing flawlessly.
 He resists the idea that winning has become a replacement addiction for him, though he acknowledges there are similarities.
 ''When I shot heroin, I got a euphoric feeling,'' he said. ''And when I win a city championship, I get a euphoric feeling. But now, I wake up the next morning feeling a little better.''
 He paused for a moment and added: ''The byproduct is different in that I'm helping kids. In addiction, there is no benefit. As a coach, even in losing, I'm still helping kids.''

HEADLINE: Shiite Ex-Officials Face Trial In Hundreds of Sunni Deaths

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON and ALISSA J. RUBIN; Michael R. Gordon reported from Washington, and Alissa J. Rubin from Baghdad. Mudhafer al-Husaini and Ahmad Fadam contributed reporting from Baghdad.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
An Iraqi judge has ruled that there is enough evidence to try two former Health Ministry officials, both Shiites, in the killing and kidnapping of hundreds of Sunnis, many of them snatched from hospitals by militias, according to American officials who are advising the Iraqi judicial system. 
 The case, which was referred last week to a three-man tribunal in Baghdad, is the first in which an Iraqi magistrate has recommended that such high-ranking Shiites be tried for sectarian violence. But any trial could still be derailed by the Health Ministry, making the case an important test of the government's will to administer justice on a nonsectarian basis. 
 The Iraqi investigation has confirmed long-standing Sunni fears that hospitals had been opened up as a hunting ground for Shiite militias intent on spreading fear among Sunnis and driving them out of the capital. Even before the case, Baghdad residents told of death threats against doctors who would treat Sunnis, of intravenous lines ripped from patients' arms as they were carried away, and of relatives of hospitalized Sunnis who were killed when they came to visit. 
 The case centers on Hakim al-Zamili, a former deputy health minister, and Brig. Gen. Hamid al-Shammari, who led the agency's security force, which is charged with protecting the ministry and its hospitals. The former officials were taken into custody in February and March amid reports that they had been implicated in sectarian violence and corruption. But the status of the judicial inquiry into their activities and its findings have not previously been reported.
 The inquiry included testimony from nine witnesses, some of whom have been granted visas to live in the United States for their protection. 
 If the trial goes ahead, it would be held in a new Rule of Law complex in the Rusafa section of the capital. The installation was built by the American military this year and the government has allocated $49 million to operate it. Judges live at the heavily fortified compound to protect them from assassins and renegade militias. The proceedings, which could happen in the next few weeks, would be videotaped and, according to Iraqi law, open to the public. 
 But one looming question is whether the Iraqi government will move forward with the trial, which would shine a light on some of the most serious sectarian abuses committed under government cover. The Health Ministry could try to block the case by invoking a section of the Iraqi criminal law that precludes prosecution of officials who are carrying out their official duties. The Interior Ministry has used this tactic to preclude investigation of a senior National Police officer accused of sectarian crimes. 
 The Iraqi judges slated to try the case have informed the Health Ministry that they want to proceed and have asked for the agency's approval. The Health Ministry has yet to respond. 
 The case, which involves officials allied with the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr and his Mahdi Army militia, would have been difficult for the Iraqi government to take on in the past because Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki received crucial support from Sadr supporters in Parliament. 
 Since the spring, however, when Sadr ministers withdrew from the government, Mr. Maliki has distanced himself from Mr. Sadr's supporters, and he has allied himself with a rival Shiite group, the Supreme Islamic Iraqi Council. 
 ''This investigation and trial can be a real statement that protected Iraqi witnesses and judges will follow the evidence where it leads, even when it leads to corrupt senior government officials,'' Col. Mark S. Martins, the staff judge advocate for the command led by General David H. Petraeus, said in a telephone interview.
 Hospitals were one of the first places where Mr. Sadr's supporters asserted themselves after the ouster of Saddam Hussein. The focus on hospitals was in keeping with Mr. Sadr's efforts to model his movement on Hezbollah, which prides itself on providing medical and aid services. As early as mid-2004, the halls of the ministry were plastered with posters of Mr. Sadr and his father, Muhammad Sadiq al-Sadr.
 At about the same time, large numbers of unemployed Iraqis joined the Facilities Protection Service, which was essentially a low-paying jobs program whose employees were given guns and told to guard government agencies, offices and schools. Many who took the jobs were Shiite supporters of Mr. Sadr.
 With those two organizations in their camp, Sadr supporters were well positioned to wield power when the country factionalized along Sunni-Shiite lines.
 Mr. Zamili and General Shammari were appointed to their positions at the Health Ministry with Mr. Sadr's backing. According to accounts by witnesses interviewed for the Iraqi inquiry, they turned the ministry into a personal fief and gained control of the fuel and vehicles, and its Facilities Protection Service. 
 Accounts from witnesses and evidence gathered for the case point to an array of potential charges. 
 Under Mr. Zamili and General Shammari's direction, about 150 members of the agency's protection service were organized into a company that acted like a private militia. Using Health Ministry identification to move freely around Baghdad and ambulances to ferry weapons, they carried out hundreds of sectarian killings and kidnappings from 2005 to early 2007, the investigation reports.
 It found that Sunni patients at three major Baghdad hospitals -- Al Yarmouk, Ibn al-Nafees and Al Nur -- were abducted and many were killed, as were their relatives who came to visit them. Sunnis who went to hospital morgues to recover the bodies of their relatives were also killed, the investigation found. 
 At the Health Ministry, the investigation found, Sunni doctors who refused Mahdi Army demands that they quit working for the agency were also killed. The head of the Diyala Province hospital, Dr. Ali al-Madawi, a Sunni, was summoned to the Health Ministry in Baghdad, disappeared and is presumed dead.
 At times, the Health Ministry headquarters itself was used to hold kidnap victims. To cover up many of the killings, morgue officials were ordered to draft phony death certifications, the Iraqi inquiry noted. 
 Mr. Zamili's activities, including alleged efforts to divert ministry funds to himself and the Mahdi Army, did not go without challenge. But several ministry officials who stood up to him were kidnapped and killed, the investigation found. Those who were murdered include Mr. Zamili's own personal assistant. A deputy health minister, Ammar al-Saffar, vanished after telling close associates that he had been threatened by Mr. Zamili. The inspector general of the Health Ministry was also threatened in order to discourage an internal investigation, the inquiry found.
 Members of the security force, in a reflection of their religious beliefs, were adamant that autopsies should not be conducted on Mahdi Army fighters and threatened to kill morgue personnel who carried them out, the investigation reported. 
 Michael Walther, an American Justice Department official who is leading a task force that is advising the Iraqis on how to investigate crimes and conduct trails, said the trial could help ease sectarian differences. ''There is a perception among the Sunni population that the court is nothing more than an instrument for the tyranny of the majority,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''This would demonstrate that the court can be a balancing factor.''
 Sunnis have long complained that Baghdad's hospitals were under control of Shiite militias and have sought to avoid them when possible. According to accounts from patients' families and doctors, when Sunnis went to hospitals their identification cards were checked to determine if they had Sunni names. 
 In some cases, Sunnis would be treated on admittance, but at night would be dragged from their beds and their intravenous lines ripped out. Often, their bodies would be found days later. 
 To avoid going to hospitals, some Sunni groups have established their own clinics. ''We have begun establishing small health centers inside some of the houses in Sunni areas,'' said Omar al-Jubori, who heads the Human Rights Committee for the Iraqi Islamic Party. 
 A surgeon at Khadimiya General hospital, which is in a Shiite area, but on the west side of the Tigris River, where many Sunnis live, said in an interview that the doctors there had been given strict instructions from the Mahdi militia not to treat any Sunnis who came to the hospital. 
 ''If they were going to die, we were told to let them die,'' he said. ''If they were going to live, they took care of it. They executed them. The nurses, the cleaners, the workers, were all Mahdi Army or sympathetic to the Mahdi, and they would report you if you tried to do something to help the Sunni patients.'' He refused to be quoted by name for fear that he would be killed.
 One case at the hospital involved a Sunni shopkeeper who was shot in the thigh by several gunmen on motorcycles. He was taken to the hospital by a Shiite neighbor, who was initially told that the victim's injuries were not serious, according to Hassan, an Iraqi who was involved in the episode. But in the morning the neighbor was informed that the Sunni man had died overnight. The neighbors later heard that the Mahdi Army had gone to the hospital and hanged the shopkeeper by the cord that was used to give him intravenous fluids.

HEADLINE: Putting an End to Abusive Lending

 BODY:
When members of the House Financial Services Committee meet this week to put the finishing touches on a bill to curb abusive mortgage lending, they need focus only on how to make a good bill better. 
 The bill's critics -- mainly the finance industry that profited immensely during the mortgage bubble -- claim that new rules could sharply curtail lending. But the current credit squeeze was brought on by reckless lending. Obviously, an absence of rules is a much greater threat to the stable flow of credit than is sound regulation. 
 The unassailable premise of the bill -- the Mortgage Reform and Antipredatory Lending Act of 2007 -- is that lending standards and consumer protections have proved disastrously lax as mortgage making has gone from a local business to a faceless global market for mortgage-related investments. 
 Its approach to establishing standards and protections is levelheaded and evenhanded. The bill requires those giving out loans to first document that borrowers have a reasonable ability to repay, not just during a lower-rate introductory period but also after rates rise. It would eliminate perverse incentives that reward mortgage brokers for putting borrowers into the costliest loans possible. And it requires mortgage brokers to be licensed and registered, putting them more on a par with stockbrokers and insurance brokers. 
 The bill also requires a refinancing to be in the borrower's best long-term economic interest. Some of the worst abuses have occurred when homeowners have been persuaded to cash in their home equity and refinance with complex adjustable-rate loans that are virtually impossible to pay off over time. 
 And very important, the bill does not bar states from enforcing their own, sometimes stronger consumer protections. Bankers would prefer a federal law that pre-empted state law, but consumers would be disadvantaged if a new law undercut the states.
 Where the bill needs beefing up is in ensuring that borrowers can get relief from loans that violate the law. As drafted, it allows wronged borrowers to seek some redress from the original lender, even if they're not in danger of losing their homes. However, borrowers whose abusive loans have been sold to investors cannot sue those investors for relief until they're facing foreclosure. 
 Wall Street would like to keep it that way. But forcing borrowers into foreclosure as a condition for asserting their rights would be unfair. Besides, there are already protections for Wall Street in the bill. It does not allow class-action suits and has other liability caps. 
 The committee and its chairman, Barney Frank, deserve high praise for thorough and thoughtful work on this bill. America's homeowners need its protections.

HEADLINE: PetroChina May Become Top Company

BYLINE: By DONALD GREENLEES and DAVID LAGUE

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
When the government-owned oil and gas giant PetroChina makes its debut Monday on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, China's booming stock markets will be on the verge of setting another milestone. Soon after the Shanghai listing, some analysts expect PetroChina to surpass Exxon Mobil as the world's largest company by market capitalization. 
 PetroChina shares, already traded in New York and Hong Kong, are expected to be seized on by a market awash with cash and investors eager for new opportunities. 
 At the close of trading Friday, PetroChina was valued at $460 billion, making it the world's second-most-valuable company, worth about $26 billion less than Exxon Mobil.
 The ebullience with which Chinese investors have embraced the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets has made China home to some of the world's most expensive companies. It has the biggest bank, insurance company and airline by market capitalization. Five of the world's 10 largest companies are here. 
 However, the prices set on the Chinese exchanges are still largely isolated from the rest of the world by regulatory barriers that limit the amount of foreign money entering the markets and domestic money permitted to leave. As a result, equities here bear little relation to company performance or potential.
 For example, PetroChina's share price may double after its debut in Shanghai, permitting the company to overtake Exxon Mobil, but PetroChina is about half as profitable as its rival. In the first half of 2007, PetroChina's profit was $10.9 billion, compared with $19.5 billion for Exxon Mobil.
 Moreover, weighed down by government-imposed price caps on gasoline, PetroChina's refinery business is losing tens of millions of dollars a day, petroleum analysts say, even after China raised gas price caps last month.
 ''They are very strong in China, and that is good if you make money,'' said John Vautrain, senior vice president of the energy economics consultancy Purvin & Gertz in Singapore, ''but China is not a good place to be a refiner at the moment. They are deeply under water, losing a lot of money in refining.'' 
 Some analysts say PetroChina's debut may be less a cause for celebration than a caution about the Chinese market bubble. 
 ''It could continue for a while longer yet,'' said Warren Blight, a market analyst with Fox-Pitt Kelton in Hong Kong. But ''everyone agrees that at some point the stock market bubble will burst. The issue is when that will happen and what will cause it.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Official Calls Russian Radar Good, But Not Exact Enough for Tracking Plan

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 

 BODY:
To block American proposals for building missile defenses in Europe, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia surprised the White House in June with a counteroffer to let the United States use one of the Kremlin's most secret early-warning radars.
 That Russian radar, in Azerbaijan, a neighbor of Iran, has since been a central focus of negotiations between Washington and Moscow. But much about it had remained mysterious. 
 Now, the first American military officer to visit the Russian radar said Friday that he came away with three significant impressions. The radar is huge, almost twice the size of a similar American system. Despite its reliance on outdated vacuum-tube technology, the system is extremely able as an early-warning radar scanning the skies over the Middle East.
 But the officer, Maj. Gen. Patrick O'Reilly, deputy director of the Pentagon's Missile Defense Agency, also said that the Russian early warning system would not be an adequate replacement for the American radar proposed for the Czech Republic, which is designed for very precise tracking and focusing on targets.
 After Mr. Putin's offer this summer of access to the radar, General O'Reilly led a six-member team to the site in Azerbaijan in mid-September, the first time American military officers had been allowed inside one of Russia's most secret installations.
 Despite the system's older technology, ''I was impressed by what I saw,'' General O'Reilly said. ''It would be a false impression to dismiss the capabilities they have. They just chose another way of achieving it. It is an excellent radar for the case of early warning.''
 The radar has been well maintained and upgraded since its design in the 1970s and construction in the 1980s, prompting General O'Reilly to report back to Washington that the Russian system offers an extremely desirable ability for early warning of a ballistic missile attack from a country like Iran.
 That analysis prompted the United States to invite Russia to link the radar to an American and NATO missile-defense system in Europe, which would include a radar system in the Czech Republic and 10 missile interceptors in Poland.
 But General O'Reilly stressed that the Russian radar was not designed to perform the same function as the American radar proposed for the Czech Republic. The American radar is intended to track specific targets and then precisely guide an interceptor to destroy a warhead, something the Russian radar cannot do, since it was designed to scan larger areas but with less detail, he said.
 Congress is poised to cut $85 million from the proposed budget for the European missile defense system until Poland and the Czech Republic agree to accommodate the sites. Bush administration officials had hoped for agreements by the end of this year, but now they are not expected before 2008. The agreements must be approved by the Polish and Czech Parliaments.
 In his first interview since inspecting the Russian radar in Azerbaijan, General O'Reilly said he was surprised by the sheer size of the system, which filled two buildings -- one 17 stories high and one 8 stories.
 Russian military technology is known for designs that are super-size, an outgrowth of Soviet strategy in which a centrally planned economy could push huge sums of rubles to the military to counter American technological superiority.
 While American military technology adopted solid-state semiconductor electronics decades ago, the Russian radar still operates using vacuum tubes, General O'Reilly said.
 He noted that Russia had improved tube technology far beyond where the United States had taken it before moving to electrical semiconductors.
 After the American visit, two Russian colonels joined General O'Reilly and his boss, Lt. Gen. Henry A. Obering III, the missile agency director, at their Washington headquarters to view operations of an American missile defense test over the Pacific Ocean on Sept. 28. That also was a first for the two militaries.
 In an effort to overcome the Kremlin's objections to the American missile-defense plan for Europe, Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates traveled to Moscow last month to invite Russia to join the United States and NATO as a full partner in designing and operating an antimissile system guarding all of Europe.
 Mr. Gates said that while the United States hoped to proceed with building the two missile defense sites in Europe, it might delay activation of the system until there was ''definitive proof'' that Iran posed a missile threat to Europe. He defined such proof as the test flight of an Iranian missile with enough range to strike the continent.
 ''The whole premise of the suggestion that I made in Moscow of when you operationalize this would be tied to seeing a flight test,'' Mr. Gates said at the Pentagon on Thursday. ''It's a pretty straightforward threshold. And our belief is we will see those flight tests considerably sooner than the Russians seem to think we will see those flight tests.''

The Higher Value of Eyeballs
 Underscoring all the debates about online privacy, behavioral targeting and Internet advertising is a hard, cold reality: content costs money.
 Media companies, at some point soon, have to figure out how to recoup their content production costs through online advertising. The problem is not that people are spending more time online than with physical newspapers or magazines. The real problem is that the giant pie of audience has been split into smaller and smaller pieces as more television channels and niche publications compete for attention. The media industry calls it fragmentation, but in simple terms, it means smaller audiences for publications and television programs that used to be watched by large chunks of society.
 As mass advertising dies, there is more pressure for media companies to develop audiences with more specific interests and characteristics. From an economic standpoint, the drop in the total number of eyeballs means the eyeballs that remain must become more lucrative. 
 Media companies are also using targeting, often called behavioral targeting, to provide more valuable eyeballs. Behavioral targeting tracks the sites people visit to deliver them more relevant ads later on. LOUISE STORY
 Squeezing Taxes
 From the V.C.'s
 The nation's venture capitalists might need to invest in some group therapy, or appointments at the spa, and certainly accountants.
 This group of technology investors is all steamed up over the prospect of paying significantly higher taxes.
 The House Ways and Means Committee voted last week to change the tax rate for venture capitalists when the companies they have invested in are sold for a profit. The returns, called ''carried interest,'' are now taxed at a capital gains rate of around 15 percent.
 Under the proposal approved by the House committee, carried interest would rise to the rate of ordinary income, typically about 35 percent for venture capitalists.
 Venture capitalists lobbied hard against the change. They argued that they did not deserve to be lumped in with other private equity investors, like hedge funds. The venture capitalists argued that they deserved separate treatment because they risk their time and capital to build new companies, and, in turn, jobs.
 Thus far, they are not getting separate treatment.
 Mark G. Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association, said in a statement that the innovation and creation of start-up companies would be hindered by the greater tax rate. Venture capitalists, he said, might put their capital somewhere else, where Uncle Sam would get a smaller bite.
 Advocates of change have balked at that argument. They say the venture capitalists are still poised to make handsome sums if their investments prove successful. Further, advocates for change say, there is no simple way to write a law that affects the venture capitalists but not other private equity investors.

 Facebook Stock
 Rises and Rises 
 The phrase ''pre-I.P.O. shares'' is a powerful recruiting magnet in Silicon Valley, where dreams of striking it rich on the back of stock options have motivated many a start-up's employees to work around the clock. If the shares come from a hot company, say Facebook, the proposition can prove as irresistible as a lottery ticket with short odds.
 Of course, not all pre-I.P.O. shares are created equal. Facebook's new eye-popping $15 billion valuation is certain to make the price of stock options available to future employees go up, presenting a recruiting challenge. How much they will go up is impossible to know without knowing the details of Microsoft's $240 million investment in Facebook. And Microsoft's investment is likely to be for preferred stock, while employee options are typically for common shares, usually priced lower than preferred shares.
 Facebook's shares have already gone up significantly since the company's early days. According to filings with the California Department of Corporations, Facebook's common shares were priced at 78 cents in January 2006. By May of that year, they had risen to $8.05. In August of this year, they were $6.61. Incorporation filings in Delaware show that FaceBook split its shares four for one in July 2006, so on a split-adjusted basis the shares had been worth 19.5 cents in January 2006, before the split. That means Facebook's sense of its own worth has risen a factor of almost 33 times in less than two years.
 Facebook hasn't filed the price of its common shares after the Microsoft investment. But on Oct. 18, it filed with the State of Delaware to split its stock four for one again. MIGUEL HELFT
 Still Awaiting
 Amazon's Kindle
 Amazon promised it would deliver its keyboard-equipped electronic book reader, the Kindle, during the second week of October, publishing industry executives say. Now, those same people say that the company has pushed back that date and is aiming for an introduction by the end of this year. 
 Take that with a grain of salt. Amazon.com and its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, are notoriously persnickety. For example, they delayed their digital music service for two years, trying to find the most appealing way to sell music, before introducing the Amazon MP3 store last month, free of digital rights management software.
 Amazon's introduction of the Kindle, and its associated e-book hub on Amazon.com, has followed the same path. Word of the device first leaked more than a year ago on the technology site Engadget.com. Since then, Sony has introduced two well-received versions of its Reader, while Amazon has toiled silently on the Kindle. Still, e-books have yet to capture the public imagination and represent only a fraction of the $35-billion-a-year book business.
 Publishing executives say Amazon is trying to work out technology kinks in the Kindle and bring as many titles -- books, magazines and newspapers -- onto the service as possible before introduction. BRAD STONE

HEADLINE: Missteps on Both Sides Prevented Compromise on Children's Bill

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
They met almost every day in the spring and summer, a handful of powerful senators who had cleared their schedules to forge a bipartisan compromise providing health insurance to 10 million children.
 It was a remarkable commitment of time for the senators, who sequestered themselves for two hours a day in the office of Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat whose conference room is decorated with an Old West motif and filled with small sculptures of cowboys and buffaloes.
 But even before they finished their work, President Bush attacked it.
 In a pre-emptive strike on June 27, Mr. Bush -- standing before another Western image, an equestrian portrait of Theodore Roosevelt as a Rough Rider -- said the proposal would ''cause huge increases in government spending'' and lead to ''government-run health care for every American.'' 
 Senators were taken aback by what they saw as the ferocity of the president's comments. Telephone logs and e-mail messages show that Republican senators and their aides had frequently consulted White House officials as the bill took shape.
 One participant in the talks, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, called the criticism and veto threats premature, ''disappointing, even a little unbelievable.''
 The testy exchange illustrated the misconceptions and frustrations on both sides as Congress and the White House lurched down the path that led to Mr. Bush's veto of a bill that had bipartisan support. 
 For now, Mr. Bush has won the fight by rejecting a bill that he says would have vastly expanded the federal role in health care and covered some children whose families could afford private insurance. But Democrats say they have won because, in elections next year, they can portray Republicans as having neglected the needs of low-income children while pouring hundreds of billions of dollars into the Iraq war. 
 Missteps by each side made compromise impossible. Democrats say that Mr. Bush described the bill in wildly inaccurate terms, got bad advice from his staff and missed many opportunities to find common ground. Republicans say that Democrats misjudged the president; excluded House Republicans, who in the end were crucial, from negotiations; and aimed negative advertisements at the very members whose votes they needed to override a veto. 
 The bill symbolizes the inability of Mr. Bush and the new Democratic leaders of Congress to work together, but it also highlights the rift between Mr. Bush and members of his own party, including many who helped create the child health program 10 years ago.
 Supporters of the bill have revised it, in an effort to address Republican concerns and pick up more Republican votes. But their efforts to satisfy the president have proved futile. They find themselves where they were in June, facing another veto.
 The Senate on Thursday passed the revised version of the legislation, clearing the bill for the president, who said Congress was wasting time. 
 In the last four months the bill has changed substantially, but the criticism has not, and this frustrates lawmakers like Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, who said the president had been ''given some pretty bad advice'' by his staff.
 Staff members who shaped the White House strategy include Allan B. Hubbard, director of the National Economic Council; Keith B. Hennessey, a former policy director for Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi; and Julie L. Goon, a special assistant to the president.
 In an interview, Mr. Hubbard said his work on the bill had been extremely frustrating.
 ''I was told last January or February by Democrats that their game plan was to send the president a bill that was too big to swallow, and it would be a beautiful political issue for them,'' Mr. Hubbard said.
 From the start, said Michael O. Leavitt, the secretary of health and human services, administration officials viewed the debate in ideological terms, as ''a center court match'' pitting supporters of government-run health care against proponents of private health care markets.
 Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, said White House officials ''have never been helpful in the entire process.'' 
 Representative Michael R. Turner, an Ohio Republican who voted for the bill, said, ''The administration did not come forward with any real offer of a solution or a compromise that would break the logjam.'' And the Democrats, Mr. Turner said, often seemed more interested in politics than in policy.
 In June and early July, Mr. Bush denounced the legislation taking shape in Congress. This infuriated senators of both parties, who were still drafting the bill. 
 While the small group of senators was hashing out details of their bipartisan proposal, White House officials urged lawmakers to provide tax breaks for anyone buying private health insurance. Mr. Hubbard, a business school classmate of Mr. Bush's, kept promoting this idea even after Senate Republican leaders told the White House the time was not ripe for this broader debate.
 Senator Hatch tried to bring White House officials into the negotiations, believing their involvement would produce a better bill. But, lawmakers said, the administration did not want to discuss the child health program except as part of a broader discussion that included the president's tax proposals.
 In early June, the White House sent a message to Republicans saying the president hoped they would not cut a deal with Democrats. The White House predicted that Republicans would have more ''negotiating leverage'' in the fall. That appears to have been a miscalculation.
 ''I have zero impact on what the Democrats do,'' Mr. Leavitt said last week. 
 By contrast, Mr. Grassley and Mr. Hatch maximized their influence by working with Democrats behind the scenes. They held the cost of the bill far below what Democrats originally wanted.
 For their part, Democrats misjudged the president. When the Senate Finance Committee approved the child health bill in July by a vote of 17 to 4, Mr. Rockefeller said, ''It's not clear to me that the president has any intention of vetoing this,'' because the political consequences could be disastrous.
 Explaining why he vetoed it, Mr. Bush said ''we weren't dialed in'' to the negotiations. But after checking their calendars, lawmakers said they and their aides had had more than 35 meetings and telephone conversations on the issue with Mr. Hubbard, Mr. Hennessey and Ms. Goon from January through September.
 While Senate Republicans were deeply involved in writing the bill, House Republicans said they had been shut out.
 On Oct. 25, just hours before the House took up the revised version of the child health bill, Democratic leaders met with several dozen House Republicans to seek their votes for the measure, which had just been introduced the day before.
 ''The Democrats were simply telling us what was in the bill,'' said Representative Thelma Drake, Republican of Virginia. ''There was no dialogue.'' 
 Mrs. Drake added that ''the Democrats refused to delay the vote because they had already purchased ads to be used against us in our districts.'' Some of those have been directed against the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who is up for re-election next year. 
 ''It's hard to negotiate with somebody when they are shooting at you,'' said Don Stewart, a spokesman for Mr. McConnell.

HEADLINE: Gates in Beijing for Talks on Military Buildup

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 4 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates arrived Sunday in Beijing to begin two days of talks with senior leaders, and Pentagon officials said he planned to press for a more open dialogue on China's military while discussing ways to build trust and cooperation.
 ''I don't consider China at this point a military threat to the United States,'' Mr. Gates said before he left for China. 
 ''I have concerns with a variety of military programs that they have under way,'' he added. ''I have concern with the lack of transparency. And those are the kinds of issues that we will be talking about, in addition to how we can strengthen the relationship.''
 Senior Defense Department officials say China has undertaken an aggressive military modernization campaign that will result in more submarines, surface warships and combat aircraft able to challenge foreign armed forces across the region.
 But the Chinese military operates in ways that are far more opaque than Western armed forces, Pentagon officials say, leaving the United States uncertain about the exact size of China's military budget or its long-range military goals.
 ''What does the military buildup mean for us and the rest of the region?'' a senior Defense Department official said, speaking anonymously because he was commenting in advance on high-level meetings, as he described issues Mr. Gates planned to discuss with his hosts.
 According to Pentagon statistics, the official Chinese military budget grew by almost 18 percent this year. But Pentagon officials say that figure does not represent the nation's entire spending on national security.
 While the Bush administration has welcomed a prosperous and peaceful China, American officials regularly encourage it to take on more responsibility for maintaining stability in a global system that has rewarded Chinese economic interests.
 Thus, looking beyond the Pacific Rim, Mr. Gates is expected to press Beijing to contribute further to economic sanctions intended to halt Iran's nuclear ambitions, which could be a prickly issue given China's growing economic ties with Iran.
 ''We think China could do more on Iran,'' said the senior Pentagon official traveling with the defense secretary.
 Mr. Gates, making his first visit to China as defense secretary, succeeded Donald H. Rumsfeld, who issued a number of provocative statements on the Chinese military before leaving office last December. Ties between the Chinese and American military had already improved since a crisis after a 2001 collision of a Chinese fighter jet with an American reconnaissance aircraft.
 Other issues expected to be raised in the sessions in Beijing include stalled plans for a military-to-military telephone link between the two nations, as well as China's recent test of an antisatellite weapon. The test greatly concerned the American military, given its reliance on satellites for communications, finding targets and global positioning.
 ''If you are sitting in the Pentagon, China is a potential peer competitor,'' said Michael J. Green, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington policy institute.
 ''You want to shape Chinese decisions, to dissuade China from choosing military or other destabilizing solutions to their problems and to encourage them to be a responsible stakeholder,'' said Mr. Green, senior director for Asian affairs on the National Security Council in 2004 and 2005. ''For that, you need a credible military deterrent -- alliances, presence. But you also have to use reassuring language.''

HEADLINE: Why are Oil Majors so Keen on Renewable Energy?

BYLINE: JAMES KANTER


HIGHLIGHT: Just when will oil run out, creating economic and social panic, and putting an end to decades of prosperity based on the plentifulness of petroleum? The answer seems to be "soon," according to a documentary. 

 BODY:
Just when will oil run out, creating economic and social panic, and putting an end to decades of prosperity based on the plentifulness of petroleum? The answer seems to be "soon," according to a documentary called "A Crude Awakening," which I saw this weekend in London before it officially opens in cinemas in London Nov. 9. (The film has already been released in Canada, Switzerland, Australia and New Zealand, and is showing on cable television in the U.S. It will be playing at the Guangzhou International Documentary Film Festival, China, at the beginning of December, according to a Web site promoting the film.)
The film, a 90-minute documentary marshaling evidence of the planet's dwindling oil resources, takes a scathing look at the oil industry's role in environmental degradation and in a series of wars in the Middle East -- including the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States. The filmmakers do not venture a date for "the oil crash" but they make a relentless case for how supplies of oil already have reached a plateau and may even be in decline in some of the world's biggest fields, including in Saudi Arabia. 
Perhaps the most interesting part of the afternoon was the discussion with three energy experts including Chris Skrebowski, the editor of Petroleum Review, following the screening. 
One member of the audience pointed out that some of the world's largest oil companies including BP are taking a lead in investing in renewable sources of energy while other companies, like Total, are warning that the numbers of barrels that can be produced each day by the end of the next decade will seriously undershoot official estimates. So why, this person asked, were some of these same companies so keen to refute evidence that oil is reaching its peak and that supplies actually could run out entirely?
Skrebowski said the reason for the apparent incoherence was simple: Many oil company executives' remuneration is based on options on shares that would likely lose value if news got out that supplies were running so low. Oil executives, alleged Skrebowski, are unwilling to speak frankly about peak oil for fear of "impoverishing themselves."

HEADLINE: Living With Pain That Just Won't Go Away

BYLINE: By JANE E. BRODY

 BODY:
Pain, especially pain that doesn't quit, changes a person. And rarely for the better. The initial reaction to serious pain is usually fear (what is wrong with me, and is it curable?), but pain that fails to respond to treatment leads to anxiety, depression, anger and irritability.
 At age 29, Walter, a computer programmer in Silicon Valley, developed a repetitive stress injury that caused severe pain in his hands when he touched the keyboard. The injury did not respond to rest. The pain became worse, spreading to his shoulders, neck and back. 
 Unable to work, lift, carry or squeeze anything without enduring days of crippling pain, Walter could no longer drive, open a jar or even sign his name. 
 ''At age 29, I was on Social Security disability, basically confined to home, and my life seemed to be over,'' Walter recalls in ''Living With Chronic Pain,'' by Dr. Jennifer Schneider. Severely depressed, he wonders whether his life is worth living. 
 Yet, despite his limited mobility and the pain-induced frown lines in his face, to look at Walter is to see a strapping, healthy young man. It is hard to tell that he, or any other person beset with chronic pain, is suffering as much as he says he is.
 Pain is an invisible, subjective symptom. The body of a chronic pain sufferer -- someone with fibromyalgia, for example, or back pain -- usually appears intact. There are no objective tests to detect pain or measure its intensity. You just have to take a person's word for it.
 Nearly 10 percent of people in the United States suffer from moderate to severe chronic pain, and the prevalence increases with age. Complete relief from chronic pain is rare even with the best treatment, which is itself a rarity. Doctors and patients alike, who misunderstand the effects of narcotics, are too often reluctant to use drugs like opioids, which can relieve acute, as well as chronic, pain and may head off the development of a chronic pain syndrome. 
 Why Pain Persists
 The problems with chronic pain are that it never really ends and does not always respond to treatment. If the pain initially was caused by an injury or illness, it can persist long after the injury has healed or the illness defeated because permanent changes have occurred in the body. 
 Mark Grant, a psychologist in Australia who specializes in managing chronic pain, says the notion that ''physical injury equals pain'' is overly simplistic. ''We now know that pain is caused and maintained by a combination of physical, psychological and neurological factors,'' Mr. Grant writes on his Web site, www.overcomingpain.com. With chronic pain, a persistent physical cause often cannot be determined.
 ''Chronic pain can be caused by muscle tension, changes in circulation, postural imbalances, psychological distress and neurological changes,'' Mr. Grant says on his site. ''It is also known that unrelieved pain is associated with increased metabolic rate, spontaneous excitation of the central nervous system, changes in blood circulation to the brain and changes in the limbic-hypothalamic system,'' the region of the brain that regulates emotions. 
 Dr. Schneider, the author of ''Living With Chronic Pain'' (Healthy Living Books, Hatherleigh Press, 2004), is a specialist in pain management in Tucson, Ariz. In her book, she points out that the nervous system is responsible for the two major types of chronic pain. 
 One, called nociceptive pain, ''arises from injury to muscles, tendons and ligaments or in the internal organs,'' she writes. Undamaged nerve cells responding to an injury outside themselves transmit pain signals to the spinal cord and then to the brain. The resulting pain is usually described as deep and throbbing. Examples include chronic low back pain, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, fibromyalgia, headaches, interstitial cystitis and chronic pelvic pain. 
 The second type, neuropathic pain, ''results from abnormal nerve function or direct damage to a nerve.'' Among the causes are shingles, diabetic neuropathy, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, phantom limb pain, radiculopathy, spinal stenosis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke and spinal cord injury. 
 The damaged nerve fibers ''can fire spontaneously, both at the site of the injury and at other places along the nerve pathway'' and ''can continue indefinitely even after the source of the injury has stopped sending pain messages,'' Dr. Schneider writes.
 ''Neuropathic pain can be constant or intermittent, burning, aching, shooting or stabbing, and it sometimes radiates down the arms or legs,'' she adds. This kind of pain tends ''to involve exaggerated responses to painful stimuli, spread of pain to areas that were not initially painful, and sensations of pain in response to normally nonpainful stimuli such as light touch.'' It is often worse at night and may involve abnormal sensations like tingling, pins and needles, and intense itching.
 Some chronic pain syndromes involve both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. A common example is sciatica; a pinched nerve causes back pain that radiates down the leg. In some cases, the pain of sciatica is not felt in the back but only in the leg, making the cause difficult to diagnose without an M.R.I.
 Beyond Physical Problems
 The consequences of chronic pain typically extend well beyond the discomfort from the sensation of pain itself. Dr. Schneider lists these potential physical effects: poor wound healing, weakness and muscle breakdown, decreased movement that can lead to blood clots, shallow breathing and suppressed coughing that raise the risk of pneumonia, sodium and water retention in the kidneys, raised heart rate and blood pressure, weakened immune system, a slowing of gastrointestinal motility, difficulty sleeping, loss of appetite and weight, and fatigue.
 But that is hardly the end of it. The psychological and social consequences of chronic pain can be enormous. Unremitting pain can rob a person of the ability to enjoy life, maintain important relationships, fulfill spousal and parental responsibilities, perform well at a job or work at all.
 The economic burdens can be severe, especially when the patient is the primary breadwinner or holds a job that provides the family's health insurance. Only about half of patients with chronic pain ''who undergo comprehensive multidisciplinary pain rehabilitation are able to return to work,'' Dr. Schneider reports.
 As for the notion that chronic pain patients are often malingering -- seeking attention and escape from responsibilities -- pain specialists say that is nonsense. No one in his right mind -- and most patients were in their right minds before the pain began -- would trade a fulfilling life for the misery of chronic pain.
 This is the first of three columns on chronic pain. Next week: How family and friends can help.

HEADLINE: Unregulated Electricity Costs More, Studies Say

BYLINE: By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

 BODY:
Retail electricity prices have risen much more in states that adopted competitive pricing than in those that have retained traditional rates set by the government, new studies based on years of price reports show. 
 The findings, by advocates for both sides in the market-versus-regulation debate, raise questions about the reasons market competition produced higher retail prices than government regulation. 
 The difference in prices charged to industrial companies in market states compared with those in regulated ones nearly tripled from 1999 to last July, according to the analysis of Energy Department data by Marilyn Showalter, who runs Power in the Public Interest, a group that favors traditional rate regulation. 
 The price spread grew from 1.09 cents per kilowatt-hour to 3.09 cents, her analysis showed. It also showed that in 2006 alone industrial customers paid $7.2 billion more for electricity in market states than if they had paid the average prices in regulated states.
 Mrs. Showalter compared prices in 13 states and Washington, all of which have adopted market pricing for industrial users, with the rest of the nation. The 13 states are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Texas. Montana is returning to regulated pricing.
 ''Since 1999, prices for industrial customers in deregulated states have risen from 18 percent above the national average to 37 percent above,'' said Mrs. Showalter, an energy lawyer and former Washington State utility regulator.
 In regulated states, prices fell from 7 percent below the national average to 12 percent below, she calculated. 
 That means the difference between market and regulated states nearly doubled, from 25 percentage points to 49 percentage points.
 A separate study for the Electric Power Supply Association, which represents independent power generators and favors market pricing, reported last week that retail prices for all customers ''rose only slightly higher'' than prices in regulated states. A footnote showed that the prices rose 15 percent more in market states than in regulated states.
 Both studies relied on the same Energy Information Administration data , but the supply association counted five more states -- Arizona, Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- as market states. 
 In those five states, the government imposed rate cuts, freezes or caps, some of which are still in effect for residential and some other customers. John Shelk, president of the supply association, said that but for efforts to create competitive markets, government would not have ordered lower prices during a transition from regulation to market pricing. Therefore, he reasoned, government-mandated savings should be included in calculating the benefits of market pricing. 
 Susan F. Tierney of the Analysis Group, a former assistant secretary for policy at the Energy Department during the Clinton administration who conducted the study, said that improvements were needed in both the market and regulated pricing systems. 
 A larger concern, Dr. Tierney said, is how to deal with rising electricity prices driven by the demands of global economic and technological growth, rising fuel prices and the costs of countering atmospheric damage from burning fossil fuels.
 ''Focusing more on those improvements seems more constructive than fighting about whether competition or traditional regulation is the best path,'' she added. 
 The data are the latest to show that competition, which was promoted by big industrial companies and Enron as the best way to create competitive incentives to reduce prices, has instead resulted in higher and faster rising prices. Some big industrial customers have turned against the changes they once championed, saying that if markets produced lower prices they would favor them but that electricity auctions have not worked. 
 In market states, electricity customers of all kinds, from homeowners to electricity-hungry aluminum plants, pay $48 billion more each year for power than they would have paid in states with the traditional system of government boards setting electric rates, according to Mrs. Showalter's analysis of Energy Department data in an earlier report in September.
 Under the rules of these markets, every electric power generator whose bid is accepted gets the highest price paid to supply power, called a clearance price or single-price market. In most auctions, each supplier gets the price at which they offered to sell, known as an as-bid market.
 One result of clearance pricing is that nuclear power plants, which must run at a steady rate even when demand for power is minimal, have at times collected $990 per kilowatt-hour for power they had offered to give away during low-demand hours.
 Gordon van Welie, president of the New England Independent System Operator, which runs the electricity market in that region, said that clearance pricing avoids the costs and risks of taking nuclear plants offline that would occur in an as-bid market if the price they sought was too high to attract any buyers.
 Mr. Van Welie said he anticipated steady improvements in the efficiency of the auction markets over the next few years as rules are refined, and pointed to a report showing that wholesale prices in all markets declined last year compared with 2005, in contrast to the rise in retail paid by those who use the power.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 15, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Nov. 6 about the comparison of electricity prices between states where they are set by the market and states where they are set by regulators misstated a measure of electricity for nuclear power plants, which in unregulated states have at times charged for power they had offered to give away during low-demand hours. The price is per megawatt-hour, not kilowatt-hour.

HEADLINE: A Blossoming Cathedral Tower Sheds Its Scaffolding

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Fifteen years have passed since the stonemasons put down their chisels and mallets for the last time. Now, they can finally see what their carving wrought: the uppermost 55 feet 2 inches of the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine.
 In recent weeks, the cathedral's southwest tower has emerged from the rusty scaffolding that had enclosed it since the last round of construction ended in 1992. The tower is still far from complete, but it has grown noticeably closer to the sky. 
 What is now revealed, in a limestone several shades blonder than the rest of the cathedral, are crisp buttresses, gables, colonettes, gargoyles, pinnacles, crockets and ornaments known as trefoils (three cusps), quatrefoils (four cusps) and cinquefoils (five cusps).
 The tower has a newly imposing presence.
 ''It has been set free from its bondage of scaffolding,'' said the Very Rev. Dr. James A. Kowalski, dean of the cathedral. Perhaps the greatest personal gratification, he said, was felt by those who labored so hard on the tower before the money ran out. ''It was the first time they saw the magnitude of what was accomplished.''
 Less visibly, scaffolding is also being removed now from within the great nave, which has been off limits to worshipers and visitors since June 2006, while undergoing a $16.5 million cleaning and repair of damage from a fire in the north transept in December 2001.
 For now, the crossing and the chapels around the apse are open, reached through a shed that runs through the nave. Above and around that shed, outside of public view, the freshly cleaned interior stonework glows almost as if it were illuminated from within.
 Dr. Kowalski said that worship was expected to resume in the nave next June. By then, the crossing will have to be closed so that the organ can be reinstalled. The entire interior will not reopen until November 2008.
 St. John the Divine, the seat of the Episcopal Church in New York, was begun in 1892. Its architects changed, from Heins & La Farge to Ralph Adams Cram, and its style changed with them, from Romanesque to Gothic. Work stopped because of World War I and World War II. 
 From 1938 to 1982, both of the western towers were truncated for the time being at 150 feet 6 inches, half their intended height.
 Construction resumed on the southwest tower in 1982, employing young city dwellers apprenticed to a master mason from England. ''The stonework will be done by our own unemployed and underemployed neighbors,'' said the Very Rev. James Parks Morton, who was dean at the time.
 A separate for-profit company called Cathedral Stoneworks was set up in 1989 to supply the southwest tower and other projects. The tower reached 205 feet 8 inches before the job was halted again. The stoneworks declared bankruptcy in 1994.
 But the scaffolding stayed up, year after year. ''It accentuated the incompleteness and even a sense of failure,'' Dr. Kowalski said.
 However, he does not see the episodic construction as a sign of defeat. ''Cathedrals are built in fits and starts,'' Dr. Kowalski said. ''They take time.''
 Meanwhile, the church's priorities have changed, as has the neighborhood around it.
 A 20-story apartment building is now under construction on Morningside Drive, at the southeast corner of the Close, as the cathedral grounds are known. To the dismay of some preservationists and neighbors, the site has been leased for 99 years to AvalonBay Communities, which is developing the 296-unit building.
 On completion, the AvalonBay building will be only two feet shorter than the cathedral's southwest tower, though there is such a steep change of grade between the Close and Morningside Drive that it will appear to be 41 feet shorter.

HEADLINE: Yazoo Pumps: They're Back!

 BODY:
Like an indestructible ghoul in a low-grade horror flick, the Yazoo Pumps are rising again from the bureaucratic crypt.
 First proposed in 1941, and kept alive ever since by a complacent Congress, the Yazoo Pumps may well be the most daft in a long line of environmentally destructive schemes undertaken by the Army Corps of Engineers at Congress's request. The project calls for the corps to build the world's largest pumping system, at a cost of more than $200 million, in the Mississippi Delta. The pumps would then drain 200,000 acres of valuable wetlands, hardwood forests and wildlife habitat so that a relatively small number of soybean farmers, who already drink liberally from the public trough, can plant more crops. 
 The project's main champions are Mississippi's two senators, Trent Lott and Thad Cochran, who say it's necessary for the local economy and for flood control, assertions for which no persuasive evidence has ever been produced. The project has long been opposed by scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Fish and Wildlife Service. But it has been kept alive by legislators eager to protect their own deals with the corps and by past E.P.A. administrators who, despite deep personal misgivings, have ducked a decision pending a final environmental impact statement.
 That statement is expected to be published later this week, at which point there will be no further reason not to kill the project. Two officials can do the deed. One is Dirk Kempthorne, the interior secretary, who can refer the project for determination to the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Few projects have survived this referral process. The other official is Stephen Johnson, the current E.P.A. administrator. Mr. Johnson can kill the project outright under section 404 of the Clean Water Act, which requires the E.P.A. to protect wetlands. 
 Over the years, the cozy and durable relationship between the Corps of Engineers and its pork-loving Congressional paymasters has produced one environmental misfortune after another. This is one that the Bush administration can and should prevent.

HEADLINE: Legal Think Tanks

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 In ''Training Law Students for Real-Life Careers'' (news article, Oct. 31), you report that top law schools are modifying first-year curriculums, expanding clinical training programs and more. But there's another area of educational reform that helps law students develop skills in high-level scholarship: multidisciplinary think tanks. 
 At Berkeley Law School, we've launched a set of think tanks to push the frontiers of legal study. These new research centers harness the intellectual capital of the law school and our campus partners to study critical issues facing both private and public sectors, like health care, immigration policy and privacy rights. The centers offer students a chance to work closely with faculty and professional experts across multiple disciplines. 
 At the Center for Law, Business and the Economy, for example, students learn problem-solving techniques while studying the landscape of legal issues and business strategy in a global economy. This approach may prove to be one of the most effective teaching methods in higher education, along with the essential work of training clinics.
 Our legal clinics are also incubators of new ideas in social science. At our community law clinic, students not only get hands-on training, but they also undertake empirical research, studying the outcome of the thousands of cases handled yearly. The results will guide a new generation of policy makers and social scientists willing to tackle the most difficult social problems through a legal lens.

The New York City Central Labor Council plans to begin a campaign today to educate construction workers, truck drivers and other workers in the city to make sure they are not classified as independent contractors instead of as employees. Misclassification often saves employers money while depriving workers of unemployment insurance and workers' compensation protections, the labor council said. The council plans to have dozens of union members distribute leaflets. Gov. Eliot Spitzer has asked state agencies to crack down on misclassification.

HEADLINE: The Price of Sugar

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Sugar's Sweetheart Deal'' (editorial, Oct. 30): 
 The ''world price'' for sugar you commonly refer to is for unprocessed, subsidized sugar, and it does not factor in transportation costs. This is like comparing the price of an orange in Brazil to the price of a carton of orange juice in Manhattan. Food companies in the United States pay less for refined sugar today than they did when Jimmy Carter was in office.
 Food companies in the rest of the developed world pay, on average, 65 percent more for their sugar than American companies do. Grocery shoppers in other developed countries pay 30 percent more for sugar than Americans do. 
 Not only is American sugar affordable, but it's also of the highest quality. The last time we imported large quantities of refined sugar from Mexico, it had to be re-refined to remove metal flakes, hunks of burlap and even rat feces. 
 The House of Representatives passed a farm bill that takes the necessary steps to ensure that the domestic sugar industry, including hundreds of New York jobs, can stay in business in the wake of a flood of unneeded, subsidized imports from Mexico. Luckily, most legislators know that without a strong sugar program we'd have to depend on Mexico for sugar, and that would be a recipe for disaster.

HEADLINE: Dubious Fees Hit Borrowers In Foreclosures

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
As record numbers of homeowners default on their mortgages, questionable practices among lenders are coming to light in bankruptcy courts, leading some legal specialists to contend that companies instigating foreclosures may be taking advantage of imperiled borrowers. 
 Because there is little oversight of foreclosure practices and the fees that are charged, bankruptcy specialists fear that some consumers may be losing their homes unnecessarily or that mortgage servicers, who collect loan payments, are profiting from foreclosures.
 Bankruptcy specialists say lenders and loan servicers often do not comply with even the most basic legal requirements, like correctly computing the amount a borrower owes on a foreclosed loan or providing proof of holding the mortgage note in question. 
 ''Regulators need to look beyond their current, myopic focus on loan origination and consider how servicers' calculation and collection practices leave families vulnerable to foreclosure,'' said Katherine M. Porter, associate professor of law at the University of Iowa. 
 In an analysis of foreclosures in Chapter 13 bankruptcy, the program intended to help troubled borrowers save their homes, Ms. Porter found that questionable fees had been added to almost half of the loans she examined, and many of the charges were identified only vaguely. Most of the fees were less than $200 each, but collectively they could raise millions of dollars for loan servicers at a time when the other side of the business, mortgage origination, has faltered.
 In one example, Ms. Porter found that a lender had filed a claim stating that the borrower owed more than $1 million. But after the loan history was scrutinized, the balance turned out to be $60,000. And a judge in Louisiana is considering an award for sanctions against Wells Fargo in a case in which the bank assessed improper fees and charges that added more than $24,000 to a borrower's loan. 
 Ms. Porter's analysis comes as more homeowners face foreclosure. Testifying before Congress on Tuesday, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com, estimated that two million families would lose their homes by the end of the current mortgage crisis. 
 Questionable practices by loan servicers appear to be enough of a problem that the Office of the United States Trustee, a division of the Justice Department that monitors the bankruptcy system, is getting involved. Last month, It announced plans to move against mortgage servicing companies that file false or inaccurate claims, assess unreasonable fees or fail to account properly for loan payments after a bankruptcy has been discharged. 
 On Oct. 9, the Chapter 13 trustee in Pittsburgh asked the court to sanction Countrywide, the nation's largest loan servicer, saying that the company had lost or destroyed more than $500,000 in checks paid by homeowners in foreclosure from December 2005 to April 2007. 
 The trustee, Ronda J. Winnecour, said in court filings that she was concerned that even as Countrywide misplaced or destroyed the checks, it levied charges on the borrowers, including late fees and legal costs. 
 ''The integrity of the bankruptcy process is threatened when a single creditor dishonors its obligation to provide a truthful and accurate account of the funds it has received,'' Ms. Winnecour said in requesting sanctions.
 A Countrywide spokesman disputed the accusations about the lost checks, saying the company had no record of having received the payments the trustee said had been sent. It is Countrywide's practice not to charge late fees to borrowers in bankruptcy, he said, adding that the company also does not charge fees or costs relating to its own mistakes.
 Loan servicing is extremely lucrative. Servicers, which collect payments from borrowers and pass them on to investors who own the loans, generally receive a percentage of income from a loan, often 0.25 percent on a prime mortgage and 0.50 percent on a subprime loan. Servicers typically generate profit margins of about 20 percent.
 Now that big lenders are originating fewer mortgages, servicing revenues make up a greater percentage of earnings. Because servicers typically keep late fees and certain other charges assessed on delinquent or defaulted loans, ''a borrower's default can present a servicer with an opportunity for additional profit,'' Ms. Porter said.
 The amounts can be significant. Late fees accounted for 11.5 percent of servicing revenues in 2006 at Ocwen Financial, a big servicing company. At Countrywide, $285 million came from late fees last year, up 20 percent from 2005. Late fees accounted for 7.5 percent of Countrywide's servicing revenue last year.
 But these are not the only charges borrowers face. Others include $145 in something called ''demand fees,'' $137 in overnight delivery fees, fax fees of $50 and payoff statement charges of $60. Property inspection fees can be levied every month or so, and fees can be imposed every two months to cover assessments of a home's worth. 
 ''We're talking about millions and millions of dollars that mortgage servicers are extracting from debtors that I think are totally unlawful and illegal,'' said O. Max Gardner III, a lawyer in Shelby, N.C., specializing in consumer bankruptcies. ''Somebody files a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, they make all their payments, get their discharge and then three months later, they get a statement from their servicer for $7,000 in fees and charges incurred in bankruptcy but that were never applied for in court and never approved.'' 
 Some fees levied by loan servicers in foreclosure run afoul of state laws. In 2003, for example, a New York appeals court disallowed a $100 payoff statement fee sought by North Fork Bank. 
 Fees for legal services in foreclosure are also under scrutiny. 
 A class-action lawsuit filed in September in Federal District Court in Delaware accused the Mortgage Electronic Registration System, a home loan registration system owned by Fannie Mae, Countrywide Financial and other large lenders, of overcharging borrowers for legal services in foreclosures. The system, known as MERS, oversees more than 20 million mortgage loans.
 The complaint was filed on behalf of Jose Trevino and Lorry S. Trevino of University City, Mo., whose Washington Mutual loan went into foreclosure in 2006 after the couple became ill and fell behind on payments. 
 Jeffrey M. Norton, a lawyer who represents the Trevinos, said that although MERS pays a flat rate of $400 or $500 to its lawyers during a foreclosure, the legal fees that it demands from borrowers are three or four times that. 
 A spokeswoman for MERS declined to comment.
 Typically, consumers who are behind on their mortgages but hoping to stay in their homes invoke Chapter 13 bankruptcy because it puts creditors on hold, giving borrowers time to put together a repayment plan. 
 Given that a Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves the oversight of a court, the findings in Ms. Porter's study are especially troubling. In July, she presented her paper to the United States trustee, and on Oct. 12 she outlined her data for the National Conference of Bankruptcy Judges in Orlando, Fla.
 With Tara Twomey, who is a lecturer at Stanford Law School and a consultant for the National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys, Ms. Porter analyzed 1,733 Chapter 13 filings made in April 2006. The data were drawn from public court records and include schedules filed under penalty of perjury by borrowers listing debts, assets and income.
 Though bankruptcy laws require documentation that a creditor has a claim on the property, 4 out of 10 claims in Ms. Porter's study did not attach such a promissory note. And one in six claims was not supported by the itemization of charges required by law. 
 Without proper documentation, families must choose between the costs of filing an objection or the risk of overpayment, Ms. Porter concluded. 
 She also found that some creditors ask for fees, like fax charges and payoff statement fees, that would probably be considered ''unreasonable'' by the courts. 
 Not surprisingly, these fees may contribute to the other problem identified by her study: a discrepancy between what debtors think they owe and what creditors say they are owed. 
 In 96 percent of the claims Ms. Porter studied, the borrower and the lender disagreed on the amount of the mortgage debt. In about a quarter of the cases, borrowers thought they owed more than the creditors claimed, but in about 70 percent, the creditors asserted that the debt owed was greater than the amounts specified by borrowers. 
 The median difference between the amounts the creditor and the borrower submitted was $1,366; the average was $3,533, Ms. Porter said. In 30 percent of the cases in which creditors' claims were higher, the discrepancy was greater than 5 percent of the homeowners' figure. 
 Based on the study, mortgage creditors in the 1,733 cases put in claims for almost $6 million more than the loan debts listed by borrowers in the bankruptcy filings. The discrepancies are too big, Ms. Porter said, to be simple record-keeping errors.
 Michael L. Jones, a homeowner going through a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in Louisiana, experienced such a discrepancy with Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. After being told that he owed $231,463.97 on his mortgage, he disputed the amount and ultimately sued Wells Fargo.
 In April, Elizabeth W. Magner, a federal bankruptcy judge in Louisiana, ruled that Wells Fargo overcharged Mr. Jones by $24,450.65, or 12 percent more than what the court said he actually owed. The court attributed some of that to arithmetic errors but found that Wells Fargo had improperly added charges, including $6,741.67 in commissions to the sheriff's office that were not owed, almost $13,000 in additional interest and fees for 16 unnecessary inspections of the borrowers' property in the 29 months the case was pending.
 ''Incredibly, Wells Fargo also argues that it was debtor's burden to verify that its accounting was correct,'' the judge wrote, ''even though Wells Fargo failed to disclose the details of that accounting until it was sued.'' 
 A Wells Fargo spokesman, Kevin Waetke, said the bank would not comment on the details of the case as the bank is appealing a motion by Mr. Jones for sanctions. ''All of our practices and procedures in the handling of bankruptcy cases follow applicable laws, and we stand behind our actions in this case,'' he said.
 In Texas, a United States trustee has asked for sanctions against Barrett Burke Wilson Castle Daffin & Frappier, a Houston law firm that sues borrowers on behalf of the lenders, for providing inaccurate information to the court about mortgage payments made by homeowners who sought refuge in Chapter 13. 
 Michael C. Barrett, a partner at the firm, said he did not expect the firm to be sanctioned. 
 ''We certainly believe we have not misbehaved in any way,'' he said, saying the trustee's office became involved because it is trying to persuade Congress to increase its budget. ''It is trying to portray itself as an organ to pursue mortgage bankers.''
 Closing arguments in the case are scheduled for Dec. 12.

HEADLINE: A Pointless Slap at Transit Workers

 BODY:
For three days at the height of the December 2005 holiday season, New York City transit workers engaged in an illegal strike that stranded everyone who was dependent on subways and buses. It was maddening, dangerous and bad for the economy, and the union was punished for it. Now the city wants to keep the bad feelings alive by denying the union the right to collect dues through an automatic checkoff. Rather than continue the acrimony, the city should try to help usher in more peaceful labor-management relations. 
 The transit strike violated the state's Taylor Law, which bars strikes by essential public employees. The union deserved the $2.5 million in fines it was slapped with. Since June, however, that punishment was compounded by a court order denying the Transport Workers Union direct collection of dues from paychecks, leaving the union to ask members for voluntary payment. Mayor Michael Bloomberg wants a state judge to deny a union request to reinstate the checkoff, the loss of which has cost the union more than $1 million so far.
 The dues checkoff is now caught in a legal tangle. The court said direct collection could be reinstated if the union affirmed that ''it no longer asserts the right to strike.'' The president of the union's Local 100, Roger Toussaint, submitted an affidavit to that effect, using language taken from the Taylor Law. Both the city's lawyers and state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo were dissatisfied with that, but the city went further, rejecting the Toussaint statement as ''lip service.''
 This quibbling does no one any good. Changing the language in Mr. Toussaint's statement won't make striking any more illegal, nor will it make the union's promises more persuasive. There are more important issues to focus on, beginning with the mutual distrust between management and the union that has yet to be overcome.
 Now would be a good time for a fresh start. Lee Sander, who this year took over as chief executive of the state-run Metropolitan Transportation Authority, seems to be able to work with Mr. Toussaint. Neither, so far, has had anything bad to say about the other -- a refreshing change for M.T.A.-union relations. Mr. Sander has offered a compromise: allow a probationary reinstatement on dues collections, which could be withdrawn if the union threatens to strike.
 It is a reasonable middle ground. All parties should seize on it and turn to upgrading safety, improving service and keeping costs in line -- the real issues that matter to riders and workers.

HEADLINE: Dell to Pay $1.4 Billion For Storage Company

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

 BODY:
Dell said yesterday that it would acquire EqualLogic for $1.4 billion in a move to claim a larger share of the data storage market.
 The deal, Dell's largest acquisition to date and its fourth this year, comes as the company is trying to stage a corporate turnaround and reclaim ground lost to more nimble competitors. 
 Michael S. Dell, who returned to Dell as chief executive in January, said the acquisition would help Dell simplify corporate storage for companies as they grappled with more data than ever before.
 ''Storage is the fastest part of Dell's business,'' Mr. Dell said in an interview. ''There's an explosion in the amount of data being consumed.''
 Mr. Dell said data storage today accounted for about $2.4 billion of Dell's revenue of about $57 billion, but that figure, he said, is growing rapidly.
 The privately held EqualLogic, based in Nashua, N.H., is the leading provider of the Internet-based storage technology known as iSCSI. It aims to make it easier for businesses to store data by using existing networks rather than installing a costly new dedicated fiber optics network. 
 Mr. Dell said iSCSI technology represented the fastest-growing segment of the overall storage industry. 
 Andrew Reichman, an analyst with Forrester Research, said the deal would help Dell meet the growing storage demands of small and medium-sized companies that typically lack dedicated technology employees to deal with complex storage issues. 
 ''These companies have been seeing tremendous data growth, and they need help dealing with it,'' he said. ''EqualLogic allows them to do that in an easy and cost-effective way. I'd say that supports Dell's strategy, which is about simplification.'' 
 Mr. Reichman said that as part of Dell, EqualLogic would benefit from the company's willingness to invest heavily in research and development.
 In a research note yesterday after the announcement, analysts at Goldman Sachs said: ''The die is cast. Dell is now beginning to build an independent presence in storage.''
 EqualLogic reported revenue of $68.1 million in 2006 and a net loss of $500,000. During the first six months of 2007, it reported revenue of $53.2 million and a net loss of $1.5 million. Dell executives said the deal would reduce Dell's earnings by 2 to 5 cents a share for fiscal 2009 and 2010, excluding the amortization of intangibles. Shares of Dell fell 8 cents yesterday to $29.97 after the deal was announced.
 Mr. Dell said the company would continue to grow through acquisitions and industry partnerships as well as by expansion of existing business. ''We told you we were going to make some changes this year,'' he said.
 EqualLogic's technology is part of a growing category known as virtualization, which allows a single computer to function like multiple computers. Virtualization has attracted independents like VMware and industry giants like Microsoft to vie for a share of the market. 
 EqualLogic filed for an initial public offering in August, but no date had been set. 
 The acquisition, already approved by the boards of both companies, is awaiting regulatory approval. Dell expects the deal to close late this year or early next year.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths KAPLAN, MADGE

 BODY:
 KAPLAN--Madge. Commissioner of Community Services and Political Activist, 73. Madge Kaplan was a tireless advocate for social justice. Growing up in the Bay Ridge Section of Brooklyn during the 40's she became part of the charged political atmosphere of the times. She would often be found cutting high school classes to attend political speeches in Columbus Circle. 
Kaplan marched for civil rights along side Martin Luther King and spearheaded political campaigns for social justice and human rights. She was the backbone of many political campaigns for progressive causes and was a mentor for young people entering the political arena. ''If there was a progressive cause or battle, Madge was there to help lead the charge,'' said State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli, a long time neighbor and colleague. She served as a committee person for the Democratic Party and Democratic Zone leader. After she was Democratic Zone Leader, she was First Vice Chair of the Nassau Democratic County Committee and President of the Nassau Library System board of Trustee. During 1979 and 1980 she was President of the Reform Democratic Association. She is a founding member of the Working Families Party. As Commissioner of Community Services for the town of North Hempstead, Kaplan served with dedication and distinction since 2004. She spearheaded an effort to revitalized the department and developed a number of new programs addressing a wide range of social issues from gang violence, to the environment and senior care. The most recognized of the programs is ''Project Independence'', a revolutionary empowerment program that allow seniors to remain in their homes. Madge Kaplan was a resident of Great Neck, NY for the last 50 years. Her home was always opened to people who had fallen on hard times. Kaplan believed that everyone had a story to tell and everyone was of equal value. Her daughter says that in her home growing up businessmen and the homeless sat side by side at the dinner table each sharing their stories. She had a truly unique ability to see needs and gaps in services and to mobilize others to help meet those needs. A brilliant student, she graduated high school and went to the University of Colorado at age 15, where she completed a graduate degree in psychology. After graduating she worked for Barton's Chocolate as a consultant and helped in the re-organization plan for the New York Central Railroad. She went on to work as a management consultant for the Joynt Group. She than worked for the Communication Workers of America as a political consultant. She worked as coordinator for the Nassau Employment Initiative and Housing Program for FEGS Health and Human Services System in Hempstead. Kaplan, a founder and member of the Working Families Party, left a lasting impression on Jon Kaiman, Supervisor of North Hempstead. ''She had an extraordinary way about her'' he said. ''She never sacrificed substance and she always stood for her principles.'' Kaplan was a member of the NY Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International NARAL and other organizations fighting for the preservation of civil liberties. She was voted Women of the Year by the Eleanor Roosevelt Chapter of the American Jewish Congress. She is a recipient of the Martin Luther King Political Empowerment Award by the Economic Opportunity Council of Nassau County, The Allard Lowenstein award from the American Jewish Congress and the Community Service Award from the Community Organization for Parents and Youth. Madge Kaplan's life-long devotion to social justice and human rights ended on October 31, when she died in her home after a long illness. She was 73. A Celebration of her life will be held on November 17 from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. at Clinton G. Martin Park, 1601 Marcus Ave, New Hyde Park. In lieu of flowers, her family requests that donations be made to the Great Neck Student Aid Fund, Inc, at P.O. Box 1067, Great Neck, NY 11023. She is survived by her daughter Nancy Kaplan of Redmond, WA, Kenneth Kaplan of Escondido, CA and Steven Kaplan of Port Washington, NY. Other survivors include 11 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Economy Catching Up as an Issue

BYLINE: By DALIA SUSSMAN

 BODY:
The Iraq war looms large, but a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll finds increasing concern about the economy. 
 Three in 10 Americans, including as many Democrats as Republicans, called the economy one of the top two issues in the presidential election. 
 A higher proportion, 45 percent, cited the Iraq war. Other results in the poll, conducted Oct. 29 to Nov. 1, indicate broad anxiety about the economy, which could take an important role in shaping the race. 
 Nearly two-thirds rated the national economy negatively, up seven percentage points since April and 19 points since October 2006. Nearly 7 in 10 said they thought a recession was likely in the next year. DALIA SUSSMAN

HEADLINE: Gates Questions China on Military Growth

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates looked directly on Monday into two of the most striking facets of modern China.
 One is what Pentagon officials say is China's aggressive modernization of its armed forces. The other is its even more aggressive expansion of the economy and its growing global role. 
 ''China's increasing political and economic stature calls for this country to take on a greater share of responsibility for the health and success of the international system,'' said Mr. Gates, who is making his first visit to China since becoming defense secretary.
 Mr. Gates, standing alongside Gen. Cao Gangchuan, China's defense minister, at a news conference, also said he had raised ''the uncertainty over China's military modernization and the need for greater transparency to allay international concerns.''
 Pentagon officials describe China as a ''peer competitor'' -- hardly an adversary, often a partner, yet not a reliable, close ally. The defense secretary's visit was intended to nurture this complex relationship and press for more open communication over military issues. No major breakthroughs on policy issues were expected during two days of talks, which will conclude Tuesday after a meeting with Hu Jintao, the Chinese president.
 Mr. Gates said his discussions were marked by agreements and disagreements. The two sides announced new steps toward establishing a telephone hot line to avert misunderstandings between their militaries. This was viewed as significant by senior Pentagon officials, who said the Chinese government did not have such a line with any other nation.
 Mr. Gates and his counterparts also announced an agreement to organize a new joint naval exercise, larger and more complex than previous exercises; a plan to exchange military students; and a promise to open Chinese archives to help account for American soldiers still listed as missing from the Korean War.
 When asked to respond to American criticisms of the military and expansion, General Cao, the defense minister, replied, ''It has been a normal deployment of our military force in our own territory.''
 Mr. Gates acknowledged that he had made little headway in getting answers from the Chinese on their unannounced test of an antisatellite weapon in January, in which they destroyed an aging Chinese weather satellite. Western governments pressed for an explanation, but the Chinese government took nearly two weeks to publicly confirm the test and to say it had no plans for a space race. Worries over the circumstances and motive of the test remain. 
 ''I raised our concerns about it, and there was no further discussion,'' Mr. Gates said.
 Mr. Gates also said he had raised with his Chinese hosts ''the importance of increased pressures'' to persuade Iran to drop any plans to develop nuclear weapons.
 China has growing economic ties with Iran. During Monday's meetings, Chinese officials expressed an understanding that the nation's goal of steady energy supplies to power its economy could be threatened by nuclear proliferation in the Middle East, according to senior Pentagon officials traveling with Mr. Gates.
 One senior official, speaking on standard diplomatic rules of anonymity to describe the private talks, said late Monday that Chinese officials had agreed that ''a nuclear-armed Iran is something we are united in opposing.''

HEADLINE: New Jersey Ballot Asks Voters to Allow More Debt

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 2 

 BODY:
At a groundbreaking for the Stem Cell Institute of New Jersey recently, Gov. Jon S. Corzine drove a spade into the dirt and declared the site the ''nexus of cutting-edge scientific breakthroughs.''
 At first glance, the institute has just about everything a state facility could ask for: the full-throated backing of the state's political leadership, $270 million for construction costs, and plans for research centers across the state.
 But voters must still approve the $450 million bond plan to pay for the scientists and the research they are to do there. It is one of many issues New Jersey voters will face in Tuesday's election, which will also determine the makeup of the State Legislature. All 120 legislators are up for re-election in the state's 40 districts -- each electing two Assembly members and a senator -- and four statewide ballot initiatives will decide how the state spends money, allocates sales tax revenue and sets voting rights for the mentally disabled. 
 A referendum to finance stem cell research is one of two proposals that New Jersey voters are being asked to approve that would add to the state's debt load, which currently exceeds $30 billion, or about as much as the annual state budget. 
 The second ballot proposal on spending would give New Jersey, the nation's most densely populated state, the authority to borrow $200 million more to preserve open spaces. 
 Another proposal would set aside sales tax revenue to finance property tax rebates. And a fourth would remove a clause from the State Constitution that states ''no idiot or insane person shall enjoy the right of suffrage.'' 
 Taken together, borrowing $650 million and diverting sales tax revenue has raised the question of whether it is the right time for the state to take on more debt. But independent government finance experts said that, for a variety of reasons, adding to the state's tab was actually not as risky as it might appear to be.
 ''There's no tipping the balance here,'' said Mark Tenenhaus, a vice president with Moody's Investors Service, who monitors New Jersey's financial situation. ''What you've got to keep in mind, too, it is an extremely wealthy state with a lot of resources.''
 Although New Jersey seems to perpetually grapple with revenue shortages and budget deficits, it had the highest median income in the nation -- $64,169 -- according to the Census Bureau's most recent three-year estimate, from 2004 to 2006. Tax revenue for the first quarter of this fiscal year was higher than the state initially estimated. And despite New Jersey's having some of the largest debt burdens in the nation, it has recently slowed its pace of borrowing.
 ''An additional $600 million or so is not really going to do anything to the state's debt numbers,'' said Richard J. Marino, an analyst for Standard & Poor's who studies New Jersey.
 Financial experts also said that the plan to issue more bonds was unobjectionable because of what will be done with the money.
 ''Issuing more debt is a problem, but these are two pretty important issues for the state,'' said Richard F. Keevey, director of Princeton University's Policy Research Institute for the Region. In addition, he said that the state was not borrowing money to pay for its operational expenses, as it had done in the past.
 Advocates for the stem cell proposal contended that the borrowing would help pay for research that could help deliver New Jersey from financial distress by bringing additional tax revenue and tens of thousands of jobs to the state. Those supporting the land preservation initiative said that it would prevent overdevelopment and preserve the state's natural beauty. 
 Critics of both borrowing measures have said that the two initiatives constituted yet more expenses that taxpayers should not have to shoulder. The New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity, an interest group that advocates lower taxes, is loudly opposing all three budget-related ballot proposals with radio and television commercials. 
 In addition, a group of anti-abortion activists led by New Jersey Right to Life has raised moral objections to issuing the bonds for stem cell research, arguing that it could lead to state-financed human cloning experiments. The group filed a lawsuit trying to remove the question from the ballot but was unsuccessful.
 Mr. Corzine opposes the sales tax initiative, saying it would limit the state's financial flexibility. He has forcefully stood behind the other two proposals. Politically -- and personally -- he is most invested in the stem cell research program. He recently donated $150,000 of his own money to a political action committee that is running radio advertisements featuring the actor Michael J. Fox, who has Parkinson's disease and has been an advocate of the research.
 The Corzine administration and New Jersey for Hope, the political action committee, recently stepped up their public relations campaign to counteract what they see as a potentially effective effort by the groups opposed to the stem cell ballot measure.
 Holding the groundbreaking ceremony at Rutgers University in New Brunswick even before voters decide the matter -- a move that stem cell research opponents called audacious -- was intentional, said an administration official who helped plan the strategy but who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the person was not authorized to talk about it.
 Mr. Corzine was out campaigning for the ballot proposal again on Friday, touring a laboratory at a biotechnology company in Warren, where stem cell research is being conducted.
 The Corzine administration and other proponents of the measure said that stem cell research -- and the tax receipts and other economic benefits from the companies conducting the work -- would go to other states if New Jersey did not offer considerable financial backing.
 ''You need to show the world a strong financial commitment,'' said Assemblyman Neil M. Cohen, a Democrat who supports the state's efforts to finance the research.
 Those efforts seem to be paying off. A recent Rutgers poll showed that likely voters favored the ballot proposal, 57 percent to 36 percent. The same poll found that 59 percent of voters supported the open spaces referendum, while 34 percent opposed it.
 Building the research facilities and offering financing is, of course, no guarantee that the stem cell program will succeed.
 ''Where it can provide jobs and increase the economy, that's a positive,'' Mr. Marino of Standard & Poor's said. ''But until it actually happens, it's difficult to judge what kind of an impact it will have.''

HEADLINE: British Intelligence Chief Sharpens Terrorism Warning

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL

DATELINE: LONDON, Nov. 5 

 BODY:
Britain's chief domestic intelligence official said Monday that at least 2,000 people in Britain posed a ''direct threat to national security and public safety'' because of their support for terrorism, an increase of 400 in the last year. 
 The figure is not new -- Prime Minister Gordon Brown mentioned it in July. But the official, Jonathan Evans, director general of MI5, went even further, saying there may be 2,000 more would-be terrorists not yet known to the authorities. 
 Speaking at a conference in Manchester, Mr. Evans also said that extremists in Britain were more likely than before to be connected to networks in other countries, and that they were increasingly grooming young people, including children, to carry out terrorist attacks. And in a reminder that even though the cold war has ended, some of the old conflicts persist, he complained that MI5 was being forced to divert resources from antiterrorism work ''to defend the U.K. against unreconstructed attempts by Russia, China and others to spy on us.'' 
 Mr. Evans's stark assessment of the terrorist threat echoes remarks by his predecessor at MI5, Dame Eliza Manningham-Buller, in November 2006. But it is still highly unusual for the chief of MI5, which so shuns publicity that it does not even have a press office, to speak publicly. 
 Opponents of the government, however, pointed out that the speech comes as Mr. Brown prepares to make new proposals for stricter antiterrorism laws. In July, Mr. Brown said he was considering introducing legislation that would increase the time that suspects could be detained without charge, to 56 days from the current 28.
 The matter is highly contentious. In 2005, after a bitter debate, Parliament rejected a government proposal to increase the allowable detention time before charges are brought to 90 days. 
 ''It is crucial that the security services do not get drawn into politics,'' Nick Clegg, the home affairs spokesman for the opposition Liberal Democrats, said in a statement. ''Experience suggests that breathless talk about the terrorism threat and the powers needed to counter it can have a damaging effect on opinion in precisely those communities that we need to keep on our side.''
 Mr. Evans was indeed bleak in his outlook, saying he believed that the terrorist threat had not reached its peak and that new recruits were arriving in a ''steady flow.'' 
 ''Terrorist attacks we have seen against the U.K. are not simply random plots by disparate and fragmented groups,'' he said. ''The majority of these attacks, successful or otherwise, have taken place because Al Qaeda has a clear determination to mount terrorist attacks against the United Kingdom.'' 
 He said that the would-be terrorists were cultivating ever younger volunteers and that people as young as 15 had been implicated in terrorist activity. 
 ''As I speak, terrorists are methodically and intentionally targeting young people and children in this country,'' he said. ''They are radicalizing, indoctrinating and grooming young, vulnerable people to carry out acts of terrorism.'' 
 Since the attacks on London's transportation network in 2005, which left 56 people dead, including the four suicide bombers, the British authorities have arrested hundreds of people as terrorism suspects and reported that many would-be attacks have been thwarted. A foiled plan in July to set off explosions in London and Glasgow was the 15th attempted terrorist plot on British soil since 2001, officials say. More than 200 people have been convicted of terrorism-related offenses in Britain in the last six years.
 Officials say the police and security services are currently dealing with about 30 suspected plots and 200 terrorist-related groups or networks. 
 Striking a slightly defensive note, Mr. Evans said his agents were ''under acute pressure to prioritize'' and could not monitor every threat. ''There will be instances when individuals come to the notice of the security service or the police, but then subsequently carry out acts of terrorism,'' he said. ''Every decision to investigate someone entails a decision not to investigate someone else.'' 
 He also said espionage activities by Russia and China, among other countries, were siphoning resources from the fight against terrorism. ''A number of countries continue to devote considerable time and energy trying to steal our sensitive technology on civilian and military projects, and trying to obtain political and economic intelligence at our expense,'' he said. 
 Mr. Evans was particularly pointed in criticizing Russia, whose relationship with Britain has cooled considerably in recent months. 
 ''Since the end of the cold war,'' he said, ''we have seen no decrease in the numbers of undeclared Russian intelligence officers in the U.K. -- at the Russian Embassy and associated organizations conducting covert activity in this country.'' 
 A man answering the phone at the Russian Embassy here said he could not comment on the assertion that it was harboring spies. 
 Prison Term in 2005 Bombings
 LONDON, Nov. 5 (Reuters) -- A man accused of helping to plot botched 2005 bombings in London was sentenced Monday to six years, nine months after pleading guilty to a lesser offense.
 Adel Yahya, who was born in Ethiopia, was one of six men tried on charges of plotting attacks on the transport system on July 21, 2005, two weeks after suicide bombers killed 56 people, including themselves, in London.
 Detectives said the second plot failed only because the homemade bombs failed to explode.
 Mr. Yahya was accused of being central to the plot, but not of being one of the four men who tried to carry out the attacks. 
 While four of the five others were convicted and sentenced to life in prison for conspiracy to murder, the jury reached no verdict on Mr. Yahya and on the sixth man, Manfo Kwaku Asiedu.
 On Monday, a week before his scheduled retrial, Mr. Yahya pleaded guilty to collecting information useful for militants.

HEADLINE: Bush To Nominate Gargano

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
President Bush will nominate Charles A. Gargano, a close confidant of former Gov. George E. Pataki, to be ambassador to Austria, the White House announced yesterday. Mr. Gargano, left, was Mr. Pataki's top economic development official, and became vice chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. He was a prominent Republican fund-raiser in the 1980s, and at the end of the Reagan presidency was named ambassador to Trinidad and Tobago. Gov. Eliot Spitzer has said that the economic development effort was misdirected under Mr. Gargano and did not provide enough jobs to justify the public investment, and that he will change the way the state approaches economic development.

HEADLINE: Hillary's Tough Sell

BYLINE: BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
The U.S. is in the midst of the most important presidential election campaign since World War II, and if there has ever been a time when women voters had the opportunity to decisively affect the nation's future, it's now.
 Hillary Clinton's historic candidacy has heightened the interest of women voters who would no doubt have been paying close attention to this election in any event because of its classic lineup of issues, including the war in Iraq, a highly uncertain economy and the makeover of the Supreme Court, with its implications for abortion, civil liberties and so on. 
 A national poll conducted for the Lifetime television network showed that nearly 40 percent of women feel that voting in the 2008 election will be more important than in previous years. And an overwhelming majority of women who are registered to vote say they plan to go to the polls.
 But most of those voters are not yet committed to a particular candidate.
 That means there's a treasure trove of potential votes out there among women. But except for the recent flap over the treatment of Senator Clinton in last week's debate, the campaigns are nearly all being waged as if the only votes that really matter are those of dimwitted guys fascinated by big guns and insecure in their masculinity.
 Six years after Sept. 11 and nearly five years into the absurd war in Iraq, the election talk is still mostly mindless macho chatter about who's toughest; who would be best at shoving Iran around; who would be most extreme in dealing with terror.
 Incredibly, torture is still on the table.
 Most of the candidates would rather be locked in a cell and forced to listen to endless loops of Rush Limbaugh monologues than spend quality time on issues like pay equity or child care or anything else that might be of particular interest to women.
 The Lifetime poll was part of the cable network's nonpartisan ''Every Woman Counts'' campaign, which is designed to encourage women to vote and speak out on important issues. The poll and an extensive series of interviews (unrelated to the poll) indicate that among women, Senator Clinton has an advantage but has not yet closed the deal.
 Cautious to a fault (like most Democrats), she has not generated the kind of excitement among women that one might have expected from the first woman with a serious shot at winning the White House.
 Among women who have already made up their minds, more than half -- 56 percent -- favor Mrs. Clinton. But, according to the poll, only 22 percent have made up their minds.
 When you talk to women about how they feel about Mrs. Clinton, you find that their reactions are staggeringly complex. Some are obviously crazy about her. Some seem to like her and loathe her at the same time, and for reasons they have trouble articulating.
 Many want to see a woman elected president, but would rather have someone other than Mrs. Clinton as the standard-bearer. And a substantial number will bring up, without prompting, Bill Clinton's misadventures with other women.
 If there is one word to describe the feeling of many women about Senator Clinton it might be: ambivalence.
 A woman from Coral Gables, Fla., said: ''I resent the fact that so many believe that Hillary speaks for all women. She does not. I admire her and I think she is well-qualified, but she lacks heart.''
 It may be that George W. Bush and the Republicans are so unpopular now that Senator Clinton or just about any Democrat will be able to waltz into the White House. But that's a dangerous belief for any Democrat to have a year in advance of the election.
 If Senator Clinton is unable to generate tremendous enthusiasm among women voters she is unlikely to win. She needs a big turnout among Democrats in general and women in particular to overcome the built-in opposition to her candidacy on the right and among men and women who won't vote for a woman under any circumstances.
 Thirty-nine percent of the women who responded to the Lifetime poll said that they would not vote for Senator Clinton, and another 7 percent said that they would not vote for any woman under any circumstance.
 The flaw in the Clinton campaign so far has been the absence of real leadership -- the failure of the candidate to galvanize supporters with a vision so compelling as to be almost irresistible.
 ''She's wishy-washy,'' said one woman.
 The problem for the terminally timid Democrats is that this is not just a flaw in the Clinton campaign, but a potentially devastating flaw in the entire Democratic presidential field.

HEADLINE: Bond Buyers Are Losing Confidence

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
After a recuperative October, investors in the credit markets are starting to feel a familiar sense of dread.
 Investors and analysts say the large write-downs of mortgage securities by Citigroup and Merrill Lynch have unnerved the debt markets in the last week, though conditions are generally better than they were during the credit crisis in August. 
 Investors say they are most troubled by the accelerating pace of write-downs and credit downgrades in the residential mortgage area, but they are also starting to question the value of bonds in related areas like commercial mortgages and consumer debt. For instance, an index that tracks the cost of protecting bonds tied to commercial mortgages has surged since the end of October. 
 ''In the market right now, things feel pretty fragile,'' said Derrick M. Wulf, a portfolio manager at Dwight Asset Management, an investment firm based in Burlington, Vt. ''And it's a function of people losing confidence, no longer believing everything they hear.''
 Unlike in August, the markets for the investment-grade debt issued by nonfinancial corporations are functioning fairly normally, though prices are not as lofty as they were earlier in the year, analysts say.
 Prices on riskier assets are falling, however, with high-yield debt falling steadily in the last three days of trading. The yield on those bonds, which moves in the opposite direction of price, jumped to 9.41 percent yesterday, from 9 percent at the end of October, according to the Finra-Bloomberg Active High Yield US Corporate Bond Index.
 In the stock market, the worst losses have come among financial stocks, which are down 7.3 percent in the last five days. By contrast, technology and utility stocks are up about 1 percent. Trading is most strained in residential mortgage securities that are not guaranteed by government-chartered agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
 ''Buyers are very nervous about defaults in these securities,'' said Christian Stracke, an analyst at CreditSights, a bond research firm. ''It's not that the buyers don't know what the value of these securities is. It's that they believe it's very low and the sellers are not ready to come to terms with that fact.''
 In the last few days, though, many big banks have been forced to acknowledge that the securities may be worth a lot less than they thought. Citigroup said yesterday that it would take at least through the middle of next year to clean up the mess from credit market losses. Its stock fell another 4.9 percent yesterday despite assurances from company officials that it would maintain its dividend.
 In part, they are responding to a wave of downgrades to highly rated bonds issued by collateralized debt obligations, which in turn hold other bonds. ''These downgrades are happening quicker than the banks can write down these securities,'' said Ed Rombach, a derivatives market analyst at Thomson Financial.
 In a sign of the secondary effects that are still to come from the downgrades of mortgage securities, Fitch Ratings said yesterday that it was reviewing its ratings of financial guarantors that insure many of the debt obligations that have been downgraded in recent weeks. 
 Investors are also increasingly expressing concern about the health of the commercial mortgage market after a boom that was similar to the run-up in the residential market. In recent years developers built scores of office buildings, hotels and condominium towers in New York, Miami, Las Vegas and other big cities. At the height of that market this year, bankers were lending 100 percent or more of the value of projects being built or refinanced.
 Default rates have been at historic lows because of low vacancy rates and rising real estate values. But investors are increasingly betting that they will rise as the economy and the job market weakens, according to trading in the CMBX index from the Markit Group which tracks the cost of insuring against losses in commercial mortgage bonds.
 Another sign of growing stress in that market comes from data on how many commercial loans are being packaged into securities by investment banks. In October, banks issued just $8.6 billion in commercial mortgage deals, down from a monthly average of nearly $66 billion for the first nine months of the year, according to Thomson Financial. Commercial securitizations peaked at $131 billion in June and have since fallen steadily.
 ''Across the board, it's tough to see these things go as far as subprime has,'' Mr. Stracke said about commercial mortgage bonds. ''But that's not to say there is not more trouble ahead.''

HEADLINE: Is Burning Coal a Patriotic Duty?

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: A controversial advertisement defending coal plants in Kansas has local, national and global elements.

 BODY:
Coal companies and utilities have tried a new approach in defending black combustible rock as the fuel of the future, at least in Kansas. 
They helped pay for newspaper ads there on Monday criticizing the decision last month by the administration of Gov. Kathleen Sebelius to deny air-quality permits for two 700-megawatt coal-burning plants. The denials were based on health and environmental risks from global warming.
Such ads are not unusual. But these particular ads were topped by three cheery images of heads of state with rather low approval numbers in the United States - Presidents Mahmoud Amadinejad of Iran, Hugo Chavez of Venezuela and Vladimir Putin of Russia. 
"Why are these men smiling?" asked the advertisement, which was paid for by Kansans for Affordable Energy, a group that has received financial backing from a local utility, Sunflower Electric Power, and the world's largest private coal company, Peabody Energy. 
The answer: "Because the recent decision by the Sebelius Administration means Kansas will import more natural gas from countries like Russia, Venezuela, and Iran."
The ad went on to say that the United States has 250 years' worth of coal in the ground at current rates of use, and that only imports of liquefied natural gas, much of it from hostile countries, would be able to supply power if coal is off limits.
"Without new coal-fueled plants in our state, experts predict that electric bills will skyrocket and Kansans will be more dependent than ever on hostile, foreign energy sources," the ad said. 
Is this evidence that the "politics of fear" that Dot Earth and The Times blog City Room explored the other day is not limited to environmental campaigners trying to prod Americans to take global warming seriously?
Dave Roberts, a contributor to the environmental blog Gristmill, was highly critical of the ad campaign, saying, "Nothing like a little overt xenophobia to liven up the energy debate."
For her part, Governor Sebelius issued a statement defending her decision to deny the permits and calling the ads "offensive to every Kansan."
"Anyone who would associate our state with the controversial and disreputable world leaders pictured in this ad fundamentally misunderstands and disrespects the people of Kansas," she said, adding that the ad "does a real disservice to Kansans who are looking for an honest and constructive debate about our state's energy future."
On its Web site, Sunflower Electric Power posted a news release from the Kansas group that published the ad, saying it was a response to "deceptive" advertising by anti-coal groups with links to the natural gas industry. 
Some useful context is provided in a blog post by the Wichita Eagle's editorial-page editors.
A spokesman for Peabody Energy confirmed that the company had contributed to the group that ran the ads. I asked for the company's reaction to the criticisms of the ad and will post an update when the response comes. 
[UPDATE 11/07: This response from Peabody Energy got buried in my in box until now. Apologies: "We are pleased to support the message behind Kansans for Affordable Energy, which is that we can choose inexpensive U.S. energy sources such as clean coal, or we can jeopardize our future from risky foreign sources. Experts agree that increased natural gas use will come from imports. The global energy markets are interconnected. Russia, Iran and Venezuela combined control nearly half of the world's gas reserves... and do not have Kansas' best interests at heart. To assume America can repeat the import philosophy on natural gas that it has pursued for decades in oil is to ignore the new political, economic and geologic realities of the world. We need all forms of energy, including America's most abundant source."-- Vic Svec, Senior Vice President -- Investor Relations and Corporate Communications]
What's your take on this ad campaign and the underlying issues? 
Given that the United States, China and other countries sit on vast reserves of coal, and that vast volumes of carbon dioxide will come from conventional use of this energy source, what is the best way forward?

HEADLINE: For Fiji Water, a Big List of Green Goals

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
Fiji Water, with annual sales of about $150 million, is but a drop in the bucket of the $15 billion domestic bottled-water industry. But little Fiji could make a big splash on the sustainability front. 
 Let other companies talk about going carbon neutral. Today, Fiji will announce a plan to be carbon negative -- that is, to more than make up for the greenhouse gases released in the creation, transportation and sales of its product. It will also announce goals for using renewable energy, preserving forests and conserving water -- and it will specify how it will attain them. 
 ''Our existence has been a strong net positive for the economy of Fiji, and we don't want to be any less than that on climate change,'' said Thomas Mooney, who in July was named Fiji Water's first senior vice president for sustainable growth. 
 Specifically, the company says it will install a windmill in 2009 to provide energy to its bottling plant in Fiji in the South Pacific; it will ship bottles of water intended for sale on the East Coast to the Port of Philadelphia, rather than truck them east from Los Angeles, as it does now; it will use biodiesel and other alternative fuels in its trucks and as a backup at its plant when the winds are calm; and it will reduce the amount of plastic and paper it uses for bottles and cartons. 
 The Fiji Water Foundation, led by Lynda and Stewart Resnick, Fiji's owners, has also pledged money to protect the Yaqara Valley watershed, the main source of Fiji Water, and to preserve the Sovi Basin, a vast lowland rainforest owned by native Fijians that is home to many plant and animal species.
 ''The Yaqara is important to Fiji Water, but the Sovi Basin is important to all of Fiji,'' said Glenn T. Prickett, a senior vice president of Conservation International, a nonprofit group that has been helping Fiji Water devise and carry out its programs. ''The Fijians are poor people, and without this money, logging would be their only economic alternative.'' 
 Although both projects may reduce greenhouse gases, Mr. Mooney said they were not included in the company's carbon emissions calculations or remediation plans. Fiji Water has promised to buy verified carbon offsets, mainly related to reforestation and renewable energy projects, to cover 120 percent of emissions it cannot eliminate. 
 The announcement comes after a summer in which numerous environmental groups attacked the bottled-water industry for selling an unnecessary product at great environmental cost. Mr. Mooney insists Fiji's plans were in the works long before that, but he conceded that the summer's ''media environment'' prompted Fiji to ''rethink the value'' of publicizing its efforts. 
 ''We are a small brand, but we are raising the bar for the entire industry on how we should operate,'' Mr. Mooney said. ''If we'd announced this six months ago, we'd be solving a problem no one in our industry thought existed.''
 Perhaps unsurprisingly, Fiji's competitors take umbrage with that. Many are selling either purified tap water, which is bottled close to the point of sale, or use many springs as sources, thus reducing transportation miles. Fiji is one of the few that transports its product thousands of miles.
 Indeed, many say that when it comes to setting sustainability goals, Fiji is more of a latecomer than a trendsetter.
 Nestle Waters, a unit of Nestle that sells Perrier, Poland Spring and other spring waters, has already reduced package weight and instituted energy efficiencies and land conservation projects, said Kim E. Jeffery, its chief executive. 
 Coca-Cola, which makes Dasani purified water, has increased recycling and reduced the weight of plastic bottles, instituted numerous energy-efficiency projects and is working with the World Wildlife Fund on projects to conserve seven freshwater river basins. The company has decreased its water use by 6 percent since 2002, said Lisa Manley, director of environmental communications for Coca-Cola, and has pledged to replenish the water it draws in communities in which it operates.
 ''We have committed to grow our business without growing our carbon footprint, and to become truly water neutral,'' said Ms. Manley, who said Coca-Cola would lay out a timetable for meeting its goals next year. 
 Such moves are not winning over all environmentalists, though. 
 ''Bottled water is a business that is fundamentally, inherently and inalterably unconscionable,'' said Michael J. Brune, executive director of the Rainforest Action Network. ''No side deals to protect forests or combat global warming can offset that reality.''
 Mr. Prickett, however, insists that is an unrealistic view. 
 ''Maybe it would be morally preferable to carry a bottle I filled at the tap, but bottled water is a consumer reality,'' he said. ''So rather than operate in a moralistic framework, we'll use the economy as it exists to make a difference.''

HEADLINE: Afghan Struggle to Change Poppy Fields Into Roads

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
OPIUM SEASON 
 A Year on the Afghan Frontier 
 By Joel Hafvenstein 
 The Lyons Press. 337 pages. $24.95. 
 Joel Hafvenstein returned to Afghanistan in late 2004 armed with nothing but good intentions. Employed by Chemonics, a private company with a contract from the United States Agency for International Development, he was part of a team trying to discourage cultivation of the opium poppy by providing an alternative income for poor farmers. 
 Within months the mission was in disarray, its American workers huddled in a fortified bunker after eight of its Afghan employees had been murdered. The next year's poppy harvest would be the largest on record. 
 The sobering dispatches in ''Opium Season,'' a wrenching account of lofty hopes and bitter disappointments, shed a dismal light on American efforts to improve the lot of ordinary Afghans. All over the country development projects are under way aimed at winning over the Afghan people, depriving the Taliban of popular support and propping up Hamid Karzai's government. The obstacles are as steep as the surrounding mountains, as Mr. Hafvenstein discovered and ruefully recounts in this bitter but affectionate book about his three stints in Afghanistan from October 2003 to May 2005.
 In Helmand Province, where Mr. Hafvenstein had his final tour of duty, the immediate plan was simple: hire local people for big public-works projects and put money in their pockets before the government started cutting down profitable poppy fields. This stopgap effort would be the prelude to large-scale infrastructure projects that would lift the local economy permanently. Easier said than done. 
 Getting a multimillion-dollar project up and running plunged Mr. Hafvenstein and his co-workers into a social, political and economic morass that eventually sucked them under. In a country with scant resources, every dollar shifted the local balance of power in unforeseen ways. 
 The influx of international development companies distorted the Afghan economy, driving up the cost of housing and drawing educated Afghans away from vital but poorly paid jobs in, for example, education. Local power brokers, whether government officials or tribal leaders, eyed the Americans askance, worried that their own influence might be diminished. Big landowners schemed to steer benefits in their direction.
 Mr. Hafvenstein arrived eager but unprepared in a region known to the ancient Persians as ''the land of the unruly.'' Racing to set up a project office, he interviewed a long line of Afghans with spotty qualifications and modest expectations. One stated on his application that he looked forward to working in ''a mullet-cultural environment.'' Another, hesitant to accept a job that required him to travel with payroll money, said, ''I would like a job where I will not be killed.'' 
 The security situation was indeed tenuous. Early on Mr. Hafvenstein got a cold dose of reality when the company's security officer rattled off a list of must-buy items for the offices. These included blast film for the windows, razor wires for the walls and a windowless safe room lined with sandbags ''if things get ugly.'' Nevertheless, before safes arrived, Mr. Hafvenstein carried around bricks of American, Afghan and Pakistani currency in the inside pockets of his waistcoat. 
 The cash-for-work program showed progress. Chemonics hired thousands of laborers to do roadwork or dig out the silt from canals in a huge irrigation system built in the 1940s by Morrison-Knudsen, the engineering company that built the Hoover Dam and the San Francisco Bay Bridge. Spurred on by an energetic, idealistic Afghan-American in the office, the company made every effort to extend its reach to remote valleys badly in need of development aid. 
 But the hard realities of the poppy economy quickly reasserted themselves. The local government would plow under the poppy fields belonging to poor farmers just enough to mollify the central government, while powerful landlords paid the police to pass them by. After a particularly heavy rain in Lashkargah, the provincial capital, Mr. Hafvenstein noticed a thriving poppy field directly across the street from the American military outpost, its existence revealed by a collapsed section of earthen wall. 
 Everyone in Helmand, directly or indirectly, depended on poppy income, including top officials. In June 2005 police raided the mansion of Helmand's governor, Sher Muhammad Akhundzada, and found nine metric tons of opium. Mr. Akhundzada, who enjoys close family ties to Mr. Karzai, explained that he had seized the opium from traffickers and was merely waiting for the appropriate moment to dispose of it. 
 Mr. Hafvenstein and his team disturbed the status quo, although they were never clear precisely when or how. When several workers were victimized by a carjacking, informants blamed common thieves, but the act might have been retaliation for giving too many jobs to members of the wrong clan. Later, in the same area, two Afghan workers were ambushed and killed. A party that set out the following day to transport the dead bodies to a cemetery in Kabul was also ambushed and its members executed. One man, an ethnic Hazara (member of the Shiite minority) was shot through the eyes. 
 Local leaders blamed the Taliban. But the killings might have been ordered by poppy growers angry that the American project was depriving them of badly needed labor for the harvest. The police showed little enthusiasm for investigating the matter.
 That was it for Mr. Hafvenstein and his American colleagues. They headed home, sadder and wiser. ''We had come to Helmand thinking of opium as the local currency, and had tried to replace it with cash,'' Mr. Hafvenstein writes. ''But security was the real currency of Afghanistan. The traumatized population of Helmand would trade anything for it, follow anyone who could offer it.'' 
 In a country where violence trumps money every time, the United States, Mr. Hafvenstein suggests, will have to work out a different equation.

HEADLINE: Cuts Urged in China's and India's Energy Growth

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
China's and India's surging fuel consumption poses a growing challenge to the world's energy systems and, unless curbed, will strain global oil trade, push up prices and lead to substantially higher carbon dioxide emissions in coming decades, according to a report by an influential energy organization scheduled for release today.
 In unusually urgent tones, the International Energy Agency, which provides policy advice to industrial nations, urged advanced economies to work with China and India to cut overall growth in energy consumption. 
 Otherwise, the report said, runaway demand in those countries will put heavy pressure on supplies and make it impossible to achieve meaningful reductions in carbon dioxide emissions, the main culprit in global warming.
 ''There is a need for an electroshock,'' said Fatih Birol, the agency's chief economist and the lead author of its flagship publication, The World Energy Outlook. ''We have to act immediately and boldly.''
 Bolstered by speedy economic development and industrialization, energy demand from Asia has been one of the main contributors to higher oil prices. In the last two years, China and India accounted for about 70 percent of the increase in energy demand.
 Strong demand has helped push oil prices to a series of records in recent weeks. Oil settled in New York yesterday at a new high of $96.70 a barrel. Prices are closing in on a record level, adjusted for inflation, of $101.70 a barrel in April 1980. 
 The energy agency sees the next decade as crucial for the stability of the global energy system. Decisions made today in China and India -- for example, whether to continue investment in coal-fired power plants or to adopt policies to tackle global warming -- will have worldwide consequences for decades.
 China's and India's energy use is projected to double from 2005 to 2030. By 2030, the two countries will account for nearly half the increase in global demand. Worldwide, energy consumption is to rise by about 55 percent. 
 China and India argue that it is unfair to blame them for rising energy prices, and they have resisted calls to limit carbon emissions when their economies are trying to catch up with development levels in the West. Energy use per person in those countries remains much lower than in the industrial nations. 
 In its report, the energy agency recognized the legitimate aspirations of China and India to improve the lives of their people. It said, moreover, that solving energy problems is a global responsibility that demands action by all countries. ''China's and India's energy challenges are the world's energy challenges, which call for collective responses,'' it said. 
 China is expected to overtake the United States and become the largest energy consumer soon after 2010, according to the report's forecasts. In India, where more than 400 million people have no access to electricity, energy demand is expected to more than double by 2030. 
 One consequence of that steep growth will be higher carbon dioxide emissions, expected to increase 57 percent over the next 25 years, the agency said. 
 China will overtake the United States to become the world's biggest carbon emitter this year, while India becomes the third-biggest emitter around 2015, according to a preview copy of the report, which this year focuses on those two nations. 
 In the next year, China will need to install 800 gigawatts of power-generating capacity, about as much as Europe has. Its emissions per person will reach those of Europe by 2030, the report found.
 ''This is a very worrying message,'' Mr. Birol said. ''China and India are transforming our energy markets. We have a window of opportunity of 5 to 10 years before it becomes unsustainable and irreversible.''
 The energy agency, based in Paris, was founded in 1974 to provide information and policy advice to industrial nations. It is also in charge of coordinating the emergency response of its 26 members, which include the United States, in the event of an energy crisis.
 As the need for oil imports grows, and supplies level off in many industrial nations, the world will become increasingly reliant on a smaller number of oil-exporting countries, mainly Russia and in the Middle East. As a consequence, the agency said, global energy security will increasingly be at risk.
 China's and India's net oil imports are expected to jump to 19.1 million barrels a day in 2030 from 5.4 million barrels in 2006, more than what the United States and Japan now import. By 2030, global oil demand is expected to reach 116 million barrels a day.
 The use of coal, made attractive by oil and natural gas prices, is expected to rise 73 percent in the next 25 years, mostly because of Chinese and Indian use. The share of natural gas is projected to increase modestly while electricity use doubles. 
 Even if every country adopted economy measures today, the energy agency said carbon emissions would still be 25 percent higher in 2030 than they are now. 
 Cutting carbon emissions in a meaningful way below today's levels would require ''exceptionally quick and vigorous policy action by all countries, and unprecedented technological advances, entailing substantial costs,'' the report said. 
 Tougher efficiency standards for air-conditioners and refrigerators in India and China could, by 2020, save the amount of power produced by the enormous Three Gorges dam of China, the agency's report said. Emissions of local pollutants in both countries, like sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides, would also be reduced sharply by such measures.

HEADLINE: Sidewalks of New York Become Premium Space

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
If you think New York's sidewalks seem more crowded than ever, you may be right: in some areas, there is less sidewalk square footage to go around.
 In part, that is because restaurants are adding outdoor seating areas at a rapid pace, a result of a four-year-old push by the city to encourage more sidewalk cafes. In some cases, cafes are being installed in areas where they have long been allowed; in others, they are being added where they had once been prohibited. 
 At the end of October, 1,069 restaurants either already had sidewalk cafe licenses or were awaiting them, from Harlem to Wall Street and in the boroughs outside Manhattan, too. 
 That total is up more than 25 percent since 2003, when the city's Consumer Affairs Department streamlined the application process and raised its fees. In April 1997, the earliest year on record, there were just 310 sidewalk cafe licenses, the department said.
 At the same time, the city has begun replacing aging bus shelters and newsstands with sleek glass-and-steel equivalents, most larger than the original ones. The policy began in August, with 3,000 shelters and 330 newsstands planned.
 Add ever-multiplying newspaper boxes, bollard posts put up for security after Sept. 11, and extra trash bins and the sidewalks may be the most crowded they have ever been, according to Vanessa Gruen, a director of special projects at the Municipal Art Society of New York, a design watchdog group, who also works closely with its streetscapes committee.
 ''If you look at any old photographs of New York from a few decades ago, you will see that the sidewalks were pretty clear,'' Ms. Gruen said. ''There's definitely a lot more stuff.''
 For restaurants, the privilege of offering alfresco dining has a price. A 150-square-foot sidewalk berth anywhere between 96th Street and Canal Street costs $4,749.29 annually, about $31 a square foot. (Owners also pay a $510 fee for the two-year license.)
 These consent fees, which are the city's going rate for private businesses to lease public real estate, were doubled or tripled in 2003, when the regulations changed. The fees have created a significant revenue stream for the city; it has taken in $10.7 million in cafe fees this year, according to Jonathan Mintz, the consumer affairs commissioner. 
 But restaurants don't seem to be balking at the costs, since cafes are a much cheaper way of increasing capacity than securing a larger indoor space, according to Loren Baron, a broker at CB Richard Ellis who specializes in restaurant leasing. 
 Restaurants typically pay the same rent rate as stores, generally higher those paid for offices and homes. 
 If a restaurant pays $150 a square foot annually for a 2,500-square-foot space along, say, Hudson Street in the West Village, the rent would total $375,000 a year. Adding 500 square feet in a sidewalk cafe would cost $16,000 in annual consent fees, but if the restaurant were to expand its indoor size by 500 square feet, the annual rent cost would be close to $75,000.
 So, Mr. Loren said, the economics favor the sidewalk, even though outdoor cafes are viable for only about nine months a year. That may soon be expanded, however, as the city has decided to start permitting portable gas heaters for outdoor cafes. 
 High-visibility outdoor seating can also serve a useful marketing function, said Stephen Hanson, president of Be Our Guest, which owns 13 New York restaurants, 7 with sidewalk cafes. Mr. Hanson estimates that in his restaurants, cafes have helped to increase the number of customers by as much as 15 percent. 
 His newest restaurant, Primehouse New York, has taken over a 10,000-square-foot space at Park Avenue South and East 27th Street, which was formerly home to a sports-themed restaurant.
 Though the city allows cafes here, the previous tenant did not offer one, but Mr. Hanson will put 10 tables on the East 27th Street side, to open in April.
 One perk of having a sidewalk cafe is that the restaurant's name can be printed on the cloth dividers ringing it, he said.
 ''It gives you a visual lift, almost like advertising,'' Mr. Hanson said.
 A sidewalk cafe provides an advantage, though, only in relatively genteel neighborhoods. A 60-table restaurant owned by Be Our Guest, Vento, at 675 Hudson Street in the heart of the meatpacking district, has 25 more tables outside. A decade ago, when the neighborhood was rougher, the cafe probably would not have been there at all, Mr. Hanson said.
 While adding tables and chairs on the sidewalk can be accomplished fairly inexpensively, some restaurants spend as much as $30,000 adding French doors and railings, according to Steve Wygoda, an architect who said he had worked on more than 250 cafes in the last two years.
 And there are intangible benefits to the public, he added. ''They are beautifying the sidewalk, and where aesthetics are concerned, the public will always benefit,'' said Mr. Wygoda, who is a principal of SWA Architecture, based in Huntington, on Long Island. 
 That New York's sidewalks are now seen as valuable for businesses and the city -- and for residents as well -- comes as a paradox to Paul Steely White, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, an advocacy group that has organized a ''Reclaiming the Sidewalk'' initiative. That is because in the early 20th century, he said, New York viewed its sidewalks as barriers to cars and trimmed them back regularly to allow for wider roads. 
 Now, he suggested, the city should get rid of some of its parking spaces, which are its most undervalued real estate, costing just $1.50 an hour, and put sidewalks in their place.
 Buildings facing those spaces could benefit. ''Sidewalk areas not just a way just to get from A to B, but can almost function as parks,'' Mr. White said, ''and parks drive real estate values.''

HEADLINE: Port Authority Sets Its Sights On Robust List Of Projects

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; David Chen contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For decades, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was a bastion of patronage and a hulking bureaucracy living on its past success in building much of the region's transportation network. 
 After its creation in 1921 and a burst of construction in the 1930s that included the George Washington Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel, the agency largely languished, inheriting politicians past their prime, along with members of their extended families and circles of friends.
 At times, the governors of New York and New Jersey -- who share responsibility for the agency, though their agendas are often competing -- refused to approve substantial investment, and in some cases they tried to pull the agency apart and dilute its sway. But in the aftermath of the destruction of the World Trade Center the headquarters of the Port Authority and its last major construction project, more than 30 years ago, it has at least started to chip away at the nepotism and displayed a renewed vigor in launching projects not seen in decades. 
 With the backing of both governors, Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey and Eliot Spitzer of New York, and of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- three pragmatists who view a healthy Port Authority as a driving economic force for the region -- the agency has taken on a robust agenda, which includes spending $26 billion over 10 years to rebuild and expand its airports, bridges, ports, railways, tunnels and the trade center.
 ''This is the best alignment in leadership we've seen in many years,'' said Martin E. Robins, director of the Alan M. Voorhees Transportation Center at Rutgers University. ''The sky is not falling, but the agency has been underachieving for a number of years and is now poised to do something very significant.''
 The agency does not have the power to tax, so its officials, appointed by the two governors. must rely on bond issues, tolls, fares, fees and leases to finance projects. 
 So far, the agency's checklist includes rebuilding the World Trade Center, helping finance a second rail tunnel under the Hudson River (the first was built a century ago), revamping the moribund PATH system, replacing the Goethals Bridge, giving Kennedy International Airport a major face-lift and linking the region's ports to the freight rail network.
 Last week, another piece of the agenda took shape when the Port Authority took control of Stewart International Airport in New Windsor, N.Y., the agency's first major acquisition in nearly 40 years. The agency wants to expand Stewart, a sleepy regional airport in Orange County, about 65 miles north of mid-Manhattan, as a way to ease congestion at the region's three major airports.
 However, not everyone is pleased to see the agency flexing its muscles, and its ambitious plans are rekindling longstanding suspicions that it is abusing its independence with little regard for the needs of those it is supposed to serve.
 Not surprisingly, commuters and lawmakers pounced on the Port Authority over its plans to raise tolls on its bridges and tunnels by at least one-third next year, the first increase since 2001. Drivers without E-ZPass would pay $8 or $9, up from the current $6, to cross into New York on the George Washington Bridge and in the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels; or to cross to New Jersey from Staten Island on the Goethals and Bayonne Bridges and the Outerbridge Crossing -- which was named after the first chairman of the Port Authority, Eugenius H. Outerbridge.
 ''I can't see, no matter how you slice it, how the motorist is going to gain from a toll hike helping finance other projects,'' said Stephen G. Carrellas, the New Jersey chapter coordinator of the National Motorists Association, a group based in Wisconsin. 
 ''I can't say for a fact that these projects will be more responsive to the needs of those using them, but they seem to be trying to do the right things,'' said Gene Russianoff, the lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a rider advocacy group. ''Like other transit advocates, I hope for the best but I am on guard for the worst.''
 Toll and fare increases are rarely popular, and the governors of New Jersey and New York have often used their veto power to stymie initiatives. But these days, the Port Authority has more political cover. Last week, Governor Corzine -- who has appointed a new leadership team -- all but endorsed the higher tolls and rail fares. 
 ''The cost of maintaining just the operations are substantial,'' he told reporters in Hamilton, N.J. ''I'm sure what Governor Spitzer and I would like to do is keep that cost to the lowest possible level that will allow us to accomplish safe provision of services at the tunnels and bridges and develop the port.''
 The backing of the governors has bolstered the agency's ability to pursue ambitious goals like the Hudson rail tunnel, which is expected to cost about $8 billion; the agency has agreed to contribute $2 billion, in the belief that moving Amtrak and New Jersey Transit passengers more efficiently will spur economic growth and reduce the wear and tear on existing facilities.
 To be sure, many of the agency's steps are more incremental and less glamorous, like establishing high-speed toll lanes at the Outerbridge Crossing in Staten Island. Two lanes have been equipped with devices, mounted to an overhead gantry, that can read an E-ZPass tag in vehicles going 45 miles per hour, instead of the maximum of 25 m.p.h. at other gates.
 In the offices overlooking the bridge's toll plaza, David Boyle, a supervisor, monitored the traffic flow one recent afternoon. In 15 minutes, nearly 300 vehicles streamed through the high-speed gates, twice as many as passed through the other five booths combined. The goal is to eliminate all of its manned tollbooths to reduce bottlenecks. ''The push to go to higher speeds lets us move traffic that much faster,'' said Paul Pittari, general manager of the Port Authority bridge crossings on Staten Island.
 But with the highways and Manhattan becoming increasingly clogged with traffic, the Port Authority is shifting its emphasis from cars, trucks and buses to rail lines. The agency built the AirTrain to run from the Jamaica Long Island Rail Road station to Kennedy Airport and is considering a rail link from Stewart Airport to run along the west side of the Hudson, connect with the Port Jervis line and then come into the city.
 Nor can the authority afford to ignore its original mission, operating and unifying the ports in New York and New Jersey. Those ports' dominance on the East Coast is being challenged by cities like Baltimore and Norfolk. 
 In April, the agency reopened a rail spur on Staten Island that had been shut for 15 years, so containers unloaded at the port at the Howland Hook Marine Terminal could be transported to New Jersey by train instead of being loaded onto trucks. In all, the agency is spending $600 million to improve rail services at all of its ports. 
 Anthony R. Coscia, the chairman of the Port Authority since 2003, said he recognized that the agency's expanded agenda could arouse fears of an unchallenged juggernaut, in the mold of Robert Moses' Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority. For that reason, he said, he and Anthony E. Shorris, the Port Authority's executive director since early this year, helped rewrite its bylaws, for the first time since 1981. Changes include opening all board and committee meetings, to encourage public comment.
 Both men are mindful of what Mr. Shorris calls ''a pretty bad 12 years'' at the agency during the Republican administrations of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Gov. George E. Pataki.
 ''Pataki didn't think of using the Port Authority to promote regional growth,'' said Jameson W. Doig, who reached that conclusion in ''Empire on the Hudson,'' a history of the agency he wrote in 2001. 
 But in the end, it comes down to travelers, whether on the roads, on the rails or in the air. It is a battle that cannot be won.
 ''Criticism of the Port Authority comes from the type of operations they run,'' Mr. Doig said. ''It's almost inevitable there would be some of this. They'd have less of it if they built fewer projects, but they wouldn't get any of the benefits.''

HEADLINE: The Carbon Calculus

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
A CHANGE is in the works that could go a long way toward making alternative energy less alternative, and more attractive to consumers and businesses.
 It's not a technological fix from some solar-cell laboratory in Silicon Valley or wind-turbine researcher in Colorado or the development of some superbug to turn wood waste into ethanol.
 Rather, the change would come from Washington, if Congress does what it has talked about and puts a price tag on greenhouse-gas emissions. Suddenly the carbon content of fuel, or how much carbon dioxide is produced per unit of energy, would be as important as what the fuel costs. In fact, it might largely define what the fuel costs.
 That could shake up the economics of energy, handicapping some fuels and favoring others. Those that produce hefty emissions, like coal and oil, would likely look much worse. And some -- sunlight, wind, uranium, even corn stalks and trash as well as natural gas -- would probably look much better. ''Carbon-negative'' fuels that take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere as they are made, might even become feasible. 
 Carbon dioxide is what economists call an ''externality,'' something that imposes a cost on somebody other than the manufacturer. At some point, the thinking goes, Congress will force industries to pay those costs, either with a tax or a cap-and-trade system in which allowances will cost money. The consensus in the energy business is that lawmakers will come up with a charge that could start at $10 per metric ton or more.
 On Thursday, a Senate subcommittee approved a bill to establish a cap-and-trade system for carbon dioxide, and the Democratic leadership is eager to have the Senate pass it by year's end. But prospects in the House are less certain.
 Still, with all the talk about a carbon charge, ''your perspective shifts,'' said Revis James, an economist at the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit utility consortium in Palo Alto, Calif. ''We're definitely going to be paying a bill here for wanting to reduce these emissions.''
 Some companies are already counting on paying such a bill. In October, NRG, an electric company in Princeton, N.J., made the first application in three decades for permission to build a nuclear power plant. In an interview, the chairman, David Crane, said his calculations showed that such a plant would be cost effective if the price of carbon dioxide emissions ran into ''double digits'' per ton.
 The Electric Power Research Institute's staff estimates the effect of a charge on carbon dioxide emissions on the price of a kilowatt-hour, the amount of electricity needed to run 10 100-watt bulbs for an hour. Natural gas produces 0.84 pounds of carbon dioxide per kilowatt-hour, and coal produces more than twice as much, 1.9 pounds. 
 At $10 per metric ton, the impact is minimal. But at $50 a ton, for example, the cost of a kilowatt-hour produced by coal goes from about 5.7 cents to about 10 cents. Wind power currently isn't competitive, according to the institute's calculation, but it becomes competitive when carbon dioxide costs $25 a ton. By their calculations, nuclear energy, with negligible carbon dioxide emissions, looks sensible at a small carbon charge. 
 Here's how the new economics might work for solar power, according to Charles F. Gay, the vice president and general manager of solar business at Applied Materials, a California semiconductor company that has branched into that field. 
 Solar power from photovoltaic cells is very expensive, about 25 to 30 cents per kilowatt-hour. But compare a kilowatt-hour produced by such cells, which emit no carbon dioxide, with one produced by a conventional coal plant. At $20 or $30 a ton, the 1.9 pounds of carbon dioxide emitted in producing that kilowatt-hour costs 2 to 3 cents. That cuts into coal's price advantage and -- when coupled with progress in reducing the cost of solar power through manufacturing and economies of scale -- gives solar power ''a much larger chance to be relevant,'' Mr. Gay said. Solar thermal systems, which use mirrors to concentrate sunlight to boil water, might benefit even sooner.
 The new calculus of energy would not be limited to electricity. Like a kilowatt-hour, a gallon of ethanol is a commodity. But its impact on the environment depends on how it is made. Ethanol is a prime example of a product with what Lee Schipper, an energy and transportation expert at the World Resources Institute, calls ''closet carbon.'' That is, carbon dioxide embedded in the production of what is supposedly a renewable product.
 For example, Range Fuels, of Denver, plans to open a plant in Soperton, Ga., next year to make ethanol from pine tree waste. About 25 percent of the tree cannot go to a lumber mill or paper mill, the company says, and is usually left behind when the forest is clear-cut. If it is burned, it produces carbon dioxide. If it rots, it produces methane, an even more potent greenhouse gas. 
 Range has a thermochemical method for turning the waste -- bark, cones, treetops, needles and small branches -- into ethanol. Burning ethanol creates carbon dioxide no matter how it was made. But the economics could vary if Range got credit for producing a fuel by using material that was going to turn into a greenhouse gas anyway. 
 In contrast, corn ethanol is made using natural gas or coal that also contains carbon, but could have stayed in the ground if not for the ethanol manufacture. Ethanol advocates say that some gallons of corn ethanol have twice as much closet carbon as others. One new approach to ethanol uses algae; in Arizona, a utility is testing a process to fertilize algae with carbon dioxide captured from an adjacent power plant. The algae can be grown and processed into fuel.
 ''As carbon dioxide fees are imposed, these thing become more and more cost-competitive,'' said Jennifer S. Holmgren, director of renewable energy and chemicals at UOP, a subsidiary of Honeywell that is taking on the project. ''Algae, because of its ability to capture carbon, has a bigger potential than anything else for being carbon neutral.''
 Meanwhile, sugar producers in Brazil are arguing that the ethanol they produce should be able to be imported without the stiff tariffs it now faces. It is made from sugar cane and, they say, requires far less energy to make than corn-based ethanol. Each gallon of sugar-cane ethanol results in 10 percent as much CO2. 
 Some researchers think there could even be products that are carbon negative. Two papers discuss using renewable energy to displace fossil fuel and to remove carbon from the environment.
 One is built on the 80-year-old technology of making liquid motor fuel from a gas consisting of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The Nazis pioneered the technique in the 1930s, making the gas, called ''synthesis gas,'' from coal, and some companies in the United States would like to revive it, again using coal. But the ''synfuel'' has more than a closet full of carbon; it produces about twice as much carbon dioxide per mile driven as ordinary oil does, counting the carbon dioxide released in production. 
 But synthesis gas can also be made from biomass: wood chips, corn stalks or the paper in garbage. Getting synthesis gas that way is carbon neutral, since next year's production will come from new trees or agricultural waste, which gets its carbon from the atmosphere.
 At Princeton, however, Robert H. Williams, a physicist, is pushing carbon negative bioenergy, in which the carbon monoxide is burned for heat to drive the process, but the resulting carbon dioxide is captured chemically, pressurized into a liquid, and pumped underground. 
 If you use plants to make syngas and capture the carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide is not a byproduct but a co-product, he said. 
 The invisible hand of carbon affects even building sites. Michael H. Deane, operations manager for sustainable construction at Turner Construction, said that companies building offices are looking at sites for characteristics that barely mattered before.
 ''You can set a building into a hillside, so you can take advantage of the existing mass of the hillside,'' he said. The ambient temperature of the dirt is 55 degrees, winter and summer, which can help with heating and cooling, he said. And sites are now evaluated for solar orientation and prevailing winds, both of which can heavily affect energy use, he said.
 Carbon dioxide can also be invoked to try to justify other kinds of changes. In October, a San Francisco company, the Wine Group, said that heavy glass bottles took too much energy to make. The lower-carbon way, it said, was plastic bags of wine in cardboard boxes.
 Bottles, the company said, were too vulnerable to ''carbon criticism.''

HEADLINE: Forced to Run Straight, a River Must Now Twist

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

DATELINE: KUSHIRO, Japan 

 BODY:
In the early 1980s, engineers straightened out stretches of the Kushiro River, which had meandered some 100 miles under Hokkaido's big sky here in northern Japan, flowing through green hill country and rural towns, winding through the nation's largest wetland and this port city's downtown before emptying into the Pacific Ocean.
 Later in November, work is to start again. But this time bulldozers will be moving earth to put curves back in a stretch of the river that had been straightened out, restoring its original, sinuous, shape. 
 For decades, Japan pursued economic development at all costs, but it is now emphasizing the importance of protecting the environment. So under a 2003 law that aims to reverse decades of destruction, the Kushiro River will be the first of perhaps many straightened rivers to regain some of its original curves.
 Still, in a country famous for heedlessly paving rural areas in concrete to create jobs and to buttress the half-century rule of the Liberal Democratic Party, some environmentalists and local residents are skeptical of the new projects. With no rivers left to straighten, they say, the authorities nowadays are simply starting to curve them instead. Can politicians and bureaucrats be trusted to repair nature?
 ''Well,'' Kazuaki Saito, 47, a farmer whose land abuts the stretch to be curved, said of the project, ''it's human egotism, and it's for the sake of spending money.''
 Toshihiko Yoshimura, a river planning official with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport here, said the project was endorsed by a committee of officials, experts and citizens, as required by the 2003 law, to avoid wasteful projects.
 ''Naturally, we've received opinions to the effect that this is being done to create jobs,'' Mr. Yoshimura said. ''If we're told that this is not needed, we have no intention of doing it by force.''
 The restoration of rivers and wetlands has become big business in the United States and Europe. In Japan, where the rivers have one of the highest proportions of dams in the world and virtually all have been channelized in one way or another, some saw a great need for restoration.
 But environmentalists, lawyers and some politicians have warned that the restoration effort could become a pretext to finance the same kind of boondoggles that lay behind widespread river straightening in the first place.
 ''Words like 'nature' and 'restoration' resonate emotionally,'' said Kohei Sekikawa, 70, a leader of the Senkon Natural Environment Association, a private group opposing work on the Shibetsu River, north of here. ''But in reality, depending on the place, restoration work could be good in some cases, and it could lead to further environmental destruction in other cases.''
 Even more than other rural regions in Japan, the island of Hokkaido -- thinly populated and mostly agricultural -- has long depended on public works that have often clashed with its natural beauty.
 North of here, in Shiretoko, a small mountainous peninsula that was named a Unesco World Heritage Site in 2005, there are 123 dams on 44 rivers. In the town of Utoro on the peninsula, almost everything about the Pereke River, where salmon swim upstream to spawn, seems to have been made artificially, including a concrete floor, walls and access ramps for the fish.
 Here in Kushiro, the river was channelized when the priority was to develop the area economically. Upriver, stretches were straightened to prevent flooding of potential farmland. Few people gave a second thought to the Kushiro wetland -- currently 5,000 acres that are home to 2,000 species of wildlife, including sea eagles, the red-crowned crane and the huchen, Japan's largest freshwater fish -- just outside this city. In fact, plans called for turning the wetland into an industrial area, though that never happened.
 The straightening upriver made the Kushiro flow more rapidly and carry more sediment downstream. The wetland, which has shrunk by 30 percent in six decades, began drying up, as often happens when rivers are channelized. To try to reverse this, and to prevent sediments from reaching the wetland, a one-mile portion upriver will be refashioned into its original 1.7-mile meandering course at a cost of almost $8 million.
 It is not clear what effect the project will have over all on rehabilitating the wetland, said Mr. Yoshimura, the river planning official. ''For now,'' he said, ''we are doing what we can.''
 But Trust Sarun Kushiro, a private environmental group that was a member of the committee that endorsed the project but voted against it, said that the reshaping would have little positive effect and that the construction itself would harm the environment. Stanching the flow of sediments from farmland and forests upstream, at their source, is more important, it argued.
 And in a case of the left hand's not knowing what the right hand was stirring up, the Ministry of Agriculture had a project farther upriver that was sending mud and sand downstream, where Mr. Yoshimura's ministry is to curve the river, said Takuo Sugisawa, 61, the trust's secretary general. To rehabilitate farmland that had gradually become wetland, the ministry was draining existing land and moving earth there.
 ''The sediments flowing from upriver will quickly pile up where the river will be curved,'' Mr. Sugisawa said, adding that they would eventually bury the Kushiro wetland. To prevent that, workers will eventually have to remove the sediments that are bound to pile up in the recurved stretch, he said.
 ''So in the name of river management alone, they will be able once again to create public works in the form of removing soil,'' he said, walking along an asphalt road and across a bridge built to let trucks and bulldozers move earth for the curving project. ''Public works will just keep going round and round and round.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: November 8, 2007

 CORRECTION:
The Kushiro Journal article yesterday, about efforts in Japan to restore the original curves to rivers that had been straightened in the course of economic development projects misspelled, in some editions, the given name of a farmer who criticized the plan to restore the curves. He is Kazuaki Saito, not Kazukaki.

HEADLINE: On a Greek Isle, Preserving Tradition

BYLINE: By EMILY BADGER

 BODY:
POROS, Greece
 They could have knocked out the doorway and made it wide enough for a garage entrance or tall enough for a boat, or maybe turned the street-front shop into a sitting room, an extension of the home above. But Tatiana Spinari and Spiro Pollalis wanted to keep what they called ''the life of the place,'' a two-story residential-commercial property on the edge of this small island, an hour by ferry from Athens.
 The building has views of the water and, in the distance, the Peloponnesian peninsula. It was built in the early 1800s and owned by the same family until Ms. Spinari and Mr. Pollalis bought it in 2003. At that time, part of the ground floor was still being used for bicycle repair. 
 The couple, both originally from Greece and now American citizens and professors in the Boston area, had no use for a shop. It was the apartment upstairs -- and living on this island of 4,000 people where Mr. Pollalis spent much of his childhood -- that attracted them.
 But what to do about the shop?
 The town of Poros is a traditional Greek village, the kind of place where everyone knows the baker who wakes up each day at 4 a.m. to make fresh amygdaloto, a popular almond cookie. Altering one of the oldest buildings in town -- turning it into a dramatically face-lifted summer home on the water -- seemed wrong to the couple. ''That was the ethical issue,'' said Ms. Spinari, 46.
 Then one day, after several glasses of red wine with a friend in Athens, the solution suddenly seemed obvious. Ms. Spinari would turn the ground floor into an art gallery, the island's first.
 She says the defining element of her family's story is not that she and Mr. Pollalis, 52, are from Greece, with emotional ties to the land and a heightened sensitivity to its tradition. Rather, it is their work.
 Ms. Spinari teaches art history at Boston College; Mr. Pollalis teaches architectural design at Harvard. They moved to the United States in the late '70s for graduate school and never left. Their children, Nikolas, 5, and Kristina, 15, are decidedly American but are just as comfortable on Poros. And Mr. Pollalis is on sabbatical this academic year, so the family will be here full-time until next fall. 
 Their passion for art and architecture -- and, by extension, urban planning -- underlies everything they have done here. They bought the property for 500,000 euros (a little more than $583,000 at the time) and spent about 200,000 euros on a renovation that took a year and a half to complete. The shop space was combined into one large gallery, with polished marble floors and track lighting. The interior of the apartment was altered to add closets and bathrooms: there had been one before, and now there are six. 
 The two spaces total about 200 square meters (2,153 square feet). But the figure is deceptive because it measures the exterior footprint of the building, which has walls nearly two feet thick. Each of the four bedrooms is no larger than 10 square meters (107 square feet). 
 All of the work was done by local artisans, with no real architectural plans. They were guided by their own ideas -- and by Mr. Pollalis's belief that the building could be altered without altering its place in the community. ''That worries me very much,'' he said. ''Because what's going to happen if, say, people from New York or other places in Europe come here and buy all the houses in Poros and then they're never here? It's not the same place anymore.'' A second-home owner has a responsibility in a small town like this one that goes beyond faithfully restoring a property, Mr. Pollalis said.
 The gallery is open three months every summer and has three or four exhibitions during that time, chosen by Ms. Spinari to showcase both Greek art and international influences. This past summer she showcased the artist Stephen Antonakos, whose signature neon pieces have been a draw in New York for 50 years. 
 ''I really want Greece to keep having this authentic aspect, these artisan shops,'' Ms. Spinari said. ''But people have to be aware of what's happening elsewhere. For me, it's important for us to have a dialogue: Greeks, Americans, other Europeans, just to open up a different perspective for people to see, to assimilate in their own way. Maybe they reject it, but at least they've thought about it.''
 Outside influences are strongly evident in Greece. Foreigners now own about 70,000 residences here, according to the government, and most were bought within the last 10 years. Most buyers are either German or English. But Americans, in particular, are just now beginning to overcome long-held perceptions of the country as unsafe, said Vaio Cassimati, manager of the P. Cassimatis Organization, a tourism investment and real estate development company based in Athens.
 The safety issue was emphasized by Harry Coccossis, chief executive of Greece's Tourism Development Company, a government body that manages the country's publicly owned tourism properties. ''Now it's safe from the point of view of personal safety, but also safe from the point of view of investments,'' he said. Greece's stable economy and its place within the European Union have been the primary factors in its rise as a second-home destination, he said. 
 Many of the foreign buyers yet to come to Greece are expected to choose the mixed hotel-condo complexes that are part of the country's tourism master plan. But Mr. Pollalis hopes the rest will share his concerns.
 ''If you want to have a summer house and go to a gated community, or a gated marina,'' he said, ''you can find many places. But if you decide to go to a village like here, or similar other places, you need to be sensitive to give life to the place.''

HEADLINE: Getting a Lower Price, for Repairs You Don't Need

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
In his study of auto-repair shops, Henry Schneider varied what he told the mechanics in one important way. At half of the 40 Connecticut garages where he brought a Subaru station wagon for an inspection, he said that he and his (fictional) wife had just moved to town. At the other half, he said they were about to move to Chicago. 
 And it made a difference -- in one way, at least. 
 At the garages where the mechanics thought he was new to the neighborhood, and therefore a potential long-term customer, he was charged an average of $37.70 for the inspection. At the other garages, he paid $59.75, on average.
 The difference suggests that garages do indeed care about their reputation. With someone who might come back again and again, they wanted to send a signal that they were a good garage. The way they sent that signal was to charge relatively little for an inspection.
 But the quality of the inspection provided by the two different groups of garages did not differ in any noticeable way. The garages that assumed Mr. Schneider could be a long-term customer still diagnosed his car's problems as poorly on average as the other garages. They also suggested unnecessary repairs roughly as often.
 Mr. Schneider concluded that repairs themselves were probably too complicated for an average customer to understand. So the garages didn't try to woo customers with good service. They instead used something simple enough for the average driver to understand: price.
 This idea is consistent with other research that's been done on car-repair shops. Thomas Hubbard, an economist at Northwestern University, has studied emissions inspections done in California, and he found that private businesses that did the inspections were much more likely to give cars a passing grade that state regulators were. 
 A pass or fail, like the bill for an inspection, is simple enough for most of us to understand -- and simple enough to influence where we bring our car in the future. Competent, honest repair work, sadly enough, may be too complicated.

HEADLINE: High-Priced Oil Adds Volatility To Global Scramble for Power

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Reporting was contributed by Ian Austen in Ottawa; Keith Bradsher in Shenzhen, China; Thanassis Cambanis in Dubai; Walter Gibbs in Oslo; Jens Erik Gould in Caracas, Venezuela; Sophia Kishkovsky in Moscow; Sharon LaFraniere in Angola; Heather Timmons in New Delhi; and Julia Werdigier in London.

 BODY:
As the price of oil surges toward a symbolic milestone of $100 a barrel -- hitting $96.70 yesterday -- it is creating new winners and losers across the globe.
 In southern China, high oil prices forced Wang Pui, a trucker, to wait in line 90 minutes the other day to fill up, just to be told he could pump only 25 gallons, as China faced spot shortages of gasoline and diesel fuel.
 When Vladimir V. Putin was making Russia's bid to be host of the 2014 Winter Olympics last July, he reached into the country's deep pockets, bulging with oil profits, and pledged $12 billion to turn a Black Sea summer resort into a winter-sports paradise. Russia, which was nearly bankrupt a decade ago, won the Games.
 The prospect of triple-digit oil prices has redrawn the economic and political map of the world, challenging some old notions of power. Oil-rich nations are enjoying historic gains and opportunities, while major importers -- including China and India, home to a third of the world's population -- confront rising economic and social costs. 
 Managing this new order is fast becoming a central problem of global politics. Countries that need oil are clawing at each other to lock up scarce supplies, and are willing to deal with any government, no matter how unsavory, to do it. 
 In many poor nations with oil, the proceeds are being lost to corruption, depriving these countries of their best hope for development. And oil is fueling gargantuan investment funds run by foreign governments, which some in the West see as a new threat.
 ''Five months ago, readers would not have recognized S.W.F. as meaning sovereign wealth fund,'' said Daniel Yergin, chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, referring to the funds set up by Russia, Norway and others to invest their oil profits. ''And yet now,'' he said, ''they're recognized as one of the fundamental forces of the global economy.''
 The basic calculus of expensive oil still holds: exporters enjoy a windfall and importers bear a heavier burden. But some unexpected countries are reaping benefits, as well as costs, from higher prices. 
 Consider Germany. Although it imports virtually all its oil, it has prospered from extensive trade with a booming Russia and the Middle East. German exports to Russia grew 128 percent from 2001 to 2006; exports to the United States grew just 15 percent. 
 Throughout Europe, the rise of the euro has acted as a hedge against fluctuations in the dollar-denominated oil market, while the heavy taxation of fuel has made rising oil prices less jarring to motorists.
 ''For Europeans,'' said David Fyfe, a senior oil market analyst at the International Energy Agency in Paris, ''$100 oil is mostly symbolic.'' 
 Elsewhere, it is much more. For developing countries, oil can be a tool of national transformation -- whether the goal is a middle-class standard of living or a utopian society.
 In Venezuela, President Hugo Chavez is pouring oil proceeds into a socialist revolution, creating free health care, free education and cheap food; enabling heavy public spending that has helped fuel four years of economic growth.
 The trouble, said Theresa Paiz, a Latin American director for the Fitch ratings agency, is that ''it's not really clear how the money is invested.'' Mr. Chavez's government is steering large chunks of money to development funds and state-owned companies not subject to audits.
 Transparency International, an organization that tracks corruption, ranks countries from least to most corrupt, and in its 2007 index Venezuela was at 162 out of 179 countries.
 Concerns about corruption are even more pronounced in Nigeria and Angola.
 Oil-rich Angola is taking in two and a half times the cash it did three years ago. Hotels in the capital, Luanda, are booked months in advance, largely by foreign oil companies. Sales of luxury cars are booming, and the International Monetary Fund projects the economy will grow 24 percent this year, one of the world's fastest rates. Yet analysts for the Catholic University of Angola's research center say two in three Angolans live on $2 or less a day, the same ratio as in 2002, when the country's decades-long civil war ended.
 The government is eager to show that oil wealth is benefiting ordinary citizens. It has rebuilt 2,400 miles of roads, refurbished 4 airports, and laid 430 miles of new railroad track.
 But many Angolans take it as a given that oil has enriched public officials most of all. In 2003, a newspaper in Luanda identified the 20 richest people in Angola: 12 were government officials; 5 were former officials. Angola's growing muscle -- it is now the biggest oil supplier to China and the sixth biggest to the United States -- is leading it to rethink its global position. It recently joined the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and is limiting its cooperation with the I.M.F.
 In perhaps the most far-reaching change, China has become Angola's financier, lending Luanda as much as $12 billion for the country's reconstruction, in return for guaranteed oil supplies.
 The contest among importers to secure access to oil supplies has become fierce.
 China, a one-time oil exporter that now must import half its oil to lubricate its booming economy, is facing politically troublesome shortages of fuel from Shenzhen to Beijing, as Chinese refining companies refuse to supply diesel at unprofitable state-regulated prices. To head off a crisis, China raised retail prices for fuel nearly 10 percent on Nov. 1.
 India is potentially even more vulnerable than China, some analysts say. Although it consumes a third as much oil as China, it imports 70 percent of its oil. It also has no strategic reserves, and demand is growing faster than in any other economy except China's. Like China, India subsidizes fuel, particularly the kerosene used by lower- and middle-class families for cooking -- a policy that costs it some $12 billion a year. If oil reaches $100 a barrel and stays there, analysts say, India will be forced to roll back those subsidies.
 ''Sooner or later, prices are going to bite,'' said Subir Gokarn, Standard & Poor's chief economist in Asia. ''Clearly household budgets will be significantly affected.''
 Without an increase in retail prices, officials at the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas warned recently, they might no longer be able to buy adequate supplies of crude for India's refineries. ''Unless consumers are paying for what they consume,'' said M. S. Srinivasan, the petroleum secretary, the ministry ''is going to be left with a big hole in its pocket.''
 But raising fuel prices could ignite even greater civil unrest in India than in China, where a man was killed recently after jumping a line to buy gas in the city of Xinyang, in Henan Province.
 Even in developed countries like Canada, rising oil prices can cause dislocation. The region around the oil sands in northern Alberta is the closest thing the developed world has to a 19th-century boom town. The influx of workers has created a shortage of skilled labor in neighboring British Columbia, where construction is under way for the 2010 Winter Olympics. 
 In comparison, the problems faced by other oil producers seem almost benign. For them, the most burning question is what to do with all the money. Norway, the world's 10th-largest oil producer, wants to guarantee every child a subsidized kindergarten spot by the end of 2008.
 It has increased spending on kindergarten to $3.3 billion this year, from $2.75 billion, partly using money transferred from its $350 billion State Pension Fund, once known as the Petroleum Fund. Most of the fund is earmarked to pay the future pensions of Norway's 4.6 million people.
 ''The discipline is structural,'' said Johan Nic Vold, a consultant and former executive at Royal Dutch Shell. ''Without it, the demands on politicians to use the oil revenue would be almost insatiable.''
 Perched on the Persian Gulf, Dubai has taken a similarly long view. Treating its oil reserves as temporary, it used the proceeds to expand pell-mell into tourism, trade, real estate and construction. The oil sector now accounts for only 5 percent of Dubai's gross domestic product.
 But perhaps no country has reveled in its oil wealth like Russia. NetJets Europe, the private-jet company, plans to open an office in Russia because the traffic between Moscow and London has become so dense.
 This month, Christie's will stage what it expects to be a record-setting auction week dedicated to Russian art, including the auction of a Faberge egg made for the Russian royal family. 
 Russians have kept London's high-end real estate market buzzing. ''There are a lot of Russian buyers around who are prepared to pay a vast amount of money,'' said Michael Chetwode of the Home Search Bureau.
 Back home, Russia's oil wealth is trickling down. Mr. Putin is using it to finance ''priority national projects,'' like improved health care and education, and access to affordable housing. 
 Oil may also help Mr. Putin cling to power after he leaves the presidency, perhaps as prime minister. As he noted recently, ''We all remember what state the country was in seven, eight years ago.'' 
 Eight years ago, oil was trading at $16 a barrel.

HEADLINE: In Long Writers' Strike, New York Would Fare Better Than Los Angeles, a Study Says

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
When television and movie writers started walking picket lines in Manhattan and Los Angeles on Monday, their bicoastal protest highlighted the role the two cities play as the hubs of America's arts and entertainment economy.
 More than one-fourth of the people who work in the media and creative arts industries in America are employed in either Manhattan or Los Angeles, according to a federal study released this week. But judging by the figures compiled in the study, a long walkout by the writers would deal a much bigger blow to Los Angeles, which has a heavier concentration of movie and television production than New York. 
 ''The economic impact would be much greater there, as compared to New York, which has a greater diversity of entertainment, arts and creative industries,'' said Michael L. Dolfman, regional commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Manhattan and a co-author of the study. 
 While moviemaking's dominance of the creative arts industries in Los Angeles has continued to grow, New York's economy has remained considerably more diversified, the study found. The study compared employment and wages in 27 selected fields of entertainment, the arts and other creative endeavors in the two cities from 1990 to 2006.
 In both cities, several of the creative arts and media industries added more than 1,000 jobs since 1990, including museums, cable TV programming and Internet publishing and broadcasting.
 The production of movies and videos accounts for more than six of every 10 jobs in the creative arts in Los Angeles, according to the study. In New York, the largest segment -- publishing of magazines and trade journals -- accounts for less than one-quarter of the jobs in the creative industries, it found. 
 Indeed, in New York the makeup of these industries shifted significantly over the 16-year period studied. In 1990, more people were employed in publishing than in any other segment in New York, but television broadcasting provided the most pay -- an average of about $2,275 per week. That was about $1,000 a week more than the average weekly wages of workers in publishing in New York then.
 By 2006, publishing in New York had added about 1,000 jobs, for a total of almost 28,000. The average weekly pay of those jobs had also risen sharply to more than $3,000, while the average pay in TV broadcasting had slightly increased to about $2,450 a week.
 In Los Angeles, the biggest constant has been the importance of the movie-making business. It provided about $2.5 billion in wages last year, or almost 60 percent of all the pay in the creative arts industries there.
 The only other group that accounted for more than 10 percent of the wages earned in the creative arts industries in Los Angeles was agents and managers for celebrities, who collected total pay of more than $470 million last year.
 The report concludes that Hollywood ''dominates the creative arts landscape to such an extent there that no other specific creative industry exerts much economic influence.''
 But Elizabeth Currid, an assistant professor at the University of Southern California who has studied the economic impact of the creative arts in the two cities, disputed that conclusion. 
 ''I would argue that L.A. is a lot more diverse'' than it is given credit for, said Ms. Currid, the author of ''The Warhol Economy: How Fashion, Art and Music Drive New York City'' (Princeton University Press, 2007).
 Ms. Currid said that New York and Los Angeles were co-existing as ''the cultural meccas of the U.S.'' While New York has remained the capital of American high-fashion, Los Angeles has become the hub of sportswear design, she said. And differing styles of rap music in the two cities have fueled a thriving music-production business on both coasts, she added.
 Even the communities of writers have divided by specialty, Ms. Currid said. New York has more writers, but many of them write books and magazine articles, while Los Angeles has a larger share of the screenwriters. 
 ''The writers in New York may be very different writers than the writers in Los Angeles, but I would argue that there's going to be reverberations in both places'' from a prolonged strike, Ms. Currid said.
 Some creative industries, however, have fared very differently in the two cities, according to the report. Employment in theater companies and dinner theaters fell by about 90 percent in Los Angeles, to just about 1,500 jobs in 2006. In New York, theater employment slipped just 6 percent to about 8,500 jobs. Salaries have remained modest on both coasts, with average pay $1,110 a week in New York and $705 a week in Los Angeles.

HEADLINE: Salt Lake City Is Finding A Payoff in Conservation

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

DATELINE: SALT LAKE CITY 

 BODY:
 AS emblems of the economic transformation unfolding in this high desert city and its job-rich suburbs, the Mount Olympus Wilderness and the Black Diamond Equipment company are hard to beat. 
 The wilderness is 25 square miles of steep granite, mountain brush and fir. It spills from the summit of 9,028-foot Mount Olympus down to the eastern edge of this city, which has joined others in the West -- including Denver, Portland, San Francisco and Seattle -- in pursuing a development strategy based on ecological ideas once widely mistrusted here: energy efficiency, resource protection, land conservation and pollution prevention. 
 The base of the mountain is also the home of Black Diamond, a tiny start-up when it arrived in 1991 and now a well-known manufacturer of outdoor gear. The company has taken on the Mount Olympus Wilderness, in effect using it as an outdoor product-testing center. 
 ''We're here because this is such a natural place for our business,'' said Peter Metcalf, the president and chief executive of Black Diamond, which employs 300 people in Salt Lake City. ''But we're no different than other businesses that are in this region. We all understand the connection with this place, how we take care of it, and how well our business performs.'' 
 Residents of this city and its suburbs, with a combined 1.2 million people, have come to view the ties between economic development and environmental conservation in a new way. They are scrubbing the air and water, building energy-efficient homes and offices closer together, constructing regional rapid transit systems, limiting new highway construction and conserving open spaces and natural resources.
 Authorities on urban policy say that Salt Lake and other cities in the West, big Eastern ones like Boston and New York and smaller ones, too, like Grand Rapids, Mich., and Charleston, S.C., have become incubators of environmental ideas and programs, with tangible results. Jobs and income are increasing. Central city populations are stabilizing or growing. Businesses are cropping up. 
 ''Environmental policy has emerged as a central organizing principle of economic growth at the metropolitan level in America,'' said Robert Puentes, a researcher in Washington at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program. ''It's a very new development, and it's logical. Being more energy efficient and more environmentally sensitive lowers costs and makes metropolitan regions better places.''
 It wasn't always this way in Salt Lake City. For more than a century, Utah was supported by the wealth derived from mining, ranching and energy -- industries intent on exploiting, not conserving, the state's natural bounty. Those advocating green values were viewed as a threat to expansion and prosperity.
 But Utah's population, now around 2.5 million, is expected to grow to 5.4 million by 2050. Traffic congestion, the loss of open space to suburban development, and water pollution along the Wasatch Front, where 75 percent of Utah's residents live, have become public concerns. So have the high cost of housing and general anxiety about a deteriorating way of life. 
 These days, advocates for the conventional fixes to growth -- more highways, more malls, more subdivisions ever farther from town centers -- find themselves on the defensive in public hearings. Now there is a different strategy that involves doing more with less: less land, less energy, less asphalt, less spending.
 Examples in the Salt Lake Valley are not hard to find. Kennecott Copper is starting a new community at the foot of its gigantic Bingham open-pit copper mine; it is designed to use less energy and less land and to put its residents closer to schools, stores, offices and recreation. Voters last year approved a sales-tax increase for a light-rail line that will tie the community, named Daybreak, to Salt Lake City.
 But Keith Bartholomew, an assistant professor of planning at the University of Utah's College of Architecture and Planning in Salt Lake City, said the region had a long way to go. ''Our successes mean it's not going to be as bad as it would have been,'' he said. ''But doing less bad is not enough. We need to multiply the successes, and we need to do it fast. The nest we are soiling is not just the environment. It's the economy, too.''
 An example of the half steps Mr. Bartholomew spoke of is a proposed $1 billion, 14-mile freeway, which critics argue will cause more congestion and wreck wetlands along the Great Salt Lake. Two years ago, the state's Department of Transportation settled a lawsuit with suburban residents, and under the agreement, the state will trim the number of lanes, prohibit billboards, protect natural lands, ban trucks, limit speeds to 55 miles per hour, require the state to establish a 2,225-acre nature preserve and restrict development so the highway serves as a scenic parkway. 
 Residents are also voting to spend tax money on alternatives to highways and land conservation. If all goes according to plan, when construction is finished by 2015, the region will have spent roughly $3 billion to build a 45-mile light-rail system and an 88-mile regional commuter-rail network. 
 The two-term mayor of the city, Ross Anderson, a Democrat, has shaped much of Salt Lake City's administration and economic policy around reducing emissions of gases that cause climate change. 
 So far, the city has cut emissions by 36,000 tons annually by taking one small step at a time, like directing every city-owned installation to switch to energy-sipping lightbulbs, saving $33,000 a year.
 ''We've succeeded in completely debunking the speculation that achieving reductions in climate-change gases means economic devastation,'' Mr. Anderson said in an interview. ''Our experience here and in other cities shows that you can achieve very significant cost savings by focusing on efficiencies, and at the same time grow the economy.''
 Of course, like many Western cities, Salt Lake City was poised for growth anyway. Economists and business development authorities cite many factors, including a strong work ethic, good public schools and universities and a history of cultural stability rooted in the Mormon Church. But they also mention the beginnings of an environmental ethic, an update of an old cultural value in the area.
 ''There is a sense of stewardship in this region, and it's been here ever since the pioneers came,'' said Jeff Edwards, the chief executive of the Economic Development Corporation of Utah, a recruitment agency. ''People feel the land is a gift, and they will do what they need to sustain it.''
 In effect, Mayor Anderson and other Salt Lake officials say, green ideas as old as Earth Day are producing healthier metropolitan economies. It makes sense, then, that in Salt Lake City the Mount Olympus Wilderness attracts devotion. And that is where Mr. Metcalf of Black Diamond comes into play.
 Mr. Metcalf embodies a mix of business acumen and environmental advocacy. He is also the vice chairman of the Denver-based Outdoor Industry Association and has brought the industry's two annual trade shows to the Salt Palace. 
 Mr. Metcalf has helped attract nearly 50 outdoor equipment and apparel makers to the region, including Quiksilver, the makers of Rossignol ski equipment, and Backcountry.com, an online retailer.
 ''It's not about being an environmentalist or a conservationist,'' he said. ''I care a lot about that. But it's really about dollars and business. If this place is ruined, this company and others will go.''

HEADLINE: Conservation at the Touch of a Button

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
TALK about remote control.
 The Super Stop & Shop grocery in Long Island City, Queens, is participating in a new system meant to take pressure off the local power grid. In times of peak demand, some of the grocery's lights, air-conditioning and even refrigeration systems can be temporarily shut down -- by a computer in Boston, 200 miles away.
 Nationwide, several thousand businesses like Super Stop & Shop, as well as residential customers, are ceding control of their electrical systems during moments of unusually high demand. And they are being paid to do it. 
 The system, based on a concept called demand response, is one of the latest ways that Internet technology is being applied to improve the management of the nation's taxed power supplies.
 The supporters of demand-response technology say they can save utilities and their customers tens of millions of dollars by selectively curbing demand when the grid is at capacity.
 Once the system is in place, the utility's role is limited to notifying the operators of demand-response systems that it is time to start shutting down the lights remotely.
 ''We tie in to their electrical panel, toggle the relay and curtail 40 percent of their lighting,'' said David Brewster, the president of Enernoc, one of several publicly traded companies in the demand-response business.
 ''We are like an insurance provider for the utility industry,'' he added.
 Enernoc is in Boston, but on a moment's notice it can shut down lights and other appliances in about 1,850 companies nationwide, including some Whole Foods stores, units of AT&T and small local businesses. For instance, when power demands in the Queens area become severe, Enernoc flips the switch on some of the Super Stop & Shop's wall and track lighting and cycles its air-conditioning.
 In Boston, Enernoc has a 5,000-square-foot center that operates around the clock, where teams wait for crisis calls from utilities.
 Enernoc installs a small device near a customer's electrical box. The device collects information on electricity consumed at the site and enables remote access to the company's electrical equipment. 
 An Enernoc competitor, Comverge, provides a similar service focused more on residences. Using a wireless paging system that sends signals to a device connected to a home's air-conditioning system, pool pump or electric water heater, it can govern power use.
 On Aug. 15, for example, ISO New England, the electric grid operator for the region, issued a system emergency because of peak demands created by hot weather. In five minutes, Comverge cut the demand from roughly 60,000 homes in southwestern Connecticut. 
 From January through August this year, Comverge has coordinated 101 such events around the country.
 ''This is going to be mainstream for utilities,'' said Robert Chiste, chief executive of Comverge, which is in East Hanover, N.J., and works with nine large utilities. 
 Industry analysts say these businesses have a lot of potential, but they face challenges, too. The systems must function reliably and not inadvertently shut down power, or leave it down. They could become less economically useful if electricity supplies increase markedly; if the price of gasoline drops sharply; or if they fail to persuade utilities to participate.
 Michael Carboy, a financial analyst for Signal Hill, said demand response on the whole was a good alternative for utilities that must otherwise pay high rates to buy electricity if demand exceeds supply. He said wholesale rates paid by utilities could hit $1,000 or more per megawatt-hour during crisis times, versus $60 during times of ordinary demand. (One megawatt-hour is enough to power a typical home for up to two months.)
 Alternatively, a utility can pay demand-response companies to reduce use. For instance, a utility might pay Comverge $70,000 to $80,000 a year for each megawatt that the company can commit to eliminating from the load. By contrast, if a utility builds a power plant, it could pay $400,000 to $2 million for each new megawatt of capacity, depending on the type of power plant.
 Utilities pay Enernoc about $80,000 per megawatt of saved energy.
 Some of that money goes back to the individual residents or companies participating in the programs. For instance, Comverge pays residents about $35 each summer to take part. Enernoc turns over about half of the fees it collects from utilities to the grocery stores, industrial sites and other companies that enroll.
 The deal has meant about $18,000 a year in payments from Enernoc to Krinos Foods, a maker and distributor of cheeses, peppers, olives, cookies and other Mediterranean foods in Long Island City. When needed, Krinos has agreed to have Enernoc temporarily shut down some of its lights and refrigerators and cycle its air-conditioning.
 During electricity slowdowns, the company has suspended manufacturing lines and moved workers overseeing them to other jobs, like manual packing. John J. Tramontana, a plant manager at Krinos, said the situation had been a financial benefit to the company and had helped stave off broader power failures in the area. It had few downsides, with the possible exception of some grumbling from employees. 
 ''People have gotten uncomfortable with the air-conditioning going down,'' he said.
 Utilities have tried many programs to encourage energy savings, including offering price breaks to large consumers who agree to limit electrical use during peak demand times. But the efforts have been inconsistent.
 Providers of demand-response services, by contrast, aim to become partners of the utilities and a conduit between them and their customers. Enernoc constantly measures the electrical use of the businesses where it has installed a system. That way, it can verify for a utility that it has, in fact, cut use during a crisis.

HEADLINE: Vintage Madeira's Enduring Charms

BYLINE: By ERIC ASIMOV

 BODY:
AS the wine director of the River Cafe in Brooklyn for almost 30 years, Joseph DeLissio has gladly sold vintage Champagnes and old Bordeaux, California cult wines and rare Burgundies. But about five years ago a terrible thing happened: he put some rare old Madeiras on the wine list -- and sold them, too.
 ''If you get to the level where you know Madeira and love Madeira, you hoard them,'' Mr. DeLissio said. ''They are meant for very special, thoughtful moments, and when you see somebody just down a glass, it's hurtful.'' 
 Few wines stimulate the hoarding instinct like old vintage Madeira, the fortified wine produced on a jagged Portuguese island about 300 miles off the Atlantic coast of Africa. Because no other wines age as well as Madeira, it's not uncommon to find bottles from the 19th century, or even the 18th. Not only are they still drinkable, they are in their prime. But very little vintage Madeira is produced, and even less leaves the island that gave the wine its name. 
 Since those painful sales, Mr. DeLissio has stockpiled vintage Madeira, cases of it, from 1978 to 1863. He thinks he has invested $100,000 in old Madeira, $100,000, mind you, belonging to Buzzy O'Keeffe, the River Cafe's owner.
 Though his instinct may be to lock the Madeira cellar, Mr. DeLissio has had to face the economic consequences of his obsession and must do what he most dreads. And so, starting the day after Thanksgiving, the River Cafe will offer 40 to 50 vintage Madeiras, a list outdone in this country only by Bern's Steak House, a wine-lovers' destination in Tampa, Fla. A rotating selection of 10 to 15 of them will be available by the glass, and the rest by the bottle.
 ''Hopefully we won't sell any!'' Mr. DeLissio said, half-jokingly.
 What drives a Madeira fanatic? It's only partly the romance, knowing that a bottle of 1863 Barbeito bual was made the year Gettysburg was fought. 
 But when you pour a glass of the 1863 and it is stunningly fresh and refreshing, with aromas of spices and roasted nuts, caramels and chocolate, and the flavors ricochet through your mouth like beams of light off mirrors, then you want to have a lot more of that Madeira to savor.
 The same is true of a youthful 1969 Blandy's, made from rare terrantez grapes, which tastes brightly of lemon, lime and brown sugar before fading to -- get this -- cream soda. Or of a dry, elegant, perfectly balanced 1929 Barbeito verdelho, smelling of grapefruit and walnuts, changing constantly in the glass.
 ''Madeira is almost like a conversation,'' Mr. DeLissio said. ''It's the most thoughtful wine there is.'' 
 Contrarians must love Madeira, because it turns wine facts on their head. Everybody knows wines must be kept in cool, dark places free of excess vibrations. But Madeiras are purposely heated to more than 100 degrees and were once considered best when subjected to the pitching and rolling of ships on long ocean voyages. In fact, it was in the era of colonization when Madeira's greatness was first recognized, by accident, as legend has it.
 In the early 17th century the island of Madeira was a port for those sailing to Africa, the West Indies and America. Ships would pick up casks of wine for the voyage. One time, the story goes, a cask was somehow misplaced and not discovered until the ship had returned. Amazingly, it was judged to be far better than when it had left. Producers began to send wine on voyages, just for the ride. The best were called vinhos da roda: round-trip wines.
 Ocean voyages are no longer a part of Madeira production, but today barrels of the best wines are placed in the attics of warehouses to bake naturally under the island sun. The heat; the slow, controlled oxidation of long barrel-aging; the high alcohol content, 17 or 18 percent, after fortification with grape spirits; and the searing acidity of the Madeira grapes render the wine practically invulnerable to the ravages of age. Even opened, a bottle can last months without noticeable deterioration.
 Most Madeiras are blends of vintages and grapes. Some can be excellent and more affordable introductions to the pleasures of Madeira, particularly those aged for 5, 10 or 15 years and made with one of the leading noble grapes: sercial, verdelho, bual and malvasia. Sercial is the driest and the lightest of the wines, and malvasia, or malmsey, the richest and the sweetest, though even a malmsey, with its beam of bracing acidity, can sometimes seem dry because it is so refreshing.
 But it is the vintage Madeiras, made in minute quantities, that are the most exciting. By law, these wines must be aged 20 years in barrels, although a new category, colheita, or harvest wines, can be released after five years in barrels. In practice, many vintage Madeiras are aged far more than 20 years. 
 Mannie Berk, head of the Rare Wine Company, a leading Madeira importer, says vintage Madeiras are becoming more expensive. ''Between the dollar and its scarcity,'' Mr. Berk said, ''there's a growing appreciation that these wines are very valuable.''
 While he hasn't completed his list yet, Mr. DeLissio thinks he will charge $40 to $100 for a one-and-a-half to two-ounce glass and $300 to $1,400 for a bottle. Among his treasures are three terrantez Madeiras and an anise-scented 1927 wine made from the bastardo grape, which is now practically extinct on Madeira. 
 Mr. DeLissio says he is still searching for old bottles. For the record, Mr. Berk has a few bottles of a 1720 Madeira, which he says is absolutely ethereal. Not surprisingly, he's not selling.

 SWEEPING his hand across the surface of a warm cask heated by some of the most radioactive material on earth, Walter Heep says he is confident that the contents can be kept safely and securely aboveground for the next few decades.
 Asked what might happen beyond that time frame -- particularly if Swiss voters continue to reject proposals to bury nuclear waste permanently at a deep underground site -- Mr. Heep is blunt about the problems that a lack of such a site will present for the future of the nuclear industry in Switzerland.
 ''We are not planning on a Plan B,'' said Mr. Heep, chief executive of Zwilag, a company that safeguards waste from the country's five reactors in storage buildings here in Wurenlingen, near the border with Germany. ''We need a final repository in Switzerland.''
 Because the production of nuclear energy generates virtually no carbon dioxide, around the world the industry is trying to ride a wave of enthusiasm for green sources of power as demand for energy is surging. But a huge obstacle remains: more than a half century after the opening of the first commercial reactor, there is still no permanent disposal site anywhere for highly radioactive waste of the kind overseen by Mr. Heep. 
 The industry and many governments are seeking to entomb the waste -- the long-delayed Yucca Mountain project in Nevada is the most prominent example -- but aversion to nuclear facilities remains strong, making it hard to find suitable sites and damping the industry's hopes for a nuclear renaissance.
 ''The failure to properly address waste disposal in the first decades of nuclear energy development has left a legacy of doubt in the minds of the public and politicians over its overall safety,'' Tomihiro Taniguchi, the deputy director general for nuclear safety and security at the International Atomic Energy Agency, said at a conference in Bern, Switzerland, in October. ''If this doubt is not ameliorated soon, it could well lead to all the ambitious plans to expand the use of nuclear power on a global scale being significantly delayed.''
 Around the world, waste and spent fuel are stored on an interim basis in pools of water or in casks, many near ground level. That leads to concerns about the vulnerability of the materials to disasters like terrorist attacks, and it raises persistent questions about whether the materials can be effectively monitored for periods that exceed recorded human history many times over.
 Firing neutrons at waste in a process called transmutation can speed up radioactive decay, reducing the amount of time the waste remains dangerous. Reprocessing spent fuel reduces its volume and toxicity. But neither procedure eliminates waste. So international officials like Mr. Taniguchi say permanent disposal in a combination of clay and rock, or in salt domes, is the best long-term option for isolating waste like spent fuel, which contains materials that can take up to a million years to degrade to the extent that the toxicity is negligible.
 Posiva, a waste disposal company owned by Finnish nuclear operators, is digging a tunnel at Olkiluoto, an island in the west of Finland, in anticipation of final approval for storing waste a quarter of a mile underground. Burial could begin in 2020. That could make the site the first of its kind, demonstrating to opponents of nuclear power that long-term disposal is feasible and helping the Finnish nuclear industry save money on storage in future decades.
 But the Finnish case is exceptional. Many residents in the Olkiluoto area accept nuclear facilities because there are already nuclear power plants on the island that provide employment and hefty tax revenue. The local geology also turned out to be favorable. 
 In other parts of the world, similar efforts face seemingly implacable opposition. For decades, United States authorities have sought to put high-level waste inside Yucca Mountain, in Nevada. President Bush gave the green light in 2002, but Nevada's governor vetoed the plan. Although Congress overrode that veto and government officials say they could open a site there by 2017 if all goes according to schedule, few people consider that timetable realistic.
 The prospect of sustained opposition from Nevada has left officials in the federal government hinting at the need to restrict transparency in the future.
 Winning local support is ''a noble objective,'' said Edward F. Sproat, the director of the federal Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.
 But ''if you set your program up so that local acceptance is an absolute necessity to site your repository, I'm not going to say you will fail, but you should be prepared to fail,'' he said.
 In Japan, which generates a third of its electricity at nuclear plants and where authorities are aiming to raise that proportion, the central government is offering up to $17 million each year in subsidies to municipalities that volunteer to be considered as disposal sites.
 In January, Toyo, a rural town in southern Japan, was the first to apply for the subsidies. But some town assembly members and residents, as well as neighboring local governments, protested. The Toyo mayor, Yasuoki Tashima, who backed the project, called an early election to seek endorsement for his plan, but he lost overwhelmingly. His successor promptly withdrew the application, saying that the town had narrowly avoided a ''reckless act.''
 Kenji Ogiwara, a vice minister of economy, trade and industry, said no other municipalities had applied since the election in Toyo. Mr. Ogiwara, who spoke in Bern, also seemed to say that the Japanese government should get tougher by nominating sites rather than waiting for volunteers.
 In France last year, to increase public acceptance after widespread protests in the 1980s against burial, legislators made such plans contingent on the ability of future generations to exhume waste. The law in France -- which relies on nuclear plants for more than 80 percent of its electricity and has one of the largest accumulations of waste in Europe -- was written to allow for other means of disposal if new technology comes along.
 Some experts warn that those requirements make sites more costly to maintain and could undermine the viability of underground storage. 
 ''The idea is that at some point you'll seal the shaft and walk away because you can't guarantee monitoring for hundreds, let alone thousands, of years,'' said Simon Webster, the head of a unit responsible for nuclear fission at the European Commission. ''Leaving a channel of escape into the biosphere could be self-defeating.'' 
 At Zwilag, the interim storage site overseen by Mr. Heep and owned by four Swiss nuclear operators, the temperature of high-level waste inside the casks is about 575 degrees Fahrenheit. But because they are insulated, the casks deliver a steady warmth similar to a household radiator. 
 Openings in the walls of the storage building naturally move fresh air around the casks and through the roof, even during warm weather, removing the heat without spreading radioactivity, Mr. Heep said.
 There is plenty of room for casks at Zwilag, which is not expected to fill up until much later this century. But the industry may need all the space it can get if opponents continue to find ways to stop burials.
 Voters in Nidwalden, a Swiss canton, rebuffed the government in 1995 and 2002 on plans to bury waste there.
 After those setbacks, Switzerland passed legislation that took effect in 2005, depriving cantons of the right to veto plans to bury waste, but allowing for a national vote on the final selection of a site.
 ''We think that's not fair,'' said Jean-Jacques Fasnacht, a doctor who lives in Zurcher Weinland, one of many areas that Swiss authorities are studying as a future waste site. ''We worry that people living in Geneva won't be concerned about what happens in the north of Switzerland.'' 
 Dr. Fasnacht, a co-president of a Swiss antinuclear group, KLAR Schweiz, is joining forces with similar groups in France, Germany and Austria to raise money for studies with the intent of persuading Swiss voters that underground burial will still leave waste vulnerable to attacks by terrorists and to radiation leaks from geological changes.

HEADLINE: Shares Rise on Earnings Reports, in a 'Relief Rally'

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Shares bounded higher yesterday as investors still mindful of widening credit problems nonetheless went in search of bargains in the stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 117 points, with soaring oil and precious metals prices driving up the value of companies that produce those commodities.
 Investors remain troubled by the debt problems at investment banks, notably Citigroup and Merrill Lynch. But companies outside banking, lending and housing have posted strong financial results: yesterday, earnings by Tenet Healthcare, Nortel Networks and Archer Daniels Midland impressed Wall Street. 
 And with no major bad news to follow up Citigroup's announcement on Sunday that it was preparing to mark down $8 billion to $11 billion more of subprime debt, even some bank stocks, pummeled in recent months, looked like bargains.
 Citigroup fell, but JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wachovia, Wells Fargo and Washington Mutual rose.
 Still, in the view of James H. Herrick, manager of equity trading at Robert W. Baird & Company, ''there's room for another shoe to drop.''
 ''I don't think we're out of the woods yet,'' he said. ''It's a classic relief rally.''
 The Dow industrials advanced 117.54 points, or 0.87 percent, to 13,660.94. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 18.10 points, or 1.20 percent, closing at 1,520.27, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 30.00 points, or 1.07 percent, to 2,825.18. The Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization companies advanced 11.34 points, or 1.43 percent, to 801.77.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a margin of nearly 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange on volume of nearly 1.5 billion shares. 
 Bond prices dipped as money flowed back into stocks. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 10/32, to 102 31/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 4.37 percent from 4.33 percent.
 The dollar declined further against the euro, which settled in New York at $1.4554, up from $1.4471 late Monday. Crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled at $96.70 a barrel, up $2.72. Gold futures rose $12.60, to $823.40 an ounce.
 A silver- and gold-mining company, Coeur d'Alene Mines, shot higher on the increased metals prices and a comment by a Bear Stearns analyst, Michael Dudas, that the stock was underpriced. Its shares climbed 52 cents, or 13.5 percent, to $4.36.
 Exxon Mobil, one of the 30 Dow industrial components, was another big gainer, up $2.72, or 3.1 percent, to $90.38.
 Tenet Healthcare, the hospital operator, reported that its third-quarter loss narrowed on higher charges and more admissions in commercial managed care. Its stock rose 72 cents, or more than 22 percent, to $3.95.
 Nortel Networks reported a third-quarter profit despite lower revenue and its best operating margin since 2004. Nortel gained $2.90, or 17.8 percent, to $19.18.
 The agricultural processor Archer Daniels Midland said its fiscal first-quarter profit rose 9 percent as improved results at its oilseed-processing business offset higher corn prices. A.D.M. closed up $2.37, or 6.9 percent, at $36.89.
 Among technology companies, Apple advanced $5.61, or 3 percent, to $191.79, another record close, and shares of Sun Microsystems fell 55 cents, or 9.7 percent, to $5.16, after its profit fell below Wall Street estimates.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of four-week Treasury bills.

HEADLINE: Fix-It Expert Will Lead A New Team at Citigroup

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Citigroup, reeling from its exposure to billions in assets backed by subprime mortgages, has appointed a triage team led by one of Wall Street's best-known fix-it men. 
 The executive, Richard A. Stuckey Jr., who helped dismantle the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998 after its collapse threatened financial markets, will lead a unit responsible for untangling the bank's $43 billion in mortgage-backed securities, the bank said yesterday. 
 The group will try to determine the value of the securities and seek potential buyers for some of the assets.
 Mr. Stuckey, 51, has acquired a reputation as a leader who stays poised under pressure. But his risk-management skills, honed over more than two decades at Salomon Brothers and Citigroup, will be tested by a situation that some analysts say overshadows even that of Long-Term Capital Management. 
 Citigroup plans to write down another $8 billion to $11 billion in subprime-related assets next quarter, potentially flattening its profit while it seeks a chief executive to succeed Charles O. Prince III. 
 ''It's a big task,'' said Thomas Strauss, a former president at Salomon who oversaw Mr. Stuckey's fixed-income shop there. ''It's a very visible task. And it's something that has to get solved.''
 Calls to Mr. Stuckey yesterday were referred to a company spokeswoman, who described him as press-shy. He is currently a managing director in Citigroup's fixed-income currencies and commodities group.
 Mr. Stuckey was appointed in 1998 by Citigroup to a committee that oversaw the bailout of Long-Term Capital, which lost $4.6 billion in its collapse. 
 Members of the committee said yesterday that Mr. Stuckey was a smart, serious and composed worker.
 ''He's a very methodical, calm, cool, collected kind of guy,'' said John Fullerton, who runs an investment firm in Rye, N.Y. ''If there's a lot of pressure on him internally or externally, that's not going to sway what he's doing.''
 David Rogers, who served on the committee while at Goldman Sachs, said the Long-Term Capital project required Mr. Stuckey to conduct delicate work in a high-profile, high-pressure environment -- not unlike his new task at Citigroup.
 ''There were a lot of soft issues to figure out: How would we work with the partners? How would we represent ourselves? How would we represent ourselves to the Street?'' recalled Mr. Rogers, who runs JD Capital Management. ''There were a lot of things other than the risk issues that we had to solve.''
 This project, like that of Long-Term Capital, will require unraveling billions of dollars worth of downgraded assets, but analysts said that Citigroup's subprime woes involve more complex financial instruments and a greater risk to the credit market. 
 Charles W. Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners who has a sell recommendation on Citigroup, noted that the Long-Term Capital collapse occurred in a relatively strong economy. Today, he said, ''there is the possibility that the housing recession will spill over to a broader credit market; you don't have as much room for error.''

HEADLINE: Some at Fed Are Against A Rate Cut In December

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Even if the economy slows sharply in the final quarter of this year, some policy makers at the Federal Reserve are opposed to cutting rates again at their next meeting, in December.
 In an unusually blunt interview, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia said he already expected growth to slow to an annual pace of 1.5 percent or less. But he said he would not support another rate cut unless the slowdown appeared to be even sharper than that.
 Charles I. Plosser, president of the Philadelphia Fed, said he ''would not be surprised'' if fourth-quarter growth was 1 percent to 1.5 percent. ''That's already built into my forecast,'' Mr. Plosser said Monday in his office. ''The key here is that growth would have to be less than the forecast to cut rates again.'' 
 Few other Fed officials have spoken as bluntly as Mr. Plosser, who is considered among the Fed's more hawkish policy makers. Still, analysts say he is not alone in his views.
 ''This is one of the most hawkish committees that I can recall,'' Laurence H. Meyer, vice chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers and a former Fed governor, wrote in a research note to clients. ''The committee is not inclined to ease in December, and it is not convinced that any further easing will be required. However, the market simply refuses to hear it.''
 Mr. Meyer was referring to the prices of federal funds futures, instruments that allow betting on the direction of future rates. Such futures indicated on Tuesday that investors see a 60 percent likelihood of a rate cut in December.
 Mr. Plosser, a former economics professor and dean of the University of Rochester's business school, does not currently hold one of the rotating voting positions on the central bank's policy-making committee. But he participates in deliberations, and his comments reinforce statements by other Fed officials about relying heavily on economic data rather than responding to signs of market turmoil. 
 Mr. Plosser suggested that he disagreed with the Fed's decision to lower the benchmark federal funds rate last week, its second rate cut in two months. ''I happen to think this decision was a close call,'' he said. 
 Mr. Plosser said he had been a strong advocate of the central bank's big rate reduction in September, to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent, but he said he had not seen enough data by last week to justify more action.
 ''My forecast now is about the same as it was in September,'' he said. ''In my view, I thought we'd have more data available in December.''
 Others clearly share Mr. Plosser's perspective. Indeed, last week's Fed rate cut was accompanied by two signs of internal dissent. The presidents of 6 of 12 Federal Reserve banks, including Mr. Plosser in Philadelphia, did not ask for a comparable reduction in the discount rate, which is what banks pay to borrow directly from the Federal Reserve. 
 Many analysts have interpreted the absence of those requests as a tacit signal of concern from those who could not vote last week. 
 In addition, the vote to cut the federal funds rate -- the rate at which banks lend their reserves to one another -- provoked a dissent from the president of the Kansas City Fed, Thomas M. Hoenig.
 Most Fed officials agree that the economy will probably slow significantly. Indeed, the central bank warned when it reduced rates last week that growth in the final quarter of this year would slow from the surprisingly rapid pace of 3.9 percent recorded for the July-September quarter.
 That said, policy makers are far from unanimous. Frederic S. Mishkin, a Fed governor, forcefully defended the central bank's role in cutting rates in order to prevent disruptions in financial markets from causing broader damage to the overall economy.
 ''Quick action is important for the central bank once it realizes that an episode of financial instability has the potential to set off a perverse sequence of events that pose a threat to its core objectives,'' Mr. Mishkin said. Pre-emptive action, he added in language that echoed the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, is a form of ''insurance.''
 But Mr. Mishkin also suggested that the Fed did not need to take additional measures and joined Mr. Plosser in emphasizing that Fed officials were focusing primarily on the economic outlook rather than market turmoil or big write-downs at banks like Citigroup and Merrill Lynch.
 Echoing the Fed's statement from last week, Mr. Mishkin said the risk of slowing growth was roughly ''balanced'' against the risk of rising inflation and that the two rate cuts in August and September ''should help forestall'' a more serious slowdown.
 The Fed's tug of war with Wall Street will ultimately be decided by economic data, which is why many Wall Street analysts are sticking to their positions that the Fed will be forced to cut again. 
 Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist at Goldman Sachs, predicted that the economy was poised for a downturn serious enough to force the Fed's hand -- if not at the December meeting, then by early next year.

HEADLINE: Republicans Join Vote To Override Water Bill Veto

BYLINE: By CARL HULSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats escalated a confrontation with President Bush over federal spending on Tuesday as the House overrode Mr. Bush's veto of a popular water projects measure and approved a $215 billion bill to pay for health, education, labor and veterans programs despite a veto threat.
 The vote on the water measure was 361 to 54, far more than needed to reject the veto. If the Senate follows suit, it will be the first time Mr. Bush has had a veto overturned.
 After a long night of skirmishing on the House floor, 222 Democrats were joined by 47 Republicans in finally approving the $215 billion spending bill. Voting against the measure were 142 Republicans. 
 With an eye to the 2008 elections, Mr. Bush and Congressional Republicans are trying to re-establish the party's faded reputation for fiscal responsibility, while Democrats are working to portray Republicans as being out of touch with the priorities of ordinary Americans. 
 Mr. Bush has threatened to reject several of the already overdue spending bills, and the Office of Management and Budget on Tuesday renewed its opposition to the health and veterans package, saying it included an ''irresponsible and excessive level of spending'' and improperly tied disputed domestic dollars for health, education and labor initiatives to veterans money.
 But Democrats said it was Mr. Bush and his Republican allies who were acting irresponsibly by resisting slight increases to pay for improvements in health care and education while simultaneously seeking nearly $200 billion in new deficit spending this year to pay for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
 ''If the president wants to talk about priorities, let's talk about what is really important to the American people,'' said Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California. ''I'd rather have a war on cancer than fritter away many more dollars in Iraq.''
 The amount in dispute is a relatively modest level of federal money -- $22 billion out of almost $1 trillion in overall discretionary spending, spread across 12 bills. But both sides say the numbers obscure larger issues, such as the recent Republican record on spending matters, the Congressional appetite for pet projects known as earmarks and the coming battle for control of Congress.
 Mr. Bush and Republican leaders are taking a harder line on spending out of a belief that voters in 2006 punished them for allowing federal spending to creep upward in the last six years and creating a costly new Medicare drug benefit. But not all Republicans are toeing that line. On the veto override on Tuesday, 138 Republicans joined 223 Democrats in easily overcoming the president's objections, and all of the annual spending bills have had solid bipartisan support.
 Money for every federal agency is at risk if Mr. Bush and Congress cannot come to terms in the coming weeks. The end result in the worst case could be a shutdown of government services -- an outcome both the administration and Congressional leaders say they are eager to avoid. 
 The government is operating under a stopgap measure that expires Nov. 16. But lawmakers would extend that deadline through Dec. 14 as part of a Pentagon spending measure making its way to the floor. 
 Democrats say the president's unwillingness to yield on spending increases is creating a needless confrontation, a showdown that Representative David R. Obey, the Wisconsin Democrat who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee, this week called a ''manufactured crisis.'' Others agree.
 ''The president is appealing to a very small conservative base of people, his last few friends in the country, to say, 'I am conservative,''' said Senator Patty Murray of Washington, a Democrat involved in mapping the party's spending strategy. ''But the problem is, he is playing with American lives while he sends his message to his friends.''
 In increasingly caustic terms, Mr. Bush has assailed Democratic leaders for their push for more money and as being too slow in getting the required spending bills to the White House.
 ''Considering how eager they are to spend your money, it's shocking it's taken so long to do so,'' Mr. Bush told grocery goods manufacturers last week.
 Democrats have struggled for weeks to fashion a consensus strategy for confronting the president on the spending legislation, and the House and Senate have been at odds over how to proceed. ''There is a lot of confusion up there,'' said Jim Nussle, director of the Office of Management and Budget. ''We are not sure how to deal with them.''
 As a first step, Democrats this week chose to combine the nearly $151 billion measure that pays for a wide variety of health and labor programs -- and which the president has threatened to veto -- with a popular $64 billion veterans measure the president has said he will sign even though it exceeds his limit by $4 billion. 
 The health bill exceeds the president's spending allotment by about $10 billion -- almost half of the amount at issue. But some of those increases are designated for highly popular initiatives like National Institutes of Health research and federally financed community health centers. Those centers, in line for an added $225 million for new and expanded facilities, have been hailed for delivering economical care to the nation's uninsured, with Mr. Bush calling them a ''really good use of taxpayers' money.'' 
 Republicans have objected to merging the health and veterans bills and Senate Republicans said Tuesday that they would use a procedural tool to try to force Democrats to send Mr. Bush the health bill on its own.
 ''There is no reason to put the veterans and our active-duty military and all of their needs that would be met immediately into a bill that has nothing to do with this issue and which the president has given the signal he is going to veto,'' said Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, Republican of Texas.
 Other Republicans say a focus on the overall $22 billion divide is misleading, because the increases, when extended over five years, would amount to $204 billion. ''That throws off the effort to balance the budget and puts pressure on the need to raise taxes,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin. Republicans also intend to highlight earmarks to show the bills contain wasteful spending. Democrats say that Republicans spearheaded the expansion of earmarks when they controlled Congress and that such projects are sought by both sides. They point to a Congressional Research Service report that shows the Republican-led Congress regularly exceeded administration's spending limits when emergency and war money was factored in and that the president never balked. They also said Republicans routinely merged spending bills when they were in charge.
 ''This is not a unique procedure, notwithstanding some of the hand-wringing you will hear,'' said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic majority leader.
 Republicans defended their push to override the public works bill, saying that the water projects had been stalled for years and that each would require another vote before the money was actually spent.
 But some of their colleagues warned they were acting at their political peril. ''The American people long for a Congress and a national government that will embrace fiscal discipline and reform,'' said Representative Mike Pence, Republican of Indiana.

HEADLINE: Trade Deal With Peru Likely to Pass House Vote

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
In a rare show of bipartisan cooperation, President Bush and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appealed Tuesday for passage of a free-trade agreement with Peru in a vote scheduled for Wednesday in the House of Representatives. 
 If approved by the House, the pact could revive the administration's trade agenda and propel faltering trade deals with Panama, Colombia and South Korea, all of which are awaiting Congressional approval. 
 Nearly all 200 Republicans are expected to support the Peru deal, making it possible for the measure to pass with only a small number of Democrats. Some put the number of Democratic votes in favor at 75, and it could go higher. A favorable Senate vote is considered likely. 
 According to administration officials, Mr. Bush is determined to push the trade bills before leaving office, in part because the export sector has lately become the strongest performer of the American economy. 
 The trade deals are aimed at lowering tariff barriers on both sides and increasing the flow of goods and services. Supporters of the deals say they will create jobs, especially in the United States.
 ''Our exports now account for a larger percentage of G.D.P. than at any other time in our history,'' the president said, referring to the gross domestic product, at a White House meeting with leaders from trade associations like the Business Roundtable and companies with considerable export business like Caterpillar, General Mills and Prudential. 
 ''We need to keep the economy growing,'' he said. ''We need to continue to open up markets.''
 Administration economists maintain that no more than 3 percent of the unemployed in the United States lost their jobs because overseas producers have displaced domestic producers.
 But critics of the trade deals say the number is much higher. Leaders of American unions in the textile and automobile industries, and other manufacturing industries, are opposed to the trade deals.
 The Peru deal, involving an estimated $8.8 billion of goods and services a year, would affect only a fraction of a percentage point of total American trade. 
 Colombia and South Korea are more significant trading partners. But the deals with those countries are considered long shots until at least next year. Democrats say those pacts still do not have the votes, in part because of the opposition of organized labor. 
 But the administration hopes that provisions for environmental and labor union protections in the Peru agreement, when added to the Colombia and South Korea deals, could give them momentum among Democrats who are now opposed. 
 Republicans note that under President Alvaro Uribe, Colombia has cracked down on drug trafficking and gang violence, including killings of labor union organizers.
 The pact with Panama is considered a long shot in part because a top legislator in Panama is wanted in connection with the killing of an American soldier.
 Ms. Pelosi, in a speech at a closed meeting of House Democrats on Tuesday, asked for backing for the Peru accord. She told her fellow Democrats that while she had long opposed trade deals under President Bush and President Clinton, this case was different because of the administration's concessions in adding labor and environmental protections.
 She has not endorsed the Colombia accord, citing continuing abuses of labor organizers there. Democrats have said that the deal with South Korea is flawed because it lacks sufficient American access to Korean markets for beef and cars.
 Democrats, who won control of Congress after last year's elections in part by attacking the Bush administration's trade policies, are deeply divided over the issue of free-trade agreements.
 Former Senator John Edwards opposes the Peru deal, Senator Barack Obama has endorsed it and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton has not announced a position but has expressed skepticism about trade deals generally.

HEADLINE: Shy of Publicity but Not of Money

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, Nov. 6 

 BODY:
The United States has more billionaires than any other country: 415 by the last count of Forbes magazine.
 No. 2, and closing fast? China.
 A year ago, there were 15 billionaires in China. Now, there are more than 100, according to the widely watched Hurun Report. Forbes has documented 66.
 Unlike America's rich, China's are hardly famous, even here. Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett are known around the world. But Yang Huiyan and Robin Li? 
 Yet, who they are, and what they decide to do -- or are allowed to do -- with their money and newfound influence will have political and economic consequences in China and probably far beyond, analysts say. 
 ''They could start buying companies in the U.S.,'' Chang Chun, an economist at the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, said. ''They have so much influence.''
 Thanks to the capitalist stock mania sweeping the Communist mainland, Chinese private and state-owned companies issuing stock for the first time are becoming the most valuable companies in the world -- at least on paper -- often overnight.
 On Tuesday, Alibaba.com, one of China's biggest Internet companies, had a blockbuster stock offering, raising nearly as much as Google and soaring 193 percent on its first day of trading.
 That came after the debut on Monday of the state-owned energy company PetroChina on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Its market valuation ran up to more than $1 trillion, topping that of any company in history.
 Analysts are skeptical about the way China's stocks are valued, particularly those like PetroChina with huge amounts of untradable government shares. But on paper it has dethroned Exxon Mobil as the most valuable company in the world. 
 Similarly, China Mobile is the world's most valuable telecommunications company. The state-owned Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, which was nearly insolvent a decade ago, is worth more than Citigroup. 
 And when Country Garden, a southern China real estate company, went public in April, its initial public offering was bigger than Google's. 
 But many analysts argue that there is nothing underlying the skyrocketing values, or that the obscure finances of the companies make it impossible to know their true value. And if China's stock market is a bubble, the new billionaires will disappear as quickly as they rose.
 ''A lot of people are surprised at how fast this has happened,'' said Jing Ulrich, an analyst at JPMorgan. ''But this is the power of the capital markets. A lot of people's wealth is based on newly listed companies.''
 After a nearly decade-long bear market for Chinese stocks, investors here are in party mode. The Shanghai Stock Market is up nearly 400 percent in two years. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is shattering records.
 The emergence of the superwealthy is a dramatic turnaround in a country that once branded enemies of the state ''capitalist roaders.''
 But in the 1980s, Deng Xiaoping broke with Maoist dogma by saying, ''to get rich is glorious,'' setting off a wild scramble that has produced a generation of hungry entrepreneurs.
 Many analysts believe the Chinese are so new to this type of money that they themselves do not know what they will do with it, assuming it lasts.
 As much as the bounty of billionaires is a source of pride, it is also a potential cause for concern in a nominally Communist country. Per capita income in China is less than $1,000 a year.
 ''One issue is social stability,'' says Emmanuel Saez, a professor of economics at the University of California, Berkeley. ''In Latin America you had such a concentration that revolutionaries wanted to redistribute it.''
 Perhaps for that reason, many wealthy Chinese entrepreneurs fight to stay off the rich lists. Plus, the early lists of wealthy often led to unwanted scrutiny, including investigations and jail for some on tax evasion or corruption charges.
 But times have changed. 
 With the economy of China roaring and entrepreneurs sensing a golden age of stock riches, everyone seems to be mouthing the words ''shang shi,'' Chinese for initial public offering. 
 Among the most celebrated are the young Internet tycoons. Robin Li, the 38-year-old founder of Baidu, which is called China's Google, is now worth about $2.4 billion, making him richer than Jerry Yang of Yahoo. Ma Huateng, 36, of Tencent, another Internet giant, is worth $1.9 billion. And Jason N. Jiang, the 34-year-old founder of Focus Media, is worth $1.1 billion.
 Mr. Jiang grew up in Shanghai, and studied literature before turning his focus to business while in college. He says he started out selling advertising in Shanghai and then, in 1997, formed what is now Focus Media with the idea of placing video monitors broadcasting advertisements in elevators, apartment complexes, supermarkets, and even on street corners.
 With the help of Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse, Focus Media went public in 2005 on the Nasdaq -- and its shares have jumped about 800 percent in two years.
 But it may be ambition more than money, at least so far, that motivates him. ''I want this company to be the greatest media group -- the greatest media company in the world,'' he said in an interview. ''I want Focus Media in every part of the world.''
 He says he works 8 a.m. to 2 a.m., and does not feel tired. He also says he has no time for anything else, including spending his enormous wealth. He has upgraded to a nicer home in recent years, he says, but has little time for sports or anything else. He is single and works through lunch at his desk, buying a $2.50 take-out meal nearly every day.
 ''I think this is typical,'' he says of successful entrepreneurs in China. Experts call entrepreneurs like Mr. Jiang the country's best hope for innovation.
 ''These young 30-something-year-old entrepreneurs have become billionaires, and they've become role models for others,'' says Chen Zhiwu, a professor of finance at Yale University. ''They have totally energized Chinese entrepreneurs.''
 In fact, after Forbes and the Hurun Report, which tracks the wealthy, published their rich lists this fall, the government in Hunan Province, Mao's birthplace in central China, seemed to complain that the province was not accurately represented.
 The Hunan provincial government posted its own rich list on its provincial Web site, as if to say: people from Hunan are great entrepreneurs, too.
 While Forbes this year estimates that there are 66 billionaires in China, Rupert Hoogewerf, publisher of The Hurun Report, has already found more than 100, and there could be many more, he says.
 Mr. Hoogewerf also says that 6 of the 10 richest self-made women in the world are from China, including Zhang Yin, the founder of Nine Dragons Paper, which collects recycled paper from the United States and turns it into boxes in China.
 The richest person in China, since last April, is also a woman: Yang Huiyan of Country Garden, the real estate company.
 Ms. Yang, 26, who did not grant an interview, is No. 1 on both rich lists, and easily the richest woman in Asia. A graduate of Ohio State University, she is worth about $16 billion, making her richer than George Soros, Rupert Murdoch and Steven P. Jobs.
 Her father, a real estate developer in southern China, gave her most of the family's fortune in stock, just before Country Garden's blockbuster Hong Kong initial public offering.
 In keeping with their reputation for discretion, of about 15 billionaires contacted recently, only one, Mr. Jiang, agreed to an interview. They tend to hide their billions, friends say, sometimes with offshore purchases. Some even boast that they still get a $2 haircut.
 Their stories, though, are remarkable. Huang Guangyu, 38, grew up in a poor village in southern China, where he and his brother sold plastic bottles and newspapers. Now, he controls Gome, one of the country's most popular electronics stores.
 Li Ning won three gymnastics gold medals at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles. Later, he founded a sporting goods company, took it public and signed Shaquille O'Neal to a sneaker contract. Now, Mr. Li is richer than Tiger Woods.
 The rise of the Chinese billionaire is remarkable not just because of the speed with which it has happened -- the country only opened up to capitalism 25 years ago -- but because it happened without the help of a single global brand, no Sony or Toyota. (Japan has only 24 billionaires.)
 Indeed, China's wealthiest, largely real estate tycoons (35) and manufacturers, appear singularly focused on making it inside China, not outside. 
 That is the next challenge of the billionaires. And some are already embracing it. 
 Shi Zhengrong studied physics and solar energy in Australia before returning to China in 2001 to start up Suntech Power. Six years later, Mr. Shi's solar energy company is valued at $9 billion, its stock price up over 300 percent since the public stock offering in December 2005.
 In an interview earlier this year at his Shanghai headquarters, Mr. Shi insisted that solar power will play a role in China's development. And as he finished the meeting, he smiled and said, ''Some day, this company will be as big as Microsoft.''

HEADLINE: Cisco Reports 37% Increase in Profit

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The network equipment maker Cisco Systems posted a 37 percent rise in quarterly profit yesterday on solid demand from telecom carriers, but its shares fell 9 percent on concerns about its outlook amid economic weakness in the United States. 
 The chief executive, John T. Chambers, told analysts in a conference call that he expected ''dramatic decreases'' in orders from American financial institutions and auto companies.
 Cisco, which makes routers, switches and other equipment, said its fiscal first-quarter profit rose to $2.2 billion, or 35 cents a share, from $1.6 billion, or 26 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.
 Revenue rose 16.7 percent, to $9.6 billion, for the quarter that ended Oct. 27. The company had forecast revenue of $9.45 billion to $9.55 billion. Analysts had forecast revenue of $9.5 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. 
 The stock closed down 4 percent, at $32.75. It fell to $29.82 after the results were released.

HEADLINE: Homeowners Feel the Pinch Of Lost Equity

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

DATELINE: RENO, Nev., Nov. 5 

 BODY:
As his wedding day approached last spring, Marshall Whittey found that his money could not keep pace with the grandiosity of his plans. But rather than scale back, he chose instead, like millions of homeowners across the country, to borrow against the soaring value of his home. 
 He and his bride, Holly Whittey, exchanged vows on the grounds of a sumptuous private estate in the Napa Valley. They spent their honeymoon at a resort in Tahiti.
 But now, in an ominous portent for the national economy, Mr. Whittey has grown tight with his money. His home is worth far less than it was a year ago, and his equity has evaporated. And like many other involuntary adopters of a newly economical lifestyle, he can borrow no more.
 ''It used to be that if I wanted it, I'd just go and buy it and finance it,'' Mr. Whittey, 33, said. ''I'm feeling the crunch, and my spending is down significantly.'' 
 The Whitteys and others like them are at the center of deepening worries that the economy is headed for a substantial slowdown, possibly even a recession, as the artery of cash from Americans borrowing against the value of their homes has sharply narrowed.
 ''Everybody was basically using their house as an A.T.M. machine,'' said Dave Simonsen, a senior vice president for NAI Alliance, an industrial real estate firm in Reno. ''Now they are upside down on their house without that piggy bank to go back to.''
 From 2004 through 2006, Americans pulled about $840 billion a year out of residential real estate, via sales, home equity lines of credit and refinanced mortgages, according to data presented in an updated working paper by James Kennedy, an economist, and Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman. These so-called home equity withdrawals financed as much as $310 billion a year in personal consumption from 2004 to 2006, according to the data.
 But in the first half of this year, equity withdrawals were down 15 percent nationally compared with the average for the last three years, and consumption supported by such funds plunged nearly one-fourth, according to the Kennedy and Greenspan data.
 This summer, the size of withdrawals fell even more sharply to about one-third below the level of late last year, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody'sEconomy.com.
 ''This slide in equity withdrawal is very recent,'' Mr. Zandi said, ''so you wouldn't expect the drop in spending to occur until now, or Christmas.''
 Only a year ago, money taken out of houses was still more than 9 percent of the nation's disposable income, Mr. Zandi calculated, using a sampling of Equifax credit reports to supplement Fed data. By this fall, it had dropped to about 5 percent, a difference of about $350 billion a year.
 Much of the attention in the recent collapse of the housing boom has focused on those in danger of losing their home or facing higher monthly payments in their adjustable mortgages. But the broader effect on the economy is likely to come from the much larger group of homeowners who can no longer count on rising home values to bolster their wealth. 
 Consumer spending accounts for about 70 percent of all economic activity in the United States, or about $9.8 trillion, so even a slight dip in home borrowing takes huge amounts of money out of the flow. The prospect of a slowdown, combined with the squeeze on households from higher oil costs, is sending shivers through the retail world, as apparel merchants, furniture dealers and electronics stores brace for the possibility that the all-important holiday shopping season will disappoint. Automakers are bemoaning sluggish sales.
 ''A fall of 2 percent in consumption would be big enough to trigger a recession,'' said Christian Menegatti, lead analyst for RGE Monitor, a consulting firm in New York.
 Many a premature obituary, of course, has been written for the American consumer -- only to see spending continue apace. Just last week, the Commerce Department announced the economy grew a healthy 3.9 percent during the summer, largely on the back of growing consumer spending.
 Other forces, like increased exports and continued gains in jobs and incomes, may compensate enough for the loss in home borrowing to avoid an economic downturn next year. But many economists say a slowdown in spending is overdue as Americans are forced to curb their appetite for goods to restore balance to an off-kilter global economy. 
 The United States has for years been running huge trade deficits while borrowing heavily from China and Japan. This makes Americans vulnerable to the possibility that foreigners could slow purchases of American debt, sending the dollar plummeting and forcing the Fed to raise interest rates. Some say the best way to avoid such a situation is for Americans to start saving more and spending less. 
 ''If you take the 10-year view,'' cutting consumption is ''the least bad outcome,'' said Robert A. Barbera, chief economist at research firm ITG. 
 In the near term, though, any dip in consumer spending is likely to sow pain. Strong sales for American companies abroad may keep the United States out of a full-fledged recession even if spending slips at home, Mr. Barbera said, but nonetheless ''it will feel like a recession.''
 Sprawled across desert flats and framed by the rugged peaks of the Sierra, Reno encapsulates, in concentrated form, the forces at work on American consumers. In Nevada, and in neighboring California, home equity finance was about 20 percent of all disposable income at the end of last year, according to Economy.com. This September, it was down to about 9 percent.
 While best known for its gambling, Reno has in recent years diversified, using low taxes to entice major companies like Cisco Systems and Microsoft. With land cheap, the area has been a magnet for Californians who sold homes for spectacular gains, then moved here to buy more space for less money. The metropolitan area's population has swelled to 409,000, up 50,000 since 2000. 
 Many of the newcomers settled in developments on the edge of town. Ranch land that less than a decade ago was still a moonscape of sun-baked soil dotted with sagebrush has been transformed into golf courses and Spanish-style houses on streets with names like Painted Vista Drive and Rio Wrangler. 
 Free-flowing credit and rampant speculation drove residential sales. From May 2002 to September 2005, home prices in Reno and the adjacent city of Sparks more than doubled, according to First American LoanPerformance. 
 Since then, however, the median house price has slipped 15 percent. 
 Local businesses are already suffering the effects of consumers who are less inclined to buy. A Volkswagen dealership downtown said sales were down two-thirds from a year ago. At the Flowing Tide, a bar and restaurant in south Reno, the co-owner Justin Moscove said business was down 10 to 15 percent.
 At the Meadowood Mall, near the airport, shoppers were scarce. ''We're dead,'' said Cendy Rodriguez, manager at Lane Bryant, the plus-size women's clothing store, who said business was down 25 percent over the last two months. ''I don't think it's going to be nowhere near the Christmas we had last year.''
 At Sierra Nevada Spas and Billiards, Ezra O'Connor, the sales manager, complained that not even drastically lower prices were attracting shoppers. ''We're way down, 35 percent down from last year,'' Mr. O'Connor said. ''People just aren't wanting to spend.'' 
 Mr. Whittey once seemed an unlikely member of that cohort. A sales manager at a flooring and tile company, he exudes the unflappable air of someone raised amid the easymoney of the casino world. Until recently, he and his wife regularly embarked on shopping sprees of $1,000 and up. 
 He bought a 21-foot boat and two flat-screen televisions for their home. He sold his old truck and bought a new one, he said, ''just 'cause I didn't like the color.'' Mr. Whittey could live in such fashion because his company was making good money and his house was appreciating.
 But today, the value of his own home, which reached $500,000, has fallen and a separate investment property he bought seems likely to fetch far less than the $580,000 he owes the bank. His commissions have diminished, so his income is down. His neighbor recently fell behind on house payments, prompting the bank to foreclose. Anxiety reigns.
 ''We used to go out to eat three or four nights a week,'' Mr. Whittey said. ''Now, we don't go out at all.''
 Even among those who indulged lightly in the credit bonanza, tightness is increasing. 
 Stephanie Lerude, her husband and their two boys have lived for five years in their ranch house on a quiet street in an older part of Reno. Wicker furniture sits on porches, basketball hoops dot driveways and orange leaves crown the tops of cottonwood trees.
 Three years ago, Ms. Lerude and her husband, a lawyer, opened an $80,000 home equity line to invest in three commercial properties. She uses one as the office for her company, which provides gift baskets for real estate offices.
 Their payments are manageable, and their house is worth about $540,000, about $100,000 more than they paid for it. Still, they are limiting purchases and postponing a kitchen renovation because of what they see happening all around them.
 ''I'm just not a big consumer,'' Ms. Lerude said. ''We're trying to do less.''

HEADLINE: Small Businesses Flourishing Despite a Weakened Economy

BYLINE: By BRENT BOWERS

 BODY:
EVEN as oil prices surge, the housing market contracts, Wall Street reels and multibillion-dollar deals falter, small businesses are flourishing and, in fact, are helping to buoy the economy, experts say.
 Last week, for example, a monthly report released jointly by Automatic Data Processing Inc., the nation's largest provider of payroll services, and Macroeconomic Advisers, a St. Louis consulting firm, showed an increase in private sector employment in October of 106,000. That included a surge of 63,000 at businesses with fewer than 50 employees, a gain of 50,000 at businesses with 50 to 499 employees -- and a loss of 7,000 at companies with more than 500 employees. 
 ''I travel a lot and speak to a lot of small business groups,'' said Joel Prakken, chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers. ''What I hear is much more upbeat than what you read in the financial press. Small business owners know about the worries hanging over Wall Street. But they are doing well. Interest rates are low, the stock market is high. They can raise money. The global economy is very strong. They can expand their global reach, and they are doing it.'' 
 The latest numbers marked an acceleration in job growth from an average of 43,000 over the previous three months, Mr. Prakken said. During that time, small businesses were also the main engine of job creation, he added.
 Carl Schramm, an economist who is chief executive of the Kauffman Foundation in Kansas City. Mo., and author of ''The Entrepreneurial Imperative,'' said the figures indicate that the role of small businesses as an engine of job growth is gaining force, especially in troubled economic times. 
 ''In the last recession, young and small businesses created fewer jobs than they do today,'' Mr. Schramm said. ''In the next recession, the power of small businesses to create jobs counter-cyclically will be stronger,'' in part because of the inroads they have made over the last decade into the services sector and the global economy.
 Mr. Prakken said the latest A.D.P. report, the only large-scale national study that breaks down results by company size on a monthly basis, ''answers the burning question of the day: are the housing crisis and the August seizure of the credit markets spilling over into the broader economy? The answer seems to be no.''
 Richard Enos, co-founder and chief executive of StudyPoint, a Boston tutoring company, says he believes he has found a niche neglected by the big companies in the industry. ''We want to build the nation's most successful private in-home tutoring services company,'' he said.
 Mr. Enos said he had just hired two people, bringing his full-time staff to 32, from 23 a year ago, and planned to hire two more soon. 
 He projects revenue growth of 31 percent this year, to $4.2 million, and 66 percent next year, to about $7 million. He said he hoped to expand to 30 or 40 cities, up from 10 today. ''We're really trying to ramp up our growth,'' he said.
 So is Paul Borgman, co-founder and chief executive of the Smoothstone IP Communications Corporation, a business communications services company in Louisville, Ky. He said he had doubled his work force to 100 over the last year and expected to add 40 more employees by this time next year. He said he also planned to open offices in 12 more cities in 2008, up from 7 today. 
 Meantime, he expects revenue to continue doubling every three years. ''Our sales funnel has never been more robust,'' he said. ''The prospects coming into our funnel have never been more dynamic. We see no effects of an economic slowdown.'' 
 Another report released last week suggests some decline in confidence among small-business owners, but it also contained encouraging signs. The Discover Small Business Watch, based on a monthly survey of 1,000 business owners with fewer than five employees, showed modest declines in the percentage who thought economic conditions for their businesses were improving and who planned to increase investments. The survey also found a bigger drop in the number who planned to hire more workers.
 The numbers, though, were ''not as sharp as one might anticipate given the overall gloom'' about the economy today, said Sastry Rachakonda, director of Discover Financial Service's small-business credit card unit, which publishes the poll.
 Moreover, the most important indicator, the portion of respondents who reported cash flow problems, declined to 42 percent, from 46 percent in September, he said. While that was higher than 34 percent a year ago, Mr. Rachakonda said, it showed that the sector was weathering the current economic storms well.
 ''If the cash flow numbers continue in the same trend, the small business economy will be fine,'' he said.
 The latest jobs report from Challenger, Gray & Christmas, an outplacement firm in Chicago, also pointed to a more buoyant economy than headlines about depressed housing and stock declines would seem to augur. 
 The number of planned cuts by employers declined for the second consecutive month in October, to 63,100, from 71,700 in September and 69,200 in October 2006, the survey said.
 ''This is definitely a positive report,'' said John A. Challenger, the firm's chief executive. 
 Similarly, last Friday, the online payroll service SurePayroll released a survey showing that both hiring and salaries at small businesses were up in October.
 One reason small businesses may be outpacing big corporations in the uncertain environment is that they are run by entrepreneurs who are known for their knack of spotting money-making opportunities and acting quickly on them.
 ''We've thrived on a formula for medium-sized enterprises that nobody else has come up with,'' Mr. Borgman, of Smoothstone, said, which he said was to provide and manage customized phone equipment and telecommunications systems for his clients at all their locations.
 ''We save our clients more money than our competitors could, and we save them headaches because we offer a single solution,'' he said. ''This resonates even in this economic environment, when companies' budgets and hiring are not as robust as they were one or two years ago.''
 John-Claude Hallak, vice president for sales and marketing of Hallak Cleaners, an upscale dry cleaner founded by his father, recently spent $250,000 to refurbish his store in Manhattan, $100,000 to upgrade the exterior of his 12,000-square-foot plant in Hackensack, N.J., $60,000 for a Green Earth Cleaning machine and $40,000 to add a truck to his fleet. He plans to invest $100,000 for an automated assembly and bagging system and $100,000 to $500,000 on improvements at his Hackensack building. 
 He said he had expanded service in Manhattan and planned on hiring at least two more people. He foresees steady revenue growth of 10 to 15 percent a year for the rest of this decade, a modest rate, by his reckoning. ''I believe strongly in the tortoise and the hare,'' he said.
 Mr. Hallak pursues an age-old business strategy of aiming at the highest end of the market, which by definition is limited but, he says, is also very loyal. ''For most of the industry, it's a commodities business, very price sensitive,'' he said. Not so for people with $12,000 dresses or $30,000 wedding gowns that need cleaning.
 ''I track everything,'' he said. ''I can tell you every time you had your powder blue suit cleaned and what other items you brought in with it. I can see whether accounts are lapsing and what kind. You can gain all sorts of insights. If the percentage of high-end products weget slips to 50 percent from 60 percent, but overall business increases, that means more people are doing one-stop shopping.''

HEADLINE: Recent Dings Don't Dent Toyota Profit

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Another quarter of higher profit at Toyota, Japan's largest automaker, showed Wednesday that the company's growth remained strong despite soaring global fuel prices and hints of an economic slowdown in its biggest market, the United States. 
 Toyota said Wednesday that net profit from July through September rose 11 percent from the period a year earlier, to 450.9 billion yen (nearly $4 billion). The company benefited from a largely weaker yen, which lowers its prices overseas, and from the popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles like the Camry and the Prius.
 Toyota raised its earnings forecast for the fiscal year ending in March 2008, to 1.7 trillion yen ($15 billion).
 The strong earnings growth was in contrast to the Detroit automakers, which have struggled with labor disputes, declining sales and mounting losses. General Motors posted a record loss Wednesday, after taking a staggering $39 billion write-off.
 Toyota is now neck and neck with G.M. for the status of world's largest automaker. It passed G.M. briefly earlier this year, but the American company has since regained the lead by a slim margin, largely by increasing sales in developing countries.
 Toyota, too, said it made some of its strongest sales gains in relatively new markets like China and Indonesia.
 ''Asia is becoming a new pillar for our profitability,'' Takeshi Suzuki, a senior managing director, told reporters. ''We're growing faster than rivals in emerging markets.'' 
 Mr. Suzuki said Toyota also remained profitable in North America, despite a dip in quarterly sales in the region. 
 Analysts said higher retail gasoline prices might have benefited Toyota by luring buyers to its higher-mileage cars.
 Toyota said quarterly sales declined in its Japanese home market, partly because of production shortages after an earthquake in July temporarily knocked out an important parts supplier.
 Toyota also appears to have been largely unscathed by other problems that some analysts said could threaten its growth. One has been a surging number of vehicle recalls, as the company struggles to keep up with its pace of expansion. Those recalls have hurt the company's sterling image of quality somewhat. Similarly, Toyota's image as a maker of green cars took a drubbing after Toyota joined the Detroit manufacturers in opposing efforts in Congress to raise mileage standards.
 Another problem has been a brain drain of top executives to rival automakers, especially in North America. Still, Toyota, which tends to be conservative in its forecasts, said sales were so strong that it was raising its revenue and vehicle sales projections for the year. The company, based in Toyota City, near Nagoya, now expects to sell 8.93 million vehicles this fiscal year, up from the 8.89 million it projected in May.
 In the most recent quarter, Toyota said its sales rose 11.2 percent, to 6.5 trillion yen ($57.6 billion). It said it sold 2.1 million vehicles worldwide in the quarter, up 4 percent from a year earlier.
 In the six months ended Sept. 30, Toyota said vehicle sales in North America increased 2.3 percent, to 1.5 million units, with notable gains in the sales of the Prius and the Tundra pickup truck.
 The biggest gains came in Asia outside Japan, where vehicle sales rose 18.3 percent, to 452,000 vehicles.

HEADLINE: Need a Life? She'll Arrange One

BYLINE: By DEBORAH SCHOENEMAN

 BODY:
ON a warm autumn afternoon, Allison Storr was giving Brad Peik, a San Francisco real estate investor, a crash course on the Chelsea art world. ''The gallery scene can be a little intimidating,'' Ms. Storr said as she took him on a tour of galleries that was intended as a primer for cocktail party chatter, not collecting. 
 Later that night, Ms. Storr planned to give a dinner party at her downtown penthouse to introduce Mr. Peik, 39, and his girlfriend, Sarah Kehoe, to New Yorkers they might want to socialize with while they figure out whether to make the city a part-time home.
 A week earlier, the couple had moved into a TriBeCa rental that Ms. Storr had found and temporarily furnished, filling it with flowers and groceries. She wrote up a city guide, a combination of her favorite spots and trendy places she thought they should know about, like the Waverly Inn. 
 ''Allison is covering all the bases for me,'' said Mr. Peik, who spends winters in Lake Tahoe in California and feels more comfortable navigating ski slopes than society. ''I didn't want to waste my short time here setting up an apartment and figuring out what we would do here.'' 
 His girlfriend, a photographer, was grateful that she didn't have to deal with the move. ''If I had no job and nothing going on, it would seem reasonable for me to do these things,'' said Ms. Kehoe, who was wearing a boho pink dress from Matta, a downtown boutique, that Ms. Storr's staff stylist, Chloe Garcia Ponce, had helped choose. 
 Looking for someone to curate your life? Need a personal concierge whose expertise is not picking up dry-cleaning but helping chose your wardrobe, your tastes, your friends? Ms. Storr calls herself a personal manager, but her duties go far beyond that. Her clients, all of them men, pay monthly fees of $4,000 to $10,000 to have her be their personal decider in nearly all things lifestyle-related. 
 Calling on assistants including a stylist and a caterer, Ms. Storr helps people figure out their tastes. If they are single, she enhances their social profile (though she insists she is not a matchmaker). She currently works with eight men, she says. (She has had only one female client, who needed help relocating after a divorce.)
 Most of Ms. Storr's clients are single and too preoccupied with work to organize their personal lives, she says. They are either moving to Manhattan or live in the city part-time and covet her contacts, which she uses to link them with interior designers, contractors, art dealers or potential social acquaintances. 
 ''I get people together in a room and let them figure it out for themselves,'' said Ms. Storr, 39, a petite blonde with intense blue eyes who seems constantly happy and curious. ''I help clients expand their social circle by looking at things they are interested in. If I think two people should meet, I might encourage an introduction, but it's an organic process.'' (Marriage is an outside chance. She claims one since opening Allison Storr & Company in 2005.)
 She is helping Dr. W. Scott Harkonen, the president of CoMentis Inc., a biopharmaceutical company, plan a West Coast fund-raiser for Alzheimer's research. Then there's the destination 40th-birthday party in Mexico she is organizing for a client whose business is private equity investing. And the chief executive she's helping to open an art gallery in San Francisco, where she lived for 12 years before moving to New York two years ago. 
 For each person, she draws up a work plan to outline goals, like getting involved in the music scene or making friends in creative fields, which she reviews with her client monthly. ''I help build their plan for their life,'' she said. 
 Every so often, those plans get impulsive, even irrational: she once helped a client move between three apartments in New York in eight weeks.
 Ms. Storr has apparently figured out what many an Internet networking site has not: how to turn various social connections into cash. She insists that she does not take commissions from the galleries, restaurants or hairstylists she sends clients to. Jackie Greenberg, an interior designer whom Ms. Storr recently referred a client to, said, ''Allison collects people and shares them.'' 
 Ms. Storr's ''light-bulb moment,'' when she realized she could turn her skills into a career, came three years ago. A friend asked for help with a theme party for 300 guests. Ms. Storr said she didn't have time. ''He said, 'What if I pay you?' '' Ms. Storr said. ''That launched it.''
 Ms. Storr, educated at Phillips Exeter Academy, the New England prep school, and at U.C.L.A., where she studied economics, business and art history, completed a one-year certificate program in contemporary art at Christie's in London. It's the kind of background many successful men might choose in a wife. But Ms. Storr said she has never dated a client, and she is unattached. ''What I do for my clients are things that I have done for myself my whole life,'' she said. ''I'm not looking to expand my social circle.''
 A partner in a New York law firm, who agreed to be interviewed if he was not named to protect his privacy, said he has employed Ms. Storr for two and a half years. Last summer, Ms. Storr organized an '80s theme party at the lawyer's house in the Hamptons for about 200 of his friends, with a $5,000 budget. ''It was honestly one of the most fun parties out there,'' the lawyer said. ''By now all my friends know that Allison works for me.'' 
 He calls her an outsourced wife. ''The nice thing is that when I ask her to do something, she gets it done and there's no negative feelings.'' 
 Ms. Storr sees nothing particularly sexist about her career. ''For a lot of the guys I work with it's helpful to have a feminine touch to their lives,'' she said. She recently bought her own beach house in Sag Harbor.
 For clients who already have a romantic partner, befriending that significant other is a must. They usually embrace her back, quickly figuring out that she's a good vehicle for promoting their own tastes, particularly in matters of closet space and catering. ''They get their say without having to be overt about it,'' Ms. Storr said.
 ''I trust her judgment,'' Ms. Kehoe, the photographer and girlfriend of Mr. Peik, said. ''Brad will ask me a question like, 'Where should I get a haircut?' and I'll say, 'Ask Allison!' ''
 Asked if all that delegating stifled her own judgment, Ms. Kehoe said she thought of Ms. Storr's services as luxuries that don't detract from her individuality. ''If I picked out a good restaurant or a perfect dress, that's not really a thing I use to value myself, so it doesn't make me feel strange at all to have Allison do those things,'' she said. 
 Mr. Peik said he would feel more comfortable flying from Ms. Storr's warm nest after he knew the city better. ''Once I've lived here for a year,'' he said, ''I'll probably go find a different apartment and discover a lot of things on my own, but Allison got us up to speed really quickly.'' 
 At Ms. Storr's dinner party for the couple, which she paid for herself, about half her 20 guests knew that Mr. Peik and Ms. Kehoe were clients, said Ms. Storr, who had invited mostly what she described as ''hip, cool couples'' and no other clients. 
 The other guests included Raj Roy, the new film curator at the Museum of Modern Art, and Di Ana Pisarri, an actress and relationship coach who lives in the same building as Mr. Peik and Ms. Kehoe.
 As the party wound down, Ms. Kehoe, wearing another dress picked out for her by Ms. Storr's stylist, happily chatted up fellow photographers invited for her benefit. Mr. Peik looked pleased but slightly out of his element, as if observing a diorama of his New York life and trying to figure out where he fit in. ''It's been a really fun night,'' he said. ''It didn't feel forced and didn't seem like we were the reason for Allison having a party.''

HEADLINE: India's Solution for Oil Prices: Ban Speculation by Banning Trading

BYLINE: By HEATHER TIMMONS

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
As oil approaches the $100-a-barrel milestone, M. S. Srinivasan, India's petroleum secretary, has an unorthodox recommendation for cooling overheated prices: halt trading of crude oil on commodity exchanges.
 There are ''no supply constraints right now, and demand has not escalated out of control,'' Mr. Srinivasan said in a recent interview in his New Delhi office. Rather, trading on exchanges like the New York Mercantile Exchange, or Nymex, is contributing ''enormously'' to high prices, he said.
 If crude was eliminated from the commodities traded on Nymex, Mr. Srinivasan predicted, the world would ''see a drastic reduction in the price.'' The benchmark price of crude touched $98.10 on Nymex on Wednesday, a new record, before retreating to $96.37. 
 Mr. Srinivasan's idea is based on a widely held belief that investors are artificially driving up oil prices. Hedge funds, banks and pension funds have poured capital into oil trading in recent years, betting that demand will increase. Analysts say these bets have become self-fulfilling prophecies, helping to push prices higher. 
 What analysts cannot agree on is how much of the increase is attributable to the investors -- estimates vary from $10 a barrel to over $30 a barrel -- and what, if anything, should be done about it. 
 But voices as varied as those of Mohammad Alipour-Jeddi, the head of market analysis for OPEC, and William F. Galvin, the secretary of state in Massachusetts, have blamed speculators for rising prices. ''There is enough crude in the markets,'' Mr. Alipour-Jeddi said Monday. Bottlenecks in refining and ''speculative activities'' are forcing prices higher, he said. 
 Mr. Galvin, meanwhile, is asking the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate what role investors have played in higher prices. 
 A subcommittee of the United States House headed by Representative Bart Stupak, Democrat of Michigan, is investigating commodities trading, and one bill before Congress proposes giving Nymex's regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, more oversight over Nymex's rival, the Intercontinental Exchange. 
 Analysts say the market has gone from a small group of oil users and producers to a full-fledged investment arena in recent years, like stocks or bonds. Prices can move according to intangible factors like fear, just as they do in the equity markets, the analysts say. Investing in oil has also become a hedge against a weak dollar.
 ''Looking at oil supply and demand doesn't help me to understand oil prices'' any longer, said Roger Diwan, a partner with PFC Energy, a consulting company in Washington. ''I need to look at the dollar, at inflation and at credit squeezes.'' 
 India is understandably concerned about high prices. The country imports 70 percent of its crude oil and has few strategic reserves and a deeply divided political landscape. 
 Buying stakes in overseas oil properties is proving much cheaper for India than purchasing crude on the open market. In some areas where India has purchased stakes in oil fields, it is pulling light crude oil -- the kind that sets the benchmark oil price -- out of the ground for less than $40 a barrel, Mr. Srinivasan said.
 But Nymex executives dismiss Mr. Srinivasan's suggestion of halting oil trading. ''Nymex is just a central point where buyers and sellers can come to exchange their wares,'' Richard Schaeffer, the chairman of Nymex, said in a telephone interview. ''We don't make the prices. We make the prices known.'' 
 Without Nymex, Mr. Schaeffer said, users could ''only imagine a group of countries getting together and saying 'What do we charge today?'''
 Despite the risks of ever-rising oil prices, analysts say that Mr. Srinivasan's idea is unlikely to be adopted; the oil market has become too big and too powerful. ''There is no way to put the genie back into the bottle,'' Mr. Diwan said.

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 360 -- Oil Is Pushing Gas Prices

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM and PETER S. GOODMAN; Carter Dougherty in Frankfurt and Vikas Bajaj in New York contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stock markets plummeted and the dollar sank to a record low against the euro yesterday as investors worldwide grew skittish over rising oil prices and the prospect of a substantial economic slowdown in the United States. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 360 points and the broader stock market dropped nearly 3 percent, driven down by fear that the troubles in housing are likely to continue well into next year, contributing to further losses in credit markets and spreading pain to the rest of the economy. After a relatively strong summer, consumer spending is expected to tighten and business profits slow in the months ahead, analysts said. 
 ''We are experiencing among our clients an awakening that the United States is in big trouble,'' said Erik Nielsen, chief Europe economist at Goldman Sachs. 
 The rise in oil prices, which briefly traded yesterday above $98 a barrel before settling at $96.37, now appear to be pushing up the cost of gasoline, heating oil and jet fuel as well. That only intensified concern that American consumers may no longer be able to sustain their spending on other goods and services, particularly the large numbers of gas-guzzling vehicles still being turned out by the Detroit automakers. 
 The most immediate trigger for the sell-off in the dollar, traders said, was a jarring signal that suggested China might shift some of its enormous hoard of foreign currency reserves -- worth more than $1.4 trillion, primarily in dollars and dollar-denominated assets -- into other currencies to get a better return on its money. 
 ''We will favor stronger currencies over weaker ones, and will readjust accordingly,'' Cheng Siwei, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress told a conference in Beijing on Wednesday. A Chinese central bank vice director, Xu Jian, said the dollar was ''losing its status as the world currency,'' according to Bloomberg News. 
 Mr. Cheng later told reporters he was not saying China would buy more euros and dump dollars. But as markets opened across Europe, those words echoed as an invitation to sell the American currency.
 The dollar fell to its lowest level against the Canadian dollar since 1950, the British pound since 1981, and the Swiss franc since 1995. The euro rose to a new record, $1.4729, before retreating. 
 While the reaction to the Chinese statements appeared to have been overblown, analysts said the larger forces assailing the dollar and the stock market were more deep-seated: uncertainty about the magnitude of the mortgage-related credit crisis, and the growing sense that, sooner or later, the unraveling of the American housing market must color the larger economy. 
 Recent weeks have featured a string of unpleasant reckonings for major Wall Street banks, with several slashing billions of dollars from balance sheets to account for losses in the mortgage market. Yet investors fret that there is more pain to come, with no way to know how much or where, given the spider's web of financial deals that propelled the housing boom. 
 ''What it all comes down to beneath the surface is the perception of credit-related problems, and the perception that this is spreading in ways that cannot be anticipated,'' said Alan Ruskin, chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital. 
 Though the losses from the subprime mortgage crisis are frequently estimated at $200 billion, only about half of this money has been accounted for, Mr. Ruskin said, with the markets forced to guess where the next batch of bad holdings will emerge. 
 ''A lot of people do the math and there still seems to be a big hole there,'' he said.
 Amid the carnage, though, there were still several signs that the economy remains healthy. Productivity -- a measure of how much the country produces for each worker -- expanded more than expected in the summer, the Labor Department said, suggesting that the economy still has the ability to grow without stoking too much inflation. 
 But stocks dropped from the opening bell. The Dow closed down 2.64 percent, at 13,300.02. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index tumbled 44.65 points, or 2.9 percent, to 1,475.62. The Nasdaq composite index fell 76.42 points, or 2.7 percent, to 2,748.76.
 The market was also reacting to news from General Motors that it would write down $38.6 billion in future tax benefits after a string of poor sales in North America and Germany, logging its biggest quarterly loss ever. The company's stock price dropped 6.1 percent, to $33.95 a share. 
 The uncertainty about the credit markets pushed financial stocks down nearly 5 percent.
 ''The mood is dreadful,'' said Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist at ING Investment Management. ''People are saying, 'Well, is that all? If they were that wrong about so much, is it possible they're still wrong?'''
 As the economic implications of the mortgage crisis filtered out, the recriminations went on. New York Attorney General Andrew M. Cuomo said he would subpoena records from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-backed lenders, as he continued to look into whether banks had inflated the value of homes. 
 The euro's rise is being propelled by differing approaches to interest rates on opposite sides of the Atlantic. The Federal Reserve has been cutting rates to ease strains on the American economy. The European Central Bank is likely to hold rates steady when it meets today.
 ''There will be a natural flow of money toward countries where interest rates are going to be holding,'' said Stuart A. Schweitzer, managing director of global markets at JPMorgan Asset and Wealth Management. 
 For Americans, the ramifications of a weak dollar are varied. World travelers feel the pinch as the price of European hotels and restaurants soar in dollar terms. At home, the prices of imported goods like German-made cars and French wine inch up. Some fret that a further weakening in the dollar could sow inflation, as the impact of higher-priced imports -- oil in particular -- filters through the economy. 
 Indeed, some now see the dollar and the price of oil as intertwined: As the value of the currency falls, sellers of oil demand more dollars for the same barrel. And as oil prices climb, this impedes American growth, making the dollar less attractive. 
 Many see a weaker dollar as an unavoidable means of shrinking the United States trade deficit, which last year exceeded $800 billion. A weaker dollar helps make American goods cheaper on world markets. 
 Exports have been surging, giving companies in the United States a source of growing profits as sales soften at home.
 ''We're in an unsustainable situation in terms of accumulating enormous deficits,'' said Clyde Prestowitz, a former trade negotiator in the Reagan administration, and now president of the Economic Strategy Institute. ''The only way out of that is through a weaker dollar.'' 
 Still, some say fears about a flight from the dollar are exaggerated; China and Japan depend on the purchasing power of Americans for their exports. They, along with the oil producers, hold so many dollars that they are loath to do anything to cause a precipitous fall. 
 But investors keep worrying about another surprise.
 ''You've basically got capital market jitters about the United States,'' said William R. Cline, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.

HEADLINE: Unseasonably Higher, Gas Prices Add to Strain On U.S. Consumers

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Christopher Maag contributed reporting from Ohio.

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Most years, the shorter days and lower temperatures of autumn mean falling gasoline prices, as demand eases from the busy summer travel season.
 But this year, high oil prices are upsetting that seasonal rhythm. Prices at the pump are climbing fast, bringing back memories of summertime gasoline bills.
 The national average for regular gas surpassed $3 a gallon this week, and drivers could be paying record prices this holiday season, experts said. The timing of such an unusual jump could crimp consumer spending at a vital time for retailers. 
 ''Usually Americans have more money to spend each holiday season because gasoline prices tend to give up 25 percent of their value after summer,'' said Tom Kloza, an analyst with the Oil Price Information Service. ''But this year there is a second coming of the gasoline rally that may be the Grinch that stole Christmas.''
 Barring some unexpected development like a big drop in the price of oil, Mr. Kloza and other experts said, gas could be headed toward $4 a gallon by spring. Gasoline prices have trailed surging oil prices, but they are starting to catch up as crude oil nears $100 a barrel. Oil settled down slightly yesterday, at $96.37 a barrel.
 On Wednesday the national average gas price for unleaded regular reached $3.04 -- an increase of nearly 28 cents in the last month, according to AAA, the automobile club. Average gasoline prices in November had never exceeded $3 a gallon before this year. A year ago, the average price at the pump was $2.20, meaning it costs roughly $12.50 more today to fill a car with a 15-gallon tank.
 In some states the average price motorists are paying is much higher. In California, for example, the price on Wednesday averaged $3.31. 
 For now, prices are well below the record of $3.23 a gallon, set during a spike last May. But recently they have been rising by 2 cents a gallon every day. Motorists are feeling the pain across the nation.
 Jim Lunn, 48, wore a sweatshirt bearing the name of his favorite football team, the Cleveland Browns, as he filled the tank of his red Dodge pickup this week at a station in Avon Lake, Ohio. He said he liked going to games, but these days, he often stays home on game day.
 ''With gas prices being what they are, I can't afford to drive all the way downtown,'' he said. ''So I just watch the games at home. It's nowhere near as fun.''
 If gasoline prices are causing motorists to drive less over all, it is not evident in the national statistics. Americans have consumed an average of 9.3 million barrels of gasoline a day so far this year, an increase of 0.6 percent from last year, according to the Energy Department.
 One reason many consumers have shaken off the gasoline price increase may be that gasoline expenditures claim less than 4 percent of after-tax personal income today, compared with more than 6 percent in 1981 when gasoline prices were also high, according to a recent study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.
 But there are signs that many Americans are feeling the pinch, and business economists are worried that rising gasoline prices will cut consumer spending this holiday season.
 Michael P. Niemira, chief economist for the International Council of Shopping Centers, said that average weekly earnings of American households over the last year have outpaced increased expenditures for gasoline. But he added, ''With the expectations of higher gasoline prices and home heating expenses this winter, the potential exists that consumers will have less discretionary purchasing power.'' 
 He noted that over the last couple of years consumers have been consolidating their shopping trips to save on gas. Meanwhile, lower-income drivers are especially unhappy with prices at the pump.
 At a gas station in Norwalk, Ohio, where gasoline was selling on Tuesday for $3.09, drivers said the cost was crimping their lives.
 ''Generally, I go out less now,'' said Janet LaVigne, 51, who fills her 1994 Mazda Protege daily to deliver newspapers in communities outside Cleveland. ''I do my job and come home. I used to go out to the movies, sometimes to restaurants, but now I can't afford the gas.''
 Sara Scheerer, a 17-year-old high school senior, said the high cost of fueling her 1999 Ford Explorer to drive to basketball team practices and school had forced her to get a salesclerk job at Walgreens. ''I can't spend as much money on other stuff like clothes,'' she added.
 Energy experts see few signs that gasoline prices will ease soon. 
 Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman for AAA, projected that average regular gasoline prices nationwide would be at least $3.20 by Christmas. Amanda Kurzendoerfer, a commodities analyst at Summit Energy Services Inc., an energy manager for large users of oil and natural gas, predicted a price as high as $3.50 by Christmas -- which would be a record for any time of year.
 ''If you look at gasoline prices relative to oil, it's low right now,'' she said. ''Oil fundamentals are tight and tightening through the end of the year, demand has continued to be strong, non-OPEC supply is not keeping up and OPEC appears to not be eager to boost production.'' She was referring to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, the oil cartel.
 Ms. Kurzendoerfer predicts that while oil prices could exceed $100 a barrel in the near term, they will average $75 to $80 in 2008. Still, she said gasoline prices would most likely be higher in the spring when refiners have to produce more expensive blends for warmer weather and the heavy summer driving season begins.
 William R. Veno, an expert on gasoline at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an energy consulting firm, also projects lower crude prices next year. But he warned that gasoline inventories could drop in the coming months as refiners expect to produce more profitable heating oil for the winter, leading to further pressure on gasoline prices. 
 ''We could enter the springtime with unusually low inventories,'' he said, ''which would add further to very high gasoline prices in the spring.''

HEADLINE: Don't Throw Out Your Broken iPod; Fix It Via the Web

BYLINE: By PETER WAYNER

 BODY:
A FEW months ago, Stephen Ironside, a student at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, confronted a minor but modern tragedy: the iPod that filled his life with song stopped working.
 The device was out of warranty, and Apple would not fix it free. So he left it in a drawer until he happened to read a blog posting on CrunchGear.com that described how he might fix it -- with a small, folded piece of paper. Mr. Ironside celebrated by posting thanks on the blog: ''I've been on CDs for months. You saved my life (and my iPod).'' 
 The author of the blog post, Matt Hickey of Seattle, says that using paper as a shim to put pressure on the hard drive has worked on about 70 percent of the failed iPods he has encountered -- even though he is not sure why it works.
 Gadget-fixing is adapting to the modern era. Neighborhood repair shops are all but gone, and along with them the repairmen who could offer casual advice, even when that advice was whether it was worth repairing the device. But Web sites can help users find and share solutions that can save a device from the landfill. If the job is too tricky, a number of Internet-based firms offer highly specialized repairs via overnight mail. 
 Some sites like macfixit.com, fixmyxp.com and macosxhints.com are devoted to a single product, while others like avsforum.com sponsor debates on a big product area, in this case home theaters, televisions and stereos. People with laptops that have suddenly gone blank can turn to www.notebookforums.com or notebookreview.com, and there are even a few sites like www.highdefforum.com for fixing TVs.
 Yaniv Bensadon, the chief executive of fixya.com, started his site after he moved back to Israel from the United States and found that his electronics would often malfunction in the new environment. The manuals and the support offered by the manufacturers rarely helped.
 His site groups questions and answers to problems and organizes them according to product type, brand name and model number. The page for the Microsoft Xbox 360, for instance, lists more than 100 questions with answers. Most provide a single solution, but one common problem, overheating, has 81 posts debating the best fix. All but about a dozen of the questions had answers, although some were a bit brief. (Microsoft has offered to fix those overheating Xbox 360s).
 ''Like any other consumer out there, I had problems with my Xerox printer, Palm Treo 700, Belkin wireless router and even Sony portable DVD,'' Mr. Bensadon said. ''On each of the problems I posted, I received a great solution within 5 to 10 hours.''
 Fixya rates the people who offer advice. Anyone can claim to be an expert on a topic, but their rating will rise or fall with the quality of their answers. The site also offers paid services from users who charge about $10 to $20 a problem.
 Knowledge is only half of the battle. A number of sites specialize in providing spare parts but also provide the information on how to install them as the incentive to use the site. PDAparts.com, for instance, sells replacement screens, batteries, cases and other parts for Palm Treos, iPaqs and other P.D.A.'s. Videos describing the process of opening the cases -- probably the trickiest part of repairing today's electronics -- can be downloaded from the site.
 Most other gadgets come with batteries that are easy to replace without custom tools. Replacement batteries for cellphones are often marked up by the devices' manufacturers, while third-party replacements are often available for 60 percent to 80 percent less. Companies offering replacement batteries for iPods often offer better batteries with higher capacities and longer lifetimes. Ipodjuice.com, for instance, sells a 1,200-milliamp-hour battery that will replace the 600-milliamp-hour battery that shipped with a fourth-generation iPod -- an improvement that lets the Web site claim that the repaired iPod will ''last 100 percent longer.''
 Most replacement kits include small tools for popping open iPods and video instructions for swapping batteries. 
 For those who do not want to get their hands dirty or wait for an answer, dozens of businesses specialize in fixing some of the most common problems. Ryan Arter, the president of IResQ.com, said his company has been fixing Apple products since 1994. Today, hundreds of iPod, iPhone and iBook owners send their broken machines by overnight mail to his shop in Olathe, Kan., where technicians repair them.
 Prices depend on the item and the damage. Replacing a screen on a fourth-generation iPod, for instance, costs $94 for parts, labor and overnight shipping in both directions. Replacing the battery on an iPhone costs $79.
 You can take the device to an Apple store for a new battery, and it will cost only $65. But you may not get the same device back, a concern if the gadget is personalized.
 ''They're definitely worth repairing,'' Mr. Arter said. ''Sometimes they're engraved and they have some special meaning.
 ''Are they disposable?'' he said. ''No. They're little computers. They're a big investment.'' But he says that it makes little sense to fix a device if there are two or three problems with it.
 Shannon Jean, the founder of TechRestore.com, a competitor in Concord, Calif., says that the data on a device can be more valuable than the gadget itself. An iPod or a laptop may carry thousands of dollars worth of music and a immeasurable amount of documents, spreadsheets or other information. 
 ''When there's data involved, that defines what people will pay, especially when there's downtime involved,'' he said.
 Among the sites offering help with repairs, it is hard to find one that tells you whether it makes economic sense to pay for the repairs. But some decisions are easy. Basic DVD players are usually cheaper to replace. So are PCs with outdated operating systems like Windows 95. For everything else, especially when a new device costs less the one you bought, the choice is harder. Is it wise to pay $80 to repair a $300 digital camera that now costs $100? Unlikely.
 Deciding between repairing a gadget or replacing it with a newer, often better model is a bit of a gamble. Most sites caution that they cannot fix every problem. Some problems like a cracked screen can be easy to estimate and straightforward to repair. Random glitches and odd behavior, however, may be impossible to pinpoint, leaving the user with a bill for ineffective repairs.
 Chris Adamson, an editor at O'Reilly Media in Sebastopol, Calif., offers a cautionary tale. He shipped a faulty iPod that was failing on planes to an online company, which he does not want to mention by name. It took a week for the service to diagnose the problem before suggesting replacing the hard disk for $120. The solution, however, did not address the basic problem, and he now finds himself asking for a refund, which the company does not want to give.
 He recommends thinking of the devices as having a short life span, perhaps three or four years. ''If it fails after that period, accept that you've gotten your value out of it and get something new,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Militant Group Is Out of Baghdad, U.S. General Says

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Reporting was contributed by Khalid al-Ansary, Anwar J. Ali and Mudhafer al-Husaini from Baghdad, and Iraqi employees of The New York Times from Baquba and Kirkuk.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
American forces have routed Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the Iraqi militant network, from every neighborhood of Baghdad, a top American general said today, allowing American troops involved in the ''surge'' to depart as planned. 
 Maj. Gen. Joseph F. Fil Jr., commander of United States forces in Baghdad, also said that American troops had yet to clear some 13 percent of the city, including Sadr City and several other areas controlled by Shiite militias. But, he said, ''there's just no question'' that violence had declined since a spike in June. 
 ''Murder victims are down 80 percent from where they were at the peak,'' and attacks involving improvised bombs are down 70 percent, he said. 
 General Fil attributed the decline to improvements in the Iraqi security forces, a cease-fire ordered by the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, the disruption of financing for insurgents, and, most significant, Iraqis' rejection of ''the rule of the gun.'' 
 His comments, in a broad interview over egg rolls and lo mein in a Green Zone conference room, were the latest in a series of upbeat assessments he and other commanders have offered in recent months. But his descriptions revealed a city still in transition: tormented by its past, struggling to find a better future. 
 ''The Iraqi people have just decided that they've had it up to here with violence,'' he said, while noting that their demands for electricity, water and jobs have intensified. 
 Hundreds, if not thousands, of displaced families are returning to their homes, but a majority of them are still afraid to go back to neighborhoods now segregated by sect. ''Clearly,'' General Fil said, ''it will take some time for Baghdad to restore itself to what it was.''
 He and other military commanders have maintained for months that the conditions for national reconciliation have been met. They argue that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, the homegrown Sunni extremist group that American intelligence agencies say is foreign-led, has been weakened. They cite in particular the rise of the American-supported citizen volunteers -- 67,000 nationwide, according to military figures. 
 And though Sunni extremist groups could revive and ''reinfest very quickly,'' General Fil said, Iraq's leaders should now have the peace they need to build a trusted, cross-sectarian government. But progress toward that, he said, has been ''disappointing.'' 
 Soon, General Fil said, there will be fewer troops for the Iraqis to rely on. ''Already we are at a point where we'll see that as the surge forces depart the city, we'll see a natural decline in numbers, and I'm very comfortable where that comes to,'' he said. 
 With less than two months to go before his division heads home, General Fil offered a mixed vision of the military's role for the coming year. He said that if 2007 was the year of security, 2008 would probably be ''a year of reconstruction, a year of infrastructure repair, and a year of, if there's going to be a surge, a year of the surge of the economy.'' 
 He acknowledged that dislodging Shiite militias from control of gasoline, government ministries and other sources of power would be difficult.
 The biggest threat to Baghdad's security is now Shiite militias, he said. Infrastructure weaknesses and unemployment are also serious obstacles, which American efforts at the local level cannot fully address because ''these become national-level problems,'' he said. Violence, meanwhile, despite recent declines in some areas, has moved to some degree to rural villages and towns from major cities, American and Iraqi commanders said. 
 On Wednesday, two children were killed when a roadside bomb exploded on a farm road in Wasit Province. South of Baquba, Iraqi army patrols found 17 bodies, blindfolded, handcuffed and decayed. Four were found headless about 200 yards away. It was the second mass grave discovered in a rural area this week. 
 American troops have recently focused more operations on the farm towns and dusty villages of the country, with the latest coming this week outside Kirkuk in the north. 
 The operations are aimed at maintaining what General Fil described as vital momentum. The greatest challenge of the coming months, he said, will be satisfying the delicate hopes and expectations of Iraqis, who see security not as an end, but just as a beginning. 
 Stability, General Fil said, ''is within sight but not yet within touch.''
 ''Close, but not yet within touch.''

HEADLINE: Marching After Goldwater In the Opposite Direction

BYLINE: By PETER BEINART. 
Peter Beinart is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

 BODY:
THE CONSCIENCE OF A LIBERAL 
 By Paul Krugman 
 296 pages. W. W. Norton. $25.95. 
 In 1960 a brash young conservative writer named L. Brent Bozell Jr. ghost-wrote a book for a brash Republican senator from Arizona named Barry Goldwater. That book, ''The Conscience of a Conservative,'' argued for a radically different relationship between government and the individual than the one to which Americans had become accustomed. 
 To many in the political establishment, the book's argument seemed frightening and alien. But to Goldwater and Bozell it was the mainstreamers who were the true aliens. All they were trying to do, in Godfrey Hodgson's phrase, was ''turn the world right side up'' -- to rediscover an older, better America, one so fundamentally disfigured by decades of liberal government that many Americans did not even realize it was once the norm. 
 The title of Paul Krugman's new book, ''The Conscience of a Liberal,'' is no accident. If Goldwater harked back to the days before the New Deal, when government made few claims on the economic life of the individual, Mr. Krugman harks back to the days before Goldwater, when the New Deal ensured that most individuals (at least if they were white) lived roughly equal economic lives. Like Goldwater he says Americans have forgotten how radical the current political mainstream actually is. And like Goldwater he hopes that by reminding Americans of how different things used to be, he can overcome the fatalism and timidity that prevents fundamental change.
 In invoking Goldwater, Mr. Krugman identifies himself with an argument heard frequently among Bush-era liberals. Bill Clinton, in this view, was a kind of Eisenhower, a well-meaning, competent man unwilling or unable to challenge the core maxims of his time. But now, with conservatism melting down in something like the way liberalism did in the late 1960s and early '70s, the time is ripe for a much bigger ideological reorientation, the kind America has not seen since Bozell, Goldwater and their successors overthrew the political mainstream decades ago.
 Mr. Krugman is well equipped to lead such a charge because his own mainstream credentials are so strong. Just as Bush administration foreign policy has radicalized people like Zbigniew Brzezinski, longtime members in good standing of the centrist foreign establishment, it has turned Mr. Krugman -- a renowned and fairly centrist Princeton economist, as well as an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times -- into a radical critic of American political economy.
 Repeatedly in ''The Conscience of a Liberal'' Mr. Krugman suggests that things we take for granted about the United States economy -- above all, that extreme inequality is an inevitable byproduct of robust economic growth in a globalized age -- are not inevitable at all. Political choices, he argues, not economic laws, have made the United States a nation of the very rich, the very poor and an increasingly fragile middle class. (The book thus offers subtle justification for Mr. Krugman's own evolution from a columnist specializing in economics to one who writes about politics at least as much). His claims are convincing not only because he discusses complex economic questions with rare lucidity and skill, but also because of who he is. Icon destroyers are most powerful when they hail from within the priestly elite. 
 Mr. Krugman is at his best in his chapter on why America needs universal health care, and how we can get it. If Democratic candidates and officials put the case half as well, the campaign for universal coverage -- which Mr. Krugman rightly calls the critical missing piece in America's tattered safety net--has a real chance of success.
 His strangest oversight is his almost complete avoidance of the subject of trade, an area in which he has great expertise, and on which the mainstream economic consensus may be strongest of all. If Mr. Krugman believes liberals should embrace relatively unfettered free trade and investment, that is important to know; it would alienate some of his allies on the left but might convince some as well. If he doesn't, that's equally important, since with his intellectual pedigree and analytical skill he could convince some in the free-trade mainstream to reconsider their views. (He also avoids prescriptions on immigration policy, an issue on which -- judging from his columns -- he has ambivalent but provocative views.) 
 Mr. Krugman's historical chapters do a good job of explaining how the American welfare state emerged in the 1930s and '40s (although he is oddly dismissive of the earlier efforts of progressives like Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson and Robert La Follette) and why that welfare state made people's lives better. On the unraveling of that liberal consensus he is weaker. His portrait of the rising conservative movement is a little cartoonish. There's no question that corporate money and racial division played powerful roles, but to describe the early years of William F. Buckley's National Review only by mentioning its support for segregation and admiration for Franco, with no mention of fusionism, isn't worthy of someone of Mr. Krugman's intellectual sophistication. 
 Similarly, his account of liberalism's fall barely mentions its self-inflicted wounds. He is right to argue that the Democratic Party's political weakness on foreign policy came largely after Vietnam, not during it. But he exonerates Jimmy Carter's foreign policy in two sentences. (He would have done well to read the discussion of Mr. Carter in John Lewis Gaddis's ''Strategies of Containment.'') And he never even mentions Democratic opposition to the gulf war. 
 Readers interested in understanding liberalism's decline and radical conservatism's rise can find better books. But those who turn to Mr. Krugman to understand what's unjust about the United States economy, and why it doesn't have to be this way, will be amply rewarded. And as Democrats seek a rationale not merely for returning to power, but for fundamentally changing -- or changing back -- the relationship between America's government and its citizens, Mr. Krugman's arguments will prove vital in the months and years ahead.

HEADLINE: The Artist's Fall Collection

BYLINE: By RUTH LA FERLA; Ana Facio Contreras contributed reporting.

 BODY:
KERI EVILSIZOR trained a covetous eye on the handbags pristinely arrayed on white-lacquered shelves. She was not quite sure what to make of the display, housed in a 1,000-square-foot island of commerce inside the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles. No matter. She was there to shop. 
 Ms. Evilsizor, who had come from San Francisco nominally to see an exhibition of paintings and sculpture by the Japanese artist Takashi Murakami, was delighted. Here was a luxury store -- operated by Louis Vuitton, no less -- in the midst of a high-tone exhibition space. 
 She was even able to snare a trophy, a handbag designed by Marc Jacobs, the Vuitton creative director, with the company's monogram -- and one of Mr. Murakami's raucously colorful cartoon images. Sizing up the haute Bohemian crowd milling about in T-shirts, premium jeans and pricey knee-high boots, she noted, ''There's definitely a large percentage of people who are here for the purses.'' 
 Visitors were indeed snapping up the limited-edition leather goods, embellished with Mr. Murakami's cartoon hands and Chibi Kinoko mushroom-shaped characters. And most seemed to sense that they were witness to a marriage made in mercantile heaven. 
 The show, with its $960 handbags and $695 agendas for sale, created a flap even before its opening on Oct. 29. Art-world purists charge that it has eroded the line between culture and commerce. ''It has turned the museum into a sort of upscale Macy's,'' the art critic Dave Hickey chided in an interview.
 Still, at a time when artworks are purchased like luxury goods -- the on-canvas equivalent of a Lamborghini or Revillon sable-lined raincoat -- the shop-within-the-show serves as a rarefied marketing tool. It provides a glossy platform for both merchant and artist seeking to extend his brand, one that ideally confers a cachet that translates into galloping sales. 
 The first deluxe boutique to be integrated in a formal exhibition, the Murakami-Vuitton store is ''a terrific example of not just the artist embracing commercial success but proactively going after it,'' said Elizabeth Currid, the author of ''The Warhol Economy: How Fashion, Art and Music Drive New York City'' (Princeton University Press, 2007). In this kind of venture, everyone profits, Ms. Currid said. ''You are creating a new kind of product, one that expands the economic horizons of all the parties involved.''
 That venture has also trained a spotlight on a trend that is picking up steam. True, artists have aligned themselves with luxury brands since the 1930s at least, when Salvador Dali and Jean Cocteau placed their surrealist stamp on fashions by Elsa Schiaparelli. But such formerly rare and mostly unsung unions are now increasingly common -- and profitable. Small wonder, then, that artists of the stature of a Damien Hirst or Richard Prince are vying to lend their imprimatur to a range of designer goods. 
 ''Artist products are the current thing,'' said Jeffrey Deitch, the art dealer and a former associate of Andy Warhol, the acknowledged master of artist self-branding. A generation ago, the mating dance between culture and commerce was regarded as heresy, Mr. Deitch acknowledged. But today, he added, such alliances are ''just one of the avenues available to the artist who wants to get his message to the public.''
 Exhibit A: Mr. Murakami. Before he teamed up with Vuitton five years ago, he was known primarily to art aficionados. That collaboration was a marketing tour de force so spectacular that it created a waiting list in the thousands for the artist-bags. Indeed, a case could be made that it turned Mr. Murakami into a celebrity viewed by his fans as the pudgy, goateed Heath Ledger of the art world.
 So where's the rub? Mr. Murakami made his name, after all, by taking the culture of branding as his primary subject. Tellingly, his show is titled ''$; Murakami.''
 And yet the installation -- a shop that lines the pockets of the artist and his corporate partner -- would appear to compromise the authority and curatorial role of the Museum of Contemporary Art. Not so says Paul Schimmel, the museum's chief curator. He pointed out that the museum receives no rental fees or profits from the store. To do so would place its nonprofit status at risk. 
 Vuitton did not pay for the show; however, it did underwrite a splashy opening-night party that attracted celebrities like Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell and Pharrell Williams. 
 Mr. Schimmel further maintained that the boutique is integral to the artist's message. ''One of the most radical aspects of Murakami's work is his willingness both to embrace and exploit the idea of his brand, to mingle his identity with a corporate identity and play with that,'' he said. ''He realized from the beginning that if you don't address the commercial aspect of the work, it's somehow like the elephant in the room.''
 Such arguments have done their part to defuse potential controversy. The museum, said Gail Andrews, director of the Birmingham Museum of Art in Alabama and president of the Association of Art Museum Directors, ''has made the case that luxury goods are a part of Murakami's artistic expression. They are doing what contemporary museums do, pushing the boundaries.''
 To say nothing of luring visitors into the tent. Indeed, the museum has been a major beneficiary of the collaboration. ''We are certain that it has brought audiences and visibility to MOCA,'' Mr. Schimmel said. 
 Such a reception bodes well for merchants, who are forever chasing the next marketing coup. Now that fashion endorsements by Hollywood stars are as common as ragweed, progressive fashion makers are moving on. ''To be perceived as cutting edge, they must make use of a different kind of celebrity,'' said Ms. Currid, the author of Warhol book. ''They need an art star.''
 That wisdom was not lost on Levi Strauss. Last year the company attempted to boost its hip quotient by issuing Warhol Factory X, a line of jeans embroidered or printed with familiar Warhol touches: Marilyn patches, squiggles, newsprint patterns. This year, seeking to trump its own success, it joined forces with Mr. Hirst, the British art renegade. Today trophy hunters who can't afford a Hirst skull, spot or splatter painting can aspire to the diffusion line, in which denim is the canvas for familiar motifs extracted from Mr. Hirst's iconic works. Call it the rag trade answer to a lithograph. 
 In recent years Fendi and the luggage label Longchamp have traded on the luster of art-world names. Longchamp, in an effort to inject brashness into its somewhat fusty image, joined forces with Tracey Emin, the British artist notorious for incorporating condoms, cigarette butts and other detritus of her private life into her artwork. 
 This year Mulberry enlisted the London artist Julie Verhoeven to embellish a collection of bags, scarves and dresses with her erotically charged melanges of flowers and girlish faces. 
 No marketing laggard, Mr. Jacobs, a collector of artworks by John Currin, Elizabeth Peyton and Mr. Prince, lent the art-slash-fashion trend fresh impetus this fall by inviting Mr. Prince to conceive a handbag line for Vuitton. The partnership could not have been better timed: a 30-year survey of the artist's work is at the Guggenheim Museum. And the company is betting that the bags, some stamped with cartoons, will appeal to the same affluent tastemakers who regard Mr. Prince as a household name. 
 ''If you look at the world of art people interested in contemporary art, they are usually interested in luxury,'' said Yves Carcelle, the president of Louis Vuitton. ''The bridge between the two worlds is more and more obvious.'' Mr. Carcelle underscored the point by noting that 60 of the MOCA Murakami bags were sold in the show's first week alone.
 Referring to the original Murakami leather goods, Mr. Carcelle added, ''For us, the payoff has been extraordinary.'' He declined to break out sales figures but said that the Murakami profits, which account for only a small percentage of the Vuitton business, add up to more than the total profits of some competing brands. 
 Such products, a kind of art couture, appeal primarily to a rising class of affluent culture chasers, ''people who are very focused on having those hip luxury signifiers,'' in the words of Simon Doonan, the creative director of Barneys New York. Owning such products ''signifies informed consumption,'' Mr. Doonan said. ''They say: 'I'm not just a shopper. I'm a super groovy shopper.''' 
 That assertion would get no argument from Ellen Black, a San Francisco artist who had come to see the Murakami show. Even visitors only marginally acquainted with Mr. Murakami's signature imagery, she noted, perceived the Vuitton handbags as a get. ''It's interesting how the people who buy them are parading them around,'' she said. ''To them, the image on this bag becomes like a badge.''
 It does make you wonder, she said.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Democrats Grapple With Rebuke of Stem Cell Initiative

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and JEREMY W. PETERS; Jonathan Miller and Andrew Pollack contributed reporting.

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 7 

 BODY:
Stung and puzzled by the defeat of a ballot initiative to borrow $450 million for stem cell research, leading Democrats in New Jersey struggled on Wednesday to explain why they were repudiated by voters and how they planned to finance the biomedical research for a center already under construction.
 Until Tuesday evening, state officials had said they were confident that the measure -- intended to catapult New Jersey to the forefront of an intense race with other states to lead the way in stem cell research -- would easily pass. Recent polls indicated voters were solidly in favor of the initiative, and Gov. Jon S. Corzine had even contributed $150,000 of his own money to it.
 But instead, the measure was decisively defeated, 53 percent to 47 percent. Even Middlesex County, a staunchly Democratic area where ground was recently broken for the 18-story Stem Cell Institute of New Jersey, rejected the initiative.
 On Wednesday, Mr. Corzine, Senate President Richard J. Codey and other supporters of stem cell research said they had little choice but to ask the state's pharmaceutical companies to help finance the effort and then try to squeeze money from a budget that is already facing a $3 billion shortfall. 
 ''I do have concerns that the delay may very well limit us in a competitive world,'' Mr. Corzine said at a State House news conference.
 He said he still believed that most residents supported the concept of stem cell research despite the objections of anti-abortion groups and the Roman Catholic Church. And he did not rule out putting the measure back on the ballot at some point, although Mr. Codey later told reporters that would not happen next year.
 Democrats said the rejection of the stem cell measure taught them a broader lesson: that voters are frustrated by the bleak fiscal landscape in a state saddled with $30 billion in debt, and they do not trust Trenton to fix the problem.
 ''They've told us to resolve our alarming and pressing financial problems,'' Mr. Corzine said.
 Yet voters approved borrowing $200 million to preserve open space. Explaining the seemingly mixed message, former Gov. Brendan T. Byrne said that the $450 million sought for stem cell research was ''an intimidating figure,'' but that the money for open space was approved because New Jersey has always been environmentally aware.
 From a numerical standpoint, Democrats did not have a terrible night on Tuesday. Buoyed by a fund-raising advantage of three to one, they added a seat to their majority in the Senate, and now have a 23-to-17 edge; they lost two seats in the Assembly, and now have a 48-to-32 advantage. 
 Still, another ballot measure showed just how disgruntled many voters were -- or at least the estimated 30 percent of registered voters who bothered to cast their ballots. (According to the attorney general's office, until this year the lowest turnout had been 31 percent, in 1991.)
 They rejected a proposal that would have funneled money from last year's sales tax increase to property tax rebates, something critics of the plan had dismissed as an election-year gimmick. 
 ''I think the voters cut up the credit card,'' said Ruth B. Mandel, director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University. ''They said, 'We're not going to let you borrow any more money until you can pay our bills.'''
 Proponents of stem cell research view it as an opportunity to develop cures for diseases like diabetes and Parkinson's. But opponents call it an unproven pseudoscience that requires the destruction of human embryos and opens the door to human cloning.
 Several Catholic churches in the state circulated fliers during Sunday services expressing qualms about the initiative.
 ''Certainly a number of people in the state heard our message about ethical stem cell research, and were moved,'' said James G. Goodman, a spokesman for the Archdiocese of Newark. ''But there certainly were many financial reasons in people's minds as well.''
 One television commercial produced by New Jersey Right to Life, an anti-abortion group, said: ''Research has not produced one cure. Not one. Question 2 is about taking your tax dollars for something that Wall Street and the drug companies will not invest in. Think about it.''
 On Wednesday, Mr. Corzine -- who made embryonic stem cell research a major issue in his 2005 campaign for governor -- blamed himself and other supporters of the measure for not doing a good enough job educating the public about the potential economic benefits. He also said the campaign could have done a better job clarifying that the $450 million was to be borrowed over 10 years, rather than all at once.
 ''Twenty-twenty hindsight is always better,'' he said. ''It obviously needed an additional boost to get voters out that would identify with this issue. But that's easy to say the morning after.'' 
 How the defeat of the initiative will affect the research complex going up in New Brunswick was unclear. While the state had already committed $270 million for construction costs for that building as well as others around the state, Ronald S. Heymann, vice president of New Jersey Citizens' Coalition for Cures, which advocates stem cell research, said that if the money did not materialize, the building ''shouldn't be sitting there empty.'' 
 Mr. Heymann and others expressed concern that any delays in securing research grants could drive scientists elsewhere.
 ''Every time the resource is denied to this research it's tragic,'' said Robert N. Klein, the chairman of a board overseeing a $3 billion stem cell program in California. ''For California to carry the leadership for a great part of the nation alone is a monumental task.''
 But for many New Jersey voters, there are more pressing issues.
 Beth Sarsfield, a 49-year-old chemist who works in New Brunswick, said that although she had voted for the stem cell measure, she was not upset that it had been rejected. ''I didn't think it was going to be totally effective,'' she said.
 Ms. Sarsfield said that her mother -- like her, a loyal Democrat -- had voted against the measure.
 ''I think there are a lot of people who think there's a lot of debt in New Jersey,'' Ms. Sarsfield said. ''From people in my family, they did not feel it was going to be sufficiently funded and that it would be ineffective -- it was going to be a waste with debt.''
 Asked if her mother had struggled in making her decision, Ms. Sarsfield answered quickly, with a word that was reverberating around the state: ''No.''

HEADLINE: Tax Proposal From Rangel Could Benefit His Donors

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee has proposed legislation that would effectively halt some current tax audits of people who get a tax break for living and operating a business in the United States Virgin Islands.
 Many beneficiaries of the tax break are campaign contributors to the lawmaker, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, according to data collected by CQ MoneyLine, which tracks political contributions. 
 At least one of them, Richard G. Vento, is currently under audit, according to court filings. Mr. Vento gave $4,400 last year to the Baucus-Rangel Leadership Fund, which supports Mr. Rangel and Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee. 
 Beneficiaries of the tax break including Michael W. Masters and Richard H. Driehaus, money managers, accounted for more than half the $51,900 that individuals in the Virgin Islands gave last year to Rangel for Congress, the chairman's campaign organization. Mr. Rangel raised almost three times as much from such donors last year as in any other year in the MoneyLine database.
 Mr. Rangel says his measure is simply an effort to address a discrepancy between the Internal Revenue Service's treatment of Americans living in the Virgin Islands and its treatment of their mainland counterparts. Except in cases of fraud, the agency has three years to cite errors in a mainland resident's tax payments. But since 2006, under I.R.S. rulings stemming from the agency's efforts to crack down on abuse of the tax break, it has faced no such time limit in auditing Virgin Islands residents.
 The Rangel provision would restore the statute of limitations in the islands.
 ''This is a fundamental matter of fairness,'' the congressman said in a statement. ''U.S. citizens living in the Virgin Islands should be afforded the same protections as citizens living here.''
 As to whether donations from such taxpayers had influenced his decision to offer the proposal, he said, ''I am overwhelmed with appreciation for the support I have received from across the nation, and I am certain that I have had supporters from the U.S.V.I. well before the question of legislation ever came about.''
 The provision is in a broader tax relief bill intended to prevent some 21 million American households from falling subject to the alternative minimum tax this year. That broader bill was approved by Mr. Rangel's committee last week.
 The Virgin Islands tax break -- an effective federal tax rate of only 3.5 percent on income earned in the islands -- is tied to a program to encourage economic development there. It has existed since the 1960s, but it gained momentum over the last decade as the Virgin Islands government opened the program to services companies in an effort to attract educated, affluent workers.
 Financial services companies and their executives began flocking to the islands, taking steps like contributing to local charities as ways of establishing residency, which was required to capitalize on the program's tax benefits.
 The I.R.S. became suspicious that many were spending more time running their businesses on the mainland than in the islands, and in 2003 it undertook enforcement efforts that, lawyers in the islands say, have ensnared some 100 taxpayers, not all wealthy.
 Mr. Rangel's proposal would end any such audits involving years before 2004. That upsets Senator Charles E. Grassley, an Iowa Republican responsible for legislation that year that tightened rules governing taxes on Americans in the Virgin Islands.
 ''Congress rarely takes action that affects ongoing I.R.S. audits,'' Mr. Grassley said in a statement, ''so it's striking that House leaders are proposing changes in the statute of limitations for U.S. taxpayers who are newly claiming residency in the Virgin Islands.''
 Marjorie Rawls Roberts, a lawyer who represents Mr. Vento and other Virgin Islands residents, said some of her clients might benefit from the provision, but not all of them. 
 ''The limits would end some audits at least for some years,'' Ms. Roberts said. ''At the same time, the I.R.S. has sought and received timely extensions from some taxpayers, including Mr. Vento, and in cases where extensions have been granted, the new limits would not apply.''
 Ms. Roberts, who is herself a donor to Mr. Rangel, and other lawyers said the agency had closed only a handful of the audits undertaken. At least one beneficiary of the tax break has pleaded guilty to tax fraud, and four others were indicted on tax and wire-fraud charges in March.
 Mr. Vento is fighting the I.R.S. in court over its claim that he was not a bona fide resident of the Virgin Islands in 2001, when he made some $180 million from the sale of a company he had founded, and that he therefore owes back taxes. In the meantime, the agency continues to look at subsequent years.
 Some lawyers speculate that the I.R.S. eliminated its time limit last year simply because inquiries involving the tax break were multiplying faster than it could handle them.
 ''I think they are conducting audits that are spinning out of control, and so some genius decided to just get rid of the statute of limitations,'' said David Marshall Nissman, a former United States attorney for the Virgin Islands who says he has five or six clients currently under audit.
 Mr. Nissman said many newer participants in the economic development program withdrew from it after it came under intense scrutiny from Congress and news organizations in 2004. ''I think for the most part the abusers are gone,'' he said. ''But I'm sure there are still a few.''

HEADLINE: On Campaign Stump, Romney Preaches the Importance of Optimism

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

 BODY:
The question put to Mitt Romney at the Republican presidential debate in Michigan several weeks ago seemed to be a golden opportunity for him to show off his vaunted analytical side. Maria Bartiromo, a CNBC commentator, asked the candidate what he thought posed ''the greatest long-term threat'' to the American economy. 
 But instead of summoning a litany of facts and statistics, Mr. Romney suggested that the greatest threat was this: ''Our sense of optimism. America has to be optimistic and recognize that there's nothing we can't overcome.'' 
 The gauzy answer might have surprised some observers, but the comments fit into the sunny mien that Mr. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, has tried, with varying degrees of success, to carry off since the beginning of his campaign. 
 Each of the leading Republican contenders has sought to channel in some way the shiny optimism that helped make Ronald Reagan, who famously campaigned on the slogan that it was ''morning again in America,'' so popular. But it is Mr. Romney who has most thoroughly incorporated such sunbeamy phrases and anecdotes into his repertory on the stump.
 Audience members often say they appreciate his positivism, but his pleased-as-punch ebullience can also come across as forced or, worse, play into caricatures of him as being too polished to be real.
 The idea of optimism trumping pessimism is one of the lessons Republicans draw from the Reagan experience -- his genial outlook in the 1980 election became something of an antidote to President Jimmy Carter's declaration of malaise. But there are clearly times when optimism can run aground. The first President George Bush lost the 1992 election in part by appearing not concerned enough about the impact of the recession on average Americans. 
 Mr. Romney's reference to the importance of optimism at the Michigan debate was actually the second conspicuously chipper remark he made that evening, having declared earlier that the best way to win back confidence in the economy was by ''pointing out that the future's going to be even brighter than our past.''
 ''I am optimistic about this country, if you haven't got that measure already,'' he said recently in a speech on global trade in Greenwood, S.C., in which he called for the formation of a ''Reagan zone of economic freedom.'' 
 ''You see,'' he said, ''I've been across the country. I've met people from, boy, a lot of states; and you come away confident that the American people have the heart to succeed at everything we put our minds to.''
 In his appearances, Mr. Romney almost invariably pivots, sometimes rather abruptly, from talking about the challenges facing the country to squeeze in a soaring anecdote or two about the strength of the American spirit and why the country remains the ''hope of the world.'' 
 Earlier in the year, Mr. Romney was asked at a Republican debate at the Ronald W. Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., to describe what he did not like about America.
 ''Gosh, I love America,'' Mr. Romney said. ''I'm afraid I'm going to be at a loss for words because America for me is not just our rolling mountains and hills and streams and great cities. It's the American people. And the American people are the greatest people in the world. What makes America the greatest nation in the world is the heart of the American people.''
 He also made clear who his source of inspiration was: ''It's that optimism we thank Ronald Reagan for.'' 
 Mr. Romney's advisers said the hopefulness he had worked so assiduously to deliver on the stump was simply a part of his personality, and that was confirmed by several people who worked on his 2002 campaign for governor but are not affiliated with his run for president. ''The campaign mantra was 'Clean up the mess on Beacon Hill,' which was a blend of optimism and pessimism,'' said Jonathan Spampinato, who was Mr. Romney's deputy political director in the 2002 governor's race.
 But Mr. Romney's campaign believes that harnessing positive language is an effective way for him to distinguish himself from his rivals, like Rudolph W. Giuliani, whose relentless focus on the threat of Islamic terrorism can feel dark to some, and Senator John McCain, who has maintained a dour resolve about the Iraq war.
 ''Early on, we recognized it as a strength,'' said Kevin Madden, Mr. Romney's national press secretary. ''We see what it is that voters really respond to, and it is an optimism and can-do spirit that he has toward everything.''
 There are limits, of course, to Mr. Romney's emulation of Reagan. Political observers note that Mr. Romney, who built his vast personal fortune as a corporate takeover specialist, lacks Reagan's common touch and neighborly charm. 
 Part of the struggle for Mr. Romney, whose father was chairman of American Motors before becoming governor of Michigan, is his background, which is much more affluent than Reagan's, said Craig Shirley, a conservative consultant unaffiliated with any of the presidential campaigns who has written a book about Reagan. 
 ''Reagan's was a hardscrabble upbringing,'' Mr. Shirley said. ''His father was an itinerant shoe salesman. He knew what it was like to work hard, what it was like to go without, to go through the Depression.''
 Mr. Shirley said he would give Mr. Romney a ''gentleman's C'' in his Reaganesque efforts, crediting him with understanding the potency of optimism better than others but cautioned him about ''trying too hard.''

CORRECTION-DATE: November 10, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about Mitt Romney's emphasis during campaign appearances on the need for Americans to be optimistic referred incorrectly to President Jimmy Carter's description of the mood of the United States in 1979. In a speech that year, Mr. Carter discussed a ''crisis of the American spirit,'' but he did not use the word ''malaise.''

HEADLINE: Rubin Is Reported Set to Back Clinton

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
Robert E. Rubin, Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration and new chairman of Citigroup, has overcome early misgivings about Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton's presidential candidacy and will support her publicly in the fight for the Democratic nomination, people close to both of them said yesterday. 
 Mr. Rubin has lent his name to Mrs. Clinton's last major fund-raising event of 2007, to be held in New York City on Dec. 13, and may appear with her or former President Bill Clinton on other occasions before the primaries and caucuses begin in January.
 Aside from the backing of Al Gore, Mr. Rubin's endorsement has been the biggest prize from the Clinton administration still up for grabs, given his stature as one of the most widely admired economic stewards in Democratic politics. Because he is a deficit hawk, his support could also be a bulwark against Republican accusations that Mrs. Clinton is a free-spending liberal.
 Despite his relationship with the former president, Mr. Rubin was not an early supporter of Mrs. Clinton's candidacy. The two clashed in the Clinton White House over health care reform and economic and budget priorities, and Democrats close to Mr. Rubin said yesterday that he expressed concerns to friends last winter about whether she would be the party's strongest nominee. One of Mr. Rubin's sons, James, has been a major fund-raiser for a Clinton rival, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois.
 But, Democrats say, Mr. Rubin has been impressed with Mrs. Clinton's performance as a candidate this year. He has also generally favored her economic and domestic policy platforms, partly shaped by two of his allies from the Clinton era, Gene Sperling and Roger Altman.

HEADLINE: Bending Ears On Economics As '08 Nears

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
On the campaign trail, Barack Obama and John Edwards are aggressively pitting themselves against Hillary Rodham Clinton in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. But when it comes to something as fundamental as economic policy, the lineup quietly shifts: It is Senators Obama and Clinton against Mr. Edwards.
 The shift is evident in the candidates' senior economic advisers. While both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have turned to moderately progressive advisers to help them elaborate their own preferences, Mr. Edwards is charting a different, more populist course.
 ''If you want to have some esoteric debate about economic theory, you end up justifying free trade or supply side economics,'' said Leo J. Hindery Jr., a cable-television entrepreneur now engaged in private equity who is serving as Mr. Edwards's top adviser on economic issues. ''What we do for Edwards,'' he said, ''is give him policy advice based on specific concerns that he has.'' 
 This is not the 1960s, when Walter Heller famously instructed John F. Kennedy in Keynesian economics, or the late 1970s, when Arthur Laffer popularized supply-side economics as Ronald Reagan ran for office -- each gaining fame as a teacher of presidents.
 ''The field of economics has changed enough so that grand theories don't have the avid adherents they once did and that has undermined the role of the guru/tutor,'' said Austan Goolsbee, an economist at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Business. ''Now it is, 'Let's bring in experts on specific issues, like housing or trade or wages.'''
 Mr. Goolsbee is the senior economic adviser to Mr. Obama and the only Ph.D. economist among the top advisers on the Democratic side. The names on the door at Mrs. Clinton's headquarters include Gene B. Sperling, a lawyer by training who was national economic director in Bill Clinton's second term as president, and Roger C. Altman, a Wall Street investment banker who served in the Clinton Treasury. 
 The four leading Republican candidates, by contrast, have appointed professional economists as their senior advisers, all of them veterans of the current Bush administration or the administration of President Bush's father. They generally embrace the president's laissez-faire economic policies, as do the candidates they support. 
 Democrats agree on some fundamentals of their own, among them allowing the president's tax cuts to expire for those in higher income brackets and embracing universal health care to cover the tens of millions of uninsured Americans.
 But as the prospects improve for a Democrat to capture the White House, divisions are emerging as well, mainly over trade and budget deficits. While Mr. Edwards attacks the trade agreements now before Congress, Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama tend to support them. Mr. Edwards also pushes for public infrastructure spending even if that means more deficit spending than the two senators endorse. 
 The Republican candidates, showing their unity on economic policy, would extend the president's tax cuts rather than let most of them expire in 2010 as the Democrats prefer. They endorse free trade with none of the restrictions that Democrats now seek. 
 Regarding health insurance, they would keep government involvement to a minimum, shunning the elaborate plans the Democrats have proposed. For them, public investment would be mostly devoted to making repairs to the nation's infrastructure, not expanding it, as the Democrats say they want to do.
 ''All of the Democratic presidential candidates are significantly to the left of us on economic policy,'' said R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Business and the first chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. 
 Mr. Hubbard is now in Mitt Romney's corner as senior economist. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, director of the Congressional Budget Office in the early Bush years, is advising Senator John McCain. Michael J. Boskin, the top adviser to Rudolph Giuliani, served President George H. W. Bush as chairman of his Council of Economic Advisers, while Lawrence B. Lindsey, who was the current president's chief economic adviser at the start of his administration, is now Fred Thompson's senior economist. 
 The senior advisers, with their prestige and stature, are the public faces of economic policy for the presidential candidates -- Democrats and Republicans alike. But they are also on a leash. The paid staff members in each campaign have a lot to say, and considerable control. 
 Mr. Hindery, for example, postponed an interview until he had clearance from James Kvaal, policy director for the Edwards campaign. And Mr. Sperling, for all his political prominence, declined to be interviewed, even off the record, until he had clearance from Mrs. Clinton's policy director, Neera Tanden. Later, Mr. Kvaal and Ms. Tanden called to go over positions.
 ''We should be trying to balance the budget,'' Mr. Kvaal said, but he bridled at the Clinton camp's emphasis on moving promptly to eliminate the deficit. ''Investments in health care, energy and education,'' he said, ''are more important for our economy, even if that means sustaining the deficit for a while.''
 Among all the senior economic advisers in both parties, only Mr. Goolsbee, a relative newcomer to politics, spoke on the record and without advance clearance. Ask him how he got his position with Mr. Obama's campaign, and he cites friends in common who steered the candidate and the economist toward each other at the University of Chicago, where both taught. Mr. Obama was running for the Senate at the time. 
 ''He and I saw eye-to-eye on economic stuff,'' said Mr. Goolsbee, who describes himself as a centrist. (He also is a contributor to The New York Times.)
 One of the crucial jobs for the senior advisers is to consult with a variety of experts, most of them economists, on specific issues: trade, family income, public investment, wage inequality, health insurance, poverty, education, and the like. Many in this pool give advice to all three Democratic front-runners. 
 ''We end up consulting a lot of the same people,'' Mr. Goolsbee said. 
 One of those is Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the labor-oriented Economic Policy Institute and an expert on income and wages. These are big issues in a primary campaign that focuses on what the three Democratic candidates perceive as a rising angst among voters suffering from income stagnation, job insecurity and foreign competition. While Mr. Bernstein's favorite is Mr. Edwards, he nevertheless sees himself as supporting whoever finally gets the nomination. 
 ''Everybody knows that you drift to the left in the primaries and to the center for the general election,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''It is a matter of degrees and everyone, including myself, has to build a sense of how earnest these candidates are. I think they are all very sincere.''
 Many of the others advising one or another of the Democratic candidates say it is their intention, too, to support the eventual Democratic nominee, despite the differences that are developing over trade, public investment and balancing the budget. 
 Mr. Sperling, for example, argues that while public investment is important, so is cutting the deficit. The late '90s boom, Mr. Sperling said during a recent panel discussion, might never have happened if the Clinton administration had not managed to push through the tax increases and limits on spending that helped turn the deficit into a surplus.
 ''We are trying to strike a balance'' between fiscal discipline and public investment, he said -- taking a position that Mr. Obama seems to share, but not Mr. Edwards. 
 The division widened after Mr. Edwards issued a statement on Oct. 27 strongly opposing a trade agreement with Peru, now before Congress. He declared that the Nafta-like agreement, among other aspects he found objectionable, ''created incentives to relocate jobs overseas.'' 
 Less than a week later, the House Ways and Means Committee approved the agreement and Representative Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the trade subcommittee, called the vote ''a historic breakthrough'' because the agreement ''for the first time incorporates international worker standards.''
 Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, in contrast to Mr. Edwards, cite enforceable labor standards as a good reason to support a trade agreement, including the one with Peru. 
 Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, and still the eminence grise of the party's Clinton wing, favors the Peru agreement. Mr. Rubin, named chairman of Citigroup last Sunday, has stated that he would like to see Mrs. Clinton become president. He will make some campaign appearances with her before year's end. 
 His stature will make him the de facto senior economic adviser in the Clinton campaign. But if Mr. Obama wins in the primaries and gets the nomination, Mr. Rubin would migrate to the Obama camp. His son, James Rubin, already works with Mr. Obama. 
 Mr. Edwards, as far as Mr. Rubin is concerned, is another matter. He has no links to the Edwards camp, and their differences over budget balancing and trade agreements keep them apart.
 Some of the experts consulting with the various Democratic candidates might follow Mr. Rubin's lead, shunning the Edwards candidacy. Right now, the list of floaters includes Alan Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, and Alan Krueger, both at Princeton; Lawrence Katz and Elizabeth Warren at Harvard; Jacob S.

HEADLINE: As Deer Think of Wooing, Maine Thinks of Deer

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
AS a sport, hunting suffers from something of an image problem. To many nonhunters, the idea of shooting an animal is barbaric, associated with rich men collecting trophies or beer-guzzling brutes in pickup trucks.
 And hunters tend to have an equally dim view of their critics: naive hypocrites who don't understand where their dinner comes from.
 But in rural Maine on the opening day of deer season -- an event anticipated like a national holiday in some parts of the country -- it is obvious that the gap separating hunters and nonhunters isn't necessarily about guns, or even animals. In places like Jackman, it has more to do with the growing distance between those who live in America's concrete communities and the dwindling population whose lives, and livelihoods, are more closely tied to the woods. 
 Jackman is one of those small towns where life revolves around deer hunting every autumn. Although bow-hunting season began in September, opening day for firearms, Oct. 27, is the big date on the calendar. 
 ''For Maine residents, deer hunting is something they look forward to for the whole year,'' said Paul Jacques, deputy commissioner of the state's Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. ''For the next month, the first thing you say when you see someone in a restaurant is, 'How you doin' -- did you get your deer yet?'''
 Jackman is about 160 miles northwest of Portland and 16 miles southeast of the Canadian border. It has a population of about 700, a couple of gas stations, a general store and a few bars and restaurants, the kind where a waitress greets you by name when you walk in, or conversation stops and heads turn to survey the stranger in town.
 The local economy relies mostly on timber and tourism, which cycles seasonally through snowmobiling, whitewater rafting, fishing and hunting. But for many businesses, it's hunting season that keeps them afloat.
 ''We have a fair business the rest of the year -- we get by,'' said Travis Rogers, manager of Bait, Bolts & Bullets in Solon. ''But this is when we make our money.''
 Attending to a steady stream of customers picking up bullets and buck lure the afternoon before opening day, Mr. Rogers estimated that 60 percent of the store's sales came during the fall hunting season, from September to early December, including the dates allocated to various weapons and prey.
 But from a biological perspective, deer season is timed to ''the rut'': when does are in heat and bucks run around chasing them -- generally in November, but each state manages its deer population by regulating the length of the hunting season and how many permits are issued to shoot a doe (which are separate from general hunting licenses).
 To capitalize on this mating ritual, hunting stores are filled with products like ''rattling bags,'' which mimic the sound of deer antlers knocking as two bucks spar over a doe, and deer calls with names like Bleat-in-Heat. Mr. Rogers was also selling T-shirts with slogans like ''Vegetarian -- an Old Indian Word for Poor Hunter'' and a selection of blaze orange hats and vests.
 Many out-of-towners come to Maine for the state's big-antlered bucks, and there are sporting camps and lodges that offer services to help them get a deer. 
 One of those lodges is Northern Outdoors in The Forks, a hamlet where the Kennebec and the Dead Rivers meet, about 30 miles south of Jackman. Founded as a whitewater rafting company in 1975, it has since branched out to offer hunting and fishing packages, mostly to create business year-round.
 ''For this part of the state of Maine, there would be no business without hunting,'' said Russell Walters, the company's president, who was busy getting ready for the season's first wave of guests. Those guests typically come for a week and get more than a little help from guides like Dan Davis, who was sporting a coonskin cap made from an animal he had trapped himself.
 He had spent the previous few weeks scouting for deer, setting up tree stands, cutting shooting lanes and marking paths to the stands with ribbon. When asked if his efforts made hunting too easy for guests, he smiled and said diplomatically, ''With all the tricks we've got today, it shouldn't be hard for anyone to get a deer.''
 Even so, he estimated that only 1 in 10 guests kills a deer -- roughly the same percentage of licensed hunters who get a deer statewide. About 30,000 deer are killed by hunters in Maine each year, compared with more than 500,000 in Wisconsin, generally the biggest deer-hunting state. Those numbers may seem high, but state wildlife managers say hunters are critical to keeping deer herds in check.
 ''Without management, the deer population would get out of control,'' said Matt Frank, secretary of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. He explained that an uncontrolled population could lead to overbrowsed vegetation, increased road accidents and empty bellies. ''You don't want to have the population get so large that the deer starve,'' he said.
 One of the biggest concerns for wildlife management agencies is that younger generations aren't as interested in hunting, which is why many states are experimenting with youth hunting days and programs to get teenagers away from their computers and into the woods.
 That's also a worry for businesses that rely on hunting, not to mention towns that want to preserve a tradition generations have passed on.
 ''It's getting so that there are just people our age and older who are hunting,'' said Ray Levesque, owner of Bishop's General Store in Jackman. ''We need to get the kids involved.'' He rousted his two sons, ages 10 (the legal hunting age in Maine) and 13, before dawn on opening day to go hunting -- without complaint from them, he said.
 Besides selling gas, sandwiches, soda and supplies, Bishop's operates as an official tagging station for the area, which means it is one of the places hunters bring their deer to be documented and weighed, information that gets passed on to the state. 
 Hunting, it turns out, is highly regulated, with rules governing everything from what shade of orange hunters must wear to what time they can start shooting (typically, half an hour before sunrise).
 But opening day in Jackman was dark and rainy, so there wasn't much movement in town before dawn. Donavan Nadeau, a local painter, was one of the few people out early, gassing up his truck in camouflage pants, a matching jacket and orange cap, undeterred by the pouring rain.
 ''A day like this is pretty good because it's quiet and you can get up behind them,'' he said, gamely answering questions about the biggest buck he'd shot (a 200-pound eight-pointer) and how he chose where to hunt (''It's a guessing game more than anything -- a lot of it is luck'').
 He described the signs hunters look for: where bucks paw the ground or rub their antlers against trees, the droppings and tracks.
 ''That's what's exciting about hunting,'' he said, grinning and eager to be on his way. ''It's amazing if you pay attention to detail.''
 DRIVING down a muddy back road with a photographer a bit later, I got a reception that wasn't quite as friendly. Spotting a bearded man in a bright orange jacket and hat heading into the woods with a gun, we rolled down the window and asked, ''How you doin'?'' 
 ''Just fine if you keep going,'' he answered -- which we did.
 The next stop was Jackman Java, a cafe back in town owned by Gail Stevenson, who grew up on Long Island and lived in California before seeking a fresh start in Jackman in 2004. (While visiting an uncle, she asked God for asign about what to do with her life after a divorce and saw the store for sale.)
 Inside, espresso drinks listed on the menu suggested a city background, but Ms. Stevenson was also embracing country life: she said she was going deer hunting herself that afternoon for the first time. 
 ''I figured when in Rome, do as the Romans do, and everybody around here hunts,'' she said, excusing herself to check on the muffins baking in the oven and to fetch a photo of herself holding a grouse she had shot.
 She wasn't the only female resident of Jackman who went hunting that day. Nancy Jackson, a petite woman with gray hair, was one of the first people to bring a deer in to Bishop's, followed shortly by Skip Parlin, the gruff hunter we'd met in the woods.
 After a wary introduction, he warmed up and showed me how to hold a rifle and aim through the scope, even apologizing for his earlier greeting before driving away with his wife. They were going back out so she could keep trying for her own deer. 
 In all, 15 deer were brought into Bishop's on opening day, including a doe Ms. Stevenson shot within 20 minutes of heading into the woods, according to gossip I heard at a local restaurant that night.
 ''It was eight minutes,'' she told me the next morning, insisting I follow her across the street to see her deer hanging in a neighbor's garage. ''I had so much fun, you cannot believe the adrenaline rush.''
 When asked if she had any reservations about actually pulling the trigger, she didn't hesitate before answering, ''It's a beautiful animal, but it's just part of the food chain -- and I'm trying to be very cost-effective in my life.''
 The butcher was coming by in a few hours, and like most of the residents of Jackman, Ms. Stevenson would fill her freezer with deer meat. In the meantime, she had apple muffins in the oven and a grouse to cook, which she'd also shot the previous day. 
 ''It was the best day hunting I ever had,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Health Care Excuses

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The United States spends far more on health care per person than any other nation. Yet we have lower life expectancy than most other rich countries. Furthermore, every other advanced country provides all its citizens with health insurance; only in America is a large fraction of the population uninsured or underinsured.
 You might think that these facts would make the case for major reform of America's health care system -- reform that would involve, among other things, learning from other countries' experience -- irrefutable. Instead, however, apologists for the status quo offer a barrage of excuses for our system's miserable performance. 
 So I thought it would be useful to offer a catalog of the most commonly heard apologies for American health care, and the reasons they won't wash.
 Excuse No. 1: No insurance, no problem. 
 ''I mean, people have access to health care in America,'' said President Bush a few months ago. ''After all, you just go to an emergency room.'' He was widely mocked for his cluelessness, yet many apologists for the health care system in the United States seem almost equally clueless.
 We're told, for example, that there really aren't that many uninsured American citizens, because some of the uninsured are illegal immigrants, while some of the rest are actually entitled to Medicaid. This misses the point that the 47 million people in this country without insurance are an ever-changing group, so that the experience of being without insurance extends to a much broader group -- in fact, more than one in every three people in America under the age of 65 was uninsured at some point in 2006 or 2007. 
 Oh, and finding out that you're covered by Medicaid when you show up at an emergency room isn't at all the same thing as receiving regular medical care.
 Beyond that, a large fraction of the population -- about one in four nonelderly Americans, according to a Consumer Reports survey -- is underinsured, with ''coverage so meager they often postponed medical care because of costs.''
 So, yes, lack of insurance is a very big problem, a problem that reaches deep into the middle class.
 Excuse No. 2: It's the cheeseburgers. 
 Americans don't have a bad health system, say the apologists, they just have bad habits. Overeating and teenage sex, not the huge overhead of America's private health insurance companies -- the United States spends almost six times as much on health care administration as other advanced countries -- are the source of our problems. 
 There's a grain of truth to this claim: Bad habits may partially explain America's low life expectancy. But the big question isn't why we have lower life expectancy than Britain, Canada or France, it's why we spend far more on health care without getting better results. And lifestyle isn't the explanation: the most definitive estimates, such as those of the McKinsey Global Institute, say that diseases that are associated with obesity and other lifestyle-related problems play, at most, a minor role in high U.S. health care costs.
 Excuse No. 3: 2007 is better than 1950. 
 This is an argument that baffles me, but you hear it all the time. When you point out that America spends far more on health care than other countries, but gets worse results, the apologists reply: ''Sure, we spend a lot of money on health care, but medical care is a lot better than it was in 1950, so it's money well spent.'' Huh?
 It's as if you went to a store to buy a DVD player, and the salesman told you not to worry about the fact that his prices are twice those of his competitors -- after all, the machines on offer at his store are a lot better than they were five years ago. It is, in other words, an argument that makes no sense at all, yet respectable economists make it with a straight face.
 Excuse No. 4: Socialized medicine! Socialized medicine! 
 Rudy Giuliani's fake numbers on prostate cancer -- which, by the way, he still refuses to admit were wrong -- were the latest entry in a long, dishonorable tradition of peddling scare stories about the evils of ''government run'' health care.
 The reality is that the best foreign health care systems, especially those of France and Germany, do as well or better than the U.S. system on every dimension, while costing far less money.
 But the best way to counter scare talk about socialized medicine, aside from swatting down falsehoods -- would journalists please stop saying that Rudy's claims, which are just wrong, are ''in dispute''? -- may be to point out that every American 65 and older is covered by a government health insurance program called Medicare. And Americans like that program very much, thank you.
 So, now you know how to answer the false claims you'll hear about health care. And believe me, you're going to hear them again, and again, and again.

 Broadway
 'A BRONX TALE'Chazz Palminteri stars in a revival of his one-man show from 1989 about growing up under the friendly tutelage of an Italian-American crime kingpin. Tamer than ''The Sopranos,'' certainly, but Mr. Palminteri's sweet, funny stroll down a memory lane peopled by scary men with silly nicknames is a pleasant diversion (1:30). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood) 
 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ben Brantley) 
 'CYRANO DE BERGERAC' David Leveaux's disarming revival of Edmond Rostand's romantic classic is a double shot of silvery hokum, sweet but surprisingly potent. With an artfully low-key Kevin Kline in the title role and a captivating Jennifer Garner as his secret love, the show goes down so easily, you're drunk and misty-eyed before you know it (2:40). Richard Rodgers Theatre, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 
 'GREASE' A limp revival of a musical set in a high school that feels like a musical put on by a high school. Kathleen Marshall directs and choreographs a charisma-free ensemble, whose leads (Max Crumm and Laura Osnes) were cast via reality television (2:15). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'LEGALLY BLONDE' This nonstop sugar rush of a musical about a powder puff who finds her inner power broker, based on the 2001 film, approximates the experience of eating a jumbo bag of Gummi Bears in one sitting. Flossing between songs is recommended (2:20). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley)
 'MAURITIUS' Ersatz Mamet -- ''American Buffalo,'' to be exact. Theresa Rebeck's deftly formulaic drama about a power struggle over a rare stamp collection has the feeling of an expertly drawn blueprint on tracing paper. Doug Hughes directs a tasty cast that includes Alison Pill, Bobby Cannavale and F. Murray Abraham (2:00). Biltmore Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'PYGMALION' David Grindley's misfired revival of Shaw's classic comedy pairs a de-sexed, infantile Henry Higgins (Jefferson Mays) with a hard-working but affectless Eliza Doolittle (Claire Danes). Chemistry? ''Not bloody likely,'' as Eliza would say. With excellent supporting performances from Boyd Gaines and Helen Carey (2:25). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley)
 'THE RITZ' This oddly inert revival of Terrence McNally's risque 1975 farce set in a gay bathhouse demonstrates that yesterday's dirt is often today's dust. But it does feature a delicious turn by Rosie Perez as a talentless chanteuse, and Kevin Chamberlin as the evening's much put-upon straight man. Joe Mantello directs.(1:55). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'ROCK 'N' ROLL' Tom Stoppard's triumphantly sentimental new play about love, revolution and really loud music, set in Prague and Cambridge, England. Directed by Trevor Nunn, and passionately acted by a cast that includes Rufus Sewell and Sinead Cusack, this production celebrates the enduring victory of the wayward human heart over fixed political doctrine (2:45). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'SPRING AWAKENING' (Tony Award, best musical 2007) Duncan Sheik and Steven Sater's bold adaptation of the Frank Wedekind play is the freshest new musical Broadway has seen in some time. Set in 19th-century Germany but with a ravishing rock score, it exposes the splintered lives of adolescents just discovering the joys and sorrows of sex. Performed with brio by a great cast, with supple direction by Michael Mayer and inventive choreography by Bill T. Jones (2:00). Eugene O'Neill Theater, 230 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'XANADU' An improbably entertaining spoof of the majestically awful movie from 1980 about a Greek muse (Olivia Newton-John, roller-skating into oblivion) who inspires a young artist in Venice Beach, Calif., to chase his disco dream. Kerry Butler mimics Ms. Newton-John's Aussie accent and sports her signature skates-and-leg-warmers look, but also puts her own affectionate stamp on a seriously silly role. The impish playwright Douglas Carter Beane, who wrote the adaptation, also supplies great material for the domineering comic actresses Jackie Hoffman and Mary Testa. Blissfully idiotic, practically sublime (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 Off Broadway
 'THE BROTHERS SIZE' Loosely based on West African myths, this impressive and emotionally absorbing debut by Tarrell Alvin McCraney portrays two battling brothers in Louisiana (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. (Jason Zinoman) 
 'CROSSING BROOKLYN' The events of Sept. 11 still resist easy synthesis into the stuff of life and art; this musical about two schoolteachers coping with post-traumatic stress several months after the attacks demonstrates this both deliberately and by example. The music, by Jenny Giering, often manages to create the jagged, nervous energy of the post-9/11 world; but the book, by Laura Harrington, lapses into formulas, and the piece, even despite the good direction of Jack Cummings III, has more rough edges than its creators might have intended (1:40). The Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette) 
 'DIE MOMMIE DIE!' A happy play about haute homicide in Beverly Hills, written by Charles Busch, who also portrays the irresistibly evil has-been heroine. Mr. Busch manages to summon an entire host of over-the-hill screen sirens from the twilight of Hollywood's golden age (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: RUDE AWAKENING' The 25th-anniversary version of Gerard Alessandrini's invaluable index to current American musicals has priceless moments (especially its parody of the hot-and-bothered antics of ''Spring Awakening''). But it's also a sobering reminder that even an inspired satirist can be defeated by emaciated targets (1:30). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 
 'FRANKENSTEIN' This dreary musical slog through the Mary Shelley novel, with an ill-used Hunter Foster in the title role, is not to be confused with the uptown spoof from Mel Brooks. It won't be (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood) 
 'THE GLORIOUS ONES' An energetic new musical by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens about a commedia dell'arte troupe in which bawdy shenanigans of yore are combined with the sweet sentiments of traditional American musical comedy. It's like a whoopee cushion that emits a wistful sigh (1:40). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'FUERZABRUTA' A sensory bath aimed at clubgoing college kids in search of cultural diversion. Thumping techno music, smoke and a standing throng surround you as you watch a curious collection of semi-spectacular technical feats (1:05). Daryl Roth Theater, 101 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'GONE MISSING' A delightful revival of the Civilians' revue of songs and monologues about lost shoes, cellphones, jewelry and maybe an illusion or two. The sharp young company brings energy and wit to both the collagelike text, composed of odd tales of dispossession, and Michael Friedman's eclectic cavalcade of pastiche songs. Brisk, funny and clever (1:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood)
 'HAMLET' The Wooster Group's sometimes ravishing, often numbing homage to a fabled theatrical event: Richard Burton on Broadway as the Prince of Denmark in 1964. Juxtaposing a film of the performance with live actors, who replicate the on-screen action, the production teeters between hypnotic and narcotic. Elizabeth LeCompte directs (3:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8750. (Brantley) 
 'HOODOO LOVE' The playwright Katori Hall appears to have a strong and promising voice. But she is still working out how to articulate what she wants to say, and this uneven play is definitely a step along the way to an arrival that is still in the future. Ms. Hall casts a sprawling net around the story of an aspiring blues singer in 1930s Nashville, hauling in a fair number of cliches, some rather arbitrary plot points and some strong moments when the singer, Toulou, follows the man she loves, evades her no-account brother and turns to her elderly neighbor for some hoodoo help that ends up creating tragedy for all. Oddly, in a play that purports to be about music, the music is somewhat of an afterthought (2:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Midgette) 
 'JUMP' Video game theater from Korea mixes martial arts and broad comedy with lowbrow results (1:30). Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Zinoman) 
 'LUCY' An occasionally provocative drama, about a mother who must learn how to take care of her autistic daughter, that takes on difficult issues and explores them without sentiment (1:45). The Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman) 
 'MASKED' A powerful play about three Palestinian brothers torn by the dilemma of accommodation or resistance to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. Written by an Israeli, the play is a thoughtful and sobering drama that avoids political statements or moral judgments (1:25). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Wilborn Hampton) 
 'MILK-N-HONEY' This frequently entertaining primer on food politics is partly fiction and partly based on interviews with people like farmers, Dumpster divers and food chemists. The show has an appealing sense of mission, but it too earnestly wants to convince us that we are prisoners of American consumerism. On the plus side, you get candy (1:25). 3LD Art and Technology Center, 80 Greenwich Street, at Rector Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 388-7371. (Rachel Saltz) 
 'MY FIRST TIME' Ken Davenport's venture into Web-theater synergy mines a site called MyFirstTime.com to cull stories of inaugural encounters with sex. Four actors deliver the anecdotes in what amounts to little more than a crassly commercial effort to replicate the success of ''The Vagina Monologues'' (1:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Ginia Bellafante)
 'NONE OF THE ABOVE' An uneven revival of a slight comedy that wants to be taken seriously. There are some clever one-liners, but much of the humor is of the sitcom variety. A bigger problem in this staging is a lack of chemistry between the play's two characters (1:45). Lion Theater on Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200. (Hampton) 
 'OHIO STATE MURDERS' LisaGay Hamilton plays the alter ego of the playwright Adrienne Kennedy in this short, sharp, hypnotic play about the specter of racism blighting the life of a college girl in the 1950s. A rare chance to encounter one of the most distinctive American voices of the last half-century (1:05). Theater for a New Audience at the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010. (Isherwood) 
 '1001' This contemporary, kaleidoscopic gloss on the ''1001 Nights'' tales is lively but lacks freshness (1:50). The Nagelberg Theater at the Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Caryn James)
 'THE OVERWHELMING' J. T. Rogers's smart and honorable drama about blundering Americans in Rwanda presents a sprawling panorama of perspectives on a nation in turmoil. Fluidly directed by Max Stafford-Clark, the production never quite evokes lives that are real instead of representative (2:20). Laura Pels Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (Brantley) 
 'THE OXFORD ROOF CLIMBERS REBELLION' An excellent play about two famous soldier-scholars -- T. E. Lawrence and Robert Graves -- and their disillusionment with the British establishment over World War I, particularly the government's attempts to ennoble the slaughter known as the Great War. Although set in Oxford University in 1920, the play is as timely as today's newspaper (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Hampton) 
 'POLITICAL IDOL' Uneven but at times hilarious, this musical revue satirizing the presidential primaries does to politics what ''Forbidden Broadway'' does to theater (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 352-3101. (James)
 'THE RECEPTIONIST' The ever-wonderful Jayne Houdyshell answers phones, gossips and gives motherly advice in an office where disturbing work is afoot. Adam Bock's play, essentially a gloss on the ''Twilight Zone'' formula, is a zippy hour and change of comedy and suspense (1:10). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center, Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. 
 (Isherwood) 
 'THE RISE OF DOROTHY HALE' Myra Baistow has fashioned an intriguing but uneven look at the real-life case of Dorothy Hale, a minor actress with important friends (including Harry Hopkins, adviser to President Franklin D. Roosevelt), who fell to her death from the Hampshire House on Central Park South in 1938. The case has eerie parallels to the Marilyn Monroe story (1:45). Theater at St. Luke's, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Neil Genzlinger) 
 'THE SENSUOUS WOMAN'Margaret Cho headlines an oddball burlesque review that mixes stand-up comedy (mostly gay) and stripping (a little of everything). Raunchy but only intermittently fun (1:30). Zipper Factory, 336 West 37th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Isherwood) 
 'SIVE' The Irish Rep throws itself away on this clunky 1959 melodrama about a schoolgirl married off to a rich old man (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737. (James) 
 'SPAIN' Jim Knable's wobbly fantasy stars Annabella Sciorra as an abandoned wife working through her emotional problems in an unusually colorful way. She dreams up a conquistador, played with savory wit by Michael Aronov, to give her tips on getting through life's battles (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)
 'SPEECH AND DEBATE' Stephen Karam's modest dark comedy about three misfit high school students, which includes a singing, dancing tribute to ''The Crucible,'' is funny, cliche-free and brilliantly performed (1:45). Black Box Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (James) 
 'THREE MO' TENORS' Great opera it ain't, but there's kitschy fun and not too much that's cringe-inducing in this diverse musical vehicle for black tenors (2:00). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Claudia La Rocco) 
 'TINGS DEY HAPPEN' An engrossing one-man show about the Fulbright year its author and performer, Dan Hoyle, spent in Nigeria; in the spirit of theatrical journalism, it is at once a travelogue, a cultural survey and a good introductory course in oil politics. But it is the people the audience meets who raise the exercise above a guided tour (1:25). Culture Project, 55 Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 352-3101. (Hampton) 
 'VENGEANCE' Ron Fitzgerald's ''Rats,'' featuring a terrific performance by Michael Mosley as an unemployed adman with an unexpected visitor, is the high point of this entertaining bill of five new short plays, presented by stageFarm. Gina Gionfriddo's ''Squalor'' takes a skewed look at the search for Internet pedophiles, and ''Specter,'' by Neena Beber, is a daffy take on a certain record producer named Phil. Five actors do it all, impressively (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444. (Genzlinger) 
 'WALMARTOPIA' This time-traveling musical satire is an uneasy mix of an earnest, power-to-the-workers message and blunt satire, positing an Orwellian future ruled by Wal-Mart. The music is a pastiche of styles, ranging from a Peter Allen conga line to gospel, but Cheryl Freeman's energetic performance as a put-upon Wal-Mart employee rises above it all (2:00). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 307-4100. (James)
 Off Off Broadway
 'DRUM OF THE WAVES OF HORIKAWA' What happens when you cross punk with Kabuki? In this production by the Theater of a Two-Headed Calf and the Here Arts Center, directed by Brooke O'Harra, you get something loud (duh), lively and exploratory that is also something of a mishmash. The music, by the talented Brendan Connelly, is consistently interesting. But the play, an adaptation of a 1705 Monzaemon Chikamatsu work, seems more burlesqued than illuminated by its encounter with punk. Here Arts Center, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101. (Saltz) 
 'A GLANCE AT NEW YORK' Axis Company's daffy resurrection of this lowbrow stage work from 1848 seems, at 50 minutes, to go by in a heartbeat, and when it's over, you'll have no sense of what made the play so popular way back when. But you'll have been entertained by the company's assaultive delivery. The story involves a rube who comes to New York and is fleeced repeatedly, and a fireman named Mose who punches people (1:00). Axis Theater, 1 Sheridan Square, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101. (Genzlinger) 
 'ODE TO THE MAN WHO KNEELS' Richard Maxwell, one of the few truly original theater auteurs to emerge from the past decade, has created a bleak, droll and strangely beautiful musical about cowboys and the women who hurt them (1:15). Performing Garage, 33 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 966-3651. (Brantley) 
 'THINGS ARE GOING TO CHANGE, I CAN FEEL IT' This unfocused multimedia piece about the '60s and politics feels like a student thesis. The Tank @ Collective Unconscious, 279 Church Street, Tribeca, (212) 352-3101. (James)

 Last Chance
 'BLACK WATCH' Gregory Burke's transfixing play from the National Theater of Scotland, inspired by interviews with soldiers who served in Iraq, is a glorious reminder of the transporting power of the theater. John Tiffany directs this seamless, haunting mix of drama, song and dance (1:50). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)
 'CRY HAVOC' This portrait of a couple in crisis is East versus West culture-clashing at its least credible (2:10). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)
 'A FEMININE ENDING' Sarah Treem's play is about an oboe player and aspiring composer trying to choose between pursuing a career and marriage to a pop star. An outmoded concept treated with minimal truthful detail. With Marsha Mason and Richard Masur as kooky parents (1:30). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)
 'THE JOKE' Two comics working the Catskills in the 1960s and '70s gradually go in different directions, putting strains on their partnership, reminiscent of a doomed marriage, in this well-conceived two-hander by Sam Marks. Thomas Sadoski and Jordan Gelber play it with admirable verve (1:10). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-4500; closes on Saturday. (Genzlinger) 
 'THE MISANTHROPE' The experimental Belgian-born director Ivo van Hove goes for the guts in this production, turning Moliere's courtly hypocrites into a wallowing, rutting, howling menagerie of beasts. Less a deconstruction than a detonation, but it does allow the excellent Bill Camp to find the tragic anguish in the title role (1:50). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)
 'TWELFTH NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD' William Shakespeare is gored in this one-joke satire, which, admittedly, has a pretty good joke (1:15). Teatro La Tea, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, Lower East Side, (800) 838-3006; closes on Saturday. (Zinoman)

HEADLINE: Sotheby's Hurt by Weak Auction Sales

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Shares of Sotheby's fell 28 percent yesterday, a day after sales figures from its Impressionist and modern art auction in New York painted a lackluster picture that prompted fears of a slowdown in the art market. 
 With a total take of just under $270 million, the auction at Sotheby's fell far short of even its low presale estimate of $355 million.
 William F. Ruprecht, the chief executive of Sotheby's, said in early October that record sales at its Chinese art auction in Hong Kong showed that global art markets were strong and would emerge unscathed from American market volatility.
 The international auction house's stock price had dropped by more than a third after the credit crunch in July and August on concerns that its wealthy clients would have less money to spend on art. But the stock rebounded to reach a 52-week high of $61.40 on Oct. 11.
 A JMP Securities analyst, Kristine Koerber, said the credit squeeze might not have directly affected Sotheby's clients, but potential bidders might have been wary of a potential economic slowdown. She downgraded the stock to market perform from market outperform.
 At Wednesday's auction, several prominent works, including the van Gogh landscape ''Wheat Fields,'' painted just before the artist's death, went unsold, and top works by Gauguin and Picasso sold below estimates. Of the 76 lots on offer, 20 failed to find buyers.
 Sotheby's officials said the results were more a reflection that estimates for the value of the works had been too high rather than a sign of trouble in the art market.
 Shares of Sotheby's sank to an intraday low of $30.80 yesterday. They ended regular trading down $14.23, at $35.84.

HEADLINE: They Are Lions, Hear Them Roar

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE

DATELINE: ALLEN PARK, Mich., Nov. 8 

 BODY:
When the Lions' Shaun Rogers rumbled with the intercepted football and his estimated 360 pounds toward the Ford Field end zone last Sunday, he was heading directly toward Harley Duke, who rose to his feet to cheer.
 Duke, 53, is a season-ticket holder in the first row of the upper deck of the end zone. He has seen many good and not-so-good Detroit Lions moments at Tiger Stadium, the Pontiac Silverdome and Ford Field in downtown Detroit.
 But Duke had never witnessed a defensive tackle sprinting 66 yards while stiff-arming a would-be tackler at the 10 yard-line before belly-flopping over the goal line in a 44-7 victory over Denver that left the Lions a surprising 6-2 at midseason.
 ''It was comical, this monster of a guy, and how cool, too,'' Duke, who works as a mill grinder in a steel plant, said. ''A play like that! And the Lions with a 6-2 record. It's kind of hard to believe.'' 
 The Lions begin the season's second half Sunday as an underdog at Arizona (3-5). They still must play the Giants, Green Bay (twice) and Dallas. Could the Lions -- 50 years from their last N.F.L. title -- really be good or is this merely another tease?
 ''The young fans are fired up, but the older guys are kind of holding off,'' Duke said. ''So I'm not jumping on the bandwagon yet. I've seen this before, and then the Lions just rip your heart out.''
 Perhaps skepticism is merited for a team with one playoff victory since 1957. Rogers anchors a defense that leads the league in takeaways (24). On offense, the leader is Jon Kitna, a 35-year old quarterback who arrived last season as a vagabond backup.
 Coach Rod Marinelli also started here last season. Marinelli, then 56, had never been a head coach. He was hired by Matt Millen, the team president who, until lately, was reviled by fans.
 Millen, through a team official, declined an interview request. The Lions finished 3-13 last season to make Millen's record 24-72 in his first six seasons with four coaches.
 But Marinelli began to establish a sense of stability. He emphasized it by putting in the middle of the locker room a 750-pound Michigan fieldstone that weighs more than twice as much as Rogers.
 On the boulder's base are the words Pound the Rock. On top of it is another message: Not good enough. Jason Hanson, the veteran place-kicker, explained: ''You pound the rock until you break it.'' Kitna, speaking of Marinelli, said: ''Every guy in here will probably fall on a sword for that guy. He has no ego.''
 Some of his players might have more pride, but their individual statistics are nothing to brag about. Kitna ranks seventh in the quarterback ratings and Hanson is tied for seventh in scoring, but no Detroit runners or pass receivers are among the top 10.
 Roy Williams, ranked 20th in yardage among receivers, said the Lions' offense is ''under the radar right now.'' He warned against overconfidence, specifically citing how the Giants started last season 6-2 before finishing 8-8.
 ''Teams are going to gear up for us,'' Williams said. ''Our goal is 10 wins. That will put us in the playoffs.'' The figure is often cited because Kitna, before the season, surprisingly said he would be disappointed with less.
 Kitna is a religious man who wears a baseball cap backward with the words In His Grip on it. His locker is decorated with posters and drawings promoting Christianity. All this made his Halloween costume somewhat surprising.
 At a charity party, Kitna dressed as a naked man, wearing a bodysuit and a thong, to spoof the defensive line coach, Joe Cullen, who pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct last year after driving nude through a pickup lane at a fast-food restaurant. In a statement issued by the team last week, Cullen said he was not offended by Kitna's costume. 
 Another recent off-field incident involved Rogers. He is being sued in Wayne County (Mich.) Circuit Court by a stripper who accused him of groping her without permission last June. Her lawyer, William McHenry, said Thursday, ''It's criminal sexual conduct.''
 The Wayne County prosecutor's office, however, did not charge Rogers with a crime. Rogers will be deposed in the civil case in a few weeks. Rogers's lawyer, Matthew Leitman, said Thursday, ''We've denied all allegations of wrongdoing.''
 Rogers rarely speaks to reporters but did a group interview for about two minutes Wednesday. He answered several questions by saying his team is 6-2 before walking away.
 On Thursday, Rogers walked around the locker room clicking together two black sticks. He is a seven-year veteran who was suspended four games last season after testing positive for a prohibited substance.
 ''It is more fun than it has been for a while,'' Rogers said Wednesday. ''There's always been a lot of talk. Most of the time, it's negative.'' Other teammates and his coaches are more verbal.
 Joe Barry, the defensive coordinator, said Thursday that Rogers weighs 360 pounds, not the 340 listed on the roster. He called Rogers's interception return the greatest thing ''my two eyes have witnessed'' in football.
 Barry said Detroit's defensive linemen are ''the pistons that are going to drive our engine.'' Defensive end Dewayne White has five and a half sacks and returned a fumble 3 yards for a touchdown last Sunday.
 Kitna recalled facing Rogers from the other side of the line when Kitna played for Cincinnati. ''Do not make him mad,'' Kitna said. Dominic Raiola, the center, recalled watching Rogers dunk a basketball after a 360-degree spin.
 Raiola sounded cautious when noting that the team's two defeats had been on the road at Philadelphia (56-21) and Washington (34-3). ''They weren't losses,'' he said. ''They were blowouts.''
 But it is hard for players and fans to temper their optimism. In a region where unemployment is high, the housing market is reeling and the automobile industry is struggling, sports are a primary form of entertainment.
 T. J. Duckett, a running back who grew up in the state and played at Michigan State, spoke of his family in Kalamazoo.
 ''It's crazy for me to see them so excited, and it's not because I'm on the Lions,'' he said. ''It's because they just like the Lions. Everyone's been dissing them for so many years.''
 Duckett said he grew up watching the traditional Thanksgiving game from Detroit, even when the Lions were not a good team, and said how important that national exposure could be this season when the Packers visit.
 Jeff Backus, an offensive tackle who played at Michigan, talked of how the Pistons and the Red Wings have won championships in recent years and of how the Tigers reached the 2006 World Series.
 ''The other three pro sports have played really well,'' Backus said. ''It's up to us to bring up the football end of it. We're trying.''

HEADLINE: Rapidly Rising Global Demand for Oil Provoking New Energy Crisis

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
With oil prices approaching the symbolic threshold of $100 a barrel, the world is headed toward its third energy shock in a generation. But today's surge is fundamentally different from the previous oil crises, with broad and longer-lasting global implications.
 Just as in the energy crises of the 1970s and '80s, today's high prices are causing anxiety and pain for consumers, and igniting wider fears about the impact on the economy. 
 Unlike past oil shocks, which were caused by sudden interruptions in exports from the Middle East, this time prices have been rising steadily as demand for gasoline grows in developed countries, as hundreds of millions of Chinese and Indians climb out of poverty and as other developing economies grow at a sizzling pace. 
 ''This is the world's first demand-led energy shock,'' said Lawrence Goldstein, an economist at the Energy Policy Research Foundation of Washington. 
 Forecasts of future oil prices range widely. Some analysts see them falling next year to $75, or even lower, while a few project $120 oil. Virtually no one foresees a return to the $20 oil of a decade ago, meaning consumers should brace for an era of significantly higher fuel costs.
 At the root of the stunning rise in the price of oil, up 56 percent this year and 365 percent in a decade, is a positive development: an unprecedented boom in the world economy. 
 Demand from China and India alone is expected to double in the next two decades as their economies continue to expand, with people there buying more cars and moving to cities to seek a way of life long taken for granted in the West. 
 But as prices rise, the global economy is entering uncharted territory. The increase so far does not appear to be hurting economic growth, but many economists wonder how long that will last. ''These prices are too high and will end up hurting everybody, producers and consumers alike,'' said Fatih Birol, chief economist at the International Energy Agency.
 Oil futures closed at $95.46 on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, down nearly 1 percent from the day before. But the price has become volatile, and many analysts expect the psychologically important $100-a-barrel threshold to be breached sometime in the next few weeks.
 ''Today's markets feel like the crowds standing up in the final minutes of a football game shouting: 'Go! Go! Go!,''' said Daniel Yergin, an oil historian and the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm. ''People seem almost more relaxed about $100 than they were about $60 or $70 oil.''
 Oil is not far from its historic inflation-adjusted high, reached in April 1980 in the aftermath of the Iranian revolution. At the time, oil jumped to the equivalent of $101.70 a barrel in today's money. 
 For most of the 20th century, as it transformed the modern world, oil was cheap and abundant. Throughout the 1990s, for example, oil prices averaged $20 a barrel. Even at today's highs, oil is cheaper than imported bottled water, which would cost $180 a barrel, or milk, at $150 a barrel.
 ''The concern today is over how will the energy sector meet the anticipated growth in demand over the longer term,'' said Linda Z. Cook, a board member of Royal Dutch Shell, the big oil company. ''Energy demand is increasing at a rate we've not seen before. On the supply side, we're seeing it is struggling to keep up. That's the energy challenge.'' 
 More than any other country, China represents the scope of that challenge. As it turned into a global economic behemoth over the last decade, China also became a major energy user. Its economy has grown at a furious pace of about 10 percent a year since the 1990s, lifting nearly 300 million people out of poverty. But rapid industrialization has come at a price: oil demand has more than tripled since 1980, turning a country that was once self-sufficient into a net oil importer. 
 India and China are home to about a third of humanity. People there are demanding access to electricity, cars, and consumer goods and can increasingly afford to compete with the West for access to resources. In doing so, the two Asian giants are profoundly transforming the world's energy balance. 
 Today, China consumes only a third as much oil as the United States, which burns a quarter of the world's oil each day. By 2030, India and China together will import as much oil as the United States and Japan do today. 
 While demand is growing fastest abroad, Americans' appetite for big cars and large houses has pushed up oil demand steadily in this country, too. Europe has managed to rein in oil consumption through a combination of high gasoline taxes, small cars and efficient public transportation, but Americans have not. Oil consumption in the United States, where gasoline is far cheaper than in Europe, has jumped to 21 million barrels a day this year, from about 17 million barrels in the early 1990s.
 If the Chinese and Indians consumed as much oil for each person as Americans do, the world's oil consumption would be more than 200 million barrels a day, instead of the 85 million barrels it is today. No expert regards that level of production as conceivable.
 More realistically, global demand is expected to rise to about 115 million barrels a day by 2030, a level that is likely to tax the world's ability to pump more oil out of the ground. Already, the world is running on a limited cushion of spare capacity; any interruption in supplies, whether from hurricanes or armed conflict, causes prices to spike. 
 ''We don't have any shock absorbers,'' Mr. Goldstein said. 
 For oil companies, high prices have set off a frenzied search for new sources around the world. After a long lull in investments through most of the 1990s because of low prices, major oil companies have invested billions of dollars to bring in more supplies.
 The trouble is that these big new developments take a long time, and companies have been hobbled by higher costs. The cost of drilling rigs, for example, the basic tool of the trade, has doubled in recent years. Analysts say it will take time, but new supplies will eventually work their way to market. 
 Supplies have also been hampered by political tension in the Persian Gulf, the war in Iraq, devastating hurricanes in the oil-producing Gulf of Mexico, production difficulties in Venezuela and violence in Nigeria's oil-rich province. Many of these geopolitical factors have contributed to a political risk premium variously estimated at $25 to $50 a barrel. Recently, in just nine weeks, oil jumped from $75 to $95 a barrel for little apparent reason.
 ''Fifty-dollar-a-barrel oil seems so far away at this point,'' said Thomas Bentz, a senior energy analyst at BNP Paribas in New York, citing a figure that seemed an impossibly high price for oil only a few years ago. ''Oil will stop rising when we see demand destruction. We haven't seen that yet.''
 When will it happen? Veterans of the oil business, having lived through booms and busts, say no one should count on oil rising forever. Economic slowdowns in China or the United States -- or especially, in both -- would probably send prices tumbling. 
 It happened a mere decade ago, after the Asian financial crisis sent economies there into a tailspin. Global oil prices fell by half, from $20 a barrel to $10, in months.
 ''It would be a big mistake to think the laws of supply and demand have been abolished,'' Mr. Yergin said.

HEADLINE: Stores See Shoppers In Retreat

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Consumers have rendered a verdict on the coming holiday season: grim. 
 From discounters like Wal-Mart to luxury emporiums like Nordstrom, the nation's biggest chains reported the weakest October in 12 years yesterday.
 The stores cited two main forces for the troubles: deepening economic jitters and unseasonably warm weather across the country, which left few consumers in the mood to buy. 
 The performance has set the stage for deep discounts in November and December as stores scramble to clear out unsold racks of clothing and electronics. 
 Sales at stores open at least a year, a crucial yardstick in retailing, rose just 1.6 percent last month, the slowest growth since October 1995, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers. The poor results -- on the heels of a dismal September -- have made this one of the worst fall shopping seasons in decades.
 ''Retailers are running from this fall like it was the plague,'' said John D. Morris, a senior retail analyst at Wachovia Securities.
 Wal-Mart Stores, the nation's largest retailer and a bellwether for the industry, said sales rose a meager 0.7 percent last month, even after the company lowered prices on toys and electronics to drum up business. 
 Anticipating a consumer spending slowdown, the company has now introduced steep doorbuster discounts -- like a $400 laptop -- every weekend until Thanksgiving.
 Even so, Wal-Mart predicted sales growth could be flat for November. 
 Midprice department stores did not fare much better last month. Sales fell 1.8 percent at J. C. Penney and 3.8 percent at Kohl's, two chains that have produced strong performances all year. 
 In a sign of things to come, both Kohl's and Penney's held storewide sales last weekend, with discounts of up to 50 percent. 
 Even higher-end stores struggled in October. Sales fell 1.5 percent at Macy's and 2.4 percent at Nordstrom and 7 percent at Dillard's. 
 ''There is big-time trading down going on,'' said Bill Dreher of Deutsche Bank Securities, referring to the phenomenon of consumers' turning to lower-priced stores because of financial insecurity.
 ''Nordstrom customers are trading down to Macy's, and the Macy's customer is trading down to Target,'' he said.
 That may account for strong sales at stores known for cheap chic -- fashionable clothing and home decor at steep discounts. For example, sales rose 4.1 percent at Target and 3 percent at TJX, the parent company of TJMaxx and Marshall's. 
 Luxury chains remained largely immune to the slowdown, with sales at Saks rising 10.6 percent. 
 The warm weather throughout October appears to have tamped down demand for clothing at the mall. Sales fell 3 percent at American Eagle Outfitters, 6 percent at Limited, 8 percent at Gap and 10.6 percent at Chico's FAS, the adult women's clothing chain. 
 Mr. Morris, who covers mall-based clothing chains, said several had begun cutting back on orders for the holidays, lest they become stuck with racks of unsold sweaters and coats. 
 The chains said that as the weather grew cooler, business was likely to improve, perhaps sharply this month. But an industry trade group, the National Retail Federation, is still predicting holiday season sales will rise 4 percent, the slowest in five years. 
 With oil prices soaring, the housing market slumping and the stock market in flux, there is little optimism that this will be a stellar season. 
 ''Our customers are clearly facing headwinds that are impacting both sentiment and discretionary spending levels,'' said the chief executive of J. C. Penney, Myron E. Ullman III.
 And he does not expect the conditions to improve anytime soon. ''We expect the challenging retail environment to continue for the foreseeable future,'' Mr. Ullman said.

HEADLINE: Fuel Without the Fossil

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: DENVER 

 BODY:
Mitch Mandich proudly showed off his baby, a 150-foot contraption of tanks, valves, hoppers, augers and fans. It hissed. It gurgled. An incongruous smell wafted through the air, the scent of turpentine.
 Mr. Mandich's machine devours pine chips from Georgia and turns them into an energy-rich gas, a step toward making liquid fuels. His company, Range Fuels, is near the front of the pack in a technology race that could have an impact on the way America powers its automotive fleet, and help ameliorate global warming.
 ''Somebody's going to hit a home run here,'' Mr. Mandich said. ''We want to be first.''
 For years, scientists have known that the building blocks in plant matter -- not just corn kernels, but also corn stalks, wood chips, straw and even some household garbage -- constituted an immense potential resource that could, in theory, help fill the gasoline tanks of America's cars and trucks. 
 Mostly, they have focused on biology as a way to do it, tinkering with bacteria or fungi that could digest the plant material, known as biomass, and extract sugar that could be fermented into ethanol. But now, nipping at the heels of various companies using biological methods, is a new group of entrepreneurs, including Mr. Mandich, who favor chemistry.
 They believe techniques borrowed from oil refining and other chemical industries will allow them to crack open big biological molecules, transforming them into ethanol or, even more interesting, into diesel and gasoline. Those latter fuels could be transported in existing pipelines and burned in existing engines without fuss. Advocates of the chemical methods say they may be flexible enough to go beyond traditional biomass, converting old tires or even human waste into clean transport fuel.
 In Madison, Wis., a company called Virent Energy Systems is turning sugar into gasoline, diesel, kerosene and jet fuel, with the long-range plan of obtaining the sugars from biomass. In Ontario, Dynamotive Energy Systems is turning biomass into a form of oil, and in Chicago, a Honeywell subsidiary called UOP is doing something similar. In Irvine, Calif., BlueFire Ethanol is using acid to break down organic material for conversion to fuel.
 Possibilities like these are coming to the fore at a time when rising oil prices have created an incentive to develop substitute fuels. Making them from biomass would be environmentally friendly in that, unlike standard gasoline or diesel, the fuels would not take long-stored carbon from underground and dump it into the air as carbon dioxide. 
 And unlike making ethanol from corn kernels, these techniques do not require significant amounts of natural gas or coal. Carbon dioxide, emitted in large volume when people burn fossil fuels, is the primary culprit in global warming.
 Lately, these factors have resulted in a flood of investment capital into both biological and chemical techniques for using biomass. Experts consider both approaches promising, and they say it is too early to tell which will win.
 ''It's not obvious, and I don't think it will be obvious for a very long time,'' Andrew Karsner, the assistant secretary of energy for energy efficiency and renewable energy, said in Washington. His department is awarding grants to support both approaches.
 Experts say it is possible that more than one type of plant will reach commercial success, with the ideal technique for a given locale depending on what material is available to convert to fuel.
 Range Fuels favors pine chips and other waste from softwood logging operations, largely because there is so much of it. Logging in Georgia, for instance, leaves behind about a quarter of the tree. ''Bark, needles, cones, we use all of it,'' said Mr. Mandich, chief executive of Range.
 Range is a privately held company whose chief scientist, Bud Klepper, has been working on the two problems, creating gas from biomass and then converting it to liquid fuel, since the 1980s. The company is heavily backed by Vinod Khosla, a Silicon Valley venture capitalist who has turned his focus to energy investments.
 Range broke ground this week on the first full-scale biomass-to-fuel plant in the United States, in Soperton, Ga. ''Today marks the beginning of a new phase of our effort to make America more energy secure,'' the secretary of energy, Samuel Bodman, said at the event. The plant, its cost not publicly disclosed, is expected to produce 20 million gallons of ethanol a year, with more capacity to be added later.
 In Georgia alone, enough waste wood is available to make two billion gallons of ethanol a year, Mr. Mandich said. If all that material could be captured and converted to fuel, it could replace about 1 percent of the nation's gasoline consumption. 
 Biomass of various types is abundant in every state, some of it gathered daily by garbage trucks. A study two years ago by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory found that enough biomass is available in the United States to replace more than a third of the nation's gasoline consumption, assuming the economics can be made to work.
 The Bush administration is counting on biofuels to help limit the growth of petroleum demand, and environmentalists routinely include such fuels in their forecasts as a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. But to date, no one has shown that fuels from biomass can be made profitably, even when competing with gasoline at $3 a gallon.
 Daniel M. Kammen, director for the renewable and appropriate energy laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley, said, ''I suspect we will have a trickle'' of fuels from biomass in the next few years. But it will be only a trickle unless the government adopts quotas or offers additional support, he said.
 Companies like Range that are trying to convert biomass by chemical methods follow one of two broad approaches. The first is to mix the material with steam to produce a gas known as synthesis gas, consisting of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. With additional processing, that gas can be converted to liquid fuels. The second technique does not break the material down as far, creating a product that resembles oil that can then be refined into liquid fuel.
 Research papers and patents are flying these days as scientists struggle to improve these methods. As with oil refineries, the final stages typically produce a variety of chemicals, of varying value, and the trick is to maximize production of the desirable chemicals. ''Everybody is dealing with a byproduct they don't want,'' said Arnold Klann, the chief executive of BlueFire.
 Range Fuels is one of the companies that turn biomass into a gas before converting it to liquid fuel. The company wants to make ethanol, a form of alcohol, but its technique produces less valuable varieties of alcohol as well. Company scientists are tweaking their approach to maximize the ethanol yield.
 The other day, laboratory technicians grabbed samples of a yellow liquid emerging from the machinery and swirled it like a suspect vintage of chenin blanc. An expensive chemical analyzer called a gas chromatography machine stood in the corner. By using it, engineers can calculate what changes in temperature, pressure and flow rates would work best to produce ethanol in a full-scale commercial venture.
 Overseeing the operation, Mr. Mandich radiated confidence. ''You can't have so many people at bat without hitting something,'' he said.
 As the nation seeks to develop new types of fuel, Congress has leaned heavily toward ethanol made from corn kernels, and it is the only alternative fuel available today in large volume. Ethanol benefits from a tax break and a mandate that a significant amountof it be blended into gasoline.
 Turning biomass into gasoline would be simpler, requiring no changes in the nation's cars or pipelines, but federal policy is tilting many research programs toward ethanol.
 Range, for instance, could make any of several types of fuel from its pine chips. Asked whether the company chose ethanol for the 51-cent-a-gallon tax break, Mr. Klepper declared: ''It's the American way.''

HEADLINE: Bush Loyalist Now Sees a White House Dangerously Soft on Iran and North Korea

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
The White House's effort to challenge Iran's nuclear ambitions has been hobbled by ''four and a half years of failed diplomacy.'' Its policy regarding North Korea is a dangerous fraud. It is pursuing an improbable Palestinian-Israeli peace at the expense of its stance against proliferation in the Middle East.
 And that from a longtime Bush loyalist: John R. Bolton, the conservative lawyer who until less than a year ago was President Bush's proudly unwavering ambassador to the United Nations. 
 Mr. Bolton, long viewed by liberal critics as a villain on the Bush team, has since emerged as the administration's most outspoken critic from the right, rebuking his former boss in interviews, in op-ed articles and now in a book. For a man who rushed to Florida in 2000 to join the Bush campaign's legal fight during the disputed vote recount, the disappointment sounds personal. 
 ''I didn't spend 31 days in Florida,'' he said, ''to end up where we are now.'' 
 Mr. Bolton's criticisms reflect a growing unease among some conservatives that a weakened White House chastened by the war in Iraq is abandoning core principles in pursuit of a more moderate policy of negotiations. 
 ''You see this at the end of every administration,'' said Representative Peter Hoekstra, Republic of Michigan, who criticized the administration's talks with North Korea to dismantle its nuclear weapons program. 
 With Representative Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, another staunchly conservative Republican, he recently wrote an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal, calling on the administration to disclose information about a reported Israeli airstrike in September against a site in Syria that was suspected of being a nuclear facility that North Korea was equipping.
 ''I'm going to watch very carefully what they do in North Korea,'' Mr. Hoekstra said in a telephone interview. ''I'm going to watch what they do with the Israelis and the Palestinians and the Syrians.''
 Mr. Bush's turn to a more pragmatic policy coincided with the departure of some of the administration's most hawkish officials and the ascendancy of Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state. Now, some of the debates that once occurred behind the administration's closed doors are taking place in public. ''I thought the policy had been moving in the wrong direction for quite some time,'' Mr. Bolton said of his decision to leave when his recess appointment expired with the last Congress at the end of December. (The White House discussed keeping him on, though it was clear that the Senate would never confirm him as ambassador.)
 ''Not only was it moving in the wrong direction, it was going to continue in the wrong direction no matter what I did,'' he continued during a recent interview at the American Enterprise Institute, the conservative perch to which he returned. ''So in the cost-benefit calculus of being in the government, I just felt that on policy terms I could do more outside the government than within.''
 When Mr. Bolton stepped aside, Mr. Bush called his departure a disappointment, and for an administration sensitive about criticism, it has turned out to be one. When Mr. Bolton's name came up in a recent conversation, an administration official who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly recalled, the president curtly responded, ''Interesting guy,'' and changed the subject. 
 Mr. Bush's press secretary, Dana Perino, would say only, ''He has a huge amount of respect for John Bolton.''
 On the foreign policy crisis of the day, the state of emergency in Pakistan, Mr. Bolton argued that Mr. Bush was naive to call on Pakistan's president, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, to hold elections. He said elections in Pakistan would risk instability -- perhaps even an Islamic government with a nuclear arsenal. 
 ''While Pervez Musharraf might not be a Jeffersonian democrat, he is the best bet to secure the nuclear arsenal,'' he said.
 Mr. Bolton's book -- ''Surrender Is Not an Option: Defending America at the United Nations and Abroad'' (Threshold Editions) -- is no kiss-and-tell screed against Mr. Bush and his team, though he recounts with relish his conflicts with colleagues and rivals at the United Nations and in the State Department. 
 He describes disputes that pitted his conservative faction against the ''high minded,'' those who, in his view, have seized control of not only the media, Congress, the State Department and the United Nations, but now also of the White House. 
 ''They picked up some allies among Bush's political appointees, distracted a few, and seduced others,'' Mr. Bolton writes about Mr. Bush's decision to negotiate with North Korea. 
 ''They whispered to the press against the infidels in the new administration who advocated a harder line. They even watched a few of their own go over the side, but they always persisted. And in the Seventh Year, Bush and his team rested. The bureaucracy's persistence prevailed so overwhelmingly that Bush himself did not even realize it.''
 Mr. Bolton, who served first as the State Department's chief arms control official, argues that the administration has abandoned the unilateralist strategy it followed at the beginning when it bolted from the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement that limits the emissions of greenhouse gases from most industrialized countries; ''unsigned'' the agreement that created the International Criminal Court and abrogated the Antiballistic Missile Treaty. 
 He says that only a fundamental change in government, not negotiations, will divert Iran and North Korea from the nuclear path.
 ''They are not going to give up their nuclear weapons voluntarily,'' Mr. Bolton said in the interview. ''They might be forced to give up their nuclear weapons, but that is not the policy that we're pursuing. So the consequence of the policy is that it won't achieve the stated objective and it will have the effect of legitimizing and reinforcing two fundamentally illegitimate regimes.''
 He said North Korea's apparent assistance to Syria in the construction of what analysts and officials said was a nuclear reactor showed that the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il, was already violating its pledge in February to dismantle its nuclear weapons program even though the administration points to a recent trip by Americans to a North Korean nuclear reactor to begin disabling the facilities.
 In the case of Iran, Mr. Bolton said: ''I think this is a very difficult question that has to be very carefully thought out. The choice is not between the world as it is today and the use of force. The choice is between the use of force and Iran with nuclear weapons.''
 Mr. Bolton's disenchantment mirrors that of fiscal conservatives who publicly questioned the White House's budget policies, especially before Mr. Bush began to veto spending bills approved by the Democratic-controlled Congress. 
 One of those conservatives, Bruce Bartlett, an economist who wrote a book called ''Impostor: How George W. Bush Bankrupted America and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy,'' said that criticism from the right had the effect of making the administration seem more moderate. But it also makes Mr. Bush seem more isolated. 
 In the current presidential campaign, the leading candidates for the Republican nomination are, arguably, even more hawkish than Mr. Bush on a host of issues, especially Iran.
 Mr. Bartlett suggested that on the most pressing issues -- terrorism and the war in Iraq -- Mr. Bush had not yet lost the core of the Republican Party but that criticism like Mr. Bolton's reflected an intraparty struggle as the Bush presidency neared an end. 
 ''I don't think you can transform support for Iraq into support for a more aggressive response to Iran,'' Mr. Bartlett said. ''People like John are trying to make that happen.''

HEADLINE: Trade Accord Reopens a Rift By Democrats

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Has the Democratic Party gone soft on trade? Or has it opened a bitter internal split that could come back to haunt the party in the coming elections?
 Under the Bush administration, trade deals submitted for approval to Congress have generally been opposed by labor unions, environmental groups and left-of-center activists hostile to the forces of globalization. Democrats, as a result, have rarely given their approval.
 But on Thursday, only a year after the Democrats regained control of Congress following a campaign rife with criticism of White House trade policies, nearly half the Democrats in the House broke with recent party orthodoxy and supported a trade deal with Peru that the administration hopes could lead to approval of significantly bigger and more important trade pacts in the future. 
 The Peru deal was approved by an overwhelming vote of 285 in favor to 132 against. But its most striking aspect was that 109 Democrats voted yes and 116 voted no, reopening the fissure that developed during the Clinton administration, when much of the party bucked President Bill Clinton as he pressed for the North American Free Trade Agreement and liberalizing trade with China.
 To the surprise of many Democrats, the House Speaker, Nancy Pelosi, led her fellow party members to vote yes, and even she found it paradoxical. ''Frankly, I have largely been on the other side of it than I am tonight,'' Ms. Pelosi told colleagues Wednesday evening at the end of a rancorous debate, during which many Democrats accused her of betraying the party's base. 
 The victory was sweet for the Bush administration, which points to the advantages of trade competition and wants to build up the export sector now that it is the strongest part of the economy. But many Democrats argue that lowering trade barriers has helped lose three million manufacturing jobs since 2000 and has resulted in stagnant wages.
 Two developments have led to the Democratic rupture over Peru. First, Ms. Pelosi and other Democrats won concessions from the Bush administration to include protections for workers and for the environment in Peru, and by extension in trading-partner countries in future trade deals. With these attachments, Ms. Pelosi said the Peru deal was not perfect but still worthy.
 Second, the Democrats are riding high politically and getting sizable campaign contributions from the sectors that are benefiting the most from the global economy. These include financial services firms, computer chip makers and other high-tech manufacturers, the entertainment industry and farmers dependent on selling to markets overseas.
 A split among the Democratic presidential candidates, who receive support from unions but also from export-oriented industries, mirrors the disagreement in Congress. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois endorses the Peru deal, which is due to come before the Senate this year, while former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina opposes it as part of his populist anti-establishment campaign.
 Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York said on Thursday that she would vote for the Peru deal, but she has sent mixed signals on the overall issue. . She has asked, for example, for a review of the North America trade agreement negotiated by her husband, and she said she would vote against several coming trade accords.
 Yet she is also surrounded by former officials from the Clinton administration who are ardently pro-trade, including former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin.
 The old Clinton hands, who argue that differences in education levels and advances in technology, not trade, are the main reason for wage stagnation or job losses, say they are confident that Senator Clinton's instincts are in the pro-trade mold. These Democrats also call for more domestic spending on job training and preserving benefits for workers who do lose their jobs to imports.
 ''I think if a Democratic president comes in, Democrats will take a broader view of trade than Democrats can in Congress right now,'' said Stuart E. Eizenstat, an under secretary of state for economic affairs under Mr. Clinton. ''I would expect that a Democratic president will be able to win more trust from Democrats in trade, though maybe not from most of them.''
 The accord with Peru would allow its exports into the United States duty-free and would eliminate duties on most industrial and farm exports from the United States to Peru. 
 Opponents of open trade say that because it was so bitter, the Peru vote may actually make future votes more difficult and the path of a future Democratic president more doubtful.
 President Bush and his top aides hailed the approval of the Peru deal on Thursday and called on the same bipartisan cooperation to get behind pending deals on Panama, Colombia and South Korea.
 It is far from clear, however, that the support for Peru will carry over to those deals or others.
 The Panama deal is stalled, for example, because a top legislative leader there is wanted for murder of an American soldier. Democrats say they cannot support a deal with Colombia until it substantially reduces the killings of labor leaders and other dissidents there. The Korea deal is widely opposed because it does not provide access to American beef and because of fears by auto workers and some automakers that it would inundate the United States with Korean cars and trucks.
 ''The Peru vote has to be taken with a grain of salt,'' said Clayton Yeutter, a former top trade envoy under President Ronald Reagan. ''Of the four pending agreements, this one was the easiest for the leadership and the membership. It is not that big of an agreement, and they can use it to demonstrate some bona fides in favor of trade agreements.''

HEADLINE: Judge Deals Transit Union A Blow on Collecting Dues

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN; Diane Cardwell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
In scolding language, a state judge refused yesterday to allow the Transport Workers Union to begin automatically collecting dues again from its members, saying he did not find believable the union leaders' assertions that it would not strike again.
 The ruling by Justice Bruce M. Balter of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn was a blow to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which had urged that the ban on automatic dues collection -- imposed after a 2005 strike -- be lifted for the sake of labor harmony. 
 It was also a victory for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who has continued to denounce the union for the 60-hour strike in December 2005, which disrupted the city and forced millions of people to walk, bike or find other ways to get to work. The city's chief lawyer had asked the judge this month to keep the penalty in place. 
 ''I think that you have a union here that was unwilling to make a commitment that they wouldn't strike,'' Mr. Bloomberg said. ''You cannot have somebody breaking the law, that puts the people of this city in physical danger and destroys, and has the potential of really hurting the entire economy. So I was very pleased at the judge's ruling, but I wasn't surprised.'' 
 The ability to deduct dues directly from members' paychecks is highly important to the union, which has said its collections have declined more than $1 million because of the inability to make the deductions.
 The court imposed the dues penalty last year after ruling that the strike violated the state's Taylor Law, which bars public-sector unions from striking. The dues checkoff, as the automatic payment is known, was taken away in June. 
 The court said the union could seek to have the dues checkoff reinstated if it no longer claimed the right to strike against the authority. 
 In late September, Roger Toussaint, president of the union's Local 100, submitted an affidavit in which he acknowledged that the Taylor Law barred strikes by government employees. And using language taken from the statute, he said that ''the union does not assert the right to strike.'' 
 But that was not enough for Justice Balter, who said that Mr. Toussaint's affidavit ''merely parrots the statutory language.'' He called it ''patently insufficient'' and said it ''lacks credibility.''
 The judge said he recognized the importance of peace between labor and management, but he said it was outweighed by the potential damage of another strike. 
 The union has struck three times since 1966 and threatened strikes on two other occasions. ''The court requires assurances that defendants will not engage in a future strike that will impede in the functioning of the City of New York,'' the judge wrote. 
 He agreed with the city that an affidavit from Mr. Toussaint alone would not be enough. He said that to regain the dues checkoff, Mr. Toussaint and every other member of the local's executive board must submit affidavits ''which state in unequivocal terms that Local 100 lacks the right to strike'' against a government agency.
 The union said it would appeal. 
 ''Today's decision by Judge Balter is wrong,'' Mr. Toussaint said in a written statement. ''Unfortunately, this matter has become a political football.''
 There are 48 people on the local's executive board, including Mr. Toussaint. Since the dues checkoff was halted in June, the union has asked members to pay dues voluntarily. But the results have been only partly successful, and dues collections from June through August resulted in a $1.1 million shortfall. 
 The authority said in a statement that it remained committed to building a productive relationship with the union. 
 But Joshua B. Freeman, a professor of labor history at the graduate center of the City University of New York, said Justice Balter's ruling could undermine that goal.
 ''I think it's extremely unusual for a judge to essentially block the agreed effort by both management and workers to resolve a labor dispute and put it behind them,'' Mr. Freeman said.

HEADLINE: Blame for Poor Home Sales? It's the Press, a Builder Says

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The housing market is horrible in most parts of the country, says the chief executive of the luxury home builder Toll Brothers, and he fears it will not get better until the newspapers stop saying how bad it is.
 Toll Brothers, which has operations in 22 states, said yesterday that it expected to take a write-down of $250 million to $450 million because of declining land values when it reports results for the quarter that ended Oct. 31. The company said sales for the quarter fell 36 percent, to $1.17 billion, and that customers backed out of 39 percent of their orders, the highest rate ever.
 Robert I. Toll, the chief executive, handed out grades for 37 markets that the company operates in, and most got a mark of F or worse. 
 ''The fact that I differentiate between F, F-minus and F-minus-minus'' shows just how bad things are, he told analysts during a conference call. He said those grades ''go from miserable to outright purgatory.''
 The lowest grade went to Las Vegas and Tampa, Fla.
 ''Perhaps as the presidential campaign heats up and moves to the front page, negative articles about housing will move off the front page,'' he said. ''Then, hopefully, the positive underpinnings of low interest rates, low unemployment and a decent economy will raise new-home-buyer confidence.''
 The company said many of the canceled home purchases were for its more expensive homes. The average price of new orders in the quarter was $646,000, but the average price of canceled orders was $788,000.
 He said a survey of Toll customers who canceled contracts showed that only 11 percent reported trouble getting mortgages. More either had personal financial problems or were unable to sell the homes they already owned. ''People who just wanted to walk'' accounted for 17 percent of the cancellations, he said.
 ''Translation, they've read one too many Times articles, and decided now is not the time to buy a home,'' he said.
 Nearly all the decent grades went to markets in and around New York City, while some of the worst grades were given to once-hot second-home markets.
 The best grade, B-plus, went to Toll's ''city living'' apartment projects in the New Jersey suburbs of New York, while similar projects in the city received a B, as did Princeton, N.J., and the states of Delaware and Connecticut. The suburban New York counties of Dutchess and Putnam, which he views as one market, earned a C-plus.
 The F-minus grade went to the vacation communities of Hilton Head, S.C.; Palm Springs, Calif.; the Maryland shore; and the Poconos area of Pennsylvania, as well as to Michigan and Atlanta. 
 The F grade was the one most often given, going to Arizona, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Minnesota and Southern California outside of Palm Springs. The cities of Chicago; San Antonio; Charlotte, N.C.; and Reno, Nev., got the same mark, as did the eastern and northern parts of Florida. Mr. Toll noted that Minnesota had improved to get its grade up to an F.
 Another area that has improved, he said, was the western part of Florida, which moved up to a C, although he said that might reflect Toll's aggressive price cuts. He also awarded C's to the Texas cities of Austin and Dallas. Colorado got a C-minus.
 Raleigh, N.C., fell to D-plus, while D's were given to most of New Jersey and to Northern California, as well as to Washington and its Maryland suburbs, and the Philadelphia suburbs. D-minus was the grade for West Virginia and central Florida, including Orlando.
 Mr. Toll said the downturn was worse than the one in the early 1990s, adding ''the growth in the rate of cancellations, the decline in new contracts, and the weaknesses we observed in October suggest that we still have tough times ahead.''

HEADLINE: City Offers Coney Island Plan That Conflicts With a Developer's

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg unveiled his administration's long-awaited proposal for revitalizing Coney Island yesterday with a zoning plan that he said would create the nation's largest urban amusement park, promote the development of stores and 4,500 apartments along Surf Avenue and preserve historic attractions like the Parachute Jump.
 The proposed rezoning, which covers 19 blocks and 47 acres from the New York Aquarium west along the oceanfront to Highland View Park, would transform an area pockmarked with empty lots and seedy buildings that still manages to attract millions of visitors every summer to the beaches, a ballpark and assorted attractions from roller coasters to sword swallowers. 
 ''It really could be spectacular,'' Mayor Bloomberg said yesterday after a speech outlining the plan to the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce. ''But it's fallen on hard times.'' 
 The city's plan could create a standoff with Joseph J. Sitt, a shopping center developer who said he had spent more than $120 million buying 10 acres in the heart of Coney Island's frayed amusement district. 
 Mr. Sitt, chief executive of Thor Equities, has promoted his own $1.5 billion plan for a new amusement district, which bears some similarities to the city's vision. But it diverges from the city's plan by including hotels, time-shares and an enormous indoor water park. City officials contend that housing in the proposed 15-acre amusement district would lead to an inevitable clash over noise, late hours and swirling lights.
 Mr. Sitt, who has until recently been very vocal about his differences with the city, released a statement yesterday expressing disappointment with the mayor's presentation. The statement said he was still optimistic that a deal could be reached among landowners, the city and the community.
 Mr. Sitt, who has insisted that hotels and time-share units are required to make the project economically viable, vowed to continue working with the Bloomberg administration and other elected officials ''to do what's best for the people of Coney.''
 But his conciliatory tone belies the rising tension between him and City Hall. Deputy Mayor Daniel L. Doctoroff has sought since June to get Mr. Sitt to agree to a land swap, in which he would trade his property for a city-owned parcel on the north side of the nearby baseball stadium, KeySpan Park. Mr. Sitt has refused, saying the properties are not comparable in value.
 Mr. Doctoroff said yesterday that the city wanted to find an experienced, world-class amusement park operator to run the district, which is ''a very different business than building a shopping center.''
 ''He doesn't have the experience to do it,'' Mr. Doctoroff said, adding that the city expected Mr. Sitt to play a role in building housing or retail just outside the amusement park.
 But some officials and community groups fear that Mr. Sitt could initiate a lawsuit, or let his land sit idle until Mayor Bloomberg leaves office and, presumably, a more amenable replacement succeeds him. 
 City Councilman Domenic M. Recchia Jr. said he had been working with city officials and the City Council to resolve the dispute; he has been supportive of Mr. Sitt.
 The city's proposed zoning plan, which was devised in consultation with the Coney Island Development Corporation and community leaders, would ultimately establish a nearly 50-acre park, from the site of the Steeplechase ride to Asser Levy Park.
 The plan divides the 19 blocks into three distinct areas. The first, on the north side of Surf Avenue, from Stillwell Avenue to West 20th Street, would be zoned for up to 1,800 apartments and retail space. A second residential district would be created between West 19th and West 24th Streets, from the south side of Surf Avenue to the Boardwalk. Building heights would step down to the water.
 ''Coney East,'' the third district, would range from the east side of the ballpark to the Cyclone roller coaster and include a 15-acre amusement district. New streets would help improve the flow of traffic and pedestrians from Surf Avenue and the subway to the Boardwalk. The zoning there would allow for a hotel, a water park, enclosed amusements, catering halls, movie theaters, restaurants and bowling alleys along Surf Avenue, in an effort to make the area a year-round destination.
 Amanda Burden, the city's planning director, said the amusement park would be ''open, accessible and affordable,'' in keeping with Coney Island's populist history as the country's first resort.
 Charles Reichenthal, the longtime district manager of Community Board 13 in Coney Island, said the city's plan was ''on the right track,'' with a few things that have to be straightened out, including the fate of landowners like the Vourderis family, which runs Deno's Amusement Park and the Wonder Wheel, and Mr. Sitt of Thor Equities.
 ''If Thor Equities has done everything, it's put Coney Island back on the map,'' he said. ''We now get calls from people interested in doing all kinds of things out here. This plan's certainly on the right track, with some snags that have to be figured out.''

HEADLINE: An Abrupt Slide for Technology Shares

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Markets slumped for most of the day yesterday as technology stocks succumbed to the turmoil they had largely resisted in recent weeks. Stocks recovered in the final hour, but investors remained anxious as a shaky week on Wall Street neared its close. 
 The Dow Jones industrials finished down 0.3 percent, or 33.73 points, at 13,266.29, after spending much of the day deeper in the red. The benchmark index, which lost 360 points on Wednesday, dropped more than 200 points yesterday before climbing back in the final hour of trading. The broader market was virtually unchanged for the day, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropping 0.85 point, or 0.06 percent, to 1,474.77. 
 ''There was enough blood on the streets to finally entice buyers back into this market,'' said Ryan D. Larson, senior equity trader at Voyageur Asset Management. 
 But sinking technology stocks were out of luck. They battered the Nasdaq composite index, which fell 52.76 points, or 1.9 percent, to 2,696.00. The index was down as much a 3 percent. 
 It was a sudden downturn for technology companies, which have enjoyed a steady run-up in prices since the summer. Analysts said yesterday's sell-off was driven by a bout of profit-taking in an uncertain climate.
 Technology has been ''viewed as a safe haven in recent months,'' said Todd Salamone, director of trading at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''When a trade gets crowded, and there's disappointing news, you have a lot of traders running for the exits at the same time.''
 The losses were prompted by Cisco Systems, the networking company, which cautioned late Wednesday that its business could slow in the next few months. Cisco is viewed as a bellwether for the high-technology sector, and the market's punishment was swift: its shares dropped 8.9 percent. Similar losses hit I.B.M., Apple and other blue-chip technology companies. Even Google dipped more than 5 percent. 
 Investors remained skittish about economic troubles, from a lack of confidence in the credit market to the global ramifications of a weakening dollar and rising oil prices. Their concerns were underscored by remarks from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who testified yesterday to the Joint Economic Committee in Washington.
 Mr. Bernanke told members of Congress that the economy was likely to slow ''noticeably'' in the months ahead, as the housing recession and higher energy prices start to put pressure on consumers' willingness to spend.
 Mr. Bernanke predicted gloom but hinted that the Fed would be reluctant to cut its interest rates again before the end of the year. Still, investors who bet on interest rates raised their expectations of a cut at the Fed's December meeting.
 Big retail chains also reported a second month of weak sales growth yesterday, citing economic clouds that show no signs of lifting before the end of the year. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores and Macy's dropped on the news.
 Retail sales rose 1.9 percent in October, below industry estimates, according to Retail Metrics, a research firm, which said 70 percent of the retailers it tracks fell below their forecasts.
 Banks also continued to fall, with shares of Citigroup recording their eighth consecutive decline. But other brokerage firms, like Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase, showed modest gains. 
 Shares of Morgan Stanley, which announced a $3.7 billion write-down in the value of mortgage-related assets, rose nearly 5 percent as investors hoped that the bank had disclosed the last of its subprime woes. 
 ''It's a hackneyed expression that the market needs certainty,'' said Quincy Krosby, chief investment strategist at The Hartford financial firm. ''There's a reason it's hackneyed.''
 In a sign that the recent market turmoil is bleeding into the larger economy, shares of Sotheby's plunged 28.4 percent to a 52-week low. The auction giant held a disappointing sale of Impressionist and modern art Wednesday night that fell short of expectations, leading some to predict a tapering off of the robust art market.
 Following are the results of yesterday's auction of 30-year Treasury bonds:

HEADLINE: From Back of the G.O.P. Pack, Huckabee Is Stirring

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LUO

DATELINE: CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Mike Huckabee's field staff had expected a modest crowd for a campaign event at a tiny rural community college near here on Wednesday. But as people began to cram into the shoe-box-size room, campaign organizers scurried to roll back a dividing wall and set up extra chairs. 
 To the Huckabee campaign, it was another small note in a recent trickle of encouraging moments. His fund-raising is up, the campaign just received its first major Christian conservative endorsement and most of all -- to Mr. Huckabee's obvious delight -- opponents are beginning to take potshots at him.
 ''I've always said as a hunter, 'You never put the cross hairs on a dead carcass,''' Mr. Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, told reporters Wednesday. ''You only aim for something that's alive that you'd like to take home.'' 
 With less than two months until Iowa's first-in-the-nation caucuses, there are signs that Mr. Huckabee, a former Baptist pastor for whom Bible verses flow easily off the tongue, is charming, quipping and sermonizing his way from a long shot ensconced in the second tier of the Republican presidential sweepstakes to a possible contender here. 
 ''The candidate du jour right now is Mike Huckabee,'' said Chuck Laudner, executive director of the Iowa Republican Party. ''He certainly can win. It's still a wide-open race here in Iowa.''
 Even if Mr. Huckabee wins here, what that would mean over the course of the campaign is another question. He would be vastly underfinanced -- and underorganized -- going into a crush of contests in big and expensive states. A victory here would also put intense scrutiny on his record as governor, which has been largely ignored in the focus on his Republican rivals, Rudolph W. Giuliani, Senator John McCain of Arizona, Fred D. Thompson and Mitt Romney.
 Still, there is a new sense of possibility in the Huckabee campaign. It has been fueled in large part by evangelicals, including a politically active home-schooling population, dissatisfied with his better-financed competitors. Mr. Romney continues to lead state polls and has made significant inroads among Christian conservatives, but many are searching for an alternative. 
 On Thursday, Mr. Huckabee scored his first endorsement from a prominent Christian conservative leader, the Rev. Donald E. Wildmon, founder of the American Family Association. Meanwhile, Mr. Thompson, who is vying for the same conservative mantle, singled out Mr. Huckabee this week, calling him a ''pro-life liberal.''
 Mr. Huckabee fired back in an interview with Marc Ambinder, a political blogger. ''The Writers Guild is on strike, and Fred is kind of struggling to get some lines,'' he said. ''Whoever put that line together is writing for comedy and not for a serious political drama.''
 But other Christian conservative leaders have been reluctant to get behind Mr. Huckabee's campaign, in no small part because they worry that he cannot win the nomination, much less the general election. Beyond that, they wonder whether this former governor who has never served in Washington has the credentials to be a wartime president, and they fret that he does not have the resources to compete in 50 states against someone like Mr. Giuliani, a supporter of abortion rights whom many conservatives want to stop at all costs. Mr. Huckabee has depicted the leaders' lack of support as a source of strength, adding, ''some people have become more process-focused than they are principle-focused.''
 While Mr. Huckabee's fund-raising still badly trails that of his better-known rivals, as well as that of Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas, his campaign took in more than $1 million online in October, more than it raised in the entire third quarter. Most of the donations came in 10 days at the end of the month, on the heels of a strong debate performance, a rousing speech at the Values Voter Summit in Washington and, as Mr. Huckabee invariably inserts in interviews, an endorsement by Chuck Norris, the martial arts star. 
 In that period, the campaign saw Web site traffic jump to levels second among Republicans only to that of Mr. Paul, who has a strong base of Internet supporters, forcing it to upgrade its server three times. 
 Chip Saltsman, Mr. Huckabee's campaign manager, maps out a series of events, though somewhat short on details, of his candidate scoring a victory or strong second in Iowa that could earn him bushels of media coverage, then drawing on resources he has held back to compete in New Hampshire and South Carolina, where he says the campaign has built viable field staffs. 
 Mr. Saltsman predicts that other prominent contenders will fade, narrowing the field to perhaps two major candidates. After that, he said, the campaign could take advantage of money pouring in from the early momentum to compete in the crush of states holding primaries on Feb. 5. 
 Mr. Laudner said prospects beyond Iowa remained Mr. Huckabee's chief hurdle among politically savvy caucusgoers. ''If there isn't going to be enough money to compete beyond Iowa and New Hampshire,'' he said, ''that goes to the heart of the viability question. That's his No. 1 limit here.''
 Mr. Huckabee has a homespun approach that draws heavily on the story of his climb from humble roots -- a generation, he likes to say, from ''dirt floors and outdoor bathrooms'' to the governor's office, where he served for more than a decade in a largely Democratic state. He promotes a populist message that seeks to tap into the economic anxiety he says many working-class families feel.
 Conservative stances on social issues are at the center of his campaign, but he often tempers them with a declaration of the need to end the divisiveness plaguing the country. 
 He is one of few Republican candidates to speak out on environmental issues. He is an ardent proponent of the ''fair tax,'' which would scrap the national income tax for a national sales tax. He talks tough on securing the borders and refusing amnesty to illegal immigrants, but he championed a bill in Arkansas that would have made illegal immigrants eligible for in-state tuition and scholarships. 
 In short, he is difficult to categorize politically, even as he has sought to play up his conservative credentials for the primaries. 
 As he has begun to edge up in some polls, his rivals have seized on his record, accusing him of being soft on illegal immigration, which he denies. The fiscal group Club for Growth has attacked his fiscal conservative credentials for months and recently started a Web site, taxhikemike.org.
 For his part, Mr. Huckabee has thrown darts at his Republican rivals in a folksy manner, fueling speculation that he is really running for the vice presidency. 
 But some Republican critics in his home state say there is more below his affable exterior. 
 ''He, historically, has acted very thin-skinned,'' said Joe Yates, one of Mr. Huckabee's top advisers in the governor's office who does not support his candidacy. ''When somebody criticized him, he reacted.''

HEADLINE: History And Calumny

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Today, I'm going to write about a slur. It's a distortion that's been around for a while, but has spread like a weed over the past few months. It was concocted for partisan reasons: to flatter the prejudices of one side, to demonize the other and to simplify a complicated reality into a political nursery tale. 
 The distortion concerns a speech Ronald Reagan gave during the 1980 campaign in Philadelphia, Miss., which is where three civil rights workers had been murdered 16 years earlier. An increasing number of left-wing commentators assert that Reagan kicked off his 1980 presidential campaign with a states' rights speech in Philadelphia to send a signal to white racists that he was on their side. The speech is taken as proof that the Republican majority was built on racism. 
 The truth is more complicated.
 In reality, Reagan strategists decided to spend the week following the 1980 Republican convention courting African-American votes. Reagan delivered a major address at the Urban League, visited Vernon Jordan in the hospital where he was recovering from gunshot wounds, toured the South Bronx and traveled to Chicago to meet with the editorial boards of Ebony and Jet magazines. 
 Lou Cannon of The Washington Post reported at the time that this schedule reflected a shift in Republican strategy. Some inside the campaign wanted to move away from the Southern strategy used by Nixon, believing there were more votes available in the northern suburbs and among working-class urban voters.
 But there was another event going on that week, the Neshoba County Fair, seven miles southwest of Philadelphia. The Neshoba County Fair was a major political rallying spot in Mississippi (Michael Dukakis would campaign there in 1988). Mississippi was a state that Republican strategists hoped to pick up. They'd recently done well in the upper South, but they still lagged in the Deep South, where racial tensions had been strongest. Jimmy Carter had carried Mississippi in 1976 by 14,000 votes.
 So the decision was made to go to Neshoba. Exactly who made the decision is unclear. The campaign was famously disorganized, and Cannon reported: ''The Reagan campaign's hand had been forced to some degree by local announcement that he would go to the fair.'' Reagan's pollster Richard Wirthlin urged him not to go, but Reagan angrily countered that once the commitment had been made, he couldn't back out. 
 The Reaganites then had an internal debate over whether to do the Urban League speech and then go to the fair, or to do the fair first. They decided to do the fair first, believing it would send the wrong message to go straight from the Urban League to Philadelphia, Miss.
 Reagan's speech at the fair was short and cheerful, and can be heard at: www.onlinemadison.com/ftp/reagan/reaganneshoba.mp3. He told several jokes, and remarked: ''I know speaking to this crowd, I'm speaking to a crowd that's 90 percent Democrat.'' 
 He spoke mostly about inflation and the economy, but in the middle of a section on schools, he said this: ''Programs like education and others should be turned back to the states and local communities with the tax sources to fund them. I believe in states' rights. I believe in people doing as much as they can at the community level and the private level.''
 The use of the phrase ''states' rights'' didn't spark any reaction in the crowd, but it led the coverage in The Times and The Post the next day.
 Reagan flew to New York and delivered his address to the Urban League, in which he unveiled an urban agenda, including enterprise zones and an increase in the minimum wage. He was received warmly, but not effusively. Much of the commentary that week was about whether Reagan's outreach to black voters would work. 
 You can look back on this history in many ways. It's callous, at least, to use the phrase ''states' rights'' in any context in Philadelphia. Reagan could have done something wonderful if he'd mentioned civil rights at the fair. He didn't. And it's obviously true that race played a role in the G.O.P.'s ascent. 
 Still, the agitprop version of this week -- that Reagan opened his campaign with an appeal to racism -- is a distortion, as honest investigators ranging from Bruce Bartlett, who worked for the Reagan administration and is the author of ''Impostor: How George W. Bush Bankrupted America and Betrayed the Reagan Legacy,'' to Kevin Drum, who writes for Washington Monthly, have concluded. 
 But still the slur spreads. It's spread by people who, before making one of the most heinous charges imaginable, couldn't even take 10 minutes to look at the evidence. It posits that there was a master conspiracy to play on the alleged Klan-like prejudices of American voters, when there is no evidence of that conspiracy. And, of course, in a partisan age there are always people eager to believe this stuff.

HEADLINE: ESPN and Parks Help Lift Disney Income

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company reported a 12 percent rise in quarterly net income on Thursday largely from strong gains at ESPN. 
 The company, which delivered its fifth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth, also played down concerns that the troubled economy and the Hollywood writers' strike would drag down future results. 
 While economic factors ''could certainly impact our 2008 results, thus far our businesses remain strong, and we have not seen the effects of a downturn,'' said Thomas O. Staggs, the chief financial officer. He added that Disney was better positioned to weather a downturn than its rivals because of the strength of its brand. 
 Disney executives told analysts yesterday that they did not expect that lower consumer confidence would hurt the company's theme parks. As for the writers' strike, Disney said that its film studio would not feel any effects until 2009 and that it would seek to mitigate the more immediate effect on television by cutting costs. 
 ''We hope that we will be able to find a way to settle this difference and settle the strike before there is indelible damage done to the business,'' said Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive.
 For the fourth fiscal quarter, which ended Sept. 29, Disney reported net income of $877 million, or 44 cents a share, a 12 percent increase from $782 million, or 36 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Disney, reporting results after the market close, said net income for 2007 rose to $4.7 billion from $3.4 billion on revenue of $35.5 billion. Excluding one-time gains from the sale of its stakes in the E! Entertainment cable channel and Us Weekly, revenue jumped 24 percent a share.
 Revenue for the quarter was largely static -- $8.93 billion compared with $8.65 billion a year earlier -- in comparison with what had been a spectacular quarter of growth in 2006 across the company's studio, theme park and consumer products businesses. 
 ESPN was largely responsible for the climb in net income. Higher cable fees and advertising revenue at the sports television unit drove Disney's cable networks' operating income up 30 percent to $1.1 billion.
 The theme parks continued to sizzle after strong gains in recent quarters from the successful ''Year of a Million Dreams'' marketing campaign. Quarterly operating income in the unit increased 9 percent to $430 million.
 But Hong Kong Disneyland, suffering widening losses as attendance droops, continued to drag on the unit. The Hong Kong government, which previously said it would invest no more money in the park, reversed that position on Monday, saying it was weighing options. Disney said it would forgo royalties for now. 
 At the movie studio, fourth-quarter operating income dropped 21 percent to $170 million because the quarter a year ago included revenue from the smash ''Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest.'' 
 For the year, the studio benefited from stronger-than-expected results for the Pixar release ''Ratatouille.'' While the animated film underperformed some other Pixar hits in the United States, robust business overseas has driven cumulative ticket sales to nearly $600 million, Disney said.

HEADLINE: European Central Bank Chief Laments Euro's Climb

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank threw its weight Thursday behind attempts to rein in the euro, reflecting concern that the currency's ascent against the dollar is making life harder for European businesses.
 The bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, made his remarks after announcing that interest rates were being held steady amid continued turbulence in financial markets.
 ''In the recent period I have observed moves that I would say were undoubtedly sharp and abrupt,'' Mr. Trichet said. ''And I said already that brutal moves were never welcome.'' 
 In describing the euro's ascent as ''brutal,'' Mr. Trichet wheeled out a phrase he last applied to currency markets in November 2004, when the European common currency climbed to about $1.35 and stoked trans-Atlantic tensions. It demonstrates the central bank's unease with rapid currency gyrations -- which can derail contracts that have been signed as well as currency hedging for businesses.
 But the effectiveness of Mr. Trichet's remarks remains to be seen. The euro hovered near its record high above $1.46 on Thursday, settling later in New York unchanged from Wednesday at $1.4667. 
 Analysts pointed out that the bank's effort in 2004 to talk down the euro eventually bore fruit, although the unwinding of speculative bets against the dollar also played a role.
 ''Words like this may be a bit subtle for verbal intervention by a central banker,'' said Ken Wattret, chief euro-zone economist at BNP Paribas in London. ''Maybe it will become more important over time.''
 The bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4 percent, a stance it has maintained since canceling a planned increase in September when the credit markets were shaken by the mortgage lending crisis in the United States. The Bank of England also left its main rate unchanged, at 5.75 percent.
 Despite rising oil and food prices, the European Central Bank has apparently concluded that increasing borrowing costs at a time when many large banks are reeling from losses incurred through bets on mortgage-backed securities would be dangerous. 
 Still, Mr. Trichet is not hiding the bank's preference to tighten when markets calm down, and he repeated a promise to act ''in a firm and timely manner.''
 The European bank also announced Thursday that it would make two liquidity injections worth 115 billion euros ($169 billion) into the financial system, an apparent indication that it still regarded credit as being tighter than normal and that it was determined to nurse the markets back to regular functioning.
 The two operations, planned late this month and early in December, will extend the loans that it made as the credit market seized up in late summer.
 The bank's main task is to keep prices stable, and Mr. Trichet acknowledged that it had been caught off guard by a recent surge in overall inflation. But he said that a strong monthly jump in prices -- the reading in October ran at an annual pace of 2.6 percent, above the bank's comfort zone of just under 2 percent -- was likely to be an aberration as inflation declines by mid-2008.
 As is his custom, Trichet gave no indication that the European bank or other central banks might intervene in support of the dollar. He brushed off suggestions that the bank's policy of raising interest rates, which increases the appeal of euro-denominated assets, was exacerbating the dollar's weakness.
 Coming at a time when the Federal Reserve is cutting rates to bolster a softer American economy, some say that the European policy has probably amplified the trend toward a weaker dollar. 
 Mr. Trichet emphasized that the European Central Bank's mandate is to fight inflation. ''Each of us in our own environment did what was required by the situation,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Warns Of Worse Times In the Economy

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 8 

 BODY:
Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress on Thursday that the economy was going to get worse before it got better, a message that received a chilly reception from both Wall Street and politicians.
 On a day when stock prices swung wildly, the dollar hit another new low against the euro and further signs emerged from retailers that consumers are growing more cautious about spending, Mr. Bernanke warned that the economy was about to ''slow noticeably'' as the housing market continues to spiral downward and financial institutions tighten up on lending. 
 But in a disappointment to investors, Mr. Bernanke offered no signal that the central bank might soften the blow by lowering interest rates for a third time this year at its next policy meeting on Dec. 11. 
 Share prices, which plunged on Wednesday, went on a roller coaster after Mr. Bernanke testified. The Dow Jones industrial average first fell 205 points by midafternoon, but then clawed back most of the way and ended the day at 13,266.29, down just 34 points. 
 Testifying before the Joint Economic Committee, the Fed chairman said that the two rate cuts in September and October should be enough to keep the economy from slipping into a recession. Without being specific, he reinforced statements by other Fed policy makers that the economy would have to show signs of stalling out entirely before they would reduce rates again.
 Asked if he saw any risks of a recession, Mr. Bernanke demurred. ''We have not calculated the probability of a recession,'' he responded. ''Our assessment is for slower growth, but positive.''
 The Fed chairman's stance was similar to that of Henry M. Paulson Jr., the Treasury secretary. In a meeting Thursday with editors and reporters of The New York Times, Mr. Paulson predicted that the crisis in mortgage and credit markets would hurt growth but not lead to a recession. 
 ''I believe we will continue to grow,'' Mr. Paulson said. ''We have a diversified economy.''
 Mr. Bernanke's message did not sit well with Wall Street analysts, who quickly criticized him for ignoring the real risk of a serious downturn. And at least one Republican, Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, begged him at length to cut rates as soon as possible.
 But Fed officials are far from persuaded of the need, even though some now expect economic growth to slow to an annual pace of 1.5 percent or less in the final months of this year -- a drastic downshift from the rapid pace of almost 4 percent this summer.
 Mr. Bernanke offered a rocky outlook for the months ahead. He said the battered housing market had yet to hit bottom, that delinquencies and foreclosures were likely to rise and that the depression in home-building was ''likely to intensify.'' He predicted that personal spending would advance more slowly, because consumers were less confident and because of tighter credit conditions. 
 On top of all that, he said, ''further sharp increases in crude oil prices have put renewed upward pressure on inflation and may impose further restraint on economic activity.'' Oil traded just above $95 a barrel on Thursday, down slightly from the day before but still near its recent record highs.
 Despite all these worrying signs, Mr. Bernanke noted that the economic data since the Fed reduced interest rates last week ''continued to suggest that the overall economy remained resilient in recent months.'' 
 ''The cumulative easing of policy over the past two months should help forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy,'' he said. 
 Wall Street analysts and anxious investors took little comfort in the chairman's remarks. 
 ''Mr. Bernanke gave no ground to the market's desire for further easing,'' wrote Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
 But Mr. Shepherdson and a number of other analysts predicted that the economy would slow much more than Mr. Bernanke expects and force the Fed's hand.
 Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics in London, predicted that the economy would be ''stagnant at best'' in the final quarter of this year. 
 ''The only question is whether there is enough evidence of this slowdown available by mid-December -- or whether we will have to wait until January for the next cut,'' Mr. Ashworth wrote in a research note.
 David Rosenberg, Merrill Lynch's chief economist for the United States, predicted that the housing market would not hit bottom by the end of next year. Noting that the Fed chairman said he would ''act as needed,'' Mr. Rosenberg said Mr. Bernanke had left the door open to more rate cuts.
 At the hearing, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, urged Mr. Bernanke to act more aggressively to stimulate the economy. ''I'm very concerned that there may be a bigger storm on the horizon,'' he said. 
 But Mr. Bernanke refused to budge. Indeed, he referred first to the Fed's attention to ''price stability'' and second to its interest in ''sustainable growth.'' 
 That did little to cheer lawmakers. In an early sign of the political pressure that the Fed is likely to face if the economy falters next year, Senator Brownback, who recently abandoned his Republican campaign for president, pleaded with Mr. Bernanke to cut rates in time for the Christmas shopping season.
 ''It seems to me that now is the time,'' Mr. Brownback said. ''When those gas prices get up to $3 a gallon, it seems to hit some sort of psychological point in consumer's mind that 'I have less to spend,' and that's a reality for them.''

 BERNANKE'S FORECASTBen S.

In 1994, at age 20, he began buying and reselling foreclosed homes. By 2006 he had a BMW, a Corvette and a house worth $1.2 million. Now the market has collapsed, and he owes about $6 million. [A18.] 
 GRIM OCTOBER FOR RETAILERS The nation's biggest retail chains have reported the weakest October in 12 years. The stores cited two main forces for the troubles: deepening economic jitters and unseasonably warm weather across the country, which left few consumers in the mood to buy. [C1.] 
 RIO TINTO REJECTS RIVAL'S BID Rio Tinto rejected a bid by a rival mining company, BHP Billiton, calling it too low -- squelching for now what would have been one of the largest acquisitions in corporate history. BHP Billiton's options now include starting a hostile takeover bid. [C1.]

 Broadway
 'CURTAINS' This musical comedy about a musical-comedy murder -- featuring songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb and a book by Rupert Holmes -- lies on the stage like a promisingly gaudy string of firecrackers, waiting in vain for a match. The good news is that David Hyde Pierce, playing a diffident Boston detective, steps into full-fledged Broadway stardom. Scott Ellis directs a talent-packed cast that includes Debra Monk and Karen Ziemba (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200.
 (Ben Brantley) 
 'CYRANO DE BERGERAC' David Leveaux's disarming revival of Edmond Rostand's romantic classic is a double shot of silvery hokum, sweet but surprisingly potent. With an artfully low-key Kevin Kline in the title role and a captivating Jennifer Garner as his secret love, the show goes down so easily, you're drunk and misty-eyed before you know it (2:40). Richard Rodgers Theatre, 226 West 46th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Brantley) 
 'ROCK 'N' ROLL' Tom Stoppard's triumphantly sentimental new play about love, revolution and really loud music, set in Prague and Cambridge, England. Directed by Trevor Nunn, and passionately acted by a cast that includes Rufus Sewell and Sinead Cusack, this production celebrates the enduring victory of the wayward human heart over fixed political doctrine (2:45). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Brantley) 'XANADU' An improbably entertaining spoof of the majestically awful movie from 1980 about a Greek muse (Olivia Newton-John, roller-skating into oblivion) who inspires a young artist in Venice Beach, Calif., to chase his disco dream. Kerry Butler mimics Ms. Newton-John's Aussie accent and sports her signature skates-and-leg-warmers look, but also puts her own affectionate stamp on a seriously silly role. The impish playwright Douglas Carter Beane, who wrote the adaptation, also supplies great material for the domineering comic actresses Jackie Hoffman and Mary Testa. Blissfully idiotic, practically sublime (1:30). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)
 Off Broadway
 'THE BROTHERS SIZE' Loosely based on West African myths, this impressive and emotionally absorbing debut by Tarrell Alvin McCraney portrays two battling brothers in Louisiana (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555. 
 (Jason Zinoman) 
 'CROSSING BROOKLYN' The events of Sept. 11 still resist easy synthesis into the stuff of life and art; this musical about two teachers coping with post-traumatic stress several months after the attacks demonstrates this both deliberately and by example. The music, by Jenny Giering, often manages to create the jagged, nervous energy of the post-9/11 world; but the book, by Laura Harrington, lapses into formulas, and the piece, even despite the good direction of Jack Cummings III, has more rough edges than its creators might have intended (1:40). The Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 352-3101. (Anne Midgette) 
 'FRANKENSTEIN' This dreary musical slog through the Mary Shelley novel, with an ill-used Hunter Foster in the title role, is not to be confused with the uptown spoof from Mel Brooks. It won't be (2:10). 37 Arts, 450 West 37th Street, (212) 307-4100. (Isherwood)'THE GLORIOUS ONES' An energetic new musical by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens about a commedia dell'arte troupe in which bawdy shenanigans of yore are combined with the sweet sentiments of traditional American musical comedy. It's like a whoopee cushion that emits a wistful sigh (1:40). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, 150 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. (Isherwood) 
 'HAMLET' The Wooster Group's sometimes ravishing, often numbing homage to a fabled theatrical event: Richard Burton on Broadway as the Prince of Denmark in 1964. Juxtaposing a film of the performance with live actors, who replicate the on-screen action, the production teeters between hypnotic and narcotic. Elizabeth LeCompte directs (3:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 539-8750. (Brantley) 
 'HOODOO LOVE' The playwright Katori Hall appears to have a strong and promising voice. But she is still working out how to articulate what she wants to say, and this uneven play is definitelya step along the way to an arrival that is still in the future. Ms. Hall casts a sprawling net around the story of an aspiring blues singer in 1930s Nashville. Oddly, in a play that purports to be about music, the music is somewhat of an afterthought (2:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 239-6200. (Midgette) 
 'LUCY' An occasionally provocative drama, about a mother who must learn how to take care of her autistic daughter, that takes on difficult issues and explores them without sentiment (1:45). The Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101. (Zinoman) 
 'MILK-N-HONEY' This frequently entertaining primer on food politics is partly fiction and partly based on interviews with people like farmers, Dumpster divers and food chemists. The show has an appealing sense of mission, but it too earnestly wants to convince us that we are prisoners of American consumerism. On the plus side, you get candy (1:25). 3LD Art and Technology Center, 80 Greenwich Street, at Rector Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 388-7371. 
 (Rachel Saltz) 'OHIO STATE MURDERS' LisaGay Hamilton plays the alter ego of the playwright Adrienne Kennedy in this short, sharp, hypnotic play about the specter of racism blighting the life of a college girl in the 1950s. A rare chance to encounter one of the most distinctive American voices of the last half-century (1:05). Theater for a New Audience at the Duke on 42nd Street, 229 West 42nd Street, (646) 223-3010. (Isherwood) 
 '1001' This contemporary, kaleidoscopic gloss on the ''1001 Nights'' tales is lively but lacks freshness (1:50). The Nagelberg Theater at the Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, (212) 352-3101. (Caryn James)
 'THE OXFORD ROOF CLIMBERS REBELLION' An excellent play about two famous soldier-scholars -- T. E. Lawrence and Robert Graves -- and their disillusionment with the British establishment over World War I, particularly the government's attempts to ennoble the slaughter known as the Great War. Although set in Oxford University in 1920, the play is as timely as today's newspaper (1:30). Urban Stages, 259 West 30th Street, (212) 868-4444. (Hampton) 
 'POLITICAL IDOL' Uneven but at times hilarious, this musical revue satirizing the presidential primaries does to politics what ''Forbidden Broadway'' does to theater (1:30). Triad Theater, 158 West 72nd Street, (212) 352-3101. (James)
 'THE RECEPTIONIST' The ever-wonderful Jayne Houdyshell answers phones, gossips and gives motherly advice in an office where disturbing work is afoot. Adam Bock's play, essentially a gloss on the ''Twilight Zone'' formula, is a zippy hour and change of comedy and suspense (1:10). Manhattan Theater Club at City Center, Stage I, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212. 
 (Isherwood) 
 'SPAIN' Jim Knable's wobbly fantasy stars Annabella Sciorra as an abandoned wife working through her emotional problems in an unusually colorful way. She dreams up a conquistador, played with savory wit by Michael Aronov, to give her tips on getting through life's battles (1:40). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christo pher Street, West Village, (212) 279-4200. (Isherwood)
 'SPEECH AND DEBATE' Stephen Karam's modest dark comedy about three misfit high school students, which includes a singing, dancing tribute to ''The Crucible,'' is funny, cliche-free and brilliantly performed (1:45). Black Box Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300. (James) 'THREE MO' TENORS' Great opera it ain't, but there's kitschy fun and not too much that's cringe-inducing in this diverse musical vehicle for black tenors (2:00). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. (Claudia La Rocco) 
 'VENGEANCE' Ron Fitzgerald's ''Rats,'' featuring a terrific performance by Michael Mosley as an unemployed adman with an unexpected visitor, is the high point of this entertaining bill of five new short plays, presented by stageFarm. Gina Gionfriddo's ''Squalor'' takes a skewed look at the search for Internet pedophiles, and ''Specter,'' by Neena Beber, is a daffy take on a certain record producer named Phil. Five actors do it all, impressively (1:20). Cherry Lane Theater, 38 Commerce Street, West Village, (212) 868-4444.
 (Neil Genzlinger) 
 Last Chance
 'BLACK WATCH' Gregory Burke's transfixing play from the National Theater of Scotland, inspired by interviews with soldiers who served in Iraq, is a glorious reminder of the transporting power of the theater. John Tiffany directs this seamless, haunting mix of drama, song and dance (1:50). St. Ann's Warehouse, 38 Water Street, at Dock Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)
 'CRY HAVOC' This portrait of a couple in crisis is East versus West culture-clashing at its least credible (2:10). Abingdon Theater Arts Complex, 312 West 36th Street, (212) 868-4444; closes on Sunday. (Zinoman)
 'A FEMININE ENDING' Sarah Treem's play is about an oboe player and aspiring composer trying to choose between pursuing a career and marriage to a pop star. An outmoded concept treated with minimal truthful detail. With Marsha Mason and Richard Masur as kooky parents (1:30). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200; closes on Sunday. (Isherwood)
 'THE JOKE' Two comics working the Catskills in the 1960s and '70s gradually go in different directions, putting strains on their partnership, reminiscent of a doomed marriage, in this well-conceived two-hander by Sam Marks. Thomas Sadoski and Jordan Gelber play it with admirable verve (1:10). Studio Dante, 257 West 29th Street, Chelsea, (212) 239-4500; closes tomorrow. (Genzlinger) 
 'THE MISANTHROPE' The experimental Belgian-born director Ivo van Hove goes for the guts in this production, turning Moliere's courtly hypocrites into a wallowing, rutting, howling menagerie of beasts. Less a deconstruction than a detonation, but it does allow the excellent Bill Camp to find the tragic anguish in the title role (1:50). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 239-6200; closes on Sunday. (Brantley)

HEADLINE: Thompson Seeks to Alter Benefit Plan For Retirees

BYLINE: By MARC SANTORA

 BODY:
Fred D. Thompson, venturing into the treacherous political territory of changing Social Security, called yesterday for slowing the growth of benefits for future retirees by using a different yardstick on which to calculate the monthly payouts.
 Mr. Thompson said that annual increases in benefits for future retirees should be based on the cost-of-living index, not the wage index, as is done now. Since the price index typically rises more slowly then the wage index, this would likely slow the growth of benefits. The change would not apply to current retirees.
 He also called for allowing workers to divert 2 percent of their paychecks -- to be matched by the federal government -- into individual investments that are an ''add on'' to the Social Security program. But he did not recommend diverting existing payroll taxes into private accounts, as President Bush and conservatives have proposed. 
 To keep Social Security solvent over the long run, Mr. Thompson proposed a sharp break with the current policy of having the system financed entirely by payroll taxes on workers and their employers. He said he would use general tax revenues to help bolster the system.
 Because his plan would create a new pool of savings through 401(k)-style investment accounts, Mr. Thompson forecast that the economy and federal tax revenues would be larger than otherwise, and that it would therefore be justified to divert a portion of those additional tax revenues back into the retirement system.
 Mr. Thompson's plan, while missing many details, was more specific than what the Bush White House put on the table when it sought to overhaul the system. It also varied substantially from the traditional conservative approach of focusing primarily on personal investment accounts.
 ''There's no reason to run for president of the United States if you can't tell the American people the truth about complex issues like Social Security,'' Mr. Thompson, a Republican, said in a written statement announcing his proposals. ''As we speak, Congress is raiding the Social Security Trust Fund. If we don't act soon, the politicians in Washington will either repay those 'IOUs' through tax hikes or benefit cuts.''
 Unlike some Democrats running for president, Mr. Thompson said he opposed increasing Social Security taxes on high-income earners to help make the system solvent. He also did not propose raising the age at which citizens are eligible for full benefits; it is now gradually being phased toward 67.
 Mr. Thompson, a former senator from Tennessee, has made reining in entitlement costs a central theme of his campaign.
 In calling for private accounts, Mr. Thompson said he would like to allow workers who are not currently receiving Social Security benefits to invest in personal ''add-on accounts'' that would resemble 401(k) plans. Workers would be able to invest 2 percent of their monthly wages, matched by the federal government. Mr. Thompson is the only one of the Republicans running for the White House who has made Social Security a central theme of his campaign.
 There are political risks inherent in tackling the solvency of the program, with older voters particularly wary of changes to a system that they view as critical to their well-being.
 Mr. Bush saw his major push to overhaul Social Security fizzle under political pressure. He, too, proposed private savings accounts. Mr. Thompson said his plan was different in that the private accounts he is proposing are not only voluntary, but also an additional savings plan, not a replacement for Social Security.

 Re ''Baseball's Losing Formula,'' by Michael Lewis (Op-Ed, Nov. 3): 
 I suggest looking at two other formulas that need revision: 
 (1) An 8:21 p.m. starting time plus a four-hour game equals a post-midnight conclusion. 
 (2) A two-and-a-half-hour game plus one and a half hours of commercials equals a four-hour game. 
 ''Baseball like it oughta be'' means kids sneaking radios into school to listen to daytime World Series games and being able to stay awake for the final out, and broadcasts filled with anecdotes and name recognition of October heroes like Gibson and Gibson, not tacos and beer. 
 Why not a winning economic formula that fills seats for the love of the game, kids and all fans: earlier starting times, significantly reduced ticket prices and faster games? Jere Hochman
