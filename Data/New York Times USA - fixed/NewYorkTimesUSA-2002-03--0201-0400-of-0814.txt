HEADLINE: U.S. Productivity Growth Rate Revised Upward for 4th Quarter 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7 

 BODY:
American productivity grew at an even faster pace in the fourth quarter of last year than previously indicated, the Labor Department said today.
 Productivity, which is the amount of output for each hour of work, increased at an annual rate of 5.2 percent in the October-December quarter. That compares with the 3.5 percent pace previously reported and higher than Wall Street estimates of 4.5 percent. 
 A separate report from the Labor Department today showed that the number of Americans who filed new claims for unemployment insurance dipped last week, continuing an overall slide this year that indicates companies are easing layoffs as signs of economic recovery bloom.
Initial claims for jobless benefits for the workweek ended March 2 fell by a seasonally adjusted 5,000, to 376,000.
The more stable four-week moving average of claims, which smoothes out week-to-week volatility, sank last week to 372,750. That was the lowest level since Aug. 11, when claims stood at 372,000.
Also today, the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, offered his most optimistic assessment of the economy in more than a year, telling Congress that the country is now recovering from its first recession in a decade.
Because consumers kept buying throughout the slump, they will have less pent-up demand, he said. That means spending will probably not rise as quickly as in past rebounds, Mr. Greenspan said.
A report released today from the Federal Reserve showed that consumer borrowing surged in January. Total consumer credit outstanding rose $12.8 billion in January, to a seasonally adjusted $1.7 trillion, the Fed said. Economists had expected a $3.3 billion rise.
For the entire year, productivity increased just 1.9 percent compared with 3.3 percent in all of 2000.
The fourth-quarter improvement in productivity came at a price. Businesses responded to slumping sales by sharply cutting back their payrolls. Workers' hours in the fourth quarter fell at a 3.8 percent rate. That caused the total number of hours worked to drop at a faster pace than output -- creating a rise in productivity.

HEADLINE: New York's $20 Billion 

 BODY:
Yesterday, in a startling love fest with some normally cantankerous New Yorkers, President Bush delivered completely on his pledge of $20 billion to help the city rebuild -- and then improved upon it. Altogether the package of financial aid and tax credits does more than provide much-needed help to reconstruct Lower Manhattan. It represents a gesture of confidence in, and solidarity with, the entire New York region. 
 There was never much doubt that New York would eventually get the $20 billion that Mr. Bush initially pledged in a meeting last year with Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton. But the administration and some members of Congress clashed over how long it would take. Mr. Bush's budget director, Mitchell Daniels, had to apologize for using the term "money-grubbing" to describe New Yorkers' demand for the money right away. 
 Now Mr. Bush has reversed course. The administration came up with money for projects that would never have been eligible for federal emergency aid. The biggest pieces of the new package -- on top of more than $10 billion that has already been appropriated -- were $5 billion in tax credits to encourage businesses and residents to remain in New York, and $5.5 billion for other purposes, including a transit facility connecting PATH trains to the subway, liability insurance to construction contractors and restoration of energy and telephone lines. This last item will help spare New Yorkers an extra hit on their utility bills to pay for rebuilding Lower Manhattan's demolished infrastructure.
The only downside to the agreement yesterday was that the New York tax breaks were attached to a bill that contains other business tax cuts that could cost the states $14 billion in lost revenue over the next three years. Virtually every state is wrestling with budget shortfalls now, and almost none, including New York, can afford that much lost revenue. Congress needs to make up for this loss in coming months.
For now, however, congratulations are due to everyone involved in putting together the new package, including Mr. Bush, Gov. George Pataki, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Senators Schumer and Clinton and the New York Congressional delegation. There will be plenty of time to analyze how each of them will benefit politically from yesterday's happy scene. But when politics produces such welcome results, cynicism should give way to gratitude.

HEADLINE: Fed Chief Sees Decline Over; House Passes Recovery Bill 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, effectively declared the recession over today, saying a spate of recent economic news suggested that the recovery "is already well under way."
 His assessment, which was notably more upbeat and less hedged than his last public comments on the economy just eight days ago, was seconded by the Bush administration's chief economist, R. Glenn Hubbard. 
 "I think we do have a recovery under way," Mr. Hubbard, the chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, said at a news conference, where he predicted the rebound to be modest in the first half of the year, followed by a more pronounced upturn in the second half.
Hours after Mr. Greenspan's remarks, the House overwhelmingly passed a scaled-back version of legislation originally intended to help pull the economy out of recession but now recast by the two parties as an effort to deal with the aftermath and assure that the recovery takes hold. 
The bill would extend unemployment assistance for workers who have not found another job by the time their benefits run out, and would encourage companies to invest more in new factories and equipment, a provision that addresses one of the biggest remaining weaknesses in the economy.
The vote of 417 to 3 in the House suggested that the legislation has broad enough support to break the partisan deadlock that kept Congress from responding to the recession until it had apparently ended. The bill now goes to the Senate.
Final word on the recession's end will probably not come for months, while the National Bureau of Economic Research, the academic group that is the quasi-official arbiter of business cycles, continues to pore over data and waits to make sure the economy does not dip again.
The recession, which began last March but encompassed only a single quarter in which the economy actually contracted, now appears to have been one of the shortest and shallowest on record. Some economists have questioned whether it qualified as a recession at all. 
The economy grew at a 1.4 percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, defying predictions that it would remain knocked out after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11. Economists are projecting that growth in the first quarter will be at least that strong, and perhaps as high as 4 percent.
The judgment by the Fed and the White House that the economy is clearly on the mend could have widespread policy and political repercussions, affecting the course of interest rates, the debate over the budget surplus and tax cuts and the Congressional elections in November.
The decision by House Republican leaders to pass the pared-back economic package today was an early example of how the recovery is affecting political calculations. The bill, which amounted to a retreat by President Bush and House Republicans from their effort to enact a broader package of tax cuts. 
The Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, said he was encouraged by the House action but did not set a date for taking up the bill. Mr. Bush said he would sign it if it passed the Senate.
Speaking to reporters in the Rose Garden, Mr. Bush said he would "let the statisticians define what happened or what didn't happen" with the recession. He portrayed the House vote as a positive step for the economy rather than a setback for his tax-cutting agenda.
The economy "went through a massive slowdown, and people's lives were badly affected, and a lot of people were laid off," he said. "That's why the House did the right thing today, and the Senate now needs to act."
The House vote came after Mr. Daschle pressed Republicans for months to decouple their call for bigger tax cuts from an extension of unemployment benefits. The House had passed tax-cutting economic packages three times in recent months, but all of them died in the Senate, which responded by twice passing extensions of unemployment benefit payments.
To win Democratic support, Republican leaders stripped from the House bill many of the provisions dearest to Mr. Bush, including his call for an acceleration of individual income tax rate cuts. But they included a package of temporary corporate tax cuts that Republicans said was the minimum they could accept. 
The bill would extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks for many workers who lost their jobs in the last year and have exhausted their state-provided benefits, which typically last 26 weeks. In addition, it would increase the number of states eligible to add a second 13-week extension at federal expense. Among the states that would benefit from that provision are New Jersey, California and Illinois.
Some Democrats said the measure fell short of what was needed by continuing to exclude from unemployment benefits many part-time workers and those who had not worked for long enough to qualify for benefits before losing their jobs.
The bill would also allow companies to write off an additional 30 percent of their investments in new factories and equipment for the next three years. Democrats had previously supported the concept of investment incentives, but had sought to limit them to one or two years.
The legislation would also establish tax incentives to promote rebuilding in Lower Manhattan and reinstate a series of tax deductions and credits that expired recently. 
The unemployment benefit extension would cost $8.5 billion this year, while the business tax cuts would amount to $43 billion this year. 
The House voted soon after Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee in the most explicit terms he has used to date that the recession has given way to a rebound.
Alluding to several reports in recent days and weeks that industrial activity is rebounding, job losses are moderating, consumer spending remains strong and business efficiency remains remarkably healthy, Mr. Greenspan said the "evidence increasingly suggests that an economic expansion is already well under way."
Where last week he described the economy as "close to a turning point," Mr. Greenspan said today that the economy was "moving through a turning point." For the first time, he cited "encouraging signs in recent days that underlying trends in final demand are strengthening," economic jargon meaning that the economy is beginning to fire on all cylinders.
He repeated his statement of last week that the recovery is likely to be somewhat muted. But his statements suggested to economists and investors that the central bank could begin raising interest rates sooner than he had implied last week. The Fed cut rates 11 times last year as the economy decelerated sharply, bringing its benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans among banks to 1.75 percent, its lowest level in four decades.
In the futures markets, where investors gamble on future interest rate moves, they bet today that the Fed is now more likely than not to begin raising rates at its meeting in May and is all but certain to be raising rates by June. Last week the markets were assuming that there was little chance of a rate increase before summer and some chance of no move before fall.
Washington is just beginning to grapple with the implications of the recovery. A strong rebound could help restore some of the projected budget surplus, which withered away last year because of the recession and the increased spending as a result of the terrorist attacks as well as the $1.35 trillion 10-year tax cut Mr. Bush pushed through Congress.
A rebound could also allow Mr. Bush and Republicans on Capitol Hill to argue that last year's tax cut helped to speed the recovery, which has gathered more momentum than most economists had expected even a few weeks ago.
House Republicans said today that a brightening economic and fiscal picture could help them make the case for further tax cuts this year, including making permanent some provisions of last year's 10-year tax cut, especially the repeal of the federal estate tax.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: FEDERAL AID; 
Bush Offers Details Of Aid to New York Topping $20 Billion

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 7 

 BODY:
President Bush summoned top New York officials to the White House this afternoon and declared that he was moving to fulfill his promise to give the city at least $20 billion to help rebuild from the attack on the World Trade Center.
 The president's decision, which seeks to provide $1.5 billion on top of his original $20 billion pledge, seemed intended to quell the suspicions that New York Democrats had been expressing about the Bush administration's commitment to helping the city rebuild. 
 The president's plan did contain one detail that gave pause to some New York Democrats. It counted $5 billion in business tax credits for Lower Manhattan -- legislation passed in the House just today -- against the $21.5 billion aid package announced today. 
But these Democrats said that they were willing to live with it, if grudgingly, in the interest of finally resolving their differences with the White House. 
The plan includes $2.7 billion in disaster relief for cleanup at the site paid through the Federal Emergency Management Agency; $1.8 billion to rebuild the subway and PATH lines that were destroyed in Lower Manhattan; $750 million to reconstruct Con Edison and Verizon facilities, a cost that was going to be passed on to customers; and $167 million to repair roads, like the West Side Highway.
These pieces of the package require approval by Congress, where lawmakers in both parties have been uneasy about increased spending when the nation is at war and the economy has weakened. And one element, the bailout for utilities, requires changing the rules for how emergency aid can be used.
Mr. Bush made his announcement at a Rose Garden ceremony, with dozens of prominent New York officials at his side, including Gov. George E. Pataki, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and the state's two senators, Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
"This is the right thing to do," the president said. "It's the absolute right position for our government to take. It is essential that New York City come back and come back strong for the good of the entire nation."
The gathering stood in stark contrast to the past few months, during which New York lawmakers had stepped up criticism of the White House, questioning whether the president would live up to the commitment he made to them in the Roosevelt Room just days after the Sept. 11 attacks.
In January, Mr. Bush sought to ease those concerns, making a trip to New York City and reaffirming his pledge to provide the money to the city. But many Democrats remained doubtful even after that, saying that Mr. Bush had set no timetable for delivering the money -- and noting that the budget request he had presented to Congress days earlier sought no money for the recovery effort in New York.
Today, New York lawmakers, Democrats and Republicans alike, went out of their way to praise Mr. Bush in an afternoon White House ceremony that was attended by nearly all the 31 members of the state's Congressional delegation.
Mr. Pataki, who has been criticized by his Democratic rivals in this election year for not bringing home more of the aid, offered some of the most flattering words. "The people of New York know you as a man of your word," he said. "The people of America know you as a man of your word. And when you said that we would get $20 billion within those first hours after Sept. 11th, we knew that a commitment you make is a commitment you keep."
But the bitterness engendered by the battle of the past few months was barely below the surface. Even as he praised the president, Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of Manhattan, took a jab at the White House budget director, Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., who had to apologize for threatening last month to count billions of dollars in compensation to victims' families as part of the $20 billion and who also had accused New York lawmakers of engaging in "a money-grubbing game."
Mr. Rangel thanked the president "for making it easier" for New York lawmakers "not have to worry about the Office of Management and Budget." His comment elicited laughter, even as Mr. Daniels, who was standing in the colonnade outside the Oval Office, looked on uncomfortably.
To date, the White House and Congress have set aside about $11 billion in emergency aid for New York. The deal outlined today would provide an additional $5.5 billion in direct federal money, along with the $5 billion in tax credits and other incentives to keep businesses from leaving downtown Manhattan.
The Republican-controlled House passed the tax credit program, known as Liberty Zone, today as part of a larger economic stimulus plan for the nation. That plan includes 13 additional weeks of unemployment benefits for people who lost jobs in New York and elsewhere as a result of the attacks.
Today, Senator Tom Daschle, a Democrat from South Dakota who is the majority leader, described himself as pleased and encouraged by the House's action, and he scheduled a vote on the measure for Friday morning at 9:30.
The $5 billion Liberty Zone program was by far the most controversial part of the deal outlined today. Some Democrats privately complained that it was being counted as part of the $20 billion in recovery aid the president promised. They said it was reminiscent of a proposal that Mr. Daniels made in January to count $5 billion in federal benefits for families of victims of the attack against the $20 billion Mr. Bush promised. That proposal drew sharp criticism, and Mr. Daniels immediately withdrew it.
One Congressional Democrat from New York put it this way: "The event looked like a Bush re-election campaign commercial. Democrats were reading off White House talking points and singing his praises. But one question remains in the rush to claim victory: Did New York City get all its money or didn't it?"
Part of the disagreement stems from the fact that no one ever laid out specifically how the president's $20 billion commitment would be paid. The supporters of the tax credit program said that it was as crucial in helping rebuild New York as direct federal aid is.
New York's two Democratic senators, Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton, described themselves as satisfied with the president's proposal, indicating that the fight with the White House was over -- for now, anyway.
"This is a package that is generous for New York," said Mr. Schumer, who helped negotiate the package with the White House. "It doesn't cut corners. It doesn't give us everything we want. But it goes a long way."
Mrs. Clinton also said that New York's chances of getting additional disaster aid from Congress had gotten better. "Our prospects have improved exponentially because the administration has given its stamp of approval," she said.
Representative Thomas M. Reynolds, an upstate New York Republican who is very close to the House's conservative leaders, agreed. "I think it has good momentum as it goes to Congress," said Mr. Reynolds, who has sided with the president and Republican leaders in Congress during the fight for New York aid. "I think it's going to go fine."
In an interview this afternoon, Mr. Daniels, the White House budget director, said the administration would ask Congress for more money for New York in the next two weeks. He also said the deal announced today came together during negotiations with Mr. Pataki, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Bloomberg, who provided the administration with a list of the city's priorities.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Shares Dip Evenas Signs Indicate Economic Recovery

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street played it safe yesterday, pausing for mild profit taking even as more evidence of a recovering economy flowed in.
 Analysts said investors, while increasingly optimistic that a turnaround was beginning, were not convinced that the market's latest rally, which included a string of triple-digit gains in the Dow Jones industrials, would last. Wall Street was also concerned that a positive assessment of the economy by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, might signal higher interest rates. 
 The Dow closed down 48.92 points, or 0.5 percent, at 10,525.37, losing some ground from a 140-point gain Wednesday. 
Broader stock indicators also dropped. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 5.23 points, or 0.5 percent, to 1,157.54. The Nasdaq composite index finished down 8.77 points, also 0.5 percent, at 1,881.63.
"We're seeing some selling, but by and large this is just profit taking," said Richard A. Dickson, technical analyst at Hilliard Lyons.
After an early uptick, blue chips turned lower as investors collected gains from the sizable advances that had pushed the Dow to its highest level since mid-July.
Financial and manufacturing stocks, which had enjoyed some of the biggest gains in recent sessions, struggled. American Express fell 41 cents, to $39.51, while Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing lost 44 cents, to $121.13.
Conseco tumbled 16 cents, to $3.59, after Merrill Lynch cut its rating a day after Conseco's financial officer stepped down and Moody's Investors Service questioned whether Conseco could generate enough cash to pay its debt.
Boeing slid $1.38, to $48.48, after South African Airways decided to purchase 41 aircraft from Airbus.
But several retailers were higher, lifted by better-than-expected February sales. J. C. Penney advanced $2.08, to $21.27.
Technology stocks were also mixed. Gateway rose 33 cents, to $5.63, while Dell dropped 35 cents, to $27.59.
Intel rose 2 cents, to $32.98, ahead of a midquarter update expected late in the day. After the market closed, Intel tightened the range of its first-quarter sales forecast to $6.6 billion to $6.9 billion, still in line with most analysts' estimates. The company said demand for PC processors remained stable but the communications chip business was weak. The stock fell 11 cents, to $32.87, in after-hours trading.
Wall Street was both encouraged and unnerved by Mr. Greenspan's testimony before the Senate that a recovery was "already well under way" -- his most upbeat comments about the economy in a year.
Although investors want to hear that conditions are improving, they do not like the prospect of higher interest rates; the Fed lowered rates 11 times in 2001 to stimulate growth, and there is concern the central bank might view a healthy economy as reason to start raising them again.
Investors had little reaction to a Labor Department report showing new unemployment claims fell last week, continuing a steady decline.
Advancing and declining issues traded nearly evenly on the New York Stock Exchange. Consolidated volume came to 1.87 billion shares, compared with 1.89 billion Wednesday. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall (By Bloomberg News)
The most active 10-year Treasury note tumbled yesterday, driving yields to an eight-month high, after positive comments from the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, lifted expectations that the Fed would raise interest rates by midyear.
The benchmark note declined for a sixth day, its longest losing streak since October 2000. It fell 1 11/32, to a price of 97 10/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 5.23 percent from 5.05 percent. The 30-year bond also dropped sharply, falling 1 19/32, to a price of 96. Its yield rose to 5.66 percent from 5.54 percent.

HEADLINE: Tariffs May Temper a Glut of Steel 

BYLINE:  By Mickey Kantor; Mickey Kantor served as secretary of commerce and United States trade representative during the Clinton administration.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
In the world of trade policy, no good deed goes unpunished. The Bush administration made the right call in imposing tariffs of up to 30 percent on selected steel imports from major exporting countries. The expression of support from industry, labor and Congress has been exceeded in volume by the howls of protest from our trading partners. Even so, this action was necessary for reasons beyond the immediate plight of the American steel industry.
 President Bush's action falls within the World Trade Organization agreement that lets nations take temporary measures to keep their domestic industries competitive. There is serious overcapacity in the steel industry worldwide. Negotiations about reducing production, conducted in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and elsewhere, have not alleviated the current glut of steel. Thirty-one American steel companies have gone bankrupt since 1997, and the steel industry in many nations is in jeopardy. As controversial as the tariff decision is, it is an effective way to jump-start serious talks and can pave the way for a major consolidation of the industry worldwide. 
 The most important reason for the administration's action has to do with our leadership in trade. To move forward on a trade agenda that can open new markets and address trade distortions, any administration must have credibility with Congress and the American people. Not acting in the face of an obvious deterioration of the American steel industry would create the perception that we are unwilling to enforce our trade laws. We need to stand up for legitimate interests. Failure to act would also be unhelpful to the prospects of trade promotion authority now pending in the Senate (a measure that must contain enhanced authority to help workers and communities displaced by trade pacts). 
The European Union complained formally to the W.T.O. about the tariffs yesterday, and countries in other regions may do the same, alleging violations of our trade obligations. The case for our action is supportable, and it is not certain that any challenge will prevail. The need to enforce our trade laws and to address acute problems in this industry is more important than a protracted dispute at the W.T.O.
In fact, the imposition of the tariffs could well lead to new and productive discussions between European and American negotiators on other trade problems as well. In the past, invoking our trade laws has induced our trading partners to come to the table to resolve difficult disputes. In 1993, the Clinton administration imposed trade sanctions on the European Union for discriminating against American-made steam generators and heavy electrical equipment. Soon afterward, the United States and the Europeans entered into a two-part agreement to end the discrimination and to jump-start the Uruguay round of trade talks by reducing tariffs in major manufacturing industries to zero.
Currently, the United States and the European Union are fighting over the tax benefits given to American companies for their foreign sales and over the size of the penalty to be imposed on the United States for granting them. Other trade disputes involve the illegal moratorium the Europeans have imposed on the import of products made from genetically modified plants, questions of privacy in commercial transactions, and the importation of beef produced with hormones. It is in everyone's interest that these issues be resolved fairly.
If the steel tariffs bring serious negotiations on all these matters, the winners will be all those who would be helped by open markets and expanded world economic activity, and that includes our European friends. Long after the inflated anti-tariff rhetoric has faded, the benefit of enforcing our trade laws will become clear.

HEADLINE: What a Difference a Week Makes 

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
In just over a week, in Alan Greenspan's view, the economic recovery has gone from a maybe to a certainty. "Recent evidence increasingly suggests that an economic expansion is already well under way," Mr. Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee yesterday. On Feb. 27, he had been only guardedly optimistic in his testimony, saying that he expected the economy would soon emerge from the downturn that began last year.
 The newly upbeat talk from Mr. Greenspan took stock and bond traders by surprise. These market participants, who had believed that a weak economy would keep interest rates low well into 2002, must now reckon with the possibility that rates may rise before the middle of the year. 
 As a result, stocks and bonds fell yesterday.
"Mr. Greenspan's message was that a tightening in monetary policy will happen sooner," said Bill Quan, director of research at Mizuho Securities USA. "On Feb. 27, he implied that the economic recovery would be gradual and aggressive tightening would not be needed. Now he feels the economic recovery is well under way so market participants feel that tightenings would be pushed forward."
Many bond traders quickly shifted to the view that a one-quarter-point increase in the Fed's target for the federal funds rate, which is how much banks charge each other for overnight loans, could come as early as May but no later than June. 
Some traders wondered what had made Mr. Greenspan change his tune from the possibility that growth would soon return to the United States economy to the certainty that it already had. 
To be sure, there has been some evidence that manufacturing activity has risen recently. State unemployment figures, one of the 10 leading economic indicators, have also declined for four consecutive months.
Retail sales have shined recently, but this is not exactly news, since the consumer has remained remarkably willing to spend even during the economic decline.
Moody's reported that only 28 retailers reported declines in sales at stores open at least a year in February, down from a monthly average of 42 in the fourth quarter of 2001. 
Forty-two retailers reported an increase in sales at those stores last month, topping the monthly average of 39 at the end of last year.
While all these signs point to better times, many traders said that they were not enough to produce the shift in thinking that Mr. Greenspan's testimony indicated. Instead, they speculated that the Fed chairman's optimism was based on figures not yet available to the public: the February employment report that is due out at 8:30 a.m. today. 
"He wouldn't have voiced so much confidence if he didn't have some strong sense that the employment report would be in keeping with an improved tone of economic activity," said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Investors Service. "You get the feeling from Mr. Greenspan's more upbeat assessment of the economy that we will see the first increase in nonfarm payrolls in February in six months." 
A close parsing of Mr. Greenspan's words shows a slight but nonetheless significant change in his discussion of the labor market, said Jan Hatzius, senior economist at Goldman Sachs. Last week, Mr. Greenspan said performance of the labor market "is" expected to lag. This week, he said this performance "was" expected to lag. "In discussing the labor market's deterioration, he presented the view that he was talking in the past tense," Mr. Hatzius said.
Mr. Greenspan did temper his newfound enthusiasm with the view that the economic growth that is now in evidence will probably be subdued. 
In stating that the recovery had begun, he added this qualifier: "an array of influences unique to this business cycle seems likely to moderate its speed." If growth is only moderate, interest rate increases may not come as quickly as bond traders fear.
Indeed, Mr. Hatzius says he expects the Fed to keep interest rates low throughout 2002, as it did during the last recession of the early 1990's.
"Then they took a really long time to reverse their very low short-term interest rates," Mr. Hatzius said. "They were still easing in 1992 as we came out of recession, and didn't make the first tightening move until February 1994. Friendly monetary policy is going to be a positive going forward."

HEADLINE: Company Payrolls Show Rise For First Time in Nine Months 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Companies added workers to their payrolls in February for the first time in nine months, the government said yesterday, the strongest evidence yet that the economy is emerging from the recession.
 With consumer spending continuing to increase and service companies hiring workers, the economy created 66,000 jobs last month, and the unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent, from 5.6 percent in January, according to the Labor Department's seasonally adjusted numbers. 
 "The period of big job losses is behind us," said Richard D. Rippe, the chief economist at Prudential Securities. "Employment is stabilizing, but it will be sluggish for a while." 
Airlines added employees in February for the first time since May, and hospitals and medical offices continued to show strong growth. Temporary-help agencies, often a leading indicator of the economy's health, ended a 16-month streak of cutting employment. While manufacturing, the sector hardest hit by the downturn, continued to pare jobs, the loss was the smallest since late 2000.
The Labor Department released its report one day after Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, told a Senate committee that a recovery had begun, and analysts greeted yesterday's news as a confirmation. Stocks rose, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing at 10,572.49, up 47.12 points, and bonds fell, with investors betting that the Fed will raise its benchmark interest rate before the summer to ward off inflation. Many economists, however, expect the Fed to wait longer.
Although the data suggested that the labor market could be at a turning point, Labor Department officials cautioned that the report might have exaggerated the economy's strength. The weather was unseasonably warm last month, and construction employment surged as builders accelerated their schedules. 
In addition, retailers added fewer workers during the holidays, causing an abnormally low number of layoffs early this year. As a result, the statistical adjustments the government uses to smooth seasonal job swings made the economy look worse than it was late last year and better than it has been this year. 
Most economists expect the recovery to be moderate, largely because the recession has been mild and consumer spending has remained strong, leaving little room for spending to accelerate. With companies continuing to use technology to improve efficiency, executives will be able to bolster output without hiring many workers.
Without strong job growth, the unemployment rate will probably rise to about 6 percent this year, forecasters say. Most recessions since World War II have pushed the rate to a much higher level. 
In the weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks, companies cut jobs at the fastest pace since 1980, when President Jimmy Carter asked people to stop using credit cards in an effort to restrain inflation.
In the last three months of 2001, the economy lost more than 900,000 jobs. Until February, the most recent increase had come in July, when companies reduced their payrolls but government agencies made up for the loss. 
Since July, payrolls had consistently become smaller, even in months that the unemployment rate fell because fewer people were looking for work. Only people out of work and actively seeking jobs are considered unemployed by the government. 
But the labor market clearly improved last month. Service industries, which employ four of every five Americans, added 97,000 jobs, the largest rise since August. Health care companies increased employment by 34,000 jobs; temporary-help agencies by 14,000; and airlines and real estate companies by 5,000 each.
"It fits the classic pattern of an economy that is starting to gather momentum," said Richard Berner, the chief domestic economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. As demand rises, Mr. Berner said, service companies add workers quickly, while manufacturers wait until they have liquidated their inventories and the recovery seems solid.
In February, manufacturers cut 50,000 more jobs, reducing their payrolls by 1.7 million jobs, or about 9 percent, since the summer of 2000. Some jobs have moved overseas to countries with lower wages. Others have disappeared as companies, especially technology manufacturers, have realized that their earlier growth projections were too rosy.
As the labor market has weakened, wage growth has slowed, but only slightly. Over the last year, the average weekly earnings of workers paid by the hour has increased 3.1 percent, to almost $499. Combined with low inflation, the raises have given workers more purchasing power even as the economy fell into recession. 
The average length of unemployment continued to rise last month, to 15 weeks, from 12.8 weeks a year earlier. Since Sept. 11, almost 1.5 million workers have exhausted their jobless benefits, which typically last for 26 weeks. 
The Senate voted 85 to 9 yesterday to extend unemployment benefits by 13 weeks for many people; the House passed a similar measure on Thursday. President Bush is expected to sign the bill.
Even if the recession has ended, as Mr. Greenspan suggested, unemployment could rise for months if job growth fails to match normal growth in the labor market. The previous recession ended in March 1991, according to an academic committee that tracks business cycles, but joblessness increased through the summer of 1992.
Unemployment reached a 30-year low of 3.9 percent in late 2000 and gradually rose to 5.8 percent in December 2001. 
The large growth in retail employment offered the biggest reason for skepticism in yesterday's report, economists said. Using historical hiring patterns to seasonally adjust the numbers, the Labor Department said retail stores added 58,000 jobs last month. If the government had used an alternate method, and based its adjustments on recent statistics, the increase would have been 14,000 jobs, erasing most of last month's overall gain, said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
That suggests the recession may have ended but its effect could linger. "It would be premature to say that there is going to be heavy net hiring soon," said Edward F. McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs.

HEADLINE: CUNY and Its Staff Members Agree on New Labor Contract 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
The City University of New York reached a tentative labor contract yesterday with its faculty and staff union, the Professional Staff Congress, in an agreement that both sides said would help CUNY regain its stature.
 The two groups announced that the settlement would provide a 9 percent increase over 27 months in the total economic package for the 17,200 professors, instructors, adjuncts and others covered by the contract, which will run through Oct. 31, 2002. 
 Although CUNY is not a city agency -- the state pays a far larger share of its operating budget -- the increase parallels that won by District Council 37 and some of the other municipal unions in the municipal bargaining agreements concluded over the last year. 
The agreement is subject to approval by both CUNY's trustees and the union membership. The union has been without a contract since July 31, 2000.
Although both sides declined to provide further details until the contract has received preliminary approval and the city and state have made final cost calculations, they applauded the settlement.
"There are great things here, for our members, our students and the university itself," said Barbara Bowen, the union's president. "Not only were we able to secure significant salary increases, but we also addressed historic inequities in salaries and made structural changes that will strengthen the university."
Matthew Goldstein, CUNY's chancellor, called it a "landmark agreement."
The agreement covers 5,500 full-time faculty members, 7,000 part-time, and 4,700 nonteaching staff members. 
The announcement said that the settlement included "across-the-board salary increases for all job titles, advances in professionalism and pay for part-time faculty, other enhancements of terms and conditions of employment, and opportunities for research and professional development for faculty and staff." 
Dr. Bowen, an English professor at Queens College and a former union organizer, made the contract a central plank in her platform when she and others known as the New Caucus won control of the faculty and staff union in April 2000. At the time, she said that the major challenge was to rebuild CUNY and stop the replacement of full-time professionals with adjuncts.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE FAMILIES; 
A Town's Public Memory, Its Residents' Private Grief

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: MIDDLETOWN, N.J., March 8 

 BODY:
A middle-aged widow rarely gets out of bed when the sun is up. Another staves off the pain with mounds of paperwork and nonstop errands. One young mother, inconsolable and financially overwhelmed, has scared friends with dark suggestions that she and her children might join her husband in heaven. For a mother coping with a lost son, spirituality has become a comfort and a crusade.
 Weather-beaten American flags still fly from every other minivan antenna, and the signs along Route 35 still proclaim "God Bless Middletown," but for most residents of this comfortable, self-concerned suburb, life has regained its former hectic rhythms, marked by early morning commutes, early evening intramural sports and monthly mortgage payments. 
 But six months after the destruction of the World Trade Center, there is little normalcy for the 34 households here that lost a family member. If anything, the surviving family members say, the daily struggles with sadness and anger have become more debilitating. The shock and numbness, the whirl of condolence visits and the bewildering distractions of Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year have given way to unrelieved bleakness. 
"As stupid as it sounds, the first two months, you still have hope he's going to come home," said Isabel Nimbley, a mother of five who lost her husband, Paul. "Now it's sinking in that he's gone, and it just keeps getting worse and worse." 
Not that Middletown has turned away from the suffering. A zealous group of volunteers is still delivering cash, whimsical care packages and free vacations to the families; local schoolchildren are ready to shovel driveways should a late winter snowstorm arrive. Down at the municipal center, officials are preparing to honor the victims with a graceful memorial behind the train station. At the ShopRite and during basketball games at Middletown South High School, people still shake their heads when referring to Middletown's sad ranking as the community outside New York City with the highest death toll. It is just that the communal agony has been eclipsed by the private realities of work and family.
"The good will is still there, but a lot of people who weren't directly affected have begun to move on," said Detective Sgt. Joseph Capriotti of the Middletown Police Department. 
That good will, so pervasive in the first few months, has been partly drained by other events, including a teachers strike in December that led to the jailing of 225 strikers. The bitterness has yet to fade, and as many as 100 teachers have already told the union that they plan to leave the district at the end of the school year. "The teachers are feeling dejected and unappreciated and the parents are mad that they went on strike and went to jail," said Joy Rothman, president of the Middletown Township Education Foundation, which raises money for the schools. "The morale is horrible." 
Still more storm clouds are gathering over another matter: a proposed $150 million shopping center that would consume one of the last patches of open space in this monument to freewheeling sprawl. Contention over the project, dormant since Sept. 11, will heat up later this month when the town holds a hearing on the project. Already, lawn signs proclaiming a homeowner's position on the so-called Town Center have begun to compete for attention with the ubiquitous American flags. 
These days there are other kinds of lawn signs, the ones that indicate a home is on the market and a family is on the move. Seldom seen in the boom years, the for-sale signs offer growing evidence that the layoffs on Wall Street and the downsizing at nearby Lucent and AT&T are beginning to hit this township of 66,000. For Middletown households, many of them dual-income and living slightly beyond their means, they are another discomforting reminder of how precarious a life with in-ground pool, media room and two S.U.V.'s can be.
Still, the spreading economic worries and public tussles over schools and development are largely irrelevant to Kristen Breitweiser, who spends her days focused on protecting the innocence and happiness of her daughter, and prodding officials to make sure that government compensation packages are fair. So far, Caroline, who turns 3 later this month, is blissfully uncomprehending of what happened to her father, Ronald, on that morning six months ago.
"I want her to smile and giggle forever and ever," Ms. Breitweiser said, pushing Caroline on a backyard swing. "No child should ever have to know that all they have of their father is his left arm." 
Feisty and philosophical, Ms. Breitweiser, 31, has run on a potent mix of grief and fury since the death of her husband, who worked at Fiduciary Trust. Neither the passage of time nor the books on grieving have been much of a salve. "I'm just trying to get through each day, trying to reinvent myself," she said on a bright, bitterly cold day, chasing Caroline through a nature preserve that adjoins her property. "I don't want to be known as the 9/11 widow. I don't want people to look at me and feel sad. I don't want them to look at Caroline and say, 'Poor little girl.' "
Ms. Breitweiser said she had contemplated moving away from Middletown, both to find anonymity and, perhaps, to shed some of the memories that permeate the bright, modern home she and her husband shared. His photographs are everywhere, as are some of the sunny Post-it notes he scribbled out the morning he died. "Sometimes I find them reassuring," she said. "Other days they're just a slap in the face, reminders of what was, and what will never be. Still, I can't take them down."
Fortified with an inner strength, Ms. Breitweiser is luckier than many. One Middletown widow, who asked that her name not be used, has been crippled by depression. "If I had young children, I'd be more motivated to get better," she said. "But all I want to do is sleep and sleep and sleep." Another woman who does have children, both of them toddlers, has rarely been left alone since she confided to a friend last month a desire to "meet her husband in heaven," with her children. 
Detective Capriotti, 45, who is Middletown's unofficial liaison to the families, said he had noticed a second wave of bereavement prompted by a recent spate of victim identifications. "They were beginning to cope with it and then they get the knock on their door," he said. "It's almost like they're dying twice." Detective Capriotti is often the one knocking, accompanied by a nun or priest. He has delivered such news to about half the families.
Elaine Chevalier is luckier than most. Rescue workers discovered the body of her son, Swede, 26, less than a week after the towers fell. She and her husband, Vernon, have created several home shrines to their son: the one in the foyer is anchored by his favorite Warren Buffett book, a rawhide bone that belonged to his dog, and an old hockey jersey. The one in the kitchen features a few framed photographs and candles. Photo montages in the dining room and library show Swede as a fraternity brother at Cornell or as a towheaded child with an impish grin. "I don't want anyone to forget him," Mrs. Chevalier said. 
Swede Chevalier's youngest sister, Brittany, 15, has been channeling her grief into Teens for Teens, a local bereavement group, which meets for rap sessions, ski trips and outings to the mall. Her mother, too, has started a support group, underpinned by her Roman Catholic faith. "Before 9/11, I was a woman of the world, a businesswoman," she said. "Life is different, now that I've stepped into a spiritual plane." 
Almost catatonic those first wrenching weeks, Mrs. Chevalier said she began to recover her footing after a series of comforting dreams that featured her son and Christian saints. "Maybe people will think I'm wacky, but I get signs all the time that he's here with me," she said. "When I came to that realization, it was easier."
Tina Grazioso's mantelpiece shrine has just a few pictures of her husband, John, and a wooden urn of ground zero ashes, one of those distributed by New York City. Her husband's body was never found; that of his brother Timothy has been recovered. Both men worked at Cantor Fitzgerald. Like the other Middletown widows, Ms. Grazioso said the pain had intensified in recent months, although she is thankful for the distractions provided by three children, the youngest of whom is 15 months old.
"There are times when you're in the car by yourself when it really hits you," she said, turning away from the girls as tears welled up. "You shed some tears, and then you keep going." 
She tries to stay upbeat, especially for Kathryn, 7, and Kristen, 5, who are struggling to understand why their father never came home from work. During the day, busy with school and play, they seem fine. But at bedtime, after Ms. Grazioso reads them stories and sings "Amazing Grace," the questions pour out: Were the bad guys smiling when they crashed the plane into the buildings? they ask. If Mommy dies while shopping at Target, how will we get home?
"It's horrible that a 5-year-old has to think about things like that," Ms. Grazioso, 35, said. 
As she spoke, Kristen ran upstairs to fetch a CD she wanted to play for a visitor. It was the dance song "Please Don't Go," with those three words forming the chorus, a beseeching refrain that repeated again and again. "We should have played this for Daddy before he went to work," she explained. Just then the phone rang and Kristen eagerly ran to answer it. It was a telemarketer asking to speak to her father. "Daddy died in the World Trade Center," she said without emotion. The caller abruptly hung up.
During the first few months after Mr. Grazioso vanished, his youngest child, Michael, would merrily grab at photographs of his father and screech "Da-da." In some small way, it brought Ms. Grazioso comfort. But in recent weeks, as his garbled vocabulary grew, that word inexplicably stopped coming.
Hoping to disprove the point, Ms. Grazioso held up a photograph of her husband, a golden wire attached to the frame forming a halo over his head, and asked Michael who it was. He smiled but promptly lost interest. "It kind of hurts," she said. Then, pulling Michael close to her, she said, "The next haircut, we're going to get one so you look like Da-da. O.K.?"

HEADLINE: Schering-Plough to Offer Nonprescription Claritin 

BYLINE:  By MILT FREUDENHEIM 

 BODY:
With low-priced competition looming for Claritin, the heavily advertised allergy drug, the Schering-Plough Corporation said yesterday that it would offer a nonprescription version later this year. Analysts predicted a drugstore free-for-all that could drive down prices for consumers and severely erode Schering-Plough's profits in 2003.
 Claritin, which had sales of $2.7 billion last year, is expected to lose its main patent protection in December. It would then compete with copycat products promoted by marketing juggernauts like Johnson & Johnson and American Home Products, as well as store brands. 
 Shares of Schering-Plough fell $1.96 yesterday, to $34.
Health plan officials said that members typically pay $10 to $25 toward the price of a bottle of Claritin tablets. The nonprescription versions are expected to cost less. Without insurance, Claritin costs at least $70 for a 30-day supply.
Health insurance policies rarely, if ever, pay for nonprescription drugs. Consumers pay the entire cost. So insurers and their customers -- employers -- will be the big winners, saving the costs of both the drug and visits to doctors by allergy patients seeking prescriptions.
Spokesmen for the McNeill Consumer and Specialty Pharmaceuticals unit of Johnson & Johnson and the Whitehall-Robins unit of American Home Products said yesterday that they planned to produce versions of loratadine, the generic name of Claritin, after the patent expires.
McNeill, which makes Tylenol, and Whitehall-Robins, which makes Advil, have switched these and many other strong-selling prescription drugs to over-the-counter versions.
"We don't think we can be outgunned" in the Claritin wars, said Robert Essner, the president and chief executive of American Home Products. He said Whitehall-Robins could quickly market an over-the-counter version if the Claritin patent expires in December.
Schering-Plough has sued to block Claritin knockoffs by the two companies, accusing them of patent infringement. Schering-Plough said in a statement yesterday that it had patents on various types of prescription Claritin that extend through 2012.
A spokeswoman for the Food and Drug Administration said there was no guarantee of exclusivity when drugs that have lost their patent protection become available without a prescription.
Schering-Plough has already begun a high-profile advertising drive for an alternative allergy drug, Clarinex. Most analysts say Clarinex has shown little evidence of improving on Claritin in medical terms.
Managed-care executives said nonprescription Claritin would affect the entire $5 billion market for nonsedating allergy drugs that Claritin created. These drugs include Zyrtec, made by Pfizer, and Allegra, made by Aventis. 
Claritin and Zyrtec were among the five most heavily advertised drugs in the first half of last year, according to the latest report on consumer drug advertising by IMS Health, a drug research firm. Allegra was the sixth highest. Total spending for the three was $162 million for the six months ended June 30. IMS said consumer advertising for Clarinex had not been tabulated yet.
Health insurance plans hope to shift consumers to the nonprescription versions as soon as they appear. Dr. Robert Seidman, the chief pharmaceutical officer of Wellpoint Health Networks, said it would discourage use of all three prescription products by requiring "prior authorization" or the highest level of payment by health plan members.
Wellpoint originated the call for nonprescription status for the drugs. It won an endorsement last year from an F.D.A. advisory committee, which declared the allergy drugs safe for sale without a prescription.
The Wellpoint campaign was "a landmark" attack on the drug makers' strategy of stoking consumer demand for products and swamping efforts by managed health care plans to hold down costs, said Stephen W. Schondelmeyer, a pharmaceuticals economist at the University of Minnesota. 
Neil B. Sweig, a drug securities analyst with Fulcrum Global Partners, a broker for institutional investors, said Claritin generated 27.7 percent of Schering-Plough's sales last year. He said Allegra was an important product for Aventis, but Zyrtec was relatively small for Pfizer.
Schering-Plough, which is based in Kenilworth, N.J., has reported strong introductory sales for Clarinex, starting in January. But Mr. Sweig noted that the company provided coupons for heavy discounts on the new product.
It was not clear whether companies that make low-priced generic versions of drugs that have lost their patents would be able to compete with nonprescription versions of Claritin. "The price is likely to drop to 10 or 15 percent of what it was," said Dr. Alan Sokolow, chief medical officer of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield in New York. "That takes a lot of the incentive out of making a generic."
One earlier example was ibuprofen, which was switched to nonprescription Advil and Motrin. A prescription version is still available, but the price is very low.
Some nonprescription switches do receive exclusivity rights. Procter & Gamble and AstroZeneca are partners in developing an over-the-counter version of Prilosec, a strong-selling heartburn treatment that will lose its patent protection later this year.
A spokesman for Procter & Gamble said the partners expected to have exclusive rights for three years.

HEADLINE: Needed to Cover Arizona District: A Jet 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY 

DATELINE: WINSLOW, Ariz., March 6 

 BODY:
Anyone who wants to run for the House of Representatives in Arizona's First Congressional District will need more than money. A dependable car would be a major asset. So would spare tires.
 As the largest of 12 new districts in the country that grew out of the 2000 census, the First covers nearly 60,000 square miles, more than half the state, and takes in the densely populated areas outside Phoenix and Tucson and unpopulated areas that are bigger than Rhode Island. 
 Despite its size, or perhaps because of it, an unusually large number of candidates -- eight Democrats and six Republicans -- have emerged to compete for the district's seat in the September primaries. The general election is expected to be wide open. 
Both parties have made the Arizona First a priority because of the chance to pick up a seat. In contrast to states where new districts were drawn by partisan legislatures, Arizona's new map was created by an independent redistricting commission, which favored neither Democrats nor Republicans.
"Its a new animal," Fred Solip, a professor of political science at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, said of the First, one of two new districts Arizona gained, for a total of eight. "It's also a huge animal that no one is quite sure what to make of."
Arizona's other new district, the Seventh, is in the southwest corner of the state around Yuma. 
One of the eight Democrats running in the First, Sam Martinez, called the district "humongous," adding, "I could put 40,000 miles on my car just by the primary." 
Standing on a corner in Winslow, a town struggling to become more than a line in an Eagles song, any candidate could understand why.
To the north are the Grand Canyon and small towns that rely almost solely on tourism and other services. 
To the east are growing towns like Snowflake and Show Low but also the Navajo and Apache reservations, where poverty and unemployment remain stubbornly high. 
To the south are sprawling suburbs that flow out of Phoenix and Tucson, and beyond them, less affluent areas that depend on mining, ranching and farming.
To the west are pockets of well-to- do stability in Democratic towns like Flagstaff and Sedona and Republican towns like Prescott and Cottonwood.
Even with all that and a population that is 41 percent Hispanic American Indian, the state panel produced a highly competitive district. As drawn, its voters favored President Bill Clinton in 1996 and George W. Bush in 2000, even though registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by 150,000 to 110,000.
For now, six months from the primaries, candidates are still plotting campaign strategies and no real front-runners have emerged. The only candidate with any name recognition is Stephen G. Udall, the Apache County Attorney from St. John's and a Democrat whose family has been involved in state and national politics for three generations.
Befitting the characteristics of the district, the candidates have varied backgrounds. The Democrats include lawmakers, lawyers and business people. The Republicans are even more diverse and include a radio talk-show host and a rancher.
Gaining attention here will not be easy. Television commercials in the state's biggest markets, Phoenix and Tucson, would reach more voters outside the district than inside. Radio advertising, highway billboards and fliers are considered better investments although transportation costs should eat up the largest part of a campaign budget if opinions here in Winslow, a town of 9,520 people, are any indication. That's where the car comes in.
The biggest question for candidates to confront, people here say, is whether or not they can reconcile the various needs of all the people in this diverse district. "I want them to talk to people who care about what happens to us," said Janice Griffith, director of the Old Trails Museum and the incoming president of the Winslow Chamber of Commerce. Ms. Griffith said her greatest fear is that the needs of Winslow might be subsumed by larger demands elsewhere, like wrenching poverty on the reservations, inadequate roads in the growth areas or the need to balance environmental concerns with heavy industry. 
Ms. Griffith and others said they worry that the candidates will not bother to visit, instead concentrating on more populated areas, like Flagstaff, Prescott and the areas east of Phoenix and north of Tucson. That may be a legitimate concern.
One of the Democratic candidates, Fred Duval of Flagstaff, who worked in the Clinton White House as liaison to governors, predicted that candidates would either focus on specific areas where voting tendencies might favor them or they would try to meet as many voters as possible, crisscrossing the district by car.
Mr. Duval said he would take the former approach while Lewis Tenney, a Republican Navajo County supervisor from Heber, said he would to take to the road. 
"It's awfully difficult," Mr. Tenney said of his vow to cover the district. "From the southeast corner of the district to the northwest, it's a seven- or eight-hour drive, and you can't even spend all that time on a cellphone because of so many dead spots."

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Economic Stimulus Bill 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8 

 BODY:
The Senate gave final Congressional approval today to a package of tax cuts for business and extended benefits for unemployed workers, bringing to a close a partisan battle over how to help the economy.
 The vote was 85 to 9, with eight Democrats and a lone Republican, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, opposing the measure. 
 The bill now goes to President Bush, who will sign it during Saturday's radio address, the White House said.
The legislation is the main response by Congress to the recession, but it was held up for so long by differences between the Republican-controlled House and the Democrat-controlled Senate that the downturn appears to be over. Millions of workers, however, remain unemployed. 
Still, members of both parties said the legislation would help ensure a healthy recovery by encouraging businesses to invest more in new factories and equipment. They said it would also help the people who needed it most, workers who had exhausted their unemployment benefits but had not yet found another job.
The bill passed the House on Thursday, after Republican leaders and Mr. Bush capitulated on their demand that any economic recovery legislation include a broader package of tax cuts, including an acceleration of income tax rate reductions for middle- and upper-income workers. Early versions of the bill passed by the House last fall also would have repealed the corporate alternative minimum tax, a provision that would have given many companies big refunds.
The bill passed today also omitted a provision that had been championed by Democrats in months of debate over how to respond to the downturn. That provision was a $300 per person payment to low- and middle-income workers who did not receive a rebate under the tax cut Mr. Bush signed into law last year.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic majority leader, said, "We were able to do this today, in large measure, because House Republicans dropped their insistence that any aid for workers be coupled with massive tax breaks for wealthy individuals and wealthy corporations." 
The eight Democrats who voted against the bill were Robert C. Byrd and John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia; Thomas R. Carper of Delaware; Kent Conrad of North Dakota; Mark Dayton of Minnesota; Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut; Russell D. Feingold of Wisconsin; and Carl Levin of Michigan. 
Republicans said the bill was all right as far as it went. But they said it would be far less potent medicine for the economy than their original proposal and that it missed a chance to address other issues, like health insurance for the unemployed, where the gulf between the parties could not be bridged.
"There is good news in terms of extended unemployment benefits, bonus depreciation and other measures," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. "But there's bad news in terms of missed opportunities."
Administration officials portrayed the outcome in positive terms, playing down Mr. Bush's previous insistence that the legislation contain far more in tax cuts than the bill that passed today. 
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said in a statement that the legislation was "a great victory for American workers and their families" and that the business tax provisions would help "speed Americans back to work."
Under the business provisions, companies would be able to write off 30 percent more of their new capital investments for the next three years than under current law. For the next two years, they would also be able to apply losses to their previous five years of tax returns, up from two years under current law.
The business tax cuts would amount to about $43 billion this year.
The bill would also extend unemployment benefits in most states by 13 weeks beyond the current limit, which is 26 weeks in most states. It would also make it easier for some states to qualify for federal financing to extend benefits by a second 13 weeks.
The unemployment package would cost $8.5 billion this year.
The bill also includes tax incentives for rebuilding in Lower Manhattan, as well as a renewal of a series of tax credits and deductions that have expired but that have broad bipartisan support. Those provisions amount to a tax cut of about $1.2 billion this year.

HEADLINE: White House Memo; 
Bush Is Still Winning War There, But He Begins to Lose Battles Here

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8 

 BODY:
Ever since Sept. 11, President Bush has used his steady command of the war and his soaring approval ratings to his enormous political advantage. As one aide said not long ago, "With these kinds of approval ratings, why compromise?"
 But this week Mr. Bush has found himself compromising plenty. On a variety of policy and personnel issues he is even in the odd position of playing defense at home while continuing on the offense against Al Qaeda. 
 None of his troubles, by themselves, amount to major setbacks in Washington terms. After all, the evidence this week indicates that the economy is bouncing back faster and stronger than many expected -- easing the fears of White House political strategists that Mr. Bush might be doomed to repeat the bitter experience of his father. Also, with Democrats disorganized and American forces seeking out terrorists in Afghanistan and beyond, there is no question the president is the biggest power to be reckoned with, here and abroad.
But the combination of Mr. Bush's troubles in Congress and signs of eroding discipline within the administration suggests, as one White House official conceded recently, that "the post-attack glow is fading."
In fact, the list of recent annoyances, compromises and minor battles lost is a bit startling.
The economic stimulus package that Congress approved overwhelmingly this week is far closer to what Democrats proposed last year than to what Mr. Bush had in mind, though that did not stop Mr. Bush from enthusiastically embracing it. 
His announcement on Wednesday that he would impose tariffs of up to 30 percent on imported steel in an effort to save a long-declining industry was welcomed by the industry and workers fearful of layoffs. But it left the White House in the awkward position of explaining why Mr. Bush had turned on his free-trade principles and how much that reversal would cost Americans paying for cars, houses and washing machines. 
The problems hardly stopped there. Mr. Bush's effort to elevate Judge Charles W. Pickering to a federal appeals court is virtually certain to be rebuffed by Senate Democrats, and the White House has all but given up efforts to put together the 60 votes needed to break a threatened Senate filibuster on the president's proposal to drill for oil in the Alaska wildlife refuge. 
Mr. Bush's handpicked candidate for governor of California, the former Los Angeles mayor Richard J. Riordan, was trounced in the Republican primary, leaving White House officials grumbling that their man had run an incompetent campaign.
Also, for the first time in his presidency, Mr. Bush had to fire a political appointee for public disloyalty, showing the door to the head of the Army Corps of Engineers, Mike Parker, a popular former congressman, who had testified before Congress that the Bush budget proposal for the corps was at best unrealistic and at worst a cynical ploy to force Congress to take the blame for spending more. 
All this was happening as Mr. Bush was forced by the enormity of the violence breaking out in the Mideast to reverse himself there. He confronted Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel over his policy of shelling the Palestinians to the bargaining table and announced that he had changed his mind and would dispatch a special envoy to the region.
There is no evidence that any of this has diminished Mr. Bush's standing with the public. But there are indications that his successes in the war have not proven easily transferable to Congress or to foreign allies. Some say he should not be surprised.
"This often happens in times of war," said Allan J. Lichtman, a professor of history at American University and a student of the strains of presidential power. "It's not usually been a moment to advance your domestic agenda, no matter how tall you are standing in the war."
Mr. Lichtman contends that Mr. Bush's approval ratings may have been over-read in the White House. Even when Americans showed overwhelming support for the president and his leadership, he said, approval of specific policies ran a lot lower.
"They were looking at the moon reflecting the light of the sun," he said, "and didn't notice that the heat was missing."
Not surprisingly, White House officials interpret these same events in a very different way. Whatever compromises were made on the economic stimulus bill, said Dan Bartlett, Mr. Bush's communications director, "the bottom line is that this only passed through the president's insistence, and that's the only reason we finally have Congressional action on helping America's workers."
The Pickering nomination and the problems with Alaskan drilling, Mr. Bartlett added, show the dangers of a world in which "there's a new definition of a majority vote in the Senate." He referred to the 60-vote minimum to bring an issue to a vote, glossing over the fact that Republicans have used the filibuster themselves to thwart Democratic presidents. 
As for the reversal on the Middle East, the national security team says there was none, just an opportunity that Mr. Bush alertly leaped on, created by the revulsion over the escalation of violence and the hope created by Saudi Arabia's declaration that peace could lead to normalization of Israel's relations with its neighbors.
"This hasn't been a bad week," Mr. Bartlett insisted. "It's been a week of presidential leadership."
Whether it is leadership or Washington gamesmanship, there is little question that the White House is not quite as zipped up as it was only a few months ago.
In Mr. Bush's first year, it was rare that news of policy differences leaked out, at least until well after those differences were resolved. Certainly, documents stayed inside the White House. But now Mr. Bush's circle of appointees has spread far beyond the loyal corps that grew up in his governor's office, or in the heat of the presidential campaign. This means that there is a reasonable chance that differences of opinion will be made public, often to the distress of the president.
That was the case with Mr. Parker. A memorandum written by Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the president's budget director, to Andrew H. Card, the White House chief of staff; Mr. Card's deputy, Josh Bolten; and Karl Rove, the president's chief political adviser, made it clear that the White House viewed Mr. Parker's budget comments as disloyal. He was gone in hours.
When the steel decision was being debated, it was clear that many of Mr. Bush's advisers took radically different positions on what the president should do. But that time the White House tried to turn the differences into an advantage, using them to signal both sides that the best the president could work out was a compromise that would leave everyone a little unhappy.

HEADLINE: Campaigning for 2 Bushes: One in 2002, One in 2004 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Fla., March 8 

 BODY:
Floridians got another first-hand look at President Bush today, their eighth since he took the oath of office, suggesting that if any of them have forgotten the 36-day election recount crisis of 2000, the White House has not.
 In a campaign trip intended to lift the political fortunes of Mr. Bush in 2004 as well as those of his brother Gov. Jeb Bush, who is up for re-election this November, the president spoke against corporate "shenanigans," said he would sign an economic stimulus bill passed by the Senate and lauded what he described as the "fabulous" American military. 
 Then Mr. Bush helped raise $500,000 for the state Republican Party, the White House said. Much of the money was expected to go to Jeb Bush's re-election effort, since the state party pays for most of the governor's campaign expenses.
"By helping me, you're going to help this great president of the United States," Jeb Bush told a crowd of several hundred people at a fund-raiser at the Don CeSar Beach Resort and Spa. "George, I know you know this, and everybody in this room knows it, that one vote does make a difference."
Jeb Bush's remark, a reference to his brother's official 537-vote margin of victory in Florida over Al Gore in the 2000 presidential campaign, was met with knowing laughter.
In his remarks, Mr. Bush forcefully promoted his brother's campaign. "I told Jeb I'll do anything he wants me to do to get him elected," Mr. Bush said.
As he does now at nearly every stop in his weekly travels to crucial electoral states, Mr. Bush also spoke about his campaign against terrorism. In remarks at an electronics company before the fund-raiser, he singled out the families of two American soldiers from Florida, Sergeant Bradley Crose and Specialist Marc Anderson. The two were among the servicemen killed in Afghanistan on Monday.
"I know your heart aches, and we ache for you," Mr. Bush said to Mr. Crose's parents and Mr. Anderson's brother and sister-in-law, who were sitting at the front of a crowd of several hundred employees of America II Electronics Inc., a microchip distributor. The president wiped tears from his eyes and choked up as he spoke.
"I hate it, to know that young soldiers are at risk," Mr. Bush said. A short time later, he reaffirmed that hunting down terrorists was still his central focus.
Mr. Bush also reviewed the important points of what the White House is calling his "corporate responsibility" plan, a response to the Enron debacle that the president unveiled this week in a speech at the Washington Hilton. Mr. Bush said, among other things, that executives should be forced to surrender millions of dollars in compensation if their company's financial statements proved inaccurate, as was the case with Enron.
"These guys should not be allowed to keep their bonuses," Mr. Bush said to applause. 
Democrats have criticized Mr. Bush's response to the Enron collapse as tepid, and Florida Democratic officials, who pointed out that the state pension fund lost more than $300 million because of investments in Enron stock, were quick to do so again today. Jeb Bush is one of three people on the state pension fund's board.
"It's got no teeth," said Bob Poe, the chairman of the Florida Democratic Party, in a conference call this afternoon with reporters. "And it's too little, too late, for Florida."

 CROSSING OVER
A Mexican Family on the Migrant Trail.
By Ruben Martinez.
Illustrated. 328 pp. New York:
Metropolitan Books/Henry Holt & Company. $26.
 On the front lines, Ruben Martinez observes early in "Crossing Over," the struggle between illegal immigrants and American border patrol agents has come to resemble a low-intensity conflict: the fighting is irregular and largely unseen; the casualties are steady but come in numbers small enough to leave the public imagination mostly unstirred.
Since the Clinton administration began tightening border controls in the mid-1990's, in part to neutralize a political issue that had been used effectively by Republicans, the body count has been rising all along the southern border of the United States. The border patrol made it tougher for illegal immigrants to sneak across into cities like San Diego and El Paso, so the immigrants began taking longer, more arduous routes through the desert. Predictably, many more have perished along the way.
Among the untold victims of the conflict were Benjamin, Salvador and Jaime Chavez, brothers who had left their home in Mexico to find work in the strawberry fields of Watsonville, Calif. Like many people from Cheran, their hardscrabble town in the central state of Michoacan, the brothers had made the journey before. But just before dawn on April 6, 1996, the small truck in which they were traveling flipped over as it sped away from border patrol agents near Temecula, Calif., about an hour's drive north of the border. Eight of the 27 illegals packed into the truck were killed, and the Chavez family was devastated.
Martinez, an associate editor at Pacific News Service and the grandson of Mexican immigrants, was not the only journalist to visit Cheran in the aftermath of the accident, but he was surely the only one who kept going back. The basic question he asks -- why do they continue to come when the risks are so obviously great? -- is not new. Nor are the answers he hears particularly original. What is often extraordinary, though, is the force with which those answers come across.
In a series of visits over two years, Martinez visits with the Chavezes, goes to church with them and gets drunk with them. He listens sympathetically as they struggle with the losses of the three brothers and the income they sent home. At any moment, most of their town's able-bodied men and many of its women are scattered across the American low-wage landscape, from the farms of California's Central Valley to the slaughterhouses of the rural South. But if "the other side" has always been on Cheran's horizon, the choices that the Chavez family faces are set in stark new relief by the tragedy.
Rosa, the 21-year-old sister, believes she should stay home with her grieving mother but longs to return to St. Louis and its freedom from village notions of Mexican womanhood. Her husband, Wense, knows that the family needs him in Cheran, but also that it needs the money he can earn working on a Missouri farm. Another Chavez son, Florentino, stays in Watsonville to keep the family afloat, but he finishes off his long days in the fields by drinking himself to sleep in a run-down trailer.
In Cheran, the Chavez family live in a Mexico That Nafta Forgot. Eight years after the trade agreement took effect, its promise of new jobs and higher wages is almost invisible. For men in town, the job opportunities don't go much beyond tapping resin from the pine forests, working in a sawmill or building tables from wooden scraps. The money that migrants send home supports a restaurant, a bar and a few cantinas, but new business amounts to little more than a store or two that stock auto parts and baseball caps that say "Raiders" to capitalize on the migrant fashion.
What lures Mexicans north, Martinez observes, are values and ideas as well as the economics. Poor young couples choose between putting their children to work after the sixth grade or putting them into American public schools. Women weigh their traditional roles in the home against a life in which they can get jobs, drive cars and perhaps persuade their husbands to help with the housework. One family, the Tapias, has found a familiar vision of home in Warren, Ark.: "a verdant, peaceful place, with the pastoral rhythms that are slowly being eroded away in Cheran."
At its best, Martinez's portrait is a rich counterpoint to the simple patterns a demographer might draw. The Cheranes, as people from the town are called, come and go and live in both countries at once. One of Cheran's traditional curanderas, or healers, has set up shop in Cobden, Ill., population 1,090. The local slackers join in a hybrid pop culture that is at once Mexican and American, Indian, country and hip-hop. The hard-working Enriquez family thrives in central Wisconsin, but its sons yearn for the freedoms of life back in Cheran: the freedom to crank up the volume on their music or to drink a beer on the sidewalk in front of one's home. 
The book has some flaws. When Martinez gets away from the Chavezes and Cheran, his anecdotes tend to take on a kitchen-sink feel, as in long passages about the workings of an Arkansas slaughterhouse or the vagaries of Mexican street kids on the border. He has a fine ear for language, but the poor Mexicans he meets sometimes speak in strangely lyrical sentences. At times, Martinez's great sympathy for the immigrants is undercut by his cartoonish rendering of the people they encounter in the United States -- the cruel white bosses, the racist white neighbors, the shock troops of the Border Patrol.
The politics of American immigration policy are also a lot more complex than Martinez allows. With the Republicans trying to court Latino voters and President Bush eager to strengthen relations with Mexico, Washington embarked last summer on what might have been the most significant rethinking of immigration policy in years. While that process slammed to a halt on Sept. 11, Americans should think carefully about whether the sort of changes that were being considered for Mexican immigrants are really impossible in a context of tightened borders. As Martinez makes clear, America's attraction for such newcomers will always be stronger than its ability to keep them out.

 BODY:
 THE NEWS ABOUT
THE NEWS
American Journalism in Peril.
By Leonard Downie Jr.
and Robert G. Kaiser.
292 pp. New York:
Alfred A. Knopf. $25.
 The good news in this important book by the executive editor and the former managing editor of The Washington Post is the bad news. Hold the thought. (Statement of interest: I've known the authors for years, but there's a tradition in our business of being able to critique one another's work fairly, and I hope I can maintain it.) 
Now for this report. In the late 1970's Los Angeles television stations traded in their Sacramento bureaus for helicopters. The payoff -- choppers tracking police highway chases on Los Angeles freeways at prime time -- came only some years later, with the advent of "camera stabilizers and powerful lenses that zoom in on targets from thousands of feet away," but now it defines a good Southern California TV news day. In 1998, station KTLA broadcast live the moment when a driver set his truck on fire and shot himself. Television industry consulting outfits now offer client stations prepackaged stories that they can plug into newscasts -- a homogenized, cost-cutting mix of "investigations, health probes, consumer alerts" and other "hot topics." 
At the national level the network news anchors agree that their mission, at best, is to still be here tomorrow, and that the proposition is iffy. Dan Rather speaks of the disappearance of network "confidence in our ability to get and maintain an audience large enough for survival, much less to thrive"; Peter Jennings talks of "our own uncertainty about who we are and our commitment in this new marketplace." Tom Brokaw says the young "children of television" coming to work at NBC are "smarter than they've ever been" but don't care about the news. "They want to do magazines or they want to do talk shows." 
Leonard Downie Jr. and Robert G. Kaiser hardly need to fault television news, so thick is the vein of self-indictment in what the television people themselves have to say. But talk is cheap. The anchors are allowed to invoke the ghost of Edward R. Murrow because it's an easy way for their bosses to allow them to let off steam. Others in top television news roles settle for the syrup of self-congratulatory rationalization -- as in the mission to "find new modes of making news interesting and compelling entertainment." Jennings may call magazine shows like NBC's "Dateline" and ABC's "20/20" "very serious bottom feeders," but the NBC News president, Andrew Lack, says they'd be much worse if they were "produced by an entertainment division" rather than by "serious journalists."
All this has happened, of course, in a larger context. The rising demands of the profit imperative against a backdrop of public distraction have yielded the soft porn of network "reality" programming, the elimination of taboos on cable and a mix of desperation and opportunism across the board in commercial TV, which the words of the news division journalists and executives echo. Plainly, it's only a matter of time before "audience retention" and profitability justify showing whatever it is you used to imagine couldn't be broadcast for reasons of taste. 
How is it that some newspapers (a declining minority of them, as the authors punctuate anew) are able to retain the commitment to public service and to news that is now leaking fast from the frail vessels bearing Rather, Brokaw, Jennings & Company? Many of the pressures are the same: decline of audiences, fragmentation of markets, loss of independent ownership to corporate conglomerating, the tyranny of Wall Street's reviews of short-term financial performance and so forth. Many of the responses are the same too: in the name
of profitability, reduce news staff and costs; shift managerial decision making from a concern with news and public service to a focus on marketing and the bottom line. But at a handful of newspapers a sense of higher calling is as ingrained, and at least as minimally assured, as it is not in commercial television. 
Why? No room or need to reprise all that's been recorded about the vast differences in origin and culture between television and newspapers, or about the different ways we absorb and process print and visual media. Less discussed is the difference in geographic identity. Newspapers (excepting USA Today and, to an extent, The Wall Street Journal) remain metropolitan at a basic level of origin, identity and function. They're thus organized to play watchdog for and advertise to a relatively coherent, identifiable community -- people who care about the news. The television networks have no such cohesive sense of audience. They connect to vast, faceless numbers, demographics and hair-trigger channel switchers -- the great blur of the national mass -- not to daily subscribers and newsstand purchasers. Peter Jennings told the authors, "I don't think we have the vaguest idea on many days who it is we're broadcasting to." 
Now the good news, which we come to by a detour. This book was sent to press before Sept. 11, but the authors managed to insert salute after salute to the old-fashioned professional response of commercial television, as well as most print media, to the terrorist attacks. They sing bracing reprises of the theme that the "attacks revived interest in serious journalism," and reinforced the common-sense truth that "there is no obvious way to simultaneously shrink" a news organization "and make it better." But they also concede that the point is mostly rhetorical. For the damage is already done where it hurts. ABC News executives discouraged the authors from imagining that the immediate post-Sept. 11 model of news coverage "is the way it's going to be from now on." 
So journalistic response to Sept. 11 spells limbic instinct and ritual memory, not reawakening. A much better prospect for the thousands of journalists and millions of citizens who care about serious news coverage is what the authors document as the galloping differentiation between formulaic, mechanical and trivial journalism ("new media" headline services and local TV and newspapers that look and read like them) and what a top editor quoted here calls coverage delivered to readers "at a depth or a detail or with the sophistication they can't get elsewhere." The fortuitously happy effect of this differentiation, especially as recession drives those most in the thrall of short-term financial goals to deeper and deeper downsizing, is that our handful of well-staffed, respected "old news" organizations are forced to a new realization of the worth of their franchises. Walter Lippmann called for such an outcome 80 years ago on the basis of social analysis. Today the market drives it. 
Downie and Kaiser offer valuable firsthand insights into how The Washington Post and other papers have kept the faith, and they are not self-serving. Their reporting on journalism's bottom-feeders, and on those driving news organizations in that direction, is easily worth the price of the book. They are quite as tough on print peers, such as those at the helm of the once very good Knight-Ridder newspaper chain, who have systematically decimated their newsroom strengths to lighten the load for profitability and Wall Street approval. 
Perhaps inevitably, theirs is the kind of collaboration that yields a somewhat plodding, committee-written prose. More troubling is their failure to scratch the surface of the deeper historical forces at work in the turn of so much of the industry and its audiences alike from a news orientation to an entertainment one. They simply repeat that it has happened. And despite bows to critical thought from within what might be called today's organized religion of journalism, they fail to cite those writing from outside the cathedral, who have gone before in exploring such issues, and have often been treated dismissively for doing so. I'll mention only James Fallows, as "The News About the News" does not. Downie and Kaiser have much to say about "the rise of journalism about celebrities . . . accompanied by the rise of celebrity journalists." Citing facts, figures and original interviews, Fallows compared the latter six years ago in his "Breaking the News" to "the first limbed fish who struggled their way out of the sea to set up life on land. . . . The features that let the fish live on land -- lungs not gills, legs not fins -- were at direct odds with what it took to survive in the old environment. And the traits that are rewarded, through processes of selection, in the talk-show age are at direct odds with what 'reporters' have traditionally done." Fallows said it better.

 HOMO ZAPIENS
By Victor Pelevin.
Translated by Andrew Bromfield.
250 pp. New York:
Viking. $24.95.
 "CORRUPTION," Gibbon wrote in "The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire," is "the most infallible symptom of constitutional liberty." One imagines the observation sending a grim smile of recognition across the features of the Russian novelist Victor Pelevin, whose scalding satires of the moral bankruptcy of post-Communist Russia have won praise in the United States and Europe, and whose admirers see him as the natural heir of Gogol and Bulgakov.
His latest novel, "Homo Zapiens," sees Pelevin again wielding the scourge on the rump of a country that, freed from the toils of Soviet power, has become a byword for greed and opportunism. In Moscow, an air of uncertainty prevails: the streets are "flooded with Mercedes and Toyotas," while Lenin's statues are toppled and carted away in army trucks -- and on television "they were saying exactly the same things they used to jail other people for, except that they were far bolder, far more decisive and radical."
A bemused witness to these galloping changes is the novel's hero, Tatarsky, once an aspiring poet, now a shop assistant. Like most of his fellow citizens, he can't understand "why it was worth exchanging an evil empire for an evil banana republic that imported its bananas from Finland." But then Tatarsky is less concerned with understanding these developments than surviving them -- or exploiting them. In time, he too is infected with the virus of free-market corruption after stumbling upon a profession that is peculiarly congenial to him. With goods pouring in from the West, there is suddenly a huge demand for advertising -- what's more, advertising that will have to be adapted for the Russian consumer. A chance meeting propels Tatarsky into the business of copywriting, for which he discovers an unsuspected talent. But he has no sooner pocketed his first money than the client is found dead, strangled with a telephone cord. Clearly there is peril lurking within the new prosperity: " 'One generation passeth away and another generation cometh,' Tatarsky thought philosophically, 'but thou lookest out always for number one.' "
Pelevin has fun with the smoke and mirrors of Tatarsky's new trade, and a blizzard of brand names blows through the novel's early chapters. As Tatarsky's reputation as a writer -- or, rather, a "creative" -- blooms, he seeks distractions in his leisure time, bingeing on hallucinogenic mushrooms, cocaine and acid. For a while, "Homo Zapiens" speeds along merrily on this cocktail of riffs, spoofs and trips. (It is translated with an impressively idiomatic touch by Andrew Bromfield). Pelevin regards Russia's inchoate consumer culture with disgust and fascination -- both equally vital fuels to the satirist -- and surrounds his hero with a promising gallery of gangsters, con men and assorted no-goodniks. The novel seems poised to vault in the same direction as Martin Amis's "Money," a manic romp through 1980's New York in which an adman tries to sate a runaway appetite for sex, booze and drugs.
The expectation is not met. Tatarsky, though certainly partial to chemical abuse, proves a rather more civilized and temperate character, and Pelevin turns out to be less interested in the propulsion of narrative than in a kind of antic theorizing. He propounds an economic template of the ideal consumer, Homo Zapiens, who is subject through advertising to three factors known as the oral, the anal and the displacing "wow impulses." These impulses, all centering on the getting and spending of money, are elucidated over 14 pages of closely argued text, a screed dictated to Tatarsky, incidentally, through a Ouija board consultation with the spirit of Che Guevara.
Confused? You will be -- and perhaps a little bored, too. For while Pelevin's nutty metaphysics and its unlikely conduit evince a bizarre imaginative skew, they do nothing for the story's momentum. In fact, "Homo Zapiens" reads more like an end-of-term skit worked up by a class of bright economics students: tremendous fun for those who have labored through the course work, but of limited interest to anybody else. The Ouija episode is also an ominous indication of things to come. From this point, the novel's purpose seems divided between the picaresque (Tatarsky's adventures with hallucinogenics) and the theoretical (Pelevin's vaguely Burroughsian preoccupation with conspiracy and mind control), without either strand achieving a satisfactory fit with the other.
The informing idea, that "reality" is infinitely manipulable and corruptible, is pursued with increasingly phantasmagoric invention. Tatarsky is versed, among other things, in the mysteries of the Institute of Apiculture (where a virtual-reality system can perfectly duplicate politicians), Buddhist ways of watching television and, latterly, a crash course in Egyptian mythology. The novel's last section lurches toward the daft excesses of "The Mummy," though this would be to suggest a raciness and energy that "Homo Zapiens" doesn't manage. Victor Pelevin may have the goods on the state of contemporary Russia, and maybe even the state of contemporary advertising, but the flights of fancy that constitute the latter half of this book induce not so much moral vertigo as long-haul ennui.

SPRINGING

In a skiff on a sunrisen lake we are watchers.

Swimming aimlessly is luxury, just as walking
loudly up a shallow stream is.

As we lean over the deep well, we whisper.

Friends at hearths are drawn to the one warm air;
strangers meet on beaches drawn to the one wet sea.

What wd it be to be water, one body of water
(what water is is another mystery.) (We are
water divided.) It wd be a self without walls,
with surface tension, specific gravity, a local
exchange between bedrock and cloud of falling and rising,
rising to fall, falling to rise. Marie Ponsot

HEADLINE: FRUGAL TRAVELER; 
In Oaxaca, Tourists, Weavers and Cooks

BYLINE:  By DAISANN McLANE 

 BODY:
On the eight-hour bus ride from Veracruz to Oaxaca I met a retired fellow from Arkansas who wore his long white hair in a ponytail and used the e-mail moniker El Viejo Gringo. He was in a mood to chat; I was not. But as we glided up steep mountain ridges covered with giant cactus, I found his colorful stories far more entertaining than the Spanish-dubbed reruns of "Hawaii Five-O" on the bus's TV screen.
 El Viejo had just spent two months in a Veracruz hotel so cheap that I had thought it was a house of ill repute when I passed it during my stay. He was planning to change buses in Oaxaca, and not linger there an instant longer than necessary. "Too many gringos," he said, waving his hand dismissively. "Too expensive." 
 Oaxaca was, indeed, full of Americans. At times during my six-day stay there in February, I felt as if I'd wandered into an adult version of college spring break or semester abroad. From groups on an Elderhostel learning tour, to retired couples pausing to visit museums, ancient Zapotecan and Mixtec ruins and take a cooking class, to baby boomers immersed in intensive Spanish courses, I ran into folks from home at the turn of every colonial cobblestone street. (Oaxaca, founded in the 1500's, has some of the richest Spanish colonial architecture in the Americas.) 
At first this didn't make me happy at all. One travels to a foreign country, in part, to have a vacation from one's own. On my first morning I ambled out of my room at the guest house Las Golondrinas, through a Mexican patio garden dripping with potted geraniums and fragrant citrus trees. The air was crisp, the sky azure; Oaxaca, tucked into a mile-high valley surrounded by dry, rugged mountains, has a year-round springlike high desert climate. But then, slipping into a seat at a small table in the garden breakfast area, I nearly got up and fled back into my room when a boisterous chorus of "Well, hi there! Where are you from?!" rose from the American guests nearby.
When I got over being a grouch -- and moved my breakfast from the guest house to Del Jardin, a very Mexican outdoor cafe facing the busy central public square, or zocalo, I soon discovered the bright side of Oaxaca's popularity. Because it receives so many visitors, Oaxaca is well organized for them, and almost embarrassingly easy (and inexpensive) to explore. On my first morning, it took me only about five minutes to find the office of the Cooperative Society of Community Museums, two blocks from Las Golondrinas. Besides helping more than two dozen indigenous villages build and maintain town museums, the society takes small groups of travelers out to the Zapotecan and Mixtec communities for day trips. The travelers, with a local guide, visit weavers, potters and other artisans, take hikes into nearby mountains and fields, visit the museums, and eat lunch at a village house.
While I could have hopped on one of those noisy Oaxaca buses and gone to an outlying village myself, visiting a community with an invitation and a local guide seemed like a far better way to learn about Oaxacan Indian culture -- and, at a cost of about $20, including lunch (all tour profits go directly back to the villages), a great deal, too. At the office I signed up for a visit to Santa Ana del Valle, about nine miles east of Oaxaca city, for later in the week.
Even easier was finding my way into Oaxaca's legendary cuisine. That evening, as I finished the last bites of a scrumptious plate of chilies delicately stuffed with squash blossoms at El Naranjo restaurant, a woman I took to be the chef (she was) came to my table and asked me how I liked my meal.
"Fantastic," I gushed. "I would love to learn how to cook like this."
Without further ado, I suddenly found myself enrolled in Iliana de la Vega's Oaxacan cooking class for that coming Saturday morning ($44).
Figuring I'd arranged enough organized activity, I set about the serious work of aimlessly strolling around town. Away from the main tourist area -- which includes the Cathedral of Santo Domingo, the expensive Camino Real hotel (housed in a converted 16th-century convent), and a narrow pedestrian street called Alcala lined with pricey shops -- Oaxaca is a more down to earth, typical Mexican city. On side streets, schoolchildren in uniform romp, market vendors struggle with huge baskets of vegetables or heaps of the woven wool rugs -- tapetes -- that Oaxacan artisans are famous for. Again and again, I returned to the zocalo, always abuzz with activity, from children tossing enormous balloons in the air to the local orchestra playing Verdi.
Even more of a treat was Oaxaca's public food market, just off the main square. It held treasure troves of goodies, some I recognized (like shiny black candied figs), and some I did not (heaps of pungent dried chilies of every size and color, and mounds of dark paste, the bases of Oaxaca's famous moles, or sauces). Smells I understood mingled with unfathomable ones, and I couldn't wait for my cooking class, which I hoped would unravel some of the market's mysteries.
Which it did, and in a way I hadn't expected. For, among my 10 fellow American and Canadian students at the Naranjo cooking class was Phil, who introduced himself to us as "a chef from a Berkeley restaurant." Figuring that "Berkeley restaurant" was modest code for Chez Panisse (it was), I struck up a conversation with him as we all chopped tomatoes and tomatillos in Ms. de la Vega's restaurant kitchen, and discovered that he had prepped extensively for his exploration of Oaxacan cuisine, and was carrying a thick file of tips and info from other chefs he knew who'd already made the pilgrimage.
Meanwhile, Ms. de la Vega led us through the many stages of preparation of a Oaxacan chile relleno, from preparing the shredded pork stuffing to the right way to blister and peel the skin of a dark green chile poblano. It may be a while before I attempt such a heavy and intricate dish in my home kitchen, but I will certainly whip up a batch of salsa made from slightly toasted chiles de aguas that Ms. de la Vega demonstrated that morning. And, with the cooking finished came the highlight of the class -- for me, not lunch (although it was delicious) but a guided trip into that formidable market, where Ms. de la Vega explained the fine points of distinguishing a chile ancho from a chile pasilla (the pasilla is smoked, smaller and darker), and guided us to some of the friendlier vendors.
LATER, over tequilas at La Purisima, a pleasant new rooftop restaurant with a view of the Cathedral, Phil shared some of his kitchen files with me. On his recommendation, I visited El Topil, a little restaurant, for lunch, where I had a quesadilla that knocked me out with its classic, simple flavors: a handmade corn tortilla and local string cheese topped with an epazote leaf (which tastes like a cross between mint and coriander). Poking my nose into the open kitchen to compliment the cook, I found that Dona Carmelita Hernandez Pacheco had been preparing these quesadillas at El Topil for 16 years.
After only a few days in Oaxaca, I was beginning to feel like a seminar participant, too. It was a feeling that intensified as I met my Museo Comunitario guide, Rosa Sosa Ignacio, early one morning in front of her office. Along with a couple from New Zealand, we boarded a crowded public bus, then transferred to another for the hourlong ride out to Santa Ana del Valle, a Zapotecan village that had once been a suburb of the ancient Zapotecan capital, Monte Alban, whose ruins I had visited the previous afternoon.
Upon entering Santa Ana, with its tidy houses, neat flower-filled square, and simple white church, its altar awash in vases of gladioli, I felt as if I had walked into one of the fantasy villages in a Gabriel Garcia Marquez novel. In the square, Rosa passed us on to Jose Rodriguez, our village guide, who took us up a dirt road leading from the village. Soon we were in a vast, dry high plain filled with agave plants and scrubby trees and shrubs. The air grew cooler and thinner, as Jose explained how each of the shrubs and plants figured into the local economy -- some were medicinal, others used to make the vegetable dyes for the weavers' wool (Santa Ana is renowned for the artistry of its tapetes) -- and described the way the village of 2,000 people is run, as a cooperative of volunteer leaders and committees.
Returning to the village, we visited the home of a master weaver named Primo, who demonstrated making a wide wool blanket on a loom that reminded me of a pipe organ -- and that required a similar intricate coordination of hands and feet.
Finally it was time for lunch: homemade sausages, rice, plate-size handmade tortillas, and a sweet, thick soup made from squash, served in the home of the village school principal and his wife. Jose mentioned that visitors can stay in peaceful Santa Ana, either in the simple guest house or with a family. I asked what it might cost, and our host, the school principal, piped up, "I charge about 25 pesos a day." That's $2.70. 
I would have jumped at the chance to enjoy an idyll in this friendly village, if only time allowed. Instead I made a note to send an e-mail message to the one person who I knew would most appreciate a pointer to an inexpensive Mexican place with few, if any, fellow Americans: "Dear Viejo Gringo . . ." 

Bottom line: kitchen to zocalo
 I spent $79 a day on food,lodging, and activities during six days and nights in Oaxaca.

Transportation
 There are no direct flights from the New York City area to either Veracruz, the first stop on my Mexican trip, or Oaxaca. I bought an open-jaw ticket through www.onetravel.com that routed me from J.F.K. to Veracruz, with a change of plane in Cancun, then returned from Oaxaca, with a change in Mexico City. The round-trip fare was $749.
I traveled the eight hours from Veracruz to Oaxaca in a first class bus for about $23 one way. The bus, a reasonably comfortable air-conditioned model with a Mercedes engine, is operated by a regional company called ADO (pronounced ah-day-oh, for Autobuses de Oriente), whose number in Oaxaca is (52-951) 515-1703; it's probably easiest and best to check the latest schedules and fares in person at the station.

Hotels
 I inspected about six Oaxaca guest houses in the $35 price range, and Las Golondrinas, Tinoco y Palacios 411, (52-951) 514-3298, impressed me as the best value. Its 27 rooms are all different, arranged around several small garden courtyards. Mine had a main room with a double bed and wardrobe, an alcove with a desk, and a private bath with shower, sink, toilet but no tub. The room was dark, however, and I was disturbed by noise both from the street and from chatty fellow guests in the courtyard.
On my last night I treated myself to a stay in the somewhat faded but still grand Marques del Valle hotel, Portal de Claveria, Centro Oaxaca, (52-951) 514-0688, fax (523-951) 516-9961, a period 1940's gem with Deco and Art Nouveau details that boasts a ringside view of the zocalo. My spacious room overlooking the square, with two double beds and private bath, cost $68.55 (reflecting a 15 percent discount for paying cash).
The Posada Catarina, Aldama 325, telephone and fax (52-951) 516-4270, newer and not as beautifully landscaped as Las Golondrinas, has similarly tidy rooms, a friendly management -- and a location somewhat protected from street noise. I was quoted $38 for a single room with bath.
Moving somewhat more upscale, I also like the newish Hotel Calesa Real, Garcia Vigil 306, (52-951) 516-5544 fax: (52-951) 526-7232, which has standard, spacious hotel-style rooms arranged around a pretty courtyard with a little swimming pool. I was quoted a rate of almost $100, but that instantly dropped to $57 as soon as I mentioned the word "descuento."

Restaurants
 At El Naranjo, Valerio Trujano 203, (52-951) 514-1878, www.elnaranjo.com.mx, whose chef and owner puts a modern spin on traditional cuisine, my chilies stuffed with squash blossoms were elegant and flavorful; with a glass of tequila and an appetizer, dinner was about $17.
El Topil, Plazuela Labastida 104, no telephone, is an informal place with classic, flavorful food. My lunch of garbanzo soup and quesadillas filled with string cheese cost $8.45.
The cool, flower-laden terrace of La Purisima, Allende 208, (52-951) 501-0927, with its stunning view of the cathedral and mountains, is a good place to be at sunset. I had a big appetizer platter that included sausages, pressed beef, cheeses and chilies and two expensive tequilas for $22.
Breakfast of coffee, fruit, and toast at del Jardin, one of several cafes facing the zocalo, cost around $5.

Activities
 The cooking class taught by Iliana de la Vega at her restaurant, El Na ranjo, cost $44, including materials, a huge lunch, and a tour of the food market. Reservations are suggested. 
Tours of local villages are arranged through the Sociedad Cooperativo de Museos Comunitarios del Estado de Oaxaca, Tinoco y Palacios 311-312; telephone and fax (52-951) 516-5786, www.umco.org. My day in Santa Ana del Valle, with lunch, cost $20. Village stays can be arranged.
Monte Alban is about two miles from downtown Oaxaca. A round-trip taxi cost about $13 (including waiting time); the entry fee is $3.90. DAISANN McLANE

What They Were Thinking

BYLINE:  By Robert Mackey 

 BODY:
A portfolio of images of small-business owners taken near the World Trade Center on Feb. 22.

Filip Jakaj (left) and Frank Djerdjaj, Little Italy Pizza, 11 Park Place.
Djerdjaj: "I'm Albanian, from Kosovo. I've been in New York 15 years. Most of the Albanians who come to this country first go to Italy, and they learn the style of Italian life there, cooking and this and that, and so when they come here they start working as pizza guys -- and they work hard and they take over. As the owner, I've been here nine years. It was a really good location -- last year we just signed a new lease, a 15-year lease, upgraded the store, with all brand-new marble, spent a fortune, and then Sept. 11 came. When they opened the viewing platform there, the line was actually ending up in this block, so we were fortunate for like a week or so, but then when they got in with tickets, then there was no line anymore. But there's a god out there. We'll get back."

Mukesh Patel, Park Place and Church Street:
"I took over this business about two years ago. I don't own the stand, but it's like I'm subletting. They're not taking any rent from me right now, because, you know, the guy is good, a nice person, and he understands everything. Slowly, slowly people are coming back, but business is very slow. The main problem is a family problem. My two sons and my father and mother are still in India, and my wife is here. My sons are coming here for the first time in April or May to see if they like it, to stay here. My father and mother have been here two times, but both have had bypass surgery, and you know here the cold is too much sometimes, so in summertime it's all right, but they don't like wintertime here."

Tony Romano, Hair Today, 150 Fulton Street:
"I've been working in this area for 40 years, since I came from Italy. My first job was on Cortlandt Street, exactly where they put the trade center later. I've been able to survive because I'm on the second floor -- some of the hair salons on the ground floors, which have a very high rent, can't make it now. My landlord, the Collegiate Church, is not giving us a break on rent. The only break is that for six months, from October until March, they deferred one-third of the rent -- only deferred. Then I've got to start to pay it back on top of the regular rent.
 But this is what I like to do. I talk to people. In this business you've got to talk to people. If you don't want to talk to them, they talk to you anyway."

Mitchell Kikoen, Mitchell's Place Jewelers, 18 Park Place:
"I've been in this exact location since 1975. You know, I'm not only a jeweler, I'm woven into the community. Everybody knows me. I'd enjoy when people would stop by and we'd chitchat, and it's a big piece of your heart that's missing when it's not like that anymore. We had a respectable Christmas, we had a respectable Valentine's Day -- but we have a lot more awful days than we ever used to. There is tourist traffic in the neighborhood, but we're on a side street, and they're looking for pins and caps -- they're not the ones walking in to buy diamonds and fine neckpieces; that's really reserved for the corporate people that know me, know my reputation for so long. Only people that know us come to see us. It's like a clubhouse atmosphere -- we're a very personable store. The silver lining in the dark cloud is that like most Americans, most New Yorkers, people have bonded in a more adhesive way than ever before."

Susan Bergen and Ronnie Ferber, Atlas Security Hardware Corp., 130 Church Street.
Bergen: "There's a lot of businesses suffering down here. You don't hear it on the news anymore -- it's like we're old news. The creditors, the bill collectors still call, and we tell them we were affected severely, because we're still in the restricted zone. And they say, 'That was six months ago.' They think it's just gone away."

Ferber: "It's called the Immediate Zone now -- from Chambers down and from Broadway over. They're promising grants to the businesses down here for rent, but nothing's come through yet. We're just waiting. The answer is to stay and be here, so as it picks up, we're here for it, hopefully in a few months, or maybe in a year or two. We're not going anywhere." interviews by Robert Mackey

HEADLINE: PRACTICAL TRAVELER; 
Exotic Trips For Eco-Tourists

BYLINE:  By MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON; MARTHA STEVENSON OLSON is a freelance writer living in San Diego.

 BODY:
YOU'RE awake at 4 a.m., preparing to set out into the wetlands of the Okavango Delta of Botswana in search of the Nile crocodile, an efficient predator that grows to 18 feet. It is your vacation, but you are part of a research team that checks crocodile traps to measure and weigh the reptiles, as well as take blood samples, check for parasites, pump out their stomach contents, and tag them for identification. Halfway through the 13-day study tour, you will take the night shift, traveling by boat to conduct spotlight counts and capture smaller crocodiles by noose or by hand. 
 Such vacations -- call them extreme eco-tours -- are becoming more popular. They may be run in collaboration with scientists, with nonprofit organizations like Earthwatch, which has organized the crododile study, or both. Some participants are looking for a jaw-dropping travel story and radical change of scenery; others are aware how fast pristine nature is disappearing and want to experience it firsthand. Many end up contributing their travel dollars and personal efforts to worthy environmental causes. 
 The comfort level can vary widely: Some expeditions involve sleeping on cots in tents or on mats in tribal huts; others are based at safari camps or hotels with every luxury. (Prices tend to be land-only, and often include some or all meals.) 

A World of Choices
Travelers with an altruistic bent should try to determine how much of an opportunity they will have to make a contribution at their destinations. Owners of tour companies range from passionate idealists who want to aid conservation and local enterprise, to entrepreneurs riding a lucrative wave. Some nonprofit organizations offer tours where the traveler pays a fee and enjoys the ride; others take paying volunteers who contribute their time and effort.
A one-stop resource for thousands of special-interest and adventure tours is Specialty Travel Index. It has a free catalog at www .specialtytravel.com; a color magazine, mailed twice a year, costs $10. Information: (800) 442-4922. 
For the think-globally-act-locally ethic at its most basic, visit the grass-roots entrepreneurs at EarthFoot (www.earthfoot.org). These are naturalists who design and conduct their own tours, people like Bony Scott, a Costa Rican bird-watcher who takes visitors on his boat up the canals of the Tortuguero region (two days, $150), or Karma Jamtsho, a birder from Bhutan whose 15-day sample itinerary (from $200 a person a night) lists 54 avian species an eco-tourist might see.
Forum International, a California company, says it coined the term eco-tourism back in 1965, when it set forth "four pillars" of responsible travel: minimum environmental impact; minimum impact on -- and maximum respect for -- host cultures; maximum economic benefits to a host country's grass roots, and maximum recreational satisfaction to tourists.
Its tours range from "mild to wild": from nine-day Huck Finn in Romania raft and camping trips down the Mures River in June, July and August ($788, without air fare)to scuba diving in Antarctica, a tour now under way and planned again next February and March (13 days from $5,370). Information: (800) 252-4475; www.foruminternational.com. Forum International also identifies eco-friendly, locally operated lodges and helps design vacations around them, at www.hidden-lodges.com.
Discovery Initiatives is a British agency dedicated to conserving and sustaining local economies. Many of the tours are organized in conjunction with foundations like the World Wildlife Fund and the Jane Goodall Institute. Some trips include working with researchers to track and collect data, for example, a ground survey of lions in Botswana's Okavango Delta, with seven departures from April to October (nine days for $3,715, including air fare from London, at $1.46 to the pound); Information: (44-1285) 643-333 or at www .discoveryinitiatives.com. 
Another operator dedicated to minimal impact and maximum interaction is G.A.P Adventures, an 11-year-old company based in Toronto. Focusing on developing countries, G.A.P tours use fairly basic accommodations and, often, public transportation to attract younger budget travelers. One offering, for instance, is a 46-day journey between Mexico City and San Jose, Costa Rica, that includes stops at most of the major ruins and attractions through the Yucatan, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. It is offered twice a month and priced at $2,415 a person without meals; (800) 692-5495 or www.GAPadventures.com. 
Directed at a better-heeled clientele, Geographic Expeditions, formerly InnerAsia, has 21 years of experience in organizing expeditions and treks. Although not advertised as eco-tours, the trips tend to plunge visitors into the thick of remote places, and in some cases, travelers have contributed to local humanitarian or conservation projects. For instance, part of the cost of the Hidden Tribes of China tour in April and October (14 days from $4,895) will go to buy a water buffalo for a Miao village. Information: (800) 777-8183 or www.geoex.com.
Cheesemans' Ecology Safaris is a family business in Saratoga, Calif., that concentrates on viewing and photographing wildlife. Groups are generally limited to 12 to 18 and always to nonsmokers. An example is a trip to the southern and eastern areas of Brazil from Aug. 5 to 30 that will take up to 12 people to see endangered primates, other rain forest mammals and birds. The cost: $6,700, land only; (800) 527-5330 or www.cheesemans.com. 
Wilderness Travel is another leader in the field of exotic expeditions, among them a four-day trek across a roadless section of Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean during a trip there Aug. 30 to Sept. 8 (from $2,790). Another is a cruise July 23 to Aug. 10 around the Bering Sea, with the photographers Galen Rowell and Frans Lanting on board to conduct workshops (from $7,501); (800) 368-2794 or www.wildernesstravel.com. 

For Panda Lovers
 Many wildlife and conservation foundations offer their own tours. For instance, the World Wildlife Fund -- (888) 993-8687 or www .worldwildlife.org/travel -- and the San Diego Zoological Society -- (619) 231-1515 extension 4412, or at www.sandiegozoo.org/wildideas /worldwild -- both offer tours to panda country in China in May and June, among others. 
Those who want a more hands-on experience can volunteer through a number of agencies. Ecovolunteer (www.ecovolunteer.org) is a nonprofit Web-based collection of research or conservation projects seeking volunteers, who are asked to commit a minimum of one to four weeks and pay a fee, which largely supports conservation work. Lodging can be basic and the work menial. 
One of the best-known organizations fielding volunteers is Earthwatch; besides the Botswana crododile study, periodically through December ($2,195, excluding air fare), it sends groups to study endangered animals on almost every continent; (800) 776-0188 extension 188, and www.earthwatch.org.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey; 
Hundreds of Condos Are Rising at Vernon Ski Area

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN 

DATELINE: VERNON 

 BODY:
IF they build it ultragrand scale, or just grand -- it is clear that people will come.
 In November 2000, when pretty much all Mountain Creek Resort developers had to show at the ski area and theme park they had purchased here was improved ski lifts, an offering of 42 planned town house condos sold out within minutes. A proposed second-phase group of the luxury condos was instantly offered, and 18 more sold that day. Last July, another 25 were offered and sold in less than four hours. 
 The homes in the first phase were shown one day last month as "models" of the hundreds of additional units that are to be built. Buyers and prospective buyers swarmed to look inside -- and out, at stunning views of Hamburg Mountain where Danny Kass, who won an Olympic silver medal last month in the halfpipe, learned to snowboard.
"It's really a phenomenon," said Doug Ganssle, director of sales and marketing for Mountain Creek, whose owners also operate Stratton in Vermont and Whistler in British Columbia. "Vacation home sales elsewhere may be hurting because of the recession, but we've got a very hot property."
Too hot, say environmental groups, including the Sierra Club, that went to court, winning a decision last July that required the Intrawest Corporation to scale back its original design for a $500 million, 1,600-unit, four-season resort village on 2,200 acres. Intrawest's master plan envisioned three discrete neighborhoods above and below Route 94, which will become "Main Street" in the village after a bypass is constructed. Now, Intrawest plans to proceed with only two neighborhoods and 800 to 1,100 condos, clustered seven to a two-story building.
The top of Hamburg Mountain, where Intrawest had proposed to build 859 secluded homes and an 18-hole golf course, will remain undeveloped. Intrawest is negotiating to sell the state 400 acres of the mountaintop land for about $7.5 million and donate 1,400 more acres for the state's Green Acres conservation program. 
The state already owned the mountaintop once. Hamburg Mountain, the highest vertical rise in the state, is a former wildlife management area. It is part of the Highlands, a 50,000-acre wilderness region that serves as the watershed for drinking water in northern New Jersey. 
In 1986, the state sold the mountain to Great American Recreation Inc., which was already operating the Vernon Valley/Great Gorge ski area and theme park there. The state laid down a stipulation that the land "may only be used for parks, natural areas, forests, camping, fishing, water reserves, wildlife, reservoirs, hunting, boating, winter sports and similar uses." Conservationists objected to the deal, even with the deed restrictions, and over the years fought various development proposals.
Meanwhile, town officials were thrilled when Intrawest, a Canadian company, moved to acquire Vernon Valley/Great Gorge. By 1998, the equipment at the ski area was outmoded, the water park wave pool was decrepit and the owners were bankrupt. Intrawest purchased the property and began an immediate overhaul -- installing new top-of-the-line Doppelmayr chairlifts and a gondola. It also set its resort village architects to work.
"This is what Intrawest is known for," said Donald M. Ross, who heads Mountain Creek development for the company. "Our people respect local tradition, and they have a reverence for nature, always geared toward a celebration of the mountain. Every detail -- even the pattern on a lampshade, and the view from the easy chair beside the fireplace at sunset -- is important." 
The new homes at Mountain Creek are indeed carefully designed and appointed. Each of the one-, two-, and three-bedroom condos has luxurious touches, like tile all around the Jacuzzi or bathtub, handsome Adirondack-style furnishings, a snowflake or fish or bear motif on lampshades and tile, an open deck, full Internet service and a ski storage locker outside.
VERNON'S officials embraced the company, moving swiftly to grant approval for the master plan. It even rewrote zoning ordinances to permit the golf course on the mountain after environmentalists filed suit. Vernon's mayor announced he was "ecstatic" at the caliber of the developer. Mr. Ross, who was the Vernon town attorney before joining Intrawest, voted with his feet.
The company is based in Vancouver, British Columbia, and developed the Whistler Blackcomb mountain resort village there, which is consistently rated as one of the best in North America. Its other resorts include Mont Tremblant, Quebec; Stratton, Vt., and Mammoth, Calif. Intrawest has approvals of master plans for new resort villages at Squaw Valley, Calif.; Keystone, Colo.; and Mont Blanc in the Savoie region of the French Alps.
"I do get annoyed when people claim to know more or care more than we do," Mr. Ross said when asked about what he called the two "nuisance lawsuits" that still have not been settled. The Vernon Civic Association and the New Jersey Conservation Association both continue to seek to halt any further development, one by contesting the Vernon Township Board's procedures and the other by disputing whether a golf course is allowed under the deed restrictions.
But Intrawest still plans to soar in Vernon, even with its wings trimmed. This is a densely populated market -- Mountain Creek is 47 miles from New York City -- and Intrawest is set on mining it. 
It will build the Main Street filled with shops, cafes, restaurants, galleries, spas, plazas, hotels and lodges, as planned, Mr. Ross said. Ground is to be broken at the base of the mountain this spring for the Appalachian Lodge, a 105-unit hotel and condo, with shopping, restaurants, conference facilities and undergound parking.
"We remain committed to golf," Mr. Ross said, noting that buyers who have already paid $220,000 to upward of $300,000 for their Mountain Creek homes were promised a golf course. Designers are settling on an alternative site for the course, which is to have signature holes featuring the existing wilderness trails and Mountain Creek.
The company has not pulled back on anything but the mountaintop, it maintains. It certainly has not stinted on public relations hyperbole. In its promotional brochure and video, it promotes the planned village as "like a Rockwell painting on steroids."
Intrawest has picked up on the burgeoning popularity of Danny Kass and his fast-growing sport and made the 350-foot-long halfpipe at Mountain Creek into a snowboarding cultural icon. Mr. Kass and gold medal winner Ross Powers appeared last Sunday at Mountain Creek in a Specialty Sports Pro/Am Halfpipe competition.
"The hero is coming home," Mr. Ross chuckled before the competition. "We think a lot of people will be calling Mountain Creek home."

HEADLINE: LONG ISLAND VINES; 
A Lesson in Prices

BYLINE:  By HOWARD G. GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
Bracket creep in prices of Long Island's premier wines is an upfront issue. This column addressed it on Feb. 24, finding Macari's well-made 1998 Bergen Road, a red Bordeaux-style blend that costs $36, overpriced.
 Charles Massoud, an owner of Paumanok Vineyards in Aquebogue, replied in a thoughtful letter. 
 "We do have a few expensive wines, but the Long Island average price is quite acceptable," said Mr. Massoud, a former president of the Long Island Wine Council, the producers' trade association. "There are many wines that sell around or even below $10. These account for the larger quantity produced and sold. We like to feature our best wines and price them up to help recover our costs, and that is a risk we take.
"Is the concept 'the new kid on the block must first prove himself before raising his price' applicable in areas other than wine?" Mr. Massoud continued. "I do not think so. In wine production, there have been numerous instances of newer operations producing so-called cult wines selling for $100 and even several times that amount upon release, and yet they sold out and have a waiting list."
Going on, Mr. Massoud said: "If some of our prices are high, that should be an obstacle to selling our wines. Yet consumers, who are quite discriminating, do not seem to think so, since most of us are selling everything we are producing.
"Wine making is costly on Long Island, and taxes are quite high, exceeded maybe only by better-known places like Napa," he continued. "We are all small wineries and do not benefit from economies of scale, as many do in Napa.
"We have to import our bottles, whereas in California they manufacture them locally. We have a shortage of labor, whereas California has an abundance of trained, affordable migrant labor. I cannot think of any facet of the Long Island wine business where our costs are lower than anywhere else. The only advantage that we have is our presence in maybe the most sophisticated and demanding market in the world. So if our cost is high, it is going to affect the price."

HEADLINE: Nassau Ends Contract With Arts Group 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA DELATINER 

DATELINE: EAST NORWICH 

 BODY:
IN a move that the Suozzi administration says will save money and expand the scope of cultural programming the county supports, Nassau County will not renew its contract with the Long Island Partnership for Cultural Development, a nonprofit private group that runs arts programs with county money. The county's Recreation and Parks Department, led by its new commissioner, Doreen Banks, will take over those functions now.
 The partnership began to get county money in 2000, after the administration of the former county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, eliminated financing for the county's Office of Cultural Development, which had previously run county arts programs. 
 In its heyday, the office was one of the most lavishly financed county cultural agencies in the state, with a budget that reached $2.5 million in 1989. It sponsored performances by the New York Philharmonic and the Metropolitan Opera in Eisenhower Park. It also heavily supported Long Island groups like the American Chamber Ensemble and the Long Island Philharmonic, and the Sea Cliff Chamber Players and the National Grand Opera, which no longer exist. 
The agency's last budget, in 1999, was $860,000, said Jerome Seckler, its last director, who moved on to work at the partnership. He added that by then, little of that went directly to local groups.
Under the partnership's contract with the county, it has received $294,000 a year from Nassau's share of a state hotel tax. With that money, it has run programs at Chelsea Center here, which was the headquarters of the cultural development office; produced a guide to cultural activities in the county twice a year; and staged a summer festival at Eisenhower Park that includes performances by ethnic cultural groups. The partnership raised money privately and sold advertisements in the guide to make up the rest of its over $400,000 budget.
In Suffolk County, arts financing comes from the county's Office of Economic Development, and has never approached the sums distributed in Nassau. This year, the amount allocated is just under $431,500, from the state hotel tax and county general funds.
The move to bring the partnership's activities under control of the parks department will cut costs, said Bruce Nyman, director of communications for Thomas R. Suozzi, the county executive.
"It is the first of what will probably be hundreds of ways to save money," he said. "We should be able to save one-half of the contract."
Ms. Banks said that the parks department has always provided Chelsea Center with custodial services and maintenance, and that until recently its employees did secretarial work at the center.
Ms. Banks criticized the partnership for its programming at Chelsea Center, saying it had focused almost exclusively on the visual arts.
"We should be thinking in terms of a broader spectrum of the arts," she said. "Bring in theater, dance, poetry and make what is offered more answerable to the taxpayers."
Mr. Seckler said the partnership "was committed to improving the quality of life in Nassau County and we are doing that through our programming." In addition to art shows, he said, there have been concerts at Chelsea Center, along with the Eisenhower Park festival.
He added that the partnership would not disband, but would look for other space to continue to provide arts programs for the county.
Ms. Banks said she would form a committee to help her department schedule events at Chelsea Center and Eisenhower Park. Groups that co-sponsor performances by ethnic cultural groups in the park have been asked to contribute $10,000 each to help defray the cost of repairing the park's Chapin Theater.
Ms. Banks added she hoped to find a company to produce the guide, which is distributed to every household in the county, without charge. Barring that, Ms. Banks said, the county plans to ask the Long Island Visitors and Convention Bureau to get involved.
Mr. Seckler said the partnership was considering filing a lawsuit because the county had asked it to vacate Chelsea House before a 90-day grace period that he and Ms. Banks agreed was in the contract. He said his group needed the 90 days to make plans to continue to "try to provide the services to the public that it has promised, but at other facilities."
Ms. Banks said, "I don't think it's prudent to allow someone who doesn't belong there to stay in a county facility."

HEADLINE: Another Fine Mess 

BYLINE:  By JEFF HOLTZ 

 BODY:
BY now, everybody knows. Much of Interstate 95 is a mess and no one is quite sure how to fix it. But one thing is clear, the gridlock that is called rush hour is not only maddening to the drivers caught in it, but is harming the state economically by retarding growth.
 The question, as always, is what to do about it and, as always, the answers aren't easy. Mass transit is an option, making the road bigger is another, as are closing some exit and entrance ramps and using breakdown lanes during rush hours. Every solution has problems of its own. 
 But the state is making some progress. The State Department of Transportation said its annual Southwest Corridor Report, released in February, found the agency below its target of reducing commuter traffic on Interstate 95, the Merritt Parkway and Route 1 by 5 percent by 2003, a goal mandated by the General Assembly in 1997. But while the report indicated the agency had fallen about 700 vehicles short of its aim through 2001, officials remain positive about their plan. 
"It's really not that much of a negative. We still have had 5,987 documented trip diversions , which is still pretty good," Michael A. Sanders, the department's transit and ride sharing administrator, said about the number of drivers who have found other ways to get to work.
The department has implemented a range of strategies to entice drivers to abandon their cars and take mass transit: building a multilevel parking garage near the Bridgeport train station, lowering the train fare between Bridgeport and Stamford, setting up an intrastate train that combines the Shoreline East and Metro-North lines, providing shuttles from train stations to employers, organizing a bus line that links transit districts from Norwalk to Milford, working with nonprofit groups that organize ride sharing, instituting a telecommuting program and putting together a transportation marketing group. However, the department said that only 4 percent of the commuter trips in the state are made with mass transit.
Problems aren't confined to I-95. State officials and lawmakers said the under use of mass transportation, outdated roads that can't handle high traffic volume and increased development have also made Interstate 84 through Danbury and Waterbury, the I-84 and Interstate 91 interchange in Hartford and Route 8 through the Naugatuck Valley high-profile areas affected by major traffic delays. But they agreed the I-95 corridor, carrying a significant percentage of a Stamford work force that cannot afford the cost of living in lower Fairfield County, presents the greatest challenge to commerce and the environment.
The Connecticut Strategic Economic Framework, a 1999 study by the Charlotte, N.C.-based Michael Gallis and Associates, a company that examines urban development strategies, concluded that traffic congestion on the I-95 corridor is a major barrier to getting goods into the region.
"The primary growth of the New York region is now taking place in New Jersey," said Michael A. Gallis. "And essentially, I-95 and access into New England is becoming much more congested, which is raising not only issues of the commute to work, but also the cost of moving freight into New England, which is driving up the cost of living."
Economists said the problem has cost the state at least tens of millions of dollars. Stanley McMillen, manager of research for the Connecticut Center of Economic Analysis at the University of Connecticut, said the additional time it takes workers and freight to move through the state has escalated, among other things, environmental, fuel, insurance and medical costs for companies, slowing the state's rate of economic growth.
"As firms look at these costs -- that either deter, slow down or reverse their expansion -- they either don't come here, they expand somewhere else, or they don't expand and stay small. And that retards growth -- growth of new firms and existing firms," he said.
According to the transportation department, the Connecticut portion of I-95, opened in 1958 to accommodate as many as 70,000 vehicles a day, now carries as many as 150,000, which is expected to climb to 189,000 by 2020.
The Merritt Parkway, built in the 1930's, handles as many as 78,000 vehicles a day and is expected to reach 92,000 by 2020. Its inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places makes widening it from two lanes virtually impossible.
The D.O.T. has been making what it said are improvements to the design of those roads, especially I-95, where it is making three lanes with a full shoulder on each side the standard, and by adding a fourth lane in areas such as Bridgeport, Stamford and Norwalk, with heavy on-and-off volume and exits close together. Still, many commuters are frustrated.
"It's horrible," said Teri Petrazzuoli of East Haven, who was making a stop for gas at the Fairfield rest area on I-95 on the way to her accounting job in Darien. "It takes me about an hour and a half to get to work every day, and back, and most of the traffic is in Fairfield County. There have been some days where it has taken me three hours to get to work, when if I come on a Sunday it would take 45 minutes."
Ultimately, the fate of the state's traffic could rest with the Transportation Strategy Board. Established by the State Legislature last year, the 15-member board of state commissioners, transportation experts and business leaders will issue its complete report to the governor and the General Assembly in December on, among other things, rail, bus and high-speed ferry service; container barges on Long Island Sound to reduce truck traffic; bringing back tolls; using breakdown lanes during rush hours, and closing specific entrances and exits.
"One of the problems with the whole traffic issue is that it is very political," said Dean C. Pagani, a spokesmen for Gov. John G. Rowland. "Almost every suggestion that is made meets some opposition, whether it be closing entrance ramps to the highway, using breakdown lanes, building parking garages for train stations. Once you make the proposal, there is local opposition. So it is very hard to get anything done."
Early indications are that will be the case with the ramps. Last year Tom Casey, a Milford businessman, accompanied by other local business leaders and city officials, testified before the Legislature's Transportation Committee against closing the entrance at Exit 35 on I-95 because its potential effects on area businesses and neighborhoods. 
Bruce Fogwell of Greenwich, representing nearly 100 of that town's residents, testified in favor of closing Exit 4 on 1-95 because of what they see as heavy traffic on residential roads.
When you close entrance ramps, "you have be practical enough to understand what the impact is elsewhere," said State Representative Jacqueline M. Cocco, a Democrat from Fairfield, who is also the House chairwoman of the Transportation Committee. "If you close off a ramp onto 95, then you are saying that all that traffic remains on a local street. You have to ascertain, initially, what that does to a local street. And what I would suggest is that we do this sort of thing in a study, and then make a final decision, once we know exactly what we're doing on both sides of the road, and to everyone concerned."
Mr. Pagani said bringing back the tolls is "nothing the governor supports" because it is an additional tax, and said the idea "doesn't seem to have much legislative support." And Ms. Cocco said that after hearing from public safety officials, she does not support the governor's idea to use breakdown lanes as travel lanes during rush hour.
Officials said increasing rail service also has obstacles like the cost of train cars; local resistance to more stations and parking garages, and battles over the locations of new stations, such as the one taking place between Orange and West Haven.
The Strategy Board will also be looking at costs and funding, which will take on greater importance with the state now facing a budget deficit. In 2001, a $50 million allotment of the surplus earmarked for transportation wound up spent elsewhere, Mr. Pagani said.
"The first thing the governor wants to know is what we're spending money on," said Mr. Pagani. "Because of the state's budget deficit, most of that money has now been used to pay for ongoing expenses, or will be used for that purpose. One of the reasons he supported the Transportation Strategy Board, and the Legislature did, was we need to have a plan first. We can't just go around building roads and bridges and throwing money at train subsidies and so forth. We should figure out first what's going to work."

Yonkers Waterfront Projects Move Ahead

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
DOUBTERS -- and there have been many over the years when it comes to Yonkers's plans for its waterfront -- have only to visit the city's 4.5-mile strip of land along the Hudson River to be convinced that changes are finally taking place. After more than four decades of promises and plans that went no further than the drawing board, new construction is occurring on the once-decaying industrial site. 
 The first phase of the city's efforts, which is expected to cost more than $200 million in public and private investment, is focused on a 10-acre site along a half-mile stretch of the river that is bounded on the south by the Refined Sugars plant, on the east by the Metro-North Hudson Line and on the north by the Beczak Environmental Center. 
 The centerpiece of the project, which is the largest such redevelopment effort on the river north of New York City, is the $60 million Hudson Park, a 266-apartment rental building. It is being built by Collins Enterprises, which is based in Stamford, Conn., and specializes in downtown development projects. Work on the foundation for Hudson Park began this winter, with tenants expected to occupy apartments next year. Collins is the first residential developer to break ground in downtown Yonkers in 30 years. 
Metro-North Railroad, meanwhile, has begun a $35 million renovation of its historic Beaux-Arts station house and rail platform next to the Collins site. The modernization of the Getty Square Station, 28 minutes by train from Grand Central Station, is to be completed within three years.
Construction is already nearly complete at the $13 million Esplanade Park, a 1.5-mile-long promenade on the waterfront with unobstructed views along the opposite shoreline of the Palisades at their highest point. On the Westchester side of the river, the site, where the Hudson River School painter Jasper Cropsey painted the spectacular stone cliffs during the 19th century, had become littered with garbage and vacant buildings in recent decades. The new esplanade -- designed by Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn, the firm that produced the master plan for Battery Park City and the design guidelines for Baltimore's Inner Harbor East complex -- will be open to the public in June and include a band shell for concerts.
Following are other waterfront-related developments that are not directly on the 10 acres but contiguous to them and that are considered part of the project:
*A $10 million six-story parking garage for 600 cars is being constructed with city, state and federal funds on the east side of Main Street. It is to be ready by year-end.
*A new 200,000-square-foot, $53 million library building, which will also house the city's Board of Education, is being built at Dock and River Streets, integrating the former site of Otis Elevator. The structure is being built by the nonprofit Manhattan-based National Development Council and is financed with bonds from the city's Industrial Development Agency. It is to open in the spring.
*The 20,000-square-foot former home of The Gazette Press is being renovated at a cost of $4.5 million, most of which is being provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The building is to open later this year with a restaurant and several businesses as tenants.
*A new $8 million 70,000-square-foot corporate headquarters for Homes for America, a redevelopment company headquartered in Yonkers, will be constructed across from the train station at the foot of Main Street.
"People are building in our city for the first time in decades," Mayor John D. Spencer said proudly at a groundbreaking for the Collins project earlier this winter. In the fourth-largest city in the state, a protracted federal school and housing desegregation case that began in the 1970's drained the municipal coffers. In 1979 a proposed 1,850-unit condominium project in an existing building to be called Pierpointe on the Hudson was considered a potential savior of the downtown, but it fell victim to a construction moratorium imposed on the city in 1987 during its fight against a housing desegregation order.
IN 1988, the city converted an existing power plant into a 136-unit condominium called the Scrimshaw House. At first, it was slow to fill up, but it is now fully occupied -- although it has stood alone on the undeveloped waterfront until last fall, when work began on the Collins project.
"Before, we were pursuing the developers; now they're pursuing us," said Jim Pinto, director of the office of downtown and waterfront development.
Mr. Pinto said that under the city's master plan, there are three other parcels that have yet to be developed in the first phase of waterfront construction. A second phase will include about 25 acres north of the environmental center and west of the rail line.
For the first phase, in addition to building 266 apartments in two buildings, Collins Enterprises has allotted 20,000 square feet for retail and office space and restaurants. 
Apartments in the buildings, which will vary from two to nine stories, will range from 650 square feet to 1,350 square feet. Rents are to start at $1,800 a month for a one-bedroom apartment and reach $2,900 a month for the largest apartment, which will have two bedrooms and a den.
Arthur Collins II, president of Collins Enterprises, said his company was marketing the apartments to singles, empty-nesters and young professionals working in Manhattan. He predicted that many of the tenants would be what he called "transient professionals," who are in the New York area on assignment and renting for only one or two years. "They could be graduate students at Columbia University, musicians working in Manhattan or employees of foreign banks," he said. 
Hudson Park will offer tenants such amenities as community rooms, a health club and a small pool or spa.
Collins Enterprises and its equity partner, Simpson Housing L.P. of Denver, put up 25 percent of the cost of the project. The lender is Key Bank, which has given the two partners a $75 million mortgage on the property.
Under an agreement with the city's Industrial Development Agency, Collins pays taxes on the project, but for the first 15 years it will receive either full or partial refunds from the state.
Collins Enterprises specializes in redeveloping urban areas and what Mr. Collins called "first-ring suburbs close to employment centers." The company said it enters into joint ventures with equity partners and coordinates all aspects of the development process. It often stays involved as the asset manager after a project is completed.
Collins is the developer for two waterfront developments in Norfolk, Va.: the Heritage at Freemason Harbour, a $28 million, 280-rental project, and PierPointe at Freemason Harbour, a $30 million, 150-condominium project. 
Mr. Collins said he never becomes involved in a downtown project that is not part of a larger redevelopment effort. For example, he said, in Yonkers the renovation of the landmark Metro-North Station in adjacent Getty Square is critical to the construction of the apartment units and businesses.
The train station, which was designed in 1911 by Warren & Wetmore, the architects who collaborated on the design of Grand Central Terminal, is decorated with metal and wood carvings and chandeliers and was built to serve the businessmen, entertainers and philanthropists who were attracted some 90 years ago to Yonkers' palatial homes along the river.
The work on the brick and granite station building includes repair of its intricate terra-cotta cornice, oak benches, domed tiled ceiling and single remaining chandelier, said Marjorie Anders, a spokeswoman for Metro-North. Four missing chandeliers will be replicated and installed in their original locations, she said, and a historic clock will be replicated and installed above the ticket windows. The station work also includes installing a new roof and new glass-enclosed elevators that go from the ground floor inside the building to the train platform outside.
The design for the restoration is being performed by Consoer Townsend Envirodyne Engineers of New York. The project is financed in part by a $1.2 million state grant.
To link the station with the apartments and public areas on the waterfront, the station is being redesigned with a wide doorway and corridor that will open onto the esplanade at the rear of the station. 
The river will be the theme of a sculpture commissioned by the M.T.A. Arts for Transit program. A pair of sinuous aluminum sculptures by Yonkers artist Barbara Segal, each 9-feet-wide by 72-feet-long and visible from both the north- and south-bound sides of the platform, will be installed. The sculpture was inspired by the original name of the Hudson, Muhheakantuck, which means "the river that flows both ways," a reference to the tidal action of the lower part of the river. 
The first phase of the waterfront redevelopment is expected to create 700 or more jobs -- construction jobs initially and then positions in the stores, offices and restaurants -- said Edward A. Sheeran, executive director of the city's Industrial Development Agency and special assistant to Mayor Spencer. Within five years, the development is expected to generate an additional $6 million in sales tax revenue and $2.5 million in property taxes.
"What was previously an unfair perception of Yonkers is finally changing," Mr. Sheeran said. "There's been a ripple effect from the new development, and we're seeing businesses in Yonkers along North Broadway and in Getty Square now taking a lot of pride in the area. It's a very welcome change."

UNTIL last month, the commissioners of the Delaware River Port Authority generally got what amounted to a free ride from their bosses, the governors of New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
 "I think there was one small item vetoed once by Governor Whitman, but that was a peculiar case and was rectified by the next meeting," said Joseph Diemer, the spokesman for the authority, known as the D.R.P.A., which operates four bridges over the Delaware River in South Jersey, the Lindenwold High-Speed transit line and several development projects in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
 But then Governor McGreevey vetoed the entire set of minutes of the authority's meeting of Jan. 16. In a terse note to the commissioners, Mr. McGreevey said he took such a drastic step "because of my concerns as to whether the D.R.P.A. expenditures are the best means of benefiting the Camden/Philadelphia region." 
Jeffrey Nash, who was appointed a commissioner by Mr. McGreevey a little more than a week ago, acknowledged that the veto was more tactical than an expression of disdain for any particular project.
"He wants to slow everything down, to make sure everyone looks at everything more closely, and I agree," said Mr. Nash.
He added: "These are going to be tough financial times. We need to take a larger look at our community and its needs. To the extent that the D.R.P.A. can do good things here, I applaud the governor's move."
With concern mounting over the state's budget deficit, it was interesting that Mr. McGreevey picked a fight so early in his term with a bistate agency. Though the authority's current commissioners from New Jersey were largely appointed by former Gov. Christie Whitman, a spokesman for the new governor insisted that Mr. McGreevey's veto message was not a partisan statement.
"He wants to have a better understanding of the long-range planning for the Port Authority and believes this is the most prudent thing to do," said Paul Aronsohn, the governor's press secretary.
For years, the port authority primarily collected tolls from the transit line and the bridges -- including the Benjamin Franklin Bridge, the longest suspension bridge in the world when it was built in 1926 -- and made sure the trains and roadways were maintained. But in 1992, spurred primarily by State Senator Vincent Fumo, a powerful Democrat from Philadelphia, the commissioners started taking more seriously the authority's long-dormant charge to promote the Delaware River waterfront and projects that would help the economy in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
Currently, including work on the bridges and trains, the authority has $1.3 billion committed to projects that are either in the works or were recently completed. Some are small, with only seed money coming from the authority, like $395,000 it has supplied to create a brand-name for the Delaware River waterfront developments that would perhaps match the Inner Harbor name in Baltimore.
But there are also larger grants, like $26 million to build a tramway over the Delaware linking Philadelphia and Camden or $30 million for the demolition of blighted buildings along the Admiral Wilson Boulevard, which leads to the Benjamin Franklin Bridge on the New Jersey side and the development of a park.
But there has also been criticism about some of the expenditures, like $50 million the authority gave for the partial conversion of the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard to private enterprise. So far, the company, Kvaerner Inc., has not renovated one ship.
More recently, two other projects were sharply criticized. The authority spent $7 million for a floating sound-and-light show on the Delaware and a submarine simulation chamber for the New Jersey State Aquarium on the Camden side of the river. The contract for both of these projects ran into difficulty, and officials at the authority acknowledge that neither will probably reach fruition.
"These were, indeed, disasters, and it is unfortunate," said Mr. Nash.
Mr. Nash, the Democratic freeholder director of Camden County for the last seven years, will take over as vice chairman of the 16-member agency, replacing Glenn Paulsen, who was appointed by Mrs. Whitman.
"Though those projects took up a substantial amount of money, I don't want to indict everything the port authority has done," said Mr. Nash. "The Admiral Wilson Boulevard project was certainly a success, as was the construction of Campbells Field," he said, referring to $8.5 million the authority gave toward the total $23.5 million cost of the minor league baseball stadium on the waterfront.
But Mr. Nash said he and Mr. McGreevey were concerned that the commissioners had been approving projects without thinking through how each affected the other.
"I've been freeholder director here for quite a while, and I, for one, have never seen a master plan," said Mr. Nash. "I'm not going to go in with any agenda. But I do think there has to be a better idea of how everything goes together."
Mr. Paulsen, who will be stepping down as vice chairman of the authority, was obviously disturbed by the governor's decision to replace him. Indeed, he issued a three-page statement defending the authority's actions since he came to the board in 1995.
In the statement, he noted that while the board had substantially raised bridge tolls and train commuter fees, it had also improved the authority's bond ratings from junk status to investment grade. And he outlined ways the commissioners cut staff, professionalized services, instituted the E-ZPass system and invested money in development projects that have generated jobs.
"When our current commissioners came on the D.R.P.A. board in 1995, D.R.P.A.'s finances were in a crisis," said Mr. Paulsen, an attorney and the Burlington County Republican chairman, defending his tenure. "We made difficult decisions -- including cutting spending four years in a row -- and implementing the recommendations of an independent management audit."
While most of $185.7 million collected in bridge tolls and train fares come from New Jerseyans commuting to Philadelphia, more of the spending unrelated to the bridges goes into projects on the other side of the river. In addition to the $50 million for the Kvaerner shipyard, $14 million went toward the new stadiums being built in Philadelphia for the Eagles and the Phillies, $16 million for the development of Penn's Landing on the Philadelphia side of the river, $2.5 million for the expansion of the Pennsylvania Convention Center and $10.5 million for the National Constitution Center at Independence National Park in Philadelphia.
"But that is not the real issue," said Mr. Nash. "New Jersey people who pay tolls do get to benefit if good projects are done in Philadelphia. We want to see that there is generally a 50-50 split in funding for projects in each state."
As Mr. Nash and Mr. McGreevey see it, agencies like the authority have to be more accountable.
"The interplay between the state budget and the D.R.P.A., for instance, will come to play when we are doing the Camden revitalization program," said Mr. Nash. "The D.R.P.A. will have to be a full partner with the state there, and if it is not fiscally responsible, that vital project will fail."

Seeing Opportunity After the Shock

BYLINE:  By Rick Gladstone 

 BODY:
Cities that have just suffered calamities are not often viewed as attractive investments. But in an unusual twist in an annual ranking, the top three cities for investing in downtown office properties this year have been sites of disasters -- Houston, with the collapse of the Enron Corporation, is No. 1; and New York and Washington, with their devastation from the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, are second and third. 
 The rankings, by Integra Realty Resources, a commercial real estate appraisal firm, said Houston's downtown revitalization, which has attracted many oil and health care businesses, had given it a remarkably low vacancy rate, currently 7.4 percent, "notwithstanding the Enron implosion." Although the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing by Enron could place a large part of Houston's office space on the market, Integra said, other development projects could be delayed, keeping the city's downtown office vacancy rate low. 
 As for New York, with a downtown Manhattan office vacancy rate of 8 percent, and Washington, with 4.5 percent, Integra said that "because of major building losses and subsequent constrained office inventory, demand overshadows supply."
Nationally, Integra reported a downtown office vacancy rate of 10 percent, well above the 7.3 percent rate last year. 
The other cities on Integra's top 10 list for office property investment and their vacancy rates: Sacramento, 5 percent; Denver, 7.3 percent; Las Vegas, 8.2 percent; Atlanta, 10 percent; Charlotte, N.C., 5.1 percent; Orlando, Fla., 10.7 percent; and San Diego, 7.2 percent. Rick Gladstone

More Attention to Security in Designing Buildings

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
ARCHITECTS, engineers and property managers have been developing a wide variety of measures to protect the inhabitants of office buildings from terrorist attacks as a result of the events of Sept. 11. Some are already in effect, while others are still in the planning stages.
 Operators of existing properties have tightened controls over who and what comes into buildings and are limiting assess to designated areas within the structures. Designers of new buildings are thinking of more robust structures in anticipation of possible changes in building codes. 
 No one is planning structures that can withstand the crash of wide-body jetliners filled with fuel -- little short of a nuclear containment vessel can do that, experts say. But building designers are taking measures as simple as locating air intakes near the top of structures, to deter attempts to introduce poisonous gas or biological agents. 
"The fresh air intakes in many buildings are located at the ground floor, which never made much sense due to exhaust fumes," said Robert F. Fox, a partner in Fox & Fowle Architects, which designed the Conde Nast and Reuters buildings, which are also known as 4 Times Square and 3 Times Square. "Now they will be up high and with filters like we used at 4 Times Square that can take out 90 percent of the particulates."
The experts are also looking at places like Israel and London, which have long experience with terrorist bombings, for ways to "harden" buildings to minimize the impact of blasts. But the challenge in New York might be greater than in those locations, given the terrorist tactics used in the attack on the World Trade Center.
"The bombers in London really did not want to kill anybody, so they would call the police in advance to clear an area," said Ysrael A. Seinuk, chief executive of the Cantor Seinuk Group, a structural engineering consultant with offices in New York and London. "Now we are dealing with terrorists who not only want to kill, but are willing to die to do it."
Hardening involves taking such steps as encasing steel columns close to the ground in concrete, to make them more resistant to blast and fire, and designing in diagonal beams amid the vertical and horizontal structure to transfer loads if part of a building is damaged.
The new attention to potential disasters may also have an effect on the basic shapes of buildings, as designers seek to protect the vital core of the structure, which contains the elevators, stairwells and utility lines.
"We are probably going to see more buildings like the ones on Sixth Avenue and Park Avenue, with a broad bustle on the lower floors and a narrow tower," said Joseph Peters, a building security specialist with Cushman & Wakefield, the brokerage and management company. "The bustle protects the tower and the core," he said. "If there is an explosion, it blows out some storefronts, but not the core."
Proposals for more sweeping changes in design practices are also being heard, including a call for new national construction standards to make public and government buildings more resistant to terrorist attacks. Such changes, some experts say, could limit the height of high-rises and eliminate such designs as open atriums at the base of office buildings,
Last week representatives of the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the American Society of Civil Engineers testified before Congress, saying the nation needed to develop building codes that would resist the progressive collapse that felled the Twin Towers. "I believe it is imperative for the U.S. to learn from the worst-ever building disasters in human history and take aggressive remedial action to minimize future losses,' said Arden L. Bement Jr., the director of the institute of standards.
MR. SEINUK said that changes to harden buildings, like most things in construction, are cheapest when included at the design stage, rather than added on as afterthoughts. "When you have a building in the planning stages," he said, "the additional cost of hardening it does not add 2 percent to the cost."
He said the changes typically involve only the lower floors of a building, with the upper floors built in a conventional fashion.
Some other hardening tactics include adding extra steel reinforcing bars to concrete surfaces vulnerable to attack, so that even if the concrete is shattered by a blast, the broken chunks are held in place and do not fall downward causing additional damage, as happened in the federal building in Oklahoma City in 1995. Another is requiring that the display windows of stores be made of glass laminated like automotive windshields, which can break but does not shatter and form potentially lethal shards.
Since the effects of a blast dissipate greatly with distance, particularly if it is in the open, Mr. Seinuk said, designers may want to eliminate underground parking in confined spaces under buildings or limit them to employees likely to be in the building if a bomb explodes. Similarly, the areas around the loading docks can be hardened to limit the impact of a truck-borne explosive on the rest of the structure.
Although most buildings have evacuation plans, rushing people from a building into streets where they may be subject to further attack may not be the best approach, he said. "In Israel, every floor of a building has a well-protected concrete bunker where people can go and lock themselves in for safety," he said.
Future designs will also provide for multiple entrances into a building for electrical power, telecommunications and other utilities, so that damage to one part of it does not cut off these services to the entire structure. 
While planners of future projects are contemplating designs, operators of existing properties are intensifying security measures and making sure they are as visible as possible. In the past, according to a report by Larry Conlon, another security specialist with Cushman & Wakefield, security was "focused on protecting the building occupants from acts of random street crime, mitigating internal and external theft and the protection of the physical asset."
Since the aircraft attacks of Sept. 11 and the subsequent anthrax mailings, security specialists have to deal with the threats of a much greater magnitude. A building with barriers and obvious access controls is less likely to be attacked than one with a lax program, Mr. Conlon said. "Properties with visible security operations are less likely to be targets," he said."
Each property manager needs to do a threat assessment, based on the tenants in the building and the neighborhood. Having government agencies as tenants may increase the likelihood of an attack, as could the proximity to a high-profile landmark, Mr. Conlon wrote in his report. The building at 7 World Trade Center was not directly attacked, but burned and fell as a result of its location adjacent to the Twin Towers.
Regardless of specific threats, security advisers are pressing for increasing control of access to buildings, identification of tenants and visitors and control of the parts of a building to which people have access. Office building lobbies need to be equipped with prominent security desks and physical barriers to prevent people from getting into the building without being cleared by security personnel, they say. 
Some of this is already happening. "Turnstiles in lobbies are going to be as common as elevators in tall buildings," Mr. Fox said. "There are turnstiles at 4 Times Square and the Reuters building."
Operating efficiency may give way to increased security and flexibility. Central air-conditioning plants may be more economical to operate, but they are difficult to purge after a fire or other event contaminates the air in a building, said Frank Wilkinson, a senior project manager at Cushman & Wakefield. So the company is recommending that buildings be designed with separate air-conditioning units for each floor.
But sometimes the need to have flexibility to operate a building for a changing array of tenants may trump ultimate safety. Most security experts agree that a reinforced concrete core offers greater fire protection than one made of steel beams and wall board or unreinforced concrete blocks.
"A concrete core offers more fire resistance than steel, if only because the fireproofing spray on steel tends to fall off over time," Mr. Peters said. 
But as a building's tenants change, there may be a need to run ductwork through a core, which means cutting holes in concrete heavily reinforced with steel bars. "If you are operating a building over 15 to 20 years, you are going to make some openings in the core, and steel is a lot more flexible in that regard," he said.

HEADLINE: Mixing Development and a Working Port in Maine 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE

DATELINE: PORTLAND Me. 

 BODY:
A 100-room hotel under construction in the historic port district here is one of several major projects under way around the city's working waterfront, even as debate goes on about how to balance preservation of marine industrial uses with the desire for more development.
 In addition to the $13 million Portland Harbor Hotel, scheduled to open in June, other development under way, recently completed or planned around this Casco Bay harbor includes two office buildings, two fish processing plants, another hotel, a marine research center and an aquarium, as well as expansion of the city's industrial, fishing and passenger terminal facilities. Together, it is hoped that these improvements will help keep one of the nation's oldest working ports vibrant. 
 This diverse mix of uses, set among three- and four-story 19th-century brick buildings, continues to lure investors. "Portland is a great walking city with a perfect mix of old and new infrastructure to attract business and tourist travelers," said David P. Hart, chief executive of Hart Hotels Inc., based in Buffalo, which in a joint venture with Dictar Associates of Eliot, Me., is building the three-story Portland Harbor Hotel atop a existing 200-car garage on Fore Street. The hotel is expected to have room rates of $159 to $249 a night during the tourist season -- May through October. Dictar has long owned the 20,000-square-foot garage site and three other properties on that block, which on its Commercial Street side faces the harbor.
Since 1633, commerce in fish and fuel at the waterfront has been at the heart of Portland's economic life. As the city grew, its business district expanded a few miles northward and entrepreneurs branched out into new industries. But the waterfront, despite its cycles of growth and contraction, has remained at the core of the city's identity. Now, commercial marine activities -- fishing, petroleum and passenger trade -- generate about $750 million a year in revenues, up from about $400 million in 1993, city officials said. 
The downtown financial district, with about 4 million square feet of office space within walking distance of the harbor, has one of New England's healthiest commercial real estate markets. At the end of last year, the space available for lease or sublease in the district stood at only 1.8 percent while in the metropolitan region's entire 8.7 million square feet of office space, 4.6 percent was available, local brokers say.
Portland's availability rate is far rosier than the 18 percent registered in Boston last quarter, but vacancies in the Portland area have increased from 2.5 percent in January 2001. 
Of the 99,250 square feet of new offices in five buildings that came on the market in 2001, 84,859 square feet are vacant, according to Gregg Boulos, a partner at CB Richard Ellis/the Boulos Company, a local broker. Asking rents have slipped to about $18 a square foot annually, from a peak of $23 in December 2000. In the last year, landlords have also been offering tenants who lease space some free rent and more generous improvement budgets.
Among the factors in the Portland market's stability are its modest size, restraint on speculative projects and diverse tenant base, including financial services, banks, insurance, health care and professional services companies. "We weren't overly reliant on the dot-coms, so when they became dot-bombs, we didn't suffer too much," Mr. Boulos said. 
Mr. Boulos said he expected the office market availability rate to remain below 5 percent until the economy recovers. Once rents approach $30 a square foot, he said, some new office buildings will be built. 
With land costs ranging from about $150,000 an acre in the suburbs to about $1 million an acre in the financial district and rising toward the water, the waterfront area is the most costly to develop, said David H. Bateman, president of Dictar. 
Still, the water's allure is irresistible. In the summer of 2000, new projects started appearing there with the opening of a new 67,000-square-foot office building on Customs House Street, where Merrill Lynch now occupies the ground floor. In January 2001, the Blake Building, an 1860's warehouse on Commercial Street facing the water, was renovated for office and retail space and expanded by Olympia Equity Investors L.L.C., a joint venture partnership with Erin Management Group of Portland. Olympia can develop another 60,000 square feet on the site. 
It is seeking city approvals to build a 120-room hotel for about $16 million on a one-acre site that it purchased on the next block. By this June, it hopes to start construction on the hotel, the Hilton Garden Inn, which is to be managed by Erin Management, said Kevin P. Mahaney, chief executive of Erin and Olympia.
Later this month, the Gulf of Maine Aquarium, a private nonprofit institution, plans to complete a property swap with the United States Navy. By then, it will complete construction of a Naval Reserve training facility at the Navy base in Brunswick, which it will exchange for 5.5 acres of Navy property on the Portland waterfront. There, the aquarium plans to develop a $6 million research center and, eventually, a $42 million aquarium, using funds from private and state and federal government sources, explained Donald W. Perkins, president of the aquarium.
"Next fall, we'll break ground on the lab that fishermen and scientists will use for research into fishery ecosystems, marine bioscience and for public education," he said.
Discussions about the waterfront's future have taken more immediacy since last fall, when the Bath Iron Works vacated about 12 acres of land it had leased for 20 years from the city in the eastern section of the 200-acre waterfront. Current zoning for the six miles of waterfront allow for only marine industrial use, although offices are allowed on the upper floors of some buildings. 
The city's port department has proposed a master plan in which the western section of the waterfront would remain industrial. The central section, the port agency said, would still be a mix of maritime and nonmaritime uses such as offices on the upper floors. The eastern section might undergo zoning changes to support some retail space, pedestrian walkways and terminals for the growing passenger trade, which carried 210,000 international passengers to Canadian cities and 43,100 people to United States destinations last year. That compares with 163,000 international passengers in 1998 and 8,100 domestic passengers in 1995, the most recent figures available, said Capt. Jeffrey W. Monroe, the port director.
By midyear, Captain Monroe said, the City Council is likely to approve a plan for the upgrade to the eastern section of the waterfront, which is expected to cost $16.5 million. Construction will be financed through a bond issue, which has already passed. Captain Monroe said he hoped that in the next few years, construction on about $30 million in new terminals, roads, cargo and fuel storage facilities can get under way on the other side of the waterfront.
Under an existing tax-increment financing program, funds for upgrading some waterfront buildings, piers and other facilities are to be raised by channeling part of the property taxes paid on new construction or improvements of existing property in the waterfront area. Even developers and their associates, however, disagree on the wisdom of diverting city revenues during a recession and of barring much commercial real estate development on valuable waterfront property.
"This will be an economic battleground for the next few years because the working waterfront can't pay for itself," said Mark A. Malone, a commercial broker. He said that while he did not want the mixed nature of the waterfront to be changed, "there could be more commercial development."
But Mr. Mahaney of Olympia Equity Investors said: "There's plenty of room to develop on the land side before we encroach on the working waterfront. Our market still has more space than users."

HEADLINE: Attention, Shoppers 

BYLINE:  By CAREN CHESLER 

DATELINE: PARAMUS 

 BODY:
IT is Saturday afternoon in Bergen County, and the traffic on Route 17 in Paramus is backed up for miles as people head to one of the borough's four sprawling shopping malls. The parking lot at Garden State Plaza, the granddaddy of them all, is already filling up, and a line of cars is snaking through the aisles, searching for that rare empty space.
 Inside the mall, a shoe store that is going out of business is packed with young women shouting out sizes to a lone salesgirl. Lines at most of the stalls in the food court are 10 deep. Nearly all the benches around the mall are occupied but for one, where someone has left an uneaten piece of pretzel. 
 Yet in Teaneck, a mile away, the shopping district is as quiet as Christmas morning. Like many downtown areas that saw their customers flock to the malls, the Cedar Lane business district was left with an odd array of mom-and-pop shops that do not see much pedestrian traffic. Among them is a hat shop, a pet store, a lingerie shop, a dusty camera store and a disproportionate number of nail and hair salons, which appear as frequently as black keys on a piano. 
Shoppers won't find a Gap store here. On the other hand, parking in the municipal lots is not a problem.
Teaneck's business manager, Meryl Layton, says the business district is withering because of Bergen County's antiquated blue laws, which prohibit most shops that sell clothing, furniture, building supplies, home furnishings and appliances from opening on Sundays. And as long as the blue laws are in effect, Ms. Layton says, she will not be able to persuade stores like the Gap or Ann Taylor to open there.
"It's not as if people are sitting around the fireplace, participating in family activities," said Ms. Layton. "They're getting into their cars and shopping. They're just not shopping in Bergen County."
For that reason, she has vowed to join forces with the local chamber of commerce to overturn what she views as archaic laws that are a vestige of the country's puritan past. The blue laws were first enacted in New Jersey in 1854 but were later repealed. The Legislature then enacted a new statute in 1959, which counties could adopt by referendum. Every one -- with the exception of Bergen -- has since repealed that it.
In this day and age, blue laws in most parts of the country have been wiped from the books as quickly as malls have sprouted up. Yet Bergen County -- affluent, densely populated and a stone's throw from New York and home to just about every major retailer in the Northeast -- has steadfastly chosen to keep the doors shut on Sunday.
One reason, many residents agree, is the number of cars that flood the malls and clog the roads. Sunday is the one day a week when residents of Paramus say they get their roads back.
For his part, Mayor Cliff Gennarelli of Paramus, who strongly supports the ban on Sunday shopping, is preparing to do battle with Ms. Layton and others who would like to see the stores open.
But those opposed to opening stores in Paramus on Sunday are only one strand in the dizzying web of interests that threaten to weigh in on the debate.
The large retailers in the Paramus malls say they want the blue laws repealed because sales figures would be an average of 20 percent to 25 percent higher if they could open on Sunday. However, some of the large mall owners want to retain the laws because they are convinced that officials in Paramus will retain the local ordinance banning Sunday sales. If malls in the rest of the county can open, they reason, their malls will be put at a competitive disadvantage.
Then there are the Orthodox Jewish merchants -- who Ms. Layton says own half of the shops on Cedar Lane -- who also want to see the blue laws repealed because their stores are already closed on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. Yet the churches in the county would prefer to keep Sunday, their Sabbath, as a day of rest.
And the merchants who are most ambivalent are the owners of the mom-and-pop stores in Teaneck, many of whom like having Sundays off. As a result, Ms. Layton says stores like Williams-Sonoma and Starbucks are unlikely to open there any time soon.
"The town is certainly affluent enough," she said. "It just isn't open for business enough."
Ms. Layton and several local chambers of commerce have asked Assemblywoman Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat from Bergen County, to sponsor legislation that would enable municipalities to choose for themselves whether they want the blue laws to remain in effect. Ms. Weinberg has agreed, and she says she is drafting such legislation.
To be sure, several downtown business districts in Bergen County have attracted upscale stores despite the blue laws. Ridgewood, for instance, has a flourishing downtown, with such chains represented as Laura Ashley, Talbot's and Williams-Sonoma. Englewood has a Victoria's Secret and an Ann Taylor, Fort Lee a Benetton. 
"They've all accepted the fact that they can't open on Sunday, and they're still here," said Angela Cautillo, executive director of the Ridgewood Chamber of Commerce, though acknowledging that Ridgewood was one of the wealthiest town's in the county, on par with Summit and Westfield.
Nor is this the first effort to roll back the blue laws in Bergen County. In referendums in 1980 and 1993 residents voted by a ratio of 2 to 1 to retain the laws.
But this time may be different. While the residents of Paramus as well as the county's Republican legislators in Trenton have opposed past efforts to overturn the law, Ms. Weinberg, a Democrat, might get more traction on the issue this time around.
"Loretta has a stronger position there than she's ever had," Ms. Layton said. "And certainly the Democrats are stronger than they've been in a long time."
A grass-roots effort to roll back the blue laws is already taking hold. Local governments in Teaneck, Fort Lee and Rutherford have passed resolutions asking the state to allow them to opt out of the county's blue laws, and officials in Englewood, Fair Lawn and Ridgewood say they may follow suit.
Still, Mayor Gennarelli of Paramus, who prevailed in 1993 in retaining the blue laws, says he is not deterred.
"We're going to raise a very large amount of money, and we are going to fight this movement with every resource available," he said.
Like Ms. Layton, he too has initiated a grass-roots effort to gain support, and he says he is in the process of talking to business owners and officials in towns that want to maintain the status quo.

'All Roads Lead to Paramus'
As for himself, Mayor Gennarelli owns a store in the Willowbrook Mall, in neighboring Passaic County, and is open for business on Sunday. He also owns two Dunkin' Donuts franchises in Bergen County, but food establishments can remain open all week.
Still, Mr. Gennarelli insists that residents need a respite from the traffic they have to contend with six days a week. Each day, he said, about 285,000 cars pass through the intersection of Routes 4 and 17, making it the busiest crossroad in the state; on Saturdays, it can take 40 minutes to get across Paramus, which is only 6.7 miles wide, while on Sunday it can take 4 minutes.
"All roads lead to Paramus," he said. "That's why everyone builds here. But people here need a day of rest, a day to spend time with their family, or reading a book or going to the park or doing nothing. The only day that can happen in this county is the one when the stores are closed."
In truth, Paramus has the most restrictive blue laws in Bergen County. For example, residents cannot have contractors do work on their homes; some homeowners have even been prosecuted for violating the ordinance. When the state transportation department agreed to upgrade the interchange of Routes 4 and 17 two years ago, Paramus officials forbade the crews from working on Sundays, though the officials finally relented after being assured the work would be done ahead of schedule.
Last year, borough officials prohibited Toys "R" Us, whose headquarters are in Paramus, from running a computerized inventory system for its nationwide chain on Sundays because they said it violated the blue laws. Next year, Toys "R" Us plans to move its headquarters to Wayne, in Passaic County. Carol Fuller, a spokeswoman for Toys "R" Us, said the move was a way to consolidate its four offices around the state, although others close to the situation claimed it was because of the blue laws.
"Those fighting the Sunday closing laws say they are not asking for a countywide repeal," said Ms. Weinberg. "They simply want those towns that want to opt out to have the ability to do so. A petition would first have to be circulated, and if enough signatures were obtained, a referendum would be held. If Paramus residents want to keep their blue laws, they can."
Ms. Weinberg, whose district includes Teaneck, said Paramus had for too long been forcing its will on the rest of the county when it came to the issue of blue laws.

Traffic, but No Tax Benefits
She noted that officials in Paramus had made their own decision to open their highways to retail stores, and had been enjoying the property tax benefits ever since. Teaneck, which is less than a mile from Paramus on Route 4, has never shared in those tax benefits yet it has been forced to share in the traffic, Ms. Weinberg added, noting that towns like Teaneck want to revitalize their downtown areas and need to be able to compete with the malls.
"Paramus chose to put department stores every five feet," she said. "For places like Teaneck and Rutherford, who are doing improvement districts, this would be a boon to them. It will help bring shoppers in."
Mayor Gennarelli is not buying.
To his way of thinking, the large retailers in the malls have tried in vain to fight the blue laws and now they are taking the issue out of the hands of county residents and placing it in those of the politicians.
"What you've got here are politicians and big business showing their greedy fangs again," Mr. Gennarelli said, "trying to suck the blood out of the people who live here."
But Melanie Willoughby, president of the New Jersey Retail Merchants Association, says it is the downtown business districts, not the mall stores, who are behind this latest movement to roll back the blue laws.
Ms. Willoughby said that while all stores suffered during the latest economic downturn, the large retailers were better equipped to weather it.
"The big mall stores had their chance back in 1993, and they spent a lot of money, and they said enough is enough," she said.
Staying closed on Sundays can come at a steep cost. Jay Weingast, who has owned an Athlete's Foot store in Garden State Plaza for eight years, says the county's blue laws cost him from $200,000 to $300,000 a year.
"In the months of November and December and back-to-school time, we lose so much," Mr. Weingast said.
For a company like the Gap -- which also owns Banana Republic and Old Navy and had sales of $13.8 billion last year -- its annual losses from the blue laws represent a much smaller percentage.
Large retailers say they do enough business in Paramus to have stores there despite the blue laws.
"Because of its location, the choice was made to go ahead and open there, even though they're not open on Sunday," said Ann Dinkley, director of public relations for Borders, which has two of its bookstores in Bergen County.
Yet those who favor repealing the laws face an unlikely opponent: the owners of the large malls in Paramus, who don't want to be placed at a competitive disadvantage.
Allan Cooperman, a North Jersey developer and part owner of the Riverside Square Mall in Hackensack, said he was watching the latest debate unfold with great interest, though he said he did not want to involve himself for fear of antagonizing the opposition -- both mall owners and county residents.
"It's a very difficult political issue in this county," Mr. Cooperman said. "We're just hoping it gets repealed, and we're encouraging the mayors of each town to do what they can."
David Laband, who wrote "Blue Laws: The History, Economics and Politics of Sunday-Closing Laws" (Lexington Books, 1987), said such laws always had protectionist undertones, and were often found in places with a large number of mom-and-pop shops.
"Blue laws exist to protect certain categories of firms from economic competition," Mr. Laband said. "By forcing the big chain stores to stay closed, the small mom-and-pop stores can stay closed one day without having to worry about competition from the big chain stores."

Church Versus State
Underneath the competing commercial interests and talk of quality of life is a simmering debate on church versus state in American life. The Rev. Stephen Giordano, an outspoken supporter of Bergen County's blue laws, says Sunday should be protected as a day for family and a day for rest. Father Giordano, a pastor at the Reformed Church of America in Bergenfield and spokesman for the Bergen County Council of Churches, said that while he shied away from phrases like "Sunday is for going to church" or "we need to maintain the Sabbath," he preferred saying things like, "Life is hectic, and we need to reduce stress."
"Some people, who are members of faith communities, see this issue through a religious lens," he said. "But it's not a church issue, it's a quality-of-life issue."
Civil libertarians do not buy that, however. Blue laws, first enacted in the Colonies in the 17th century, were imposed to enforce often religiously based puritanical morals.
The courts have largely disagreed with that interpretation. When the constitutionality of blue laws was put to the test in 1961, in the case of McGowan v. Maryland, the United States Supreme Court ruled that while blue laws might have originally had a religious purpose, they had become secularized and now simply provide a day of rest.
"People can come up with whatever justification they want now, and the courts buy it," said Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State. "But I think it's a decision with blinders on, to say that this is not based in religion. It ignores why the laws were originally started."
And Deborah Jacobs, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, said that if Paramus wanted to control traffic, it should do it through zoning or such limitations on travel as banning cars with fewer than two occupants on certain roads rather than controlling traffic through sabbatarian legislation.
"Imposing the practices of one particular religion on a community goes against the spirit of religious freedom," Ms. Jacobs said.
In the final analysis, however, even civil libertarians acknowledge that issue of blue laws is becoming increasingly moot. Most have gone the way of pedal pushers and black-and-white televisions. Aside from restrictions on liquor sales, which are not uncommon, the few blue laws that remain are in pockets around the country.
In Clark County, Nev., for instance, car dealers must close Sundays. And South Carolina stores are prohibited from selling anything but food, tobacco, hosiery, undergarments and light bulbs before 1:30 p.m. on Sunday.
But for Ms. Layton, the business manager of Cedar Lane, her only concern is Bergen County and how the laws are hurting her ability to drum up new business. As long as the blue laws remain on the books, she said, all the faux gaslights and antique-looking benches in the world will not revitalize downtowns throughout the county.

HEADLINE: RESTAURANTS; 
Non, Non, Nouvelle

BYLINE:  By DAVID CORCORAN 

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR 

 BODY:
YOU can't miss it. Epernay is the restaurant on the corner of Park Street and Bloomfield Avenue with the two-story rooster on the wall.
 The mural, something of a Montclair landmark, long predates the restaurant, which is just 16 months old. (Mark Papera, the chef, says he was going to plant the name Epernay on his first child or his first restaurant, whichever arrived first. Close call: his wife and co-owner, Courtnay, is due in July.) But the big, jaunty rooster -- painted in 1980 by Thomas Reitter of Chatham -- nicely captures the Francophile elan of this bustling, thriving brasserie. 
 Mr. Papera, 29, is American through and through. He grew up in nearby Verona, graduated (along with Mrs. Papera) from Cornell University's School of Hotel Administration and worked in a succession of prestigious kitchens in Manhattan.
But he was shrewd enough to recognize that this prosperous, Left Bankish town, a magnet for every kind of fashionably casual restaurant, was missing the kind it really needed: a French French place, a place you could stop in every night for mussels and frites and hanger steak, a place with French cigarette posters on the walls (no smoking, however) and a shorthand version of the menu stenciled on the mirrors.
Of course, such a place would not last long, especially in food-obsessed Montclair, if the cooking didn't meet high standards. For the most part, it does. Mr. Papera has a sure hand, if not a highly adventurous one. He uses top-flight ingredients, and while prices are not low -- we averaged $50 a person for three courses, and diners must supply their own wine -- the menu offers enough bargains to make regular visits thinkable.
First-rate mussels in one of three sauces -- white wine and garlic, saffron and tomato, or curry and cream -- could easily be a meal at $9.75 for a big plate or $14.75 for a bigger one, along with, let's say, a plate of peppery frites and garlic aioli. It doesn't exactly encompass all four food groups, but you would not leave hungry or broke. Some combination of appetizers and side dishes, like the excellent herbed lentil salad, would also be economical. 
The most winning appetizer is a frisee salad, which comes with good blue cheese, bacon lardons and a little gravy boat holding a poached egg. Taken together with the giveaway baguette from Ecce Panis in New York, which is plunked down with a crock of herbed butter on the white paper that covers your table, it is so generous and satisfying that you could almost skip the main course -- not that the management would necessarily encourage it. 
Another well-balanced salad is composed of roasted beets, braised leeks, mache and walnuts. Onion soup, decent if lacking in stock flavor, requires poking your spoon through a molten explosion of broiled Gruyere. Steak tartare doesn't have much character, and salmon rillettes are just salmon salad with a fancy name. But two disks of foie gras terrine, at $14.50 the most expensive starter, are deeply buttery and filling, more indulgence than appetizer.
Main courses come in several packages. There is a menu of standard entrees, a list of three steak options (au poivre, Roquefort, frites) and a plat du jour. I was sorry to miss Tuesday's, cassoulet, but I'm confident it's terrific, with sausage from D'Artagnan in Newark and homemade duck leg confit. (It will take a leave of absence in warmer weather.) Bouillabaisse, the Wednesday plat, sounds just as enticing.
Instead, we visited on a Monday night, when the special was gibier, or game -- in our case, veal kidneys with a bell-like clarity of flavor and texture in a rich mustard sauce -- and on a Saturday, when it was beef Bourguignon. This stew, perhaps the most standard of brasserie standards, is very well made. The meat is faintly, agreeably ropy, in a deep and balanced red wine sauce with whole baby carrots, onions and potatoes. 
Among the entrees, the surprise winner was an immense, juicy Niman Ranch pork chop with braised potatoes and mild cabbage scented with juniper and fennel seed. Tender sea scallops with roasted potatoes and leeks weren't far behind, and neither was herb-and-pepper-crusted tuna over a bed of lentils. 
Calf's liver, so often overcooked and grainy and bitter that it has inspired whole generations of liver haters, is gamy and concentrated here, with a tart-sweet accompaniment of onions and roasted apples in sherry-vinegar jus. A roasted trout is moist and mild, infused with onion flavor. A couple of rungs up the calorie ladder are a great knob of lamb shank with a snowdrift of crusty, cheesy polenta; and smoky, tender but fatty seared hanger steak with a superfluous helping of marrow. 
The dessert menu is changing, Mr. Papera says, with two laggards -- an odd-tasting pineapple crepe and a poached pear so hard it could bounce -- leaving the cast. Creme brulee and chocolate mousse are pleasant if dutiful. His best effort by far is tarte Tatin, the tart apples offset by sweet pastry, the pastry offset by tart creme fraiche.
Epernay, named for the Champagne city 60 miles east of Paris, has a lot in common with that mural on its outer wall. Roosters are by definition cocky, and Epernay has an attitude, as you may find if you try to make a reservation for a Saturday night more than a week in advance or if, once seated, you ask to move to a better table. (Servers, however, are pleasant and professional.) Roosters are loud, too, and on a Saturday night Epernay could match them decibel for decibel. 
And roosters rule the roost. This one has wasted no time climbing to the top of Montclair's crowded, competitive restaurant scene.

HEADLINE: A Local Festival With Worldwide Draw 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SWANSBURG 

 BODY:
THERE are more than 700 film festivals worldwide each year, according to Variety, the show business trade publication. So why have one in Westchester?
 "Demographics," said Iris Stevens, director of the Westchester County Film Office. "Westchester probably has more residents connected to the film and television worlds than any other place in the United States, with the possible exception of southern California." 
 Ms. Stevens said this made the festival an attractive location for filmmakers seeking recognition. Last year, before the second annual festival was even over, the film office received e-mail messages from filmmakers as far away as England and Israel inquiring about how they could participate. The interest from abroad prompted the festival to add an international division this year. Entries will be shown from countries as diverse as Canada, Italy and Russia. On Thursday, the festival will honor the Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini.
Ms. Stevens said that despite its higher profile the festival would continue to encourage the efforts of local filmmakers by providing "a natural environment for them to show their work." 
On Thursday, the festival will feature "Don't Let Go," starring Katherine Ross and produced by a former Mount Vernon resident, Ken Schur. Also on Thursday will be a screening of "Sister Helen," a documentary about a nun in the Bronx, which was co-directed by Rebecca Cammisa of Tarrytown, who shared the best director award for a documentary at Sundance this year. The county is represented in the student division as well; one entry, a parody of the Lumiere brothers, is by a student at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers.
Though Westchester is frequently used as a film location -- to its great economic benefit -- the county continues to appeal primarily to city films looking for suburban settings. The festival has yet to make Westchester a more popular place to shoot films, Ms. Stevens said.
Of course one reason for having a festival is simply because "it's a lot of fun," as County Executive Andrew J. Spano put it. He said he is particularly looking forward to meeting Mr. Giannini. "Giannini was my mother's maiden name," he said. "I'm going to see if we are related."
Tickets to the festival, which go on sale tomorrow, can be bought at the Clearview Cinema in Greenburgh; they are $8 a day ($5 with a student ID) or $35 for the week. Complete listings are available at www.westchestergov.com/filmoffice.

HEADLINE: COMMUNITIES; 
The Bottom of the Cup

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLL 

DATELINE: MAPLEWOOD 

 BODY:
THERE'S a tempest in a coffee pot brewing here these days.
 After selling baked goods and fresh coffee to commuters at the Maplewood train station for the last three years, Joyce Reynolds has to leave. 
 Ms. Reynolds is the owner of Heavenly Scents Express, a coffee shop that opened as part of the Maplewood Concierge Company, a group of more than 79 local merchants who provide services from dry cleaning to roof appraisals to more than 2,000 commuters who use the station every day. 
But difficulties getting commuters to sign up for the services, coupled with financial strains as a result of the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, led the company that sublets the coffee shop area to Ms. Reynolds to negotiate with a larger company. Ms. Reynolds has to be out by May 1.
"We need someone with deeper pockets to ride these high and lows of the economic times," said Bob Klein, chairman of MCC, the company that sublet the space to Ms. Reynolds. "This is part of the evolution of what is a great idea and what will continue to be a great service for commuters."
Trying to mollify outraged commuters who have grown fond of Ms. Reynolds, Mr. Klein said that she would be welcome to work at the coffee counter.
"Ultimately, it's her choice, and if she wants to leave, we will all certainly miss her," said Mr. Klein.
Holding back tears, Ms. Reynolds said: "I am my own boss and extremely independent. I love this place, but I can't see myself working for a company."
For now, Mr. Klein said MCC was negotiating with a company that he declined to name. Under the new plan, MCC will sublet the train station property to the new company, the local merchants will still provide the services with expanded hours during the week and will allow the location to be open on the weekends and "provide a full gamut of services on site like never before."
That is little consolation for Ms. Reynolds, 51, who retired from her full-time job as a nurse four years ago and then opened a cafe, a dream of hers, in the village. "The funny thing is that I don't even drink coffee," she said last week from behind the counter.
Although she had to close the cafe last year, business at the train station has flourished.
Ms. Reynolds, who lives in Jersey City, rises at 3:50 every morning and is at work behind the counter by 5:15.
Over the years Ms. Reynolds has forged friendships with many of the commuters and says they are the reason she gets out of bed every morning.
"They will call me and ask if I can put money in the meter for them," she said. "Or if they are short on money, they can pay me the next day. It's no problem."
In addition, there are weekly contests for free coffee, and even a field trip to a Newark Bears game scheduled for June.
"It's like friends stopping by my kitchen for a quick cup every morning," she said. "We interact, and have gotten to know each other. It's almost like family."
Her customers -- also her friends -- agree.
"She is a wonderful person and is great to the town," said Sharyn Rushing, a commuter from Maplewood. "She knows all of her customers' names and even knows some of their kids' names. It's tough to find someone like that."
Ms. Reynolds also knows the train schedules by heart, and who takes what train. 
"Steve is late today," she said as a man came to the counter for a cup of coffee.
"She's right," said Steve Harris. "My normal train left about an hour ago. Joyce brings a spark of life to the station and to the mornings."
Pictures of children, pets and family portraits hang on the wall.
"A lot of them leave really early in the morning," Ms. Reynolds said. "The pictures on the wall give them a chance to see the people they love before getting on the train."
Contemplating a return to full-time nursing after the shop closes, she said she planned to weigh her options. "I wish it were different," she said, "but I take it as it comes and just hope for the best."
As Joseph Marchese, another commuter, put it: "There was coffee before Joyce, and there will be coffee after she is gone, but I doubt it will be the same atmosphere. She has become part of life here, part of the morning routine."

Keys to a Rental Villa May Be Cheaper Than You Think

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
AMONG cost-conscious travelers, the thought of renting a villa is unlikely to spring to mind. But some of these rentals are surprisingly affordable, especially if you're traveling with a group or a large family.
 Not only can you cook your own meals and do your own laundry -- with maid service optional in some instances -- but you now may also be able to take advantage of deep discounts because of the soft economy worldwide and the overall decline in travel since Sept. 11. If your travel plans are flexible, you may be able to negotiate great deals in certain places in the off-season weeks ahead. 
 In the Caribbean, for example, the off-season begins in mid-April and runs through mid-December. During that period, villa rentals can drop as much as 40 percent to 50 percent, villa brokers say. In Europe, the most expensive months are July and August, when most Europeans go on vacation and a two-week stay is often required. But rentals at other times -- now through the early spring, for instance -- can be discounted as much as 60 percent, brokers say.
Even if you don't want to travel at off-peak times, you can still uncover bargains by shopping around.
Cecil Jones, the owner of Just France, a company with offices in Berwyn, Pa., said that as many as 70 percent of the villa owners he represents did not raise their rates this year, as they normally would, because of concerns about soft demand.
Wimco, a company in Newport, R.I., that specializes in villas in the Caribbean and Europe, has many specials on its Web site. Last week, it featured four- to seven-bedroom villas in the Umbria region of Italy, starting at $4,190 a week. The rates, good through early 2003, have been reduced 15 percent since January. If you rent certain villas in St. Barts for a week by April 15, the site also gives you a free second week in the off-season later this year.
ResortQuest International, which specializes in renting villas and homes throughout the United States, is offering discounts this spring and summer in southwest Florida and at ski resorts in the West -- and the rate cuts are up to three times deeper than they were last year, said David Levine, chairman of ResortQuest, based in Memphis. Through April 20, for example, the company is renting two-bedroom beachfront homes in Naples, Fla., at $161 a night, with a minimum stay of seven nights. That price is three times lower than rates for comparable accommodations at many hotels in the area. Shorter stays usually cost more. 
Travelers who rent a home in certain states for at least five nights this summer will receive a bonus from ResortQuest -- two free nights at a ski-resort home next winter. There is one string, though: you have to buy an additional four nights at the ski resort. 
Expedia.com offers vacation homes and villas in Florida, Las Vegas and Montana that are discounted 10 percent to 20 percent below the owners' usual rental rate, said Robert Hohman, vice president for lodging. 
In fact, a cursory search for villas on the Internet will uncover countless promotions. But some guidelines can help pin down the right place at the right price.
Before choosing a company, figure out where you would like to go, and when. Some companies -- like Prestige Villas, La Cure, Wimco and International Chapters -- offer villas in many destinations and at many prices. Others focus on specific regions. Resorts Management and St. Barth Properties specialize in the Caribbean. Abercrombie & Kent, Best in Italy, Homes Away, Just France and Rentvillas.com focus on Europe. Some companies, like CyberRentals .com and VacationHomes.com, do not rent homes, but carry ads from homeowners or managers.
Before signing a contract, check the reputation of the rental company. Get references from friends who have rented villas, or work with a knowledgeable travel agent. If you are renting in the United States, you can also contact the local Better Business Bureau, Chamber of Commerce or Board of Realtors.
Experts say it may be best to rent from a company that inspects its properties regularly. CyberRentals.com, VacationHomes .com and Expedia say they do not inspect each home they offer, though each said it would drop homes if complaints were received and not properly addressed.
BEFORE renting, you should also understand all fees and the services they cover. Most companies do not include local taxes or other surcharges in their rates, and these can mount up. Some Caribbean islands, for example, impose taxes as steep as 17 percent on villa rentals. Companies with more expensive villas, like Homes Away and International Chapters, often include concierge service in the prices.
Check, too, on payment requirements. Most villa companies require a down payment at the time of rental and final payment weeks before your arrival.
Diane Hilliard, a travel agent in Stillwater, Minn., says villas are best for travelers "who are not Type A personalities who want to go, go, go."
"Renting is great for multigenerational groups, because you can eat at home and be with your family," she said. 
Jim and Judy Bode of Plandome, N.Y., can appreciate that. Almost every year, they rent a five- or six-bedroom villa on the island of Mustique in the Caribbean with four other couples, spending $6,000 to $7,000 a week. "The price is similar to what you'd pay at a high-end resort, but you get better value," said Ms. Bode, 48, a marketing consultant.

It's 5 P.M. Friday. Know Where Your Weekend Is?

BYLINE:  By MAGGIE JACKSON 

 BODY:
TO Jared R. Yaffe, a telecommunications executive, the phrase T.G.I.F. -- thank God it's Friday -- has no special significance.
 "We have to consider Saturday and Sundays just another day to survive; the work never stops," said Mr. Yaffe, 23, who works at Nobel Ltd., a provider of prepaid international telephone services that is based in Newton, Mass. 
 As chief technology officer and vice president for marketing, he is in the office on many a Saturday and nearly every Sunday, busy calling days for customers. Often, he runs into co-workers. 
Is the industrial age invention of the weekend going the way of the rotary dial telephone? Only 80 or so years after most American workers became entitled to two days off after working Monday through Friday, this last frontier of free time is being increasingly colonized by work.
In a global economy and a consumer society that demand nonstop service, many more people are working outside the traditional 9-to-5 weekday schedule. At least one-fourth of the country's 130 million workers toil on Saturdays, Sundays or all weekend for their main jobs, according to the latest data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
But even people like Mr. Yaffe, who are not formally signed up to work weekends, are doing so more often. Cellphones, pagers and e-mail allow them to reach a client quickly as they watch Little League games on Sunday mornings, or to close deals between courses at Saturday dinner parties. The trend is hard to quantify, but a national study last year by the nonprofit Families and Work Institute in New York found that more than 40 percent of employees used technology often or very often for work purposes during time off. 
"Weekends are just blending into the workweek," said Bill Sirois, chief operating officer at Circadian Technologies, a research and consulting firm in Lexington, Mass., that specializes in work force issues. "It's just another day."
Of course, not all these people are working seven days in a row. A store clerk who clocks in on Sunday usually has a weekday off, and some workers may now have more free time from Monday through Friday. But in blurring the lines between weekend and weekday, work often trumps rest, researchers say. In the process, they say, friends and family often spend less time together.
"The weekend is the place where you locate good family ties, leisure time and good ties within the neighborhood and community," said Christena E. Nippert-Eng, an associate professor of sociology at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago and author of "Home and Work: Negotiating Boundaries Through Everyday Life" (University of Chicago Press). "If you get rid of the weekend, then anything that's traditionally located in the weekend is going to suffer."
Until the 20th century, American workers commonly had only one day off a week -- the choice of day often depending on their religion. It wasn't until a big push from organized labor in the 1920's that workers generally became entitled to two days off, noted Benjamin K. Hunnicutt, a professor of health, leisure and sport studies at the University of Iowa. "They saw the five-day week as the next step," he said.
The boundary between free time and work can depend on technology. As mobile technologies proliferate, people find it easier to stay connected to work seven days a week. An online survey of 2,200 professionals conducted last month by Linkage Inc., a corporate training and consulting firm in Lexington, Mass., found that 97 percent spent at least some time on the weekend or other days off doing job-related work. 
"I personally find that when I'm on e-mail on the weekends, I get instant answers from colleagues," said Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families and Work Institute. 
Some offices, though, have tried to move away from the trend -- and from work that interrupts vacations. In 1998, for example, Roger Dunbar, then the managing partner for the Northwest at Ernst & Young, issued a memo to employees outlining how they could take a technology-free vacation -- by arranging, for instance, to have clients contact colleagues. Vacations, he wrote, "should be free of as many work distractions as possible."
Since then, about two-thirds of the company's regional offices have adopted such policies, which also state that unless a client needs help, employees should not leave voice mail and e-mail messages on weekends for colleagues with expectations of receiving answers before Monday. Employees do not have to check their messages during weekends.
"There's an important difference between handling work on a weekend in the rare instance it needs to be handled, and remaining plugged in on the remote chance something needs to be handled urgently," said Deborah K. Holmes, director of Ernst & Young's Center for the New Workforce. The company also does not hold meetings or training sessions on weekends, she added.
For many people, however, weekend conferences and seminars have become part of life. So, too, has the classroom: The number of executive M.B.A. programs, which often require attendance on weekends, has more than doubled in the last 15 years, to 155, according to the Executive MBA Council, a trade group for the programs. 
Business travelers, too, may give up Saturdays and Sundays at home, to take advantage of lower air fares and hotel room rates on weekends. Saturday nights are now the busiest night of the week at most hotels, partly because more corporate travelers are staying weekends, said Randy Smith, chief executive of Smith Travel Research in suburban Nashville. He noted, though, that many of them are not always working. Some may use their extra time to pursue leisure activities or take side trips.
The Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan has been booked solid on recent weekends, and corporate groups are the second-biggest market segment on weekends, after leisure travelers, said Eric O. Long, the general manager.
MORE weekend work has migrated to the factory floor, too. Once the territory of the heavy industrial sector, like steel mills that had to keep smelters hot, weekend shifts are now common in all kinds of manufacturing, retail, telemarketing and some Internet operations centers.
Factories that move to seven-day schedules typically increase productivity by 50 percent -- production hours are expanded by 40 percent and the plant becomes more efficient by not having to stop and start, according to Mr. Sirois at Circadian.
Helping companies move to around-the-clock schedules is the fastest-growing part of business at Circadian, the Massachusetts research consulting firm. About 25 to 30 companies a month have been signing up for its seminar on the topic since it was first offered a year ago.
Still, workers may have difficulty adapting -- even when periodic weeklong breaks are offered to make up for lost weekends. "It sounds nice at first," said David Mitchell, Circadian's publications manager. "The thing you hear a year later is about guys who are sitting home all day while their spouses are at work, or their kids are at school, and they have nothing at all to do." 
Mr. Yaffe at Nobel, for one, knows that he's giving up an active social life by working long hours and weekends. But he sees his schedule as necessary for staying competitive and advancing his career.
Heather Carb, 34, a bakery manager at a grocery store in suburban Philadelphia, also has mixed feelings about working weekends, even though she has done so for five years. But she plans to keep her schedule because it fits her needs for child care. She and her husband, Charles Penn, share the care of their 1-year-old daughter during the week, and on Tuesday and Wednesday, her days off, Ms. Carb has custody of her 12-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son from her first marriage.
"Most people aren't going to consider Sunday a normal weekday," she said. "But I think that probably to figure out ways to work your schedule, you need to look at Saturday and Sunday as a regular day."
Some researchers agree. "We may have a seven-day workweek, but we may also have a seven-day weekend," said J. Walker Smith, president of Yankelovich, the marketing consultants. "People may try and strike a balance every day."

God and City Hall Lock Horns on White Plains Road

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
Pastor Ben Anthony of the Bible Fellowship Pentecostal Assembly on White Plains Road thinks that churches can be a big help to his community. When his church moved in, he said, the drug dealers on the corner moved away. 
 "Rather than have these buildings abandoned," he said, "at least we're doing something positive." 
 Some of his neighbors cautiously disagree. By occupying vacant storefronts, they say, the churches are throwing a wrench into plans to revive the once-bustling thoroughfare. Others say the churches and temples springing up in private homes in the area bring crowds, noise, hazardous building conditions and Sunday parking problems.
Religious gatherings in homes are generally legal. But this year, someone complained about Shiva Parvati Maneir, a Hindu temple in a residential basement on White Plains Road. On Feb. 3, as morning services were ending, fire and building departments officials entered the temple, found hazardous conditions and posted an order requiring the temple to vacate the premises. Temple officials, who said they had spent $25,000 renovating the basement, were outraged.
"There are maybe dozens of places like this in the Bronx; I don't know why they came down on us," said Shyam S. Boodram, the temple's president. "We have built something here where people are so happy to come worship on Sunday, and now they can't come."
But Ilyse Fink, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department, said the violations -- low ceilings, and insufficient exits in a wood-framed building -- were "genuine problems."
"I don't think under any circumstances that the church could be legal," she said.
Within three blocks of the temple are at least 10 other houses of worship, and there are many others farther south.
Carmen Angueira, the district manager of Community Board 12, said these houses of worship can stymie economic revival.
"We need to look at what we need to revitalize, but with the churches there, I don't know how we would do it," Ms. Angueira said. Since liquor licenses cannot be granted to businesses within 200 feet of a church, restaurateurs might be harder to attract. 
A sign at the Living Hope Church of God, next to Pastor Anthony's, seems to offer a prediction: "You can't stop God." SETH KUGEL

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/Toyota Matrix and Pontiac Vibe; 
Dude, Where's My Car?

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE KREBS

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
IN the groovy 1960's, Pontiacs were far out. Who didn't want to cruise, or burn rubber, in stylish, powerful, youthful cars like the Firebird, LeMans and GTO?
 In the 70's and early 80's, Toyotas were totally awesome. Thrifty, reliable, sort-of-sporty small cars -- like the Celica and Corolla -- were what first-time buyers wanted in times of gas lines and economic turmoil. 
 But the classic muscle-car and small-car formulas no longer play well among young adults. Sales of the Firebird have been sliding for years; Pontiac will end production of that pony-car icon this year. And with gas so cheap, the small-car market has shriveled.
Both Pontiac and Toyota built their franchises on youth appeal, but their customers are graying. (Pontiac's average buyer is 42; Toyota's is 45.) The companies have mostly failed at attempts to become cool again.
The two companies, like most of the auto industry, are struggling to figure out what 70 million echo boomers -- roughly aged 8 to 25 -- will want in cars. This group of potential buyers rivals the baby boomers in size.
The 2003 Pontiac Vibe and Toyota Matrix represent bets that young people want sporty cars that are also practical and versatile, capable of hauling both friends and gear. While the Vibe and Matrix spring from the platform of the '03 Toyota Corolla sedan, they defy traditional categories. They have four doors and carry five people like a sedan, but their rear hatches open like those of a station wagon or minivan. They are available with all-wheel drive like sport utility vehicles. Competitors include other automotive mongrels -- the industry calls them "crossovers" -- like the Chrysler PT Cruiser, Ford Focus ZX5 and Mazda Protege5.
The Vibe and Matrix, which went on sale last month, are mechanically identical. Both are built by Toyota, although in different places (the Vibe in Fremont, Calif., and the Matrix in Cambridge, Ontario). Their differences lie chiefly in styling, prices and trim.
Pontiac learned some painful lessons with its last effort to woo young people. Its minivan-based Aztek was priced too high -- it started at $21,000 and could hit $30,000 with options -- and looked too strange. The Vibe has a competitive starting price of less than $17,000, and its styling is trim and athletic, with attractive proportions and a far prettier rump. But it still has some traditional Pontiac styling touches, like a twin-port grille, cat's-eye headlamps and wide, ground-hugging stance.
Designs of Toyota's youth-oriented vehicles have been all over the map, from the conservative Corolla to the oddly proportioned Echo. The Matrix bears no resemblance to either, but while its front end is attractive enough, its rear seems odd. The roof slopes awkwardly and a lip protrudes over the back window like a stunted spoiler. The rearmost side windows look pinched.
I personally prefer the look of the Vibe, and it got more thumbs-ups in my unscientific surveys -- including yes votes from a couple of 20-something body-piercing artists. Similarly, youngsters at a skateboard park thought it was cool. The Matrix got mixed reviews on campus; several college students called it "funky" -- a term they seemed to apply as both compliment and criticism.
The interiors are pretty much alike, and you sit high in both cars. The seats come only in cloth, not leather. The back of the front passenger seat folds forward, with the seatback forming a flat work surface. The rear seats fold to make a flat floor. which is not carpeted. The smooth plastic surface was great for wet gear, but it set my groceries sliding.
An available tie-down system consists of parallel tracks that run the length of the compartment, with eight adjustable sliding anchors to secure things like bicycles.
There are lots of power sources, including three in the center of the dashboard; one of these is a 115-volt outlet that can power a laptop computer. All through the car are storage nooks: open trays, covered bins, door pockets, cup holders and coin holders.
A premium audio system is available with an in-dash CD changer. Another option is a DVD-based navigation system.
Both cars have a cockpit feel. Gauges are set into four chrome rings (which caused distracting reflections at night). Another peeve was the rear wiper, which doesn't cover the entire back window.
The Vibe comes in three versions: base, AWD (with all-wheel drive) and GT. The Matrix is offered as Standard, XR and top-of-the-line XRS models. The Vibe's base prices range from $16,900 to $20,100, the Matrix's from $15,155 to $19,815.
In both cars, the engine in the base, midlevel and all-wheel-drive versions is a 1.8-liter four-cylinder with variable valve timing. It makes 130 horsepower with front drive and 123 with all-wheel drive.
The base and midlevel versions, like my cobalt-blue Matrix XR test car, have a five-speed manual transmission or an optional four-speed automatic; only the automatic comes with all-wheel drive. The base engine had plenty of round-town power, and the manual transmission felt sporty, though the shifter didn't always slide neatly into gear.
My Vibe test car, a "salsa red" GT, had the 180-horsepower engine and a six-speed manual. The car was peppy, but the six-speed felt very notchy and the clutch was jerky.
Both engines sounded buzzy -- a surprise, given that the Corolla is an exceptionally quiet small car. But maybe the target audience won't notice if they crank up the volume.
With their small dimensions and well-tuned handling, the Vibe and Matrix are agile. And they are so roomy that one assumes, when parking, that they are bigger than are.
Neither Vibe nor Matrix has been crash-tested by the government. They both have three-point safety belts for all five seats and two-stage front air bags, which deploy at different rates depending on the severity of a crash. Side air bags are optional for the front seats, and antilock brakes are standard or available on all versions.
The quality should be outstanding. Both cars were engineered by Toyota and are built in factories with excellent reputations.
Perhaps the Vibe and Matrix are not everything that echo boomers want, but with spirited performance, distinctive styling and roomy accommodations -- plus reasonable prices -- they may appeal even to the middle aged. Think of them as a bridge over the generation gap.

HEADLINE: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS; 
Chocolate Works Its Charm on the Brooklyn Waterfront

BYLINE:  By TINA KELLEY 

 BODY:
IT roughly at the midway point between two of the biggest holidays of the chocolate season, Valentine's Day and Easter, Jacques Torres realized that after more than a year spent running Jacques Torres Chocolates, he had not ordered enough ingredients.
 "We have been wiped out completely," he said cheerfully. "We're 10 days off our schedule." 
 For Mr. Torres, the former executive pastry chef at Le Cirque 2000, the pressures of managing a chocolate factory and retail store are a relative cakewalk compared with the long hours and relentless reviews that come with performing at a top-rated restaurant. 
Mr. Torres, who grew up in Provence, decided in December 2000 that he needed a change from the restaurant business. Together with Ken Gotto, his sous chef, and Kris Kruid, his partner at home and at work, he opened his store and factory on the Brooklyn waterfront between the Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges.
Though he still works about 12 hours a day, the move to full-time chocolate suits him, not to mention the public. "You can say 'apple' in front of people, or 'pear,' but if you say 'chocolate' -- it's a magic ingredient," said Mr. Torres, 43. "It has the same compound your brain produces when in love. That perhaps helps people to eat chocolate. It is a mood elevator."
His customers come from as far away as Minnesota. Some stop by almost daily. They confess their addictions to the woman behind the counter, as they address that niggling emptiness that only chocolate can fill, even at $20 per half-pound.
The intersection of chocolate and messing around, if not full-scale love, is evident in the retail store, which shares 66 Water Street with the factory. The store sells concoctions like Wicked Hot Chocolate (with ancho and chipotle chilis, supposed aphrodisiacs) and Body Butter ("Don't make us give you directions," the label says).
Nationally, of course, chocolate is big business, seemingly impervious to swings in the economy. The Chocolate Manufacturers Association, a trade group in Vienna, Va., has estimated that chocolate retailers sell more than $13 billion worth a year. Recent news about the possible health benefits of dark chocolate has bolstered the market, and "extreme chocolate" -- particularly the dark varieties -- is becoming more popular, said Susan Fussell, an association spokeswoman.
Valentine's Day is probably the biggest single sales day for boxed chocolates, she said, with Easter the second largest.
Mr. Torres would not divulge exact figures for his Valentine's Day sales or the year, but he said Valentine's sales were double those of 2001, when the store had just opened.
His success has been noted. Although the number of boutique chocolate manufacturers is small, another noted pastry chef, Andrew Garrison Shotts, is starting his own in Manhattan through the Chocolate Loft, a cooking school. Mr. Shotts, the former pastry chef at the Russian Tea Room, is making handmade bonbons in 12 flavors that cost $1.20 each and change with the seasons.
Behind the walls that separate Mr. Torres's shop from the factory are many surprises. The door from the bathroom to the food preparation area, for example, locks electronically and can be opened only if you put your hand on a sanitizer -- an elegant way around those "Employees Must Wash Hands Before Returning to Work" signs. 
Visitors must wear hairnets reminiscent of the "I Love Lucy" chocolate-chomping episode; a picture from it is displayed nearby. 
Toward the back of his 5,000-square-foot domain is the French vacuum mixer, Mr. Torres's answer to the problem of oxidation, caused by tiny air bubbles that reduce shelf life in chocolate concoctions. He eschews chemical additives, and went to Europe in search of a way to keep his chocolate pure. The machine puts his ingredients under hundreds of pounds of pressure. "Everything is very concentrated, which allows for more concentration of flavor," he said. 
The flavors are carefully orchestrated. Mr. Torres says he is one of the few chocolatiers who uses real Champagne in his bonbons; Taittinger truffles are a featured product. Forty-four pound bags of Belgian chocolate are stacked around the working area, as well as boxes ordered over the Internet, from his Web site, www.mrchocolate.com.
On a recent day, the 40-foot-long coating machine with a refrigerated tunnel spat out chocolate-covered grapefruit rinds. Mr. Torres picks up the rinds up weekly from Le Cirque 2000, which sets them aside for him after using the juice. 
Chocolate, he explains, is seasonal in a way that transcends holidays. Raspberries and strawberries are preferred ingredients for summer, and coconut and citrus fruit for winter. Mr. Torres also offers over-the-top creations on occasion, though he sounds weary when asked about the chocolate Yankee Stadium he made for a customer in November.
"It's a nightmare," he said of fashioning the cardboard templates for the stadium walls. "It's not easy."
THE creation of the factory, from a 100-year-old industrial plant with a sloping floor, was a considerable challenge. An architect and a mechanical engineer told Mr. Torres that renovations would cost $600,000, or about five times his budget. "They turned around and left," Mr. Torres said. "No more architect, no more mechanical engineer." 
He still remembers his first customer. "Someone walked in and said, 'I would like a box of chocolate.' " After Ms. Kruid wrapped the package and the customer left, they gathered behind the counter. Mr. Torres demonstrated what happened next, with a hand-flapping gesture, accompanied by exclamations that sounded like "wah!"
"That was called the happy dance. Every time we get a good big order, we do the happy dance."

Day Trading Takes a Conservative Turn

BYLINE:  By DAN COLARUSSO 

 BODY:
EVEN at the height of the bull market, Lowell Koppel did not fit the mold of the hyperactive day trader who jumped in and out of technology stocks dozens of times a day. Instead, he relied on evenhanded options strategies to generate consistent returns that had little to do with the Internet stock bubble.
 Maybe that is why, after two years of stock market declines, Mr. Koppel, 66, a former software executive, is still trading 100 times a month. Last year, he said, his trading returned 11.5 percent. "I'm a conservative investor," he said from his home in Winchester, Mass. "I only use about 25 percent of my assets to do this stuff with. The rest is in bonds." 
 Day trading became a prominent part of the market landscape in the late 1990's as individual investors using online trading technology left their day jobs and leveraged their nest eggs to trade stocks, often jumping in and out of positions within minutes. The market downturn that began in early 2000 thinned these ranks by the thousands and forced out of business many firms that had provided traders with training, trading privileges and technology. 
Many of the individual traders who remain have adopted relatively conservative approaches. They say they are holding positions longer, using less aggressive strategies, diversifying their holdings and relying more on short-selling, the practice of borrowing shares to sell in the hope of buying them back later at a lower price. 
"In the old days it was, 'Buy whatever you can afford and go home happy,' " said Joseph Cammarata, president of Sonic Trading, a day-trading firm in New York. "Now, you have to try to preserve capital."
Michael Parness, 38, who runs TrendFund.com, which dispenses trading advice online, said, "I think the main difference is that you have to be willing to take less." The title of Mr. Parness's new book, "Rule the Freakin' Markets" (St. Martin's Press),shows that his confidence has not waned. He does, however, remind investors to take the same pleasure in buying and selling Goldman Sachs shares at a $2.50 profit as they once did in playing Juniper Networks for one-day gains of $30 a share.
"Everyone who's trading now is actually doing this for a living," said Don Bright, the head of Bright Trading, a day-trading firm with 42 offices and 600 clients in the United States. "The people who treated it like selling real estate on the weekends are gone."
Mr. Koppel, who has been trading for three years, said he had never been comfortable with pure stock trading. Trained as a chemical engineer, he gravitated to the complex math of options and spends days analyzing them for potential mispricings. 
"It's really only in the last six months that I've gotten my calculations to the point where I feel confident," Mr. Koppel said, adding that he gets most of his income from writing covered calls, a conservative strategy that involves buying stock and selling call options. The strategy sacrifices potential appreciation in the shares for guaranteed income from the sale of the options. 
The confidence was tested when the market was near its peaks, Mr. Koppel said. "Sometimes I felt bad because the stock indices were performing so well and the opportunity loss was large. Now, though, I just try to consistently make money and not worry about the indices." 
Teresa Appleton-Lutz, 37, began trading five years ago after leaving a job at Hewlett-Packard to care for her two children. She has moved from trading initial offerings and technology stocks that were so fashionable in 1999 to trading futures contracts. 
"It was so easy to find something to trade then," Ms. Appleton-Lutz said. For seven months, she said, she traded only three stocks, Ciena, Exxon Mobil and Mercury Interactive, a strategy that was successful until the market changed.
Now she takes comfort in trading E-mini futures, contracts based on major indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 or the Nasdaq 100 but sliced into smaller pieces for individual investors, and in reading books on charting, technical analysis and more sophisticated techniques. "When you trade futures on the market, you don't have to worry about a biotech company saying the F.D.A. is investigating it," she said. "You don't have to sweat that kind of stuff. You want to live to trade another day."
While their numbers have dwindled, active traders are prized by securities firms, which cater to their needs. Electronic trading systems -- often called direct-access trading -- have become widely available to those who want to trade often, but not necessarily at the pace of the day traders of the Internet boom. 
Some of the biggest companies in the online brokerage business, like Charles Schwab, Ameritrade and E*Trade, have taken steps to increase offerings for active traders in order to diversify their own revenue mix.
In early 2000, Schwab acquired CyberCorp, a direct-access trading firm, and renamed it CyberTrader. Since the takeover, the firm's active-trader roll has swelled to 10,000 from 2,500, Schwab executives say. That has helped the company weather a slump in the broader online trading business. Schwab added just 47,000 accounts in the fourth quarter of 2001, down from its peak of 359,000 in the first quarter of 2000; new accounts at Ameritrade dropped to 35,000 from 306,000 over the same period, according to a report from Putnam Lovell, an investment bank in San Francisco.
E*Trade licensed direct-access software from A. B. Watley, a day-trading firm, and Ameritrade uses direct-access software developed by TradeCast, another firm with day-trading roots.
"Active traders still are a very important part of the business," said Richard Repetto, an e-finance analyst at Putnam Lovell. "They're a small part of the customer base, but they are very profitable." 
Mr. Repetto said CyberTrader clients account for 13,500 of the 155,000 trades done "on an average day" through Charles Schwab. Considering that the firm has 7.5 million clients, the trades by the 10,000 at CyberTrader represent a significant chunk of business.
"Active trading is a viable piece of a big firm with a vertical strategy" that includes services beyond direct-access capability, said Gary Mednick, an executive vice president at A. B. Watley and former head of OnSite Trading, a day-trading shop. "The top 10 percent of traders is still producing 90 percent of the business" for brokerage firms.
BETH STELLUTO, a senior vice president for active-trader sales and marketing at Schwab, said company studies showed that active traders use just 37 percent of their investable assets for trading. A few years ago, it was not uncommon for day traders to mortgage their homes to raise trading capital. 
The industry regards the shift as positive, because it indicates that traders will withstand future market shocks better than they did the bursting of the Internet bubble.
Still, Mr. Bright, whose firm trades 20 million to 30 million shares a day, said re-educating traders as the market fell had rated a 7 out of 10 on a scale of difficulty. 
"You have to remind people not to be headstrong, so you can't limit yourself to buying first; you can short," he said. "You can't keep doing something that doesn't work. There were people just holding stock and praying it would go up."

As Demonstrators Take to the Streets, A Union Tries Watchful Waiting

BYLINE:  By FELICIA R. LEE; E-mail: fee@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AS theater goes, the pickets in front of the New York Marriott Marquis in Times Square have the right ingredients: a catastrophe (Sept. 11); people desperate for jobs (Marriott hotel workers); and a rich corporate villain (the Marriott hotel chain).
 Gathered on Broadway between 45th and 46th Street four days ago, 20 protesters assailed the air with signs saying, "Marriott, give us back our jobs," and chants of "What do we want? Jobs!" 
 As they have done since mid-January, the protesters gave out fliers calling for an international boycott of Marriott hotels. The workers assert that the company reneged on promises to replace the jobs they lost on Sept. 11, when the World Trade Center Marriott was destroyed. The protesters say Marriott, with 2,300 hotels worldwide and $10 billion in revenue last year, could easily give them all new jobs and offer counseling and other assistance, too. 
Kathleen Duffy, the spokeswoman for New York City Marriott, denied that any promises of new jobs were made to the 700 employees of the 800-room hotel. She said Marriott had helped displaced workers above and beyond anything required by union contract or ordinary decency, especially in today's bleak job market.
"It's unfortunate we can't place all these people," Ms. Duffy said. 
The back story, though, is not just the accuracy of the assertions. It's the conflict between the tactics of a plucky young group, called the National Mobilization Against Sweatshops, which stages the protests, and the New York Hotel Trades Council, the umbrella group that represents the six hotel employee unions. The council has 25,000 members, about 90 percent of the hotel workers in the city, including those at the Marriott. The two groups are not talking, although there has been no public animosity. 
While the sweatshop group has accused Marriott of being unfair and trying to hire nonunion workers, the union has taken a course of quiet investigation and watchful waiting to determine whether those claims are true. Union officials also point to their program that offers laid-off hotel workers everything from psychological counseling to help in applying for unemployment. 
As of last week, about 500 former trade center Marriott workers were among 2,930 hotel union members out of work in the worst winter for the city's hotels in seven years. With 4 out of 10 rooms empty in January, the industry was buffeted by the double blow of a recession and fewer tourists.
Some employees believe the union is too passive. Others simply like the idea of street action. They want jobs, and will take whatever white knight comes along. 
One sometime picket, Owen Lopez, a muscular 29-year-old native of Jamaica who worked as a housekeeper at the trade center Marriott, captured the sentiments of those disenchanted with Marriott.
"They humiliate us by saying we have to prove we qualify for assistance, when they know we qualify because we lost our jobs," said Mr. Lopez, detailing his dogged search from his home in Irvington, N.J., for a job at any hotel in the city. "A lot of us risked our lives that day to help hotel guests."
Karah Newton, one of the sweatshop activists leading former Marriott employees, said the union moves too slowly. Her group reached out to various disaster assistance centers in the city, she said, and is in touch with about 400 Marriott workers.
The sweatshop group, which is based in Downtown Brooklyn and has made a name for itself by standing up for workers at Chinatown factories and restaurants, is working with a group called Center for Immigrant Families on the Marriott campaign.
Peter Ward, president of the Hotel Trades Council, says too much is at stake for a street brawl without the intelligence to back it up. "We'll go to work on these guys by the numbers," he said. 
The council has asked Marriott for data on who has been hired at its other hotels since Sept. 11 and how disaster-relief funds were spent. Mr. Ward said the union agreement calls for workers from closed Marriott properties to get preference in hiring at other Marriott properties. The council is particularly interested in the hiring for the Marriott-managed Ritz-Carlton on Central Park South; it is scheduled to open this spring.
"I just want a job," said Julio Bernal, a bleary-eyed former waiter and bartender, who was among the protesters in front of the Marriott the other day, taking his white knights wherever he can find them.

A Winter of Turmoil Could Make Irish Stock Exchange a Target

BYLINE:  By BRIAN LAVERY 

DATELINE: DUBLIN 

 BODY:
IRISH winters don't come much harsher than this. The sleepy Irish stock exchange, accustomed to steady and predictable returns, has been rocked by problems at two of the country's biggest companies, dragging down the benchmark ISEQ index by nearly 12 percent since January.
 In one tumultuous week last month, the Elan Corporation, the drug maker, faced accusations of hiding its debt through Enron-style accounting, and Allied Irish Banks revealed that a trader at its American subsidiary in Baltimore had run up huge losses, now put at $691 million, on foreign exchange markets. 
 Stock analysts and investment managers here are quick to say that the problems at Allied Irish and Elan are isolated incidents. There has been little effect on other Irish companies, many of which can be traded in the United States as American depository receipts. 
The stock of Allied Irish has recovered to its levels before the announcement of the trading losses, and the remainder of the Irish financial sector remains strong. Shares in smaller institutions, like Irish Life and Permanent and Anglo Irish Bank, have risen more than 15 percent this year.
Elan, which suffered a blow when trials of its promising Alzheimer's drug were canceled because of side effects, is another matter. Its price decline in Dublin, 69 percent since the start of January to 17.3 euros, makes it the worst-performing company on the Dublin exchange.
It's hard to ignore big fish floundering in a small pond. A few months ago, the combined market capitalization of Allied Irish and Elan was 35 percent of the entire market. That has since fallen to 24 percent; the plunge has revived longstanding concerns about the viability of the Irish exchange as an independent market.
The bad news has also kept Irish stocks quite cheap by international standards. So far this year, the Irish market is trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of about 14.5, versus a multiple of more than 20 for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Though it has slowed recently, Irish gross domestic product grew at about 10 percent a year from 1995 to 2000. In contrast, "the evolution of the Irish stock market has been quite disappointing," said Jim Power, chief economist at Friends First Asset Management.
"The same companies that dominated the market 10 years ago are still in that position today," he added.
As a result, the Irish stock exchange could become a target for a merger or takeover by British or European markets, Mr. Power said.
While Ireland is a concentrated market -- the top 10 companies represent 80 percent of the market's value -- there has been a gradual infusion of new names. Companies like Elan and Ryanair, the successful low-budget airline, came to prominence only in the last five years. 
Some analysts are encouraged by the emergence of newer companies. "The market has reflected the dynamic changes in the Irish economy," said Noel O'Halloran, chief investment manager at KBC Asset Management in Dublin, which handles 6 billion euros of assets, or $5.25 billion. 
Gartmore Investment Management, based in London, set up its Irish Growth fund, traded in London and Dublin, in 1995, in anticipation of economic growth created by low tax rates and young, educated workers. The fund's net asset value has climbed 81.8 percent over the last five years. Ireland "is well positioned for whenever investment conditions pick up, wherever that comes from," said the fund manager, Gervais Williams, because many Irish companies have a strong presence abroad.
Investors in the United States may find it easier to buy shares of the New Ireland fund, a closed-end fund traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Managed by Bank of Ireland Asset Management in Dublin, it also specializes in Irish equities, with its largest holdings in the Kerry Group, an international food ingredients company that started as a dairy farmers' cooperative, followed by CRH, a building materials giant, and Allied Irish Bank.
"We are slowly positioning the fund to get greater exposure" to higher-growth areas like health care and telecommunications, said John Ford, the fund manager. Its investments include small private equity holdings in unlisted Irish companies. The fund has net assets of $81.8 million, according to Morningstar Inc., and it declined by 10.6 percent from Jan. 1 to March 1, lagging behind the S.& P. 500 by 9.42 percentage points and the ISEQ by 7.31 percentage points.
Irish technology companies have attracted international attention, sometimes raising funds through public offerings outside of Dublin. Parthus Technologies, which designs microchips for cell phones and other wireless devices, chose to trade its shares on Nasdaq and the London Stock Exchange. Baltimore Technologies, the security software developer, is still traded in London but was delisted from Nasdaq last year after its shares fell sharply.
Domestic investors here have been focusing recently on traditional industries. Gartmore Irish Growth's largest holding is in Glanbia, a dairy and consumer foods group. Both the Gartmore and New Ireland funds favor CRH, a building materials company that made 11 acquisitions outside Ireland over the last year and that reported 15 percent increase in pretax profits for 2001.
Foreign investment has been important for the small Irish market. As a result, said Tom Murphy, head of investment management at Mercer Investment Consulting in Dublin, "what companies need to do is get themselves on as many radar screens as possible."
That strategy may work as long as Irish companies are noticed for the right reasons: the recovery in Allied Irish Bank's shares has come mostly because of speculation that the Royal Bank of Scotland may prepare a takeover bid.

For Afghans, the Bank Is Often a Bag of Cash

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: KANDAHAR, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
LAST October at Da Afghanistan Bank, Mullah Muhammad Omar, the one-eyed warrior cleric who is the Taliban's proclaimed emir, wrote a check for 93,418,734 Pakistan rupees, or about $1.5 million. He wanted to write another one on the Taliban's American-dollar account with the bank, but he couldn't find the checkbook.
 "The checkbook is unavailable," a secretary wrote on the emirate's letterhead, "and so this letter is the same as a check and the bank should honor it as a check." 
 The amount was $3,488,222.85.
Mullah Omar signed the check and the letter in the tight, dark scribble that all officials under the Taliban regime recognized as his signature, and with that he cleaned out the Kandahar branch of Afghanistan's central bank.
Even before the latest conflict, Afghanistan's 14 million people, most of them subsistence farmers or nomads, had known nothing but war and deprivation for nearly a quarter-century. "Afghanistan, which has always been at the bottom of the poverty and social-indicator rankings of countries, must now be considered the poorest, most miserable state in the world," the World Bank said in a report last October. 
But the collapsing Taliban regime left Afghanistan's economy bankrupt; departing Taliban commanders even emptied the banks of adding machines, chairs and glasses for tea.
At a World Bank conference in January, participants projected that the country would need $15 billion in development money for infrastructure over the next 10 years -- nearly $5 billion in the next two and a half years alone. Distributing the initial aid will be a logistical challenge. In this country, money is moved from place to place in bags (last month, the country's interim leader, Hamid Karzai, brought back more than $1 million in bundles of cash from foreign donors by plane), or through a network of money changers whose system is named for the principle that makes it work -- hawala, the Arabic word for trust.
Afghans lost faith in banks after Mohammad Zahir Shah was deposed as king in 1973. Businessmen and other people with large sums began depositing cash with the money changers, whose centuries-old system has worked through wars and natural disasters. The changers use the money deposited with them for currency trading, their main income source.
Before the nation worries about bank capital, it will need human capital to create a banking system. Fazil Ahmed, Kandahar's new central bank branch manager, was a clerk just a few months ago and has only the most rudimentary understanding of finance. He keeps his money at home in a plastic bag.
Yusuf Pashtun, an aide to Kandahar's governor, Gul Agha Shirzai, said: "We've had to bring people out of retirement who remember how things worked during the time of the king. Some of them are over 80 years old."
The banks make no loans and take no deposits. They have only credits and debits as local administrations use the banks in tax collection and to pay expenses.
Most of the new government's revenue, aside from foreign aid, comes from duties levied on goods ferried by truck from neighboring countries. There is no unified customs administration, and each province collects what duties it can. None send any revenue to the central government for a more equal distribution around the country. Partly as a result, provinces that control borders crossed by active trading routes are now more secure than most others. They can afford to feed and clothe their armies and discourage the extortion practiced by soldiers in poorer regions.
But one of the few unifying forces binding rich and poor regions is likely to remain, for the foreseeable future, the centuries-old financial network based on cash and trust. That network is where the Taliban's money has most likely gone, people in Kandahar say, recalling how the Taliban's finance minister, Mullah Gul Agha, personally supervised the money withdrawal from the Kandahar vault at Da Afghanistan bank.
"Mullah Gul Agha came with four or five armed men," said Muhammad Ibrar, keeper of the vault, standing in front of its light-blue door.
Three bank officers, each with one of the three keys that must turn simultaneously to open the vault, unlocked the door and two of the Taliban's men went inside and carried out nylon feed bags full of money, which they loaded into a waiting Toyota Land Cruiser, Mr. Ibrar said. All that they left were bundles of old afghani bills in denominations too small to use because of inflation.
AS American bombs and anti-Taliban fighters hammered steadily at Taliban territory, Taliban officials pulled money out of other banks, too. They emptied the central bank in Kabul of about $6 million in various currencies in November, bank officials say. A few days later, in Kandahar, the province's governor sent his deputy to the Pashtun Business Bank and took the bank's one billion afghanis, equivalent to about $14,000 at the exchange rate of the day. The cash, which filled the bed of a pickup truck, has more than doubled in value since the Taliban's fall.
The money gives Mullah Omar plenty of cash to finance whatever activities he has planned. It may already have been distributed to bank accounts abroad through the country's money changers, who can transfer funds secretly to almost any city in the world.
At the money market in Kandahar, a crush of shouting, gesticulating men trade currencies in a small courtyard from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day, with an hour-and-a-half break for lunch. Amin Ullah, sitting cross-legged on a carpet in a small room on the second floor of the market, explained why the money changers remain loyal to the Taliban.
"The Taliban were good men," said Mr. Ullah, counting brick-thick bundles of American dollars in the dim light of a gas lamp. "The government here now is the same government that was here in 1992, and there was no security then."
He explained that Mullah Omar could deposit his cash with money changers in Afghanistan or Pakistan or Iran and the money changers would issue him a receipt that could be redeemed for the same amount from another money changer anywhere from Cairo to Chicago, minus a 1 percent fee. There would be no accounting to trace the transaction.
Inside another office, three brothers surnamed Aziz sat on the floor parceling bank notes from the feed bags of bills that arrive periodically on the backs of human carriers from Pakistan, six hours away by car.
Every few minutes, a telephone call came from their father, who was at a public telephone office in Kandahar, relaying buy or sell orders based on the changing currency rates he was monitoring with calls to a relative in Quetta, across the border in Pakistan.
Nur Ahmed, who works for the brothers, rushed in and out to the balcony, where a press of upstairs traders offer to buy or sell from the men in the packed courtyard below. "I'm selling afghanis," Mr. Ahmed shouted from the balcony, and a roar rose from the crowd as outstretched arms swung toward him like iron filings to a magnet, fingers signaling the rate at which each man was willing to buy.
The brothers complained that they had lost heavily in the currency swings and chaos that came with the fall of the Taliban.
Afghanis worth about $87,000 were stolen from their office at the money market in Kabul -- not by the Taliban, they said, but by thieves who would not have dared such a crime while the Taliban were in power.
Worse, the brothers were devastated by the surging value of afghanis as the Taliban fell. The brothers were holding mostly Pakistani rupees, and they now have to buy expensive afghanis when their depositors want to make a withdrawal. The afghani has since been roiled further by suggestions that the country temporarily adopt the United States dollar as its official currency.
"Will the U.S. government reimburse us for the money we've lost?" asked Abdul Rauf Aziz, the oldest brother.

HEADLINE: He Loves to Win. At I.B.M., He Did. 

BYLINE:  By STEVE LOHR 

 BODY:
THE revival of I.B.M. over the last nine years is most tellingly measured not in numbers but by its return to pre-eminence as the industry leader. Once again, I.B.M. is the model others follow.
 Consider the strategic debate behind the fevered proxy fight at Hewlett-Packard. Its planned purchase of Compaq Computer makes sense, Hewlett-Packard says, because the merger will make it more like I.B.M. A dangerous delusion, reply the deal's opponents. Who, they ask, could possibly compete broadly with I.B.M.? 
 Even the main question these days about I.B.M.'s future lends perspective. Sure, the skeptics say, I.B.M. is back with a vengeance, a powerhouse in the marketplace with strong profits. But, they ask, how much growth can be expected from a corporate giant with sales last year of $86 billion? 
In 1993, when Louis V. Gerstner Jr. became chairman and chief executive, the question asked about I.B.M. was whether it would survive. And in choosing him, the I.B.M. board had taken a historic gamble on a professional manager with no experience in the computer industry.
Last Monday was Mr. Gerstner's first day at I.B.M. bearing just one title -- chairman. He will keep it until year-end, then depart. On March 1, he was succeeded as chief executive by Samuel J. Palmisano, a 29-year I.B.M. veteran who built up the vital services business, which now represents about half of I.B.M.'s revenue and profits.
The rearview mirror holds little interest for Mr. Gerstner, who is 60. Yet in a lengthy interview last Monday at the company's headquarters in Armonk, N.Y., he reflected on his worries in taking the job, the challenges he faced and the reasoning behind his crucial strategic, organizational and technical decisions there. He spoke of where he thought I.B.M. had been smart and where luck had helped a lot.
He spoke of matters beyond I.B.M. as well. He explained why he believes there is no new economy, a statement that prompted boos from the dot-com world when he first made it in 1999. He answered the criticism he received in the industry in 1993, when he said, "The last thing I.B.M. needs now is a vision," and explained why he was right. And, ever the outsider in the computer business, he discussed what he thought was special about the industry, what was ordinary and what still irritates, even amuses, him about it.
Mr. Gerstner also offered a bit of personal reflection. After leading three large corporations and achieving vast personal wealth, he said that the enduring thrill of being a chief executive -- and the part he would miss -- was really quite simple. "I love winning," he said, pausing briefly before answering the question emphatically. "I love the process of leading an institution and being part of an institution that succeeds, that wins. I get excited by our success. I get very frustrated by our failures, too, but I enjoy the game."
At I.B.M., the Gerstner record is mainly a success story. "Lou Gerstner re-established the company's belief in itself," observed Andrew S. Grove, the chairman of Intel, who has known I.B.M. as a partner and competitor for more than two decades. "It's hard to describe how beaten down that company was."
When he took the job, Mr. Gerstner, a former McKinsey consultant who went on to become president of American Express and then chief executive of RJR Nabisco Holdings, was far from the obvious choice for guiding Big Blue, the fallen icon of American technology, back from the brink. Among I.B.M. directors, there had been a sharp debate over whether to hire a technologist or a professional manager. In the end, the board bet that I.B.M. needed a leader, a strategist and a manager -- Mr. Gerstner's portfolio of skills -- not an executive with a deep understanding of computer technology.
He also had qualms. "If the board had been wrong, and that was my big concern -- that underlying it all there was a technical problem in I.B.M. -- then it would have been a very short tenure for me," he said, smiling and shrugging.
THOSE misgivings are a distant memory. Even last week, it was clear that he does not plan to slow down until he leaves. Monday was his first day at the headquarters in two weeks. He had been on the road, going to Philadelphia, Boca Raton and Salt Lake City, and abroad in Stuttgart, Munich, London and Edinburgh, mostly meeting with I.B.M. customers.
The day was the equivalent of a corporate pit stop; he was headed out again on Tuesday, adding to the more than 1.1 million air miles he has logged since 1993. His travel regimen reflects his management philosophy: getting out of the office to deal with customers and dwell in the marketplace is an antidote to the corporate insularity that was nearly I.B.M.'s downfall.
He began traveling to meet customers and to visit I.B.M. outposts as soon as he took over, and what he heard guided his action. He also read. As a former McKinsey consultant, he asked first for the I.B.M. strategic plans, current and recent. There were plans aplenty, he found, strategic blueprints for each division, even down to the product level. By the end of his first month, Mr. Gerstner, who always carries two briefcases of reading material when he travels, had read thousands of pages of strategic documents.
The reading left him enlightened -- and appalled. I.B.M., he said, was filled with smart people who had recognized the industry's major technological and economic shifts. Yet I.B.M. had repeatedly failed to respond. "Part of the culture was a tendency to debate and argue and raise every issue to the highest level of abstraction," Mr. Gerstner said. "The process almost became one of the elegance of the definition of the problem rather than the actual execution of an action plan."
SO, a few months after arriving at I.B.M., when he said the last thing it needed was a vision, he was declaring a break with the old culture of introspection and foot-dragging. Had he spoken of vision at I.B.M., he said, he knew it would have started "a yearlong debate."
"And we didn't need the vision," he added. "We needed to save the company economically."
Instead, he gave marching orders to the I.B.M. troops. "We were going to build this company from the customer back, not the from the company out," he said. "That was the big message from my first six months in the company, that the company was going to be driven from the marketplace."
As one symbolic step, he abolished the ritual of the I.B.M. organization chart. These fold-out charts were minor masterpieces of draftsmanship and printing, an intricate latticework of lines, color-coded boxes and asterisks. Lovely to behold, they recalled the engineering drawings of Leonardo da Vinci, according to one executive. Producing them was a cottage industry within I.B.M., and thousands of them were pinned on the office walls of its workers.
When asked about how to revise the organization chart under his management, Mr. Gerstner declared there would be no more organization charts, that anyone asking for one was focusing on the wrong thing.
Early on, he also changed incentives to put I.B.M. and its people more in step with the marketplace. When he came to the company, only 300 employees received stock options. Today, more than 60,000 do. He told his top 300 executives soon after he arrived that he expected them to own I.B.M. stock equal to one to four times their yearly compensation.
Mr. Gerstner argues that strategy and corporate culture are intimately linked. "You can't talk a culture into changing," he said. "You can't just exhort people to be different. You've got to point to fundamental strategic changes you're going to implement in a company and then drive the execution of that strategy. And it is in the execution of the strategy that the culture begins to change."
The first major decision Mr. Gerstner made was to decide to keep the company together, not split it up into 13 loosely linked "Baby Blues." Under that plan, put forward by his predecessor, John F. Akers, in December 1992, some would be spun off as separate companies with their own names, like AdStar, for the disk storage unit.
This so-called federation plan was moving ahead briskly when Mr. Gerstner arrived. "It was an extraordinary Balkanization of the company under way when I walked in," he said. "There were investment bankers sticking their flag on every piece of I.B.M. they could."
Auditors had been hired, costing millions of dollars, to create stand-alone financial statements for the spinoff candidates. "Every unit had run for the hills," Mr. Gerstner recalled, "creating their own human resources policies, their own communications policies."
In theory, the federation plan addressed I.B.M.'s fundamental trouble -- that as an integrated company it was not quick and nimble. It would be better off aping the personal computer industry, where fast-moving technology specialists like Microsoft and Intel prevailed.
"That was the industry model that I.B.M. was responding to," Mr. Gerstner said. "And I looked at that and I said, 'Wait a minute, as a customer of I.B.M.'s, I'm not terribly drawn to that as a model for I.B.M.' "
Mr. Gerstner, an I.B.M. customer at American Express and RJR, liked the concept of "integrated solutions" -- that I.B.M. could distill the complexity of computing to solve business problems for companies. In his early travels for I.B.M., he heard similar sentiments from customers.
Aside from its breadth, in Mr. Gerstner's view, I.B.M. had another unique feature: its research prowess. "Now, I walk in and they're atomizing the company," he said. "I see both of I.B.M.'s distinctive competencies being destroyed."
Within 90 days of his arrival, Mr. Gerstner irrevocably decided to keep the company together. "I knew it was a big risk, but I never doubted that it was the right thing to do at I.B.M.," he said.
"What scared me" he added, was the need to do three things at once: change I.B.M.'s economic model, its strategy and its culture.
First, though, Mr. Gerstner had to cut costs. Work force cutbacks and plant closings were already under way, but he went deeper. In July 1993, he announced the company would eliminate an additional 35,000 jobs, bringing the declared total for the year to 60,000 and bringing the charge against earnings to $8.9 billion. As a result, I.B.M. reported a record loss of $8.1 billion in 1993 and, the next year, its worldwide employment fell to a low point of 220,000, from 302,000 in December 1992. 
Looking back, Mr. Gerstner pointed to three strategic decisions that were "the fundamental underpinnings of building an integrated company." First, he created a broad computer services unit that sold bundles of hardware, software, consulting and maintenance to manage business processes like manufacturing, purchasing or marketing.
I.B.M. had a services arm before, but it merely kept the company's machines up and running for customers. To be a real computer services ofices company, Mr. Gerstner noted, "it had to be product agnostic."
"The customer would not accept a services company if all it did was flog I.B.M. products," he said.
His decision to move into services set off "an incredible bomb in the company," Mr. Gerstner recalled, adding, "Here was a part of I.B.M. that was going to work closely with Oracle, Sun Microsystems and, God forbid, Microsoft." Yet IBM Global Services became the company's biggest business, the corporate vehicle that would, as Mr. Gerstner observed, "look at technology through the eyes of the customer."
His second crucial decision struck at another I.B.M. heritage, that of relying almost exclusively on its own homegrown technology. Before, when the company had gone outside -- when it plunged into the personal computer business in 1981 using Intel's microprocessor and Microsoft's operating system -- the move had been regarded as a grave mistake.
But by early 1994, Mr. Gerstner had decided that I.B.M. would move to "open systems." In other words, Mr. Gerstner said, "All of I.B.M.'s software would run on major competitive hardware, and all of I.B.M.'s hardware would support competitive software." To do that, the company would have to adopt standard software protocols that allowed different hardware and software products to talk to each other.
To Mr. Gerstner, the move toward openness was a technical manifestation of his broader strategy. "There's no way that you can get a company built around proprietary control to accept the open model unless they start with the customer and realize this is what the customer wants," he explained.
His third decision, made in 1995, was to fully embrace the Internet and what I.B.M. calls the "networked world" model of computing. Moving to open systems made it easier for the company to adapt to the Internet early. But the networked model of computing suited I.B.M.'s strengths -- big data-serving computers are the equivalent of power plants on the network, and the Internet shift moved the center of computing away from the personal computer.
As the Internet moved into the mainstream in the mid-1990's, it brought an explosion of computing complexity, as all kinds of hardware and software had to be able to connect to the global network. I.B.M.'s breadth and its services group were big advantages in this new environment.
"Here was a chance for I.B.M. to lead again," Mr. Gerstner declared. "We were able to articulate a role for I.B.M. in the networked world that spoke of the value of all we did."
I.B.M. welcomed the sudden spread of Internet-style computing as a gift, Mr. Gerstner admitted. "The company was extraordinarily lucky that the networked model of computing arrived in the mid-90's," he said. "And let me tell you, having worked in industries where the cycle of change is measured in decades, if not centuries, one of the things that is extraordinary about this industry is that if you miss a turn of the wheel you have a chance to get back in the game" every 10 years or so.
Still, it was his earlier decisions that put I.B.M. in a position to ride the Internet wave. Given the company's size, that strategy evolved quite rapidly. In late 1995, it formed an Internet division, which was not a product group, but more a corporate SWAT team to make sure the entire company was marching toward the Internet. Then, it carved out its niche, trumpeted in a massive advertising and marketing campaign, beginning in 1997, to push "e-business." 
Competitors scoffed and advertising experts scratched their heads, but the message resonated with corporate customers. 
The message -- helping companies do "e-business," documented in ads by examples -- remained consistent, as did the strategy. Amid the dot-com mania in 1999, Mr. Gerstner told Wall Street analysts that he regarded the hot Internet start-ups as "fireflies before the storm," suggesting that the big impact of e-business would be in the old economy. At the time, that was hardly conventional wisdom.
At the conclusion of Mr. Gerstner's tenure, his three strategic pillars have come together in what could be mistaken for the very word he avoided, a vision. And that strategy shift, actually executed, insured a real change in the corporate culture. 
THE company's sheer number of recent hires is a clear sign of that -- and the buildup of the services business is a big reason. IBM Global Services employs 150,000 people, up from 7,600 in 1992. All told, more than half of I.B.M.'s employees have worked for the company for five years or less. In 1992, the figure was 14 percent.
Having succeeded in an industry skeptical of outsiders, Mr. Gerstner feels free to assess it. The computer industry tends to go astray, he said, when it "tends to reach to promise value in utopian schemes" -- the paperless office, the cashless society, the notion that shopping Web sites would bring the demise of bricks-and-mortar stores.
"The payoff from information technology is going to be in making transactions and processes more effective and efficient," he asserted. "So it's not about creating a new economy, it's not about creating new models of behavior or new models of industry. It's about taking a tool, a powerful tool, and saying, 'How can I make my supply chain more effective and efficient, how can I make my purchasing process more efficient, how can I make my internal employee communications more effective and efficient, how can I as a government deliver services to constituents more efficiently and more effectively?' "
"So the computer," he continued, "is in a sense like the electric motor 120 years earlier. It's an invention that in and of itself is kind of interesting, but doesn't have a lot of value unless you like hitting the alt, control and delete keys, and all the other things you can do on a keyboard. Its value is in the application to other processes."
His reference to alt, control, delete -- the keys users strike to try to reanimate a personal computer, running Windows, that has crashed -- was a slap at Microsoft. Like many people, Mr. Gerstner, who travels everywhere with an I.B.M. Thinkpad notebook computer, finds PC's too hard to use. He believes the problem reflects the technical parochialism of the industry.
"There's an absence of concern about ease of use and almost a pride in technical complexity," he said. "What other industry would give you a product that, to turn it off, you first have to press a button labeled start? And you tell me one other industry where somebody could sell a product that you have to reboot on average five or six times a day to get it to work?"
Yet, unlike so many in the software business, Mr. Gerstner did not let his critique of Microsoft drive his business decisions. 
In 1996, he decided that I.B.M.'s OS/2 operating system could not compete with Microsoft's Windows. "Most of the big technical decisions we made were half as much business as they were technical," Mr. Gerstner explained. "I mean, the decision to basically stop fighting Microsoft with OS/2 was hardly a technical decision. It was a decision on my part that it looked like we had lost, so why don't we get on with doing something else?"
That kind of unsentimental pragmatism has served I.B.M. pretty well for the last nine years.

The Business of America's National Pastime Is Unpatriotic Obfuscation

BYLINE:  By LEONARD KOPPETT; Leonard Koppett has been a baseball writer for 52 years. His revised 1991 book, "The Thinking Fan's Guide to Baseball" (Sports Illustrated/Total Sports), has been published in paperback.

 BODY:
Many have scoffed at baseball's claim that 28 of its 30 teams lost money over the last seven years, including $500 million in 2001 alone. But I have no basis for doubting their figures or their sincerity.
 What shocks me is their utter lack of patriotism. 
 How?
By refusing to share, with the rest of the American business community, the secret of their greatest discovery: how to lose millions year after year, stay in business and even double their revenue. 
Such selfish secrecy can only be called unpatriotic.
What with the war against international terrorism, our first recession in a decade, rising unemployment, increasing business failures, record bankruptcies (including a giant like Enron), falling stock prices and new pressures on workers and industries from global competition -- at a time like this, they have found a unique formula for success through failure, which can be maintained indefinitely. 
And they won't tell the rest of us how they do it?
It's particularly disturbing because President Bush is one of their recent alumni. He deserves their help.
This no way for the custodians of Our National Game to behave. 
By their own testimony, before Congress, they claim that their revenue increased from $1.8 billion to $3.5 billion in five years -- but their expenses went up to $3.8 billion in 2001. 
Since they were paying the players roughly $1 billion in 1996, they had at least $800 million available for everything else then. Now they pay the players $2 billion and have $1.5 billion left over. So their nonplayer expenses must be at least $700 million more now than they were five years ago. That's an increase of 87.5 percent. 
Was inflation during the second Clinton administration that high?
Evidently, something doesn't add up. In previous assertions, to the public, to Congress, in labor negotiations and in court testimony, baseball has claimed that most clubs lost money every year since 1970. They made such claims sporadically from the 1880's through the 1960's.
In 1970 the two major league presidents predicted that, without the reserve system (which did end in 1976), "professional baseball would simply cease to exist" and "no intelligent person" would ever invest in it.
Yet none of the 30 teams operating today -- every one of which was bought by its present owners after that 1970 public declaration -- has ever gone out of business or failed to find a buyer when up for sale.
That includes two (the Cubs and the Braves) that go back 126 years, 14 others in business for at least 100 years, and expansion teams created 41, 40, 32, 25, 9 and 4 years ago. 
Wouldn't every American business, especially (but not only) small businesses, benefit from knowing how that can be done? 
Wouldn't America's international power, domestic economy and quality of life be improved if we all had access to such know-how? 
Wouldn't pure love of country impel them to spread the word? 
Remember, all these are the numbers they put out, none of which are being challenged here. Assuming their complete honesty and accuracy, this simply indicates that some other mechanism -- other than recorded profit -- must be involved in making survival possible. 
That's the mechanism they should let us in on.
Since all this has happened during the last 79 years under a unique and specific exemption from federal antitrust law, why was the present argument that the industry's economy "must be changed" offered in opposition to a bill that would take away their antitrust exemption?
If such losses developed with the exemption intact, what harm would come from abolishing it? 
What good has it done them to have it? 
Football, basketball and all other sports, operating within antitrust law, have become -- according to themselves -- profitable.
The problem, baseball says, is that the players are paid too much, and won't accept a salary cap. But football and basketball have negotiated salary caps under antitrust restraints, so what's the relevance? 
But if the baseball salary scale is too high, how do they manage to meet it and make it higher and higher every year? 
After all, players don't enter a club's office, point a gun and demand "your money or your life!" (Yes, we know; if Jack Benny were the owner, he'd say, "I'm thinking; I'm thinking!") Nor can players coerce a team into borrowing money. Only management makes all spending decisions.
Wouldn't many other employers want to know the secret of how to pay more than they take in -- and to keep doing it for decades at a time? 
National anthems, flags, "God Bless America" in the seventh-inning stretch, plugging charities and swearing allegiance are all well and good. But how about providing some practical help in times of stress? 
Isn't it baseball's obligation to spell out and disseminate the remarkable economic invention that, evidently, it alone has made? 
The sooner the better.

Six Months Later, It's the Little Recession That Couldn't

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
BEFORE Sept. 11, the United States economy seemed to hang on the precipice of recession without quite falling in. After the attacks, the first recession in 10 years became a reality, and the outlook turned far bleaker. 
 Business stopped for much of that week. The National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of business cycles, said in November that the downturn began last March but might not have become a recession without the attacks. Some forecasters, citing the technology bubble, high debt levels and nervous consumers, said the recession could be deep and long. 
 Six months later, the recession is looking like one of the mildest since World War II. Oddly, economists say, the very events that were supposed to aggravate the downturn instead unleashed a raft of responses from the government and the private sector that might have tamed it.
Congress approved $40 billion in new spending. The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate four times in the months after the attacks. Mortgage rates fell to the lowest level in more than 30 years, effectively giving billions in extra cash to consumers.
Businesses rapidly cut costs, improving their balance sheets and setting the stage for increases in investment. Carmakers effectively cut prices with inexpensive loans, allowing them to rid themselves of excess capacity and lifting consumer spending.
"Corporations and the Fed simultaneously capitulated to the fact that a recession had its grip on the U.S. economy," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist of Hoenig & Company, an investment firm, "and, paradoxically, set up the conditions for that recession to end."
The rapid employment losses -- almost a million jobs since the attacks -- have brought hardship for many. But with the unemployment rate still lower than it typically is at the end of a recession, wages have continued to rise. To the surprise of almost everyone, the economy even grew modestly in the final three months of 2001, a quarter that began only 20 days after Sept. 11.
There are sectors, like travel, and places, like the New York metropolitan area, that still suffer greatly. But other areas have started to bounce back. The local economies in Orlando, Fla., and Las Vegas, for example, were doing fairly well despite the drop in leisure air travel, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Economy.com, a forecasting firm in West Chester, Pa. The surge in auto sales helped to stimulate the industrial belt from Michigan to Tennessee, and the vibrant housing market, particularly in Florida and California, Mr. Zandi said, "hasn't skipped a beat."
But, he said, regional economies that depend on high technology and business travel -- Atlanta, Dallas, Denver, Phoenix, Portland -- "got hit harder than I thought."
Many industries have recovered, or at least have started to do so. In fact, last week, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said a recovery had already begun. 
Following is a selective look at the impact of the Sept. 11 attacks on the $10 trillion United States economy and in corporate America. DAVID LEONHARDT

Lifted by a WarBudget

BYLINE:  By JAMES DAO 

 BODY:
Before Sept. 11, the military industry was in the dumps. The Pentagon's procurement budget was tight, military stocks were plummeting, and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld was considering deep cuts. 
 What a difference war makes. Congress authorized $17.5 billion for emergency war costs, providing an immediate boost to companies like Boeing, which makes precision-guided munitions, and General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which produces the Predator, the unpiloted surveillance plane. 
 More important for the industry, President Bush has proposed increasing the military budget by $48 billion next year and $120 billion over five years, and Congress seems prepared to go along. 
The new money has kept once-endangered programs alive. These include the Crusader howitzer system, manufactured by the United Defense unit of the Carlyle Group, and the Joint Strike fighter by Lockheed Martin and the V-22 Osprey by Boeing and the Bell Helicopter unit of Textron. 
The president has also proposed sharply increasing research financing for laser weapons, space-based sensors and digital communications. And the urgent need for cargo planes and midair refueling tankers is certain to mean orders for Boeing C-17's and 767's. No wonder the Jane's Defense Weekly index of 20 military stocks is up about 25 percent since Sept. 11.

Airlines Are Humbled

BYLINE:  By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN 

 BODY:
Airlines, so imperiled that Congress passed a $15 billion bailout package soon after the attacks, started adding back flights and recalling some laid-off workers as early as December. But these are mere glints of light in a dark outlook. 
 Passenger traffic for the nine biggest airlines was down 13 percent in January, compared with January 2001, and revenue was off 27 percent. Those figures were big improvements over the 50 percent drop in traffic and 43 percent decline in revenue immediately after Sept. 11, but the industry's health is far worse than in any previous downturn. Cumulative losses last year reached $7 billion, even after the bailout. 
 The last low point, during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, was "trivial compared to this," said David A. Swierenga, the chief economist for the Air Transport Association, the industry's trade group. 
The airlines cut capacity 13 to 19 percentafter the attacks and parked or retired about 350 aircraft. But they also cut fares to fill seats. This year, the industry is expected to lose $2 billion to $4 billion, and some airlines may need federal loan guarantees. For consumers, that means more low fares. LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN

On the Road, Again?

BYLINE:  By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
With busy travel seasons approaching, Americans seem more willing to travel, though not necessarily on airplanes. According to a survey of travel confidence last month by the Travel Industry Association of America, 65 percent of Americans, by far the highest level since Sept. 11, plan at least one leisure trip in the next six months. 
 Other segments of the travel and leisure industry are expecting improvement but are cautious about predicting a major rebound. For 2001, the hotel industry reported occupancy rates at a 33-year low, but high-end urban hotels that depend on business travelers, as well as resort hotels tied to air travel, generally fared far worse than chains catering to road travelers. The difference was felt by the Walt Disney Company, which had a 16.9 percent drop in fourth-quarter revenue at its theme parks. 
 Over all, though, hotels are expected to be the first major travel segment to feel a rebound. PriceWaterhouseCoopers predicted an upturn in revenue by June. Increased travel may not help Amtrak, however. Although ridership rose on some routes after Sept. 11, the railroad's debts have worsened. It has threatened to scrap long-distance service if Congress doesn't provide $1.2 billion of aid.
Travel-related domestic spending fell 43 percent last year, to $520.7 billion. The industry association forecasts a 2.2 percent increase this year and an 8.2 percent increase in 2003, barring a catastrophe.

Loss and Gain for Insurers

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
 The attacks produced the heaviest losses ever for the insurance industry, estimated at about $50 billion. But they also proved to be a catalyst for business, and 2002 may be a boom year for insurers like the American International Group, the Chubb Group and the Hartford. 
Shocked by such large-scale terrorism, Americans have been trying to buy more of almost every kind of insurance, from coverage on their own lives to bigger policies to protect their businesses. 
 But the insurers have been just as shocked. They have tempered their own risk by cutting back on the coverage they sell. The combination of increased demand and reduced supply has sent prices soaring. Many businesses say the rise in premiums is making them settle for less coverage, but the price is often still two or three times what broader coverage cost before.

Handle With Extreme Care

BYLINE:  By ANTHONY DePALMA 

 BODY:
The anthrax scare has dissipated, but magazine publishers are no longer using cornstarch to keep freshly printed pages from sticking to each other. It looks too much like the kind of powder associated with anthrax. 
Now the publishers use a clear, odorless, silicon-based substitute.
 Generally, there has been little lingering effect on companies that depend on mail. The Direct Mail Marketing Association said the number of catalogs shipped has not declined. And no one has asked the Envelope Manufacturers Association to develop products that stand up better to irradiation. 
 Large media companies that were targets during the height of the anthrax scare continue to irradiate and decontaminate incoming mail; other companies pay for mail to be received and opened at remote sites.
Robert E. McLean, executive director of the Mailers Council, which represents companies that rely on the mail system, said most disruptions caused by the anthrax threat proved short-lived. "We've been hurt far more by the recession," he said.
The economic slowdown has also taken a toll on the United States Postal Service, which irradiates mail destined for government offices at great expense. Its mail volume is down 5 percent since September, and revenue is running $1.3 billion behind projections ANTHONY DePALMA

On Alert, Northand South

BYLINE:  By BERNARD SIMON 

 BODY:
The antiterrorist bunker mentality that transfixed the country was felt acutely along the United States borders with Canada and Mexico, where police constricted the multibillion-dollar flow of goods, disrupting trade, causing parts shortages and adding to costs. While backups are now largely gone, not everything is the same. 
 At the Ambassador Bridge and the tunnel linking Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, two busy crossings, American customs and immigration workers have been augmented by the National Guard and local police officers from southern Michigan, increasing the rate of inspections and spot checks. 
 At the four bridges from Mexico to Laredo, Tex., where more than 4,500 trucks enter daily, "we're still conducting increased examinations, and officers are working longer hours," said Rick Pauza, a Customs Office spokesman, "but the public understands why." BERNARD SIMON

HEADLINE: North Koreans Tour Asia And Europe Seeking Aid 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BROOKE 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 9 

 BODY:
Last week in Malaysia, North Korea's second highest leader toured an automobile factory and announced that he hoped that a joint venture would be formed to make Malaysia's Proton car in North Korea.
 Next week, the North Korean trade minister is to tour the Bank of England and the London stock exchange and to meet with British business executives who visited North Korea last fall. 
 As North Korea's relations with the United States, Japan and South Korea range from chilly to freezing, the impoverished Communist nation is cultivating Europe and Southeast Asia as alternatives for aid and foreign investment. 
"In the world of politics, the North Koreans have always maintained a diversified portfolio," Nicholas Eberstadt, a Korea expert at the American Enterprise Institute, said from Washington. "The U.S., Japan, South Korea are currently their weak stocks. So, now, they are looking for growth stocks -- the European Union, China, Southeast Asia, and possibly Russia."
With a $12 billion foreign debt and the per capita income of Honduras (about $750), North Korea looks to the outside world primarily for aid and, secondarily, for investment. After leaving a string of unpaid bills around the world, though, North Koreans are encountering caution on the current trips.
In Thailand, barter deals trading Thai rice and rubber for North Korean magnesium and machinery were proposed by Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra to the 30-member visiting North Korean delegation, headed by Kim Yong Nam, president of the North Korea's Supreme People's Assembly. To jump-start a deal to export 300,000 tons of rice to North Korea this year, North Korea promised to make a $6.5 million payment toward a longstanding $120 million rice debt it owes Thailand.
Despite credit problems, two-way trade between the two countries has nearly quadrupled over the last five years, hitting $130 million last year.
Moving on to Malaysia, Mr. Kim visited the national car factory and was briefed on Multimedia Super Corridor, a high technology company park. At the end of the car plant tour last Tuesday, a Malaysian official said, "Expectations are rising in Malaysia for establishing a joint car plant with the North."
Mr. Kim, who led trips last July to Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, told Thai and Malaysian officials that his government wanted to re-establish diplomatic ties with Myanmar, the last holdout in the Association of South East Asian Nations. Myanmar, formerly Burma, cut ties with North Korea in 1983 after its agents blew up a traditional bell tower which was crowded with visiting South Korean officials. The bomb killed 17 South Koreans and injured 14 others.
Over the last two years, almost all European Union nations have established diplomatic ties with North Korea. On a 10-day trip to Belgium, Italy, Sweden and Britain, the North Korean trade mission is finding it is competing with Afghanistan for European aid.
After donating $210 million in food and other aid to North Korea since 1995, last week the European Union issued a policy document that links aid to improvements in human rights and to steps toward market-based economic development. The European Union also announced plans to give $13 million in aid over the next three years, focused on improving North Korea's trading, transport, energy and food supply systems.

HEADLINE: Population Estimates Fall as Poor Women Assert Control 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 8 

 BODY:
For decades, experts assumed that the world's biggest developing nations, the home of hundreds of millions in big families, would push the global population to a precarious 10 billion people by the end of this century.
 Now, evidence is now coming in that women in rural villages and the teeming megacities of Brazil, Egypt, India and Mexico are unexpectedly proving those predictions wrong. Next week, demographers from around the world will meet here to reassess the outlook and possibly lower the estimate by about a billion people this century. 
 In India alone, by 2100 there may be 600 million fewer people than predicted.
The decline in birthrates in nations where poverty and illiteracy are still widespread defies almost all conventional wisdom. Planners once argued -- and some still do -- that falling birthrates can only follow improved living standards and more educational opportunities, not outrun them. It now seems that women are not waiting for that day. 
A few demographers are venturing to say that the trend may have little to do with government policies on family planning or foreign aid.
Since the United Nations conference on population and development in Cairo in 1994, women in many countries have said that if they had control over their reproductive lives, lower fertility rates would be a given. Women's health organizations now say that is happening.
"From Delhi to Rio, women's health advocates have stood fast against top-down population policies, and have stood for women's rights -- and abilities -- to make decisions about their bodies," said Cynthia Steele, vice president for programs at the International Women's Health Coalition in New York. "Whether they live in villages or high-rises, women have always known what's best for them and their families. Now we're seeing the results of their own choices to have fewer children."
Joseph Chamie, the director of the United Nations population division, said: "A woman in a village making a decision to have one or two or at most three children is a small decision in itself. But when these get compounded by millions and millions and millions of women in India and Brazil and Egypt, it has global consequences."
Mr. Chamie said it had been assumed that the fertility rates in big developing countries -- the number of births, on average, per woman -- would fall at best only to what is known as replacement level. That number is 2.1, or a little more than one child for each parent. But in big countries, even that pace would add a huge number to an already large population base before the trend eventually moderates.
Demographers may now be willing to go out on a limb and say that the fertility rates in the big developing countries may even drop below the replacement level, and sooner than most of them would have thought possible.
That would follow the trend already established in industrial countries, where the population slowdown has caused concerns about shrinking labor forces and aging populations.
Just as women are pushing for a larger role in economic life around the world, they are also apparently becoming more assertive within families. "We're breaking both the fertility floor and the glass ceiling," Mr. Chamie said.
In India, Gita Sen, professor of economics at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore, said in a telephone interview that there were important cultural factors at work.
"Fertility in India is declining and it is declining faster than many people had expected," she said. One reason, she said, is "that with increasing awareness on the part of women, they are being able to control their own fertility much better."
"It seems to start in one village and then spread to other places around that area," she said. "Attitudes are changing, and people are watching what their neighbors are doing."
With declining infant mortality, mothers become more confident that their babies will survive, Ms. Sen added, and so they can have fewer children. She and other experts say that urbanization also eases some family controls on women, and makes contraceptive pills or devices easier to find. 
Both family pressure and lack of access to reproductive health care limit many women.
Ms. Sen said a family survey in 1999 in India, where the fertility rate is still about 3.0 per woman, underlined the change in attitudes. "It was a very detailed survey that interviewed close to 90,000 married women all across the country," she said. "One of the most striking things in that was that even in the poorer northern states if you ask women about the number of children that they want, it's much lower than the number that they actually have."
In Brazil, women have reduced fertility levels without an official national family planning policy, Ana Maria Goldani of the department of sociology and Latin American studies at U.C.L.A. wrote in a paper for next week's conference. Brazil's fertility rate has tumbled, to 2.27 from 6.15 in the last half century, and it continues to fall for reasons that Ms. Goldani says are only now being analyzed.
Gelson Fonseca, Brazil's ambassador to the United Nations, said that television was important. Brazilians see small and apparently happy families in television programs and think about emulating that example.
In Bangladesh, family planning experts noticed a decade ago that in some of the remotest areas, information gleaned from satellite television was influencing contraceptive choices. In one case, a certain intrauterine device was rejected by many women in an area where one of them had seen it described as hazardous in a Western television program. 
There are 74 countries in what the United Nations calls the intermediate-level fertility group, with births between 2.1 and 5 per woman. 
This group includes very populous countries like Bangladesh, Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, the Philippines and Vietnam. 
Some demographers question whether any one trend will fit them all, and ask whether it may not be as mistaken to herald a general population decline to below replacement levels as it was to pronounce that the larger developing nations would never reach this stage. 
John C. Caldwell of the Australian National University urges caution. In a paper prepared for next week's meeting, he writes of a "loss of fervor" in the developing world for further fertility decline. 
Countries are not homogenous, he argued, and there are some large ones in Africa and Asia where there will continue to be a preference for more children.
But Ms. Sen says that she is not concerned about India backsliding in the movement toward ever-lower fertility rates, arguing that education and cultural factors are becoming catalysts for change.
"For a very long time we've had a huge problem in terms of 50 to 60 percent of the female population being illiterate," she said. "The most recent census, the 2001 census, shows the biggest increases in literacy happening in some of the poor northern states -- big jumps in literacy -- and that means girls going to school.
"Those same girls are going to be making the fertility decisions in another 10 years or so," she said, "and I don't think they are going to make them in the same way that their illiterate mothers may have."

HEADLINE: Staten Island Journal; 
Nice Lot. Just Get Rid of the Ornate Old House.

BYLINE:  By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
Mud Lane, a neighborhood in Staten Island, has the feel of another century. Dozens of rambling century-old houses line the narrow streets -- each unique and ornate. "They're gorgeous," said one neighborhood resident. "A beauty to behold."
 They are among the hundreds of historic houses on the island -- mostly clustered in six or seven neighborhoods. They vary from 18th-century Dutch farmhouses to turn-of-the-century Queen Annes. All are unique, some as ornamental as a Victorian valentine with their turrets and stained glass and filigreed carvings; others, stately and classic. 
 But in a few years, many may disappear. In the curious economics of development, most vintage houses in Mud Lane and the other six or seven historic districts in Staten Island are worth more demolished than standing.
The borough is growing so rapidly, and new housing is in such demand, that the property beneath the historic houses is worth more when it has been scraped bare.
Staten Island's population increased by 18 percent during the 1990's, making it the state's fastest-growing region. The demand for housing has long been high, but in the last three or four years, it has increased dramatically, said Robert Kelly, a Staten Island real estate salesman. Property prices have gone up by double digits every year, he said. "Vacant land is dwindling," he said. "Nearly all the good property has been taken."
Now developers are looking to the spacious lots of historic homes for more building space. Most are large enough to fit two smaller single-family houses, or three or four town houses. "Historic houses," said Mr. Kelly, "historic homes are worth more as dirt than as homes."
That kind of logic outrages Staten Island's preservationists, who have been pressuring the city since the early 1980's -- with little success -- to landmark vintage buildings and neighborhoods. In particular, they are trying to get landmark status for Mud Lane, Snug Harbor and a section of St. George. (An adjoining part of St. George is the borough's only district designated as a landmark.)
In other areas of the city, particularly Manhattan and Brooklyn, the idea that vintage buildings add beauty and depth to a neighborhood is widely held. Making a district a landmark tends to raise real estate values. And since Sept. 11, the appreciation seems to have grown.
But in Staten Island, 150-year-old houses can be knocked down with barely a stir, Mr. Bankoff said. "There's a culture of development there," he said.
Staten Island is a place of houses with yards. Today, a wide range of people raise their families in them.
"This was our dream," said Joyce Balldassarri, a police officer. She and Bob Pritchard, her husband, also a police officer, bought and restored a 130-year-old house in St. George.
But other owners of historic houses want to sell them to the highest bidder -- or at least to know that no law will prevent them from doing that when the time comes.
Robin Levin, an interior decorator, says her 19th-century house is not worth preserving. A neighbor of Mr. Goldfarb's, she said she opposed his efforts to landmark their neighborhood in St. George. "I bought the property for the location," she said. "If I can get a better price from a developer, I don't want anybody telling me I can't. It's my house. I want to do what I want with it."
James P. Molinaro, the borough president, said that residents opposed any curbs on development because owners of a building in a landmark district cannot change, renovate or demolish their property without the approval of the Landmarks Preservation Commission. When you landmark a district, he said, "you shortchange the owners $200,000, $300,000 when you keep them from pulling down houses. Sure, we should preserve the past. But not at the expense of homeowners. It's not fair."
But Mr. Goldfarb and the other Staten Islanders cringe when they see what development is doing to the borough's historical architecture. In the last year or two, at least a dozen historic houses in the Snug Harbor, Stapleton or Mud Lane neighborhoods have been bulldozed. On Prospect Avenue in Mud Lane, for instance, a developer built a row of identical new town houses on lots where several century-old homes once stood. The town houses, with their uniform garage doors, driveways and front windows, stand out incongruously in a neighborhood of century-old, individually designed Colonials and Victorians.
They say that they are neglected by the Landmarks Preservation Commission -- a charge that Sherida Paulsen, the commission's president, denies.
"It's not fair," said Mr. Jones, who moved from California in part to find an affordable historic house to live in. "We're just off the radar. Manhattan gets all the attention."
Even Mr. Kelly, the real estate developer, agreed that the loss of the grandly ornamented, 100- and 200-year-old houses was regrettable. "Those homes aren't being built anymore," he said. "It's too bad. But it has to be balanced against needs of the residents for housing."

 CORRECTION:
Because of editing errors, the Staten Island Journal article on Sunday, about historic houses threatened by development, omitted the given names and affiliations of three residents who supported the creation of historic districts. They are Simeon Bankoff, executive director of the nonprofit Historic Districts Council, and David Goldfarb and David Jones, board members of the Preservation League of America.

HEADLINE: Slim Edge Mars Vote by Swiss To Join U.N. 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 9 

 BODY:
Neutral Switzerland moved away from a fortress mentality by voting earlier this month to join the United Nations, but the narrow margin of victory appears to have hobbled any more such overtures for the near future.
 Despite a powerful, and rare, alliance among the government, business and trade unions in support of the measure, the enduring appeal of Swiss independence nearly sank it. While the "yes" column chalked up 54.6 percent of the vote, the measure only squeaked by the second crucial hurdle -- the majority of cantons -- under the country's direct democracy system. There, the tally was 12 cantons in favor to 11 against. 
 The exceptionally high voter turnout of nearly 58 percent overall, reversing trends in recent years, underlined the divisions between urban centers like Geneva and Zurich and the rural heartland areas. 
French speakers, as expected, lined up solidly behind the proposition. The German speakers in the country's east were more divided.
Those who supported the measure argued that it was time for Switzerland to abandon centuries of setting itself apart and to play a role in global power politics, even though the country could end up sending its soldiers to distant conflicts.
The federal government rushed to reassure those who opposed the move that Switzerland was not headed toward abandoning its sovereignty. "The government has given its word," President Kaspar Villiger said after the vote. "Joining the U.N. is not the first step toward joining the E.U.," he said, referring to the European Union. 
The pro-United Nations campaign was strongly supported by business leaders, including bankers, who have worried that continued aloofness would undermine Switzerland, a landlocked country whose prosperity largely depends on the outside world. 
At the same time, the country's banking secrecy is under increasing pressure from the United States and the European Union, both of which are determined to ferret out tax evaders who stash money in Swiss accounts. Just last week, the European Union stepped up the pressure, calling on Swiss officials to negotiate a deal that would lead to turning over private banking data on accounts held by non-Swiss citizens.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: AIRPORT SECURITY; 
AIR TRAVEL REVIVES AS FEAR RECEDES

BYLINE:  This article was reported by David Firestone, Micheline Maynard and Matthew L. Wald and was written by Mr. Firestone. 

DATELINE: KNOXVILLE, Tenn., March 6 

 BODY:
The new world of air travel begins even before passengers get inside McGhee Tyson Airport here in eastern Tennessee. Just to park in the short-term airport garage, drivers now have to open their trunks and consent to a full inspection of their cars. The body and bag searches come later.
 Nonetheless, to the amazement of the parking lot manager, there have been more than 2,000 cars every day in the garage for the last three weeks, almost a return to the 2,200 that were there on Sept. 10. Month by month, the airport is winning back most of those who deserted the skies after Sept. 11. 
 "For a while, we were down to 1,500 cars, but it's coming right back to where it used to be," said Brad Scheafnocker, the airport's director of parking services. "And people aren't so cranky anymore. Instead of venting on us, they offer to pop the trunk before they're asked. It's like people have just come to accept that this is the way it's going to be." 
Throughout the country, millions of people have overcome their fears and accepted once-unthinkable delays, inconveniences and privacy losses to travel by air -- the most directly felt tremor, for most Americans, of the terrorist attacks six months ago on Monday. 
Many in the industry say that for all the visible security measures -- National Guard members with their rifles, the painstaking searches for nail files -- aviation is not yet secure enough. They say that a terrorist with a bomb or knife could still evade the net, laying bare the industry's continued fragility and devastating the confidence among travelers that has returned month by month.
In fact, the security gaps that made the September attacks possible are proving much more difficult to close than had been initially hoped, government officials and safety experts say. Bags are still not matched to passengers on connecting flights. A terrorist could smuggle a ceramic knife past overwhelmed and undertrained security guards. 
But already there are signs that the national imperative to fly is so strong that people are accepting, and, in a sense, routing around their difficulties and fears.
In the last three months, low fares have won back more than half the travelers who stopped flying in September and October. Regional airports like McGhee Tyson or John Wayne Airport south of Los Angeles are returning to normal much more quickly than the big international hubs, in part because their security lines are so much shorter. Travelers are now used to getting up earlier for morning flights, wearing shoes without metal shanks and packing bags in anticipation of emptying them out.
This gulf of expectations, between increasingly confident passengers and nervous safety experts, emerged in interviews with travelers, airline executives and government officials who were asked to assess the state and experience of air travel six months after the events of Sept. 11.
Most agree that while the balance between vigilance and convenience has hardly been perfected. The gap has narrowed more than anyone predicted just a few months ago. Security delays are shrinking, even at the hubs, and many airlines are telling passengers they can now arrive 90 minutes before departure, rather than two hours. (Northwest Airlines cut the time to 75 minutes after adding 19 security lanes; United Airlines added 30 lanes and cut the time to an hour.) As troubled private security companies are gradually replaced with better-paid federal workers, the pledge of 10-minute checkpoint lines made so often by government and airline officials no longer seems so far-fetched.
"Traffic will come back stronger than people think," said Jonathan C. Orenstein, chief executive of the Mesa Air Group, whose company operates commuter flights under the America West and US Airways brands and flies as Mesa Airlines in New Mexico and Colorado. "Once people think it's sort of safe to go back in the water, you'll see some significant increases in travel."

Real Shield Is Distant
That soothing veneer of security, however, may be far thinner than many passengers imagine. While improvements are unquestionable, many regulators and industry officials say, the real goal of erecting an impenetrable shield against weapons and bombs remains distant.
Several times a month, it seems, an airport terminal has to be cleared because of an error: an unplugged magnetometer, a screener who lost track of a passenger. Capt. Stephen A. Luckey, chairman of the security panel at the Air Line Pilots Association, said that when he flew recently from his home in Montana, airport screeners missed his Swiss Army and hunting knives. They did find and confiscate his small scissors. 
Even the strongest airline boosters admit that almost no real progress has been made on bomb detection. No airports have enough technology to thoroughly examine many checked bags, and the recent program to match bags with passengers is effective only if one believes that terrorists are not suicidal. (Or that they have not noticed that bags are not matched to passengers on connecting flights.)
"We started on Sept. 11 at a 2," said Kevin P. Mitchell of the Business Travel Coalition, measuring security on a scale of 1 to 10. "We're probably at a 4 to 5, and it's probably going to take four or five years to get to an 8. We're safer than we were on 9/11, but we aren't safe enough."
The assessment is widely shared because the federal government, which has assumed responsibility for airline security, has so much yet to accomplish. The new Transportation Safety Administration set up by Congress to take over security from the airlines, has established rules on who may be a screener but has not actually hired any. It will probably start doing so in May, at which point it will have to hire them at the staggering rate of 5,000 per month -- with background checks and training required for each. 
Ideally those checks will weed out security guards like the two at Kennedy International Airport charged on Wednesday with trying to rob a Staples store on Long Island. The government has promised intensive testing and training of new screeners, a regimen that grew in importance after the agency acknowledged last year that it will not require them to have a high-school diploma. But many of the agency's critics say that even a promised increase in starting pay to $23,000 will not necessarily raise the quality of screeners.
"They're mostly going to be hiring the same people who were there before," said Michael Boyd, an outspoken aviation industry consultant based in Colorado. The government says it wants 40,000 screeners instead of the current 28,000, but some experts predict 60,000 screeners will eventually be necessary.
Even when the immense screening system is in place, supervised by well-paid federal overseers at every airport, it will only examine passengers and bags brought into the airplane cabin. Many in the industry say checked baggage poses the more serious threat. Congress wanted a system in place by February that would prevent a bag from being loaded without its owner on the plane. The new security agency complied, but only for the first leg of a flight.
The Congressional goal of a more reliable bomb-detection system for baggage by the end of the year by scanning every bag in giant imaging machines has been virtually written off. The Transportation Security Administration says it would take about 2,200 machines, and buying and installing that many would cost about $4.8 billion, assuming the two companies certified to build them could turn out that many.
The detectors are the size of a minivan and considerably heavier, and most airports will have to renovate buildings to install them.

Concern About Technology
"We are extremely concerned about the state of current explosive-detection technology," said William F. Marrison, president of the Metropolitan Knoxville Airport Authority, whose airport has already tested many next-generation detection devices. "Even if we knew what we were supposed to do with these devices, it would be difficult to have them ready in time for the December deadline. We just don't have room for them now."
The federal security agency acknowledges that the devices are too clunky and expensive to have them at every airport, so it has chosen for now to use some of those machines in combination with the machines used to swipe carry-ons and shoes for traces of explosives. But those are still months from being in place for checked bags.
"The problem here is that we have overpromised the American people what can be done," said James E. Hall, former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.
Passengers, however, often do not see the gaps that the industry insiders do. A tracking poll of 300 frequent fliers conducted by the Wirthlin organization found that in November, 57 percent were confident that airport security could stop terrorist bombs or weapons, while in January, 71 percent expressed such confidence. That optimism is also reflected in passenger traffic, which was off by 14 percent in January over the previous year, compared with 34 percent in September. 
David Swierenga, chief economist for the Air Transport Association, the airline trade group, said that the industry could return to pre-September levels by summer, assuming the economy keeps improving.
The passenger counts have been buoyed by extremely low fares. Business travel, which is less affected by fares, may have suffered a long-term blow, some airline executives say, after companies realized that some lost travel had not really been necessary. But beyond the discounts, many people in the field say that aviation is also benefiting from the nation's rallying, wartime mood, and the perception that the country has regained control of its destiny. 
"There's a distance now from the events of September," said David R. Conklin, the Knoxville airport's vice president for marketing. "People saw the Olympics pass without any incident, and the Super Bowl, and that carries over into the total perception that things are more under control now."
Having spent months making mental adjustments to their expectations, passengers no longer compare their airport experiences to the days before September. Instead, many are delighted that lines are shrinking somewhat and that the tension in the air seems to have diminished.
"I think people were more scared months ago, when passengers saw all the army and cops all outside around the corner when they pull into the airport terminal and get dropped off," said Jose Alvalle, a shuttle driver at MacArthur Airport in Islip, N.Y. "But the passengers I speak with them every day, they tell me they're more calm now, most of them."
Even repeated delays never imagined before September seem routine now. Rupert Jessop, a cable technician who lives in Colorado Springs, was singled out at the ticket counter at Denver International Airport last week to have his checked bag X-rayed. Whether the decision was random or not -- it has happened on each of the four flights he has taken since September -- Mr. Jessop says he has come to accept it.
"It just seems to be part of the security, the randomness," Mr. Jessop said. "It's required and it's better to be safe than sorry."
Of course, some airports still have long security lines at peak periods: two-hour lines at Kennedy, an hour at La Guardia and in Atlanta. But while many hub airports like Dallas-Fort Worth have reduced their average lines to 10 minutes at peak hours, many travelers have discovered that smaller, regional airports are often the most efficient.

More Money, Shorter Lines
While Los Angeles International Airport, for example, had more than 18 percent fewer passengers in January than in January 2001, the smaller John Wayne Airport, 35 miles south in Orange County, lost less than 3 percent of its passengers from that month last year. John Wayne's traffic in February was within 1 percent of last February's. Many travelers who might once have driven farther to a hub are now willing to spend a bit of extra money for shorter lines.
Deborah C. McElroy, president of the Regional Airline Association, confirmed that the shorter-haul regional airlines and airports are doing much better. Many commuter routes that were canceled after September have been restored, she said, often with jets that have improved the speed and efficiency of short-haul travel.
In many ways, in fact, the post-September slowdown clearly did make many airlines and airports more efficient. La Guardia, which had become seriously crowded last year, is now more manageable after several airlines eliminated less-popular flights. Major airlines bumped a lower percentage of passengers from flights last year than any year since records were first kept in 1974, according to the Transportation Department. 
At United Airlines last month, 86 percent of the company's planes arrived at their gates within 14 minutes of scheduled arrival, which was tied for the airline's best performance, according to United's senior vice president, Peter D. McDonald.
Those efficiencies are combining to lure more passengers into the air, which could cause the industry to return to its bloated ways. But airline executives also know that with just one slip at a checkpoint, one more hijacking or bomb, the frail recovery could collapse. If that happens, Ms. McElroy said, "the industry recognizes that it would be difficult, if not impossible, to recover."

HEADLINE: Sprawl-Weary Los Angeles Builds Up and In 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 9 

 BODY:
Look up the word sprawl in the dictionary, the joke goes, and there is the City of Angels and the dirty halo of dispiriting words it contributed to the urban lexicon: smog, suburban wasteland, Blade Runner.
 But look again. Ten years after riots ripped apart this city, Los Angeles is transforming itself in ways that defy the stereotype. 
 While the greater metropolitan area is still spreading out, especially 60 to 70 miles east toward the desert, the nation's second-biggest city is growing inward, upward, and making a fledgling attempt to free itself from the automobile. Last year, Los Angeles issued more building permits for housing inside the city -- more than 8,500 units -- than at any time in at least a decade. Most were for the kind of projects planners praise as the antithesis of sprawl. 
Downtown, almost 4,000 lofts are under construction or in development, giving fresh life to a moribund historic district. In the riot zones of South Central, hundreds of houses have risen on weed-choked lots. Throughout the city, parking lots are going down and more densely built apartments and commercial developments are going up.
A person can walk in Los Angeles, from home to work to curbside food vendor. Every day, nearly 250,000 people take the subway, the most expensive ever built in the nation. Even if the number of train riders is only a fraction of total commuters -- and a blip by New York or Chicago standards -- the volume has exceeded expectations by about 50 percent. 
What brought Angelenos to a point where an apartment near the old Farmers Market in the Fairfax neighborhood is more desirable than a tract house with a pool at the edge of the San Fernando Valley are the very forces that nearly made the city unlivable, planners and critics say.
Drivers in Los Angeles now spend an average of seven working days a year motionless in traffic, according to a study by the Texas Transportation Institute. At the same time, Los Angeles County -- the nation's most populous, with 10 million people -- has nearly run out of available land for housing developments. 
With six million cars, and no new freeways under construction, Los Angeles may have reached its tipping point.
"Congestion has gotten so bad that people are finally willing to trade space for proximity to work and play," said William Fulton, the author of "The Reluctant Metropolis" and head of a land-use think tank in Ventura, the Solimar Research Group. "Plus, sprawl is dependent on plenty of cheap land and middle-class families. For the most part, we don't have either of those anymore."
Of course, Southern California is a long way from the New Urbanist ideal. The 2000 census showed that 18 of the nation's 53 "boomburgs" are in the Los Angeles area. The term describes communities of 100,000 people or more that grew by at least 10 percent and are not the principal cities in their region. 
Moreover, people are still leaving the city because of its public schools and uneven services. Secession movements are afoot in Hollywood, the San Fernando Valley and the harbor area. All three communities could vote, as early as fall, on proposals to secede from Los Angeles.
But unlike old cities in the East like Cleveland, Detroit or Pittsburgh, where the core of the city was hollowed out by migration and never replaced, the oldest parts of Los Angeles are still growing. The last census showed that the city grew by about 6 percent, to 3.7 million. The central city -- basically downtown and the fringe -- grew by 21 percent.
Los Angeles, with 7,600 people per square mile, is nearly 3 times as dense as Houston, and 10 times as dense as Phoenix, by one census calculation.
"When I came here 10 years ago from New York, everyone said, 'Don't Manhattanize Los Angeles,' " said Con Howe, the director of the city planning department. "And there's still no great ground swell of support for high density. But it's happening through the market. People are making choices and we're a changed city because of it."
That change was encouraged by changes to city code and new transportation centers.
"We try to build in the city, along the new transit corridors, where somebody can get off a train or a bus after work and walk home," said Steve Olson, whose company specializes in building homes for first-time buyers.
Business, Mr. Olson said, has never been better, particularly among second-generation Latinos who want to buy a home but stay close to the neighborhoods where they grew up.
Los Angeles is fast becoming a majority-Latino city. And it is Latinos, along with Asians, who kept the core of the city growing while whites were fleeing to other Western cities, city officials and other experts say.
"The starter-home market for upwardly mobile Latinos is bottomless," Mr. Fulton, the author, said. "These are people who want a home with new countertops and a nice entertainment room, but they also want to be close to the old church and family."
When the city, in 1999, made it easier to convert historic buildings to lofts or apartments, a wave of building followed. Now, along Spring Street, Broadway and Main, the 1920's offices that were abandoned decades ago in favor of the glass towers that rose above downtown are being converted into homes.
The city no longer requires apartment or loft builders to provide parking spaces, making it easier, builders say, to create something resembling compact old cities. It costs less for the builder. 
The city has also used various incentives to get contractors to build houses in place of strip malls. Last year, 27 percent of new home permits were in these commercial areas, city officials say.
"I've never seen anything like what's going on now," said Jeff Lee, who has been building apartments, houses and lofts in the city for 18 years. "We're just about out of land, and yet people want to live in the city. The market is telling us that people want to go vertical."
Downtown, near the Staples Center, Mr. Lee is converting a 1930's truck-hauling building to apartments. At Playa Vista north of the airport near the ocean, where housing, offices and stores are under construction at the site where Howard Hughes built the Spruce Goose more than 50 years ago, Mr. Lee is building houses that sell for around $800,000. In South Central, he said, he has 175 houses under construction for sale at about $180,000.
Next week, the biggest new mixed-used urban project in years, called the Grove, will open in the Fairfax neighborhood, next to the Farmers Market, which dates to 1934. The development will have a trolley and walkways connecting the market to blocks of new stores.
While the retail area looks, in one sense, like a pastel-colored, outdoor version of the latest suburban mall, the project has generated a surprise just across Third Street. A village of 1,300 apartments and town houses is under construction on what used to be strip malls. The selling point of the new middle-income-priced apartments is a tenant's ability to walk to parks, stores, restaurants or work, and still mix it up with the sunbaked regulars at the old Farmers Market.
"It's not Disney," said Mr. Howe, the planning director, as he walked among a frenzy of construction workers at the Grove racing to finish by next weekend's opening. 
The good news for Los Angeles, Mr. Fulton said, is that the city is morphing into what he calls dense sprawl, with an ethnically diverse, lively inner city.
The bad news, he said, is that traffic and parking will only get worse, perhaps pushing more people to the subways and the already crowded buses.
"The big master-planned communities that Los Angeles is known for have moved to places like Phoenix and Las Vegas," Mr. Fulton said. "Here in L.A., our future is to be packed closer together. This is an amazing city. But this also means eternal traffic congestion."

The Mystery of the Disappearing Jobs

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton

 BODY:
WHERE did all the jobs go - and why? 
 That was the puzzle last week after the New York State Department of Labor revealed that 132,400 jobs vanished in New York City last year, many of them well before Sept. 11. The new job loss tally is one-third higher than the numbers crunchers had estimated as recently as January.
 Everyone knows about the Wall Street firms that had to flee after the attack on the trade center, and about the devastating effect the disaster had on small businesses in Lower Manhattan and hotels all over the city. 
 Far more obscure reasons for the increase can be found in the arcane byways of data collection, which is a science but sometimes seems more like alchemy.
 But a major reason has to do with a sad truth that, often, is easy to ignore: New York City is not immune to economic conditions in the rest of the country.
 Does that seem obvious? Well, there have been times (like the early 1990's) when the city seemed to be suffering its own private recession, even after the rest of the country recovered. More recently, the city's economy boomed along even as other areas suffered sharp increases in unemployment.
 The problem elsewhere was that companies had made way too much stuff. Too many computer chips. Too many coffee tables. Too many grommets and widgets and whatnots.
 New York City, of course, doesn't make much of anything but money (plus a shrinking number of garments and maybe a little whoopee). What the city provides are services, so much so that we can plot their geography: Wall Street brokerage firms; Madison Avenue ad agencies; Park Avenue law firms.
 Services have often been seen as far less volatile than manufacturing. And in fact, overall employment in service industries does not usually drop during recessions, though job growth slows considerably, according to William C. Goodman, an economist at the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. But combing through the data, he found that large classes of service jobs are, in fact, very much affected by recessions.
 One is a category the bureau calls engineering and management, which includes architects, accountants, and public relations firms. Another is called business services, which includes temporary help agencies, computer services, and advertising.
 You've probably already figured out what these services have in common: their customers are other businesses, not consumers. Which brings us back to New York City in 2001. "We're a service economy which sells services to be manufacturers," says James P. Brown, an analyst with the state labor department. "And manufacturing has been weak for a long time now."
 Eventually, that caught up to New York City. The biggest revision to the jobs data came in business services, which lost roughly 16,000 more jobs than the state had originally estimated. And the losses, which by year-end totaled almost 30,000, started in March, when the national recession officially kicked in.
 Why didn't all the economy mavens know this right away? Here comes the crunchy part.
 The jobs data comes from a survey of companies that is supposed to be representative of the whole economy. But it tends to miss new businesses, like, say, computer concerns. And when times get tough, filling out that survey "is one of the things that falls to the wayside," Mr. Brown said.
 But even tiny or troubled companies tend to file their tax returns, and the labor department uses companies' June payments to the unemployment insurance fund to perform a reality check on the survey. Sometimes the differences it finds are small.
 This time, they were big. The state found that it had undercounted the number of workers in the city in late 2000, and then overestimated them in early 2001.
 Given all this, why do services have the reputation of being stable? Maybe because at least one big service industry actually increases employment during recessions, Mr. Goodman found: health care.
 This is not, as you might think, because people get sicker when they are under economic stress. Rather, Mr. Goodman suggests, during boom times, workers avoid taking jobs in hospitals and nursing homes. During recessions, they have fewer options.
 The implication is that during recessions, high-paying service jobs vanish, he says, while "the gains are likely to be in lower-paying jobs."
 So you won't be surprised to learn that in New York City, health and social services jobs were just about the only categories that were growing in the recession year of 2001.

Amtrak: More Riders, And More Losses

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IN the dramatic endings to silent movies, the heroine was tied to the railroad tracks by the villain, with the audience wondering if the hero would arrive in time to save her. In real life these days, it is the oncoming train that is on the brink, waiting for a miraculous rescue.
 Amtrak is facing a December deadline, established five years ago, to make enough money to cover its operating expenses. It was making uncertain progress toward that goal before Sept. 11, but the terrorist attacks wrecked all previous plans. Now more people are riding the trains, especially the profitable ones in the Northeast Corridor, the Washington-New York-Boston stretch that is its most popular, so revenues are up, but expenses are up even more, so losses are reaching record levels. 
 Facing a loss of financing, Amtrak, which must give 180 days' notice before canceling long-distance trains, said it would do so on March 29, allowing it to shut down much of its operations outside the Northeast Corridor if Congress does not give it new funds for the federal fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. But Amtrak is still taking reservations for those trains and clearly hopes that it will receive the $1.2 billion it is asking for, plus a multiyear commitment for more.
The railroad argues it is doing well; ridership was up 4.5 percent in January from the same period a year earlier, to 1.76 million, and ticket revenues were up 12.4 percent, to $96.7 million. A major factor in the increased revenues was the Northeast Corridor, where the new Acela Express carries a premium price. Meanwhile, airlines' ridership and revenues are down, part of a recession in travel resulting from the weak economy and the aftermath of Sept. 11. In the Northeast Corridor, which accounts for two-thirds of Amtrak's ridership and revenues, business is up sharply, from 212,000 riders in September to 266,000 in December. The reason is new, faster and more comfortable equipment, and travelers' avoiding flying, either for safety reasons or because of security delays.
The improvement is clear in market share. From Washington to New York, Amtrak said it now carries 52 percent of the combined rail-air traffic, up from 42 percent a year and a half ago. From New York to Boston it carries 31 percent, up from 18 percent in mid-1999.
And its long-distance sleeper cars are often sold out, as business travelers on routes like New York to Chicago or Washington to Atlanta snap them up.
But according to Amtrak, the net effect of terrorism has been negative, with expenses for security more than eating up the increased revenue. 
Although it has lost money every year since it began in 1971, this year was supposed to be different. Five years ago, in the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act, Congress set Dec. 2, 2002, as a drop-dead date for Amtrak to break even on its operating costs. An Amtrak Reform Council was set up under the Act and has now drawn up plans for restructuring the railroad because of its failure to reach "operational self-sufficiency." The council called for peeling off the Northeast Corridor and having a new Amtrak management agency take bids from private operating companies, perhaps state agencies or freight railroads, to run long-distance trains elsewhere in the system, with more financial support from the states. Amtrak itself could bid against private entities.
One result would be to break existing labor contracts. Another would be to eliminate subsidies that some critics say flow among Amtrak's various activities, which include commuter rail services, profitable corridor trains and the long-distance trains. These ideas have drawn opposition from organized labor and rural interests.
Responding to the Reform Council's proposals for a breakup of Amtrak, the National Association of Railroad Passengers, an advocacy group, said in a statement, "the fundamental problem facing passenger rail today is that the federal government spends $13 billion a year on aviation, $33 billion on highways, and only about $570 million on passenger rail."
" 'Operational self-sufficiency' is not an appropriate 'life or death' target for passenger rail," said the group, which argues that relying on states for more subsidies is not realistic as state budgets slide into the red.
The Amtrak Reform Council, on the other hand, argued that the problem was not lack of support but Amtrak management. "All we're doing with our subsidies is subsidizing excessive costs," said Wendell Cox, one member of the council, at a meeting on Feb. 7 where its report was released.
Amtrak itself says the problem is that it is encouraged by Congress to run unprofitable trains, without commensurate resources. "The status quo has proved itself unsustainable," the railroad said in a report to Congress last month.
Amtrak is clearly near the end of its financial tether. Last year it mortgaged parts of Penn Station to raise $300 million. But the railroad and its supporters are hopeful that the changed atmosphere since the terrorist attacks may be good for Amtrak. As George Warrington, Amtrak's president, pointed out in the January issue of Arrive, the sleek magazine found on every seat of the new Acela Express, those attacks make a case for transportation diversity.
"The events of Sept. 11th demonstrated the need for a more balanced national transportation system," he wrote. "We expect to play a critical role in the nation's transportation infrastructure for years to come."

Saluting Five of the Island's High-Tech Pioneers

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
PETER GOLDSMITH acknowledged that he didn't know all that much about the life of Elmer Ambrose Sperry, but he had come to the Garden City Hotel to celebrate Sperry's life anyway. And he and 500 others did so in high style. 
 "To be honest, I can't tell you much about the man," said Mr. Goldsmith, the chairman of the gala's organizers and the president of the Long Island Technology Network. "The important thing," he continued as he greeted guests flowing into the ballroom for dinner, "was that he was important because he came to Long Island to build a technology business. People need to know that Long Island is still a good place to do that." 
 No one in the room was probably old enough to remember Mr. Sperry himself -- he began developing his gyroscopes, a sophisticated form of compass, in 1896. He died in 1930, after founding eight companies, most prominently Sperry Gyroscope in Lake Success.
It thrived by selling instrumentation and other engineered products to the United States military; in 1986, the Sperry Corporation merged with the Burroughs Corporation to form Unisys.
Today, most of the old aeronautics and engineering companies have similarly been swallowed up, have moved on to places where the cost of doing business in lower, or have mutated into quite different enterprises. In the process much history has been lost. To preserve some of what survives, and to buff the region's image as a place that is conducive to high-technology enterprise, a coalition of executives, association leaders and business-savvy academics had gathered in Garden City on Feb. 28 to induct Mr. Sperry into the new Long Island Technology Hall of Fame. 
Four other more recent innovators were also inducted: Leroy Grumman, who helped found the aeronautics company that became the Northrop Grumman Corporation; Charles B. Wang, a founder of Computer Associates, the software company; James D. Watson, who won a Nobel Prize in 1962 for his genetics research and who now heads the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory; and Jerome W. Swartz, a founder of Symbol Technologies, an innovator in bar-code scanning.
Before the evening's festivities began, guests and organizers spent a good part of the day taking part in technology seminars and discussions. Many of them congratulated each other on the turnout.
"We never expected this kind of crowd," said Arthur Rossoff, a consultant to Polytechnic University, one of the organizers. "Not in our wildest dreams."
Those who paid the $175 ticket price may well have expected a networking hat trick -- three Long Island legends, live on the same platform -- but they were destined for disappointment. While Dr. Swartz did receive the honor in person, Mr. Wang and Dr. Watson dispatched representatives. 
John C. Bierwirth, the former chairman of Grumman, now 83, made the most of the sports metaphors presented by the "Hall of Fame" name, jovially comparing its first members with Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio and Ty Cobb.
The day's organizers said that marble busts of the five men would be delivered this spring to the museum complex being developed at Mitchel Field, where they will be placed near the new Imax theater and the Cradle of Aviation Museum. The Long Island Museum of Science and Technology, another of the attractions on what is being called Museum Row at Mitchel Field, will be the curator for the Hall of Fame, which plans to name new inductees each year. 
Organizers hope that by positioning the Hall of Fame near the museums, they will tap an audience already interested in technology and science. Steve Barre, the president of the science museum, said that when it is fully operational, it will feature exhibits developed by local companies demonstrating the technologies underlying their businesses.
Throughout the evening, organizers sounded variations on the theme of recognition long delayed and finally achieved. "This Hall of Fame is long overdue," Yacov Shamash, the dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at the State University at Stony Brook, told the crowd.
In the journal given to attendees, Dean Shamash described Long Island as "arguably one of the country's original high-tech regions" that produced "groundbreaking discoveries long before Silicon Valley or the Research Triangle."
Herman Berliner, a provost at Hofstra University, which is not involved in the Hall of Fame, said he thought the project might raise awareness of Long Island around the country.
The project's organizers "are reaching out to high-tech executives and saying, 'We'd like to have you here,' " said Dr. Berliner, a former dean of Hofstra's School of Business and a former economics professor. 
"Nassau County in particular wants and needs to bring in new industry," he added. "Suffolk has already done much better" in building and attracting high-tech industries.
While Long Island has a rich history of engineering innovation, its companies need to do a better job of record keeping and preservation, said Gregory S. Hunter, a professor of business history and archive management at the C. W. Post Campus of Long Island University.
"Quite a number of companies around the country maintain archives, especially in Silicon Valley, but Long Island is not well represented in their ranks," Dr. Hunter said. "Outside of Grumman, there has been a lack of awareness among business leaders here that knowing what the company has been done in the past, and how it was done, could be of value in the future."
Dick Dunne, the director of public affairs for the Long Island operations of Northrop Grumman, said that while defense contractors and aerospace manufacturers no longer dominate the Long Island economy, it would be a mistake to presume their influence has disappeared. 
"I think it's good that once in a while we step back and look at where we came from and make comparisons to where we're going," said Mr. Dunne, who has worked for the company since 1959, when he was hired as a riveter at Grumman. "The influence of companies like Grumman hasn't simply gone away. At its peak this company employed over 24,000 people. That doesn't just fade away overnight."

HEADLINE: A New Era at Getty Marketing 

BYLINE:  By STUART MARKUS 

 BODY:
ON one hand, the acquisition just over a year ago of Getty Petroleum Marketing by Lukoil, the Russian oil giant, was a momentous event in the global economy: Getty was the first major American company to be taken over by the Russians, a milepost of the post-Soviet era.
 On the other hand, since the takeover it's been just another day at the office for most of the 200 or so Getty employees in Jericho. 
 Lukoil's $71 million purchase of Getty made international headlines. The company's new chief executive, Vadim Gluzman, and its president, Vincent DeLaurentis, were interviewed by the wire and financial news services and were featured in "all the major Russian newspapers," Mr. Gluzman said. 
Lukoil is Russia's largest oil company, with annual revenues of $13 billion. It was formed in 1991 by combining three refineries, one in Russia, one in Bulgaria and one in Romania. Its core strength is production, refining, shipping and other supply-related functions. The acquisition of the American company -- purely a distribution and retail operation, with about 1,300 gas stations in 13 Eastern states -- is part of Lukoil's global strategy to achieve full vertical integration, from wellhead to fuel tank.
As corporate takeovers go, this one has generally been employee-friendly: no wholesale layoffs or disruptions. At Getty's offices, the reaction appears to be low-key. Kathy Douglas, a receptionist, said: "As for the change, I'm not having any problem with it. It's been really good for me."
But one major change is about to occur. The company is spending $6.6 million on new headquarters, the former Snapple building at 1500 Hempstead Turnpike in East Meadow, a deal that closed Jan. 31. The move is scheduled the end of March.
Mr. DeLaurentis, the company's 51-year-old president, said there had been no layoffs at Getty because its strength, gasoline retailing, complemented Lukoil's drilling and refining operations, rather than duplicating them. In fact, the office has 12 more people now than it did a year ago. In addition to the 200 employees at the division's Long Island headquarters, 400 more work in regional sales offices and distribution terminals.
Revenues for the division, which sells about a billion gallons of gasoline a year, have oscillated with oil prices. Michael Hantman, the chief financial officer, said that profits for the first nine months of 2001, the latest figures available, were up 75 percent over the previous year, although he declined to give the actual numbers. 
Getty's new leadership is fully versed with American petroleum retailing. Mr. Gluzman, the 37-year-old chief executive, was born in Russia but has spent most of his professional life working for Lukoil in the United States as a chemical engineer and consultant. Sem Logovinsky, 51, the vice president for wholesale operations, is the only other Russian-born officer, but he was worked in the United States for two decades. He and Mr. Gluzman have both become American citizens. 
Mr. Logovinsky, who worked as an engineer and marketer for Amoco and Citgo, got to know Mr. DeLaurentis when Mr. DeLaurentis was at Sunoco before he joined Getty in 1997 as the president and chief operating officer. 
While Mr. DeLaurentis oversees day-to-day operations, Mr. Gluzman works on strategic development, regularly traveling between New York and Moscow.
Lukoil is more representative of resurgent Russian capitalism than of the old state-controlled Soviet stereotype, said Mr. DeLaurentis, who added that Mr. Gluzman may be more daring than his American counterparts. "It's actually a more adventurous philosophy," Mr. DeLaurentis said. "He has come in full of enthusiasm. He's much more energetic, much more open-minded, much more receptive to new ideas."
Getty Petroleum Marketing is now literally a world away from the oil company J. Paul Getty began building in the nineteen-teens. Texaco bought the Getty Oil Company in 1984, eight years after Mr. Getty's death, prompting an antitrust lawsuit by Pennzoil, a rival suitor. To settle the suit, Texaco sold the rights to the Getty name, along with a number of terminals and gas stations, to Leo Liebowitz, a Long Island entrepreneur who began with one gas station in 1955 and in 1970 started the Power Test chain.
In 1997, Mr. Liebowitz spun off the Getty marketing division into a separate company, retaining control of the Getty Realty Corporation, a Jericho company that owns most of Getty's stations and leases them to Getty Petroleum Marketing. 
Lukoil also operates about 1,000 filling stations in Europe and has deals in the works to buy more, along with some refining operations. The pace of these acquisitions has raised some concerns. Jay Bhutani, an analyst at Lehman Brothers in London, said the company's costs were rising without an improvement in cash flow. "This is a general problem in Russian industry," he said. "Basically, compared to their peers, they're doing a worse job. They're consistently lagging their peers."
Lukoil's stock, traded most heavily in the European markets, is hovering in the mid-$50-a-share range, off from its 52-week high of $62 but considerably above its 52-week low of $35.
Hina Ganeshan, an analyst at J. P. Morgan in London, believes the company may be spreading itself too thin. "They are trying to invest in everything," she said.
But in Jericho, it's mostly business as usual for Getty. "Essentially, really, we've remained as we were," said Mr. Hantman, the chief financial officer.

HEADLINE: The Brick Stood Up Before. But Now? 

BYLINE:  By DIANA B. HENRIQUES 

 BODY:
ONCE upon a time, three little pigs invested in Enron. The first built his portfolio from the flourishing golden straw of Enron stock, and beamed as it doubled and tripled in value. The second chose the unseasoned lumber of Enron bonds, pleased with the generous interest they paid. The third, preferring safety to high returns, took shelter behind double-walled brick: short-term Enron notes backed by collateral and guaranteed by both a bank credit line and an insurance policy.
 When the wolf arrived at Enron's door last fall, forcing that once-swaggering company into bankruptcy, Enron's stock incinerated like dry grass, and its bonds smoldered down to pennies on the dollar. Not even Enron's mighty bankers expect to retrieve all of the billions in unsecured loans they made to the shattered giant. 
 But according to credit analysts at Moody's Investors Service, the holders of those short-term Enron notes -- called asset-backed commercial paper -- have collected every penny of the $58 million they were owed. 
The tools that built that storm-proof shelter are known collectively on Wall Street as "structured finance." Over the last 30 years, Wall Street has used these techniques to create more than $5.2 trillion in asset-backed securities in the United States alone, with an additional $305 billion expected to be issued this year. International issues patterned on the American model are proliferating, especially in Europe.
Home mortgages, car loans, credit card debt, student loans, equipment leases -- all these assets, and more exotic ones like future receipts from British pubs and the box-office take for Steven Spielberg's future movies, have been remodeled into asset-backed securities. Those securities can now be found generating handsome returns for pension funds, mutual funds, banks, brokerage houses, insurance carriers, hedge funds and even some individual investors. A result, bond market experts say, has been the expansion of credit to consumers, greater liquidity and flexibility for lenders and the modulation of risk for corporations.
There's just one problem: The same financial tools used to create asset-backed securities were used to construct the elaborately camouflaged and booby-trapped partnerships that have been blamed for Enron's collapse. As a result, those tools are suddenly attracting the suspicious scrutiny of regulators, lawmakers, bankruptcy judges and investors. And that is making everyone in the profitable and well-paid world of structured finance very nervous.
"Enron gives a very useful tool a bad name for no reason," said Ronald Gilson, a law professor at both Stanford and Columbia. "Structured finance is used for a zillion different and worthwhile purposes. The problem is Enron used it to create a structure that was genuinely not transparent, to hide things."
His concern was echoed by David M. Eisenberg, a partner at the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and a pioneer in securitization, the process of creating asset-backed securities. "Any financing techniques can be abused," Mr. Eisenberg said. "Securitization is not special in that. But true securitization is about transferring risk to others -- and Enron only appeared to be doing that, when in reality they were retaining the risk themselves."
In an effort to distinguish asset-backed securities from the more Enronic uses of structured finance, the Bond Market Association, an industry group representing securities firms and banks, has been lobbying Congress and issuing white papers that defend the asset-backed securities market as "flexible and efficient financing that benefits everyone."
Moody's Investors Service, a bond-rating agency, is preparing a primer to help investors understand the garden-variety securities that make up the public market. One recent Morgan Stanley report on asset-backed securities, perfectly capturing the new battle cry, was simply titled "This Is Not Even Close to Enron."
But in fact, many of Enron's off-balance-sheet partnerships, on paper, are simply wildly complicated permutations of the basic structures involved in the creation of asset-backed securities: special-purpose entities, credit enhancements and contractual arrangements -- including interest-rate swaps and other derivatives -- that move assets, and the risks and rewards of owning them, from one entity to another.
Consequently, whatever courts, regulators, lawmakers, accountants and investors decide about the permissible uses of special-purpose entities could have far-reaching and unintended consequences for Wall Street's highly profitable structured-finance business. And that, in turn, will affect the companies that rely on structured finance to solve legitimate credit and cash-flow problems.
THE market's current suspicion about any corporate use of structured finance could hit hardest at companies already struggling with the weak economy, warned William C. Repko, managing director of the restructuring group at J. P. Morgan Chase, a leader in structured finance. "My nervousness is that we may have a perfectly fine company out there that can't satisfy the market's demand for disclosure and we'll have a liquidity crisis," he said.
Indeed, the earliest use of structured finance was to provide lifeboats for financially swamped Rust Belt companies like International Harvester and the financing arm of Chrysler. Mr. Repko, a bluff and genial raconteur, still has the yellowing paperwork for those 20-year-old deals. In each case, a special-purpose entity was created, legally distinct from the parent, to buy the troubled company's accounts receivable -- money it expected to receive from its customers -- and to borrow from banks, using those promised revenues as collateral.
In those prototypes, the special-purpose entity borrowed only from banks or other financial institutions. The more exotic deals, like most of Enron's, still do. But as investors and rating agencies became more comfortable with the technique, special-purpose entities were able to borrow by selling notes to public investors, offering them the safety of collateral and the comfort of dealing with entities less likely to be dragged into bankruptcy if a sponsoring parent got into trouble.
Today, the supply of such notes rivals the conventional corporate bond market. But the first step in creating each note was the birth of a special-purpose entity, a sort of talented box that can hold all kinds of assets and can borrow money, from banks or through the sale of securities, using those assets as collateral.
In "plain vanilla" deals, that is about as far as it goes -- a special-purpose entity, for example, buys a pool of car loans from the General Motors Acceptance Corporation, using money it got by selling public securities that are collateralized by those loans. Interest and principal payments on the car loans are used to make interest and principal payments on the asset-backed notes.
The same techniques work for student loans, credit card debt and, of course, home mortgages, which are the granddaddy of all asset-backed securities, although they are generally treated as a separate genre.
BUT it can become a lot more creative than that, said Jay H. Eisbruck, senior vice president for structured finance at Moody's. By the end of the 1990's, Wall Street's financial carpenters had created special-purpose entities whose securities were backed by almost any stream of future cash flow you can imagine, from court judgments to Medicare payments to music royalties to, yes, the bar tabs at British pubs and the future ticket sales for a diverse portfolio of DreamWorks movies. (The collateral for one such deal included the ticket sales for "Saving Private Ryan.")
Deals like that almost always require some sort of credit enhancements to assure investors that if the expected revenues fail to materialize -- because of a sudden outbreak of temperance in London, perhaps -- someone will make sure they are paid. A financial guarantee from a bank or insurance company is always appreciated, but investors will often simply accept a stack of collateral that greatly exceeds the face value on their notes.
Special-purpose vehicles are also central to the creation of synthetic leases, another product from the structured-finance carpentry shop that has been used by a host of companies -- including, unfortunately for its advocates, Enron. A special-purpose entity set up by Enron bought the company's headquarters building in Houston and leased it backed to the company.
Often, such special-purpose vehicles raise the money to buy the buildings by selling notes to outside investors, just as in traditional securitizations. Thanks to quirks in accounting rules and tax regulations, this arrangement allows the original corporate owner to remove mortgage debt from its balance sheet while still claiming a tax deduction for the interest on the debt.
When a special-purpose entity need not rely on public investors to raise money, however, the architecture can become baroque, with cantilevered extensions, balconies and breezeways that attach to other deals. And that is what happened at Enron.
Consider what is known in Enron circles as "the Sequoia deal," an arrangement that created a source of funds suspended somewhere between equity and debt.
It was based on a template devised a decade ago by Goldman Sachs, which called the securities involved Monthly Income Preferred Stock, or M.I.P.S. These once-novel but now widely used securities give issuers the tax benefits of debt but look like equity on their balance sheets. (Rating agencies and analysts are not fooled, said Brian M. Clarkson, senior managing director for structured finance at Moody's, and unlike some Enron deals, such arrangements are usually fully disclosed.)
Merrill Lynch followed with its own twist on M.I.P.S., and other investment banks developed their own refinements, adding a bell here or a whistle there. J. P. Morgan Chase customized it for Enron, expanding the floor plan to include no fewer than four interconnected special-purpose entities:
* At the hub was Sequoia, which bought accounts receivable from Enron and paid for them with money borrowed from the special entity next door, called Cherokee, through the private sale of some asset-backed notes.
* Cherokee, controlled by Enron through another entity called Cheyenne, got the money to lend to Sequoia by selling Cherokee common shares to Enron and selling those chameleon-like preferred shares to an adjacent independent entity called Choctaw.
* Choctaw was controlled by outside equity investors and financed by bank loans organized by Morgan.
Then, after the financial carpenters from Morgan had swept up the sawdust and left Houston, Enron expanded the deal on its own, adding another matching wing that stretches off the Sequoia hub, with the money raised through a fifth special-purpose entity called Zephyrus.
The resulting Sequoia structure resembles the original M.I.P.S. template about as much as the space shuttle resembles the Spirit of St. Louis. And it has had a few malfunctions under the stress of Enron's bankruptcy. J. P. Morgan Chase has had to sue Enron to get an accounting of the assets contained in Sequoia, which it argues are the property of the secured lenders.
(Unlike the owners of Enron's asset-backed debts, who will quickly get all their money back thanks to those bank lines of credit, secured lenders like banks and bond holders may wait years to find out how much, if anything, they will recover.)
MORGAN has also had to sue to force a group of insurance companies to honor the financial guarantees that the bank obtained to enhance the creditworthiness of another elaborate structured-financing deal it did for Enron, the oft-scrutinized Mahonia arrangements, whose fund-raising architecture included the use of various derivatives.
And, like all of Enron's lenders, Morgan now knows that its client used some structured-financing techniques to conceal billions of dollars of debt from lenders, investors and credit analysts.
"It would appear that none of Enron's service providers or bankers saw the entirety of what Enron was doing," said Bill Winters, co-head of the fixed-income and trading operation at J. P. Morgan Chase. "The entirety was known only to Enron."
The skepticism that was absent in Wall Street's earlier analysis of Enron's use of structured finance has returned with a vengeance and spread like a virus.
Accountants and those who write accounting standards have undertaken a wholesale review of how special-purpose entities should be disclosed to investors in audited financial statements. "This is something that is definitely going to be changed in the next year," said Paul K. Chaney, associate professor of management at Vanderbilt University.
A lot is riding on that change, said Martin Rosenblatt, a partner at Deloitte & Touche. The special entities used in most of the traditional forms of asset-backed securities -- those backed by mortgages, car loans and credit card debt -- will probably not be affected, he said. "But everything else that uses a special-purpose entity is up for reconsideration," he said.
The trick, he said, is to give information about the entities "without making it appear that the company has debts that it does not really owe or assets that it does not really own."
Aside from actual rule changes, Professor Chaney said, the Enron mess is likely to make outside auditors much more curious about the special-purpose entities they find. "Today, no company is too big to say no to," he said.
How Congress and regulators will react is still uncertain. After the scandal broke, legislators who are considering a bankruptcy-reform bill withdrew a proposal to give extra protection to the most common special-purpose entities. "That's one of the casualties of Enron," said Mr. Eisenberg, the securitization lawyer.
And lawmakers at Enron hearings have already criticized the M.I.P.S.-style preferred stock issues the company used, "although they have been blessed by the I.R.S. for a decade," one investment banker fumed.
Enron's own trip through bankruptcy is another source of uncertainty for structured finance. Court decisions tailored to the facts of one case can have broader repercussions -- as when, 18 months ago, a bankruptcy judge in the case of the LTV Corporation refused to recognize the claims of some special-purpose entities to which LTV had sold assets.
J. P. Morgan Chase has dug in on this front, trying to defend its rights under the numerous contracts drawn up to create the Mahonia and Sequoia transactions. "We thought we had hedged some of the risk, but as it turned out the insurance companies don't want to pay," said Mr. Winters at Morgan. "We've learned a valuable lesson from that."
Mr. Clarkson of Moody's agrees that credit analysts will be hyperalert to information about structured finance. But he cautioned that no amount of outside scrutiny can defend from deliberate obfuscation and fraud.
The most immediate threat to exotic forms of structured finance -- and certainly to the heavily camouflaged structures preferred by Enron -- may come from the marketplace. "The markets are a great carburetor," Mr. Winters said. "Companies that cannot tell a very convincing story about their exposure right now are being punished."
His colleague, Mr. Repko, expects a lot more disclosure about special-purpose entities in the financial statements that companies will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission over the next two months. "By virtue of the market's obvious distaste for these things, anyone who is halfway intelligent is going to be disclosing them," he said.
Indeed, the mere mention in the media that Krispy Kreme Doughnuts was planning to use a synthetic lease to finance a factory project caused such a backlash that the company swiftly abandoned the plan in favor of more traditional financing, Professor Chaney noted.
Most likely, after some initial nervousness, structured-financing deals that serve a clear economic purpose and that can be clearly explained will continue to be done. And deals that smack of earnings manipulation, debt concealment and self-dealing will get a lot more scrutiny.
"Most of the techniques that Enron used are legitimate tools that were totally abused," said Hans Stoll, who directs the Financial Markets Research Center at the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt.
BUT the "key to the safe" is disclosure, said Professor Gilson, an opinion echoed by many.
Companies that want to use complicated structured-financing techniques should be prepared to explain them completely, he said. And in plain English, please -- if only to demonstrate that the board of directors and chief executive understand the deals themselves. (Don't even try to persuade anyone that a structured-finance deal involving a closely related party -- the company's chief financial officer, for example -- is a good idea, he added.)
But it would be a shame, he said, if the tools of structured finance came to be seen as the equivalent of skeleton keys and safe-cracking implements. Like electric jigsaws and battery-powered screwdrivers, they can be used to create shelter from hardships, safe exits from risky places, room to grow and a stable foundation. But like all tools, he said, they are only safe if used at arm's length in the daylight.

GRAPHIC: Drawing (Gary Hallgren)(pg. 1) Chart: "Tools From Wall Street's Workbench . . ."Structured finance is used by companies to raise cash and reduce risk. In the form it most frequently takes, structured finance allows a company to sell an asset to a special-purpose entity created to buy it, thereby spreading the risks associated with the asset among the investors who finance the entity. 1. A company sells financial assets to an entity created by the company to buy them. 2. The entity is financed by investors who buy debt securities issued by the entity and backed by the assets bought from the company. . . . Built the Labyrinth That Was EnronUsing similar structured finance tools, Enron created elaborate arrangements for selling assets and raising cash. Here is one example, the Marlin Water Trust I, set up to purchase Azurix, a water and waste treatment company, from Enron. 1. Enron lent stock to a wholly owned trust. 2. The stock was used as collateral for a partnership called Marlin Water Trust I. 3. Enron created a subsidiary, called Bristol Water Trust, to manage Azurix, the water company, and later borrowed cash from Bristol. 4. Bristol pledged its future debt payments from Enron to Marlin. 5. Marlin raised money from investors. 6. Pledging its cash flow from Bristol, Marlin issued debt. 7. Enron, through Bristol, swapped Azurix for 33 percent of Atlantic Water Trust. 8. With the money it received from investors, Marlin I bought 67 percent of the Atlantic Water Trust -- the new owner of Azurix. 9. Some of the money invested in Atlantic by Marlin flowed through Bristol to Enron as a loan. (pg. 10)

Wall Street Moves On

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
While there has been little long-term effect on securities trading, the attacks have scattered several of Wall Street's biggest firms -- some for good. The relocations come amid a profit slump that will likely mean another round of job cuts on top of the tens of thousands of layoffs that brokerage firms and investment banks made last year. 
 Wall Street firms have also been devising new ways to send orders to the New York Stock Exchange, with some switching from phone lines to high-speed Internet connections. And the exchange has improved its disaster plan, ready to shift trading to an undisclosed site within a day. 
 Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which had planned to shift some divisions out of its headquarters on Times Square into a new building two blocks away, decided to buy Texaco's former headquarters in Westchester County as backup. It may move some trading operations there.
Even the Goldman Sachs Group, a champion of the financial district campus concept, has decided to move its stock trading and research to Jersey City in a few years. Then Goldman would be able to retreat to a trading floor outside Manhattan if there were another disaster. Lehman Brothers Holdings, which had been based downtown, paid about $750 million for Morgan Stanley's new building and moved there last month.
Several firms, including Merrill Lynch and Lehman, are taking multimillion-dollar charges to cover the effects of the attack. PATRICK McGEEHAN

HEADLINE: COVER STORY; 
Looking for the Humanity Beneath Those Outbursts

BYLINE:  By RICHARD SANDOMIR 

 BODY:
BOBBY KNIGHT is one of the greatest college basketball coaches ever, the winner of three national championships before he was dismissed in 2000 by Indiana University. Yet that success competes with another side of the man called the General: the bullying, out-of-control and profane man who was arrested for assaulting a policeman in Puerto Rico when he was coaching in an inter-national tournament, who threw a chair across the court during a game against Purdue and who was videotaped briefly choking a player during practice.
 Mr. Knight cannot escape that rich, headline-making, a volatile history; his career is etched on sports fans' personal memory chips. Even now, in his new job as the coach of Texas Tech's basketball team, people await his inevitable success -- and his first conflagration. 
 In 1986, "A Season on the Brink," John Feinstein's chronicle of Indiana's 1985-86 season, became one of the best-selling sports books of all time. Tonight, a movie version of the book, and ESPN's first dramatic production, will have its premiere. 
 Playing Mr. Knight is Brian Dennehy, best known for his Tony Award-winning portrayal of the downtrodden Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman."
 "The good news is he's a wonderful character. The bad new is everybody knows who he is," Mr. Dennehy said. "It's not like playing Hamlet, dead for 500 years. He's very much alive."
 Mr. Dennehy plays Mr. Knight as a volcano, screaming and taunting his players, motivating them as if they were Army recruits who must be brow-beaten and stripped of civilian habits, then rebuilt as Knight's men. He vividly shows Mr. Knight's hatred of losing, and the pain that comes with it. The verbal eruptions overwhelm his moments of regret and the quiet, fatherly scenes with his son Patrick. "A lot of people who will watch this are ESPN viewers, as I am, who may be expecting to see someone pretend to be Bobby Knight, which I don't," Mr. Dennehy said. "That may be a negative for some people. He is one of those people for whom the word inimitable was created. It's a question of interpretation. There will be some sports purists who will not like it, but it's based on a book that was very successful, and we essentially took everything from the book."
 The film also uses a device in which people speak about Mr. Knight. Some really know him; others are actors. As one real-life Knight partisan said, "I don't necessarily like his language, but take that away, there isn't a finer man today in the United States." In one vignette, Mr. Dennehy, as Mr. Knight, looks into the camera and says: "They come here because they want to learn to become men. Who the hell do you think better prepares them for that? Some dork in the chemistry department -- or me?"
 Mr. Dennehy, who is 63, is nearly 20 years old than Mr. Knight was during the period covered in the film. His hair is white, not the gray of Mr. Knight in those years. He jokes that he is too heavy now, even after losing 30 pounds for the role, to look right wearing the red sweaters that were Mr. Knight's trademark at Indiana.
 "I look like Santa Claus on a summer vacation," he said. "I'm too old and too fat for it."
 Mr. Dennehy came to the role with some sympathy for Mr. Knight. He recognizes Mr. Knight as a superlative teacher and as a successful coach who built Indiana into a program that enriched the university financially.
 "With everything, I like the guy," he said. "He has the guts to say what he wants to, to be defiant and be controversial. Everybody figures the politically correct way to go, but he is what he is and stands up for it. God knows he's been his worst enemy."
 Mr. Dennehy recalled playing offensive and defensive tackle as a freshman at Chaminade High School in Mineola, N.Y., with a coach who bore a similarity to Mr. Knight. "He was a former New York City detective, maybe 5-10, 180 pounds," he said, "a tough guy who would whack you around and beat you up."
 There will be two versions of "A Season on the Brink," both shown at 8 tonight: on ESPN, in which Mr. Knight's crude language is kept intact, the other on ESPN2, in which the obscenities will be bleeped out (though it will not be hard to discern what he is saying).
 "I was obviously concerned about the language," said the writer, David W. Rintels. "I thought you couldn't do the film without the language. The bleeping is fine. And there's a whole lot of bleeping going on."
 One scene, taken verbatim from a locker room rant by Mr. Knight after his Hoosier team lost to the University of Iowa, "goes beyond profanity into something else," Mr. Rintels said.
 Mr. Dennehy said: "If you listen to the tape or read the transcript, you see that even though he is barely in control, literally foaming, he is completely rational. Each phrase connects to the next; he's not just fulminating. It has a real rationale. I worked on it for weeks."
 For Mr. Rintels, writing "Season" was a change of pace. Most recently, he wrote the script for TNT's "Nuremberg" mini-series, about the postwar Nazi trials. He first met Mr. Dennehy when he wrote and produced "Day One" for CBS, in which the actor played Gen. Leslie R. Groves, commander of the Manhattan Project.
 Mr. Rintels said that he had turned down an offer to write a screenplay for a four-hour film on ESPN about the massacre of Israelis at the 1972 Summer Olympics, but heard through his agent the network was planning the Knight movie. "I chased 'Season,' " Mr. Rintels said. "I'm a sports fan and I thought Knight's complexity and the dramatic situations he found himself in were the stuff of good drama. Feinstein's book had drama built into it. It's not the conventional sports movie in any respect. It doesn't have a happy ending or the unqualified hero meeting familiar obstacles."

Anthrax and Anxiety

BYLINE:  By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
The anthrax scare in October sent tens of thousands of people rushing to their doctors for Cipro, causing a nationwide shortage and fear that there were not enough powerful antibiotics. Many people began to criticize Bayer, the maker of Cipro, and other drug companies, saying they tried to profit in a crisis. 
But the frenzy did not last.
 Cipro prescriptions rose by 27 percent from September to October, according to NDCHealth, a health care information company. By November, however, prescriptions had fallen to below what doctors had been writing before the anthrax threat. 
 The Sept. 11 attacks also appear to have moved people to ask their doctors for prescriptions of antidepressants like Paxil, made by GlaxoSmithKline, Zoloft by Pfizer and Prozac by Eli Lilly. The annual growth rate for antidepressant prescriptions reached almost 18 percent in December, up from 13 percent in August. Some of that may have come from the recent availability of a lower-priced, generic Prozac sold by Barr Laboratories and others.
Terrorism also raised the profiles and fortunes of two small vaccine companies -- Acambis of Cambridge, Mass., and BioPort of Lansing, Mich. In late November, Acambis and its partner, Baxter International, won a $428 million contract with the federal government to make 155 million doses of smallpox vaccine. Since Sept. 11, the company's stock has risen about 150 percent. Hundreds of people have called BioPort, asking how to buy its anthrax vaccine. It said it hoped to sell the vaccine to the public once it fulfills a contract to make the vaccine for soldiers. MELODY PETERSEN

Finding Pockets of Resistance to Economic Optimism

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
ROBERT J. BARBERA, chief economist at Hoenig & Company, says he will leave it to "economic theologians" to decide how to describe the recent economic downturn.
 By some definitions, the country may not have suffered a recession at all. But that is not a reason to wear only rose-colored glasses. The commercial paper market is emitting signals of continued concern, and many of the nation's top corporate executives are still glum. 
 The rule-of-thumb definition of a recession is at least two quarters of economic declines. The first was the third quarter of 2001. The second was expected to be the fourth quarter.
Now it seems that the economy grew in the fourth quarter -- not by the meager 0.2 percent initially reported, but by a surprising 1.4 percent. In addition, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index showed growth in February, the first positive sign in 19 months. The institute's index for the service sector had its biggest increase in 15 months. To top it off, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said Thursday that the economic recovery was "already well under way."
On the back of this positive news, the stock market has rallied. The Dow Jones industrial average is now up 5.5 percent for the year, the Standard & Poor's 500 index is up 1.4 percent and the Nasdaq composite index is off by only 1.1 percent. Just two weeks ago, all three indexes were down for the year, with the S.& P. off 5.1 percent and Nasdaq down 11.6 percent. The bond market is also signaling a nice recovery with a rise in interest rates. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note finished the week at 5.23 percent, up from 4.83 percent two weeks ago. The yield on Friday was the highest since last July.
So worrying about interest-rate spreads in the commercial paper market might seem uncalled for, even if they reflect an undercurrent of investor concern.
The commercial paper market, where companies borrow for short periods, is not on the radar screen of many investors. Money market funds, where many investors flee for safety in tough times, invest in commercial paper. More pertinent is that the interest rates paid in this market can be a signal of broader credit concerns.
The current spread between rates paid on the highest-rated commercial paper and those for the second tier shows that there is concern about the outlook. For 30-day commercial paper, the spread is now 40 basis points, or four-tenths of a percentage point. The five-year average is 30 basis points, according to Standard & Poor's.
One driver of this wider-than-normal spread is the fallout from the Enron scandal. Diane Vazza, head of global fixed-income research at S.& P., said two worries were complex corporate structures and questionable accounting practices.
She said that with the economy starting to recover, one would expect to see the spread start to tighten. But "as long as that stuff is still out there, the spread will stay wider," she said.
At the recent meeting of the Business Council in Boca Raton, Fla., three-quarters of the 75 chief executives surveyed said they thought the economy was still in recession. About half of them said they thought the downturn could last until July.
Because they are not as optimistic as the recent data or Mr. Greenspan, it is unlikely that they will quickly resume investing in plants and equipment, which the economy needs to keep up a healthy rebound in the second half of the year.
Many of these executives also do not think that they can raise prices without losing market share -- meaning that increasing their earnings will not be easy. So there are not big incentives for them to invest and expand right away.
But the surprising report on Thursday that worker productivity grew 5.2 percent in the fourth quarter and that unit labor costs actually declined may bring a ray of hope. Increased productivity and lower costs are a path to better profits, something that should get executives thinking more positively again.

HEADLINE: Oil Industry Hesitates Over Moving Into Arctic Refuge 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 9 

 BODY:
More than three decades ago, the world's largest energy companies led the charge to drill for oil on the North Slope of Alaska. But now, as the debate rages over opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration, those same companies remain surprisingly silent.
 Drilling in the Arctic refuge, which has already been approved by the House, has become a touchstone issue for the Bush administration, and the issue promises to produce a nasty fight in the current debate over the energy bill in the Senate. 
 Publicly, the biggest multinational petroleum companies, like Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch/Shell, BP and ChevronTexaco, back the Bush administration's assertion that developing the oil in the Arctic refuge is critical to the American economy. But privately, many large companies say the prospect, solely on business terms, is not terribly attractive. 
"Big oil companies go where there are substantial fields and where they can produce oil economically," said Ronald W. Chappell, a spokesman for BP Alaska, which officially supports opening the area to drilling. Using the acronym for the refuge, he continued, "Does ANWR have that? Who knows?"
Oil companies and industry experts say it is cheaper and more promising right now to exploit large reservoirs of oil elsewhere in the world. And it is easier: many companies fear that drilling in the wilderness area may be blocked by persistent litigation, or that a future president or Congress could put the refuge out of bounds once more.
"There is still a fair amount of exploration risk here: you could go through eight years of litigation, a good amount of investment, and still come up with dry holes or uneconomic discoveries," said Gerald J. Kepes, the managing director for exploration and production issues at the Petroleum Finance Company, a Washington consulting firm for oil companies. "It's not clear that this is quite the bonanza some have said."
Supporters and opponents alike of drilling in the Arctic refuge have noted the reticence of the largest multinational oil conglomerates on the issue. "They are not present at all," a Senate aide said.
Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, said that the administration believed that oil companies would be interested in exploration if the refuge is opened to drilling. "What's important is that we have this option due to the vast potential to reduce our reliance on foreign sources of energy," she said.
The fight over oil drilling in the refuge has flared in Congress every few years, and so far, opponents of drilling have kept the area off limits. Now, proponents of drilling smell the sharpest whiff of victory ever.
They still face an uphill battle. The energy bill narrowly passed last year by the House includes a passage permitting oil exploration in the refuge. But in the Senate, two Democrats, John Kerry of Massachusetts and Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, have threatened to filibuster any amendment on drilling, meaning that proponents will have to muster at least 60 members to force a vote. Given the deepness of the divisions, the entire energy bill could unravel if both sides tug hard enough at this single issue, Congressional aides and energy industry executives said.
The battle centers on drilling on the coastal plain of the refuge, a narrow ribbon of land that stretches about 110 miles along the Beaufort Sea. Environmentalists and wildlife biologists say that in the summer, the coastal plain teems with caribou and millions of migratory birds. Drilling for oil there, they argue, would ruin one of the few pristine wilderness areas left on the planet.
Those who back drilling are varied and formidable, including a bipartisan array of politicians from southern and western states, nearly the entire political establishment of Alaska and several labor unions, led by the Teamsters. They contend that the coastal plain is a snowbound wasteland, and the oil there could be developed with little environmental damage. They say the coastal plain's reservoirs hold about 16 billion barrels of oil, or enough to meet the country's appetite for petroleum for a little more than two years.
The oil companies themselves, however, are less certain of how much oil lies below the coastal plain. No precise data about the amount of oil in the plain is publicly available. In the 1980's, BP and what then was the Chevron Corporation drilled an exploratory well on private land owned by native tribes that is inside the refuge, but BP said that those results were a proprietary secret. The United States Geological Survey estimates that at oil prices around $20 a barrel, the amount of oil that could be recovered economically from the federally controlled part of the coastal plain is 3.2 billion barrels.
Of course, companies face severe difficulties in developing oil fields overseas, from the rough winters in the North Sea to the endemic corruption in Nigeria to the long-running civil war in Angola. But the size of the discoveries and the relative cheapness of exploiting them often make the investments worthwhile. Within each oil company, prospects in the Arctic refuge would be measured against fields elsewhere. A political mandate to explore the region, executives of several major oil companies said, would not necessarily compel them to rush into the area.
"All our Alaska projects need to compete worldwide with other Phillips projects," said Dawn Patience, a spokeswoman in Alaska for Phillips Petroleum, the largest oil producer on the North Slope. "And it does come down to economics."
The calculus includes the usual factors like the cost of producing oil and shipping it to market. But drilling in the Arctic refuge holds significant political risks that would lead to delays and with that, higher costs, oil company officials said.
"There will be tremendous debate or delays due to litigation," an executive with a major oil company said. "All that has to go into the assessment of whether that project would be economically viable."
Still, there would be pressure on companies already working in Alaska, like BP, Exxon Mobil and Phillips, to bid for leases if the area is opened to drilling. The state, which issues so many of the permits oil companies need to work in Alaska, might take their indifference as a slap in the face, said environmentalists and some industry executives.
At the same time, smaller companies, particularly those looking for a foothold in Alaska, might be willing to take on the risks and aggressively pursue drilling in the refuge. "Smaller companies are involved in fewer places, and what is a marginal opportunity for us is a big opportunity for an independent," the executive with the major oil company said. "This is not a huge priority for us."
Even without lawsuits by environmentalists, the earliest any oil from the wildlife refuge would make it to market is 2010, industry executives said. But development efforts could drag out well beyond that date. "To protect the refuge," said Deborah Williams, executive director of the Alaska Conservation Foundation in Anchorage, "national environmental law firms and Alaskan environmental groups will find every opportunity to challenge drilling."
Oil companies know too well how projects can atrophy within a web of litigation and political resistance. They hold hundreds of leases for places where they cannot drill because of litigation, Congressional action or a change of presidential administration. Among them are Bristol Bay in Alaska, the western and eastern seaboards of the United States and the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
The champions of drilling in the refuge are the State of Alaska and the unions. In fiscal 2001, 82 percent of the unrestricted funds in the state budget came from the petroleum industry, which is also a major employer. But oil production on the North Slope has fallen by half since its peak of two million barrels a day in 1988, said Mark D. Myers, director of the State Division of Oil and Gas.
And as oil production dwindles, so might revenues and jobs. "The primary reason is job creation," said Jerry Hood, a Teamsters union energy specialist. The Bush energy policy, Mr. Hood said, "is, frankly, a way to re-employ American workers."

'A Matter of Elimination': Bringing Books to the Screen

BYLINE:  By Jamie Malanowski 

 BODY:
What does it take to turn a book into an Oscar-winning screenplay? The New York Times invited five writers who have won the Academy Award for best adapted screenplay to discuss their experiences. They were:
 Michael Blake, who won for "Dances With Wolves" (1990), which he adapted from his own novel about a Civil War soldier more in sync with the Sioux than with the Army. 
 Ted Tally, who won for "The Silence of the Lambs" (1991), which he adapted from Thomas Harris's novel about an F.B.I. agent, Clarice Starling, trying to crack a string of murders with help from a criminal psychopath, Hannibal Lecter.
Steven Zaillian, who won for "Schindler's List" (1993), which he adapted from Thomas Keneally's fact-based novel about a hero of the Holocaust. 
Eric Roth, who won for "Forrest Gump" (1994), which he adapted from Winston Groom's novel depicting the rising fortunes of a foolish Southerner.
Bill Condon, who won for "Gods and Monsters" (1998), which he adapted from Christopher Bram's novel "Father of Frankenstein," about the director James Whale.
Jamie Malanowski, a New York-based freelance writer who specializes in entertainment, interviewed them separately. Here are excerpts from their responses.

JAMIE MALANOWSKI How did you get involved with the project?
MICHAEL BLAKE I wrote "Dances With Wolves" while I was a reporter for The Los Angeles Free Press. No one was interested in making it into a movie. But I knew Kevin Costner from back when we were both getting started and he was a stagehand, so I sent it to him, and finally he read it and asked me to write a screenplay. Even then, nobody in Hollywood was interested.
STEVEN ZAILLIAN Actually, I had read the reviews of "Schindler's List" and had bought it for a friend, though I never read it myself. Several years later, in the mid-80's, I got a call from Martin Scorsese, asking me to do a draft. I read it, and loved it, and did a couple drafts for him.
ERIC ROTH: I had worked with the producer Wendy Finerman and she gave me "Forrest Gump." It had sat for eight or nine years at Warner Brothers, and now it was going to Paramount. She told me other people had taken a shot at it and hadn't succeeded, but Tom Hanks said if I could pull off a screenplay, he'd be interested. So Tom and I went to Paramount and pitched the story. I would describe the story, and whenever I would get stuck, Tom would start to act it out. And we got the go-ahead.
TED TALLY I knew Tom Harris a little because he was a client of an art gallery where my wife worked, and out of the blue he sent me galleys of "The Silence of the Lambs." I thought it was extraordinary, one of those books, like "The Godfather," that come along once every 10 years -- smart enough to impress the critics and exciting enough to reach a big audience. I thought it would make a great movie. But I was an obscure playwright and an unproduced screenwriter -- I never thought the assignment would be open to me. Orion had bought the rights to the book for Gene Hackman, who at that point thought he might direct, write the screenplay and star in the movie. I flew to see him at his home in Mexico, and I went to see him on the set of a film in Chicago, and eventually I got the assignment. As it happened, Gene left before I finished the first draft. There was a lot of controversy about a film he was in called "Mississippi Burning," and I guess he was reluctant to do another dark, violent movie.
BILL CONDON I had always loved James Whale's films, and I'd been a fan of Chris Bram's writing, so as soon as I heard that Chris had written a novel about James Whale, I scurried off to get the book. And as I read it, I could just see the film, and see how it would be in his style. At that point there was a lot of interest in the book, because it was about a kind of offbeat director and "Ed Wood" was about to come out, and "Ed Wood" was about a director, and all the studio scouts were thinking this could be another "Ed Wood." But then "Ed Wood" didn't make a lot of money, and I was able to option the book for not a lot. 
MALANOWSKI What was your biggest challenge in adapting the book?
BLAKE It was a matter of elimination. As a novelist you can do things -- have dream sequences, go into backgrounds -- that a screenwriter usually can't. 
ROTH: The key was ignore the farcical stuff and concentrate on the love story. 
TALLY Condensing the story. The book is so rich; at various times you're inside the head of Lecter, Clarice, the killer Buffalo Bill. We had to focus on Clarice. We left her point of view only when we had to, most prominently for Lecter's escape. I remember Jonathan Demme, the director saying, "You know this is dangerous, cutting away from our main character in the third act for 12 minutes." But we had to include that scene. 
ZAILLIAN The key was to avoid getting lost in all the information. There's a kind of sleight-of-hand to it -- telling the story of this vast, historical experience in a small, contained story. The key was to show only as much of the Holocaust as Schindler could see.
CONDON "Father of Frankenstein" wasn't a difficult book to adapt. It had a strong dramatic spine. 
MALANOWSKI Did you have to invent much for the adaptation? 
TALLY Not much. 
ZAILLIAN Very little. We were always aware that as much as a movie, we were creating a document. That said, you had to create the dialogue between the Nazi Amon Goeth and Oskar Schindler. And while I knew facts and events, there was a lot of room to interpret character and personality. It was important to me, for example, that Goeth be a normal guy. A madman, obviously, but normal -- a guy who'd have a party, have people over, be concerned about money.
CONDON There was some invention. Mostly that was because this was a film about a film director, so opportunities would present themselves. On the first page of the book, for example, you know that Whale dies and that he'd been contemplating suicide. But we opened with him imagining his hysterical Hungarian housekeeper discovering his body. 
ROTH Forrest was supposed to weigh 300 pounds. He goes to the moon with a chimpanzee. I deviated quite a bit. 
MALANOWSKI To what extent were you involved in the casting of the movie?
ZAILLIAN Not that much. Steven Spielberg, the director and I talked about not wanting movie stars in it. He was very excited when Ralph Fiennes Goeth came along, and showed me a tape.
TALLY The very first time I met Jonathan Demme, he asked me who I saw in the film. I said Anthony Hopkins. I wanted an actor who could handle the language without making it sound stilted, and I also wanted an actor who was very good but who wasn't too familiar in this country. Anthony had done a couple of movies that hadn't done well, and frankly I think he had resigned himself to going back to England and doing theater the rest of his life. Other people were suggested -- De Niro, Dustin Hoffman. Jonathan headed them off as quickly as he could.
I also told him Jodie Foster. He thought that was a good choice, but he had just done "Married to the Mob" with Michelle Pfeiffer, and wanted her. But she had the same problem as Gene Hackman: she thought it was going to be this ugly, dark, bloody thing. Jodie, to her credit, let it be known that she wanted to do this part, and that she didn't mind being the second choice, and insisted on meeting Jonathan again and again.
CONDON Ian McKellen was the only actor we considered for Whale. Mr. Condon also directed the film. It took a couple of months for him to agree. We had a long list of people to play the housekeeper, but in reality, there were only a few good choices. We needed somebody who could walk a fine line, who could be real but who could work in that "Bride of Frankenstein" style. I saw Lynn Redgrave in "Shakespeare for My Father" onstage, and I knew she'd be perfect. Casting the pool cleaner, Clay, was most difficult, because the money people kept suggesting actors that would play well overseas, and so we would spend months waiting for people like Brad Pitt to say no. It took a long time for the money people to agree to Brendan Fraser. Ironically, right after we started shooting, "George of the Jungle" opened, and the money people had their draw. 
MALANOWSKI Did you have a good collaboration with the director?
TALLY Jonathan and I would have long discussions about all kinds of things, although I don't remember winning very often. Which was good. Jonathan just has a sense of how a thriller should roar along. Sometimes I would worry that he was cutting scenes that had important information, but he would say, "It's better to mystify an audience for five minutes than to bore them for five seconds."
ROTH This material gave me permission to be as imaginative as possible, and I probably threw in too much. It took a fine hand like Bob Zemeckis's to craft the script. For example, in an early draft, some of the things Forrest saw were animated. He'd see Jenny with angel wings, and Lieutenant Dan with a black cloud over his head. Bob saw that, as interesting as these devices might be, they'd just distract the audience. 
BLAKE In working with Kevin, we went through about six drafts, and the sixth draft is very much like the first draft. I call it the walk around the lake -- we ended up in the same place we began. Our worst moment came when a British company that was interested in investing in the movie wanted a change in the script. They wanted Stands With a Fist, the white woman being held by the Indians, to be an Indian woman who had been captured by whites and repatriated. Kevin gave me the ultimatum that either I could write it or he'd get somebody else to. That was pretty disturbing, but I decided I'd rather be in the game than on the sidelines. So I did it, and did the best I could, and fortunately, nobody liked it.
MALANOWSKI Is there a moment that came out better than you expected?
ZAILLIAN Steven is such a great visualist; once I would see scenes he shot I would no longer remember how I had visualized them. The sequence where the ghetto was cleared out was a masterpiece; I wrote dialogue, but it's incidental.
BLAKE Kevin did a great job. I think some of my favorite scenes are some of the subtlest. You go from the scene where the wagon driver is killed by three Pawnee to a scene of Dunbar cleaning up a camp and burning trash to a shot of the Pawnee seeing the smoke, and it's cinematic and economical and deft.
ROTH I was delighted by the seamless way Bob integrated the historical figures, but I was more impressed with some of the subtler things he did. I thought it was beautiful, for example, when Forrest leaves the graveyard and a flock of birds fly up.
CONDON Because the film is basically a three-hander, so much rested on the actors, and they all brought so much. I was most concerned about the part of Clay. He had to be equally interesting as the other two, but all his thoughts and feeling were inside, and untheatrical. Brendan's performance made it happen.
TALLY I very much like the scene when Clarice first comes into Buffalo Bill's house, and she realizes that he's the killer. Jodie's face does a series of little extraordinary expressions.
MALANOWSKI Was there a scene you particularly liked that was cut?
ZAILLIAN There was a scene in the latter part of the movie, when Schindler has his new factory up and running and Goeth comes to visit him. He goes onto the factory floor, where there are no guards, and somebody spits on him. He orders Schindler to have the worker shot. And Schindler steers him away, tells him that he'll take care of it later. And that's when Goeth realizes it's all over. I liked that scene, but the film was long, and really, it was a coda to his part of the story, and we were past that point.
CONDON I wrote a scene in which Whale remembers attending the opening of "Camille" at the Chinese Theater. He's sitting in the car with his lover at a moment when their relationship is good, and it's also this glamorous Hollywood, where he gets to step out of the car, and people cheer and make a fuss. And then he gets introduced as the "king of horror" and then he sees George Cukor, who's attained a level of respect that Whale never will, and the moment collapses. But we couldn't shoot it -- too expensive.
TALLY There was a piece of writing I liked, but I don't regret it not being there. The climactic scene, in which Clarice tells the story of the slaughter of the lambs, was originally written as flashback, narrated with a voice-over. You would see the events -- Clarice as a little girl, on the ranch, creeping down to the shed. There were a lot of cuts between Clarice and Lecter and the ranch, and it was very elaborate, and I was quite proud of it. Well, the ranch scenes were scheduled to be shot at the end -- we had to wait for lambing season in Wyoming. But Jonathan shot the scenes between Clarice and Lecter. Then he called me and said, "Look, I want you to see something," and he sent me the dailies. And I was amazed. What Jodie and Anthony did was so intense, and on every take! And Jonathan said, "I'll shoot that other stuff, but if I cut away from these performances, I'll be drummed out of the Directors Guild." So we skipped Wyoming and saved $1 million.
MALANOWSKI What's your most vivid memory of winning the Oscar? 
ZAILLIAN Honestly? The otherworldly couple of moments that passed getting from my seat to the stage. It really was as though I was watching this happen to somebody else.
ROTH One, there were no seats for my wife and me. There had been a mix-up. Two guys came out with seats and bolted them to the floor for us. Then, during my acceptance speech, I was thanking everybody, including my parents, who were in one of the three balconies. When I said, "They're up there somewhere," everyone thought I meant they were dead.
TALLY After they called my name, I gave Jonathan a hug. I must have looked terrified, because he said, "It's O.K. to smile." And I thought, "Once a director. . . . " 
BLAKE Taking Doris Leader Charge with me. She was the language coach on the film. When my name was called, I said, "Doris, come with me." She came onstage and translated my speech into Lakota. It meant a great deal to have a real person standing up there with me. 
CONDON My favorite moment came afterward. I was excited and overwhelmed, and I gave my speech and went offstage, and the studio's publicist took me to the press area, and there were all these cameras and reporters and producers from the morning shows. And she said, "I've got Bill Condon," and all of them said, "No," "No," "No," "No."

Beyond Tariffs: Why Steel Isn't Dead

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
A CENTURY ago, United States Steel was the Microsoft of its time, and Andrew Carnegie was his era's Bill Gates. Steel was the essential building block for the rest of the economy: automobiles, locomotives, refrigerators, building girders, oil derricks, factory machinery. 
 Fast forward to the early 21st century, and the blast furnaces that were the high tech of their day now lie hauntingly silent in one city of broad shoulders after another: Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Buffalo and Youngstown. And with more than 30 steel companies in bankruptcy, many more steel mills appear destined for the scrap heap. 
 In ways, the tariffs that President Bush announced last week to resuscitate the nation's steelmakers may only delay the inevitable. At best, many industrial analysts say, the tariffs -- up to 30 percent on imports from China, Japan, South Korea and Western Europe -- might enable some teetering steel companies to teeter another five to seven years before collapsing. 
With the nation's trading partners and steel consumers howling about protectionism, an old question has returned. Does the United States even need a steel industry? With a New Economy based on software, the Internet and financial services, shouldn't the nation let its steel mills go the way of the buggy whip? Can't the United States just import all the steel it needs from countries with lower labor costs?
The arguments against steel are well known. In "The Coming of Post-Industrial Society," published in 1973, Daniel Bell predicted that industry in general would give way to services, and in an interview last week he repeated the counts against steel. 
"There is no reason for it to be here because, fundamentally, where you have an industry in which labor is the primary cost, we can't compete and we probably shouldn't," Mr. Bell said.
But less often heard are some formidable arguments in favor of keeping steel. It remains a building-block industry. Automakers in Detroit and builders in New York work closely with domestic steelmakers to analyze how newer, stronger, more flexible steels can improve their products. 
"Steel is a foundational industry that has important linkages with other industries," said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor and the global economy at the University of California at Berkeley. "Steel is a vital to a manufacturing economy."
If footwear or apparel production moves overseas, that does not have the same ripple effect on other industries as when steel moves abroad, Professor Shaiken said. 
"What we would lose," he said, "is being at the cutting edge of developments in steel, like new alloys and new production techniques. That could hurt us in other industries, like machine tools."
Letting the American steel industry disappear could cause major problems for automakers, appliance makers and other companies that rely on steel, said David Phelps, president of the American Institute of International Steel, which represents steel importers. Without an American industry, such companies would need to order steel three to five months in advance from abroad, usually in large lots, sometimes causing delays and tying up money in inventory. In other words, it helps Whirlpool, Caterpillar and General Motors plants in the Midwest to have steel mills nearby. 
In lobbying for tariffs, the industry argued that steel is central to national defense, but that is a much-debated matter. Domestic steel, the pro-steel line went, is needed to make bombs, tanks and ships. But some say the Pentagon could easily meet its steel needs from allies overseas. 
And some say software, not steel, is now the linchpin of defense. "Security isn't about basic metals," said Loren Thompson, an analyst at the Lexington Institute, a military policy research center. "It's about photons and electrons."
STILL, the defense of steel isn't necessarily a defense of all American steel makers. Some are hugely uncompetitive, with the world's highest production costs; others are among the world's most efficient. 
"The U.S. steel industry includes a long list of highly competitive, strong companies -- U.S. Steel, AK Steel, Nucor, Ipsco, and the list goes on," said Mr. Phelps. But he said perhaps 15 percent of the nation's 100 million tons of annual steelmaking capacity is so uncompetitive that it remains alive largely because of trade protection.
Generally, it is the newer half of the American industry that is highly competitive: minimills that use electric furnaces to melt scrap to make steel. What is ailing is the heavily unionized, older half of the industry, which makes steel with coke, iron ore and blast furnaces.
So the heart of the steel debate is not necessarily whether the industry should be allowed to die; it may be which ailing companies should be allowed to go under. "The real question we should face," said Robert Crandall, an economist at the Brookings Institute, "is, How quickly do the dying giants fade away?"

A Divide-and-Conquer Strategy Comes Back to Haunt

BYLINE:  By GRETCHEN MORGENSON 

 BODY:
THE first American recession in a decade has been deemed history almost before it began. None other than Alan Greenspan, in testimony before Congress last week, opined that the recent data indicate that the economic recovery is now well under way.
 Stock investors embraced this pronouncement as evidence that corporate earnings would soon rebound. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2 percent last week, to 10,572.49, a level not seen since July 2001. 
 But even as investors prepare to bank the share gains that are supposed to result from rising corporate earnings, there is one not-so-small hitch. Because the average number of shares outstanding at many companies rocketed during the bubble, per-share earnings growth could still disappoint. And that could be the case even if the economic recovery is spectacular.
Steve Galbraith, chief investment strategist at Morgan Stanley, has done the math to make this argument. To quantify how significant and deleterious share inflation has become at the largest corporations, Mr. Galbraith took into account recent stock splits, option grants and shares issued in payment for acquisitions at companies in the Standard & Poor's 500. 
In Mr. Galbraith's view, many companies diluted their shareholders' earnings to a fare-thee-well during the stock market mania because they did not believe that printing shares was the equivalent of printing i.o.u.'s. And when stock prices were flying, shareholders paid no attention to the inflation that was occurring right under their noses. That is not surprising. It is only during bear markets that the bills for free lunches enjoyed during bull markets come due.
From 1998 to 2001, Mr. Galbraith found that share growth owing to options and acquisitions averaged 16.5 percent annually at telecommunications concerns and almost 8 percent at utility companies. Information technology companies expanded share base through options and acquisitions by 5.7 percent in that period.
Although stock issuance has started to slow, many technology companies remain swollen with shares among which company earnings must be divvied. From 1997 to 2001, for example, Cisco Systems' shares more than doubled, to 7.3 billion from 3.1 billion. A similar trend occurred at Qwest Communications, where shares rose to 1.66 billion last year from 862 million in 1998.
Stock splits were a major force behind the big increase in share counts at major companies. According to Mr. Galbraith, there were almost 400 stock splits at S.& P. 500 companies from 1997 to 1999. For years, splits had been a powerful signal of future gains in a stock. From 1995 to 1999, shares that had split gained more than 40 percent in the subsequent 12 months. But in 2000, that trend was reversed, and companies averaged a decline of 26 percent the year after their split. 
Option grants are another culprit in share inflation. While many companies brag that their option programs reward rank-and-file workers, top executives are the major beneficiaries. In 2000, according to Pearl Meyer & Partners, a compensation consulting firm in New York, more than half the nation's 200 biggest companies granted their chief executives what can only be called obscene option packages, those worth $10 million or more. Nearly 60 percent of chief executive pay that year was delivered through option grants, Pearl Meyer said.
Mr. Galbraith considers the outsized share issuance of recent years an ill effect of the stock market mania and says it will take time to reverse the trend. "The road back to prior peak earnings per share may be significantly steeper than the road back to prior peak earnings," he said. 
Put another way, it was a marvelous party. Welcome to the hangover.

Where Does Phase 2 Start? In Afghanistan

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AFTER the Taliban were driven out of power in Afghanistan, the Bush administration put out the word that it was time to go global with "Phase 2." In the next phase of the campaign against terror, American forces and their allies would pursue the remnants of Al Qaeda around the world. The United States might even continue the crusade by marching on Baghdad to take on Saddam Hussein.
 But can the United States wage a multifront campaign at a time when the fighting in Afghanistan has intensified and more than 1,000 American troops have been dispatched to do battle in the snow-capped mountains south of Gardez? Or does the Pentagon have its hands full trying to take on Qaeda fighters? 
 The answer is that success in the war in Afghanistan is not only important in its own right. It is, as some officials see it, a virtual political and military prerequisite for the Bush administration's more ambitious efforts in other regions. 
The United States has the means to mount a major military operation before the war in Afghanistan is wrapped up, though it would take a bit of juggling when it comes to logistics, reconnaissance aircraft, "smart" munitions and perhaps most important of all, Special Operations forces.
But finishing the war in Afghanistan can help in less obvious ways. The United States is sending signals to its enemies and its allies by how it is fighting in Afghanistan now, and by what it may do to secure peace there.
First, by insisting on full victory and showing that it is prepared to risk its own troops in Afghanistan, Washington is delivering a message to potential foes. In that sense, the American soldiers battling in the mountains south of Gardez are doing more than taking on the Arab, Uzbek and Chechen fighters that came to Afghanistan to fight alongside the Taliban. They are signaling the Iraqi military, in case a reminder is needed, that if Washington gives the go-ahead for a military campaign, it will be senseless to resist because the United States is prepared to do what it takes to topple Mr. Hussein. 
"If you have any doubt about the depth of our commitment, look at Afghanistan and what we did there," a senior Bush administration official said. 
AT the same time, deft handling of the political and economic aftermath of a victory in Afghanistan could ease the worries of allies who fear that the United States is better at bombing countries than helping to piece them back together again. American support for the international peacekeeping mission in this sense is more than an effort to pacify Kabul and stop Afghan warlords from quarreling. It is a test of whether the Bush administration can overcome its deep-seated anxieties about nation-building, ensure Iraq's territorial integrity and help rebuild Iraq afterward -- no small concern for Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other states in the region.
The challenge of waging war on multiple fronts is not a new one for the Pentagon. For years, the Pentagon declared that it needed to be ready to fight two nearly simultaneous regional wars. 
The argument was that if the United States did not proclaim such a goal, foes might try to take advantage every time it was tied down in a conflict. What would North Korea do if Washington were involved in a major war with Iraq or Iran, the thinking went. Critics, for their part, complained that Washington never put enough money into airlift, ocean transport and other logistical programs to support the doctrine and that it was silly to set objectives that would not be met.
But this hoary debate, which the Pentagon has never really settled, has little to do with the United States' current strategic situation. Afghanistan is a challenging conflict but not a huge drain on the Pentagon's vast resources. Only about 5,200 American troops are in Afghanistan, a force that is roughly the size of the projected international peacekeeping force in Kabul -- or the troops used to safeguard the Olympic Games in Salt Lake City.
"We had more troops for the Olympics than on the ground in Afghanistan," a senior American military official said. "You can't tell me that we are overtaxing the military. Special Forces and airlift may be stroking it. But we are not even close to breaking the system."
CERTAINLY, as the senior official noted, there are some capabilities that are in short supply. The United States has only a limited number of Predator drones, which have been equipped with Hellfire missiles and used repeatedly in Afghanistan. The Pentagon expended a huge number of its JDAM satellite-guided munitions in Afghanistan and is now running assembly lines around the clock. 
It has also committed a sizable number of Special Operations forces to the fight in Afghanistan, so much so that the Fifth Special Forces Group, which has responsibility for the Middle East, has had to draw on Special Forces units normally assigned to other regions. The Americans killed in combat in Afghanistan include members of the First Special Forces Group, which is normally assigned to Asia, and the Third Special Forces Group, which has responsibility for Africa.
But the relatively small training operations in the Philippines, Yemen and possibly Georgia do not place enormous demands on the American military. A conflict in Iraq, in contrast, would make large demands on the inventory of precision weapons and, if the United States decides to stir up an insurrection, on the Special Forces that would be used to train the insurgents and would join them in combat. 
A war with Iraq, however, is not around the corner. The United States has time to wind down its Afghan campaign, gin up the weapons production lines and reallocate its Special Operations forces.
"I think there are some significant constraints now with S.F.," said Michael Vickers, a former Army Green Beret, referring to Special Operations forces. "But I also think you can make some adjustments. I think you can do Afghanistan and Iraq."
It is also worth recalling that Washington fought and won the first Persian Gulf war without many of the capabilities, like Predator drones, that have received so much attention in Afghanistan. And Iraq's forces are far weaker than they were at the outset of the gulf war. 
"If there are some constraints, we can always make choices about where we need our capabilities more," said Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings Institution. 
The larger difficulty is the problem that top Bush administration officials might have in trying to simultaneously create a stable Afghanistan while trying to install a new government in Iraq. As much as the Bush team dislikes the term nation-building, there is still plenty of unfinished business in Afghanistan.
DETERRING a new round of civil war in Afghanistan will most likely require the expansion of the international peacekeeping force, which is currently restricted to Kabul. The United States has no plans to contribute troops for that expanded force, but it is likely to fly in other nation's troops and protect them should they get in trouble. American Special Forces are also involved in establishing the Afghan Army. The nation-building demands in Iraq if Saddam Hussein is toppled are likely to be even greater. 
"We may have the ability to fight two wars at the same time," a senior civilian American policymaker said. "But we have not demonstrated the capability to rebuild two major societies at the same time. We did not even think about Haiti until we had the troops out of Somalia. And there was no Kosovo until we put Bosnia on automatic pilot. Nation-building is more time consuming than winning the war. But it is necessary unless we want to keep coming back to these places every 10 years."
In the final analysis, however, there is no real dilemma. It makes sense for Washington to concentrate on wrapping up Afghanistan while Vice President Dick Cheney heads to the Middle East to build the case for a tougher policy against Baghdad. The success of the American military operation in Afghanistan and of the efforts to create stability in a nation that has known nothing but war for more than 20 years would not only be a signal accomplishment. It would demonstrate to everyone in the Middle East that the United States is prepared to take on the far more formidable challenge of Iraq.

Carded and Guarded

 BODY:
Across corporate America, feelings of vulnerability have pretty much dissipated. Executives are traveling, and clerks are distributing mail, though the screening process often renders it beyond recognition. 
But many companies say they have not backpedaled to the lackadaisical days before the attacks. "Every security restriction we put into place on Sept. 11 remains in place," said Susan Bishop, a spokeswoman for Textron. 
 Throughout the country, restrictions on visitors and mail and closer checks of employees' identification have become permanent. "Nothing and no one is getting into buildings without being cleared or controlled," said Howard Safir, a former New York City police commissioner who is now a security consultant. 
 Preparedness is the watchword. Pitney Bowes, which keeps its warehouses in the Northeast, may scatter caches of postage meters and other equipment throughout the country -- and may insist that its suppliers do the same. "Right now, if someone blew up the George Washington Bridge, we'd have an awful time distributing things," said Michael J. Critelli, its chief executive.
Many companies are training employees to deal with suspicious packages or substances. Others have moved mail rooms off premises. Quite a few are researching customers or suppliers. Truckers want the government to let them check new drivers against classified lists of suspected terrorists. "I think we have a reasonable chance to succeed," said William D. Zollars, chairman of the Yellow Corporation, the big trucking company.
Company security directors now have bigger budgets and are invited to executive meetings. So are representatives of companies like EDS, which provides computer security products. "We're dealing with people who are much higher on the corporate ladder," said Sean Healy, an EDS spokesman, "because security has become an executive responsibility."

Soothed at the Movies

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON 

 BODY:
 For a brief moment after the attacks, Hollywood was a kinder, gentler place. Premieres of action films like "Collateral Damage," starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, were delayed. 
And highly competitive and backbiting studio executives exchanged niceties between bites of lobster salad at Spago in Beverly Hills. "There was such a fear no one was going to the movies that people were rooting for one another," said Sherry Lansing, the chairwoman of Paramount Pictures. 
 That fear proved unfounded. Domestic box office receipts for 2001 totaled a record $8.13 billion, said ACNielsen EDI, beating 2000's $7.7 billion. This year through March 3, receipts are up 3 percent compared with the similar period in 2001, to $1.38 billion.
It didn't take long for Hollywood to settle into its old ways. Money spent campaigning for Oscars is up as much as 50 percent from two years ago. Big-budget action films returned. "Collateral Damage" opened in February. LAURA M. HOLSON

HEADLINE: From Bush's Lips, a Vow He Could Not Renege On 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9 

 BODY:
Only a few weeks ago, the White House made it clear that it would be a long time before New York would see the entire $20 billion that President Bush had promised the city days after the attack on the World Trade Center.
 "It will take some years to get there," Mitchell E. Daniels Jr., the White House budget director, declared 32 days ago, even as he and the president sought to dispel doubts about whether Mr. Bush would, in fact, live up to his commitment. 
 But by this week, the White House had accelerated its timetable, to the surprise of many here. The president gathered dozens of top New York officials at a Rose Garden ceremony on Thursday for his announcement that the money was, in effect, on its way. 
Why the sudden change? Democrats and Republicans cited a confluence of factors that ultimately forced the president's hand to deliver on his pledge to a city that did not support him in 2000.
In political terms, New York Democrats were no longer just attacking the Bush administration for failing to fulfill the president's pledge quickly. They had set their sights on another Republican, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, accusing him of not delivering for his own state in a year when he was up for re-election.
In fact, Mr. Pataki felt the need to make several direct appeals to the White House, according to people close to the governor.
They say Mr. Pataki became particularly troubled recently when the president's budget director took a series of actions that riled many New Yorkers -- and gave Democrats plenty of ammunition in the process.
Mr. Daniels, they say, ignored the Pataki administration's repeated requests that he include money for New York in the White House's federal budget proposal. (In fact, the Pataki administration and the president's budget office went back and forth on this matter on the weekend before the White House released its budget last month.)
Then Mr. Daniels publicly floated a contentious plan that the Pataki administration had urged his office not to propose, according to people close to the discussions. That plan called for counting roughly $5 billion from a federal fund for victims of the attack against the $20 billion pledge. (Mr. Daniels wound up withdrawing the proposal, but not before New York Democrats accused him of trying to pit the interests of victims against the need to rebuild the city.)
To top it off, Mr. Daniels complained that New York lawmakers were engaged in "a money-grubbing game," a comment that also provoked a furor. He later apologized for the comment.
Finally, one person close to the governor recalled, Mr. Pataki took his concerns to the president himself a few weeks ago. "The governor raised the issue with the president, and the president said he was ready to deal with it right away," the person said.
"Once the president made that strong pledge, it provided momentum to discussions" about delivering the money quickly, the same person continued. "There was no arguing anymore. It was clear that we were going to get there. It was just a matter of working out the details."
The discussions then quickly shifted to hammering out a recovery plan for New York. The state's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, was brought in to negotiate on behalf of members of New York's Congressional delegation, most of whom were kept in the dark right up until the day they boarded a bus on Capitol Hill to head over to the White House for the president's announcement, according to officials involved in the negotiations.
Looking back on it, New York politicians -- Democrats and Republicans alike -- say with amusement that they have Mr. Daniels to thank for the recovery package. "When Mitch Daniels shot his mouth off and called us money-grubbers, he really forced the issue and forced the administration to really produce," said Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from Manhattan.
The timing of the deal was also critical. The six-month mark since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks was approaching, and some New York Democrats in Congress were planning to use the date as an occasion to remind New Yorkers that the president had not made good on his promise.
"They were exposed politically until they took care of that," said Ms. Maloney, who had been planning to take the administration to task in public, but is now offering flattering words for the president.
The White House had troubles of its own. Mr. Bush's aides were still reeling from the defeat of Richard J. Riordan, the president's favored candidate in the Republican primary for governor in California. Some political strategists said the White House probably decided that it could not afford to endanger the political prospects of Mr. Pataki, another Republican ally from a big state.
"Bush just took a bunch of lumps out here in California," said one Democratic strategist in California. "He can't afford a black eye in New York." 
Finally, there was the question of what the controversy was doing to the president's own image nationally, if not in New York, a heavily Democratic state that is probably out of reach for him politically in 2004.
One Republican strategist said the White House might have decided that Mr. Bush was running the risk of appearing as if he had gone back on his word, in a way that was reminiscent of the famous tax pledge his father broke during his presidency.
"Does, 'Read my lips' sound familiar to you?" the strategist said. "This has big ramifications for the president. It has to do with his credibility. It has to do with whether people think he is keeping his word, particularly in a time like this."
Democrats agreed. "Do not underestimate how important the issues of trust and honesty are to this White House," a Democratic strategist said. "George Bush ran on restoring integrity to the Oval Office. He could not afford to go back on a high-profile public promise like this one."

HEADLINE: In Grateful Big Steel States, the Bush Democrat May Be Born 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: STEUBENVILLE, Ohio, March 7 

 BODY:
Bernie Ravasio, local steelworkers' union boss and zealous Democrat, offers a smile somewhere between mischief and delight in contemplating the notion that a new political hybrid may have been born this week, here in the bitterly depressed Ohio Valley.
 "Bush Democrats? I'd say there's a good probability of that around here now," Mr. Ravasio said in open pleasure that President Bush chose last week to resort to tariffs to protect what is left of Big Steel in its struggle against foreign competition. 
 "The man helped us, he stepped up to the plate," said Mr. Ravasio, who as president of Local 1190 of the United Steelworkers of America has had to master triage as much as labor negotiations. 
Mr. Ravasio has watched 31 American steel companies fall into bankruptcy in recent years and 17 of them die, leaving thousands of workers jobless.
"I may be a staunch Democrat, but I'll sure remember Bush for helping us," said Mr. Ravasio, whose membership has shrunk by more than half, to 1,750 workers, who have lately had to accept a 27 percent pay cut to keep the Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation mills open.
"We all remember Clinton and Gore showing up in '92 and promising to save the mills and then abandoning the issue and betraying us; we never heard from them again," said Mr. Ravasio, adding that the Clinton administration had concentrated on economic globalization at the expense of the Democratic Party's old-line, blue-collar backbone in the mills.
President Bush campaigned as a free-trader but criticized Mr. Clinton for failing to protect steelworkers from unfair competition. On Tuesday, Mr. Bush announced the three-year tariff of up to 30 percent as a temporary measure so the steel industry could restructure. 
In their relief, Local 1190 members are planning to show some political gratitude sooner or later. Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania, the steel states where jobs are most directly protected, are approaching crucial elections that could settle control of the next Congress. Mr. Ravasio said that this year and beyond union members would remember candidates who helped them, whatever their party line. 
With this in mind, the Democrats are fighting to retain their clout among the steel unions by emphasizing that President Bush, while announcing the tariffs, did not take any action on a proposal now in Congress for a bailout of up to $12 billion for hundreds of thousands of retired steelworkers. Their health care plans went bust as the domestic steel industry contracted and mills liquidated.
"This has been a desperate situation," said Charlie Stock, the local's grievance chairman, as workers visited the union hall to discuss the moment of hope presented by the Bush tariffs. 
"It'll be very interesting in the next election to see if the national union considers supporting Bush for standing by us in our worst hour," Mr. Stock said.
The tariff decision resounded through the valley mill towns like an 11th-hour bugle call. A week earlier, a caravan of 30 buses had winded eastward as Local 1190's contribution to the steel industry's big rally in Washington that pleaded for tariffs. Steelworkers, retirees worried about their health and pension plans, plus wives, children and all eight local high school bands, were aboard.
Those steelworkers still at work say they are taking a deep breath of gratitude for the president's decision, but they emphasize that they are hardly out of the woods yet. 
Their fresh hopes -- and budding new political stratagems -- arrive after five years of economic fear in which Local 1190 has weathered two bankruptcies, three work stoppages and three pay cuts in the struggle to keep Wheeling-Pittsburgh alive.
"This is just the beginning of a long row to hoe," said John Casey, 50, a local vice president who has worked 29 years in the mills. "But you're starting to see a couple of smiles now, and we know it's in our hands to make the best of this."
One sober fact in the union hall was the workers' common acceptance of what they long thought was a management ploy -- plant consolidation in the name of saving the industry.
"Consolidation is inevitable," Mr. Ravasio said, "and then there'll be a job squeeze and a new battle over which plants keep operating."
Union members say that far from instantly restoring workers to a more prosperous past, the tariff protection will mainly make the surviving mills more attractive to banks freeing up money for the task of consolidation.
The workers denied the contention that the rising cost of steel resulting from the tariffs might force cuts and layoffs in steel-using industries that more than offset the protection of steel laborers.
"I always heard every steelworker's job is worth five or so spinoff jobs in other industries," Mr. Casey said. "This should be a matter not of politics but of America first: we should take care of our own."
Staring at the Ohio River, Ken Aspenleiter, 56, the local's compensation chairman, took a long puff on his cigar outside the union hall as he assessed the effects of protectionism. 
"It buys a little more time, another lift in the roller coaster," Mr. Aspenleiter said. "We've faced everything but liquidation, and the tension is still everywhere," he explained of the years of scrambling to keep the mills going. 
"So, somebody takes care of you," the steelworker said of President Bush, "you take care of him."

HEADLINE: The Riches of Greenwich Could Bring Federal Cuts 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
THE town of Greenwich could take a cut in federal community aid next year, essentially because the White House has determined that the town is wealthy enough to do without it.
 Town officials learned last week that, under President Bush's recently proposed budget for 2003, Greenwich would receive only half of the $1.2 million in community development block grants that it received in 2002. 
 The budget, which is subject to a vote by Congress, uses a "Robin Hood" method of redistributing aid, decreasing financing to wealthy counties and redirecting it to needier ones. Specifically, the money would be diverted from areas in the country with the highest average incomes and steered to impoverished communities along the Mexican border. 
"The purpose of these block grants is to provide economic development to low-income communities, and Greenwich doesn't qualify as low income," said Amy Call, a spokeswoman for the White House Office of Management and Budget.
She said the cuts were reserved for about 10 areas in the country that had an average income at least twice the national average.
Greenwich and Westchester County are the only affected areas in the metropolitan area. In a list included in the budget proposal, Greenwich is ranked as the country's wealthiest area, with 3.2 times the national average per capita income. Westchester is ranked 10th, with 2.1 times the national average.
Greenwich officials said last week that they had gotten no official notification from the federal government about the cuts, saying they had read about the proposal in a community funding newsletter. They said the grants are vital in helping to finance a wide range of projects, including affordable housing, playgrounds and centers for children and the elderly.
Richard V. Bergstresser, the first selectman, said "cutting C.D.B.G. funding from Greenwich and sending it to Texas is just a mean-spirited political move."
In addition to hurting many lowand moderate-income people in Greenwich, the cuts will have a major effect on regional programs that provide services to Greenwich residents, such as drug treatment services and food banks, he said. "These programs will suffer without Greenwich's contribution.
"It just doesn't make sense for the White House to use per capita income as a multiple of the national average in allocating C.D.B.G. resources," he said. "Average is not an indicator of need. Greenwich has families in all income categories."
Ms. Call explained that the money pulled from the wealthier counties would total roughly $16 million and be sent to help projects in the communities, mostly in Texas, that have a predominantly Hispanic population. Some are the poorest areas in the United States.
An explanation in the budget says that the community development block grant program had become "diluted by the inclusion of some of the richest cities in the country." The reorganization is intended "to return its focus to low-income communities by redirecting funds from the wealthiest, highest-income communities to lower-income areas."
Redirecting money to "those communities with the greatest need will make the program truer to its intended purpose and less like a general revenue sharing program."
Officials at the National Association of County, Community and Economic Development, a budget watchdog group in Washington, called the cuts ill conceived.
"We're opposed to it and actively working against it," said the group's executive director, John C. Murphy. "As it exists, the funds now go to areas based on need, poverty levels and the age and cost of housing."

Tiny Technologies SlipUnseen Into Daily Life

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER 

 BODY:
When Stephen Y. Chou talks to his engineering students at Princeton about nanotechnology, he compares work in the field to boarding a space shuttle for a trip to another planet. 
 But Dr. Chou's futuristic analogy obscures how common it already is to encounter products that use nanotechnology -- the manipulation of individual molecules or groups of atoms to create useful materials or devices. 
 Indeed, in an industrial park in Somerset, N.J., less than an hour's drive north of Princeton, Dr. Chou's company, NanoOpto, recently began production of nanoscale optical components for telecommunications gear. NanoOpto is capable of churning out tens of thousands of microscopic laser-light filters and similar components each week, if demand proves to be sufficient for the devices. 
NanoOpto has joined a diverse group of down-to-earth businesses that are already making commercial use of nanotechnology, a field whose name comes from nanometer -- a unit of measure one-billionth of a meter, or a mere 10 times the diameter of a single hydrogen atom. The most recent study of the market, a global survey scheduled to be released today by CMP Cientifica, a Spanish research company, is "a snapshot of an explosion," according to Tim E. Harper, chief executive of CMP.
CMP estimates that sales of nanocomponents are around $30 million a year. But products using the microscopic materials generated sales of $26.5 billion last year, according to a recent estimate by Nanomat, a European consortium of companies and research institutions involved in nanotechnology. And the National Science Foundation, the lead agency administering nanotechnology research financed by the United States government, predicts the total will soar to $1 trillion by 2015. 
Nanoproducts are showing up in khakis, where they contribute to stain resistance, and cosmetics, where they are used as sunscreens. Smith & Nephew, the world's largest supplier of wound treatment products, markets an antimicrobial dressing covered with silver nanocrystals that are made by Nucryst Pharmaceuticals, a subsidiary of the Westaim Corporation. 
Pilkington and PPG, two major glass manufacturers, have introduced competing "self-cleaning" window glass products with a surface layer of nanoscale titanium dioxide particles. Although titanium dioxide is conventionally used as a whitener in paint, these particles are so small they are transparent. The particles interact with ultraviolet rays in sunlight, loosen dirt and, then, with water, distribute the dirt evenly across the surface. As a result, most dirt washes off easily without streaking whenever it rains. 
General Motors is offering optional running boards for its Safari and Astro vans made from plastics reinforced with nanoscale bits of clay. The new materials are stronger and lighter than the traditional polyolefin plastic panels they replace, which have been reinforced with calcium carbonate, talc or other minerals. Although the particles cost more per pound than do traditional reinforcements, the total price of the panels to G.M. is the same or lower because the nanoparticles make up less than 5 percent of the end product, compared with 30 percent or more for traditional reinforcement materials. 
G.M. and its partners in the development, Basell (a joint venture of BASF and Shell), Blackhawk Automotive Plastics, and Southern Clay Products (a subsidiary of Rockwood Specialties), are testing the use of the new composites in other portions of car exteriors and for use in dashboards. 
"It's just a matter of building momentum," said Robert A. Ottaviani, group lab manager for materials and processes at General Motors Research and Development. "The majority of our materials will be some kind of nanocomposite by the middle of the decade."
Most researchers trace today's visions of a nanotechnology future to Dec. 29, 1959, the day the physicist Richard P. Feynman gave a lecture to the American Physical Society titled "There Is Plenty of Room at the Bottom." By the conventional definition, nanoscale objects have dimensions below 100 nanometers. 
As Dr. Chou's space travel analogy implies, the potential products at that scale -- microscopic electronics, miniature power plants, miracle medicines -- seem like science fiction. When engineers venture into the world of nanoscale dimensions, they enter an alien environment of atomic and molecular forces that can sometimes produce unexpected results. Nucryst, for example, has discovered that nanoscale silver particles not only kill microbes, as silver has long been known to do, but also appear to reduce inflammation.
Many of the current commercial applications do not require the kinds of uniform features and numbingly precise layouts that researchers know will be needed for future nanoproducts -- like sugar-cube-size devices capable of storing as much data as the Library of Congress. By comparison, current nanomaterials can have wide variations. The silica-coated clay particles in sunscreen products, for example, can range from 5 nanometers to 80. And stain-resistant fabrics like those used in Eddie Bauer's Nano-Care khakis are designed with surface fibers of 10 to 100 nanometers, according to Nano-Tex, the Burlington Industries subsidiary that developed the technology. 
Many visionary nanoscale products will require new manufacturing systems, but most of today's nanoproducts rely heavily on equipment that industry already owns and understands. NanoOpto's factory in Somerset, for example, is filled with clean-room equipment and microchip processing stations the company acquired at bargain-basement prices from struggling giants like Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks.
NanoOpto uses its own imprinting technique to populate silicon wafers with its nanoscale filters and light polarizing devices, but the four-inch silicon wafers it starts with have been standard throughout the semiconductor industry since the 1970's.
Nano-Tex creates its nanoscale fibers by applying innovative chemistry and processing adjustments to existing textile equipment, and the controlled production of nanoscale particles in plastic has emerged from years of tinkering with commercial equipment for purifying, chemically altering, mixing, dispersing and processing natural minerals and oils, or their synthetic equivalents. 
Many of the companies with commercial products are experiencing the usual tribulations of pioneers, including unexpected production kinks, cautious customers and, in the last year, the impact of the recession.
Nanophase Technologies, one of the few publicly traded start-ups in the field, reported last month that revenues for 2001 were $4 million, down from $4.3 million the previous year. The company, based in Romeoville, Ill., had a net loss last year of $5.7 million.
Nanocor, a subsidiary of Amcol International, has had slower than expected growth in demand for its nanoscale clay fillers. And some promising products that Nanocor has developed with partners, like nanocomposite plastic called Imperm for packaging, have yet to find customers.
"It wouldn't be fair to say we are happy with where we are at this point," said Ronald C. Gartner II, Nanocor's technical sales manager.
Despite the growing pains, many experts say nanotechnology is catching on much faster than they had expected.
"The things I said a few years ago would be prototypes in 2005 are here now," James C. Ellenbogen, who heads the nanotechnology division at the Mitre Corporation, which specializes in government-supported technical research. "There has been a sharp upsurge in the number of venture capitalists at science meetings."
Many potential investors are having a hard time figuring out where to place their bets, said Josh Wolfe, a partner at Lux Capital, a New York venture capital firm.
The materials business, which has been the focus of early commercialization, is treacherous ground for venture capital, he said, because it is dominated by giant companies and often requires large investments in production facilities and equipment.
That is why many investors are instead looking at companies that make tools or software. NanoOpto, for instance, has attracted investors, in part, by presenting its production technology as a capability that could be licensed to others even as the company tries to develop markets for its own optical products.
A few publicly traded toolmakers are already feeling a nanotechnology tail wind -- most notably Veeco, a leading manufacturer of the high-resolution microscopes commonly used to study nanoscale interactions.
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing now uses such microscopes not just in its laboratories but on its production lines to monitor the quality of the optical films it makes for products like computer screens.
Such paper-thin films are made of 200 to 1,000 layers of material. Some of them are only tens of nanometers deep, and that thickness must be accurate to as little as three nanometers, or about 15 atoms, said Andrew Ouderkirk, a corporate scientist at 3M. 
The demand for better tools and processes can only intensify as commercialization of nanotechnology continues, said many experts, like Kenneth B. Sinclair, a plastics industry consultant in Snohomish, Wash. "There is a lot to the technology that is not optimized yet," he said.

The Web world watchesclosely as British Telecommunications stakes a patent claim on a now-ubiquitous function: hyperlinking.

BYLINE:  By Laurie J. Flynn 

 BODY:
THE software industry has long been a staging ground for huge battles over intellectual property, starting perhaps 15 years ago when Apple Computer accused Microsoft of stealing the look and feel of the Macintosh. Today, the industry is awaiting an early-stage decision in the case of British Telcommunications v. Prodigy, another closely watched patent fight that, as have many before it, challenges a ubiquitous computing operation.
 At a preliminary hearing in a federal court in Westchester County, N.Y., last month, British Telecommunications, a subsidiary of the BT Group, asserted that it owned a patent on what is now known as hyperlinking, the process of linking Web pages so users can move from one page to another by simply clicking on highlighted text. Hyperlinking, a function about as basic to the Web as ramps are to a highway, is used by nearly every Web page, so that virtually no browsing can take place without it. According to British Telecom's arguments, without the technology that the company says is covered in its patent, now nearly 13 years old, computer users would have to know the address of a page before they could jump to it. 
 Federal District Judge Colleen McMahon in White Plains is expected to hand down a preliminary ruling any day now, and a trial date has been set for Sept. 15. That follows a hearing in which Judge McMahon bemoaned the challenge of finding jurors who would not be "terrified" of the jargon used in the case.
In the meantime, debate over the British Telecom patent is growing more vocal, and in many ways more incredulous.
"This is easily one of the most controversial patents out there," said Charles Cella, a patent lawyer and chief executive of BountyQuest, an Internet company that offers rewards for information indicating that an invention was publicly available before a patent was issued. "It's right up there with Amazon's one-click patent, and Priceline's patent on the reverse auction."
The patents of Amazon.com and Priceline.com are often held up as examples of high-technology patents that have generated income and, at the same time, absorbed enormous amounts of time from courts and companies. Amazon's one-click ordering allows returning customers to use a single mouse click to check out, skipping several steps by having their credit card and shipping information stored. The company sued its chief rival, BarnesandNoble.com, and recently settled after several years of legal jockeying.
Priceline's patent, awarded in 1998, covers the name-your-own-price model that has become associated with the auction site. Faced with a challenge from Expedia.com's Hotel Price Matcher service, Priceline went to battle in October 1999 with Microsoft, which owns a majority stake in Expedia. The parties settled in January 2001, and today Microsoft, which is selling its stake in Expedia to USA Networks, pays royalties to use the reverse-auction model.
As has the British Telecom patent, the Amazon and Priceline patents have tested the patience of many parts of the Internet world. But there is at least one important difference: unlike those patents, British Telecom's predates the Web by many years. Since the patent was granted in 1989, hyperlink technology has established itself as the standard for linking pages on the Internet.
British Telecom officials said that during a routine review of the company's enormous patent portfolio in 2000, they discovered that that the company's Hidden Page patent included the technology that powers hypertext links. Hidden Page was part of a technology called Prestel, developed to allow networked computers at the British postal service to communicate. (At the time, British Telecom was part of Britain's government telecommunications and postal monopoly.) 
In December 2000, the British company filed suit against Prodigy, which originally had headquarters in White Plains, after contacting nearly a dozen Internet service providers in an unsuccessful effort to have them license hyperlinking technology.
Robert Perry, a lawyer with Kenyon & Kenyon who is representing British Telecom, will not say why the company singled out Prodigy, though obviously it was a strategic choice.
Prodigy, the first commercial Internet service provider and now a unit of SBC Communications, makes a good test case because it is typical of the market, yet not big enough to outgun British Telecom the way, say, AOL might. (But AOL was among the 17 companies that British Telecom says it contacted in mid-2000 to invite them to license the patent.)
At last month's hearing, Judge McMahon warned British Telecom's lawyers that it might be difficult to prove that a patent that was applied for in 1976, long before the Web was invented, and granted in 1989, applies to modern computing. The job falls to Mr. Perry and the rest of the company's legal team to show that the Hidden Page patent is so broad as to cover Web hyperlinking.
Though British Telecom's suit may seem far-fetched, few in the Internet industry are minimizing the stakes. Virtually every Internet service provider, and every Web business, for that matter, could have something to lose. A final judgment in British Telecom's favor could even mean higher fees for consumers as service providers pass down their licensing costs.
But critics say British Telecom's patent claim may not stand up under scrutiny. They insist that when the defense goes looking for evidence that the technology existed before the patent application was filed, they will find plenty of it.
In December 1968, Douglas C. Engelbart, a Stanford Research Institute researcher credited with inventing the computer mouse, gave a lengthy public demonstration of an online system called NLS. During that presentation, a film of which is on the Stanford University Web site, Mr. Engelbart demonstrated the dynamic linking of files, in which clicking on certain words in a computer program could make a new page of text appear. And before that, in 1963, a British computer scientist, Ted Nelson, coined the word "hypertext," and described the concept in a 1965 book, "Literary Machines."
Hyperlinking has a been a thorny subject since the onset of electronic commerce. In Michigan, a judge recently rejected arguments by Ford Motor that its trademark was being violated by a hyperlink that sent viewers of a Web site critical of General Motors to Ford's site. In the music industry, several lawsuits have revolved around the practice of linking to sites that provide access to copyrighted music and movies. And several years back, Ticketmaster sued rival Web sites for hyperlinking to pages deep inside Ticketmaster, a back-door practice that meant customers could bypass greetings and advertisements that Ticketmaster wanted its viewers to see.
In British Telecom v. Prodigy, it is now up to Judge McMahon to decide the next step in hyperlinking's legal history. And with stakes this high, it should be a battle worth watching.

 CORRECTION:
The New Economy column in Business Day on March 11, about efforts by British Telecommunications to claim patent rights to the technology underlying hypertext links, which let computer users navigate the Internet by clicking on highlighted text, misstated the nationality of Ted Nelson, the computer scientist credited with coining the term hypertext in 1963. He is a citizen of the United States, not Britain.

HEADLINE: When Wall Street Advice Turns Costly 

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT and SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
Claus Reinisch, a retired New York City civil servant, lives alone in an unassuming studio apartment on Manhattan's Upper West Side. Jack B. Grubman, an analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, lives with his family in a $6.2 million town house on the Upper East Side that he paid for in cash.
 Mr. Reinisch, who came to New York from the Netherlands at the age of 10 as a refugee from the Holocaust, has pieced together a nest egg of about $300,000 after years of investing. Mr. Grubman, a native of Philadelphia, is estimated to have made at least $30 million in salary and bonuses the last three years. 
 The two men have little in common except for Global Crossing, the former telecommunications highflier that filed for bankruptcy protection in late January. Mr. Reinisch, who has a brokerage account at Salomon, lost virtually all the money he had invested in Global Crossing stock after hewing to the advice of Mr. Grubman, Salomon's top telecommunications research analyst. 
Mr. Reinisch is but one of many small investors who lost money on Global Crossing. And many did so by following research advice from Salomon and some of the other largest investment firms on Wall Street. In a striking example of the conflicts that can arise in today's full-service financial industry, those same firms were making tens of millions of dollars from banking and stock-underwriting relationships with Global Crossing while the firms' analysts urged brokerage clients to keep buying the stock -- even as the company was heading toward financial collapse.
Mr. Reinisch, who is 70, says he can survive the loss of the $10,000 or so that he invested in Global Crossing, whose shares traded as high as $61.8125 in February 2000 but closed on Friday at 9.2 cents. He can let go of the fact that the company's chairman, Gary Winnick, had the good timing to reap more than $730 million from Global Crossing stock deals before the bottom fell out. What angers Mr. Reinisch is that while company insiders seemed to know when to sell, individual investors like him were left to rely on the guidance of experts like Mr. Grubman who urged them to stay the course.
Mr. Grubman's advice could seem so compelling. "There are historic opportunities to buy world-class assets such as Global Crossing that are evolving into world-class operating businesses at compelling value," Mr. Grubman said in a report on June 18, 2001, when the shares closed at $7.68, already 88 percent below their peak.
Even by Oct. 1, when Global Crossing's shares were down to $1.90, Mr. Grubman was urging Salomon's brokerage clients not to abandon hope.
"The bottom line is we believe that Global Crossing is not a potential bankruptcy candidate in the near term," Mr. Grubman wrote that day, less than four months before the company's bankruptcy filing.
Mr. Reinisch first acquired Global Crossing shares by dint of the company's 1999 acquisition of the telephone company Frontier, in which he had been a shareholder. He bought additional shares of Global Crossing twice during 2001 after reading Mr. Grubman's advice.
At the end of last year, he sold part of his Global Crossing holdings for a loss of about $2,500. The main reason he has not yet sold the rest, Mr. Reinisch said, was that the brokerage fees from doing so would outweigh the proceeds.
"It gets me outraged," Mr. Reinisch said. He acknowledged that all of Salomon's research reports had labeled Global Crossing a "speculative" investment. "Everyone is greedy, and maybe I was a little bit, too. But that's no excuse for the quality of the advice I received."
A spokeswoman for Salomon, Mary Ellen Hillery, declined to comment on Mr. Reinisch's complaint, citing a policy that prevents the firm from publicly discussing a client's accounts. 
Mr. Reinisch has not filed a formal complaint with Salomon, she said. "Any serious concerns raised by our clients are thoroughly investigated."
Mr. Grubman, through Ms. Hillery, also declined to comment. He stopped recommending Global Crossing to clients in early October, after the company missed a key revenue target. By that time, though, Salomon had already benefited from a fruitful investment banking relationship with Global Crossing.
Ostensibly, Wall Street firms strictly separate their research analysis from their stock and bond underwriting and investment banking services. And yet, more than perhaps any other stock analyst on Wall Street, Mr. Grubman has been said to use his status as one of the industry's top telecommunications analysts to help attract and retain clients for his firm. In recent years, according to Thomson Financial Securities, Salomon, a unit of Citigroup, has underwritten more telecommunications stocks and bonds and provided more merger advice for telecommunications companies than has any other Wall Street firm.
Salomon's investment banking ties with Global Crossing date from May 1998, when it arranged the sale of more than $700 million of the company's debt, along with Merrill Lynch. Since then, Salomon has helped Global Crossing issue stock twice and assisted the company in selling debt three more times, while also underwriting the stock offering of the Asia Global Crossing subsidiary.
Salomon was not alone in continuing to recommend Global Crossing's shares deep into the stock's descent. At Goldman, Sachs & Company, which sold stock and arranged loans for Global Crossing, the analyst Frank J. Governali recommended the stock until last Oct. 4, when it closed at $1.07.
Ed Canaday, a Goldman spokesman, declined to speak to the specifics of Mr. Governali's recommendations on the stock, other than to say, "Goldman, Sachs is committed to producing timely, independent fundamental research."
Merrill Lynch, which sold stocks and bonds for Global Crossing, was recommending that investors buy the stock until late September. And at J. P. Morgan Chase, which had perhaps the most diverse financial relationships with Global Crossing, the equity analyst David Glaymon was still bullish on the company last spring. With the stock at $10.39 a share, on April 17, he forecast that it would hit $29 within 12 months.
By Aug. 6, with the stock tumbling to $5.93 a share, David W. Barden, another J. P. Morgan Chase analyst, was still recommending Global Crossing as a "long-term buy."
J. P. Morgan Chase had plenty of reasons to want Global Crossing to succeed. The company's need for billions of dollars to build its worldwide fiber optic system, and its appetite for acquisitions, made Global Crossing an extremely lucrative client, one banking expert noted.
Not only did J. P. Morgan Chase act as a lender to Global Crossing, but it also sold bonds for the company, provided advice on mergers and acquisitions and even did some private banking for Mr. Winnick.
J. P. Morgan Chase has said that it stood to lose as much as $100 million in loans that were made in which the only collateral was now largely worthless stock in Global Crossing subsidiaries. Those losses, however, may have been partly or even completely offset by the fees the firm made as Global Crossing's banker and adviser. 
For the individuals who listened to the advice dispensed by analysts at J. P. Morgan Chase, Salomon and Global Crossing's other Wall Street firms, the losses may have a far more lasting financial impact.
Mr. Reinisch, for one, said he was still mystified by the seeming swiftness of Global Crossing's decline. He said he had twice called the office of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, to see if Congress planned to look more thoroughly into the company's spectacular ride on Wall Street. As of Friday, he said he had received no response.
But whatever his questions about Global Crossing, his resentment is mostly aimed at Salomon. "I still find it difficult to believe that this major brokerage firm acted in this fashion," Mr. Reinisch said. "I feel like I was snookered by these guys."

HEADLINE: Cisco and Sprint Venture Has First Big Client 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS GAITHER 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 10 

 BODY:
As it tries to regain the torrid pace that briefly made it the world's most valuable company, Cisco Systems is counting heavily on winning new customers among telecommunications providers, one of the sectors hardest hit by the slowed economy. 
 Cisco's routers and switches sit at the heart of many corporate networks, but the company has found trouble replicating that success when it comes to the huge voice and data networks run by the Baby Bells. Lucent Technologies and Nortel Networks, though struggling themselves, dominate that market. 
 Cisco's latest efforts have borne some fruit, though it has had better luck selling equipment through service providers than to them. Cisco and Sprint plan to announce today that they have together won a five-year, $25 million contract to outfit Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland with a next-generation Internet network that will deliver blazingly fast connections. The university deal is the first major contract signed since the two companies forged a broad alliance in December. 
Starting with a new building, designed by Frank Gehry, in the Weatherhead School of Management, the network will make its way into 94 buildings by next year. Professors, students and researchers will be able to surf the Internet from anywhere on campus using a fast wireless connection, and Ethernet connections to desktop computers will be 10 to 100 times faster than most wired networks today, university officials said. Internet data, cable television and, eventually, telephone calls, will run over one network.
"In higher education today, this is the fastest network, period," said Lev Gonick, the university's vice president for information services. 
Operating through its consulting division, Cisco is working with Sprint and other telecommunications companies to create new services like faster connections or training videos streamed over the Web -- services that usually require Cisco products.
"No one big player has all the answers," said Charles J. Salameh, vice president for data and managed enterprise services at Bell Canada, which recently worked with Cisco and others to land government contracts in Canada.
While deals like the Case Western Reserve contract are important, Cisco officials know that the big money is in building and upgrading communications backbones for carriers like SBC Communications, Verizon Communications and Bell South. Last week, Nortel announced that it had won a three-year, $500 million deal to upgrade the Cingular wireless network.
But the telecommunications industry is expected to cut spending on equipment by up to 10 percent this year, after a drop of 42 percent last year, according to the investment bank CIBC World Markets. Telecommunications equipment makers bore the brunt of the slowdown, racking up billions in losses and slashing tens of thousands of jobs. 
"Any time there's that kind of upheaval, you're going to be giving up opportunities with customers," William Nuti, Cisco's senior vice president for worldwide service-provider operations, said, referring to his competitors.
W. Stephen Kamman, an analyst with CIBC, said Cisco will be hard pressed to meet its goals for 30 percent growth in the next few years. While corporations should begin spending money on information technology when the economy recovers, Cisco's dominance leaves little room for it to gain market share. And while telecommunications equipment remains a huge opportunity for Cisco, he said, the industry's troubles run much deeper than the economy.
But Cisco is convinced that the next generation of telecommunications networks will move to its specialty, Internet Protocol. Lucent and Nortel sell most of the equipment for today's network technology, called asynchronous transfer mode.
Mr. Kamman said that if, as he suspects they will, telecommunications networks move to Internet Protocol, Cisco could eventually emerge as the leader in carrier equipment, as it did in local networks.
"That future network remains very much a jump ball," he said. "That means the sector is going to remain interesting."

HEADLINE: Argentina Says It Needs More Economic Aid to Avert Turmoil 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: FORTALEZA, Brazil, March 10 

 BODY:
Argentina pleaded today for renewed international financial help to overcome its deep economic crisis, warning of more social and political upheaval if it did not receive rescue loans.
 "To overcome the crisis sooner, we need the support of the international community, not just with words but with loans and funds," said the economy minister, Jorge Remes Lenicov. 
 Without immediate aid, Mr. Remes told international investors and finance officials from across the hemisphere at the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank, the crisis will deepen and the government may not survive until September elections. "It is continuity or anarchy," said the deputy economy minister, Jorge Todesca. "That is the risk we see." 
In December, Argentina declared default on its $141 billion public debt and issued banking restrictions that angered the public and set off protests that ousted two presidents in two weeks. The currency, the peso, has lost half its value since devaluation in January.
Today, finance ministers from other Latin American nations, hoping to prevent the spread of financial turbulence, backed Argentina's urgent call for assistance from the International Monetary Fund and other lending agencies.
The fund last week reopened negotiations with Argentina, whose new government has floated the peso and begun to lift controls imposed last year to avoid a run on the banks.
Mr. Remes and Mr. Todesca met with the United States Treasury under secretary for international affairs, John Taylor, who praised the changes Argentina's financial authorities are making.
Executives of private international banks facing major losses in Argentina said they felt encouraged after hearing Mr. Remes lay out his plan for recovery in Argentina, South America's second-largest economy.
But the bankers said they did not know whether Argentina would be stable enough for them to continue operating in the country, where their assets were hit by devaluation.
"Things are going in the right direction, but we are still a long way from knowing whether the system is viable or not, and whether it is feasible to continue operating there," said an executive of a European bank that does business in Argentina.
The banker said a lot would hinge on agreement with the monetary fund on an economic program that would unblock $9 billion remaining from a rescue package granted to Argentina last year. 
That program was suspended in November because Argentina was unable to control spending and reduce its fiscal deficit.

HEADLINE: The Enemy Is Poverty 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Facing Down Diehards; No Easy Victory Is Seen in Fierce Battle With a Foe That Seems to Prefer Death" (military analysis, front page, March 5):
 While American personnel abroad secure freedom and stability, let us not forget what we are truly at battle with behind the masses of unnamed and faceless forces, the true propellant of aggression: poverty. 
 This is the lowest common denominator of most conventional ills and serves to mobilize and sustain those who would deny their fellow man a peaceful existence. 
Only when a strategy using military deterrence, economic sanctions and aid, and nation-building is placed in action may we hope to pull the citizens of the world from the clutch of poverty. Then we can undermine the source of power of those who manipulate their brethren to serve their own ends.

HEADLINE: Six Months Later 

 BODY:
Any realistic estimate of where we are, six months after Sept. 11, begins with the families, the businesses, the downtown neighbors most immediately affected by that increasingly distant day. For them, and to a lesser extent for all of us, the rate of recovery at the World Trade Center site is the best metaphor. The wreckage has nearly all been removed, but in its place there remains an empty pit, as symbolic in its own way as the fallen shards of the towers themselves. Most of the victims' families have faced the worst of what they have to face, and what remains is the day-to-day recognition of an emptiness that should never have been. 
 Six months ago, no one could have begun to hope that ground zero would look the way it does today. The astonishing job done by rescue workers and heavy-equipment teams has allowed New York City to recover psychologically much more swiftly than anyone could have expected. None of this diminishes the gravity of the site itself, where bodies are still being found. That day rises up in all of us without warning. To be carried back to that morning in memory is to discover how unbelievable it now seems. Some version of ordinary life has recaptured most of us since then, and it feels welcome. 
 Everyone knew that sooner or later the emotional shock of Sept. 11 would be absorbed by the procedures of recovery and, in a sense, by the city going about its business. The state of crisis eventually gave way to political discussions and labor negotiations, to long-term planning meetings and complicated financial arrangements. At first it seemed almost shocking when the immediate tragedy began to yield to practical problem solving on a bureaucratic level. But that too is one of the things that has helped many people recover their balance much more quickly than expected. 
In the past six months, New York has learned more about itself in a shorter time than it ever has before. Most of us are still coming to grips with that knowledge, trying to understand, for instance, why it should take the worst of days to bring out the best in us. The depravity of the terrorists and the generosity of so many of the victims and rescuers still wrestle in our minds. History is always reminding us how paradoxical human nature is, but every generation has to relearn that fact. This was our instruction.
In some ways, the hardest thing now is living not with the immediacy of Sept. 11, which has diminished, but with its global consequences. Almost all the news -- economic, political, international -- seems to have spun off from that one day, although that one day was merely a single episode in a global struggle that has taken years to develop. So much has gone right in our own recovery, emotionally and economically. But every day a reminder comes, from the front in Afghanistan, from the Middle East, from somewhere, that we cannot afford to recover on our own.

HEADLINE: In Red Hook, Worries on the Waterfront 

BYLINE:  By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN 

 BODY:
For now, there is nothing especially remarkable about the old Civil War-era warehouse on the edge of the Red Hook waterfront.
 But about a year from now, much of Brooklyn is expected to bound through its doors. The building, once a coffee warehouse, is about to become a Fairway supermarket, the borough's first and New York City's third. In its size and mission, Red Hook's Fairway will mirror the grocer's Harlem store, bringing not only upscale foods but hundreds of jobs to an isolated corner of the city. 
 Working with the developer, Greg O'Connell, a former New York City detective whose spent two decades buying and reviving properties on Red Hook's waterfront, Fairway expects to hire 375 neighborhood residents in an array of entry-level union jobs. Mr. O'Connell and Fairway are sharing the purchase and renovation costs, roughly $15 million. 
The project has cleared virtually every hurdle facing it -- including a two-year fight with the city, which had owned the building, and City Councilman Angel Rodriguez of Brooklyn, who had argued that it was better suited for affordable housing. As a compromise, 45 market-rate apartments will be built above the new Fairway, and 33,000 square feet of free work space will be created for local artists and nonprofit groups.
Solving the one remaining challenge, however, has not proved so easy for Mr. O'Connell. He wants to bring in Fairway despite the fact that his plan has divided Red Hook in almost every imaginable way: old-timers versus newcomers, homeowners versus residents of public housing, and worst of all, blacks versus whites.
"Fairway creates jobs, good union jobs," Mr. O'Connell said recently.
"And they add to whatever neighborhood they go into," he added. "Look at what they accomplished in Harlem." He was referring to a meat-packing plant that Fairway turned into a market in 1993, employing about 400 people from Harlem. That plan was also criticized, said Tom Hoover, a Fairway spokesman.
Mr. O'Connell said: "Why shouldn't Red Hook have the same opportunity? When this store is finally here and they see what a big difference it makes in people's lives and what a big draw it is for people outside of Red Hook, everyone's going to love it."
Everyone, except the people, artists and activists, who live in the multifamily homes and renovated industrial buildings along an area known as the Back, which stretches from Richards Street to the waterfront. They are furious about the flood of traffic they believe Fairway will bring to Van Brunt Street, which is Red Hook's major road and access to the waterfront.
"Putting a giant store on a narrow street in a remote location like Red Hook simply doesn't make sense, especially coming from a developer who has made promises before and not honored them," said John McGettrick, a longtime activist and outspoken opponent of Mr. O'Connell's, referring to a stalled effort by Mr. O'Connell to build a public walkway along the waterfront. (Mr. O'Connell says that walkway plan is tied up in city bureaucracy.)
Still more troubling for people in the Back is the way their opposition has been twisted into racism and snobbery in the eyes of many of their neighbors on the other side of Red Hook, those who live in the towering Red Hook Houses, a public housing development that is home to three-quarters of Red Hook's dwindling population of about 12,000 people. Most of the housing development's residents are black or Latino.
"They're being used," said Lou Sones, another critic. "When the people living in public housing start living in the Back, they're not going to want a Fairway and the traffic it brings, either. But because the people in the Back happen to be white and homeowners, the perception is, 'You white people are against public housing people getting jobs.' It's a sad lie."
But residents of the Red Hook Houses insist that some of those who live in the Back are floating a few lies of their own, like the dire warnings of nightmarish traffic.
"Red Hook has always had traffic," said Emma Broughton, 71, a resident of the Houses for four decades. "We used to have the big trucks coming with the containers from the ships and we lived with that. This is really about the people in the Back not wanting people from the projects coming on their side, shopping and getting jobs. That grocery store is the biggest thing that's wanted to come here, and they'd rather fight it than watch it help poor people."
Even local economic and employment groups have been hard pressed to understand the furor, particularly given the need for jobs among the residents of the Houses. "When you're dealing with an 18 percent unemployment rate in a neighborhood and a company like Fairway comes along offering jobs and benefits to people who really want to work, that's something the whole neighborhood should be able to realize as a benefit to everyone's quality of life," said Phaedra Thomas, director of the South Brooklyn Local Development Corporation's office in Red Hook, which provides job counseling and job retention strategies for local residents and businesses.
In the swirl of finger-pointing, people on all sides of the debate said that perhaps the most important issue -- the lack of an affordable place to shop for groceries -- was being overlooked. "We're all being taking advantage of," said Marion, 35, a Red Hook resident, as she shopped the aisles of Food Bazaar, Red Hook's only supermarket. Underscoring the tensions over the issue, she did not want her last name in the newspaper. "Look, look over here," she said. "They want you to pay $2.42 for two bell peppers. It's a rip-off."
For their part, officials at Food Bazaar say they worry that the neighborhood may not be large enough to support two markets, especially if one is a Fairway, whose Harlem and Upper West Side locations are known for drawing customers from around the city. But they are hopeful that their own prices will be more in line with the pockets of Red Hook residents.
The store is located directly across the street from the Red Hook Houses, just outside Ms. Broughton's front door, yet she does not shop there, not even for the occasional loaf of bread or carton of milk.
Twice a month, she and several of her neighbors wait, sometimes for as long as a half-hour, for the B61 bus to take them to a Pathmark supermarket on the other side of the Gowanus Expressway. They load up on groceries, then share the cost of car service back to Red Hook. (One of Fairway's promises is a service that will shuttle elderly shoppers to and from the new store.)
When Food Bazaar opened earlier this year, replacing a supermarket called the Big R, the aisles were filled with excited shoppers. James Jordan, 42, was among the dozens who stood in line hoping to find employment. It did not happen.
Now a part-time laundry attendant, he says he would love to work at Fairway. With a wife and six children, he said, the benefits alone would be a big help. Yet he admits he is somewhat skeptical of Fairway.
"It's easy to promise nice things to people in the projects," he said as he updated his resume at a local employment office. "We've heard everything and hardly any of it ever happens. As good as this sounds, this is still Red Hook."

HEADLINE: Taming the Consumer's Computer 

BYLINE:  By Jonathan L. Zittrain; Jonathan L. Zittrain is an assistant professor at Harvard Law School and a director of its Berkman Center for Internet & Society.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Last month the top executives of two of the most powerful media companies in the world traveled to Washington to testify before Congress about the most dangerous threat they face: the American consumer.
 Of course they didn't quite phrase it that way. Michael Eisner, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, complained that the technology industry made it too easy for "people wanting to get anything for free on their television or computer or hand-held device." Peter Chernin, president of the News Corporation, worried that the Internet's "ability to empower the general public" would lead to the online theft of some of the contents of media companies' digital treasuries. 
 Both men want the next generation of personal computers to be unable to deliver unauthorized movies, music and other content, and they asked that Congress stand ready to intervene if industry failed to deliver the necessary technology to safeguard its products. A lone executive, from Intel, objected. The market, he said, not Congress, should dictate how technology works.
The debate on Capitol Hill between content providers like Disney and those who make the products to deliver that content, like Intel, was really a proxy for a much larger debate: What do we want our technology to do? How do we want it to work? And do we have any say in the matter?
For most forms of current technology, these questions have long been settled. No executives are worried about illegal uses of televisions or coffee makers, for instance, and no consumers need to worry that these appliances will crash or become infected with viruses -- and we would never accept it if they did. Our TV's and VCR's don't take ill when we watch infected programs, and our refrigerators never require rebooting.
Yet we have come to tolerate such problems from our personal computers. The PC's fundamental and unique unreliability flows from its construction as a so-called flexible platform -- a mere staging area for many kinds of software. The point (and bane) of a PC is, essentially, to run whatever software it encounters.
There are plenty of reliable computers: the controls of the modern Airbus 340 are fully given over to a computer, and video-game consoles consistently work as advertised, as do Aegis missile cruisers, cellular telephones and digital watches. All contain transistors. Can technologists figure out how to replicate the reliability of airplanes, telephones, watches and televisions in future versions of Windows and Linux, so that a mischievous 12-year-old half a world away can't erase a thousand far-flung hard drives?
Absolutely. In January Bill Gates sent a memo to all Microsoft employees declaring a new, overarching, even revolutionary mandate: Software must be reliable and "trustworthy." This new focus is both welcome and worrisome, because the very steps needed to secure our computers and networks can be the steps that will deaden them to continued innovation and creative uses -- while opening them to more intrusive monitoring by mainstream technology manufacturers and content providers.
Mr. Gates and the co-captains of his industry are producing blueprints for so-called "trusted" PC's. They will employ digital gatekeepers that act like the bouncers outside a nightclub, ensuring that only software that looks or behaves a certain way is allowed in. The result will be more reliable computing -- and more control over the machine by the manufacturer or operating system maker, which essentially gives the bouncer her guest list.
And as soon as there are limits on the software a PC can run, there will be limits on what PC users can do. That's exactly what executives like Mr. Eisner and Mr. Chernin want. They'd like software and hardware companies to build PC's to allow a publisher an exquisite level of control over a book or a song or a movie in the hands of a consumer. Trusted PC users might spend $1.95 for a single viewing of the latest Disney animated feature, or they might pay a similar amount for three listens of U2's most recent single. Security, stability, reliability -- and control.
Users may buy a trusted PC even if it won't show a digital video lent by a friend, because it will act less like a temperamental computer and more like a crash-free super-VCR -- like the just-released Microsoft X-box. But in the process of "improving" our PC's, the manufacturers and their partners will be able to determine what software will and won't be allowed to run, what we can and can't do with the information to which we're exposed, and what data about our online activities will be collected and sent to the manufacturer or content provider to assist in future marketing.
Apart from manufacturers' desire not to define the uses of a PC too narrowly, the public interest in flexible computer platforms and open data exchange remains almost entirely absent from this debate. Disney and its cohort are free to view PC's as delivery systems for Mickey Mouse and friends -- and to make their content available through broadband. But it's an entirely different matter to re-engineer the PC so it becomes simply another appliance.
The PC platform and the Internet to which it connects is the engine of the information revolution -- as important to our economy and culture as all the movies in Hollywood. A shift from open platforms to closed appliances may be inevitable, as our consumerist desire for trustworthy PC's dovetails with information providers' obsession with control. But we should beware the haste with which some would sacrifice flexibility for control. If we can't at least temper this taming of the chaotic PC, the victims will be competition, innovation and consumer freedom.

HEADLINE: Mexican Drug Lord's Arrest Helps Fox as He Awaits Bush 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 10 

 BODY:
The legend of the Arellano Felix drug gang is written in blood all over Mexico. 
 They killed for business and pleasure, often taking lives at random. Their bullets killed the Roman Catholic cardinal in 1993. They killed eight infants and children to settle a score in 1998. 
 But one death among many -- the killing of Pepe Patino -- may have been the beginning of the end for the gang, Mexico's most violent and powerful drug cartel.
Twenty-three months ago today, Mr. Patino, the Mexican drug prosecutor most trusted by his American counterparts, left a San Diego safe house with two colleagues and crossed the border for a morning meeting in Tijuana. Thirty-six hours later, their bodies were found in a desert ravine.
"We loved Pepe," said an American drug-enforcement official. "That was the last straw." American and Mexican officials, vowing revenge, redoubled their efforts to break the Arellano Felix cartel.
On Saturday morning, in a law-enforcement coup with great potential rewards for the government of President Vicente Fox, their efforts finally paid off. Mr. Fox will play host to President Bush next week, and his stature will be bolstered by the arrest of Benjamin Arellano Felix, 49, the chief of the gang and the "top priority" of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration, said its chief, Asa Hutchinson. 
Mexican commandos, armed with intelligence from the United States and bolstered by a new and growing trust between Mexican and American counternarcotics forces, burst into a house in Puebla, on a street called Cerrada Escondida, or Hidden Dead-End. 
There they found Benjamin Arellano Felix, a sheaf of $100 bills and an altar with flickering candles in memory of his brother, Ramon. The Mexican authorities now say they are sure that Ramon died in a shootout on Feb. 10, though his body has disappeared. 
From humble beginnings as two-bit liquor and cigarette smugglers, the Arellano Felix brothers -- Benjamin was the brain, Ramon the brawn -- shipped tons of Colombian cocaine and Mexican-made methamphetamine every month, feeding a seemingly insatiable demand in the United States. 
They pierced the border with ships, airplanes, trucks and tunnels, including a 1,200-foot underground railroad. They laundered their cash into networks of legitimate-looking business and real-estate ventures, American officials said, while paying millions of dollars in bribes a month to police officers, prosecutors, judges and politicians.
Mr. Hutchinson called the arrest of Benjamin Arellano Felix "extraordinary work." He lavished praise on Mr. Fox, whose popularity has been ebbing in Mexico for want of concrete political and economic accomplishments, but who now may be able to win political concessions he has been seeking from the United States. 
The arrest may end the annual ritual of "certification," in which the United States judges Mexican drug-enforcement cooperation. Mr. Bush is pressing the Republican-controlled House to approve a limited amnesty for Mexican migrants, and promises of economic development assistance for Mexico may flow from the White House as well.
For years, American officials publicly despaired about the Arellano Felix gang's grip on Mexico. A typical assessment came from a former D.E.A. administrator, Thomas Constantine: "They have become more powerful than the instruments of government in Mexico." 
The gang's power extended far beyond their Tijuana headquarters. In Peru, the now-deposed security chief Vladimir Montesinos brokered the sale of 18 tons of cocaine to the gang. In Colombia, they bartered guns and money for drugs from the rebels fighting the government. Gangs loyal to the cartel moved their drugs on the streets of scores of American cities and towns.
Their influence was reflected in the first official reports of the death of Pepe Patino: "A tragic traffic accident," said a state police commander. 
In fact Mr. Patino was kidnapped, tortured and killed, his skull crushed by a pneumatic press. He was betrayed by a fellow law-enforcement officer, one among hundreds in Tijuana taking payoffs from the gang, a senior D.E.A. official said.
The battle to arrest Benjamin Arellano Felix is over. But in Tijuana today, officials are bracing for a war among the remnants of the gang and their rivals in the one of the world's most lucrative businesses.
"This is a terrific political coup for President Fox, but people here remain fearful of what will come next," said Raul Ramirez Baena, the human rights prosecutor in the attorney general's office for Baja California. "We have seen what happens when one kingpin falls. There are bloody battles, and another one rises in his place.
"The fundamental forces of the drug trade remain intact, particularly the demand for drugs in the United States, and increasingly in Mexico," he said. "As long as there is that demand, there will be drug cartels to feed it." 
The arrest may give Mexicans "new confidence" in the police and politicians, Mr. Baena added. "But we should not lose sight of the fact that Mexican law enforcement agencies are infiltrated with corruption." That will not change overnight, he said, not even after a night that brought what Mr. Fox called "a grand triumph" for the forces of law in a long-lawless land.

HEADLINE: City's Financial Wishes Bow to Albany's Command 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

 BODY:
In a $42 billion -- that's with a b -- budget, the $62 million -- with an m -- that would be collected by raising the city's fines for illegal parking is picayune. But the city cannot take even that tiny step toward solvency without asking permission.
 Nor can it offer its own employees early retirement or restructure its own debt. It cannot lower speed limits on some roads. It cannot even do something New York counties can: decide what time the bars close. For all of those things, the mighty city must go, hat in hand, to Albany. 
 This year, the city's requests are all the more urgent because of what Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg projects will be a $4.76 billion budget gap. Alongside the larger, attention-grabbing items like mayoral control of the schools, there are much smaller favors that must be wheedled out of Albany's byzantine legislative maze.
"The list is shocking because so much of it seems like stuff that's appropriate for local control," said Richard D. Emery, a civil rights lawyer who is familiar with the inner workings of New York's government bodies. "The mayor ends up being responsible in the perception of the public, but not in control."
The city is, of course, a creature of the state. But where some states give cities a wide range of powers, New York City, whose budget is bigger than all but those of eight states, has little autonomy, a fact that has long frustrated city leaders and government scholars alike. 
In the 1970's and 80's, the state blocked Mayor Edward I. Koch's plan to require that police officers and firefighters live in the city. In 1991, at the peak of the city's crime wave, when Mayor David N. Dinkins wanted a tax surcharge to pay for more police officers, he had to beg the state. Next year, Mr. Bloomberg may need a by-your-leave if he wants to charge tolls on the East River bridges. 
The state has never suffered from excessive sympathy for the city. The prevailing attitude in Albany is that New York City is a money pit, and an expensive one at that, said Richard Briffault, a Columbia Law School professor who specializes in local government. "What they don't realize upstate is that the lion's share of the tax revenue comes from the city. So we're shipping a lot of money to Albany and then struggling to get it back."
But the struggle will be easier in a year when all of Albany, including the governor, is running for re-election, and the sympathy factor for the city is at a high, said William Cunningham, the mayor's communications director. "You work with it," he said. "You have a lot of allies. If you can convince them that what you're doing is in the best interest of the city, they will support you." 
This year, the report outlining the mayor's budget agenda in Albany reads like a novel of withholding and betrayal -- not emotional, but fiscal. In 1999, it points out, the state repealed the city's commuter tax, which raised about $500 million a year. Last year, the state abruptly broke a decades-old promise involving the stock-transfer tax worth $114 million a year to the city. 
The state's authority is hidden in many pockets of the law. When the city wanted to build a stadium for the Brooklyn Cyclones, a minor league baseball team, laws governing the use of parkland made the state the gatekeeper. The parking fines and speed limits are governed by the state's Vehicle and Traffic Law. The Bloomberg administration is not yet sure if it will need permission to charge tolls on East River bridges. 
But while the state has tremendous legal authority, experts point out, the city is not powerless. A large chunk of the Legislature, including a majority of the Assembly's Democratic majority, is from the city -- even though those lawmakers have not always hewed to the mayors' agendas. 
And much depends on diplomacy. Already, Mr. Bloomberg has shown his skill at coaxing favors where obligation does not exist. If the state has been shortsighted regarding the city in recent years, said Frank Mauro, director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, it was partly due to prickly relations between Mr. Bloomberg's predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani, and those who make decisions in the capital.
But the city's trump card is that the state cannot afford to let its economic engine collapse. "The mayor of New York, unlike other local executives, has a huge microphone," said Alan G. Hevesi, the former city comptroller. "No elected official in the state wants to be blamed for bad conditions in the city."
But voters do not necessarily realize who is holding the purse strings, or, for that matter, who is making the rules. In 1997, some city residents were startled, and then incensed, to learn that Albany controlled the fate of rent stabilization. The subway, the airports, medical care -- are all to at least some degree out of the mayor's control. "A lot of the major activities of daily life in New York City are not controlled by the city; they're controlled by the state," said Mr. Briffault, the Columbia law professor.
Some argue that the state has sometimes provided a necessary check on the city. When Staten Island voted to secede, for example, it was the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, who is from Manhattan, who made it impossible -- by declaring that the City Council would have to send what is called a home-rule message to the state requesting the secession. When, after Sept. 11, Mr. Giuliani wanted to run for a third term, it was opposition in Albany -- again led by Mr. Silver -- that stopped him.
At times, the city has hidden behind the state's authority as a way of dodging responsibility. Some council members argued, for example, that the city did not have the authority to enact its campaign-finance regulations. Gerald Benjamin, a state government scholar and the dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at SUNY College at New Paltz, says some of that tendency may be at work now, because the state is sometimes more likely to give the city the license to raise revenue than to provide cash assistance. Mr. Bloomberg has said that he will not raise taxes.
"My private view is that Bloomberg wants someone to throw him in the briar patch," Professor Benjamin said. "In other words, force him to tax."
But other experts said that Albany had yet to grasp the urgency of the city's fiscal problems this year. It would be easy, Mr. Emery said, for the city to revert to the crime-ridden, broken-down metropolis it was just a decade ago. "Unless they act now, it's going to be too late," he said. "The specter of a bleaker, darker New York City is already on us."

HEADLINE: Putting City Hospitals on Firmer Footing 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Since Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is looking to cut more than $4 billion from the city's budget, now is perhaps not the most logical time for a city commissioner to be talking about expanding services. But that appears to be the central goal of Dr. Benjamin K. Chu, the city's new Health and Hospitals Corporation president.
 When Mr. Bloomberg chose Dr. Chu to take over the city's hospital system, he set up the first smooth transition in a decade for the corporation, where leaders had left under fire or in a fog of scandal, usually only to be replaced by other short-timers. 
 Dr. Luis R. Marcos, the corporation's longest-serving president, stepped down in January after a six-and-a-half-year tenure, during which he staved off Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's efforts to privatize the corporation and balanced its budget with less financial help from the city.
But now, as the corporation faces its second straight year of losses and a continuing stream of uninsured patients, Dr. Chu is making the remarkable decision to add programs and try to improve service at the corporation's 11 hospitals and 85 community clinics.
Rather than focus on where to cut, Dr. Chu plans to push for a bigger market share in various areas of care and to attract and keep paying patients by adding new clinical services backed up by aggressive marketing, much as the city's private, nonprofit hospitals have done for years. A result, he hopes, will be increased revenue.
"The truth of the matter is," Dr. Chu said in a recent interview, "there are a lot of services needed in the community and it is up to us to help them get them." He added, "If you cut and cut and you don't build services, you miss out on not only providing services but also on possible revenue providers that help support the mission of the hospitals."
After several years of operating in the black, the city's hospital system ended its last fiscal year with a $72 million deficit, and is set to finish the current fiscal year about $200 million short. The corporation shares many of the same woes as the rest of the hospital industry -- reduced reimbursement rates from managed care companies, smaller government subsidies and a decrease in the number of patients, who now get more of their care in outpatient settings. 
But New York's public hospital system -- the largest in the nation -- also serves the largest share of the city's uninsured patients, many of them ineligible for any public insurance program. Roughly 10 percent of patients at the hospitals and 30 percent at the clinics have no insurance.
By making a concerted effort in the last few years to enroll more eligible patients into Medicaid -- the system's uninsured patients fell from 560,000 in the 2000 fiscal year to 490,000 in 2001 -- and by cutting costs throughout the system, the corporation managed to stave off greater losses. A new government insurance program, Family Health Plus, which will insure many families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid, will further help the corporation.
However, this will not fully offset notoriously low Medicaid reimbursements at its clinics or the cost of serving illegal immigrants and other patients who do not qualify for insurance. Additionally, with the mayor's proposed budget calling for nearly a $40 million reduction in city payments for certain of the corporation's services, the hospital system is still facing major financial trouble over the coming fiscal year. 
Dr. Marcos, the previous president, was constantly frustrated by reminders from advocates for the poor and uninsured that his system had a mission to care for those in need -- it was politically impossible for him ever to close an underused hospital or shutter a medical clinic -- coupled by his inability to wring more cash from Albany or Washington. "The toughest challenge is to convince people that the wonderful mission of the corporation costs money," Dr. Marcos said recently. 
In cutting about 30 percent of the corporation's work force, paring services and leaning on hospital administrators to find efficiencies, Dr. Marcos managed to keep his balance sheet under control, but did not necessarily improve the reputation of the hospitals' clinical services, or please advocates. "If you want to do a great job here, you have to be willing to take risks and burn bridges," he said recently. "That is why in part I am now unemployed."
Dr. Chu, who, the son of Chinese immigrants, used the public hospitals as a child, said he was now charged with improving them. This includes adding badly needed services and reducing the emergency room waiting time that upsets patients and often causes them to never return to a public hospital. "I always tell people that we need to treat patients like you want your mother to be treated," said Dr. Chu, who has spent much of his career working with the corporation. 
Before his appointment as president, he was senior associate dean at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, where he managed the university's contract with Harlem Hospital, which is part of the corporation's system. He also had several management positions in the corporation, was once acting New York City health commissioner and served on various medical faculties.
Among the initiatives that Dr. Chu believes the corporation should be adding are screening programs for colon cancer and for cardiac diseases, allowing earlier detection of problems and more referrals to the public hospitals for treatment. Although a large percentage of patients in the public clinic system fall into groups that suffer from heart disease, very few such patients opt to get treatment at public hospitals. "We are not out there trying to intervene," Dr. Chu said. "I can't say there is any area of services I want to cut back on."
How to pay for all this? Like executives at the private, nonprofit hospitals, Dr. Chu believes that public hospitals need advertising campaigns for their services as well as fund-raising efforts that appeal to wealthy donors. If other hospitals can give naming rights to wings of their centers to those with deep pockets, why not the city's hospitals, he reasons, which is in keeping with the Bloomberg administration's desire to forge private/public partnerships. 
Dr. Chu said he would also personally lobby for increased reimbursements from the government insurance programs, and look carefully at how the corporation does its billing, to make sure it is doing all it can to collect its fees. 
Mr. Chu will almost certainly be judged by Mr. Bloomberg, who is deeply interested in public health, in balancing the mission of the public hospitals with the fiscal realities. "Dr. Chu is a good physician with a very big heart," said Dr. Marcos, who once taught Dr. Chu. "He is into new programs and improving outpatient care, which needs improvement. At the same time, I will say he will have to work very hard to maintain the financial structure of this corporation."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA GIANTS: OVERVIEW: THE CORPORATE STRATEGY; 
Eye on Profits, Murdoch Focuses on Details

BYLINE:  By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Rupert Murdoch, whose name is virtually synonymous with that of the company he runs, the News Corporation, is known in the media world as a man of big ideas.
 Two decades ago, he reached beyond his chain of Australian newspapers to buy The Times of London and soon took on Britain's powerful labor unions, moving the paper to profitability. Later in the 1980's, he successfully created the Fox network, the United States' first new commercial broadcast network since the early days of television. 
 In the 1990's, he bet successfully on satellite TV in Britain and Asia. He created Fox News in 1996 when CNN, the hegemon of cable news, seemed to reign unchallenged. Now, Fox News is winning that battle. 
But investors have long worried that Mr. Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of the News Corporation, cared far more about the birth of his brainchildren than about delivering the steady earnings that sustain Wall Street. While most of Mr. Murdoch's plans have paid off in the long run, they have at times depressed the company's financial results for months or years. He has routinely brushed off those concerns.
But not these days. Not with the advertising market still lackluster. Not with his company's operating profits in decline. And not with losses mounting at the Fox broadcast network. 
In an interview last week, a different, almost cautious Mr. Murdoch emerged, one without grand plans and, instead, with a focus on operational details. "Just watch our earnings grow," Mr. Murdoch said when asked about his message to Wall Street. What about his next move? "We don't have one," he said. "We just think this is a very good time to be building and polishing and working on our existing assets, improving their competitive positions and improving their earnings. We want to improve our earnings per share from the assets that we have."
Given Mr. Murdoch's history of deal making and high-risk investment, it may be difficult to believe that he can sit still for long, especially now when many media companies seem intent on growing bigger. In fact, he would be trying to complete a $22.5 billion acquisition right now if EchoStar Communications had not outbid him last fall for General Motors' Hughes Electronics unit, which includes the DirecTV satellite television company, with an offer of $26 billion. It would surprise no one if Mr. Murdoch announced some other big deal. But Mr. Murdoch may be keeping his powder dry these days because he has been here before: his company came close to a bankruptcy filing in the last global recession a dozen years ago.
"We learned our lesson," Mr. Murdoch, chuckling ruefully, said at the operational headquarters of the News Corporation on Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan..
In the last recession, Mr. Murdoch was caught out of position because he was financing much of the company's working capital needs with short-term bank debt. When the bank financing dried up, the company neared the brink.
Mr. Murdoch pulled through. But when the economic storm clouds gathered a few years ago, he said, he battened down the financial hatches by moving the company's debt to long-term bonds. Even though the company must pay higher interest rates, the loans will not come due for many years. "We said the moment we can move all our debt to public debt, even though it costs 7 percent, 7 1/2 percent, 7 3/4 percent, as against bank debt at 5 percent, we'll pay the difference, thank you," he said, pounding his coffee table. "Sleep better. Be in better shape. And that's where we are now."
Wall Street is starting to buy it, literally. Because the News Corporation derives nearly a third of its revenue from the United States advertising market, the company, along with Viacom, appears to be especially well positioned to benefit from any advertising rebound. The News Corporation's shares have increased about 20 percent the last two weeks, closing on Friday at $29.87.
"It's probably safe to say that while we're not as obsessive about our stock as the guys who are down there on Times Square, it is something we do care about," said Peter Chernin, the company's chief operating officer, referring to Viacom and its chairman, Sumner M. Redstone. 
Despite the News Corporation's $4 billion deal to acquire Chris-Craft Industries and its 10 TV stations last year, the company is selling some money-losing assets and units that can fetch a good price. It sold the Fox Family television operation to Walt Disney last year for about $5.2 billion in cash and assumed debt, a deal widely viewed as a coup for the News Corporation. Now, Mr. Murdoch is trying to sell out of major failed investments in Italy and Germany.
He still has work to do. The advertising recession has hurt most big media companies, but the 2001 finanical results of the News Corporation were especially ugly. (The company's fiscal year ends in June, but the following figures are for calendar years.)
Revenue was essentially flat at about $14.23 billion, while operating income fell nearly 12 percent , to $1.57 billion in 2001 from $1.78 billion in 2000. 
Operating income fell at four of the company's six principal units.
. At the newspaper division, which has been the company's financial foundation, operating earnings fell 17.1 percent. Lachlan Murdoch, Mr. Murdoch's oldest son and heir apparent, who oversees the division,, said that its sole United States newspaper, The New York Post, had a significant increase in circulation but was still losing money.
The biggest drop, however, was at the TV group, which includes the Fox network, the company's local television stations and its Asian satellite operation. At the television division, operating earnings fell 25 percent, to $446 million, last year, from $595 million in 2000. That drop would have been even bigger without the Chris-Craft stations. 
The company's star division, however, was its constellation of pay-TV channels, which include regional sports networks, FX, the Speed Channel, the National Geographic Channel and, most prominently, Fox News. Operating income at that unit jumped about 11.7 percent, to $115 million from $103 million the previous year.
Mr. Murdoch's team appears to be spending more time thinking about the United States television market than about anything else.
Much of the reason for that focus is that the company's failure to win DirecTV has left the News Corporation a spectator rather than a participant in the consolidation of pay-TV distributors in the United States.
If the Comcast Corporation's pending acquisition of the AT&T cable business goes through and if EchoStar's acquisition of DirecTV is approved by regulators, six companies -- none of them the News Corporation -- will serve more than 80 percent of the nation's homes that pay for television. Each of those companies wants to pay less to the producers of cable channels, including the News Corporation.
"As someone providing or trying to provide a variety of channels," Mr. Murdoch said, "we, and I think everyone else in a similar position, is concerned at the strength of the gatekeepers."
Mr. Chernin described the company's relationship with cable and satellite carriers in more pointed terms, calling it "the critical question which we're sort of working through."
A federal court in Washington last month overturned rules that barred one company from owning a cable carrier and a broadcast TV station in the same market, opening the way for the News Corporation to acquire a major cable company. But Mr. Murdoch and Mr. Chernin suggested last week that there were no available cable companies worth buying. 
For now, the News Corporation's attempts to gain leverage with the gatekeepers may be limited to variations on the televison industry's standard tactic of using popular networks to gain access for new services. Mr. Chernin, for instance, could try to induce a cable company that needs one of the Fox regional sports networks to also take FX.
For the News Corporation, it is also important to wield the influence of strong local broadcast stations and a strong broadcast network in such talks. If the local cable company will not cooperate, the News Corporation can threaten to withhold the right for the cable carrier to transmit the signal of a local station owned by Mr. Murdoch's company. 
The News Corporation's 33 local stations, most of them Fox affiliates, are doing relatively well. Even though their earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fell 11 percent last year, they remain the most profitable of all of the company's operations.
But Mr. Chernin said that the company did not intend to acquire many new stations, even though regulators appear to be likely to relax rules restricting the number of stations that one company may own.
"We have no interest in going and buying another 10, 20, 30, 40 television stations," he said. 
The company might, however, try to buy a second station in major markets where it now owns only one, like Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia. (The company already owns two stations in New York, Los Angeles and five other cities.)
The big problem is the Fox network. "It's been a bad season," Mr. Murdoch said bluntly. Poor performances by former hits like "The X-Files" and "Ally McBeal" have dragged down Fox's ratings. Sandy Grushow, the network's president, said he was hoping for a lift from new shows next fall by the creators of "Ally McBeal" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," as well as from the summer debut of "Pop Idols," a star-search program in which viewers vote for their favorites among young new entertainers.
Mr. Murdoch could use a new hit to help him forget the "surprise, shock and deep disappointment" he said he felt last Oct. 28, when the company came up short on DirecTV.
Knowing the battle was lost, Mr. Murdoch retired that evening to his apartment in the SoHo section of Manhattan with perhaps a dozen family friends. They watched "Shallow Hal," a Fox film comedy about a man who only sees the inner beauty in people. "It wasn't such a compelling film," he said, "that it got our minds off it."

HEADLINE: Political Memo; 
'Recession' Won't Tarry To Run With Democrats

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 10 

 BODY:
The recession is fading away, and with it, perhaps, the best chance Democrats had to dent President Bush's wartime popularity and put Republicans on the defensive for the Congressional elections in November.
 Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told Congress on Thursday that the recovery appeared to be "well under way," a judgment that other economists concurred with. 
 The downturn now seems to have been so brief and mild -- it started a year ago but encompassed only one quarter in which the economy contracted -- that economists are debating whether it was a recession.
The improving outlook means the economy is less likely to be a big issue come fall. If the Democrats cannot link Mr. Bush and the Republicans to hard times, the conventional political wisdom is that they no longer have a unifying theme for their effort to take control of the House in November and make Mr. Bush vulnerable in 2004. 
"Democrats obviously can pick around the edges with the failure of environmental policy and health care policy and the more standard issues they have," said Leon E. Panetta, the former Democratic congressman from California who was White House chief of staff in the Clinton administration. "But if they can't take Bush on directly on the economy, they lose a big issue."
Recessions can wreak havoc on parties in power. That was seared into Mr. Bush's thinking by the experience of his father, who was defeated in 1992 after Bill Clinton cast him as out of touch with the difficulties of working people during the slump that ended in 1991.
But the rule for presidents has always been that if you must lead through a downturn, get it out of the way early. Ronald Reagan weathered a 16-month recession in 1981 and 1982 but had put it behind him when he faced voters again in 1984.
For Mr. Bush, there are encouraging signs, among them the news that unemployment dropped in February for the second month in a row, to 5.5 percent. That suggested that he might be spared the phenomenon that dogged his father's re-election campaign: that unemployment typically continues to rise for months after a recession technically ends.
But White House officials made clear last week that they were not going to proclaim economic victory. They said Mr. Bush had decided to continue emphasizing that times were tough for many families, whatever the numbers said. 
His judgment is based on what he feels, they said, but also reflects a belief that there is more political gain from being closely tied to working people than from embracing the latest quarterly growth number.
Dan Bartlett, the White House communications director, said Mr. Bush and the administration "remain cautiously optimistic." 
"But the psychology of the electorate is going to lag for some time to come," Mr. Bartlett said. "So it's going to be very important for the administration and those running for office in the fall to show a focus on the economy. It will remain the focus of our message for the year, for our activities, for our venues and events and the policies we promote."
The strategy was on display last week when Mr. Bush put aside his free-trade principles to help steelworkers by imposing tariffs on imported steel. It was evident again on Friday when he visited a company in Florida that had made it through the downturn without layoffs, and had sweetened its pension plan. But even with the good economic news, Mr. Bush was subdued, saying he was not much interested in what "the bean counters" were saying.
"So long as somebody lost a job, I'm worried about it," he said.
In policy terms, the end of the recession could scramble the outlook. The Congressional Budget Office signaled last week that the recovery could help restore the surplus. Should Congress and the administration again have a pot of money, it would no doubt lead to an intensified debate over more tax cuts versus more spending on social needs.
Some analysts said a quick economic turnaround might even turn out to be good political news for Democrats by allowing them to highlight differences with Republicans over issues that would remain in the shadows if people were concerned simply about keeping their jobs. They said Democrats would benefit from a clean fight over further tax cuts or providing help for retirees in paying for prescription medicine -- or tax cuts versus more money for education or the environment.
"The economy is not working for the Democrats," said Charles E. Cook, who analyzes Congressional races. "People don't blame the recession on Bush, and they don't blame the budget deficit on his tax cut. If they're not getting any traction from it, why would the Democrats want the recession prolonged?"
It has been striking how little Mr. Bush and his party have paid for the recession. Polls show that voters have given Republicans slightly higher marks on the economy since the recession began. The percentage of people saying the country is on the right track has risen and remained high since the Sept. 11 attacks, and Mr. Bush's popularity ratings, while down a bit since fall, remain around 80 percent.
Democrats, analysts said, must shift the domestic political agenda back to the social issues that were in the forefront before the attacks.
"I would argue that what the Democrats need is for the economy to get better quickly so the spotlight can go back to the issues that Democrats usually do better on," Mr. Cook said. 
Democrats are signaling that they want to focus the fall elections on adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and fighting Republican efforts to allow workers to invest part of their Social Security taxes in the stock market. They said the Enron scandal should allow them to make the case that only Democrats can be counted on to make sure big business does not run roughshod over the interests of the little guy.
"The recession wasn't and isn't a domestic political issue," said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster. "But there are economic issues that are quite important to voters that have to do with the cost of living, particularly related to health care, and with retirement security. If anything, those concerns have gotten deeper in recent months."

HEADLINE: Chief of Global Crossing Faces Grind ofSalvage 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO and GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
John J. Legere, the chief executive of Global Crossing, acknowledges that trying to salvage the company "may be the toughest job for any C.E.O. in the world right now," as he put it in an interview on Friday. 
 While Global Crossing grapples with contentious bankruptcy proceedings and government investigations, the job may be particularly tough for Mr. Legere, who is deeply entangled in the legacy of corporate practices that often seemed to benefit the people at the top of the company much more than its shareholders. 
 It became public knowledge last month, for example, that the company's Asia Global Crossing subsidiary had forgiven him the $10 million balance of a $15 million interest-free loan just weeks before the bankruptcy filing. And now, on closer scrutiny, it turns out that the arrangement was even more lucrative for him than was initially apparent because Global Crossing is also paying the millions of dollars in taxes that Mr. Legere would otherwise have to pay on that income. 
"They call it a loan, but I would call it a gift," said Nell Minow, editor of The Corporate Library, which monitors corporate governance issues. "It is not unheard of, but it is a bad practice. It is just a cherry on top of the sundae of compensation."
Mr. Legere, who had been chief executive of Asia Global Crossing, also became chief of the parent company in October, after the resignation of Thomas Casey.
Shortly after taking his new post, Mr. Legere was criticized for leading an effort to merge Global Crossing with Asia Global Crossing, its largest subsidiary, in a plan that would have given Global Crossing full control of its Asian unit's network and available cash. The idea was abandoned after Asia Global Crossing shareholders cried foul.
Mr. Legere stepped down as chief of the Asian unit in January and resigned from its board last month. 
Mr. Legere, a former high-ranking executive at Dell Computer and AT&T, has known little peace since taking the top job at Global Crossing -- a company undone by the telecommunications recession and its own capital-intensive ambitions. Within weeks of the Jan. 28 bankruptcy filing, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the F.B.I. began investigating the company's accounting practices.
Mr. Legere has moved from Hong Kong to work in the company's offices in Madison, N.J. As his wife and two children wait in Los Angeles, he is living in Morristown, N.J.
Each day, his assistants arrive in the office at 5 a.m. to download and send the day's news reports about Global Crossing, which usually discuss the complications of its bankruptcy proceedings, to his Blackberry wireless pager.
"There were some days in the last few weeks when I wanted to pull the cover over my head and go bank to sleep," said Mr. Legere, who typically reaches the office by 8:30 a.m.
David R. Carey, Global Crossing senior vice president for operations, who has known Mr. Legere for more than 20 years, says he is a demanding boss. But Mr. Carey said, "He puts every ounce of his energy into achieving the goal and expects those around him to do the same." 
At least two executives who have worked for Mr. Legere say he is particularly tough. A former Global Crossing executive recalled that Mr. Legere "flew into a rage" when travel constraints made it impossible for that person to attend a meeting across the country the next morning at the time Mr. Legere demanded. 
And a second employee recalled Mr. Legere's calling him at home with questions on a major holiday about a business matter that did not strike the employee as urgent. 
Mr. Legere, who is 43, said he was still optimistic about Global Crossing's chances of emerging from bankruptcy as a contender in the telecommunications industry. He said recent moves to cut costs would allow Global Crossing to operate under bankruptcy protection at least through the rest of this year. 
The company based in Bermuda for tax reasons but managed from an up-to-date office park in Madison, said on Friday that it would cut 1,600 jobs, in addition to 800 employees who accepted a voluntary reduction offer. This will bring its work force to 6,000, compared with 15,000 last year after earlier cuts. The company will also close 71 offices and, among other spending cuts, has cut Mr. Legere's salary of $1.1 million by 30 percent. 
Besides the forgiven loan, Mr. Legere gets to keep the $3.5 million signing bonus received when he joined Asia Global Crossing in 2000. He said those financial incentives had been necessary to to lure him from Dell Computer, where he had been in charge of Asian and European operations. 
About 60 prospective buyers have looked at Global Crossing since its financial adviser, the Blackstone Group, began shopping the company around last month, Mr. Legere said. So far, several companies like the Gores Technology Group, Platinum Equity and the Texas Pacific Group, have shown interest in bidding for Global Crossing, in addition to Hutchision Whampoa of Hong Kong and Singapore Technologies Telemedia, which has made a $750 million offer. 
Mr. Legere, a former long-distance runner from Fitchburg, Mass., said he was "prepared for the grind" as Global Crossing moved forward with negotiations with its banks and trade creditors. 
He said he had told employees to be prepared to hear the "L-word" -- liquidation. But he said that possibility, which would involve shutting down the company and auctioning its assets, was remote as long as he can contain costs.

HEADLINE: Resting Sooner Than Planned 

BYLINE:  By KAREN ALEXANDER 

 BODY:
"IVO THOMAS has retired," says the voice-mail message on his former extension at the Boeing Company. "You can reach him in Bora-Bora."
 Although it is not entirely true, the cheery message, recorded by Mr. Thomas's secretary on his last day of work in late December, makes him laugh. 
 Mr. Thomas, 66, survived nearly two decades of boom and bust as a logistics engineer in the aerospace industry. He had planned to work a few more years but was forced into retirement at the end of last year, a casualty of the faltering economy. Now he is in new territory: at home with his wife, Drahomira, trying to cut back on expenses and figure out how to fill the days he used to spend solving complicated problems in an industry he has always adored. 
"I have mixed feelings," said the Czech-born Mr. Thomas, sitting in his Santa Ana, Calif., apartment, Ms. Thomas, who was also born in Czechoslovakia, by his side. "I wanted to work longer, but on the other hand, I thought maybe some sickness would come. Maybe I would work until I dropped dead or something, so they just made a decision for me."
Barry Green, 63, accepted early retirement last April from his job as an executive vice president at Lippincott & Margulies, a branding and corporate identity consultancy in New York. Mr. Green said that he bowed out two years earlier than he had planned, although he still occasionally consults for the firm and can keep his medical benefits until he becomes eligible for Medicare. 
"I sensed that the economy was weakening, and I didn't need the pressure at that point in my life," Mr. Green said. 
Mr. Thomas and Mr. Green are not alone. As job losses mounted, many older workers say their careers have ended years ahead of schedule. Some were encouraged to accept buyouts. Some were laid off. Others left voluntarily to escape the pressures of a slowing business.
Economists do not yet know whether employees in their 50's and 60's have felt the brunt of recent job cuts more severely than younger workers. But if the last recession is any indication, they have most likely been squeezed out of the work force at least as much as their younger counterparts and will have a much harder time finding new jobs.
In the recession of the early 1980's, men aged 45 to 59 lost their jobs at a rate 40 percent lower than for men 25 to 39, according to a recent study published by the International Longevity Center-USA, a nonprofit research group in New York. But in the recession in the early 90's, seniority did not seem to provide much job security. Displacement rates for older men rose 16 percent from one recession to the next, while the rate for younger men declined 31 percent, making the two groups almost even. Older workers in blue-collar industries suffered the greatest relative change over that time period, according to the study. For women, the rates were nearly constant, with older women faring somewhat better than their younger counterparts.
In the early 90's recession, which closely resembles this recent one, the service industries were particularly hard-hit.
"If employers were laying off older workers in the early 1990's, then it's likely they are going to be doing the same in this downturn," said Marjorie Honig, a labor economist at Hunter College and the author of the study. "What we do know is that older workers -- when they are laid off -- take much longer to find a new job, and the jobs that they do find are at much lower wages."
Official unemployment numbers tend to understate a recession's effect on older workers, according to John Rother, the policy director for AARP, the nation's largest advocacy group for Americans over 50. "In order to be counted as unemployed, you have to be actively looking for a job," Mr. Rother said. "Many older persons who are laid off give up on looking for a new job." 
Mr. Thomas's work at Boeing in Huntington Beach required him to devise ways to move delicate pieces of aerospace equipment, like modules for the International Space Station and the space shuttle program, from the factory to the launching pad. He thought he was able to escape several rounds of layoffs because he did not strive for more prestigious positions, which would have raised his salary and profile. 
"I was just a plain soldier, and this is how I think I survived," he said. "I had a strategy and it worked for 18 years."
In retirement, however, Mr. Thomas's $60,000 annual income will decline by approximately half. (His wife does not work.) 
He does not think he can find a full-time aerospace job at his age, but needs to earn money. Because he speaks seven languages, he is considering starting a tour-guide business, escorting wealthy Eastern Europeans around the national parks. 
He is also looking for a cheaper alternative to his $1,390-a-month two-bedroom apartment, the cost of which has climbed 73 percent since the Thomases moved in nine years ago. His 18 weeks of severance pay will run out in May.
So far, Mr. Thomas said, his days are busy, sorting out paperwork and making financial decisions. "I suspect later we will probably think, What the hell do we do?" he said.
When Mr. Green in New York stopped working, he frequently asked himself that same question. He is unencumbered by the urgent financial worries that plague many retirees, but still the adjustment to a life of relative leisure did not come easily. "It was very difficult for the first couple of months," he said. "I found it very disconcerting."
So Mr. Green, who is single, has filled his days with enough extracurricular activities to elect him student body president. He is taking Italian and medieval history classes. He is a director of Safe Horizon, a nonprofit organization that helps victims of violence and sexual assault and, most recently, of Sept. 11. He joined Artists United, a producers' group that invests in new theater productions. He is also writing a novel.
He keeps up with his former colleagues and splits his time among his homes in New York, Los Angeles and the Berkshires. Nonetheless, he often misses the structure of working life. "There are days that I feel rather blue that I'm not working full time, and there are other days that I am thrilled that I am not in the rat race anymore," he said. 
Mr. Green thinks that his finances have barely been affected by his early retirement. The lucrative bonuses that were a mainstay of his high-six-figure earnings have all but disappeared from the industry this year. Yet he finds himself thinking of ways to cut costs and pare his possessions. 
"The material stuff is starting to matter less and less," he said. "I don't need another sweater or that new pair of shoes. It's just not as important to me anymore."
For Mr. Thomas, the most unexpected change is not being able to pop back into his old office. Years ago, he said, before his unit at the McDonnell Douglas Corporation was bought by Boeing, retirees were given a badge that allowed them to come and go. Not so now.
About two years ago, he said, he and four co-workers who were also nearing retirement age formed a support group. They met at lunchtime to figure out how to plan for retirement. Thumbing the binder of memorabilia and good wishes that his co-workers presented to him on his last day of work, he said: "Maybe I can call them up. We will have another meeting."

HEADLINE: PLANNING; 
Ready to Quit, but Deep in Debt

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
SAVING for retirement is hard enough without being in debt. But more Americans than ever before are finding themselves on the cusp of retirement and in the red.
 "There are an awful lot of people who are in near retirement who aren't ready for retirement," said William D. Novelli, the executive director and chief executive of AARP, the nonprofit advocacy group for Americans 50 years and older. Debt multiplied among older people during the 1990's, he said, even though "the bloom was on the economy." 
 Data from the Survey of Consumer Finances, conducted by the Federal Reserve Board, confirm that among households headed by 55- to 64-year-olds, the average ratio of debt payments to family income grew to 13 percent from 9 percent between 1989 and 1998. Though the Federal Reserve will not report new figures until next January, indications are that a smaller share of families are in debt, but with larger balances.
Credit counselors have also noticed the change. "Generally, we're seeing a larger percentage of older consumers that are closer to retirement," said William P. Cullinan, the interim president and chief executive of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. "They may own a house, perhaps with a mortgage, but they don't have much beyond it."
The most recent Health and Retirement Study, a biennial survey financed by the National Institute on Aging, also paints a less-than-pretty picture. "Looking at 64-year-olds, 14 percent of them have negative net worth," said Michael D. Hurd, the director of the RAND Center for the Study of Aging, which compiles data from the studies. "That's not very good." Indebted people between ages 50 and 64 owed an average of $13,000, he said.
Several factors contributed to the rise in indebtedness among people about to retire, according to researchers and credit counselors. Near the top are changes in living standards. Couples are having children later than usual, a decision that pushes education and housing costs closer to retirement.
Scott M. Kahan, the president of the Financial Asset Management Corporation in New York, said that divorces and remarriages, resulting in second families, often contributed to the delay. People who want to retire, therefore, often resort to a home-equity loan, he said.
"A lot of aspects of retirement planning seem to come upon people quite quickly," said Dawn Lockhart, the director of Consumer Credit Counseling Services in the Jacksonville, Fla., a network of nonprofit agencies. The rush to build savings accounts exposes people to financial risks, she said. Financial planners usually advise people to invest aggressively when they are younger and to become gradually more conservative as retirement approaches. But when big costs are put off until later in life, Ms. Lockhart said, those stages become compressed. 
Taking out loans and investing in risky assets might have seemed like a good idea in the last decade, but now, in a leaner economy with lower stock prices and credit card interest rates creeping higher, families might have serious problems.
The Federal Reserve triennial Survey of Consumer Finances showed that households headed by 55- to 64-year-olds were taking on more of almost every kind of debt in the 90's. From 1995 to 1998, when the economy was strongest, the percentage of those households with installment loans or credit card balances rose to 38 percent from 35 percent and to 46 percent from 43 percent, respectively. The share of households carrying loans secured by their homes, like home-equity loans, rose to 49 percent from 45 percent.
People with such loans may be particularly at risk, Mr. Cullinan said. "When those people run into a problem, suddenly they find themselves in a precarious position, possibly even losing the home." Ms. Lockhart added that the fastest-growing segment of her agency's clientele consisted of people who had a life-changing event and could no longer repay a home-equity loan.
Sometimes fraud is the life-changing experience, Mr. Novelli added. "It turns your stomach to see how many incredibly creative scams there are," he said, to cheat "these people out of their money and their homes."
The ease of credit in the 90's may have also increased financial problems, Mr. Cullinan said. "In recent years, with interest rates having come down so much, literally millions of Americans took advantage of that by refinancing mortgages, frequently taking cash out. Unfortunately, in many of those situations, people didn't fix the underlying issues they should have dealt with."
The recent tumble in stock prices has also made retirement dicey."Obviously, their portfolios haven't been growing," Mr. Kahan said of people who had invested heavily in stocks. "If they have that extra debt that they thought they could grow out of, and maybe pay down over time, that may be an issue because their portfolios aren't what they thought they would be."
Dwindling portfolios have made retirement planning more urgent, Ms. Lockhart said. Clients who were "dramatically impacted by the decline in the stock market" now find themselves facing "a very short time horizon," she said.
Yet many of the indebted who are near retirement have low incomes and never owned stock, Dr. Hurd of the RAND Center for the Study of Aging said. He estimated that only about half of working Americans invested in the stock market during the 90's, even through pension funds. "These people who have negative net worth, the chances are they don't have pensions," he said.
For this group and others, low saving rates may be the deeper cause. "There is a very poor set of savings behaviors in our country," Mr. Novelli said. The generation that fought in World War II had a fine saving ethic, but nothing to save, he said. The baby-boom generation has had plenty to save but no inclination.
Dr. Hurd offered a more economic explanation: low-income people often view saving as a luxury. "We asked people whether they had saved enough for retirement, and got a fairly high fraction saying no." When asked why not, he said, "their typical answer was, basically, their incomes were not high enough."
Entering retirement debt free can mean new habits or postponing the last day of work.
Even with a short time horizon, said Howard D. Leonard, a manager of GreenPath Debt Solutions, a nonprofit credit counseling agency in Queens, families may still be able to recover from debt. Within four or five years, he said, a family that closed its credit card accounts and entered a repayment arrangement could turn red ink to black.
Often, however, older people are reluctant to ask for help. "With more mature consumers, they're probably more likely to suffer in silence," Mr. Cullinan said. "They're afraid to ask for help, or embarrassed to ask for help at their age."

HEADLINE: Berlin, Banking on Its Museums; 
Seeking a New Identity, the City Shakes Up Its Art Legacy

BYLINE:  By ALAN RIDING 

DATELINE: BERLIN 

 BODY:
When Berlin was united in 1990, many Germans were equally united in not wanting this city to become too powerful. Their fears were understandable but have proved unfounded. Berlin is again the German capital, but of a federal republic inoculated against centralism. It has undergone extensive reconstruction, yet it remains poor, with no industry and an insolvent city government. Its problem now is, How can it demonstrate that it really is the new Berlin?
 The answer may lie in old Berlin's one useful legacy. Because culture was a propaganda weapon, both West and East Berlin created huge cultural infrastructures, bequeathing no fewer than 3 opera houses, 8 orchestras, 17 theaters and 17 museums. Maintaining the performing arts became an immense burden to the united city, but the visual arts offered hope: the city's collections were fused, curatorial staffs joined forces, and a reorganization of galleries began. 
 In its search for an attractive -- and nonthreatening -- image, then, Berlin may have at last found a goal. By the end of this decade, it could become a City of Museums. Focused around the Spree River's Museum Island in east Berlin and the Kulturforum just two miles away in west Berlin, a dazzling array of new and refurbished museums are to offer a wealth of art comparable to that found in New York, London and Paris. And the hope is that the rest of Germany will also feel pride. 
"I think it is clear to all Germans that Berlin is a showcase for the nation," said Peter-Klaus Schuster, the director-general of Berlin's 17 state museums. "You cannot impress as a nation with a house of poverty in Berlin. Opera is more of a luxury, but museums are a national heritage. You can debate about closing opera houses, but this nation cannot afford to have ruins on Museum Island."
Mr. Schuster is also making a pitch because, if renovation of the five museums on the island is to be completed by 2009, the federal government will have to foot most of the $1 billion reconstruction bill. Until last year the city was paying half, but an acute financial crisis forced it to withdraw. With the federal government and other regions already covering four-fifths of administrative costs, Berlin's museums will more than ever belong to the nation.
As it happens, Museum Island's five museums, built between 1830 and 1930, were born as national institutions. Indeed, to this day they are described as the State Museums of the Prussian Cultural Foundation. The only oddity is that Prussia disappeared in 1871, its territory successively ruled by a German monarchy, the Weimar republic, the Third Reich and finally a Communist dictatorship, during which the Prussian Cultural Foundation lived on as a West German government entity.
The island's museums also carried the scars of German history. The Nazis stripped them of what was called degenerate Modern art in the 1930's, selling off important works by Picasso, Braque, Klee and others in the West. The museums were then seriously damaged by Allied bombing, with some 400 paintings lost. And of those saved, many ended up in West Berlin. East Germany patched up some of the island's museums and invited Westerners to visit them (and little else).
West Berlin's response was to convert palaces in the Charlottenburg district into museums and to build a New National Gallery, or Neue Nationalgalerie, designed by Mies van der Rohe, on an empty plot near the Berlin Wall. This area, the Kulturforum, soon included a major library, a decorative-arts museum and the Berlin Philharmonic concert hall. When the wall came down in 1989, plans had also been approved to build a Picture Gallery, or Gemaldegalerie, on the site.
"The immediate question was whether it should be built," Mr. Schuster recalled. "It had a winning design, land and a budget, and all this proved too hard to resist, but there was a lot of criticism. The reply of my predecessor, Wolf-Dieter Dube, was that a design, land and money were three gifts from God. The other argument was that, without the Gemaldegalerie, the Kulturforum would be an unfinished project."
The new $140 million museum, designed by Heinz Hilmer and Christoph Sattler along the lines of the Alte Pinakothek in Munich, was finally completed in 1998, and today it houses European art from the 13th to 18th centuries, with works by Cranach the Elder, Durer, Rubens, Rembrandt, Frans Hals and early Italian Renaissance masters among its highlights. But soon after it opened, its future was in doubt.
Meanwhile two new museums filled important holes in Berlin's collections. An abandoned railroad station, the Hamburger Bahnhof, became the Museum for the Present. Built around the private collection of Erich Marx, a Berlin construction magnate, its focus is postwar, with major works by Joseph Beuys, Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein as well as by leading German contemporary artists like Gerhard Richter, Sigmar Polke, Georg Baselitz and Anselm Kiefer.
The Berlin-born art dealer and collector Heinz Berggruen, who fled Hitler's Germany, also brought part of his Modern collection to Berlin. Installed in a large mansion in Charlottenburg around the theme of "Picasso and His Era," it was originally on loan, but most of it was later acquired by the Prussian Cultural Foundation for what Mr. Schuster called the symbolic price of $120 million. The Berggruen Collection, as it is known, has helped replace "degenerate" art lost under the Nazis.
As for the city's major museums, it took much of the 1990's for a consensus to emerge that Museum Island's buildings should be restored and modernized, with Mr. Dube's cautious plan for their use finally approved in January 1999. Then, six months later, Mr. Schuster took over and set in motion a far more ambitious program intended to turn Museum Island into a Louvre on the Spree.
An elegant and affable art historian who wrote his doctoral thesis on "Durer and the Iconography of Humanism," Mr. Schuster, 58, is probably the most powerful museum administrator in the world today. Not only is he director-general of Berlin's 17 state museums, but he is also director of the five museums that come under the umbrella of the National Galleries. And most crucial, as the city's collections are redistributed, he can decide what goes where.
Or, rather, he has already decided that pretty much everything up to 1900 will be displayed on Museum Island, and that includes the Gemaldegalerie's entire collection. Almost all art after 1900 will be at the Kulturforum, with the Gemaldegalerie receiving the Neue Nationalgalerie's 20th-century collection as well as much of Erich Marx's collection from the Hamburger Bahnhof, while Mies van der Rohe's Modernist masterpiece will become a space for international exhibitions. The Hamburger Bahnhof will in turn be given over to contemporary art.
On Museum Island, the first piece fell into place in December with completion of a $62 million renovation of the Old National Gallery, or Alte Nationalgalerie, which first opened in 1876 under the stirring inscription "Der Deutschen Kunst" ("To German Art"). This neo-Classical building has been assigned 19th-century European art, which, with the exception of a score of Impressionist works, means German art. But that includes fine paintings by Caspar David Friedrich, Adolph Menzel and other German Romantics.
The island's museums are also subject to a master plan, drawn up by the British architect David Chipperfield. Its aim is to link the museums so that 4,000 years of art is easily accessible for the price of one ticket. A new entrance building beside the Neues Museum, designed by Mr. Chipperfield, will include the main ticket counters, restaurant, gift shop and bookstore. An underground passageway with its own display of art will run through four of the museums: the Altes Museum, or Old Museum; the Neues Museum, or New Museum; the Pergamon Museum; and the Bode Museum.
Opposite the Bode Museum, East Germany's old Friedrich Engels Barracks will become the Museumshofe, or Museum Yards, with an extension gallery of the Bode as well as space for administrative offices, conservation laboratories, an art library and a new art and culture educational program to be run jointly with the Humboldt University on the nearby Unter den Linden and the Free University in west Berlin.
The Bode Museum and the Neues Museum are now undergoing makeovers, with the Bode due to reopen in 2005 or 2006 and the Neues Museum in 2008. Once the Bode is back in business, it will be the turn of the Pergamon and the Altes Museum, although their planned renovations are less radical; both should be ready by 2009.
"The plan is for a 10-year project costing $1 billion," Mr. Schuster said. "But it may last longer and cost more, say, 14 years and $1.25 billion."
Still, at least the contents of the museums are already decided. The Pergamon, with the great Greek altar that gives it its name, will retain much of its collection and be defined as a museum of ancient architecture. The Neues Museum will present archaeological objects as well as Egyptian and Etruscan sculptures, including the renowned bust of Queen Nefertiti. The Altes Museum, the oldest on the island, will display Greek and Roman art objects on its first floor and hold exhibitions on its second floor. The Bode's paintings will go from Late Byzantine to 1800. And, as now, the Alte Nationalgalerie will cover the 19th century.
Mr. Schuster hopes that, once the shake-up is over, annual attendance at Berlin's 17 state museums will double, to around six million, he said. Already, though, the city's appeal to art lovers goes beyond this official fare. It has scores of other museums devoted to individual artists and themes, while private galleries have multiplied in the past decade. One recent evening, for instance, all Berlin showed up at the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin for the inauguration of a new video work by Bill Viola, "Going Forth by Day."
But the biggest novelty remains the new Jewish Museum. Before its opening last year, the empty building drew more than 350,000 people intrigued by Daniel Libeskind's remarkable zigzag design. Now large crowds are visiting its exhibition of religious objects, paintings, drawings, photographs and films that tell the story of Berlin's once-flourishing Jewish community. Perhaps this museum's popularity alone is proof of a new Berlin in the making.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE OPIUM TRAIL; 
A Village at Source of Heroin Trade Fears the Eradication of Its Poppies

BYLINE:  By AMY WALDMAN 

DATELINE: SANGIN, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
The heroin trade that ends on the streets of Europe and America often begins here, in the Afghan countryside, with luckless tenant farmers like Abdul Hakim.
 "The Americans already bombed Afghanistan, so you might as well destroy the fields, and then you might as well kill me too," Mr. Hakim, 52, shouted in Lear-like rage on a recent day. 
 He was trotting through his poppy field, flinging fertilizer on the livelihood that he was sure his government had come to destroy. His 9-year-old son, one of the 14 children and two wives to be fed, was at his side. 
"People want a lot of money from me," he said, referring to his debts. "I have no choice."
Mr. Hakim's situation is pitiable, but his bankrupt government's is equally so. Donor countries, primarily the United States, have indicated that aid may depend on the destruction of this year's poppy crop. 
Afghanistan's government risks their sanction by turning a blind eye to the crop, but it risks the wrath of men like Mr. Hakim, and those who make the real profit from his labor, by destroying it. Poppies are by far the best crop in much of this drought-parched land.
Like most Afghan poppy farmers, Mr. Hakim last year acceded to the Taliban's ban on poppy cultivation. The strictly enforced ban reduced the opium yield by about 95 percent but also left hundreds of thousands of farmers jobless and hungry. It turned many into refugees, and others, like Mr. Hakim, into bigger debtors. It also turned them against the Taliban.
Last fall, with the Taliban under siege, Mr. Hakim and hundreds of thousands of others rushed into the interregnum with poppy seeds in hand. By the time Afghanistan's new interim government banned poppy cultivation too, in January, the planting had been done.
Now, all across the southwest and east, rows of weedlike greenery have thrust through the mud and dirt. Within two months the plants will be poppies in bloom, topped by capsules heavy with opium resin.
A recent United Nations survey estimated that this year Afghanistan might produce 2,100 to 3,000 tons of opium, heroin's raw material. That is less than the 1999 record of 5,000 tons, but far more than last year's yield.
So now the government must decide whether to eradicate this year's crop and, if it does, whether -- and how -- to compensate the farmers.
The governor of Kandahar, who putatively also rules Helmand and the rest of the southwest, has said the fields will be destroyed without compensation. To compensate would be to bribe, said Kandahar's antidrug chief, Ahmadullah Alizai, 28, not mentioning that there is also no bribe money to be had.
For now, no one seems to have a plan for eradication, no one has the resources and at the local level, it seems, not many have the heart.
Helmand Province produces just over half of Afghanistan's opium. Poppies require about half the water of wheat and yield about 10 times the profit. Farmers with large families and little land say they have no other way to live.
Men like Mr. Hakim do not get rich. For his toil he will come away with nothing except the right to toil again next year. He owes $550, for the food, clothes and other staples he bought during last year's ban, and for the seeds, fertilizer and tractor rental for this year's harvest.
Landowners and opium traders have often made poppy cultivation, which is far more labor-intensive than growing wheat, a condition of access to land and credit. Mr. Hakim's half-acre is owned by his smirking, much younger neighbor, Ahmad Shah, 20, who will take half of Mr. Hakim's yield.
For now, the interim government has banned the buying and selling of opium, which the Taliban left unhindered -- in part, Afghans say, because the mullahs profited from the sales. Under their rule, opium bazaars like the one in Sangin, a dusty market town, flourished. About 200 merchants brazenly sold wet and dry opium, mostly to Iranians cruising through in four-wheel-drive vehicles.
But at the end of February the Karzai government ordered the shops closed down. A week later the only indication that Muhammad Qasem, 35, ever sold anything other than gas burners in his small store were the brown stains over the doorway and the pungent smell inside.
"The men who buy from me will know where to find me," he said. "No one can stop the smuggling until we have jobs, factories, schools."
Just about everyone in this district is tied into the poppy crop. The deputy mayor, a military commander, has an opium shop. The director of education owns two acres of poppy fields. The elders who run the local decision-making council grow poppies too. With the stores closed, they said they would hide their stockpiles and arrange liaisons with buyers in the vast desert or nearby mountains.
It would take uncommon courage to stop the smuggling. The district chief in Nad-i-Ali, Afghanistan's most prolific poppy producing district, was killed recently. The elders heard that he had gone to investigate a report about men transporting opium.
Drug traffickers have long wielded their own cruel power here. In the 1980's and early 1990's much of the poppy crop in Helmand was controlled by a family of strict mullahs led by Mullah Nasim Akhundaza, local people say.
Today, Mullah Nasim's nephew is the governor of Helmand and a close ally of Hamid Karzai, the leader of the interim national government. The nephew, Mullah Shir Muhammad Akhundaza, who is in his 30's, said he did not think the poppies in his territory would be eradicated this year unless someone paid the farmers. Otherwise the people would starve, he said, and turn against him.
Mr. Akhundaza, like every new leader in Afghanistan, is watching his back, and not just because two uncles of his were assassinated. He knows that well-financed drug barons could easily arm dissatisfied rivals. "Next year we will definitely stop," the governor said of his province's poppy habit.
Fear and politics aside, practical exigencies may decide the day.
Abdul Sattar, 27, is the antidrug chief of Helmand Province, theoretically responsible for eradicating up to 100,000 acres of poppies. He works in a totally bare office and has 10 employees but no money to pay them, two Kalashnikovs and no car.
Mr. Sattar was asked what job he wanted in the government and chose this one because he had taken a drug control course in Pakistan -- all of four days, consisting mainly of mullahs saying that people should be told that drugs are against Islam.
"You know the people are compelled to grow these poppy fields," he said. "The foreign community or U.N. should give some money to the farmers."
Mr. Sattar listened as the elders of Sangin described the effects of the drought, now in its fourth year, and of a canal system clogged with silt. All of them were ensnared in a web of debt, they said, their lives like unsolvable word problems.
To get cash, many farmers essentially sell their poppy crops in advance, at about half the rate they would get when harvest came around. That is what Abdul Wahid, 35, did, to get $700 to plant the one and a half acres he rents and to get his wife to a doctor in Pakistan.
At harvest he must give his creditor, a shopkeeper named Abdul Bari, who also is 35, 20 pounds of opium, with which Mr. Bari would double his investment.
"If he doesn't give it to me I'll go the government and have him put in jail," Mr. Bari said, noting in his own defense that he owed $1,166 to a Kandahar shopkeeper for extending him credit.
The stories were all the same. "This year we don't have enough time to cultivate something else," Hajji Masoon said, popping his teeth into his mouth so he would be clearly heard. "Please, this year let us harvest. Next year we promise we won't."
Mr. Sattar listened quietly. "I don't know what to say, or do," he said afterward.
If ordered, he said, he will destroy the fields by force, but he said he hoped that it would not come to that. Like most Afghans, the people in Helmand are well armed. And they are his people; his own brothers have poppy crops.
He said the mullahs' advice -- to tell people that drugs are against Islam -- would not work. The Taliban sowed cynicism, not faith, so the farmers believe that the original ban's only purpose was to allow Taliban or Arabs who had stockpiled opium and poppy fields to cash in.
They knew drugs were bad, but so was hunger. "It is against Islam, it is against human beings, it is against international law, it is against everything, but it is something we have to do," Hajji Abibullah, the watchman at Mr. Sattar's office and a district police chief, said of his own poppy fields.
In truth, said Abdul Hakim, the raging farmer of Sangin, Islam compells a man to do whatever is necessary to feed his family, and so he will. 
A bit down the dusty road, a boy knelt for his afternoon prayers in a poppy field.

DATELINE: SEATTLE, March 11 

 BODY:
Drugstores around the nation are threatening to stop serving Medicaid patients and close or reduce hours if states follow through on plans to cut the amounts paid to pharmacies for filling Medicaid prescriptions.
 Faced with budget problems, more than a dozen states are considering reducing their reimbursement rates under Medicaid, the joint federal-state program that provides health care to 36 million poor people. 
 "This will send a number of pharmacies over the edge," said Ernest Boyd, executive director of the Pharmacists Association in Ohio. "We're not a religion. We're not here for charity purposes. We've got to make a profit or we can't stay open." 
When pharmacists fill prescriptions for Medicaid patients, states pay them the cost of the drug plus a flat fee. But health care costs are soaring even as the recession forces states to cut their budgets. Medicaid consumes 20 percent of the average state budget.
Gov. Gary Locke of Washington has proposed the sharpest cut so far, a $71 million reduction to the $361 million budgeted for the current two-year fiscal cycle.
Other states that have made reductions or are considering them include Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Virginia.
The inspector general for the federal Health and Human Services Department nudged states toward the idea last August with a report warning that they were overestimating wholesale drug prices and overpaying pharmacists by more than $1 billion a year. The report recommended cutting pharmacy payments by about 10 percent. Pharmacy groups attacked the study as flawed.
Representatives of CVS and Walgreens, the nation's largest drugstore chains, with a combined 7,700 stores, said they might reduce hours, close stores and stop expansion in states that deeply cut Medicaid pharmacy payments. Rite Aid and Albertsons said they might drop Medicaid completely in those states.
"We're going to have to re-evaluate our participation in Medicaid," said Karen Rugen, a spokeswoman for Rite Aid, which has 3,600 stores in 29 states. "We believe everyone should have access to medical care. It's just hard to do it below your costs."
Independent drugstore owners are even more alarmed. State health administrators, including Doug Porter, the Medicaid director of Washington, say they do not believe that cuts will devastate pharmacists.
Acknowledging that the intent was to cut the druggists' margins "to the bone," Mr. Porter added: "At least in theory, we should not be putting them below cost. I would be shocked to see any serious number of pharmacies not participating."
State officials said pharmacies should instead drive harder bargains with health plans, wholesalers and manufacturers.
Pharmacists want states to find other cost-cutting options. Many states are encouraging doctors to prescribe less expensive generics. States are also trying to negotiate better deals from drug makers.
Consumers and pharmacists have beaten back some proposals to cut Medicaid pharmacy payments. In Illinois, the Rev. Jesse Jackson led a successful campaign to scale back cuts after Walgreens threatened to reduce store hours in poor Chicago neighborhoods. Proposals in New York and Oregon were also defeated. Indiana pharmacists are challenging a fee reduction in court.

HEADLINE: Keep College Open to the Poor 

 BODY:
The New York State Tuition Assistance Program has propelled millions of poor and middle-income New Yorkers through college since the Legislature created the program a quarter of a century ago. The value of the TAP is obvious, given that people with college degrees earn substantially more over their lifetimes -- and pay significantly more in taxes -- than those who do not. This gospel of economic uplift has generally been lost on Gov. George Pataki, who has tried since his earliest days in office to cut the TAP or reshape it in harmful ways. The governor's most recent idea, to replace part of the TAP grant with loans, is another in a long succession of bad proposals. 
 The TAP offers a maximum of $5,000 in tuition aid to New Yorkers just above the poverty line who attend either public or private college within the state. For state university students, the TAP is capped at $3,400 -- the amount of the tuition. The governor has now proposed withholding a third of a student's TAP aid -- making students take out loans in the interim -- and paying out the final grant only after the student graduates. 
 The Pataki administration describes this as a "graduation incentive" aimed at students who take too long to graduate. This is a red herring, given that students can receive TAP aid for only eight semesters -- or four years -- no matter how long they take to graduate. The loan provision would serve as a disincentive to poor and immigrant families, which often lack knowledge of the banking system and would be fearful of taking on debt in any case. In addition, working adults who often take time off during the course of their education could be found in default and required to repay their loans before they actually finished school.
The loan provision would save $155 million, and the state is facing a large deficit. But anything that drives the poorest students out of college and back into poverty is too high a price to pay.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
After Sept. 11, diverging attitudes about the market.

BYLINE:  By David Leonhardt 

 BODY:
THE passing of a crisis can have one of two effects on people's confidence. It can make them more attuned to the dangers they face, or it can leave them more confident.
 The six months after Sept. 11, during which the economy was declared to be in recession and Enron collapsed, seem to have had roughly opposite effects on individual investors and the professionals who run large stock funds. 
 Individuals have emerged newly optimistic about the market, with many believing that any fall in prices will be temporary and that the market is fairly valued or even undervalued. Institutional investors have become more nervous about the risks of a market that remains near a record high, relative to corporate earnings. 
These are the results of a monthly survey of investor sentiment to be released today by the Yale School of Management. The study's architect -- Robert J. Shiller, the author of "Irrational Exuberance" (Princeton University Press), a bearish book that appeared before the market's peak in 2000 -- calls the survey, which began in 1989, the oldest continuing study of investors' attitudes.
Those attitudes are important because they can help predict where the markets are headed. The optimism of individuals, despite the recent jitters of professional investors, suggests that the coming year could be a good one for stocks.
But the survey can also serve as a reality check. The long run-up in share prices since the 1987 crash has left many investors thinking that any decline will be brief, and the comeback of the market after Sept. 11 confirmed that notion to many people, said Professor Shiller, who teaches economics at Yale. History, however, suggests that share prices can remain stagnant for years.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed yesterday at 1,168.26, up less than 4 points but still enough for its fifth increase in the last seven trading days, as a series of economic reports have suggested the recession is ending. Since the steep market fall just after Sept. 11, the S.& P. index has climbed more than 20 percent. The major indexes are higher than at the close of business on Sept. 10.
Over the same span, the percentage of individuals who say that the market is fairly valued or undervalued has risen slightly, to 62 percent from 58 percent. But based on projected corporate earnings, stocks are more expensive today than they have been for nearly all of the last century.
The most telling change may have come in people's predictions about what will happen after a significant fall in the market. Many economists consider the performance of stocks from one day to the next to be independent.
Absent any other information, however, almost 80 percent of individual investors say the market will rise the day after a big drop, according to the Yale survey. Last summer, about 60 percent offered this optimistic answer. In 1990, less than 50 percent did.
The shift is hardly irrational, given the market's performance after the 1987 crash and 2001 decline. "We've been through a period of 20 years when the market has always rebounded," Professor Shiller said. "People think it's a lesson for the ages."
Their confidence comes despite investors' simultaneous belief, after Sept. 11, that a crash is more likely than it was at any point in the last decade, according to the survey. Individual investors simply think the market will quickly rebound from whatever turbulence that it hits.
The men and women who manage investments are more circumspect and seem to have been more shaken by recent events. The survey does not ask respondents for their reasons, but Professor Shiller said he suspected that individual investors might be concentrating on the patriotic response to Sept. 11, the absence of other attacks and the military successes in Afghanistan. Professional investors, on the other hand, might be thinking about Enron and worrying that many companies have exaggerated profits.
Only 60 percent of institutional investors said that stocks would rise the day after a big dip, down from about 75 percent last summer. About 45 percent of them say the market is not overvalued, down from 60 percent last summer.
The one answer to the survey that recent events did not seem to have changed is the one about what the market will do over the next 12 months. About 90 percent of individuals and 75 percent of professionals said it would rise. A decade ago, 65 percent of both groups believed that.
Today's prediction should go a long way toward fulfilling itself, unless investors decide -- as they did in the 1930's and to a lesser degree in the 1970's -- that their confidence has gotten ahead of itself.
"In the short run, the confidence is holding up terrifically," said Professor Shiller, who remains bearish about the next decade. "In the long run, the outlook is not good."

HEADLINE: Troubles at Arthur Andersen Threaten Times Square Deal 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
Two years ago, the accounting firm Arthur Andersen was the latest corporation to announce it would move its headquarters to a Times Square made safe for families, tourists and even accountants.
 Times Square still abounds with corporate tenants and tourists today, but the troubled Andersen firm is hardly the safe anchor tenant for the 47-story tower that Boston Properties is building on 42nd Street, between Broadway and Seventh Avenue. 
 Andersen is so wounded by the weight of the Enron scandal, a criminal investigation and the loss of clients that it is negotiating to sell itself to another big accounting firm, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. Many business and real estate executives are now betting that Andersen will never move into the new Times Square skyscraper, leaving Boston Properties without a tenant for its $650 million project. 
Although Andersen has not told the company that the deal is in jeopardy, the firm's troubles come at a time when the real estate market has cooled off considerably from 2000, when Andersen signed a lease for half the space in the tower, which is to have 1.2 million square feet of space. According to Cushman & Wakefield, the real estate company, the vacancy rate at prime Midtown office buildings has more than doubled in two years, to 6.7 percent, from 2.7 percent.
"If you're Boston Properties you can't close your eyes and say everything's O.K.," said Peter G. Riguardi of Colliers ABR, the real estate broker. "The market's sluggish. Vacancy rates are up. Rents are down."
"But," he added, "there are not a lot of large blocks of space available in Midtown."
That may augur well for Boston Properties if Andersen bails out of its deal. The tower is not scheduled for completion until early 2004 (when Andersen's lease with its current landlord expires). By then, brokers and analysts say, the market should improve. In any event, corporate tenants now looking for large blocks of space in a new building have practically no other place to go. And despite an increase in vacancies, brokers said rents for prime space have not fallen appreciably. Several law firms have signed leases recently for $65 a square foot or more, about what Andersen agreed to pay at what will be known as Times Square Tower.
"We have a lease with Andersen and we are watching events carefully," said Robert Selsam, senior vice president of Boston Properties. "Whatever happens, we are very comfortable with our development of this great asset, which is the only new building under construction with a large block of available space."
Andersen was forced to sign the deal with Boston Properties after it failed to move quickly to renew its lease at its current home, at 1345 Avenue of the Americas, between 54th and 55th Streets. The landlord, Fisher Brothers, had given Andersen until June 30 to make a decision. When the deadline came and went, Fisher Brothers rented the space to Alliance Capital.
The real estate market was so tight that Andersen had nowhere to go but Times Square, where Boston Properties had been looking for an anchor tenant.
Boston Properties has poured the foundation for the skyscraper on 42nd Street and a pair of tower cranes are beginning to lift the first of many giant steel beams into place. The publicly traded real estate company, which owns 147 properties totaling 40.7 million square feet in several cities, is completing another tower across Seventh Avenue, which will serve as the headquarters for another accounting firm, Ernst & Young. 
The towers in Times Square are 2 of 11 projects the company has under construction nationally.
Jonathan Litt, a real estate analyst at Salomon Smith Barney Inc., recently issued a report suggesting that Times Square Tower may not be quite as profitable as Boston Properties originally thought if Andersen pulls out. Boston Properties should be able to get $65 a square foot in rent, but it had hoped to get more, say $75, for the more valuable top half of the building.
But, Mr. Litt said, even if expectations for a higher rent are not met, the company should have not be seriously affected.
"I'm not losing sleep over this because Boston Properties has time on their side," Mr. Litt said. "They've got two years to find a tenant. I suspect there are some financial institutions in Lower Manhattan that would take the whole building."
That remains to be seen. In the early 1990's, a recession left three new skyscrapers in Times Square without tenants and floundering in bankruptcy court. Morgan Stanley and Bertelsmann AG eventually bought the buildings at about half their construction costs.
Real estate brokers, however, remain optimistic an economic recovery is under way.
"I think the market will be in significantly better shape in the second half of the year," said Bruce Mosler, president of Cushman & Wakefield. "We're beginning to see tenants surface, kick the tires. I think that bodes well."

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ARTS; 
For Theaters and Museums, a Rapid Rebound

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
New York City's major theaters and museums, which suffered a devastating drop in attendance after Sept. 11, have rebounded so strongly that several of them are reaching or exceeding pre-attack attendance predictions and even doing better than they were a year ago.
 Outside the Museum of Modern Art lines are extending down the block on many days, and attendance at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is heavier on weekends than it was last year at this time. The New York City Ballet is within a percentage point of pre-September attendance projections for its "Nutcracker" and winter repertory performances. And for the week ended Sunday, Broadway set box office records for this time of year with revenues up 18 percent and attendance up 6 percent over the same week last year. 
 "Certainly after Sept. 11 we were all terrified this would be the worst winter in commercial theater history and that has not proven to be the case at all," said Todd Haimes, artistic director of the Roundabout Theater Company, which owns the American Airlines Theater on Broadway. "For whatever reason people are coming to New York and people are buying theater tickets, and it's wonderful." 
Almost no one could have predicted such a rapid recovery last fall, when attendance at museums was off by as much as 60 percent and Broadway and Off Broadway were jolted by eerily near-empty theaters and the closings of shows like "Stones in His Pockets" and "A Thousand Clowns."
The effects of the attack along with a flaccid economy and the anticipated box office chill of winter were expected to scare away potential theater investors, prompt wholesale cancellations for the spring and claim even such seemingly permanent Broadway institutions as "The Phantom of the Opera" and "Les Miserables," which depend heavily on tourists.
Instead, 16 shows are scheduled to open on Broadway between now and next fall, and every theater is booked in the spring except one.
Experts, who remain cautious about whether the current vigor can be sustained and expanded, attribute some of the boost to an increase in domestic tourism to the city and to current cultural attractions. The revivals of "Oklahoma!" and "Sweet Smell of Success" with John Lithgow are selling well in previews, and at the Modern two exhibitions are packing them in: the retrospective of the German painter Gerhard Richter and a Sept. 11-inspired photography show called "Life of the City." 
But arts professionals say the upturn is primarily due to multiple efforts, fueled by major advertising campaigns, to draw audiences from the city, the suburbs and the Northeast Corridor to fill the gaps left by the continuing dearth of foreign tourists.
"The New Yorkers are coming," said Jed Bernstein, president of the Broadway-focused League of American Theaters and Producers. And, he might have added, those who live close to them as well.
Michael Malthaner, the music director at Hunter Creek High School near Erie, Pa., for one, said he decided not to cancel his annual trip to New York this May to see shows with his 20-member vocal ensemble. "There is so much culture in New York," he said. "The students don't get that kind of exposure here. I think it's important that we don't fear travel."
Deborah Johnson, vice president of tours and excursions for Hampton Jitney, the bus line that serves the South Fork of Long Island, said her Broadway show trips have been selling out. The tours -- which include lunch, orchestra seats and round-trip travel -- largely draw older Long Island residents from Montauk to Commack. "People are looking for enjoyment," Ms. Johnson said.
The Museum of Modern Art is counting 4,000 to 4,500 visitors a day, double the 2,000 estimate the museum predicted for this period after Sept. 11 and exactly what it was drawing a year ago. This is a big lift from autumn; the museum's attendance was down 40 percent in September.
Perhaps even more remarkably, only one-third of the museum is open, because the rest is under renovation. 
"Local audience has picked up dramatically," said Glenn D. Lowry, the Modern's director. 
The New York City Ballet said it, too, had New Yorkers to thank for a surprisingly strong season. "We are essentially whole," said Christopher Ramsey, the ballet's director of external affairs. Next door in Lincoln Center, business at the Metropolitan Opera, after a post-Sept. 11 drop in ticket sales, has been topping last year's numbers since Jan. 1.
Many cultural institutions attribute their success in drawing New York-area patrons to a shift to local advertising and away from national and international spending. Though arts groups would not give figures for their marketing efforts, many major museums said they were doing a lot of radio advertising, compared with little or none in the past. "We spent an enormous amount of time building our local audience, and that's really paying off," Mr. Lowry said. 
The Metropolitan Museum, where attendance was down 60 percent in September but has been climbing back since, is advertising more heavily in the metropolitan New York region area as well as along the so-called Amtrak corridor to reach people in Philadelphia, Washington and Boston. Philippe de Montebello, the Met's director, recently returned from promoting the Met's shows in Europe, as he typically does each year. But this time, he spoke not only to arts journalists but also to tour-group planners and travel agents. 
The Theater League spent $1 million on a "Season of Savings" promotion in which Broadway shows teamed up to advertise a winter sale that moved 65,000 tickets in three weeks. There was also plenty of help from the government. In December, the city bought 50,000 Broadway theater tickets for distribution for a total of $2.5 million. It is unclear, however, how much of the current attendance record is the result of this promotion. In addition, New York State contributed $1 million for marketing to increase ticket sales through the winter.
The sense that the economy is coming back also helps, arts leaders say, adding that there is still a lingering sense that going to cultural events is a patriotic act, as former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani suggested. Other factors may include warmer weather and more New Yorkers staying close to home.
Beyond all this, they say, is the inexorable pull of daily life, which has helped get people out of the house and back to their previous habits. 
Hotel occupancy rates are also improving. They are down now just 5 percentage points, to 60 percent of capacity, from 65 percent for the same period last year. Experts say the rooms are often being filled by people close to New York, drawn here by culture. "It's the New York community that really propped up tourism after Sept. 11," said Cristyne L. Nicholas, president of NYC & Company, the tourism promotion board. "It's keeping theaters open; it's keeping hotels open."
She and others cautioned, however, that the recovery was fragile and still uncertain in the long run. "Is a New Yorker who's seen 'Phantom' twice going to go back and see it a third time?" she said. 
Looking at the current success, Mr. Lowry of the Modern Museum said: "We've had to scramble to get there. Where a year ago I would have felt a certain confidence, it feels fragile."
Among the reasons is that foreign visitors have yet to return in force, and New York depends on them for the bulk of its tourist revenue. 
Their absence is being strongly felt at the Metropolitan Museum, which has had an attendance increase of 5 percent on weekends, when East Coast residents traditionally come in large numbers. On weekdays, though, when foreign visitors used to be a large part of the crowd, attendance is down 25 percent despite popular exhibitions on Surrealism and on Orazio and Artemisia Gentileschi, the father and daughter artists. 
In addition, many Off Broadway theaters continue to struggle, in large part because they sent out their subscription renewal notices in the week of Sept. 10, later receiving weak responses. 
To help, the Alliance of Resident Theaters/New York, which represents the city's nonprofit theaters, has just awarded $2 million in grants from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to 110 nonprofit theaters with annual operating budgets below $4 million. An additional $500,000 will be awarded by April 15.
Virginia P. Louloudes, executive director of the alliance, said this, along with grants from the Carnegie Corporation, is "going to make it possible for certain groups to get through this year." 
Still, spring is on the way, which many say could bring more good news. "You can only be in a shell for so long before you feel the need to go out, shop, look, see a show," Mr. Lowry said. "Pending some other terrible event, I think people are returning to normal patterns."

HEADLINE: Big Corporations Combine To Negotiate Airline Fares 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 11 

 BODY:
Large corporations, frustrated by the cost of travel from airports dominated by a single carrier, are teaming up in several cities to investigate ways to spur competition and negotiate lower fares.
 The proposals include luring new carriers by guaranteeing corporate bookings; negotiating collectively with the airlines instead of individually to secure lower fares; and setting up air shuttles to frequently visited cities for corporate employees. 
 The efforts are most advanced in Detroit, where representatives of 27 corporations, including DaimlerChrysler, Delphi Automotive Systems and Kmart, met last month to consider alternatives intended to loosen Northwest Airlines' grip on the market. 
Participants at the meeting also included officials from companies based in Minneapolis, where Northwest is based, and Cincinnati, a hub for Delta Air Lines. Combined, the travel executives and purchasing managers in attendance handle $2.5 billion a year in corporate travel. 
"We think more competition in Detroit would benefit Delphi and the other corporations here," said Claudia Piccini, a communications manager at Delphi.
While the group reached no consensus, the meeting "represents a sea change in the level of frustration and concern by corporations" over the state of air travel, said Kevin C. Mitchell, chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which represents corporate and business travelers. Mr. Mitchell's group was the host of the meeting, held Feb. 20 in suburban Detroit. "When the economy started to slow down, companies just took a step back and said, 'enough is enough,' " Mr. Mitchell added.
Detroit is a hub for Northwest, which has more than 70 percent of flights here. A Department of Transportation report last year estimated that Detroit passengers paid 51 percent more for short flights and 21 percent more for international flights compared with passengers in cities where there is more competition and 21 percent more for international flights compared with passengers in cities where there is more competition. 
Regardless, Northwest takes issue with the impression that it dominates the market. Kurt Ebenhoch, an airline spokesman, contended Detroit is a "highly competitive city." About 40 percent of flights from the airport are connections by travelers who are passing through, not flights originating here. And several major carriers have operations in Detroit, including American, Delta, Southwest and Continental, though they have just a handful of flights each day compared with hundreds for Northwest.
The companies' search for alternatives appears to have been prompted by Northwest's decision in December to eliminate corporate discounts on its lowest published fares. Northwest and other airlines routinely gave their biggest customers discounts of 10 percent or more off those tickets, which are meant primarily to lure leisure travelers. 
At the same time, Northwest cut leisure fares by 25 percent and said it would offer corporate discounts on its BizFlex fares, coach class tickets aimed at business travelers, that cost half the full coach fare and do not require a Saturday night stay. Mr. Ebenhoch said those actions resulted in lower ticket prices to many destinations than the companies would receive through the corporate discounts.
"We're not going to offer corporate discounts on already deeply discounted air fares," Mr. Ebenhoch said. "That does not allow us to provide the type of high-frequency, full-service product that allows us to be economically viable." 
Continental, which has a marketing agreement with Northwest, has taken similar actions with shared clients. But other carriers have not followed Northwest's action, a point not missed by the corporations. "They are the only carrier to do it," said Jack Ferry, a Kmart spokesman.
United Airlines does not offer across-the-board discounts with corporations but negotiates individual agreements with each company, said Joe Hopkins, an airline spokesman. Officials at other airlines had no comment.
Participants at the meeting said they were not yet ready to endorse an approach. "We are watching the outcome and keeping our options open," said Ms. Piccini, the Delphi spokeswoman. David Barnas, a spokesman for DaimlerChrysler, added, "Competition is always beneficial to the customer, especially if it leads to better service and lower costs." 
Detroit has a history of aviation activism. In 1998, General Motors and Chrysler signed five-year contracts with Pro Air, a start-up airline that operated from Detroit's secondary airport, City Airport. The airline, which started with three 737 jets, served a handful of cities, including New York, and hoped to expand to two dozen planes by 2003. Instead, the Federal Aviation Administration grounded Pro Air in 2000 because of maintenance problems, and it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. It has not returned to service.
A more successful example of a carrier with corporate partnerships is AirTran. It has developed arrangements with companies and municipalities that have resulted in new service to Biloxi, Miss.; Pensacola, Fla.; and Grand Bahama Island in the Bahamas. On Thursday, AirTran will begin service to Rochester under a deal negotiated with state and local officials.
Kevin P. Healy, vice president for planning at AirTran, said his airline talked to 100 communities a year about starting service. While he says he thinks Detroit has potential for additional carriers, "Northwest is a formidable competitor," Mr. Healy said.

HEADLINE: Air Traffic Is Off Almost Everywhere, but the Dip Is Uneven 

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11 

 BODY:
In the five full months after the Sept. 11 attacks, the number of flights at the nation's 31 major hub airports declined by 12.2 percent from the corresponding period the year before, the Federal Aviation Administration said today. But the drop was much sharper at Kennedy International and La Guardia Airports in New York, Ronald Reagan National here in Washington and Los Angeles International, among others.
 The data are in the aviation agency's annual forecast, being formally issued on Tuesday, which envisions air traffic remaining depressed this year but returning to preattack levels in 2003. 
 The forecast makes three assumptions: continued economic recovery, only small increases in fuel prices and no more terrorist attacks. 
"Clearly we are counting on no further terrorist events of major consequence," said John M. Rodgers, the agency's director of aviation policy and plans. "That is the assumption that we all hope for."
The air-traffic statistics collected by the agency paint a clear picture of a severe but uneven impact from the Sept. 11 attacks.
Affected the worst was Reagan National Airport, which was shut completely until early October and has started up again only gradually. From Oct. 1 through Feb. 28, the period covered in the statistics, National lost 56.1 percent of its commercial operations, and 62.5 percent of all operations, including general aviation and military flights. 
Next-worst was Los Angeles International, which lost 22.5 percent of commercial operations, followed by La Guardia, at 21.1 percent, and Kennedy, at 21.0. The other major airport in the New York area, Newark International, was off 13 percent.
The only gains in commercial operations were the 10.4 percent at Salt Lake City, where the Winter Olympics were held, and 4.2 percent at Minneapolis-St. Paul. Charlotte, N.C.; Cincinnati; Pittsburgh; and Baltimore-Washington International recorded only small losses. But like airports in Los Angeles and New York, others on the East and West Coasts, including those at San Francisco, Boston and Seattle-Tacoma, fared badly.
In the current fiscal year, which began on Oct. 1, the number of people boarding airplanes will drop 12 percent from last year, to 600.3 million, the agency predicted.
While the aviation agency recorded sharp declines in flights by the major carriers in the five months through Feb. 28, it found growth in flights by regional planes, which it defines as those with 70 seats or fewer.
That change is partly attributable to design. Because of cost efficiencies, the large carriers, which in many cases own all or part of regional lines, are shifting business to them, Mr. Rodgers said. Given the current unsettled state of security, the regional carriers face new competition from travelers' cars, and in some cases from rail service. But Mr. Rodgers predicted that regional planes would become more prevalent, quadrupling in number by 2013, to 2,900 from the current 700.
While commercial aviation was suffering after Sept. 11, military flights from the hub airports were not, rising 4.5 percent. General aviation, on the other hand, comprising private planes and corporate jets, dropped 22.7 percent.
The Air Transport Association, which represents the major carriers, said today that losses exceeded $7 billion in 2001, about $4 billion more than had been expected before Sept. 11 because of a recession-related slump in air travel. Airlines parked or retired 350 planes after Sept. 11, the association said, including 101 Boeing 727's, by far the largest category idled.
One result of the retirements is that load factors -- the proportion of seats that are filled -- are expected to rise to 72.3 percent this year, from 71.3 percent last year. Still, the break-even load factor for last year was 77 percent, the association said.
The aviation agency said that despite the slowdown, it believed that traffic would return and that it should press ahead with improvements in air traffic control. "If we delay that investment now, we would just be ruing the day two years from now or three years from now," said Louise Maillett, the agency's acting assistant administrator for policy, planning and international aviation.
At the Air Transport Association, Michael Wascom, a spokesman, agreed that "now is not the time to put everything on the back burner."

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Ads are a weapon in the battle over higher auto fuel standards.

BYLINE:  By Danny Hakim 

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
AN earnest-looking farmer leans on his pickup in a recent print advertisement sponsored by the auto industry. "Farming's tough enough with healthy-size pickups," the ad says. "Imagine hauling feed barrels around in a subcompact."
 Are pickups headed for extinction? 
 The ad, which has appeared in several Congressional publications, is part of the auto industry's nationwide advertising and lobbying blitz against proposed increases in fuel economy standards. Environmental groups are countering with ads of their own, including one that points out that the Model T got better gas mileage than most sport utility vehicles. 
The Senate is scheduled to debate today whether to raise federal fuel economy standards for the first time since the 1980's or turn the matter over to the Bush administration. The recent rush of advertising has concentrated on at least a dozen states with senators that both groups perceive as on the fence, including Delaware, Georgia, Iowa, Missouri, New Hampshire, North Dakota and South Dakota.
Detroit's argument is as blunt as the "Senators, Save Our Trucks!" plea that appeared in one industry ad in The North Dakota Bismarck Tribune. Increased standards will legislate S.U.V.'s, pickups and minivans out of existence, the lobbyists say. They will bring a financial apocalypse, including more than 100,000 job losses. And they will lead to a blood bath on the highways by increasing fatalities by the thousands, they say.
"If these proposals pass, the only place you'll see a light truck is in a museum," said Gloria Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, which sponsored the Congressional ads. 
Farmers would have to do chores with Volkswagen Beetles, according to the alliance ad. One small-business owner worried in another ad that the proposed standards would drive him out of business, though he and the farmer were actually chosen from stock photographs with testimonials provided by the auto industry.
But environmental groups, some senators on both sides of the aisle and even a few officials in the auto industry say that the assertion that trucks would disappear is far-fetched. A television commercial by Franzen & Company of Washington, sponsored by the National Environmental Trust, argues that automakers made many of the same assertions when fuel economy standards were first imposed in the 1970's. The ad cites a quotation from Chrysler in the 1970's that said the first wave of fuel economy regulations would bring about a world of subcompacts. That has not come to pass.
"The auto industry is out there trying to shift the attention away from oil dependence, which they are primarily responsible for, and shift it onto extraneous issues which are not true," said Daniel F. Becker, the director of global warming at the Sierra Club.
Automakers say that they would prefer that the fuel economy issue be handled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, a branch of the Transportation Department. Two of their allies, Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, and Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, have jointly sponsored a bill that would turn the matter over to the traffic safety agency. Mr. Levin and auto executives have argued that the regulatory agency is better equipped to research fuel economy than Congress.
A proposal jointly sponsored by Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, would increase the fuel economy of the average new automobile sold in the United States by about 50 percent by model year 2015. The Kerry-McCain measure would also require new safety standards to make trucks less dangerous to cars.
Senator Kerry has pointed out that since General Motor's former top lobbyist, Andrew Card, is now President Bush's chief of staff, it would be unlikely for the administration to raise fuel standards significantly. The industry's ads are primarily being run by two groups, the automobile alliance and the Coalition for Vehicle Choice, both financed by Detroit. "Save the endangered S.U.V. and pickup," said one ad that appeared in The Manchester Union Leader in New Hampshire. The coalition, which backed the ad, did not return telephone calls to its headquarters. Another ad, which ran in Roll Call, a Congressional publication, said: "Fuel economy is important. But safety is vital."
In a recent automobile alliance radio spot, by the Dan Rosenthal Company, an ad agency in Bethesda, Md., "Sally" complains to her doubting husband, "Joe," that "the government wants to take away my S.U.V."
Joe stammers, "Well, but they say, y'know, who needs bigger vehicles?"
An exasperated Sally responds that "only builders, mechanics, families, farmers, small business, the entire tourism and travel industry, the military, park services, me, your dad. . ." 
Joe, defeated, concedes, "O.K., Sally. O.K."
Environmental groups have fought back. The Model T versus S.U.V. ad, by MacWilliams, Robinson & Partners of Washington, was sponsored by the Union of Concerned Scientists. It ran in Roll Call with the headline "Darwin Would Not Be Impressed." A new bipartisan group, Americans for Energy Security, had a letter in Roll Call signed by politicos like Robert McFarlane, the national security adviser for President Ronald Reagan, and Harrison Ford, who played a president once in the movies.
"Making vehicles more fuel efficient is the single most important step we can take to reduce our dependence on oil," the ad said.
Most political analysts say this latest push to raise fuel standards will be as fruitless as previous ones. Not only would it face a Republican House and White House but getting it out of the Senate is expected to be difficult, despite concerns about dependence on foreign oil. 
But if the Kerry-McCain measure became law, would the S.U.V., the pickup and the minivan really vanish?
Michael Morrissey, a G.M. spokesman, said: "It'll be virtually impossible to meet the standards with vehicles that resemble the current offerings. We'll have to tear up our product lineup."
James Olson, chief lobbyist for Toyota, a member of the alliance who also says the Senate proposals are unrealistic, said, "Anytime an industry engages Congress, it's always a game of poker." 
"The industry tends to overstate and Congress tends to overact," he said. "Hopefully, you find a middle ground somewhere down the road."

HEADLINE: Technology BriefingTelecommunications:Global Sales Of Cellphones Drop 

BYLINE:  AP (Compiled by Gary Bradford) 

 BODY:
 For the first time, worldwide sales of new cellphones dropped last year. 
The decline came as wireless companies reduced their discounts for new phones and many users held off upgrading to new models. The decline was 3.2 percent, from 412.7 million phones in 2000 to 399.6 million in 2001, the technology consulting company Gartner Dataquest reported yesterday. That is a sharp break from the growth rates of 1996 to 2000, when sales increased 60 percent each year, Gartner said. Most of the decline was in Western Europe, where cellphones are already ubiquitous. Sales were up in North America despite recession in the United States.

HEADLINE: SAVING; 
Socking It Away Amid Red Tape

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
THIS year, under the Bush tax cuts, Americans can save much more for retirement in tax-deferred accounts, like the popular 401(k) plans, than in the past. Luckily, these new increases continue through 2008, with automatic adjustments for inflation after that.
 Carroll A. Campbell Jr., the president of the American Council of Life Insurers, a trade association in Washington, said the new savings limits were "perhaps the most significant retirement security legislation in a generation." 
 Here is the rub: employer retirement plans and state tax laws that do not comply with the new tax cuts may thwart the benefits of these higher savings limits for some workers, especially those 50 and older. 
Under the Bush tax cuts, enacted last summer, an individual is allowed to save $3,000 in an Individual Retirement Account, or I.R.A., compared with the former limit of $2,000, which had been in effect for two decades. Workers who turn 50 by the end of this year can save an additional $500. That means a married couple, 50 and older, can put $7,000 in an I.R.A. By 2008, the maximum will be $5,000; those older than 50 can contribute an additional $1,000. 
The new tax cut also raises the limit that individuals can contribute to tax-deferred retirement savings plans that are offered by employers -- 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans for nonprofit workers and 457 plans for state and local government workers. For the 44 million people whose jobs offer such plans, the limit this year is $11,000; those 50 and older can save an extra $1,000. The limit last year was $10,500, with no extra saving for older workers. 
In 2006, the limits will rise to $15,000; those 50 and older will be able to save $20,000, and double that for a couple.
In 2006, employers can also offer a Roth 401(k), which will allow workers, regardless of income, to save after-tax dollars that will never be taxed again (see the accompanying box). Currently, high-income individuals and couples cannot create Roth I.R.A.'s.
About 44 million workers have 401(k)'s, and 92 percent of them save some amount, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington. Few workers, however, save the maximum, which is not surprising -- half of all tax returns show an annual income of $26,000 or less. In 1999, the latest year for which data is available, only 11 percent of workers in 401(k) plans saved the $10,000 maximum in effect then, according to Jack L. VanDerhei, a senior fellow at the institute.
Ed Slott, an accountant in Rockville Centre, N.Y., who publishes Ed Slott's IRA Advisor, a newsletter, said that "people who can afford to put in the higher amounts are doing it." He added, "But the people who could not afford to put away $2,000 are certainly not putting away $3,000." 
Moreover, there are many obstacles that keep workers from saving the maximum amount, or from saving at all.
For instance, many 401(k) plans require workers to be on the job for a year or more before they can participate. The average 32-year-old worker, however, has already worked for nine employers, according to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao. Workers who change jobs that frequently may never qualify for a 401(k), 403(b) or 457 plan.
Another government rule severely restricts the amount of money workers can save in I.R.A.'s if they have been covered by a 401(k)-type plan or a pension plan for a single day of the year.
Those 50 and older may also have problems saving that extra $1,000 this year in their 401(k), 403(b) or 457 retirement plans. One is that few employers have amended their plans to allow those 50 and older to save an extra amount at the start of the year. Most employers are changing their plans, according to the Profit Sharing/ 401(k) Council of America, using model language from the Internal Revenue Service. But if these changes do not take effect until later this year, many workers may not be able to save the full $1,000.
A second problem arises in 17 states in which the laws do not conform to the Internal Revenue code. Pennsylvania, for one, does not allow any deduction for contributions to retirement savings plans.
In some cases, workers may earn a federal income tax deduction for their extra $1,000 contribution, but not get a state deduction -- and the state may tax the money again when it is withdrawn, said Michael G. Kushner, a vice president of the Segal Company, a benefits consulting firm.
In New Jersey, the additional $1,000 contributions are tax deductible only for 401(k) plans. Workers in 403(b) and 457 plans can still make the extra $1,000 contribution, but will pay state taxes on that money and risk being taxed again by the state when they make withdrawals. 
The other states with laws that do not conform to the federal law are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia and Wisconsin. About half of the 17 states whose retirement savings laws conflict with the federal law are considering conforming, Mr. Kushner said.
Finally, for every lower-middle-income taxpayer who may have trouble making any I.R.A. contribution, the tax law offers a new incentive: a tax credit for couples earning less than $30,000 ($15,000 for singles, $22,500 for single parents). Each dollar they put into an I.R.A. will qualify them for a tax credit of 50 percent of their retirement nest egg, up to a $1,000 credit. Those whose incomes are up to twice these limits will qualify for a credit of 10 percent or 20 percent of what they save, but only if they owe income taxes, which the credit can reduce to zero, making any remaining credit worthless. This credit is good for only four years, 2002 through 2005. 

Be Patient: Rules on Roth I.R.A.'s to Expand
THE Roth I.R.A. has been a favorite of retirement advisers. Although there is no tax deduction when money is contributed, there is also no tax due when the principal and the investment gains are withdrawn. That is, if you follow the rules.
But the Roth has been unavailable to people who earn more than $110,000 if they are single or $160,000 if married. Beginning in 2006, however, employers can also offer a new Roth 401(k) -- even to high-income individuals who do not qualify for a Roth I.R.A. Workers will be allowed to have both traditional and Roth 401(k) plans, and can save a combined maximum of $15,000 annually. People who are 50 and older will be allowed to save a combined maximum of $20,000.
One big advantage of a Roth is that withdrawals are not required, while money in 401(k)-type plans and traditional I.R.A.'s must be withdrawn, and taxed, beginning the year after a taxpayer turns age 70 1/2. Because Roth withdrawals are tax free, there is no effect on an individual's income tax rate. This is important for people who have significant retirement income.
For instance, consider a couple who retire and expect to take $100,000 from their tax-deferred retirement plans each year, paying taxes when they withdraw. Let's say that one year they have to make a major home repair. If the extra money is withdrawn from their 401(k), they will have to take out enough to cover the repairs as well as pay the income taxes, which may push them into a higher tax bracket or force them to lose some deductions. But if the money for the unexpected bill is taken from a Roth, there will be no income tax consequence.
Roths are not allowed in 403(b) plans, which are used by nonprofit groups, or in 457 plans, which are used by state and local governments. Some nonprofit groups have considered converting their 403(b) plans to 401(k)'s to take advantage of the Roth 401(k). Most state and local governments are barred from offering 401(k) plans.
The Roth has another advantage for people who are comfortable leaving money to heirs: in a simple trust, the money can provide a lifetime of income to someone else. A person who contributes $10,000 to a Roth this year, lives 10 more years and then leaves the money to a teenage grandchild is making a gift worth more than $600,000, tax free, over that grandchild's lifetime, assuming an 8 percent annual return.
Most of the money will be distributed near the end of the grandchild's own life, but the number shows how effective Roths can be when you transfer wealth to descendants. DAVID CAY JOHNSTON

HEADLINE: Times Are Tough, but Those Who Save Aren't Panicking, Poll Finds 

BYLINE:  By MARJORIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
ARE Americans more worried about the economy than they were a year ago? Yes. Has that made them more worried about retirement? For the most part, no, according to a national poll conducted recently by The New York Times.
 Most Americans are standing pat on their retirement plans, the poll found. Only about a third of those who have started saving for retirement have made changes in their strategies, most often by saving more or switching their investment funds. 
 The number of people who have postponed retirement also dropped in the last year, to 19 percent from from 24 percent, the poll found. Of the 19 percent, the most common reason cited for working later was the economy's effect on savings.
The telephone survey was conducted Jan. 15 to 17, after the collapse of the Enron Corporation, and of the life savings of employees who had used their 401(k) retirement plans primarily to buy Enron stock. The poll of 1,030 adults, of whom 764 had not yet retired, found that overall, people whose 401(k)s include their employer's stock were not more worried about their financial future than the group at large. But there was some concern about the vulnerability highlighted by the Enron debacle: 42 percent of those who held their own employers' stock said they were at least somewhat worried about holding too much of it.
The survey, whose sampling error for nonretired adults is plus or minus 4 percentage points, found that about a quarter of people with 401(k)'s have at least some of their retirement funds invested that way. (About one in six do not know whether their 401(k) contains any of their own company's stock.)
Overall, most Americans still describe the national economy in positive terms, although not nearly as positively as a year ago. In January 2001, 84 percent of Americans said the national economy was good and only 15 percent considered it bad. This year, 51 percent of Americans regard the economy as good, while the number of people who see it in negative terms has grown to 47 percent. But the number of people who say they are very worried (18 percent) or somewhat worried (42 percent) about their retirement finances is essentially unchanged from a similar poll 11 months ago.
One person who has acted in response to the recession is Kenneth Robson, a 47-year-old computer analyst from St. Louis. "Instead of buying things, we've been saving more, and we're putting it into savings accounts for now," Mr. Robson said in a follow-up interview after the poll was conducted. "It's a major change for us, because we tended to spend a great deal."
Younger adults are much less likely to have made any changes, presumably deciding they had time to wait out any economic downturns. "I'm still young and my future is not something I worry a whole lot about," said Kenny Newcomb, a 27-year-old land surveyor from Staunton, Ill.
On the other hand, people who are older than 45 are more inclined to have made changes in how they manage their retirement savings. Swapping stocks in retirement accounts is a common method -- substituting blue-chip stocks for the riskier dot-com and technology stocks. Barbara Mechanize, a 53-year-old housewife from Cathedral City, Calif., said: "We switched some stocks funds around in our I.R.A.'s. We definitely needed to make changes because at the current rate we were going to be poor, and not just poor, broke."
The most common repositories of Americans' retirement savings are 401(k)'s. In 1995, fewer than half of Americans had such accounts. Since then, 401(k)'s have proliferated and are now owned by almost two-thirds of Americans who have retirement savings.

HEADLINE: SAVING; 
First Came 401(k)'s. Now Some Advice.

BYLINE:  By FRAN HAWTHORNE 

 BODY:
EVEN before Enron became a household word, it was an open secret in the pension world that too many people were making lousy investment decisions with their 401(k) money. If they weren't overdosing on company stock, they were being too cautious, not diversifying enough or diversifying irrationally. 
 What investors need, most experts agree, is better advice. The question is, Where will they find it? 
 They can go to online planners or personal financial advisers, but that requires some initiative (and money). They would be much more likely to take advice if they could get it, like their 401(k) itself, on the job. Most employers, however, have been reluctant to provide anything beyond platitudes, terrified that if they give employees specific advice, and employees lose money by following that advice, they will be sued. 
Two bills in Congress, and a recent decision by the Labor Department, could encourage more employers to offer hands-on advice. But there are serious questions about how effective these moves would be. 
Currently, anyone with a 401(k) has few options regarding low-cost advice. Somewhat personalized guidance is available from Web sites like www.financialengines.com and www.quicken.com. Investors are asked about their income, assets, the age when they hope to retire, expected salary raises and inflation rates and perhaps a list of their 401(k) holdings. With little or no charge, the sites project whether retirement goals can be met. Some sites also recommend how much money to put in stocks and mutual funds.
But not many people relish getting such personal financial advice from an impersonal Web site. "In general, people like to talk to people," says Robert Liberto, a vice president at Segal Advisors, a New York-based investment consulting company.
Talk is not cheap. For a thorough checkup of a client's entire financial picture, middle-class investors will probably need 2 to 10 hours, at $100 to $200 an hour. (Those whose net worth runs into seven figures may pay a more rarefied class of advisers a retainer of $10,000, or a percentage of assets.) 
Naturally, few investors want to fork over this money. Besides, they may not know how to find an adviser, nor have the time to search for one. For these reasons, many financial experts say that employers that sponsor 401(k) plans have a moral obligation to include advice as part of their benefits package. 
"If we're going to throw the responsibility on the individual, we should give them the tools," says Brian Schaefer, the president of 401(k) Ventures in Palo Alto, Calif., which provides companies with investor education for their employees.
It is unclear how many employers are offering their workers advice. A survey of 909 401(k) plans in December 2000 by the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America found that only 35 percent gave employees investment advice. More than half of them picked up the tab. 
This figure is probably overgenerous. Forty-seven percent offered services only on the Internet, and of those providing individual advice, most were small companies, with 50 or fewer participants. Nor did the survey specify whether the advice was available to everyone on a regular basis, only to top brass as a perk or as a one-shot offer after a round of layoffs. 
IN the mid-90's, the Labor Department expanded its guidelines to encourage employers to give more advice, as long as it comes from an independent adviser and not directly from the employer or the investment company that manages the assets. These rulings were meant to alert employers that there was no "untoward fiduciary liability" if the employer chose the adviser prudently and monitored the service, says Olena Berg Lacy, the assistant Labor secretary in charge of pensions during the Clinton administration. If anything, she adds, "you probably decrease your liability by giving your employees the help they need." Ms. Lacy is now a director of financialengines.com.
In December, those rules were further loosened. The Labor Department said that in limited circumstances, an independent firm could actually take over the decision-making from the employee instead of merely suggesting investment strategies that the employee is free to ignore. But the investment decisions must be strongly based on computer models.
These Labor Department rulings have not persuaded employers they are off the hook. So Congress is stepping in. Senators Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, and Susan Collins, Republican from Maine, introduced a bill last year that unambiguously states that employers are not liable for losses stemming from investment advice rendered by "qualified" third parties. This bill may be included in Enron-related legislation sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts.
Representative John A. Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, has sponsored a more controversial bill, supported by the Bush administration, that would allow employers to hire mutual fund companies, insurers and other investment firms that already manage the employers' 401(k) assets to provide advice. This bill, passed by the House in November, is now part of the White House's broader post-Enron pensions package.
Mr. Boehner said that such a change would help investors. "If you don't allow those that have the most experience to offer investment advice," he says, "we'd diminish the amount of advice that would be available to employees." Because big investment companies can bundle their advice with other services, these firms would presumably charge less than independent financial planners. Moreover, these firms, Mr. Boehner says, would be required to disclose conflicts of interest. 
This plan has many critics, who warn that there would be too much temptation for a Vanguard or a Fidelity to advise 401(k) investors that the best allocation for their money is -- surprise! -- a high-fee Vanguard or Fidelity fund. Employers need to hire independent firms "to come in just for advice, absolutely no other hidden agenda, not affiliated with a sales organization," says Sheryl Garrett, the president of Garrett Planning Network, a Kansas-based network of small financial planners.
In the post-Enron world, some skeptics wonder if any investment advice from an employer can be trusted. During recent Senate hearings, a few senators questioned whether advisers paid by employers would recommend not buying company stock. But restricting employer-sponsored advisers would leave employees to find -- and pay for -- advice on their own. That may be the worst predicament. "What happened at Enron really underscores the need to give participants all the help that they need in making the right decision," Ms. Lacy of financialengines.com, says.

HEADLINE: WELL-BEING; 
The Golden Years For Silver Prices

BYLINE:  By FRED BROCK 

 BODY:
THE recession, Enron debacle and erratic stock prices have convinced many people that they may have to delay their retirement and work a few more years to nurture their nest eggs.
 You can't really blame them. After all, a lot of air has gone out of stock-based 401(k) plans since the Clinton boom years of the late 1990's. In addition, savers have been told by most financial advisers for years that they need 70 percent -- better yet, 80 percent -- of their preretirement income to retire comfortably. These figures usually come from mutual fund companies or stockbrokers. Charles R. Schwab, the chairman of the brokerage firm that bears his name, has even suggested that in some cases people may need 100 percent to retire. 
 But before you resign yourself to working longer or a cat-food diet, take a deep breath and consider Fred E. Waddell, a Web site called BestPlaces.net and Elton Pasea. 
Mr. Waddell, a 66-year-old money-management specialist in Smith Mountain Lake, Va., trains financial counselors. He contends that estimates of how much you need to retire are unrealistically inflated by the mutual fund and equities industries and accuses them of "fear selling" to attract customers and their money.
"The mutual fund industry persists in using these inflated figures because they have a vested interest in doing so," said Mr. Waddell, who is also a retired associate professor at Auburn University in Alabama. "This frightens people into thinking they're going to need a great deal more in savings than they really will. As a result, people oversave for retirement or put off retiring. These unrealistic projections can also be psychologically depressing for a lot of people who think they'll never have enough."
The projections are flawed, according to Mr. Waddell, because they are based on preretirement income rather than on preretirement expenditures. 
"Most older people, with their children gone and expenses down, are saving as much as they can in anticipation of retirement," he said. "They may be living on 40 percent or less of their disposable income and saving the rest. In my case, I was living on 35 to 40 percent of my take-home pay, and I think I was typical. Well, when you retire you don't have to save for retirement anymore. So right now I'm living on 100 percent of my preretirement income, which was only 35 to 40 percent of my total disposable income.
"When people say you need X percent of preretirement income, it defies explanation," he continued. "It's a huge mistake to base these projections on income rather than expenses. The only sensible way is to compare your expenses, preretirement and postretirement. For financial planners to ignore these common-sense considerations raises questions about their objectivity."
That you can probably retire on much less than you have been led to believe is especially the case if your house is mostly paid for and you are willing to move to a less expensive area -- which does not necessarily have to be remote or far away. Your home equity may allow you to pay cash for a new home, which means no house payments.
Mr. Waddell points out, however, that if you are not 65 and not eligible for Medicare -- and your company's retirement plan has no health insurance benefit -- your medical expenses will probably increase, especially if you must buy your own health insurance. 
If you work in an expensive metropolitan area like New York or San Francisco, calculate how much money you spend to maintain yourself in that environment, and how much you spend on work-related items like parking, commuting, clothes and lunches. Stop working, move to a cheaper area and watch the expenses disappear.
Not to mention taxes. Nine states have no income taxes: Alaska, Florida, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming. Five have no general sales tax: Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon. Be careful, though, of property taxes, which can be high in states with low income or sales taxes. You might want to settle for a state with a modest sales or income tax if property taxes are low.
BestPlaces.net can give you a good idea just how self-serving the mutual fund projections can be. This Web site, which carries no advertising and requires no subscription fees, allows you to compare cost-of-living and quality-of-life data for 3,000 towns and cities across the United States. You can also compare salary data for 300 metropolitan areas. For instance, if you make $100,000 a year in New York City, you will need only $41,134 a year to maintain the same living standard in Jacksonville, Fla. -- and that assumes a mortgage payment and work-related expenses.
A house that costs $204,600 in New York City will cost $96,900 in Jacksonville. The sales tax in Jacksonville is 6 percent, compared with 8.25 percent in New York City; Florida has no state income tax. The annual auto insurance premium for a midsize sedan is $770 versus $1,640. So if you are retired and have paid for your home, do you really need 80 percent of your preretirement income, or $80,000, to live in Jacksonville? Suddenly, 40 to 60 percent, a range with which Mr. Waddell agrees, looks more than ample.
Bert Sperling is the chief executive of Fast Forward, the Portland, Ore., company that operates BestPlaces.net. The site makes money by selling data to corporations and publications like Money magazine, which publish articles about places to live or retire. Mr. Sperling said that his site used mostly government sources for data with a lag time of about nine months.
BestPlaces.net is especially helpful if you are planning to retire elsewhere. But if you want to more or less stay put, Mr. Sperling suggests moving to a less expensive place that is within a reasonable driving distance of where you have been living.
For residents in the New York area, an example might be eastern Pennsylvania. Allentown, for instance, is less than two hours away from the city. To maintain the same standard of living in Allentown, a $100,000 salary could drop to $42,626, which also assumes a mortgage payment and work expenses. The median value of a house there is $120,100. Sales tax is 6 percent; the state income tax rate on $50,000 of income is about one-third of New York's. Annual auto insurance is $590.
What if you want to continue living in the same house and neighborhood? Presumably you will be mostly rid of a mortgage and work-related expenses. But many other expenses may remain the same.
One option is a reverse mortgage, in which you borrow against your house's value to get a lump sum or monthly payments to supplement your income. You are not required to make any repayments as long as you stay put. If you move or die, you or your heirs can pay back the loan by selling the house. Meanwhile, no one can kick you out. Here's a really good part: if you live long enough for the accumulating interest to push the total debt above your house's value, the difference is paid by insurance built into the loan. That means the mortgage company cannot touch anything else in your estate. A good source of information on reverse mortgages is the National Center for Home Equity Conversion's Web site (www.reverse.org) Cooperative apartments and mobile homes do not qualify.
Many people are aware how overblown some retirement-needs projections are because they have relatives or friends who live in less-expensive regions and are faring reasonably well on modest incomes.
Take Elton Pasea.
In October 1998, Mr. Pasea, a native of Trinidad who lives in Nederland, Tex., was the subject of a column in The New York Times. He was 76 and living nicely on $1,200 a month: $700 from Social Security and $500 from a union pension. He described himself as the "happiest guy in Texas."
Very little has changed in Mr. Pasea's circumstances. His Social Security has increased to $800, raising his total income to $1,300 a month, or $15,600 a year. "I'm loaded now," he said.
Mr. Pasea, who will be 80 in May, owns his home and has about $33,000 -- his life's savings -- invested in certificates of deposit. He has never owned stocks, bonds or mutual funds.
He is an avid bicyclist and rides about 4,000 miles a year. He travels to Europe every year or so; he and a friend are taking a bicycle trip to Italy in May. They will save on expenses by staying in youth hostels.
A widower, Mr. Pasea retired to the Texas Gulf Coast in 1984 after 41 years of roaming the world as a merchant seaman. Texas has no income tax and his property taxes are only about $400 a year; utility bills run about $100 a month. His 1984 Nissan has 232,000 miles on it.
In 1998, he was often living on less than $500 a month and using the rest for travel or for savings. Now, he says, at 79, he is less concerned about savings. "But it's difficult for me to spend $1,300 a month," he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Auditors Find Things Are Differentin Russia 

BYLINE:  By SABRINA TAVERNISE 

DATELINE: MOSCOW, March 11 

 BODY:
The big American accounting firms were among the first foreign companies to arrive in Russia after the fall of Communism. They opened offices here and in other former Soviet republics, and rapidly landed many of the largest companies as clients.
 But in their competitive rush for a foothold, the Big Six (now Big Five) auditors lent their reputations to practices that in the West would be regarded as unethical if not illegal, current and former employees of the firms said in recent interviews. 
 The employees of the auditing firms -- Arthur Andersen; Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu; Ernst & Young; KPMG International; and PricewaterhouseCoopers -- are bound by agreements guaranteeing confidentiality to their clients, and they spoke on condition that they, and in some cases the firms they were associated with, not be identified.
As auditing firms have come under increased scrutiny since the collapse of the Enron Corporation, most attention in Russia has focused not on Andersen, Enron's auditor, but on PricewaterhouseCoopers, which has been accused by minority shareholders and regulators of failing to look critically at a pattern of vanishing assets at Gazprom, the giant gas monopoly. 
In the chaotic early years of new Russian capitalism, accounting standards here were poorly suited to market economics. They were built around reporting to tax authorities, not gauging a company's financial health for investors. Oversight was all but nonexistent and the legal system was undeveloped, leaving room for manipulation and theft.
In many cases, Russian managers actively tried to conceal the true financial condition of their companies, as Enron managers have been accused of doing. But instead of disguising losses, the Russian managers wanted to disguise profits, both from tax inspectors and from shareholders. 
In this environment, Western auditing firms could have and should have held their Russian clients to higher standards of behavior, investors in Russian companies are now saying. But instead, according to the current and former auditing employees, as well as analysts and government officials interviewed, the auditors often chose to play by Russian rules, and in doing so sacrificed the transparency that investors were counting on them to ensure.
In Russia, auditors "check that the paperwork was done correctly, but look right past the deeply corrupt heart of the matter," said Pyotr Karpov, the former head of the government's financial accounts commission, which investigated companies with large tax arrears. "They interpret their mission very narrowly," Mr. Karpov said. "In a society with morals and functioning societal controls, that approach can work. But not in Russia."
Consider AvtoVAZ, Russia's biggest car company. Auditors and tax consultants from Price Waterhouse, now part of PricewaterhouseCoopers, began examining the company's books in 1993. 
The audits did not give AvtoVAZ a completely clean bill of health. For example, in its 1997 Russian audit, Price Waterhouse warned that AvtoVAZ was accounting for domestic and foreign sales differently, and that it could not say how much the inconsistency affected reported sales revenue.
But this red flag hardly conveyed what was actually going on at the company. "They shipped the cars to all these wonderful dealers, and the dealers disappeared after six months with huge debts that were written off," said a former Price Waterhouse employee who worked on the audit. " 'What's going on?' " the former employee recalled thinking. " 'You aren't getting paid -- no guarantees, no nothing. Are you stupid?' It was clear to me that it was part of an organized robbery."
Mr. Karpov, who went through the auto company's books in late 1995, said he saw a similar problem, with nearly $1 billion in uncollected bills for shipped cars.
By 2000, the warnings by PricewaterhouseCoopers about AvtoVAZ had become much sharper, expressing doubts that the company could pay its debts over the next year. 
AvtoVAZ did not respond to requests for comment.
In a written statement, PricewaterhouseCoopers said that it stood by its audits of AvtoVAZ, that there were no material errors in its 1997 financial statements and that the accounting firm could not respond to general and unsubstantiated claims by the former employee.
Even so, principals of the Moscow office of PricewaterhouseCoopers are clearly concerned about mounting criticism of the firm as misdeeds at clients like Gazprom come to light. The principals took out full-page advertisements in two of Russia's business dailies in late February to argue that an audit "does not represent a review of each transaction, or a qualitative assessment of a company's performance." 
Hold on, say investors -- if not the auditor, who will give the public an accurate picture of a company's finances?
William Browder, manager of the $600 million Hermitage Fund in Moscow, said: "If the auditors were doing their job properly, they would say, 'Why did you do business with that particular oil trading firm?' or 'Why did you sell assets to that person? Is that a relative? If so, we'll have to disclose it in the audit.' Then we'd have a clearer picture."
Sales at far-below-market prices to companies owned by managers or their families are another common abuse here. A team from a Big Five auditor found evidence that something like that may have been going on at a factory in the Urals.
A member of the team said in an interview that a colleague was able to get sales data from a low-level employee in the factory's computer center that showed much of its output being sold extremely cheaply to obscure offshore companies. The accountant who got the data informed the auditing firm's Moscow partners, his colleague said, but the partners refused to mention the suspicious sales in the audit. The accountant who got the data later resigned.
Fierce competition for clients may account for some laxness by auditors. The biggest, most lucrative clients were also the most complex, and at times auditing employees said they felt pressure to sign off on questionable practices by such clients to avoid alienating them.
"A big client is god," said one former employee of Ernst & Young in Moscow. "You do what they want and tell you to do. You can play straightlaced and try to be upright and protect your reputation with minor clients, but you can't do it with the big guys. If you lose that account, no matter how justified you are, that's the end of a career."
Gazprom is held up by critics of the auditors as a case in point. Of the 800 employees PricewaterhouseCoopers has in Moscow, 50 work on Gazprom alone, according to a former employee assigned to the account.
A spokesman for the auditing firm declined to say how much of its business Gazprom represents. In a statement last month, the firm dismissed as "absurd" the accusation that it compromises its standards to retain big clients. 
Some investors are unpersuaded. "The only related-party transactions PricewaterhouseCoopers eventually disclosed were those that found their way into the public domain," said Charles E. Ryan, the chairman of the United Financial Group, an investment bank that has Gazprom shareholders as customers. "If you believe their assessment, you would conclude we found 100 percent of the related-party deals. I doubt that is true."
Russian business -- and auditing -- has changed markedly since the mid-1990's. Managers of some Russian companies now try hard to please minority shareholders. AvtoVAZ, which began a joint venture with General Motors last year, now posts two years of financial data on its Web site. And changes in several laws since 1998 have modernized some Russian accounting practices and, more recently, made auditors more responsible for the integrity of the figures they sign.
"There has been quite an evolution of financial statements over the years," said Stanley Root, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Moscow. "The accountancy profession started from scratch. Companies have come a long way since then. We are here to help our clients improve their level of disclosure."
The firm emerges in a positive light from a 1998 audit of Purneftegaz, an oil company partly owned by the state-owned Rosneft and partly by minority shareholders.
According to Dmitry Vasiliev, former head of the Russian Federal Securities Commission, the company's managers have been selling oil to Rosneft at deep discounts, to the detriment of its other shareholders. PricewaterhouseCoopers mentioned the practice in its audit report.
The following year, Purneftegaz dropped the firm and hired Arthur Andersen as its auditor. Analysts say the discounted sales continued, but they are not mentioned in Andersen's audits. Hans Horn, Andersen's managing partner in Moscow, said Russian law does not require such disclosure.

HEADLINE: World Bank, in Report, Defends Its Use of Aid 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11 

 BODY:
The World Bank said today that its aid programs had helped ease poverty and allowed poor people to "live longer, healthier and more productive lives," defending its track record against Bush administration charges that it has been ineffective.
 The report highlighting the bank's successes was released as the lending agency and several of its main donor nations, including the United States, are locked in a struggle over the quantity and usefulness of foreign aid. 
 President Bush, who is scheduled to meet other world leaders in Monterrey, Mexico, next week to discuss ways to help the poor, wants to overhaul the World Bank and convert many of its loans into grants. European leaders have resisted, saying the real problem is that the United States devotes too little money to fighting poverty. 
The United States has already blocked an effort by Britain, the World Bank and the United Nations to use the Monterrey conference to push for large-scale increases in foreign aid. But Bush administration officials and their European counterparts are still arguing about how much money to give the World Bank for the next three years and what conditions to place on the aid.
While the bank did not name its critics, its report, "The Role and Effectiveness of Development Assistance," was clearly meant to answer complaints made by Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill. Mr. O'Neill has argued that the bank's loans have heaped debt on developing countries but have done little to relieve poverty.
The bank said in its report that its aid programs have become more effective since the end of the cold war, because aid is now used less often to reward allies and more often to support viable projects. In 1990, the bank said, $1 billion of aid lifted some 105,000 people out of extreme poverty. The same amount in 1998 helped 284,000 people climb out of poverty -- a tripling of its productivity, it says.
The report cited success stories in Bangladesh, Botswana, Chile, China, India, Poland, South Korea, Uganda and Vietnam, and it claimed specific achievements like helping reduce river blindness in West Africa and iodine deficiencies in China. The antipoverty loans the bank has made not only produce a healthy return in income improvements, the bank said, but they also are a catalyst to attract private investment to poor areas.
More broadly, the bank said, foreign aid has added 20 years to life expectancy in poor countries in the last four decades, and has cut their illiteracy rate in half. 
The bank acknowledges some serious mistakes -- failing to do more to limit the devastating effects of AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, or to increase incomes there after 1965. And more people live in poverty in Eastern Europe and Central Asia now than a decade ago, the bank said.
"People in developing countries are much healthier and better educated today than they were 50 years ago," said Nicholas Stern, the bank's chief economist. "It shows that the development community has learned from experience -- from success and failure."
James D. Wolfensohn, the bank's president, cited some of the report's conclusions last week, when he called on rich countries to double their aid spending, to $40 billion to $60 billion a year. 
The report's conclusions seem unlikely to sway some of its critics.
Speaking at a Treasury briefing, Mr. O'Neill said today that he would be "delighted to have demonstrated facts to show that we have been greatly successful" in fighting poverty, but he expressed doubts that he could be easily persuaded.
"We have so many people in the world living on less than $1 per day, and that does not sound like 50 years of success," he said.
Mr. O'Neill has argued that the bank could be more effective if it gave money to health, education and sanitation projects in the developing world, instead of lending money to governments that sometimes waste the resources.
Bill Easterly, a former bank economist who now works at the Center for Global Development in Washington, raised questions about the examples in the report, arguing that it selectively reviewed positive statistics and countries but ignored some broad failures. 
Mr. Easterly questioned the inclusion of countries like India and China in the list of those the bank claims grew out of extreme poverty under its guidance. Bank aid accounted for a small proportion of the economic activity in those countries but much more in nations that have failed to emerge from poverty, he said.
"It's an old game that you pick whatever country or project is doing well, and then say it is doing well because our aid and advice and intervention," Mr. Easterly said.
Another longtime bank watcher, Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard University, said the bank was right to defend the effectiveness of many aid programs and to press for increased contributions from wealthy countries. 
Some of the bank's programs have failed, Mr. Sachs said, but those failures often resulted from misguided efforts to reward Western allies during the cold war, programs that the bank was pressed to support by the United States. He also argued that the bank had been forced to make do with too few resources.
"For most of the problems, responsibility lies with major donor countries, not with the professionalism of the bank," he said. 

CORRECTION-DATE: March 13, 2002

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in World Business yesterday about a report defending the effectiveness of World Bank aid to poor countries misstated a figure used by by James D. Wolfensohn, the bank president, for foreign aid increases. Mr. Wolfensohn called on wealthy nations to spend $40 billion to $60 billion more each year -- an amount that would double total aid spending. He did not say nations should increase their aid spending to $40 billion to $60 billion a year.

HEADLINE: Missing James Tobin 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
James Tobin -- Yale professor, Nobel laureate and adviser to John F. Kennedy -- died yesterday. He was a great economist and a remarkably good man; his passing seems to me to symbolize the passing of an era, one in which economic debate was both nicer and a lot more honest than it is today.
 Mr. Tobin was one of those economic theorists whose influence reaches so far that many people who have never heard of him are nonetheless his disciples. He was also, however, a public figure, for a time the most prominent advocate of an ideology we might call free-market Keynesianism -- a belief that markets are fine things, but that they work best if the government stands ready to limit their excesses. In a way, Mr. Tobin was the original New Democrat; it's ironic that some of his essentially moderate ideas have lately been hijacked by extremists right and left. 
 Mr. Tobin was one of the economists who brought the Keynesian revolution to America. Before that revolution, there seemed to be no middle ground in economics between laissez-faire fatalism and heavy-handed government intervention -- and with laissez-faire policies widely blamed for the Great Depression, it was hard to see how free-market economics could survive. John Maynard Keynes changed all that: with judicious use of monetary and fiscal policy, he suggested, a free-market system could avoid future depressions. 
What did James Tobin add? Basically, he took the crude, mechanistic Keynesianism prevalent in the 1940's and transformed it into a far more sophisticated doctrine, one that focused on the tradeoffs investors make as they balance risk, return and liquidity.
In the 1960's Mr. Tobin's sophisticated Keynesianism made him the best-known intellectual opponent of Milton Friedman, then the advocate of a rival (and rather naive) doctrine known as monetarism. For what it's worth, Mr. Friedman's insistence that changes in the money supply explain all of the economy's ups and downs has not stood the test of time; Mr. Tobin's focus on asset prices as the driving force behind economic fluctuations has never looked better. (Mr. Friedman is himself a great economist -- but his reputation now rests on other work.)
But Mr. Tobin is probably best known today for two policy ideas, both of which have been hijacked -- his own word -- by people whose political views he did not share.
First, Mr. Tobin was the intellectual force behind the Kennedy tax cut, which started the boom of the 1960's. The irony is that nowadays that tax cut is usually praised by hard-line conservatives, who regard such cuts as an elixir for whatever ails you. Mr. Tobin did not agree. In fact I was on a panel with him just last week, where he argued strongly that the current situation called for more domestic spending, not more tax cuts.
Second, back in 1972 Mr. Tobin proposed that governments levy a small tax on foreign exchange transactions, as a way to discourage destabilizing speculation. He thought of this tax as a way to help promote free trade, by assuring countries that they could open their markets without exposing themselves to disruptive movements of "hot money." Again, irony: the "Tobin tax" has become a favorite of hard-line opponents of free trade, especially the French group Attac. As Mr. Tobin declared, "the loudest applause is coming from the wrong side."
Why do I feel that Mr. Tobin's passing marks the end of an era? Consider that Kennedy Council of Economic Advisers, the most remarkable collection of economic talent to serve the U.S. government since Alexander Hamilton pondered alone. Mr. Tobin, incredibly, was only one of three future Nobelists then working at the council. Would such a group be possible today?
I doubt it. When Mr. Tobin went to Washington, top economists weren't subject to strict political litmus tests -- and it would never have occurred to them that the job description included saying things that were manifestly untrue. Need I say more?
Yesterday I spoke with William Brainard, another Yale professor who worked with Mr. Tobin, who remarked on his colleague's "faith in the power of ideas." That's a faith that grows ever harder to maintain, as bad ideas with powerful political backing dominate our discourse. 
So I miss James Tobin, and I mourn not just his passing, but the passing of an era when economists of such fundamental decency could flourish, and even influence policy.

HEADLINE: Is Recycling's Future Behind It?; 
Bloomberg Puts Doing Well Ahead of Doing Good

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
A lot of the 1970's seems pretty remote these days. The Led Zeppelin records gather dust. High-mileage economy cars and low thermostats to conserve energy have given way to cheap gasoline and sport utility vehicles. Afros and "Have a Nice Day" buttons are the stuff of camp and kitsch.
 But recycling lives on. 
 From its early roots after the first Earth Day in 1970, when parking lot recycling centers began popping up, reuse became the middle-American expression of environmental awareness. Recycling, its supporters believed, was a tiny lever that could work its way into the average American household -- and consciousness -- and through repetition and habit forge the realization that throwaway culture has its costs, that packaging matters, and that using less is probably a good thing.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg now says recycling is rather more earthbound than that: it's about making the budget numbers work. Some recycling makes sense, specifically paper, which generates revenue for New York City, he said. But glass, metal and plastic recycling costs money, and under the mayor's budget plan is to be dropped, perhaps to be brought back when New York can better afford it. 
Few people dispute Mr. Bloomberg's assertion that tough times demand tough choices. But to a great degree, experts in consumer behavior say, the mayor's proposal -- and the anguished reaction that some people have had to it -- also says a lot about the long strange trip that recycling has been through over the years.
Psychologists do not have a firm answer why saving and sorting took such root in the American psyche. Some think that it tapped into a frugal frontier impulse that is also behind the phenomenon of swap meets and garage sales, that one person's junk must surely be good for something. Others say it became a crutch, a way for Americans to feel as if they were contributing to the environment without actually changing their consumption-driven behavior. In any case, it is often said that more Americans recycle than vote. 
But gradually, through the 80's and 90's, the basis of considering recycling's value also began to change. Giant corporations like Waste Management took over much of the business, introducing tools of market analysis that would have seemed alien a decade earlier. Cities like New York continued to spend millions of dollars to advertise recycling's civic virtues, but increasingly, if quietly, the question was no longer did recycling do good, but did it do well. 
"What's happened over time and what we're dealing with now is that the initial spirit of recycling has been eliminated," said Michael Lounsbury, an assistant professor of sociology at Cornell University who studies industrial and labor organizations. "Decisions are made on very narrow cost-benefit calculations."
People like Dr. Lounsbury say that the two distinct personalities of recycling -- the mother earth aura that was embraced by Americans and the number-crunching alter ego that emerged later -- are what really collided in New York in Mr. Bloomberg's budget address last month. 
The question now is what happens next. Is recycling still a feel-good enterprise, or has Mr. Bloomberg lifted the curtain to reveal that behind all the imagery of higher purpose there was no Great Oz at all, but only a mousy accountant with an adding machine?
"I think people are sort of in shock," said the Bronx borough president, Adolfo Carrion Jr. "Here we've been doing this public education campaign, talking about conserving water, reducing waste. We told people this is for the greater good, we passed laws requiring citizens to participate in protecting the environment, then suddenly we say we're going to give up because it doesn't quite balance the ledger."
Recycling has always been linked to the market economy: reuse means returning material to the manufacturing sector. Many pioneer recyclers remember the mountains of bottles and paper that piled up in the first recycling centers, before reuse markets had developed.
But the rough patch that recycling has hit in recent years is not just a matter of markets. New York City's sanitation commissioner, John J. Doherty, said in an interview that he saw a kind of wall in recycling, with each new percentage increase in the so-called diversion rate -- how much is taken out of the garbage stream -- becoming harder and more expensive to achieve.
Patterns of behavior have changed too. More and more beverages are drunk outside the home, in people's cars and in public places. Many containers -- the water, sports drink and juice bottles that seem to be everywhere and that didn't exist a generation ago -- are thrown out rather than be saved and put in a recycling bin. 
Nationally, the container recycling rate peaked in the early to mid-1990's and has been drifting lower ever since. 
But recycling's rhythms have been especially tied to the question of landfills, and waste industry experts say that a looming constriction of space -- predicted in the 1970's but avoided in the 1980's with the vast expansion of landfills in states like Pennsylvania -- may now ultimately prove to be recycling's best hope of a resurgence. 
The ample availability of landfills, especially in the Northeast, kept garbage disposal prices cheap through the 1990's, even as labor prices involved in recycling went up. It really was becoming cheaper to throw things away, and so it appeared by the logic of the market perspective that recycling had failed. 
But that availability is now over, and some researchers say that the Bloomberg administration may well have bet on the wrong horse. In the next decade, they say, the graph lines could cross once again and recycling, rejected now on the basis of market calculation, could well be rescued by the same logic as it becomes the cheaper alternative. 
"There will be an increasing incentive to recycle," said James Thompson Jr., the president of Chartwell Information Publishers, a San Diego company that tracks the waste industry. "It will force communities and people to rethink the whole waste problem. The corner is turning right now, especially in the Northeast."
The turning of that corner is when the biggest psychological unknown of Mr. Bloomberg's recycling experiment could have its test. Could recycling be brought back? Would ingrained habits be lost? Perhaps most important, would people feel different about it?
"Before, you were helping the planet, etc.," said Raymond De Young, an associate professor of environmental psychology and conservation behavior at the University of Michigan. "But that argument may not carry as much weight as it did in the past, because of the way it was shut down. I can imagine people thinking that the city is being hypocritical, or that recycling is meaningless."
On the other hand, he said, the mayor might also have opened a door to a new kind of learning curve about recycling, that talking about the intricacies of the pulp and plastics markets could make it even more relevant to residents.
It might also raise the broader question of whether recycling really worked, not by the narrow measures of the market alone, but by the standards of what it set out to do: change the way Americans think. Environmentalists say that the psychological returns are mixed. Consumer packaging, after 30 years of supposed consciousness raising, is more profligate than ever. Twelve-mile-per-gallon Range Rovers prowl the streets. 
"I'm not sure what the measure is of something working in our society," said Theodore Roszak, a professor of history at California State University at Hayward, whose book "The Voice of the Earth" (Simon & Schuster, 1992)., is considered one of the founding works of the field of eco-psychology, which examines the ways that people relate to the earth and its environment. 
Dr. Roszak said that recycling may in the end be a small thing because it hasn't changed much or a big thing because of what it may yet achieve. No one can tell yet, he said.
"Certainly recycling is not enough, but there is nothing we would gain by giving up the recycling effort either," he said. "The one thing you can say is that it's something we have gotten in the habit of doing and it seems like a step forward from where we were."

HEADLINE: Via South America, A Beachfront Boom For South Florida 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: SUNNY ISLES BEACH, Fla., March 5 

 BODY:
When Juan Mendez-Bages looked down the South Florida coastline five years ago, he saw more than the blond sand beaches and rows of palm trees. An international real estate broker from Colombia, he saw a refuge for himself and his money.
 "Unfortunately, the economies in Latin America are weak and at times unstable," Mr. Mendez-Bages said. "Investing in the United States gives you a more real stability." 
 Since his initial assessment, Mr. Mendez-Bages has been snapping up property throughout South Florida. He owns two one-bedroom units at the Ritz-Carlton in Key Biscayne and several other properties in the area, including two oceanfront condominiums in this tiny city on the edge of North Miami Beach for which he paid a total of $1 million. 
"I've been a Realtor for 10 years," Mr. Mendez-Bages said, "and I noticed most of my clients were making a lot of money in these investments, and I decided to do the same for myself. It's just a safe way to go, a secure investment."
Spurred by investors like Mr. Mendez-Bages, South Florida skirted the national economic downturn largely because of an infusion of cash, primarily from Latin American buyers fleeing the crippled economy of Argentina and the political instability of Venezuela and Colombia. 
According to data from the National Association of Home Builders, Florida led the country last year in permits for new homes, with 165,000, most of them in South Florida. While permits granted for new privately owned buildings rose 5 percent nationwide from January 2001 to January 2002, they rose 28 percent in Florida, according to Haver Analytics, which collects economic data.
One notable sign of the boom, perhaps, is that some big players, like Donald J. Trump, are lending their names to half-billion-dollar projects.
The growth is also fed by aging baby boomers and retirees who are trading in houses in the suburbs all over the country for new condominiums on the beach in South Florida.
"I had a guy who bought a unit here, get this, who worked at U.P.S. his entire life," said Gil Dezer, president of Dezer Development, the city's largest landowner. "If you saw the guy on the street, you wouldn't think he had a dime to his name. But he was a shareholder when U.P.S. went public and he is a millionaire. He bought a $400,000 unit with $80,000 down."
Several years ago, envisioning just that sort of demand, Mr. Dezer's father, the New York developer Michael Dezer, started buying up all the property he could, including blocks of bargain-rate motels dotting the oceanfront, offering rooms for $39.95 per night with free cable television. 
"Every owner, I was after him to sell to me," said Michael Dezer, who with his son has since bought 27 acres of prime oceanfront real estate here and replaced the old motels with 11 hotels and resorts.
The latest father-son project is a collaboration with Mr. Trump, the Trump Grande Ocean Resort and Residence. It is a $600 million condominium and hotel development where units start at $350,000 for a studio and go up to $5 million for a penthouse with pool.
Not everyone is as enthusiastic as the Dezers. Some experts on the local economy point out that devastating busts often follow South Florida's booms. Others worry that the market may soon become saturated with hotels, condominiums, offices. 
"I think we have probably already overbuilt on the condo side," said Raymond Fishe, a University of Miami economist. "Prices will adjust downward, particularly on the high-end luxury units, to clear them out."
Still, it is clear that the Florida building boom continued even as construction in other states faltered. Florida's resurgence dates to the mid-1990's with Internet millionaires spending their cash on cars and condos. When the technology bubble burst, development in South Florida continued as an influx of not just Latin Americans but also retirees from other parts of the country offset the decline. Now, the local market continues to thrive as a growing number of American empty-nesters are buying property in places like Miami Beach and Plantation, in nearby Broward County. Some are selling modest houses elsewhere to move to maintenance-free condominiums and retirement communities here while others are trading in higher-end houses to splurge on resort-style developments.
South Florida has also had more residents arriving from Central America and the Caribbean. The influx is creating demand not just for private development but also for huge public works, like the widening of Interstate 95 and an expansion of Miami International Airport. 
"There is such a different dynamic and diversification of what drives the economy here," said Frank Nero, president and chief executive of the Beacon Council, the local economic development agency. "That's why the construction industry keeps humming along."
Mr. Nero added: "Our economy is being driven by various regions that aren't experiencing downturns at the same time. I won't say we're completely insulated from what is happening, but we are able to buffer it somewhat."
In the private sector, projects under way or recently completed include the $255 million performing arts center going up in downtown Miami and the $800 million Westin Diplomat Resort and Spa in Hollywood, which opened last month. The demand is such that just about anyone who can pound a nail can find work in the construction industry.
"There is demand for labor and it is getting thin," said William J. Delgado, executive vice president of the Latin Builders Association in Miami. "That's good news."
South Florida and the rest of the state have not altogether escaped the effects of the recession and slowdown after Sept. 11.
"There are some particularly hard-hit sectors," said Dave Denslow, an economist at the University of Florida, "with tourism and air travel being notable ones." 
An overbuilt condominium market is not the only risk. Developers may soon find that the region cannot sustain so many new hotels, Mr. Fishe, the economist, said. "Those folks anticipated an upswing in the high-end clientele, and that happened, but there is only so much to go around, and when that occurs, prices adjust to fix it," he said.
Even so, Florida has had the fastest-growing economy in the United States in the last year, and developers here seem to have little concern that the pace may slow. Overwhelmingly, they point first to the business in Latin America in justifying the condominiums and hotels that they are putting up on nearly any available patch of land, financed mostly by American banks.
"Eighty percent of all business with Latin America comes through Miami at some point," said Ford Gibson, president of the Codina Group, a local development company that is nearing completion on an office complex in Weston, west of Fort Lauderdale, and has just completed a $35 million, 200,000-square-foot office building in Boca Raton for the I.B.M. Corporation. "That attracts growth."
What is more, developers see no end to the "flight capital" coming from Latin America, said Richard Neve, senior vice president of the Hogan Group, a development firm in Miami that is building the Waterford at Blue Lagoon, a $400 million office building near the Miami airport. "When things look bad, bring your money north," Mr. Neve said the thinking goes. 
Though Argentina and other struggling Latin countries restricted money leaving the country, these limits have not significantly affected the South Florida real estate market, economists and developers say. The main reason, they say, is that many foreign investors anticipated the instability in their countries and moved their money early.
Those who did not divert money then have found ways around the new regulations, area developers say. Some, for instance, have been converting their currencies to dollars by using stock brokers in one country to buy shares in publicly traded American companies and then transferring the accounts to American brokerage firms and selling the stock for dollars, says an international developer whose clients have used the technique.
"The stock game is to pull out $100,000 or $200,000 and turn it into cash," said the developer, who refused to be named for fear of risking his relations with foreign buyers.
Regardless of how they come up with the cash, the combination of Latin investors, retirees and the occasional U.P.S. millionaire moving into South Florida with money to spend has transformed the region, said Michael Dezer, who is developing Sunny Isles Beach. "It is an unstoppable market," he said. "All of the major players are here."

HEADLINE: City Agencies Are Warned Of More Cuts 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration is bracing city agencies for another round of spending cutbacks -- possibly totaling $500 million more -- as city officials prepare for the possibility that federal and state aid, as well as labor savings, will fail to materialize. 
 City officials sent letters yesterday to all agencies asking them to identify potential new areas for budget trims. Many departments and agencies have been struggling since November to come up with nearly $2 billion in cuts and savings to help make up for the blow to the city's finances by the combination of the national recession and the attack on the World Trade Center. 
 Mark Page, the city's budget director, said the city was trying to prepare a "contingency plan" in case it does not receive the aid and savings it needs to balance the city budget. In order to close a $4.76 billion deficit, the administration is relying on $800 million in savings that would require state or federal legislation, and $500 million that would need union approval. 
Some of those changes are considered long shots, like state tort-reform legislation that the Bloomberg administration says would save the city $100 million a year, and a federal increase in Medicaid funding. Hence the contingency plan.
Mr. Page said it could be "extremely problematic" for some agencies to identify further cuts, on top of the reductions they have already made, without resorting to layoffs.
The letters to agencies asked uniformed services like the Police Department and Fire Department, and the Board of Education to come up with an additional 2.5 percent in cuts. All other agencies are asked to explain how they would cut their budgets by 7.5 percent.
The call to identify further cuts was made as hundreds of elderly people, some using walkers and canes, came to City Hall to protest the first round of cuts proposed for the Department for the Aging, which faces closing seven senior centers and the elimination of a new weekend meal program for the elderly.
More than 300 of the elderly people packed the City Council chamber and heckled the new commissioner of the Department for the Aging, Edwin Mendez-Santiago, when he testified that "there will be no loss of service as a result of these closures." 
"Nooo!" the crowd roared, including a woman holding aloft a sign that said "Please Don't Close My Senior Center -- It's My Family."
Gifford Miller, the speaker of the City Council, said another round of cuts would bolster the Council's position that the Bloomberg administration should remain open to the possibility of raising some taxes. 
"I think it once again underlines our position that we shouldn't be taking different ways to increase revenues off the table," Mr. Miller said.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has expressed strong opposition to raising taxes, except for his proposal to raise the cigarette tax by $1.42 a pack. That plan, which he has described as more of a health initiative than a revenue raiser, requires state approval.
Officials identified several other risks to the city's finances yesterday. 
City officials warned that the economic stimulus plan that was overwhelmingly approved by Congress last week could have the unintended effect of opening a hole of roughly $300 million in the city budget next year. 
In an attempt to encourage investment, the federal law would lower the amount of federal taxes that businesses have to pay. The problem, city officials explained, is that city business taxes are pegged to federal taxes. So unless Albany gives the city permission to calculate its business taxes differently, the city would stand to lose revenue as well.
The Independent Budget Office, the city's nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group, released an analysis of Mayor Bloomberg's preliminary budget that warned that even if the city gets the savings it needs from the state and federal governments and the unions, it could still have a $397 million shortfall next fiscal year.
The fiscal office argued that the mayor's budget underestimates included the amount of money that the city would spend on police overtime next year by $100 million, on public assistance by $60 million, on education by $57 million, and on Medicaid costs by $39 million.
The report also sounded a note of caution on a budget proposal that had generally been well received by outside monitors when the mayor unveiled it on Feb. 13. "While all preliminary budgets present a number of trial balloons, giving mayors the opportunity to float a variety of proposals, this budget appears more preliminary than most," the budget office's report warned.
The city did get some good news from the business community, though.
UBS Paine Webber, which provides investment advice, published an analysis of Mayor Bloomberg's budget that concluded it was "a credible plan that should help allay investor concerns that a financial crisis is looming." 
The report found that the risks in the plan appeared "manageable" and said that the city should be able to protect its credit rating if its final budget resembles the plan.

HEADLINE: Reaching the Next Muslim Generation 

BYLINE:  By Mohamed Charfi; Mohamed Charfi, former president of the Tunisian Human Rights League and minister of education from 1989 to 1994, is author of "Islam et Liberte."

DATELINE: TUNIS 

 BODY:
Since Sept. 11, the world has come to know more about the educational systems prevalent today in Muslim countries and their role in promoting hostility toward the West. The educational system of Osama bin Laden's native Saudi Arabia is being criticized in the West, particularly in the United States. The Indian government last December announced an effort to reform the Muslim religious schools known as madrasas, though this is perhaps a mixed blessing given that the same government is using the schools to promote Hinduism as part of its nationalist program. Across the border in Pakistan, President Pervez Musharraf is pursuing reform of his country's educational system -- a project that will be watched by other Muslim nations. Education was a major subject of discussion in Mr. Musharraf's meeting with President Bush last month. This was itself something rather new.
 Muslim countries entered into their rebirth and modernization in the 19th century. The prosecution of apostasy and the use of corporal punishment fell away; power passed, in general, from religious councils and tribunals to parliaments and secular courts. These changes were everywhere incomplete, hesitant, fragile -- notably because their doctrinal foundation was accepted only grudgingly by the state and the elites, and still less by the general public. 
 This was clear in the common approach to education. A great effort was made to teach foreign languages and scientific subjects. But in teaching religion, history, philosophy and civics, traditional approaches prevailed. Schools taught Muslim law, the sharia, with its classic content; they presented Muslim history in a theological fashion as though we were still living under the Umayyads or the Abbasids. Muslim law was taught as sacred, and the idealized caliphate, the first centuries of Islam's expansion after Muhammad's death, was offered as a kind of heaven on earth.
The consequences of such teachings on the minds of young people in most Muslim-majority countries have been disastrous. Students learn that, in order to be good believers, they should be living under a caliph, that divine law makes it necessary to stone the adulterer and forbid lending at interest . . . only to discover, out in the street, a society directed by a civil government with a modern penal code and an economy founded on a banking system.
Many Muslim children still learn at school the ancient ideology of a triumphant Muslim empire, an ideology that held all non-Muslims to be in error and saw its mission as bringing Islam's light to the world. And yet young people see their governments working to live in peace with non-Muslim powers. Such discordant teachings do not prepare children to live in a changing world.
Osama bin Laden, like the 15 Saudis who participated in the criminal operations of Sept. 11, seems to have been the pure product of his schooling. While Saudi Arabia is officially a moderate state allied with America, it has also been one of the main supporters of Islamic fundamentalism because of its financing of schools following the intransigent Wahhabi doctrine. Saudi-backed madrasas in Pakistan and Afghanistan have played significant roles in the strengthening of radical Islam in those countries.
Even in countries where religious teaching is less exalted, the general orientation toward fundamentalist instruction is not altogether different.
Tunisia is among the rare exceptions. Since 1989, a radical reform aimed at modernizing the entire educational system has been undertaken. In religious matters, programs and textbooks emphasize the thinking of scholars influenced by the best of our late-medieval thinkers, like Averroes and Avicenna. Such writers have developed new readings of the Koran and given Islam a content that allows for discussion of sexual equality, human rights and the development of democracy. Tunisian history is taught so that a young Tunisian will see his country's part in all its fullness, forgetting neither the strategy of Hannibal nor the philosophy of St. Augustine. The science curriculum at higher grades incorporates Darwinian evolution and big-bang theories about the origin of the universe, neither of which is taught in traditional Islam-based programs. 
Our hope is that young Tunisians, through a more secular education, can be brought up to value individual liberty and openness to others. Combined with the emancipation of women and universal education -- all of which were part of President Habib Bourguiba's reforms, beginning in the late 50's -- this educational system is already helping to form a more modern society.
Unfortunately, the political structure has not kept pace. The police are omnipresent, the press and judiciary are controlled by the state and the country has become hostage to a system of personal power that comes from an earlier age. Fundamentalism is marginal in Tunisia, for the moment. But it will return if it becomes the last refuge of the discontented.
For now, we can hope that Mr. Musharraf will learn from Tunisia's recent mistakes -- like failing to make the political system more democratic -- as he can learn from its progress in creating schools that can help open the minds of a generation of students. Muslim countries today, after experiences with fundamentalism in Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere, need to begin a new phase of engagement with the world. Educational reform needs to be at the heart of this effort. Tunisia, though an imperfect example, offers important lessons in how it can be done.

HEADLINE: Chief Is Out As Kmart Tries To Get Footing For Comeback 

BYLINE:  By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
On Friday, Charles C. Conaway, the chief executive of Kmart, announced that 22,000 company employees would lose their jobs. On Saturday, he became one of them. 
 Kmart announced Mr. Conaway's departure yesterday after a board vote over the weekend. The company said he would be replaced by James B. Adamson, 54, a board member who took Mr. Conaway's spot as company chairman on Jan. 18, four days before Kmart filed for bankruptcy. 
 Kmart also named a president, Julian C. Day, who is a former chief operating officer at Sears Roebuck & Company, and a chief financial officer, Albert A. Koch, who heads Jay Alix & Associates, a firm specializing in turnarounds. 
The management changes signal a determination by Kmart's directors to lead the company out of its financial troubles, and they had been expected by many analysts. But while retail experts say Kmart's lack of a strong image is its single biggest liability, Mr. Adamson seemed to be in no hurry to define a new identity for the retailer yesterday, saying instead that his focus would first be on basics, like clean stores, and creating more stability for the 225,000 remaining workers. 
"It's going to take some time to analyze where the business is today," he said, when asked in a conference call how he would differentiate Kmart from competitors like Wal-Mart and Target. "I hope we will have the strategy complete by the end of this year. I want to make sure it's very thoughtful and that we have something that works."
At a time when shoppers worried about the economy have been flocking to discount stores, every chain in the category except Kmart has gained business. 
Wal-Mart's February sales in stores open at least a year rose 10.3 percent over February last year. Sales at Target stores increased 10 percent and sales at Kohl's rose 14.4 percent.
"It is absolutely critical to make Kmart stand out from the rest of the retail crowd," said Kurt Barnard, editor of Barnard's Retail Trend Report.
Mr. Adamson said he had spoken to licensees whose merchandise is sold exclusively at Kmart, including Martha Stewart, the home-furnishings and lifestyle arbiter, as well as Jaclyn Smith and Kathy Ireland, and executives from Joe Boxer, Disney and Sesame Street, all of whom design apparel for Kmart stores.
Martha Stewart, which generated about $1.5 billion in sales at Kmart last year, is considered essential for Kmart's turnaround. "Martha is very energized and she wants to help," Mr. Adamson said in an interview. "And I seek her help, because I think she is brilliant. I spent quality time with her." 
Analysts said they expected announcements about strategic changes in the next few weeks. "We're going to be watching as the new management team articulates its strategy to turn around the fortunes of Kmart and restore confidence with its key constituents," said Angela Jameson, an analyst with Moody's Investors Service who downgraded Kmart's debt rating several times before the bankruptcy filing. 
Mr. Conaway, who submitted his resignation letter to the board on Saturday night, is leaving with only about a third of the compensation package he would have been entitled to under his employment contract. According to documents filed with the federal bankruptcy judge in Chicago overseeing Kmart's reorganization, Mr. Conaway would have received $11 million to as much as $37 million. But the severance policy in the bankruptcy filing entitles him to about two-thirds less. The policy has been approved by the bankruptcy court.
"He did not want to leave with anything but the support of the board and his dignity," Mr. Adamson said, "and I believe he did."
Mr. Adamson is Kmart's third chief executive in two years. Mr. Conaway replaced Floyd Hall in early 2000, and promptly pledged to turn around Kmart's sagging fortunes with a program that included a focus on mothers as target customers. He signed exclusive licensing contracts and broadened existing ones, like Kmart's alliance with Martha Stewart. Mr. Conaway said he would accomplish his goals by the end of this year, but by December Kmart's sales were lower than the year before and the company was short of cash. Vendors complained that special terms were being demanded of them, and in early January, Kmart said it would not deliver the earnings analysts expected for fiscal 2001. The company also said it was seeking additional financing and reviewing its business plans. The stock began falling and sank to $1.74 by Jan. 21, the day the board voted to file for bankruptcy. 
Mr. Adamson joined Kmart's board in 1996 and has led other turnarounds, including one at Revco, the drugstore chain that was bought by CVS when Mr. Conaway was chief operating officer there. He also worked at the Burger King unit of Diageo and revamped the Advantica Restaurant Group, owners of the Denny's chain, in 1997 after Denny's was sued by a group of black customers who said they were refused service because of their race. 
In taking over at Kmart, he said that he recognized the challenges he faced. "I know it's a big mountain to climb," he said. 
As for strategic decisions like Mr. Conaway's plan to wage a price war with Wal-Mart, which eroded earnings and gained little to no market share for Kmart, Mr. Adamson said it had become "more aggressively challenging" during the fall, when the lower prices on more than 50,000 products seemed to be doing nothing to help sales. "We went too far, too fast on the lowering of prices," he said.
One analyst praised Mr. Adamson, calling him a strategist who was wise to think carefully before settling on an image for Kmart. "I'd rather have him do that than come out spouting on something that doesn't make a lot of sense," said Bobbie Lenga of Russell Reynolds & Associates. Mr. Conaway, she added, "made some good changes while he was there, but the issue has always been, they are between a rock and a hard place."

HEADLINE: In Philadelphia, a New Taste of Freedom 

BYLINE:  By REGINA SCHRAMBLING 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
TWO restaurants could not be more different than Morimoto and Django. One is a temple of design, with sushi and sake in supporting roles, and the other is a personal statement that the reinvention of creme brulee as a napoleon is a goal more worthy than fine linens and the ultimate wine cellar. But together they represent a new excitement at the table here.
 No wonder Philadelphia appears to be the one city in the Northeast rebounding with real energy lately. 
 If location is everything in the restaurant business, this is the rare situation where the adage applies to the entire city. Philadelphia is almost equidistant from New York and Washington by train, and the Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation says one-quarter of the nation's population lives within a five-hour drive. Which is the reason, some say, that restaurants here are thriving while cities that depend on flying tourists, like San Francisco, have been struggling since Sept. 11. Django, for example, has a one-month wait for weekend reservations. 
Other feeding indicators are just as positive. This weekend, the Book and the Cook, an annual culinary expo, is expecting the number of participants arriving by bus to increase 25 percent over last year's levels. Hotel occupancy rates are down only 8 percent since September, compared with 24 percent in New York, according to one study. And the Pennsylvania Convention Center is fully booked through the end of the year. 
Since Sept. 11, Amtrak reports, it has pushed past the airlines to dominate travel between New York and Washington, and while it does not track how many passengers detrain in Philadelphia, it does say 30th Street Station is the second-busiest in the system, with nearly four million passengers yearly. 
What was most encouraging in three days of trying new restaurants here was how seldom I had to eat alone. Morimoto was still hopping at 10:30 when I left. Even a neighborhood pub like Standard Tap, which is making a name for its cooking, had waiters busily scribbling orders at 5 o'clock when I stopped in on Tuesday, and the chef reported she had run out of food by 1 a.m.
Eating here is like a time trip back to the glory days of the late 1970s, when I worked on newspapers here and restaurants with equal parts personality and imaginative cuisine were thriving on virtually every block. Those were the wonder years before white flight, when people walked to the Frog and the Commissary, to the Astral Plane and Knave of Hearts, to Friday, Saturday, Sunday. All those were passionate places where the decor might be charmingly improvisational but the food was always both idiosyncratic and polished. 
The same entrepreneurial excitement is palpable again, and the city has more of a mix of high-end restaurants, and more movement among kitchens by creative chefs. The change started in 1998, with the opening of sleek, innovative restaurants like Fork and Buddakan in neighborhoods off the well-trod tracks. Now the famed old standards like Le Bec-Fin, Striped Bass and Susanna Foo actually seem to be losing buzz to B.Y.O.B. places. If nothing quite equals the dramatic restaurant in Jonathan Franzen's best seller "The Corrections," it is easy to see why one of his main characters is a Philadelphia chef. 
"From my standpoint, we've bounced back from where it was before Sept. 11," said Stephen Starr, whose Starr Restaurant Group owns Morimoto and six other establishments. "The week of Feb. 14 was the biggest week ever for my company." And that is despite the fact, he said, that patrons are ordering cheaper wines and spending less in a limping economy. They are still venturing out in impressive numbers. 
Philadelphia has not been spared the invasion of the upscale chains afflicting every other major American city; Capital Grille, Roy's and the Palm are all clustered on Broad Street south of City Hall. But one secret of the city's success is that so many restaurateurs do not cater to the conventioneers and tourists who would be just as happy with the same menu they know from back home in Hawaii. 
"Philadelphia is very dependent on the local population," Mr. Starr said. And somehow a cross-section of visitors from New York, Washington, Boston and farther afield always seeks out the local favorites. That is partly why Tony Goldman, a New York developer who owned SoHo Kitchen & Bar, opened Trust here two weeks ago. Working with Guillermo Pernot, the chef from the highly rated Pasion!, he said he intended to focus on Philadelphians. Anyone would feel at home while tucking into tapas in his elaborately designed restaurant. 
At restaurant after restaurant, the story is similar to the one Greg Salisbury told me at his three-month-old Rx, near the University of Pennsylvania in West Philadelphia. An editor for the Jewish Exponent, he wanted a place where he would like to eat, and where neighbors would be happy, and finally got up the nerve to scratch his restaurant itch when he spotted an empty pharmacy near his home on a block barren of any food outlets. 
He hired a chef, Ross Essner, who had worked for one of Mr. Starr's competitors, Neil Stein of the Meal Ticket group, at a conceptual restaurant called Bleu. He bought a bathroom sink on eBay and mismatched china where he could; he hung his spare, sunny room with paintings for sale.
At lunch, the waitress recites the entire menu from her notepad, with the most ambitious dish being a frittata rich with bacon, leeks and Cheddar cheese. But the cooking was careful and the price was right: $3. Already other restaurateurs and chefs are making the pilgrimage for brunch and dinner, when Mr. Essner concocts real food like Poconos trout with saffron-mussel broth. 
Aimee Olexy and Bryan Sikora, the owners of Django at the other end of the city, also wanted a "personal" and "food-driven" restaurant, and they have what may be the hottest ticket in town.
The couple met and married while working in Denver and Boulder, Ms. Olexy said. They came home to Philadelphia to open a place but first worked for Mr. Starr, Mr. Sikora as sous chef at Tangerine and she as the group's director of restaurants, opening Pod and Alma de Cuba. It was enough to convince them that the corporate world was too large. Last May they rented a former accessories store and decorated it with a vintage stove and French posters, with worn tea towels for tablecloths. 
Now they live above their own restaurant, named for the guitarist Django Reinhardt (the D is silent), and work late into the night. Diners from Philadelphia, Washington, New York and Harrisburg come by first, and then local chefs, servers and bartenders. All are drawn by dishes like the juicy whole roasted quail, fat with a bread and giblet stuffing, or the ethereal gnocchi made with local Highfield Dairy goat cheese. 
"Bryan likes handmade food," Ms. Olexy said. "He thinks first of the made ingredient: bread or gnocchi or crepes." Then he adds on the quail or the beef cheeks. 
Mr. Sikora, like many other chefs here, buys from Kennett Square mushroom growers in Pennsylvania, fishermen from the Jersey Shore and the Chesapeake Bay and farmers of South Jersey and Lancaster County to the west.
One of the mysteries of Philadelphia, in fact, is why restaurants do so well when home cooks are so blessed. They can shop at the Italian Market in South Philadelphia, where produce and seafood are hawked from open-air stalls and where spices, coffee, cookware and cheeses are on display in heavily stocked shops, or at the Reading Terminal Market, which has Amish vegetables and quality bread (from Le Bus or Metropolitan Bakery), as well as seafood, meats, cheese and just about any ethnic ingredient. A block of South Street that I would have been afraid to walk on in 1980 is now taken up with a sparkling Fresh Fields/ Whole Foods Market that makes Manhattan's seem puny.
Like Rx and so many of the more creative restaurants that have opened here since a resurgence began in 1998, Django is B.Y.O.B. The owners said they did not want to tie up space and money with a wine cellar. Their patrons appreciate the savings -- my three-course dinner cost $37 before tip. 
The downside was that I had to stop at a state-controlled wine shop before I had any idea what the menu was like. It carried only two chilled whites, and the $15 Clos du Bois chardonnay was not a good match for any course. Another night, when I asked for red Burgundy, the clerk pointed me to a wall of jugs from California.
But B.Y.O.B. is not shorthand for a great dining experience. Pif in South Philadelphia also has patrons bring their own, but neither the savings nor the Beaujolais could redeem the cooking. Brandade was dry and chewy,and duck was tough and gamy. Thinking of all the rave reviews, I could only surmise that the emperor wears no apron.
Standard Tap has no such problem. Local beers and good wine are the focus along with the food. It is the usual story: partners who lived in the bleak neighborhood known as Northern Liberties wanted a place to hang out and eat, and opened their own. As chef they hired Carolynn Angle, a veteran of Neil Stein's Striped Bass and his short-lived Fishmarket, who said her philosophy is to buy the best and keep it simple. 
The blackboard menu was a masterpiece of terseness -- "smelts," "brisket," "spinach and mushroom sandwich" -- but what came out of the kitchen filled in the blanks. Seafood chowder was a huge bowl of shrimp, white fish and oysters in a creamy base fragrant with herbs and smoky with bacon and chipotle chilies. 
Ms. Angle said she reveled in being "in an honest little place, working long hours but good hours." She added: "You want to do what you do best and be left alone."
Many other chefs are still drawn to the culture she fled. Neil Stein has given a succession of chefs a stage at his newest place, Avenue B, which was recommended repeatedly. The menu is as soporific as the setting is sophisticated, though. At lunch the choice was essentially chicken, pizza and pasta. (And the pappardelle were so disappointing that the manager charged me nothing for my meal.)
Mr. Starr attracted Masaharu Morimoto, best known from Nobu in Manhattan and from "Iron Chef" on the Food Network, when the New Yorker decided to go out on his own. Now he has the ultimate stage set, a cavernous white room on Chestnut Street where plexiglass booths change colors periodically and the sushi bar looks like an altar. 
The food is still a little uneven. But there are winners like a salad of mizuna and unctuous salmon toro dressed with a yuzu vinaigrette. Morimoto even makes a production of tofu: a waiter brings a hot bowl filled with soy milk, stirs in a salt reduction and lets it sit seven minutes, until it thickens to the consistency of firm custard, then two sauces are poured over in succession. Crepes Suzette was never so dramatic. 
Mr. Morimoto said there was one reason he had headed south: "I can make my own style in Philadelphia, independent of Nobu and 'Iron Chef.' "
And if he makes it here, he and Mr. Starr intend to open a second Morimoto in New York, in the meatpacking district, in the months ahead. It's like the old days of tryouts in Philadelphia, but then Mr. Starr is best known for restaurants as theater. Pod, in West Philadelphia, attracted national attention for its stark design and booths with individual lighting controls. The menu is just as sprightly, with Asian dishes like scallops crusted with sesame seeds and laid onto edamame pancakes. 
Mr. Starr also brought Douglas Rodriguez south last year to oversee the menu at Alma de Cuba, next door to Brasserie Perrier, owned by the renowned chef from Le Bec-Fin. Jose Garces came along, from Chicama and Pipa, to collaborate on the menu, with creations like crispy crab empanadas on a powerful chili sauce cooled by cucumber and onion slices, or little tacos of smoked marlin with jalapenos. 
The combination of heat and low light makes Alma a seductive experience. Catchy Cuban music plays; mojitos flow. The lounge is all low chairs, for seeing and being seen, and red votive candles for glamour, with black-and-white images of shining, happy Cuban faces projected on the walls between white shutters. It may be more Hong Kong than Havana, but it works. 
Four blocks away, Trust felt like a throbbing club by comparison. A huge circular bar was thronged when I walked in, and people were taking tours of the restrooms, downstairs in what felt like an empty swimming pool, with a blindingly white powder room and communal sinks. 
The cooks and servers were still struggling to harmonize in their first week, but the extremely long menu sounded promising. Serrano ham on arugula and melon with a smoked paprika vinaigrette was a lively starter, and citrus beignet kebabs were a borderline-brilliant finish: chocolate-coated slices of dried orange interspersed on skewers with chunks of deep-fried pineapple on mandarin orange sauce. I could almost forgive the kitchen for the duck with green olives and almonds that was not exactly the freshest bird in the flock. 
Those three courses with two glasses of wine and tip cost $55. And that is another reason that restaurants here are not deserted. Real estate is cheaper than in New York, or even Washington, for both restaurants and chefs. Mr. Garces said he rented an apartment just off prestigious Rittenhouse Square for what he paid to live in Queens. 
"Over the next 10 years," he said, "Philadelphia is going to get a lot of New York chefs who are tired of the grind and are looking for a slower pace and a better lifestyle. In this business, if you can find a situation where you don't have to kill yourself, it makes a lot of sense." 
Philadelphia may be in the middle on the map, but it shoots for the top in the kitchen.

GOAT CHEESE GNOCCHI WITH CARAMELIZED ONION AND THYME
Adapted from Django
Time: 1 hour

1 pound Highfield Dairy goat cheese or other creamy, tangy goat cheese, at room temperature
2 large eggs
Fine sea salt
1/2 cup flour, plus additional as needed
3 tablespoons butter
2 onions, peeled and thinly sliced
2/3 cup vegetable stock
1/2 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves, or more as needed
4 ounces Plugra or Echire butter or other high-butterfat butter
2 cups clean, dry, baby spinach leaves, loosely packed
2 ounces finely grated Parmigiano- Reggiano cheese
Freshly ground black pepper.

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine goat cheese, eggs and a generous pinch of salt. Beat with a stiff whisk until mixture is smooth. Begin by adding 1/2 cup of flour, and gently kneading in. Continue adding flour a tablespoon at a time, up to a full cup, until there is the first sign of a malleable nonsticky mass of dough. Do not add too much flour or overknead; dough should be soft, airy and very light. Cover dough, and refrigerate for 30 minutes.
2. While dough is being chilled, prepare caramelized onions. In a large skillet over medium-low heat, melt 3 tablespoons of butter. Add onions and stir until coated. Allow to cook gently, stirring occasionally, until onions are very soft and beginning to brown, about 20 minutes. Remove from heat, and set aside at room temperature.
3. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Set aside a large bowl of ice water. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a rectangle 1/2 inch thick. Using a long knife, cut into 1/2-inch-by-1-inch pieces. To shape gnocchi, dust each piece with flour and roll on the back of a fork to make a rounded oblong lightly scored by the tines of the fork. Place on a floured tray, and continue until all dough is used. Boil gnocchi immediately until they are fluffy and firm, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer to the ice water bath. As soon as gnocchi are cool, drain and set aside.
4. Place a large pan over medium-low heat, and add vegetable stock, thyme and gnocchi. Saute gently until hot, and add Plugra. When butter has melted, add spinach and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and toss gently. Transfer to a large serving platter, and top with a mound of the reserved caramelized onions. Serve immediately.

Yield: 4 servings.

Note: Highfield Dairy goat cheese is available from Highfield Dairy, (717) 485-5792.

SEAFOOD CHOWDER
Adapted from Standard Tap
Time: 1 1/2 hours

1/4 pound applewood smoked bacon, diced
1 Spanish onion, diced
4 stalks celery, diced
4 large carrots, diced
3 Idaho or Yukon Gold potatoes, scrubbed and diced (not peeled)
3 cloves garlic, chopped
Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme
1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano
1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil
1 chipotle chili in adobo sauce, chopped
2 1/2 cups heavy cream
6 cups fish or vegetable stock
12 ounces white fish, like flounder, cut in large chunks
12 oysters, shucked
12 medium shrimp or scallops
4 scallions, trimmed and chopped.

1. Place bacon in a large heavy kettle over medium heat, and cook, stirring, until fat is rendered. Add onion, celery, carrots, potatoes and garlic. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook, stirring continually, until vegetables are coated with fat and give off liquid, about 30 minutes. Stir in herbs and chipotle with at least 1 teaspoon of its sauce. Cook, stirring often, 10 minutes.
2. Raise heat and add 2 cups cream. Bring to a boil, and cook 5 minutes. Add stock. Lower heat to medium, and cover pot. Cook until vegetables are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Season again. Add remaining cream and more adobo if desired. Cook 15 minutes.
3. Lower heat, and add all fish and shellfish. Cook just until seafood is tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir in scallions and serve.

Yield: 4 to 6 servings.

HEADLINE: At Regis, Academic Rigor and Service, All Free 

BYLINE:  By TARA BAHRAMPOUR 

 BODY:
In 1914, an anonymous benefactor founded a school offering a free rigorous education to boys who were Roman Catholic and who lived in New York City. She did not have to describe them as poor. Most of the city's Catholics were Irish, Italian or German immigrants with little money or education.
 Today, Regis High School, occupying a stately Classical Revival building on East 84th Street and Park Avenue, is one of the city's most desirable high schools, catching the eye of thousands of eighth graders a year for its 135 slots and attracting students who prefer it to such elite schools as Stuyvesant High. It is still free. But its makeup has changed with the times. 
 "As the Catholic population in New York climbed the ladder, so did our student body," said the Rev. Vincent Biagi, the principal. 
Today, the city's Catholic population includes many middle-class and wealthy families, a fact that has prompted the school in recent years to make an even stronger effort to recruit the poor and working-class students its founder envisioned.
Each year, Eric DiMichele, director of admissions, sends out feelers to a far-flung network of churches and schools, holding receptions in places as distant as Poughkeepsie and as rough as the South Bronx. The school limits applications to 800 a year; generally, only students with grades and standardized test scores above the 90th percentile may apply, and they must excel in an entrance exam and submit teacher recommendations and proof of baptism.
Tipped off by priests or school principals, immigrant families from Poland, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and Croatia find their way to Regis, hoping their sons will follow in the footsteps of alumni like the Rev. Joseph A. O'Hare, president of Fordham University; Robert Giroux of Farrar, Straus & Giroux publishers; and the Rev. Timothy S. Healy, a former president of the New York Public Library. "The most moving phone calls for me are ones in foreign languages that are indecipherable to me," Mr. DiMichele said.
Still, with high academic standards and a pool limited to a single religion, the school is not as diverse as officials would like. Although most Hispanic New Yorkers are Catholic, most black New Yorkers are not; only 3 percent of Regis students are black. The school is 14 percent Hispanic and 10 percent Asian. 
A mentoring program for middle school boys concentrates on attracting poorer students, and applicants' economic situations are considered in what Mr. DiMichele called a "sliding scale" of achievements relative to opportunities. "We look at what advantages a boy has had in life and what has he done with them," he said.
Once they arrive, however, "there is no sense of one attending on the bill of another," said Hee-Sun Hong, director of college counseling. "There are certainly some students who can afford private school, but the overwhelming culture is of not showing it off." 
Rather, the culture revolves around the demanding education Regis is known for. Latin students read Ovid and Cicero in the original; English classes cover Dante, V. S. Naipaul, Milan Kundera, Dostoyevsky and Graham Greene. In a sophomore history course covering the Salem witch trials, students read trial transcripts and 17th-century sermons.
"Rather than passively digesting textbook information, they look at all this and slowly begin to see, aha, there are patterns developing here," said the Rev. Arthur Bender, the class's teacher.
But Regis is not only about academics. Although the average College Boards score last year was 1,383 and many students go on to Ivy League schools, "the goal is not to get every student who walks in the door into Harvard," Father Biagi said. "It's also to help them develop as human beings, to grow as young Christian men."
What that means has changed in recent decades as the teaching of Catholic doctrine has centered less on unquestioning adherence to church doctrine. As a school run on Jesuit principles, Regis encourages students to grapple independently with questions of morals and ethics.
On a recent morning, debate in a senior theology class took off from the writings of Dorothy Day, the Catholic peace activist. With their cropped hair, button-up shirts and slacks (T-shirts and jeans are not allowed), the boys looked fairly similar, but their accents bespoke a mix of the suburbs, the Upper East Side and the inner city, and their views on nonviolence during wartime ranged as widely.
"I think patriotism can be dangerous," one boy said. "It's one step lower than nationalism. If you think your country's so great, it can lead you to harm others."
Another said: "You can still be a patriot. You just think that bombing Afghanistan isn't the best thing for our country."
As talk circled from St. Augustine to Nazi Germany to the birth of existentialism, the tone resembled that of a college seminar. 
High standards are also reflected in students' extracurricular literary output; besides the newspaper and yearbook, there are separate magazines for literature, music and art, fantasy and horror, sports, and political opinion.
Unlike many Catholic schools, Regis, named for a 17th-century saint, is financially independent from the Archdiocese of New York, receiving half its $7 million budget from its endowment and half from alumni contributions. (One student joked, "We pay tuition 20 years down the line.") The school's motto, "Men for others," emphasizes the Jesuit service ethic and places a strong emphasis on community service programs and retreats. But the degree to which Regis informs students' spirituality is up to them.
John Fahy, a senior, considers himself middle of the road on the religiosity scale. "There are certainly people here who I'd call Bible beaters, and those who are atheist, or at least very separated from their faith," he said. "There are people who are pro-life, there are people who are pro-choice, there are people who are papist, there are people who don't believe in the pope's views."
A continuing question has been whether to admit girls or establish an equivalent girls' school. The city has well-regarded Catholic girls' schools, but none are free. And while a few students said they wished the school admitted girls, most agreed that the single-sex atmosphere allowed them to focus on their work. 
"Anyway," said Anthony Tavormina, a senior, "When you go to Regis, all the girls' parents automatically like you."

HEADLINE: Ending Chronic Homelessness 

 BODY:
The Bush administration declared in its 2003 budget proposal that it considers "ending chronic homelessness in the next decade a top objective." This may seem a surprising goal for a Republican administration in a time of economic downturn. The good news is that it is not rhetoric. Ending chronic homelessness is actually achievable, and it can be done in ways that will actually save money.
 The solution, based on recent research and pilot programs, centers on two approaches. One is the development of "supported" housing, meaning shelters that include treatment. The other is to monitor people being released from prisons, mental institutions and drug treatment centers to make sure they don't wind up sleeping on the streets. The money is there. The ideas are there. Success will depend on breaking down walls within the federal government and between Washington, states and cities. 
 A decade ago, homelessness was the focus of an ideological divide. The left said homeless people were just like everyone else except they didn't have a place to live, so the government should provide it. The right said chronic homelessness was the result of personal pathology that couldn't be helped while the market would adjust and provide for all others.
There remains disagreement over homeless families and the degree to which federal subsidies should be used to solve the broader housing crisis. But a consensus has crystallized on the so-called chronically homeless, single men and women who repeatedly sleep on streets and in temporary shelters, and this opportunity must not be wasted.
Experts now agree that for the chronically homeless, who number 200,000, lack of a place to live is a symptom of a complex set of problems, like addiction and mental illness, which must be treated in conjunction with their housing. The solution is to offer permanent housing that is accompanied by support services like counseling and therapy. 
This turns out to cost less money than temporary shelters. But because the money for shelters comes from a mix of sources -- federal, state and local -- no single agency or bureaucracy pays the whole bill. The shelter system continues to grow simply because it looks like the cheapest alternative to each of the many contributors. Making the switch away from shelters means getting various departments of the federal government -- Health and Human Services, Veterans Affairs, Justice -- to collaborate with one another. They must all work with Housing and Urban Development, which has traditionally been seen as the main provider.
That kind of collaboration is always hard to achieve in large bureaucracies, but the Bush administration seems to be serious about making it work. It has begun by establishing an interagency working group on the homeless to be run by a widely respected advocate from Massachusetts, Philip Mangano, who starts work this week. 
Mr. Mangano says one of his priorities will be people discharged from prisons, mental hospitals and abuse programs as well as 18-year-olds who "age out" of the foster care system and are often released with no place to live. One of the most depressing and frustrating aspects of institutional life in America is the way organizations that are supposed to care for, correct or rehabilitate troubled people wind up showing them the door when their time is up, without making sure they have the minimal tools they need to live in the outside world. The Bush administration's plan is to use federal money as an inducement -- both stick and carrot -- to get prisons, hospitals and treatment centers to plan for long-term housing for inmates from the day they first enter their systems. With the money that HUD will save by not spending on more temporary shelters, it can construct, renovate and subsidize the supported housing all agree is needed. 
This approach sounds both smart and compassionate. It will help a vulnerable population expected to grow as prison releases increase. It will remove from city streets people who are sleeping there. Finally, it could form the basis for further collaboration on the less chronic but equally urgent problem of housing for the very poorest who may not be technically homeless but live on the edge.

HEADLINE: Business Travel; 
Corporate fliers are increasingly willing to stay over Saturday night to get less expensive fares.

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
AIRLINES put the so-called Saturday night stay requirement on their discount advance-purchase fares for one reason only: They want business travelers to always pay top dollar.
 By making a traveler spend a Saturday night on the road to get a cheaper fare, airlines literally bank on the likelihood that even those business travelers who are able to plan trips weeks in advance probably won't do so. On a business trip, who wants to spend an idle extra weekend away from home? 
 Well, it seems that a growing number of business travelers either want to, or will, stay the weekend, according to a new report from Forrester Research Inc. 
The Forrester report, based in part on a scientific poll last July of more than 1,500 business travelers, suggests that about a third of business travelers -- a segment that is younger and less likely to be married than the average -- are quite willing to spend that weekend on the road. 
And increasingly, said Henry Harteveldt, Forrester senior travel analyst, companies are realizing that they can still save money even if they offer to pay for hotel, meals and other extra expenses for that leisure weekend. 
With a business fare that doesn't require a Saturday night stay, "you're looking at transcontinental fares of $2,300 from, let's say, San Francisco to New York," Mr. Harteveldt said. "But if you plan your trip in advance, and don't mind staying over the weekend, the fare drops to maybe $458." 
This segment of the market partly reflects people who relish the opportunity to combine business and pleasure on the road, Mr. Harteveldt said. "They really look forward to business travel, and they don't mind it if their companies say, stay over a Saturday night," if the company is paying the extra costs, he added.
The Saturday night stay requirement has been a buttress of the airline fare structure for over 20 years. Last August, however, after six months of declining revenue from business travel amid complaints about soaring fares, major airlines suddenly dropped the requirement on a relative handful of selected and highly competitive routes clustered in main hubs. 
Industry analysts suggested then that the move to eliminate the Saturday night stay could accelerate. But the airline industry collapsed after Sept. 11; many of those attractive business fares that did not require a Saturday night stay also collapsed. Total losses for the year exceeded $7 billion. In the months after September, with business travel off even more, airlines instead furiously cut leisure fares on certain competitive routes in desperate attempts just to fill airplanes.
Now, with business travel coming back, and with many leisure fares so low, business travelers have been more unhappy than ever about the prices they pay.
Aware of that, airlines have begun to shift attention once again to business travelers as the busy warm-weather travel season approaches. For example, United Airlines said yesterday that it would add about 15 percent more flights from its Chicago hub and cut some fares this summer, in a bid to attract returning business travelers. 
"We believe that if we put the schedules in that address what the business flier is looking for, it benefits the leisure flier as well, because they'll have the opportunity to have the same kind of multiplicity of opportunities," said Chris Bowers, United's senior vice president for marketing.
"The business fliers want to go when they want to go," he added. "The business travelers have been telling us since we pulled the schedule down following Sept. 11 that we were thwarting their ability sometimes to be as flexible on the road as they need to be."
This week, United and several competitors also extended special discount fares intended to attract business fliers on highly competitive routes. On many of those special fares, the Saturday night stay requirement has been dropped for the extent of the sale.
The new Forrester research, however, indicates that whatever the future resilience of the hated Saturday night stay, some business travelers have decided that if they can't beat it, they'll join it. 
Because some business travelers are buying the advance-purchase fares with the weekend stays, "airlines can no longer easily tell at a glance who's a business traveler and who's a leisure traveler," Mr. Harteveldt said.
"Business travelers have reached the breaking point" with fares, he added. Some of them, he said, now "are taking this opportunity to reinvent themselves from a pricing standpoint."
Susan Black, a business-strategy consultant from Woodcliff Lake, N.J., who travels about 100,000 miles a year on business, is one of them. 
"In the past I never entertained Saturday night stay-overs because I try to balance my life with my work," said Ms. Black, who is married and has two children, ages 2 and 4. "But now all of a sudden it's beginning to look a lot more attractive, when you see a round-trip fare that jumps from $200 to $2,000" between the leisure and business rates, she said. 
The fare discrepancies "are more pronounced" since September, said Ms. Black, who still has to fly often on short notice and pay the top fare. But whenever possible, when business needs and family itinerary allow it, she now opts for the cheap fare that requires a weekend stay. 
"Sometimes I'll take one of my kids, and try to make it a bit of bonding time," she said.
It just requires more planning. "Luckily, we have a great nanny," she said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Technology Shares Fall, Though the Dow Edges Higher

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Technology stocks slumped yesterday on pessimistic forecasts from some prominent companies, but blue chips managed a slight gain as investors took refuge in areas like drug stocks.
 "Warnings from Nokia and Lucent are reminding investors that the tech recovery is going to lag the economic recovery," said John C. Forelli, senior portfolio manager at Independence Investment in Boston, "because business spending will continue to lag consumer spending." 
 Word late Monday that regulators were investigating the accounting of WorldCom punished the company's stock price. Qwest Communications International also said it had received a request from the Securities and Exchange Commission for information about its accounting. Together, the investigations reinforced accounting fears of the sort set off by the Enron collapse. 
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 32.37 points, or 1.68 percent, to 1,897.12. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 2.68 points, or 0.23 percent, to 1,165.58, while the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average rose 21.11 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,632.35, its highest close since June.
Declining issues narrowly exceeded those advancing on the New York Stock Exchange. On Nasdaq the breadth was worse, with decliners leading advancers by a margin of more than 4 to 3. Volume was 1.34 billion shares, up from 1.21 billion.
I.B.M. -- whose expanded annual report for 2001, the 10(k), contained no damaging information, according to analysts -- buoyed the Dow with a gain of $3.26, closing at $108.50. Also lifting the index were gains in safe-haven stocks like Merck, up 75 cents, to $63.49, and Procter & Gamble, up $1.18, to $85.28.
Microsoft fell $1.80, to $62.54. Rick Sherlund of Goldman, Sachs, citing a slump in personal computer demand, said he expected Microsoft to guide views for the 2003 fiscal year below Wall Street estimates.
Cisco Systems, the leading manufacturer of Internet equipment, also disclosed more information than in the past, but its shares fell 65 cents, to $16.77, dropping along with other high-technology producers.
Lucent Technologies was the most active issue on the New York Stock Exchange, falling 66 cents, to $5.60, on trading of nearly 70 million shares after it said its quarterly revenue would be lower than expected because communications companies were still reducing capital spending.
Nokia of Finland, the No. 1 maker of mobile phones, said that while it might surpass its quarterly profit target, revenue was weaker than anticipated, with network sales expected to drop 25 percent. Its stock fell $1.41, to $22.09.
WorldCom said it was not aware of anything that would cause an inquiry by the S.E.C., but added it would respond to the request "as promptly as possible." Its shares sank $1.08, to $7.93, and were the most heavily traded on the Nasdaq market.
Nortel Networks, one of the largest makers of telecommunications equipment, fell 36 cents, to $5.65. Moody's Investors Service lowered its credit ratings to one notch above junk status and warned it might cut them again on worries that weakness in markets affecting its principal customers would be "deeper and more protracted than expected." --------------------

Treasury Rally Stalls (By Bloomberg News)
A rally in Treasuries stalled yesterday as a $6 billion bond sale by GE Capital, General Electric's financing arm, lured money away from government debt. "The G.E. sale stopped the Treasury rally cold," said Peter Petas, a managing director at CreditSights Inc. "Investors shifted focus to the $6 billion" sale, which could happen as soon as today.
By late in the day, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note eased 1/32, to a price of 96 22/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.31 percent from 5.30 percent on Monday. The 30-year bond eased 2/32, to a price of 95 4/32. Its yield was unchanged at 5.72 percent. The two-year note was also unchanged.
Following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of four-week bills:

HEADLINE: City Official Considers Ending Several Investment Programs 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
The president of the city's Economic Development Corporation yesterday said he was considering ending several programs started during the Giuliani administration that invested city tax dollars in small companies or emerging industries. 
 The official, Andrew M. Alper, a former investment banker at Goldman, Sachs & Company who was recruited by the Bloomberg administration early this year, told the City Council's economic development committee he thought the private sector was better at making such investments. 
 City dollars, he said, might be better spent on other business incentives, like helping young companies that locate in New York with property-tax breaks or subsidies to make affordable housing available to workers. 
"The question I'm looking at is what role the city should play in trying to incubate businesses," he said at a hearing to review the agency's budgets. "It's not clear to me that is a role the city is best able to play." 
James Sanders Jr., the chairman of the City Council's economic development committee, raised questions about the investment programs. In particular, he asked about the Emerging Industries Fund, which received $10 million in tax dollars to invest in biotechnology, telecommunications and other companies during the Giuliani administration. The fund made one investment, of $600,000, while paying $1.2 million in management fees to an outside investment firm. About $8.2 million was returned to the city's treasury.
Mr. Alper said that he was re-evaluating programs including the NYC Discovery Fund, which he said had only limited success investing in technology and telecommunications companies. And he questioned whether programs like Digital NYC, which provide relocation incentives to companies in the city, offered "the right bang for the buck."
Mr. Alper also said that he would announce today a reorganization of the development corporation into three operating divisions. He said two divisions would focus on real estate and infrastructure, with a third intended to help keep companies in the city using a client-services model, more like an advertising agency or investment bank than a government body.

HEADLINE: Real Estate In Manhattan Is Rebounding 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
Despite predictions of a real estate recession in Manhattan after Sept. 11, co-op and condominium sales have rebounded strongly in the last two months, with the number of sales up and prices gradually rising -- in some cases even surpassing those of a year ago, when the sales market was still hot.
 Open houses are full to bursting, and the agents say they are awash with bids and bidding wars. Even the town house and luxury markets, hit hard by weak Wall Street bonuses at the end of 2001 and a general fear to commit, are starting to move, agents say. 
 Molly Newman, a broker for the Corcoran Group, said she was shut out on Friday, when her client was told a bid had been accepted for a five-room apartment in the East 60's. The apartment, which had gone on the market the previous Monday, had 15 bids five days later. "I'm totally bowled over," she said. "The market didn't start gathering steam until Jan. 15." 
Many had said that the combined effects of the weakening economy and the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center last Sept. 11 would lead to a real estate crash. Indeed, in areas close to ground zero, the market has trembled. Elsewhere, however, sales are stronger than expected and brokers report that even in TriBeCa and Battery Park City, close to the trade center, sales are finally picking up. 
Statisticians, brokers and would-be buyers credit the rebound to low interest rates and a dearth of great apartments. They also report that many prospective purchasers have said they are taking their money out of the stock market and investing in real estate instead.
Jeffrey M. Locker, 46, a Manhattan lawyer, agreed. Mr. Locker, who is looking for a two-bedroom apartment himself, said one reason for the flurry of buying is the disenchantment with high-flying, high-risk stocks as an investment, driving people to invest instead in homes.
"Real estate just seems more stable than the stock market right now," he said.
Mr. Locker knows firsthand about the hot market. "I lost an apartment a week and a half ago," he said. "Right before that, I thought I had a deal on another one. The seller had accepted my offer and the agent said she would stop showing it. The next thing I knew, they had gotten an offer $65,000 higher than mine. I matched it, but they never even called me back."
The size and scope of any surge in the market depend on the source compiling the statistics, but an upward trend is clear. For example, the median price of Manhattan co-ops of all sizes started to rise even in the last quarter of 2001, compared with statistics from the same period a year before, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. The price per room for three-bedroom apartments even set a record, $266,875, up by 15 percent from the year before. 
Several Manhattan residential real estate brokers, in reports issued this week, also trumpeted what they called a turnaround. 
Paul Purcell, president of Insignia Douglas Elliman, the city's largest real estate brokerage firm, reported that dollar volume, or total sales, in the first two months of 2002 was 42 percent higher than in January and February 2001. One example of today's prices: a one-bedroom at 170 Second Avenue, at 12th Street, sold for $297,000 in 1999; the same apartment recently resold for $425,000, Mr. Purcell said.
Jonathan J. Miller, president of Miller Samuel, one of the city's largest appraisal companies, is more conservative. While other brokers boast of their current sales, Mr. Miller said quietly that the news is good. "I would have imagined that with the negativity on Wall Street and with 9/11 that the real estate market would have suffered," he said yesterday. "Instead, there has been a noticeable uptick in activity."
He also reported modest price increases. The number of Manhattan sales was up by 8.1 percent in February compared with February of last year; prices are up 1 to 2 percent from last month, Miller Samuel reported.
New York's last recession, in the early 1990's, hit real estate hard. Co-op and condo owners who bought at the peak of the market in the late 1980's saw their homes' values plummet. This trend took several years to turn around, partly because real estate takes a long time to sell, as opposed to stocks and other assets.
The bright side of that real estate recession, of course, was that apartments suddenly became affordable for many. Two months ago, Manhattan brokers were making the same argument, and saying that the lull after Sept. 11 offered buying opportunities at lower prices.
Today's vibrant market has surprised most brokers, who privately had been gearing up for a significant real estate recession since January 2001. The Corcoran Group reported that sales contracts signed in February totaled $374 million this year, compared with $176 million last February, said Pamela Liebman, the agency's chief executive. Other agencies said they were running ahead of all predictions. 
Statisticians say the lower end of the market -- studios and one-bedroom co-ops -- was the first to recover, as bargain hunters in need of space found that it appeared to be less expensive to buy than to rent. Although rental prices fell sharply since Sept. 11, they remain high when compared with the cost of buying at the current low interest rates. 
Frederick W. Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg Real Estate, an upper-end firm, said that his business did not pick up as quickly as some other firms, because he trades largely in the more expensive apartments. But things have changed in the past two months, he said. Now, Mr. Peters said, business at Ashforth Warburg is up. The first two and a half months of this year, the company had 69 deals, totaling $112 million. For the same period of 2001, there were 58 deals, for $110 million. 
Bob Siegel, the owner of Ghent Realty Services, said this week that he is moving up plans to develop 15 stories of high-priced condominiums and town houses in the heart of TriBeCa. "Like everyone else in New York City, we adopted a wait-and-see attitude," the developer said.
Around the first of this year, Mr. Siegel put his foot in the water; the signs were good, and he started to make plans for groundbreaking by September. Last week, his research showed that prices of highly finished TriBeCa lofts had regained much of their pre-Sept. 11 value. "When I heard that, I decided to start really cracking the whip and get it started by June," Mr. Siegel said. 
Last fall, articles were written about New Yorkers' flight to far-flung counties along the Hudson River, and to enclaves in Connecticut.
Tom Swope, a real estate agent in Claverack, N.Y., was asked if the masses had reached Columbia County. "Not yet," he said. "We're still waiting."

HEADLINE: Africans Fill Churches That Celebrate Wealth 

BYLINE:  By NORIMITSU ONISHI 

DATELINE: OTTA, Nigeria 

 BODY:
It was just another Sunday morning in the new home of one of Africa's fastest-growing churches, the Winners' Church, which is only a dozen years old but already has branches in 32 countries on the continent.
 Nearly 50,000 faithful had entered the gates of its three-year-old headquarters, perhaps Africa's showiest symbol of the growing influence of America's religious culture of giant churches and lucre-minded television preachers. Called Canaan Land, it is a 565-acre walled campus with a hotel, gas station, bank, restaurants, shops, the foundation of a university and the continent's largest church auditorium. 
 Inside, half a dozen members gave testimonies that warmed up the crowd before the pastor's sermon. Soon after joining Winners, a man said, he had won a $12,000 contract. A computer salesman named Peter cannot sell his products fast enough now. James, his prayers answered at long last, testified that a new job had flushed the anxiety from his heart. 
"I had a rest, the kind of rest you have if you have a big account somewhere," James said as the crowd in Canaan Land laughed appreciatively.
Christianity is growing faster in sub-Saharan Africa than in any other place on earth. Roman Catholicism and the major Protestant denominations are gaining more followers every day, but new churches like Winners are leading the boom. 
They are Pentecostal churches, often led by men influenced by American evangelists in the South and Midwest who preach a similar message that success comes to those who pray. On Sundays in nearly every African city these are the churches drawing the biggest crowds, especially among the youth.
But many traditional religious leaders and ordinary Nigerians say the new churches are less concerned with saving souls than with making money. 
"The quickest and easiest way to make money in Nigeria is to carry a Bible on Sunday and start preaching," said the 66-year-old Roman Catholic archbishop of Lagos, Anthony O. Okogie. 
The boom in Pentecostal churches began in the last decade, a particularly troubled period in Africa, which had lost its economic and ideological moorings after the end of the cold war. Nigeria, adrift more than most, populated by one in six Africans, has had the biggest religious explosion. According to the Pentecostal Fellowship Movement of Nigeria, 50 Pentecostal ministries had registered with it in 1990; today, the number is 250.
These days, every other billboard on the highways of Lagos and every other hand-painted sign in its neighborhoods seem to point to a new church. If South Africa is the leading exporter of business to the rest of the continent, Nigeria may be its leading exporter of religion. Its churches are gaining footholds across the continent and even in Europe and the United States.
"It will be our main exports to the world, our assets of highest value," said the Rev. David Oyedepo, 47, who in 1989 founded the Winners' Church in Lagos, a two-hour drive south of here. He moved to Otta three years ago and recently bought 2,000 additional acres of land nearby, the phenomenal growth fueled by the simplicity of his message. "Prosperity is acknowledged worldwide as the identity of our ministry," Mr. Oyedepo writes in a pamphlet for new members. "God prospers people here. He will prosper you too!"
In a country where nearly a third of the 120 million people live on under a $1 a day and 40 percent are illiterate, according to the World Bank, the message resonates. Nigeria's two million barrels of oil a day have produced only deepening poverty for the ordinary Nigerian. But in the Pentecostal churches, members buy what is called Prosperity Theology. Wealth is celebrated.
Consider the Rev. Chris Okotie, 43, a pop singer who turned preacher after studying at a Bible college in Tulsa, Okla. He founded the Household of God church in his house in 1987. With a ballooning congregation, he moved it into a warehouse in 1993. He then bought all the other warehouses on the block, a total of 20 acres with, among other things, a 1,500-car parking lot and a six-story school under construction.
After leading a visitor around his street and walking by his new black Mercedes-Benz, Mr. Okotie said, without any prodding, "Maybe we should take a picture by this car." Dressed all in black, in a tight T-shirt, jeans and sneakers, he posed by crossing his arms and leaning against the hood of the car, which came equipped with two small television screens. Several bodyguards, also in black and wearing combat boots, followed him around, barking commands into walkie-talkies.
In his office, a mirror covered a wall, a closed-circuit security television sat on his desk, a guitar and a photograph of Muhammad Ali lay on the floor. Mr. Okotie said the drums, electric guitars and dancing at Pentecostal churches allowed for a closer connection with God by focusing on the outpouring of emotions. "It's like being at a party," he said. 
Mr. Okotie's empire extends on a block formerly named after the National Bank. After independence in 1960, the bank provided loans to most Nigerian businessmen in this region to develop an industrial base, but it later collapsed. Today this is called the Household of God Street.
But Mr. Okotie is hardly alone. Many new churches seeking space in Lagos large enough for their booming congregations have converted warehouses into church auditoriums.
"The warehouses were all empty because of the decline in manufacturing," said Rasheed Adegbenro, director of corporate affairs for the Manufacturers' Association of Nigeria. "Then the churches came along. Now you won't find any machines in those warehouses, only worshipers."
Some, too big even for the warehouses, have bought land on the highway from Lagos to Ibadan, now known as church highway. Still others have found undeveloped land in places like Otta.
On a recent Sunday, the highway to Otta was crowded with dozens of white school buses the Winners' Church had sent to pick up members in Lagos. At a tollgate near here, hawkers sold 15-cent white handkerchiefs that members wave during services and one-cent white envelopes for making donations. 
Mr. Oyedepo delivered an hourlong sermon on faith, obedience and sacrifice. Members started taking notes, a common practice in Pentecostal churches. He asked for 100,000 donations of $35 each month toward completing a university.
The service ended. As Mr. Oyedepo left the auditorium, about a dozen bodyguards walked closely around him, and ushered him into a Toyota Land Cruiser with tinted windows for the short drive to his office. 
Steve Akadiri, 37, a reporter for Nigeria's public radio, was one of thousands streaming out of the auditorium. Raised an Anglican, he said he had joined the Winners' Church in 1995. When members were called to donate money in 1999 toward the construction of Canaan Land, Mr. Akadiri said he sold his old Volkswagen Beetle and donated the $175.
"Six months later, some business came my way and I was able to buy a better car," he said.
In his office the next morning, Mr. Oyedepo said he had modeled himself on the Rev. Kenneth Hagin of Tulsa, Okla. Most Pentecostal preachers either studied in the United States or learned from men who had, he said. He waved away the possibility that any social and economic reasons might lie behind the boom in Pentecostal churches, saying only, "It's a divine time."
The Pentecostal churches, their critics say, willfully ignore Africa's problems, especially if they entail confronting corrupt regimes. In Nigeria, ruled by brutal generals for most of its independent history, Pentecostal ministers have never challenged the military rulers, as Catholic priests have.
At the Catholic archdiocese in Lagos, civil servants and market women attended Mass on a recent morning. In the Yoruba language, Archbishop Okogie, who has held his post for more than a quarter of a century, talked of the wisdom of Solomon.
After communion, he led a "Prayer for Nigeria in Distress." Written during the depth of military rule, the prayer has been revived as rising lawlessness has threatened the country's fragile democracy.
"God of infinite goodness, our strength in adversity, our health in weakness, our comfort in sorrow, be merciful to us, your people. Spare this nation, Nigeria, from chaos, anarchy and doom. . . ."
In his small office afterward, the archbishop shook his head at the new churches. "They know people are poor -- they need money," he said. "Why not exploit that need? They are not helping this society at all."
Even some Pentecostal ministers acknowledge abuses in the movement. In Lagos, Mr. Okotie has been engaged in a long-running feud with another minister, accusing him of peddling miracles and healing, though some newspapers have described the feud as mere rivalry.
"There are many charlatans out there who want to turn the work of God into an emporium," he said. "There are many young ministers who want to become millionaires overnight. Others will take a piece of item from you and tell you some miracle will happen. But for you to acquire the miracle, you must give money so that the minister will pray for you."
Nevertheless, the new churches are thriving, so much so that in the industrial area of Ikeja in Lagos it is easier to find a warehouse occupied by a church than by industrial goods.
During the oil boom of the 1970's, factories ran at full capacity and warehouses were stocked with goods, said Mr. Adegbenro of the Manufacturers' Association. Today, factories are operating at a worrisome 35 percent capacity.
On a personal level, however, he is not too worried. In 1996, during a particularly difficult period in his life, he, too, joined a Pentecostal church, the Redeemed Christian Church, one of Nigeria's largest, with branches in Africa and America.
"One night that year, there was a blackout," Mr. Adegbenro said, recalling how he had found his church. "I walked around in the dark and I passed several churches I knew. And eventually I saw a big building, a three-story building I had passed many times but never stopped to look. It was built to house a warehouse. Now it was a church."

PERSON: Edward F. Stancik 

HEADLINE: Edward Stancik, 47, New York Schools Investigator, Dies 

BYLINE:  By ABBY GOODNOUGH 

 BODY:
Edward F. Stancik, who as chief investigator of the New York City school system over the last 12 years gained a reputation as a relentless -- some school officials said overzealous -- pursuer of corruption and misconduct, died yesterday in Manhattan. He was 47.
 The cause was not disclosed. Mr. Stancik, who was under care at New York University Medical Center, had chronic heart problems. 
 During his tenure, Mr. Stancik helped bring about some important systemwide changes, including a state law that diminished the powers of local school boards, several of which he exposed as corrupt. Yet sometimes, cases that he publicized in dramatic news conferences later proved not as outrageous as he had made them out to be.
Until Mr. Stancik was appointed special commissioner of investigation for the city schools in 1990, the board's own investigative division was the only check on corruption in the schools, and was considered too cozy with those it was supposed to keep honest.
In contrast, Mr. Stancik operated independently of the board, rankling a succession of schools chancellors who sometimes accused him of overdramatizing cases to enhance his own reputation. None, however, could force him out, since Mr. Stancik could be removed only by the city's commissioner of investigation, who reports to the mayor. Mr. Stancik's office was created in 1990 as an outgrowth of the Gill Commission, which was appointed during the Koch administration to investigate patronage, politics and corruption in the school system. The commission concluded that the board's investigative arm was "reminiscent of the Keystone Kops," persuading Mayor David N. Dinkins to create the independent investigator's post.
During his 12-year tenure, Mr. Stancik released hundreds of scathing reports that accused everyone from teachers to custodians to community school board members of flouting the law in scandalous fashion. He was especially relentless in uncovering sexual abuse of students, and some education officials complained that his headline-grabbing exposes made the problem seem far more prevalent than it was.
Last year, however, after several sex-abuse complaints against teachers and administrators were widely publicized, Schools Chancellor Harold O. Levy joined Mr. Stancik in pressuring school officials to report cases that, in past years, might not have prompted any action.
In 1992, Mr. Stancik released a report detailing chronic financial abuses by custodians and the failure of the school system to stop them. Some custodians, he said, had created fake jobs for nonexistent assistants and then collected the salaries, and many spent most of their working hours at other jobs or otherwise away from work. The report led to a state law that allowed stricter oversight of custodians.
In 1997, after Mr. Stancik released a stinging report on gangs, Rudy Crew, then the chancellor, bitterly accused Mr. Stancik of producing exaggerated reports that unfairly damaged the reputation of the school system and its employees.
Despite his contempt for Mr. Stancik, Dr. Crew used his investigations of corrupt local school boards to help persuade the State Legislature to strip the boards of much of their hiring and firing powers in 1996. That change was considered one of the most significant in the school system in decades, as it sharply increased the chancellor's powers.
Mr. Stancik's many reports on violence in schools helped bolster Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's argument that the Division of Schools Safety, then run by the Board of Education, should be taken over by the city Police Department. The board agreed to that change in 1998.
Mr. Stancik, who headed a staff of 60, had the power to subpoena, take testimony under oath and arrest, but not to prosecute. If he found evidence of criminal action, he turned it over to the appropriate district attorney for prosecution. Of 196 criminal arrests by Mr. Stancik's office since it was created, 132 have led to guilty pleas and 8 to convictions. Twenty-three cases are pending.
Some of his investigations did not live up to their promise. In 1999, he accused 52 teachers, principals and other educators of helping students ratchet up scores on standardized tests in what was described as one of the biggest cheating scandals in American public schools. But a year later, roughly half of those accused had been reinstated, either because the evidence was insufficient or such punishment was deemed unwarranted. 
Edward Francis Stancik was born on Dec. 2, 1954, in Chicago, and grew up in a suburb. He was an only child, whose mother died when he was 14. His father, a printer, helped put him through the University of Illinois, where he majored in economics. He went on to Columbia Law School, where he was managing editor of the law review 
After graduating from law school in 1979, he worked for the Manhattan district attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, for 11 years. He rose to deputy chief of the rackets bureau, earning a reputation as a discerning administrator and a skillful trial lawyer.
Mr. Stancik, who lived in TriBeCa, underwent open-heart surgery in 1995 and again in 1997, to replace damaged heart valves. Although he was intensely private about his health problems, his increasingly gaunt appearance made it clear that they continued to plague him.
Mr. Stancik, who is survived by his father, Edward, and stepmother, Therese, often said that his outsider status was the best tool for illuminating and ending corruption that might otherwise be overlooked or even tolerated within the clannish school system. "There is a sort of culture at the Board of Education that is difficult to pierce," he said in an interview. "When trouble develops, the attitude should be 'Let's get to the bottom of this.' At the Board of Education, the attitude often is 'Let's get our friends out of this.' "

Mets Delay New Lease, Citing Poor Attendance

BYLINE:  By RAFAEL HERMOSO 

DATELINE: HAINES CITY, Fla., March 12 

 BODY:
Fred Wilpon has one request to keep the Mets in Port St. Lucie, Fla.
 "I'd like to see more people show up to the stadium," Wilpon, the Mets' co-owner, said this week. "Every place we go, we draw a full house. I was in Jupiter yesterday and there were 8,000 people there. Here we can't draw 4,000 people. It's discouraging." 
 Attendance, or its decline, has led the Mets to delay extending their lease for Thomas J. White Stadium beyond this year. This is the Mets' 15th year at the complex after spending 26 years in St. Petersburg, Fla. Although the team is delighted with the improvements made several years ago and loves the convenience of the seven centrally located fields, it is concerned about the bottom line.
After the Mets raised their payroll this season to more than $100 million, attendance has declined in Port St. Lucie, even as advance ticket sales for games at Shea Stadium have increased by 10 percent from this point last year.
St. Lucie County is concerned the Mets are biding their time here, waiting for a sweeter deal. Club executives have spoken with officials from West Palm Beach, Fla., about a new complex -- the Braves and the Expos left after 1997 -- but West Palm Beach has no plans to finance a stadium, and even Wilpon calls a possible move there a dead issue.
Mets officials expect to return to Port St. Lucie, but they are not sure for how long. The Mets' 15-year lease expires next February, and they have 180 days before then to exercise a five-year option. Another five-year option is available after that. 
Port St. Lucie is a growing community of nearly 100,000 people, and the Mets' presence adds more than $20 million to the local economy, said Dave Howard, the Mets' senior vice president for business and legal affairs. 
"You have to market the team," Wilpon said. "We've put a lot of money into the team, and it's a very attractive team in New York. It should be attractive here, too."
Doug Anderson, the St. Lucie County administrator, said the sides were working on a joint marketing plan, but he added that increased attendance was almost inevitable. 
"We feel by this being one of the fastest-growing counties in the country, the situation will take care of itself," he said.
The Mets have averaged 4,108 fans in their first seven home dates (they are drawing 6,550 on the road). If that figure holds, it would be the third straight spring that attendance has dropped. The Mets averaged 4,715 at home last year and 4,735 in 2000. The Mets keep all but 15 percent of the gate receipts from games; the rest goes to the county.
At a meeting with the Mets on Monday, Anderson proposed another 15-year lease that included significant stadium improvements.
The five-year option does not qualify as long-term, Anderson said, and the county is not interested in anything shorter. Anderson offered to build a picnic area where bleachers stand along the right-field line as part of the five-year option. "The longer the contract, the more the county will invest in capital improvements," he said.
The Mets on Monday asked for architectural drawings on the facility, Howard said, "assuming we stay there long-term, five years or longer. We have some space needs, as far as the clubhouse and office."
Anderson said Port St. Lucie had poured $1.5 million into the complex since the fall of 1997.
A lack of alternatives may keep the sides together. The county has invited the Cleveland Indians, who train in Winter Haven, Fla., to tour the Mets' facility. Howard said the Indians were more interested in moving to Florida's West Coast.
Wilpon and Howard said the Mets had not explored other Florida sites but were aware several might become available.
The Royals are leaving Baseball City Stadium and the Rangers will leave Port Charlotte after this season to head to Arizona. The Mets could use either as leverage in negotiations, although neither complex is as attractive as Port St. Lucie. Jupiter's four-year-old, two-team complex could become available if the Expos are eliminated, but the Florida Marlins owner, Jeffrey Loria, who took along most of his front-office and management staff from Montreal, is expected to move the Marlins there from Viera. That would leave Space Coast Stadium vacant, but that complex is even more remote than Port St. Lucie, with whipping winds and a sun glare into home plate.
Meanwhile, the Mets and Port St. Lucie may live on. "Our facility is a state-of-the-art facility," Anderson said. "The fields are top notch. It's an excellent spring training facility. I think it's going to be difficult for them to find another spring training facility as nice as ours and where people are as accommodating as we are."

INSIDE PITCH
MIKE PIAZZA was hit on the bottom of his left hand by a pitch from Kansas City's JEFF SUPPAN, the second time he has been hit by a pitch in eight days, but he remained in the game. . . . ROGER CEDENO hyperextended and cut his left pinkie sliding into home plate Sunday. He did not play Monday but led off Tuesday, going 1 for 3. . . . JOHN FRANCO (elbow) plans to throw off a mound Wednesday for the first time since Feb. 25. . . . JAE WEONG SEO allowed nine runs, six earned, in two and a third innings and DICKY GONZALEZ surrendered five runs in two and a third innings in a 15-8 loss to the Royals.

HEADLINE: BOXING; 
Tyson Wins License to Fight Lewis in Washington

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12 

 BODY:
The boxing commission here decided unanimously tonight to grant Mike Tyson a license to fight Lennox Lewis in June in what could be the most lucrative bout in history.
 The three members of the District of Columbia Boxing and Wrestling Commission voted after its monthly public hearing to give Tyson, boxing's most controversial contender, a license to fight for Lewis's two heavyweight titles. 
 The vote was the critical step toward bringing the fight to the 20,600-seat MCI Center on June 8, the bout's working date.
"I'm thrilled to be licensed in Washington, D.C.," Tyson said in a statement. "I applaud the decision and will give fight fans in the district what they deserve, the chance to see me knock out Lennox Lewis in June." 
The commissioners said they had made their decision after an exhaustive review of Tyson's application and after having met with Tyson last week. Neither Tyson nor Lewis was at the hearing tonight.
"We deliberated so hard on trying to be official as possible," said Michael Brown, vice chairman of the commission. "It would be frivolous for us to stand up here and not be concerned about Mr. Tyson's past, but our job was to look at the application to box."
The ruling came after the commission listened to almost two hours of impassioned public testimony, in which residents -- from lawyers to business owners to high school students -- urged the commission to allow the fight. More than 200 people squeezed into the room and dozens stepped to the microphone to talk of black pride, civic pride and economic pride.
"We are a group of women who are in full support of Mr. Tyson bringing revenue into the District of Columbia," said Wanda Bruce, from a group called Women in Support of Tyson. "We feel we should not be the judge or the jury."
After the last speaker, the commission came to a decision quickly, taking only 15 minutes to deliberate.
Although no one inside the room spoke against Tyson, a half-dozen protesters showed up outside the building at 6:30 p.m., when the meeting began. They waved placards with slogans like "Rapists Are Not Role Models." Tyson was convicted of rape in 1992.
The bout, to be televised on HBO or Showtime or both, is expected to generate the most revenue in boxing history, up to $150 million. 
The fighters would reportedly get $17.5 million each, and some people estimate that the bout would inject $10 million into the local economy. Washington's tourist industry has fallen into a slump that began slowly in 1999 and accelerated after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.
The hearing today came after almost two months in which Tyson went from state to state desperately seeking a license, only to have the door slammed in his face like a failed vacuum-cleaner salesman. In late January, the Nevada State Athletic Commission voted by 4 to 1 to reject Tyson's application.
Tyson then applied in a handful of other states, only to have officials in Texas, Colorado and Georgia tell him that he was not welcome.
Washington, though, had more or less rolled out the welcome mat. The mayor, Anthony Williams, said there would be "a very positive impact" if the city licensed the fight. Many of the city's boxing fans clamored to have the fight brought here, although some women's groups objected. The last heavyweight title fight in Washington took place in 1993, between Riddick Bowe and Jesse Ferguson at R.F.K. Stadium.
The conflicting opinions put the boxing commission under pressure. Exactly a week ago, the commissioners met privately with Tyson, one of his lawyers and a doctor who had examined him. Then on Thursday, fight organizers representing Lewis, who holds the World Boxing Council and International Boxing Federation titles, met with the commissioners.
The I.B.F. had given Tyson and Lewis a deadline of March 25 to organize the bout, after which its No. 1 heavyweight contender, Chris Byrd, would presumably get a shot at putting together a fight with Lewis. Tyson is the W.B.C.'s top heavyweight contender.
Tyson's manager, Shelly Finkel, had been trying to keep his site options open. Tyson applied in California, with the Staples Center in Los Angeles being the most likely site in that state.
Memphis and Detroit were also tossed around as sites. Venues in both of those cities expressed a willingness to pay a fee close to the $14 million that the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas had offered. In late January, Tommy Hearns Entertainment, based in Detroit, faxed an application to the Michigan State Athletic Board of Control.
Hearns promoted a bout in Detroit between Tyson and Andrew Golota in October 2000. Commissioners in Michigan have tight restrictions on their power to prevent fights from taking place. A license could be denied there only under specific circumstances, such as if Tyson were under suspension in another state, which he was not.
But Tyson has been punished a number of times for violent behavior both inside and outside the ring. He served three years in an Indiana prison after his 1992 conviction for raping a Miss Black America contestant. Tyson went to prison again, this time for three and a half months, for assaulting two men after a minor traffic accident in Maryland in 1998.
In 1997, the Nevada boxing commission took away Tyson's license for 18 months and fined him $3 million for biting Evander Holyfield's ear during a bout. 
No boxer since Muhammad Ali has generated the controversy that Tyson has. Tyson is regarded by both fans and critics as rage incarnate.
"I'm no Mother Teresa," he told the five Nevada commissioners in January. "I'm not Charles Manson, either."

HEADLINE: Profit at Credit Suisse Group Plunged 73% Last Year 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH OLSON 

DATELINE: ZURICH, March 12 

 BODY:
The Credit Suisse Group today reported a steep 73 percent drop in its 2001 net profit today, and made no promises that earnings would improve this year. The company is concentrating on paring its work force further to revive its fortunes, which have been plagued by missteps at home and at its New York-based investment arm.
 Credit Suisse has had a rough few months. Heavy losses in the fourth quarter, which dragged down the annual results, stemmed from the costs of eliminating 2,500 jobs and from the cost of settling charges that its investment bankers had violated securities regulations in the handling of stock offerings. 
 The bank has also had to deal with embarrassing headlines surrounding an Argentine bank, Banco General de Negocios, which authorities in Argentina say may have transferred some $250 million out of the country illegally for wealthy and influential customers who wanted to evade restrictions on capital flight.
Credit Suisse owns 23 percent of Banco de Negocios, which is run by two influential brothers, Carlos and Jose Rohm.
Credit Suisse's chairman and chief executive, Lukas Muhlemann, and another executive had seats on the Argentine bank's board.
Jose Rohm met with Mr. Muhlemann in Zurich on Jan. 24 at a time when an arrest warrant for Mr. Rohm was outstanding in Argentina. Credit Suisse will not say what they discussed. Immediately after the meeting, Mr. Muhlemann said he would resign from the Banco de Negocios board; the other Credit Suisse executive did the same, as did representatives of J. P. Morgan Chase and Dresdner Bank, which own similar stakes in Banco de Negocios.
Credit Suisse has since written off the whole value of its 30-year-old investment in the Argentine bank.
In an interview today, Mr. Muhlemann stressed that there were no operational links between Credit Suisse and Banco de Negocios and that there were no grounds for concern that Credit Suisse might have been used as a conduit for Argentine money laundering.
But the episode has revived questions about whether Credit Suisse's banking controls are sufficient to spot money from unsavory sources. The bank was chastised by Swiss banking regulators when it became known that the Nigerian dictator Sani Abacha had made large deposits in Credit Suisse accounts, money believed to be part of the $660 million he was accused of looting from his country. 
The Argentine case, which has already cost Credit Suisse $213 million in losses, has prompted Swiss banking regulators to request a detailed report on Credit Suisse's relationship and dealings with Banco de Negocios and its other Latin American financial activities.
"It's not an inquiry," said Tanja Kocher, a spokeswoman for the Swiss Banking Commission. "It's a question of reputation of a Swiss bank and the Swiss financial center. When a bank is involved in a matter that makes such a noise, then we have to ask for explanations."
Credit Suisse's investment banking arm, Credit Suisse First Boston, has been in turmoil for months, as it searches for ways to get its payroll under control, both in head count and in dollar terms, and to revamp its business model. Today, the chairman of the unit, John J. Mack, predicted that it would exceed its target of saving $700 million through job cuts, but he added that it would take two to three years to get salary and bonus levels down to the industry average.
Besides the settlement with American regulators, which cost the company $100 million in January, Credit Suisse First Boston has been buffeted by reports that it was involved in complex partnerships and financial dealings with the Enron Corporation. Credit Suisse denied that it had done anything improper and said the deals it took part in were "audited and approved by rating agencies, external legal counsel and external auditors." Enron's bankruptcy led to a $126 million write-off for Credit Suisse last year.
Given the problems besieging the company, investors have questioned whether Mr. Muhlemann should continue to be both the chief executive and the chairman, a concentration of responsibility other large Swiss companies are moving away from. Mr. Muhlemann brushed off such questions today and said he was not prepared to relinquish either post.
The company said on Friday that Mr. Muhlemann had taken no part in decisions by the bank's team that advised Swissair. Mr. Muhlemann was a director of the airline when it undertook an expansion strategy that later backfired and plunged it into bankruptcy. He testified last week before a Swiss parliamentary committee about the bank's role.
The airline's collapse dented the reputation of Mr. Muhlemann, 51, once a leading star on the Swiss business scene. And it threw a harsh spotlight on the close ties among many Swiss executives, who often serve on one another's boards. 
With several major Swiss companies now floundering financially, the wisdom of drawing so exclusively from such a small, overlapping management pool has been questioned openly, and Mr. Muhlemann has been at the center of that debate. He has been obliged in recent days to resign another board post, the deputy chairmanship of Swiss Re, the insurance company.

PERSON: Dr. James Tobin 

HEADLINE: James Tobin, Nobel Laureate in Economics and an Adviser to Kennedy, Is Dead at 84 

BYLINE:  By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE 

 BODY:
Dr. James Tobin, a professor emeritus of economics at Yale who was a top adviser in the Kennedy administration and received the Nobel Prize in economics in 1981, died on Monday in New Haven. He was 84 and lived in New Haven.
 The cause was a stroke, a Yale spokeswoman, Dorie Baker, said. 
 Dr. Tobin was known for applying economic theory to the way people made decisions and for advocating the Keynesian theory of government intervention in the economy. Throughout his career, he battled conservative economists like Milton Friedman, a Nobel laureate at the University of Chicago, who disdained government intervention. Dr. Tobin regarded his Nobel Prize as a vote of confidence in the Keynesian theory. 
Paul A. Samuelson, a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called Dr. Tobin "the leading macroeconomist of our generation."
A macroeconomist studies the way an economic system performs, with particular attention to the vagaries of budgetary and monetary policies. Dr. Tobin also made significant contributions to the understanding of international financial markets, statistical methods and the study of spending decisions by households and businesses.
The Nobel selection committee called his work a breakthrough in analyzing the relationship of financial markets, including those for stocks and bonds, with "real" markets, like those for real estate, factory machinery and consumer goods. Describing this relationship, the committee said, had been a "classic problem in economic research."
Dr. Tobin concluded that investors were affected by their assessments of how risky their decisions might be and that they differed in the amount of risk they were willing to take. He explored the tendency to build portfolios in which risks were balanced against more secure assets. Earlier analyses frequently oversimplified the behavior, assuming that investors typically sought the highest return without regard to risk.
But Dr. Tobin's work, known as the Portfolio Selection Theory, helped increase the understanding of an investor's willingness to hold various assets. During times of inflation, for instance, he found them less willing to hold stock or cash, turning instead to bonds or physical assets like real estate.
After he won the Nobel Prize, reporters asked him to explain the portfolio theory. When he tried to do so, one journalist interrupted, "Oh, no, please explain it in lay language." So he described the theory of diversification by saying: "You know, don't put your eggs in one basket." Headline writers around the world the next day created some version of "Economist Wins Nobel for Saying, 'Don't Put Eggs in One Basket.' "
Another theory, important to investors as well as to policy makers, was called Tobin's Q. This ratio measures the relationship of the market value of factories or other corporate assets to their replacement cost. When replacement costs run high, Tobin's Q runs low, and in those situations, companies tend to expand by acquiring other companies instead of building plants or buying equipment.
The theory gained prominence at the height of the market boom in the late 1990's, when researchers noted that the overall value of Tobin's Q in the market looked unreasonably high relative to historical norms. Some economists argued that such a discrepancy would be followed by a sharp decline, which soon arrived.
When President John F. Kennedy asked him in 1961 to join the Council of Economic Advisers, Dr. Tobin had spent little time in government and politics, confining himself to teaching and research first at Harvard and, since 1950, at Yale.
"I'm afraid you've got the wrong guy, Mr. President," Dr. Tobin replied. "I'm an ivory tower economist."
"That's the best kind," Mr. Kennedy said. "I'm an ivory tower president."
As things turned out, in the view of his colleagues, Dr. Tobin brought to government the same independence of mind and intellectual rigor that he brought to research. He helped engineer a tax cut, not enacted until after Mr. Kennedy's death, that many politicians have cited as one of the most successful government efforts to revive a halting economy.
James Tobin was born on March 5, 1918, in Champaign, Ill., the son of Louis M. Tobin, a journalist, and Margaret Edgerton Tobin, a social worker. As an undergraduate at Harvard in the 1930's, he was taught economics by Joseph A. Schumpeter, Wassily Leontief, Seymour Harris, Alvin Hansen and other members of a department that has become legendary.
He was attracted to economics because he felt a need to understand the Depression and was intrigued by the economic discussion over what should be done about unemployment and other problems, a classic debate between the hands-off theory of Adam Smith and the intervention theory of John Maynard Keynes.
Dr. Tobin graduated summa cum laude in 1939 and earned his master's degree the next year. After a wartime interruption to serve one year in the federal government and four years in the Navy, he returned to Harvard to earn a Ph.D. in 1947.
In the Navy, he received officer training at Columbia University in the same class with Cyrus R. Vance, who later became secretary of state, and Herman Wouk, who later wrote "The Caine Mutiny."
In that novel, Dr. Tobin was the inspiration for a midshipman named Tobit, described by Mr. Wouk as "ahead of the field by a spacious percentage." The appearance in the novel "was my greatest claim to fame, until today," he joked 40 years later, on the day he won the Nobel Prize.
By that time, Tobit had become the name of a statistical technique Dr. Tobin devised for analyzing data with maximum or minimum values. For instance, Tobit can accurately parse out how factors like age and income influence individual decisions about how much to contribute to individual retirement accounts.
In his undergraduate honors thesis, he found some fault with Keynesian logic, though he generally gave enthusiastic support to its principal doctrine. In his thesis he explored an issue that would intrigue him his entire career: Should the government intervene in a free-market economy and, if so, to what extent?
Dr. Tobin maintained that Keynes had been right in arguing that the economy needed help on occasion in solving problems like severe unemployment and poverty, but that he went further than necessary.
In an interview in 1996, Dr. Tobin described some of his research as an effort to "fix up some of the implausibilities in Keynesian economics and to make more sense of it." He said, "There has been justified criticism of the Keynesian model, that it was too Depression-oriented."
Dr. Tobin also formalized the idea of a tax on international transactions, which he asserted could enhance financial stability and prevent flash currency crises, like those that affected Southeast Asia in the late 1990's. The "Tobin tax" found support among fellow economists including Lawrence H. Summers, before Mr. Summers joined the World Bank and the Treasury Department. After the Asian crisis, many advocates for developing countries revived the proposal.
Dr. Tobin served on the Council of Economic Advisers with Kenneth J. Arrow and Robert M. Solow, who both went on to win Nobel Prizes in economics.
"The Kennedy council was effective," Dr. Tobin said, "because the president and his immediate White House staff took academics seriously."
He served on the council under Mr. Kennedy and for less than a year under President Lyndon B. Johnson, when he returned to Yale. "Fifteen-hour days and seven-day weeks were a hardship for me, my wife and our four young children," he said.
Back at Yale, he studied the economically disadvantaged and the inadequacies and inefficiencies of federal and state welfare programs.
During the 1972 presidential race, Dr. Tobin helped develop for the campaign of Senator George McGovern what was called the negative income tax, a modest income payment to those below the poverty line. But he said Mr. McGovern and his staff botched its presentation in the heat of the California primary and voters thought the proposal was "a kooky budget-breaking handout."
A scaled-down version of such an income transfer to the poor was later enacted into law in the first Bush administration, but it was eliminated by President Bill Clinton.
Dr. Tobin acknowledged that some Great Society ideas of the 60's were too optimistic about what government could accomplish. But he said in a 1996 interview that "many of the benefit programs, like food stamps, are credited by their opponents as well as their supporters with having essentially brought poverty as conservatively defined by the federal government, down close to zero." 
He retired as a faculty member in 1988 at age 70 but continued teaching as professor emeritus.
Dr. Tobin was the author of some 500 articles and 16 books.
He is survived by his wife of 55 years, the former Elizabeth Fay Ringo; a daughter, Margaret Ringo Segall, of New York; three sons, Louis Michael, of Madison, Wis.; Hugh Ringo, of Seattle; and Roger Gill, of Belmont, Mass.; a brother, Roger Gill, of Venice, Fla.; and three grandchildren.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an obituary on March 13 about Dr. James Tobin, who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science, misstated his tenure on the Council of Economic Advisers. He served for two years under President John F. Kennedy but did not remain under President Lyndon B. Johnson.
Because of an editing error, an obituary on March 13 about James Tobin, who received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science in 1981, misstated the fate of an income-transfer program for the poor that he helped to develop. A scaled-down version was enacted in 1975 and expanded in 1990 and 1993. It was not eliminated by the Clinton administration.

HEADLINE: Though France Booms, Voters Find Politics Blah 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE DALEY 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 12 

 BODY:
France has undergone a remarkable economic and social transformation in the last few years, and Francois Prioux, 26, exhibits this country's newfound confidence.
 Three years ago, he secured the financing for his new company, Firstinvest, based in the Sentier quarter of Paris, where dozens of Web firms were transforming the sweatshops of a fading garment district into France's version of Silicon Valley. 
 Since then, many start-up companies have fallen on hard times, but Mr. Prioux is unbowed. "We are still very enthusiastic," he said. "Last year was very bad, particularly after Sept. 11. But right now we have more orders than we have ever had." 
Yet for all the economic renewal under way, the country's political scene remains largely unchanged. This year's presidential election is shaping up to be a rerun of the 1995 race, with the conservative president, Jacques Chirac, now 69, once again facing off against his longtime rival, the Socialist prime minister, Lionel Jospin, 64.
The rematch has left most French voters cold. Opinion polls indicate that a vast majority want new faces in the race. They also suggest that the abstention rate this year may be higher than ever before. Ask Mr. Prioux whom he will vote for and he rolls his eyes.
"My friends and I hardly even talk about politics," he said. "We really aren't inspired."
In this election year, such frustration can be heard across the country, where new is in and the old is, at the very least, being questioned.
Economically the country looks quite different these days. The double-digit unemployment figures and the vast array of state-owned companies are gone. As the 20th century came to a close, France -- famously state-heavy, overtaxed and tradition-bound -- had the fastest-growing economy in Europe.
But change goes beyond that. The country has also cut its work week to 35 hours, guaranteed women parity in party nominations for most offices and even created a newfangled type of marriage that can be dissolved on three months' notice.
Always smug about the superiority of its language and its education system, France has nevertheless begun overhauling its curriculums and questioning the fairness of its most elite schools. New admission policies have been put in place to help the disadvantaged, and more foreign language and work-abroad requirements have been introduced.
Even France's culinary habits are evolving. Long lunches are out. Takeout is in. Wine consumption is plummeting.
In this atmosphere a race between Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin, who have been at the center of Frances political life for more than two decades, looks out of step.
Few people see much difference between the two candidates, who are in a tight race. 
Though Mr. Chirac is labeled center-right, some political analysts point out that if he went to America he would stand far to the left of Al Gore. For instance, Mr. Chirac does not talk of eliminating the Socialist policy of a 35-hour work week, only of adapting it. Nor does he talk of dismantling France's generous social safety net.
In one recent survey by the Louis Harris Institute, 74 percent of those questioned said they saw hardly any difference between Mr. Chirac and Mr. Jospin. Fifty-nine percent said they had little or no interest in the race.
The first round of the election is scheduled for April 21, to be followed by a runoff on May 5.
"From a sports point of view this race is quite interesting, because we have no idea who will win," said Alain Minc, an economist and author. "But from a political point of view the contest is quite meaningless. Nothing much new is going to happen no matter who wins."
Today, Mr. Minc and others say, the French feel that their darkest days are over. Earlier this month, French officials had to revise economic growth forecasts for this year downward.
But even so, they were quick to point out that France was still expected to do better than most of its neighbors and allies -- three times as well as Germany, twice as well as the United States and one and a half times as well as the Euro zone average.
From the mid-1980's to the mid-90's, France's economy was virtually stalled. The country was still rich. It remained the fourth-biggest industrial power and the fourth-largest exporter. But unemployment swelled to more than 12 percent, and there was a pervasive sense that power, wealth and even ideas might be drifting out of its reach.
No longer. Nearly five years of solid growth -- and victory in a World Cup championship -- have gone a long way toward restoring France's sense of self-confidence. By any measure, France is a world leader in transportation, aerospace, civil engineering and telecommunications and wireless technology.
Since 1997, $24 billion worth of state-owned enterprises, including giants like Air France, Thomson Multimedia and France Telecom, have been privatized.
Just how far reform will go is uncertain. France still has one of Europe's highest tax burdens -- 45.2 percent of gross domestic product -- and one of its most bloated public sectors, accounting for one out of every four jobs. 
Polls show more and more support for a weaker government and a more market-driven economy. But the French still dismiss candidates who talk too much market economy. They want the state to provide social justice and protect social security benefits, and they are willing to pay for it.
A recent poll put a growing disparity in wealth near the top of French concerns. More than 65 percent said they were worried about social inequality. Concern about a drop in buying power was mentioned by only 51 percent.
"We continue to dream of a Kennedyesque-Johnson society," said Louis Chauvel, a sociologist at the prestigious Institut d'Etudes Politiques. "The state must protect the weaker members of society. That is a principle that can not be touched in the minds of the French."
Still, the pull to government jobs, once seen here as the noblest of callings, is faltering. Ten years ago only one out of 200 graduates of France's elite universities expressed interest in becoming an entrepreneur. Today more than half do. 
Applications to the French school dedicated to shaping the country's top students for a life in government, the National School of Administration, are on the decline.
Private schools teaching computer and telecommunications skills, schools that barely existed 10 years ago, are now so full that they are turning away students. Life experience also counts for more these days.
"There is a lot of energy here today," said Philippe Alexandre, a journalist who recently wrote a book on the French minister responsible for reducing the French work week. "France is no longer turned in on itself. Our businesses are investing outside the country. Our young are going to study abroad. The French travel. There is a healthy atmosphere here."
There is plenty of grumbling to be heard. In intellectual circles there is much debate about France's diminishing status in the world. But sociologists studying French attitudes say most French citizens, like many Europeans, are increasingly focused on local issues.
"The French these days are far less interested in being a world power," said Jean-Francois Tchernia, a sociologist who has written on changing French values. "The big international questions interest very few."
Voters are far more likely to be focused on the rising crime rate.
There are also signs of growing social problems in the vast public housing projects that surround most major cities, and the unemployment rate is creeping up again.
The 35-hour work week, instituted by Mr. Jospin's government as a job-generating program, has been a mixed success. It allowed an overhaul of many outdated work rules and created some jobs, but it has been a particular hardship for small businesses, some of which have been able to postpone taking the plunge. 
The government has not yet figured out how to pay for the subsidies it doled out to help shoulder the cost of eliminating four hours from the average work week.
For some small-business owners like Ramon Caeiro, who owns a cafe in the wealthy district known as Passy-Auteuil in western Paris, the policy has been a nightmare.
Restaurants are still in a transition phase, with workers allowed to work 39 hours a week, down from 42. Mr. Caeiro says the policy is only prompting his employees to take extra jobs on the side, most of them for cash under the table.
To make ends meet, Mr. Caeiro, like many owners who are not on salary, works in the kitchen himself. "But my customers don't want my cooking -- they want the chef," he said. "And I would like to get out of here sometimes."
Mr. Caeiro says he may leave his ballot blank as a protest this year. "Where are my choices?" he asks.

HEADLINE: Bush's Proposal on Welfare Draws Fire From Democrats 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12 

 BODY:
The Bush administration's welfare proposal came under sharp criticism today from Democrats in the House and the Senate, who argued that any increase in work requirements for welfare recipients must come with more help for child care.
 Tommy G. Thompson, secretary of health and human services, was greeted with elaborate courtesy as he testified before the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee for the first time since the release of the Bush welfare proposal last month. Lawmakers in both parties said that in contrast to the polarizing welfare fight of 1996, there was no reason why they could not work together to produce a bipartisan bill succeeding the 1996 law, much of which expires this year. 
 But the lines of Democratic objection were quickly apparent. Noting that the Bush plan would substantially raise work requirements for welfare recipients, Senator Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee, asked "how in the world" the administration hoped to reach its "ambitious goals" without dealing with the added demands for child care. 
"No parent should have to spend their workday -- or work night -- worrying that their child may not be in good hands," Mr. Baucus said.
Those concerns were echoed by an influential moderate Republican, Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, who noted that a recent study in her state showed that one of the main reasons poor women were unemployed was a lack of child care.
Mr. Thompson faced similar questions in appearing later before the House committee. Representative Jim McDermott, Democrat of Washington, said: "We haven't got enough money to cover the kids now. How can you justify expanding the work requirement another 10 hours?"
Mr. Thompson agreed that child care was an essential ingredient in any welfare-to-work program, but asserted that there was sufficient money in the administration's plan to meet the need.
The Bush proposal would raise the work requirements of the welfare law in two ways: An adult on welfare would be required to work a 40-hour week, up from the current 30 hours, although as much as 16 of those 40 hours could be in education and training activities. Moreover, the Bush plan would require the states to have 70 percent of their welfare caseload working by 2007, up from about 30 percent currently.
Despite those higher requirements, the proposal would maintain the current spending levels for welfare. Administration officials argue that because the welfare caseload has dropped by half since the 1996 law went into effect, that should be enough money to do more for the cases that remain, whether it be child care or creating community work programs.
Still, many Democrats asserted that this was a bad time to put new mandates on the states, given their budget problems stemming from the economic downturn. And many, including Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, noted that these new mandates were being presented by Mr. Thompson, who as governor of Wisconsin was a firm advocate of giving states maximum flexibility.
Mr. Thompson maintained that the federal government was setting standards for the states to meet but allowing them considerable leeway in how they met them.
Several Republicans praised the administration for proposing $300 million a year for counseling and other efforts to encourage and support marriage. 
"I ask you not to be defensive about marriage," Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, told Mr. Thompson. "It's a no-brainer."
While the House atmosphere is far less partisan than in 1996, there were nonetheless signs of tension in Ways and Means today.
The committee's chairman, Bill Thomas, Republican of California, opened the hearing by noting that liberal advocacy groups' dire predictions six years ago about what would happen under the welfare law had proved wrong. Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat on the committee, shot back that the administration ought to work directly with Democrats on a bipartisan bill, since "my Republican friends" seem more interested in campaign language than in seeking consensus.

HEADLINE: OPERA REVIEW; 
Comprehensible Mozart With an Economy of Means

BYLINE:  By BERNARD HOLLAND

 BODY:
When the New York City Opera offers the standard repertory, it is in the form of a service: clear, coherent productions sung by fresh, healthy voices. No epiphanies are promised, and few are delivered. What remains are products like the company's new "Don Giovanni," which opened on Sunday afternoon. 
 The presentation is honest, the sets simple yet workable and substantial. The costumes follow tradition and are pleasing to the eye. Thor Steingraber's direction moves players with modest geometric skill and minimizes melodramatic gesture. The orchestra playing under George Manahan was carefully correct and sometimes more. Anyone needing to know what a Mozart opera has to say and show could do worse than this new "Don." 
 Riccardo Hernandez has created a street facade that narrows as it retreats from the front of the stage. New walls, trees or windows descend in the form of panels from above, moving the opera indoors or out. David C. Woolard's costumes and Christine A. Binder's lighting combine in a kind of dark glow. There is an intelligent economy of means at work, and a consistency that the cast of singers never quite matched.
Mozart's women tended the fire at Sunday's performance. The Donnas Anna and Elvira offered both heat and light, with Alexandrina Pendatchanska having perhaps the richer soprano of the two, but Amy Burton's Elvira was her equal in intensity and musical clarity. Men were in general the weaker sex here. Raul Hernandez's Don Ottavio is sweet voiced and well intentioned but too frail for the part. Interestingly, "Il mio tesoro," the sternest test in a very difficult tenor role, went better than anything that came before.
This "Don" was most fallible at its center. Peter Coleman-Wright in the title role was not a tidy musician, and an opera dependent on ensemble work suffered accordingly. Tempos were rushed, accents lagged behind or were anticipated, detail mauled. Singers around Mr. Coleman-Wright sang crisply and together but often went unnoticed by him. A persistent hint of sharpness did not help matters.
The other men -- Nathan Berg as Leporello, Kevin Burdette as Masetto and Daniel Borowski as the Commendatore -- were all sound professionals, leaving Mariateresa Magisano's pale-sounding Zerlina to suffer by comparison.
Don't be put off by the weaknesses. Mozart whole is the important attraction here, and this "Don Giovanni" is worth a visit. The next performance is tomorrow.

DON GIOVANNI

Opera in two acts by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte; conductor, George Manahan; sets by Riccardo Hernandez; costumes by David C. Woolard; lighting by Christine A. Binder; choreography by Daniel Pelzig; stage director, Thor Steingraber. At the New York City Opera.

HEADLINE: MAKING BOOKS; 
Striving for a Happy Ending To a Black Store's Struggles

BYLINE:  By MARTIN ARNOLD

 BODY:
There can be a fierceness about maintaining an independent bookstore in an African-American community that perhaps cannot be imagined elsewhere, where independent stores fail amid some fuss and publicity and are quickly forgotten because there are stimulating alternatives. 
 But it's different in a black community. The black bookstore has a resonance greater than simply the sale of books. It is often the central, if not the only, cultural hangout in the neighborhood, and its closing leaves a dreadful emptiness, a marker that nobody cares. 
 The Rev. Dr. Charles G. Adams, a nationally prominent African-American clergyman in Detroit, put it this way: "Closing a bookstore is tied to our lack of educational opportunity, lack of intellectual resources that develop our minds. Our schools are understaffed and our libraries operate on very short hours, and bookstores are nonexistent." 
One of the recent epiphanies of book publishing is that there is an increasing black readership that is hungry for books relevant to it. To help feed that need there are now five imprints at major publishing houses devoted to books by African-Americans and about them. But black bookstores, like other independent booksellers, have been assaulted by the big chain stores and online book buying and other venues and, of course, the economy.
When a Shakespeare & Company or a Books & Company closes in Manhattan there is the usual outcry against the chains, and then the stone sinks, the water smooths and what's gone is submerged because the neighborhood generally has other cultural lures. In an African-American neighborhood, like the one in Detroit served by the Apple Book Center, each bookstore is a place of special possibilities, and its closing an elegy to hope.
Financial troubles have the Apple Book Center on the brink of disappearing, and since this was revealed last week in The Detroit News, the store has become the object of a remarkable community effort to save it. Dr. Adams, who is pastor of the Hartford Memorial Baptist Church in Detroit, even proposed that shares of common stock in the store be sold for maybe $10 or $20 each to help settle debts reportedly totaling $300,000.
"The presence of a bookstore in the heart of an underserved city that is 80 percent black is a symbol of upward possibility, and we have to keep the symbol in place so people do not become discouraged," Dr. Adams said, adding that in many black neighborhoods bookstores "are the source of information and inspiration and understanding, and they help us understand who we are, what we are and what our agenda ought to be."
A community committee has been formed to save the the six-year-old Apple Book Center, and the store has started selling memberships for store discounts: 10 percent discounts for contributions of $20 to $100 and 20 percent discounts for donations of $101 and more.
Sherry McGee, the Apple Book Center owner, said that with the recession "sales were pretty much close to operation cost, and then after Sept. 11 they fell below $300-a-day gross and we didn't have a cushion." She said her fixed costs were $22,000 a month in the 4,000-square-foot store, which stocks about 25,000 titles. 
"We thought Christmas would save us," she said. "But we didn't have a good Christmas, and I just owed everyone." She said that the store was in "a large blue-collar area and there were a lot of layoffs." Then came the Detroit News article on March 4, and "people started to rally around us."
"People called crying," she said. "The council of Baptist pastors said they would help."
Kim Trent, a public relations woman for Representative Carolyn Cheeks Kilpatrick, a Democrat, helped found the committee, because she said "its closing would send a negative message about our community; keeping such local stores open is institution building and community building." When one telephones Thea Todd White, a candidate for the Wayne County Commission, the answering machine message first reminds people to vote for her and then goes on, "Yes, the city of Detroit is stepping up to the plate once again and we will save our book center, the Apple Book Center" and concludes "we will keep it within our community."
Denise Stinson, an African-American literary agent based in Detroit, said: "When the economy is bad it's communities like this that are hit the hardest, and communities like this that need bookstores the most. It's important that the book-selling industry see what's happening to Apple, and now the same community is coming to its rescue."
Generally, amid the competition from chains and the economy, African-American bookstores are doing about as well as other independents. Max Rodriguez, publisher of "QBR: the Black Book Review," said, however, that "although the margins for independent bookstores are tight right now, black stores have smaller populations to work with, so it can be harder for them."
Still, Jawanza Kunjufu, founder and owner of African-American Images in Chicago, the largest black bookstore in the country with 27,000 square feet of space and about 60,000 titles, said that the "biggest problem we had after 9/11 was that many authors were afraid to fly and so book signings were seriously curtailed, and the signings sell books."
"But that's been corrected by time," he added.
"A restaurant can improve the quality of the food it serves," he said, "but we can't improve the quality of our product. We've lowered prices, we have a larger selection of African-American titles and a staff more knowledgeable of those titles."
And his store, like many of the smaller black bookstores, has become a community center. The smaller stores support black reading clubs. So does African-American Images, but it's also used for meetings of black professional organizations that have nothing to do with books, like, for instance, travel agents and legal service groups. 
Emma Rodgers, owner of Black Images in Dallas, finds business "challenging, but really kind of O.K." Her store was started 25 years ago as a mail-order business in a flea market, but is now in a shopping mall. "There's a lot of new product out there, not just from the mainstream publishers but from self-publishing and small independent publishers," she said. "We are constantly doing things trying to increase our customer base in the community, which we are very much part of." For instance, she says she has more than 100 reading clubs registered with the store. "Clubs co-host some of our events," she said. "And we post their reading selections, but it's challenging. We used to gross $1 million annually, and now it's $750,000. There's the big stores and the Internet, but we've held on."
Nubian Heritage in Brooklyn has gone a different route. Its owner, Richelieu Dennis, said, "The downtown area here has been very affected by the recession, but people are starting to come back." He has an establishment that's more like an African-American and African department store. "Books are a big portion, but we sell everything that has anything to do with black culture -- art, artifacts, black body products, black financial publications, something for everybody," he said. 
The Apple Book Center is not the only black bookstore in Detroit, and obviously African-American culture does not depend on books alone. But if life is controlled by understanding, then the closing of any bookstore -- where understanding is daily on sale between covers in an object easily held in the hand -- is a sad event. It's a nice story, the community gathering together in Detroit to save the store. All that's needed now is what's always been needed, for customers to step in and buy. Regularly.

PERSON: Sir Raymond Firth 

HEADLINE: Sir Raymond Firth, 100, Expert on Polynesia Life 

BYLINE:  By ERIC NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Sir Raymond Firth, an anthropologist who wrote extensively on the cultures of remote Polynesian islands and was noted for his close attention to scientific evidence, died on Feb. 22 in London. He was 100.
 Sir Raymond began his fieldwork in Polynesia in the 1920's and remained fairly active until his death, making him a force in anthropology for about 80 years. 
 During that period, colleagues said, as competing ideologies rose and fell among anthropologists and schisms cleaved the field, he held fast to the notion that one of the most important things anthropologists could do was begin by simply making careful observations of the world about them.
"Many of us were enthusiasts for some system or other -- Marxism, structuralism, psychoanalysis," Prof. John Davis, a former student of Sir Raymond's at the London School of Economics, wrote two years ago. "The corridors of L.S.E. echoed to the pitter-patter of graduate students bubbling over with excitement at the possibility of applying some newly acquired idea to anthropology. Firth was gently resistant."
Sir Raymond's own background was in economics, and he drew heavily on that field when making his own analysis of cultures like that of the fishermen in Malaya, one of the two areas of study for which he was best known. The other was Tikopia, an atoll in the Solomon Islands that he chronicled extensively in nine books, including the 1963 work "We, the Tikopia."
Born in Auckland, New Zealand, on March 25, 1901, Raymond William Firth traced his interest in Polynesian culture to his birthplace. Early on he studied the Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand. Then in 1924 he enrolled in the London School of Economics, where he came into the orbit of the anthropologist Bronislaw Malinowski. 
Four years later, Dr. Firth made his first visit to Tikopia. At the time, Tikopia was a remote island, seldom visited, of about 1,200 inhabitants, who survived primarily through fishing and agriculture. He returned several times over the next decades.
Sir Raymond was described as one of the first anthropologists to rely heavily on scientific evidence. His writings, praised for their clarity and lack of jargon, were credited with inspiring others outside the field to try their hands at anthropology.
He closely studied the Tikopians' social structures and religious beliefs, as well as the physical surroundings and the way that environment influenced the daily habits of the people.
"He knew, I think, every little stone," said Dr. Sutti Ortiz, a former student of Dr. Firth's who now teaches at the University of Chicago.
Dr. Richard Fardon, chairman of the Association of Social Anthropologists, a British group of which Sir Raymond was life president, credited Sir Raymond with setting a new standard for documentation.
Sir Raymond was knighted in 1973.
His wife, Rosemary, also an anthropologist, died last year. He is survived by a son, Hugh.
Over the years, as theorists came to hold greater sway over anthropology, Sir Raymond's approach -- or at least his detractors' perception of it -- came into some disfavor. "His contemporaries mocked his directness, his failure to abstract and to discover social structure," wrote Professor Davis, the former student, now warden of All Souls College at Oxford.
Supporters argue that Sir Raymond did in fact advance theories but built them from the ground up rather than impose them on the cultures he studied. "He wasn't a mindless empiricist and collector of facts," Dr. Fardon said. "He was a believer that you had better get the facts straight before you can do anything else."

 CORRECTION:
An obituary of the anthropologist Sir Raymond Firth on Thursday misstated the academic affiliation of Dr. Sutti Ortiz, a fellow anthropologist who commented on his thoroughness. She is a professor emerita at Boston University, not the University of Chicago.

HEADLINE: Mugabe's Aides Declare Him Winner of Zimbabwe Vote 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe, March 13 

 BODY:
President Robert Mugabe, the aging African leader who was hailed as a hero until he turned to authoritarianism and violence to strengthen his weakening grip on power, was declared the winner today of a presidential election marred by political violence and other irregularities. 
 The results were swiftly rejected by Mr. Mugabe's challenger, Morgan Tsvangirai, 50, a former union leader, who denounced the voting as rigged. "It's the biggest election fraud I have ever witnessed," he said. 
 Mr. Tsvangirai said the opposition, wary of fueling the political violence that has already claimed the lives of many of its supporters, was considering options that might include a court challenge or calls for a general strike. 
The standoff -- and the possibility of greater civil unrest -- left this already troubled country deeply uneasy. But for today, at least, opposition supporters remained calm, and activity on the streets was dominated by hundreds of young Mugabe backers who showed their approval of the results by dancing and singing. They waved government flags and chanted their support for the president's plan to redistribute farm land from the white minority to blacks.
"More fire!" the young men chanted. "More fire!"
"Our position has been vindicated," the justice minister, Patrick Chinamasa, said in an interview. "We went to the people to seek a new mandate to complete the unfinished business of the liberation war. The people have now given us that mandate." 
Mr. Mugabe, 78, who has run Zimbabwe since white rule ended in 1980, made no statement of his own. 
Before the election he was condemned both here and abroad for apparently condoning the killings of more than 30 people this year, most of them opposition supporters; for banning some opposition rallies, and for reducing the number of polling stations in opposition strongholds. 
But his standing as a hero of one of Africa's liberation struggles, and a general wariness that condemning abuses in Zimbabwe might leave their own governments open to similar scrutiny, helped to mute criticism from other countries. 
In fact, just hours after Mr. Mugabe's tainted victory was announced, the accolades from African states started pouring in. 
South Africa praised the high voter turnout and said the election result "should be considered legitimate." Nigeria said the violent incidents were not "sufficient to threaten the integrity and outcome." The Organization of African Unity hailed the outcome as "transparent, credible, and free and fair."
Those assessments left some Africans here warning that kid-glove treatment of Zimbabwe would raise doubts about the region's commitment to democracy, and they stood in vivid contrast to the judgments of European and American observers, who condemned the vote as fundamentally flawed. 
"We do not recognize the outcome of the election because we think it's flawed, and we are dealing with our friends to figure out how to deal with this flawed election," President Bush said at the White House. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, in unusually blunt criticism, said, "Mr. Mugabe can claim victory, but not democratic legitimacy."
In private, at least, African election observers also condemned the political violence and the government's apparent efforts to disenfranchise opposition supporters through intimidation, changes in election laws and shifts in the distribution of polling stations. 
South Africa and Nigeria are promoting a plan to commit African leaders to democracy and human rights, encouraging Western countries to reward good government with debt relief, investment and aid. 
But there is a strong sense of solidarity with Mr. Mugabe, who nurtured and inspired many leaders here, and a feeling that Africans should maintain a united front, even if that means appearing to close one's eyes to the truth in public. 
"There's this peddling of this 'hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil' in the name of this African brotherhood-sisterhood solidarity," said Duke Lefhoko, a legislator from Bo tswana who led the Southern African Parliamentary Forum. His team of observers was the only African group to sharply criticize the government's handling of the election. 
Mr. Lefhoko said he had no information to support the opposition's claim of rigging. But his group today assailed the political violence that made it difficult for the opposition to campaign, the police officers who refused to investigate political crimes and the apparently calculated reduction of polling stations in opposition strongholds. 
He said some colleagues had tried to press him to water down his report, but he refused. He said Zimbabwe's vote had clearly failed to meet the standards for southern Africa, a region known for relative stability and prosperity. 
"Look, somebody has got to stand up for Africa," Mr. Lefhoko said. "For how long are we going to condone negatives as if they were positives?"
Other African officials say the issue is more complicated. They say it is more effective to work behind closed doors to help resolve Zimbabwe's problems than to embarrass the country publicly. They also say that some human rights officials have exaggerated the extent of the violence and have chosen to ignore the fact that the opposition was also involved in attacks. 
Some African diplomats are also concerned about what they view as efforts by the United States and Britain to determine who should run Zimbabwe. American and British officials have made it clear that they would prefer Mr. Tsvangirai as president.
"The people of Zimbabwe have to determine their destiny," Sam Mo tsuenyane, the head of South Africa's observer mission, said today. "The world must respect that."
According to the government's count, Mr. Mugabe won the election with 56.2 percent of the vote over Mr. Tsvangirai, who garnered 41.9 percent. Of roughly 5.6 million registered voters, about 3 million cast ballots, the government said.
The results indicated that Mr. Mugabe had swept rural communities, where the government had increased the number of polling stations to cull its support among impoverished voters who apparently rallied behind the president's plan to redistribute land of the white minority.
Mr. Tsvangirai, who runs the Movement for Democratic Change, dominated the cities of Harare and Bulawayo, where discontent over soaring prices, unemployment and food shortages simmers. He claimed that there was extensive vote rigging, but proof of that has yet to be established. 
There is no doubt, however, that the government reduced the number of polling places in opposition strongholds. Turnout for the election, which was scheduled for Saturday and Sunday, was high and the numbers simply overwhelmed many polling stations. Many people were forced to wait as long as 10 or 15 hours to vote. 
A high court judge ordered the government to extend the voting through Monday.
The government also refused to accredit several thousand local observers who had applied to monitor the election, leaving hundreds of rural polling stations without enough watchful eyes.
"There was a calculated and insidious disenfranchisement of thousands of people," Mr. Tsvangirai said at a news conference today. "We find ourselves unable to endorse the purported election of President Robert Mugabe."
The opposition and its supporters are also fearful, now that the election is over, that the government might retaliate against them. Since Monday, more than 150 local election observers have been detained and more than 200 opposition party supporters have been arrested and charged with voting twice, officials said. 
On Tuesday, Welshman Ncube, the secretary general of the opposition party, was formally charged with treason in what the police have described as a plot to assassinate Mr. Mugabe. Mr. Tsvangarai has also been charged in the same plot. Both men have denied the charges. 
Amnesty International assailed the roundup as "a pattern of mass arbitrary detention" intended to harass critics of the government. Government officials have described the opposition supporters as criminals intent on destabilizing the country.
Officials at the Crisis in Zimbabwe Committee, a coalition of churches and other civic groups, said they were considering calling for a nationwide strike to channel urban anger over the outcome of the election into peaceful protest. 
"We are concerned about a spontaneous eruption of anger, particularly in urban areas," said Brian Raftopoulos, the chairman of the committee.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE ALLIES; 
Uzbekistan's Leader Doubts Chances for Afghan Peace

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13 

 BODY:
President Islam A. Karimov of Uzbekistan, a pariah-turned-ally in the Bush administration's war on terrorism, wrapped up two days of meetings with top government officials today, praising the American campaign against the Taliban but expressing sharp doubts about the future stability of Afghanistan.
 "Personally, I do not harbor much optimism about future prospects," Mr. Karimov told reporters here this morning. "Of course, peacekeeping operations are very important. But I do not believe that these peacekeepers will interfere into the standoff between warlords and ethnic groups in Afghanistan, and therefore we cannot rule out the possibility of these confrontations." 
 Indeed, Mr. Karimov said, "constant, permanent interethnic strife in Afghanistan," which adjoins his country's southern border, is all but certain to complicate the future. He said the United States "shouldn't lose control of the situation" as it finishes action against the Taliban and Al Qaeda, but said a future American role should be limited to "special operations only."
Only a year ago, Mr. Karimov, a former Soviet-era strongman who has run the country since 1989 and recently extended his current term from five to seven years, was persona non grata in Washington for his country's poor human rights record. In its annual human rights report last week, the State Department harshly criticized the authoritarian regime for torture, beatings and arbitrary arrests of Muslims under the guise of fighting terrorism.
But immediately after Sept. 11, the Bush administration turned to Mr. Karimov for help in staging American military operations from Uzbekistan. On Tuesday, he met President Bush for 45 minutes in the Oval Office and received thanks for that help. Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and the Uzbek foreign minister, Adulaziz Kamilov, signed five cooperation agreements codifying the nations' new strategic relationship.
The most important document commits the United States to "regard with grave concern any external threat" to Uzbekistan while calling for Uzbekistan to "intensify the democratic transformation of its society politically and economically." The United States Export-Import Bank also granted a $55 million credit guarantee, on top of the administration's recent tripling of foreign aid to Uzbekistan to $160 million.
The declaration about external threats refers to remnants of the extremist Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. Mr. Karimov and the United States jointly regard it as a terrorist organization which might regroup outside the country, in Afghanistan, for example. Indeed, Mr. Karimov's concern about such elements may help explain his gloomy comments about the future of Afghanistan and his desire for a continued American presence in Uzbekistan.
"The United States presence in the region is explained by the need to finish the antiterrorist operation," Mr. Karimov, speaking through an interpreter, told reporters at Blair House, the presidential guest residence across from the White House. "The United States may remain in Uzbekistan as long as they think it is necessary; in other words, as long as it takes to finish disrupting the terrorist network."
American commanders have said they do not plan a long-term military presence in Uzbekistan, where the post-Sept. 11 deployment has aggravated Russian concerns about American influence in Central Asia. But Mr. Karimov thanked American parents who "brought up such courageous soldiers," and said the 2,000 American troops in his country were welcome to operate from the air base at Hanabad indefinitely.
A senior administration official said that Mr. Karimov had repeatedly expressed his admiration to Secretary Powell for the United States's swift early success in Afghanistan, where so many nations have come to grief for centuries. At the same time, the official added, "The secretary made it clear that over time, the questions raised about Uzbekistan and the judgments made won't just be about terrorism but about progress on human rights and economic reform."
The official noted that in his private meeting with Secretary Powell, it was Mr. Karimov who brought up the topic of human rights first, acknowledging that he had work to do. In the meeting with reporters this morning, Mr. Karimov also acknowledged, "Yes, indeed, we do have problems with human rights." But he avoided direct answers to questions about specific steps he might be taking to improve conditions.
"We're going to promote democratic development not because we want to get into the good books of the United States, but because it is in our interests," Mr. Karimov said.

HEADLINE: 'Do No Harm' Budgeting 

 BODY:
Yesterday the House Budget Committee began the process of approving a $2.1 trillion federal budget for next year. The surpluses are nearly gone. Gone too are funds needed to shore up Social Security and Medicare in the next decade. Lawmakers are in a tizzy. Some Republicans want more domestic spending cuts to narrow the deficit. Others want to push for still more tax cuts while they have the chance, no matter what that does to the deficit. Democrats are torn between spending more now or saving money for the retirement systems. With control of both the House and Senate up for grabs in November, this is not likely to be a time for much political courage. The best thing we can hope for is a budget that does not make the situation worse. 
 In an ideal world, Congress would find money to finance vital defense and domestic needs and meet minimum health and education obligations by repealing part of the tax cut enacted last year. But President Bush has already said that would happen "over my dead body." In the real world, members of Congress who care about sound budget policy should at least resist passing more tax cuts this year, or accelerating the timetable for future tax reductions. The Bush administration had argued that such an acceleration was necessary because of the economy. That argument is now moot, since the recession -- if there was a recession -- seems to be easing on its own. Plans for more tax cuts should be off the table as well. 
 The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Kent Conrad of North Dakota, is offering a different approach, which has attracted the interest of some Republicans. He wants funds generated by Social Security and Medicare taxes to be set aside and used to pay down debt. Mr. Conrad proposes a "trigger" in the budget, requiring Congress to adopt a five-year plan to wean the government off raiding the Social Security and Medicare trust funds for its regular expenses. The "trigger" may be a gimmick, but if it works in forcing some lawmakers to be responsible, we would welcome it.
Democrats are planning to run for office this fall by accusing Republicans of raiding the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. The theme has a certain familiar ring to it, perhaps because Democrats have been running on and off as defenders of Social Security since at least the 1960's. With the economy improving and Mr. Bush's popularity still very high, the Democrats have no choice but to make Social Security the centerpiece of their campaign to regain control of Congress this year.
The numbers proposed by Mr. Bush -- a huge tax cut, increased spending for defense, education and health and money set aside for Social Security -- did not add up when he was running for president. They did not add up when he proposed his budget last month. They certainly did not add up when the economy was jolted by the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, sending revenues plummeting. And they do not add up today as Congress begins wrestling with the budget.
Mr. Bush has always liked the formulation that the tax cut had to be enacted in order to return the "people's money" to them. But the tax cut has made it impossible to run the people's defense and domestic security systems, provide aid to the people's health programs and still keep the people's retirement systems in sound shape. Even with the economy improving, the stark choices remain.

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL; 
Duke Looks Forward to Not Looking Past Winthrop

BYLINE:  By JACK CURRY 

DATELINE: GREENVILLE, S.C., March 13 

 BODY:
"Duke, You're Next."
 Those words appeared on a poster held by a boisterous fan pictured on Page 4 of the 2001-2 Winthrop University men's basketball media guide. When the picture was taken last season, that challenge was awfully hopeful, and it is oddly prescient now. Winthrop finally has the Blue Devils where it wants them. Sure it does. 
 Duke, the top-seeded team in the South Regional, is expected to demolish 16th-seeded Winthrop when they meet in the first round of the N.C.A.A. tournament on Thursday night at the Bi-Lo Center. The giddy fan with the brash placard does not have to play a vaunted team that is trying to win its second straight national championship. But the Winthrop players, who did not ask for Duke next, have that chore. 
The Eagles (19-11) know what they will encounter: the same kind of skill and talent the Blue Devils (29-3) showed during a spirited 50-minute practice tonight. Whether it was Dahntay Jones soaring above the rim for another windmill dunk, or Jason Williams tossing a sweet ally-oop pass to Carlos Boozer, or Mike Dunleavy draining jumpers that made the net splash, Duke looked ready and imposing.
"I want my guys to have high expectations," Duke Coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "If we fall short, it's because we dreamed to win it all."
Every team in the tournament has dreams of winning, but Winthrop's dreams will probably not last longer than 20 minutes. The last four times the Blue Devils have played a 16th-seeded team, they have won by an average of 36.7 points. Since the N.C.A.A. started seeding teams 17 years ago, 16th-seeded teams are 0-68. Gregg Marshall, the Winthrop coach, admitted that four or five of his players must have their best games ever, while three or four of Duke's players need to have their worst games for the Eagles to have a chance.
"No one can deny we have a chance," Marshall said. "It may not be a great chance, but it's a chance."
For a midmajor program like Winthrop, reaching the N.C.A.A. tournament is the main goal, and the Eagles have achieved that four consecutive seasons. After an enigmatic season that included losses to Hartford and Niagara, the Eagles finished with seven straight victories, winning the Big South Conference tournament. As a reward for salvaging its season, Winthrop, which is playing about 90 minutes from its campus in Rock Hill, S.C., will have to chase Williams, bump Boozer and pressure Dunleavy.
"I think we can win if we play good defense and don't go in there afraid," Greg Lewis, the Big South player of the year, said. "They're not superhuman. They're not going through the whole thing undefeated, I don't think."
Those are strong words from Lewis, who also flippantly mentioned how Duke has "three or four lottery picks." That talent is why Duke drew about 3,000 fans for a brief workout, a cacophony of squeals and fans shouting "Jason!" or "Mike!" as if they were singers with synchronized dance moves.
"I don't know about rock stars," Dunleavy said. "I don't think 'N Sync gets booed."
Dunleavy said the Blue Devils "don't win the big one" unless they win "the little ones," and Winthrop is the first little one. For a powerhouse team like Duke, winning six more games is the perennial goal. Doing that would allow the Blue Devils to match the 1991-2 team with back-to-back titles. Before Duke, U.C.L.A. was the last to win at least two titles in a row; the Bruins won seven from 1967 to 1973.
Seventh-seeded Oklahoma State and 10th-seeded Kent State open the tournament games here at 12:20 p.m. Thursday, followed by No. 2 Alabama and 15th-seeded Florida Atlantic. Notre Dame, seeded eighth, plays No. 9 Charlotte at 7:40 p.m., and the Duke-Winthrop matchup will follow. Duke and Notre Dame, which is coached by Mike Brey, one of Krzyzewski's former assistants, could meet in the second round.
Duke is next. That may be the worst thing a team can hear this month.
"I hope they're a little nervous, nervous for the right reasons," Krzyzewski said of his team. "They're excited to play. It means something."

REBOUNDS
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People is planning to protest outside the Bi-Lo Center before the semifinal games on Saturday over the display of the Confederate flag at the South Carolina Statehouse. The N.A.A.C.P. called the flag a reminder of slavery and has continued to call for an economic boycott of the state. EDDIE SUTTON, the Oklahoma State coach, addressed the flag issue with a personal story. "My great-grandfather fought in the Civil War," he said. "It left a lot of wounds. I would think that by this time, 150 years later, we could all be one people."

Owners and Union Stake Out Different Views

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

DATELINE: PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla., March 13 

 BODY:
The players union came at baseball's competitive-balance problem from a different direction tonight, and the owners' negotiating committee did not like it.
 Management negotiators were waiting for the players to make a proposal on a luxury tax on payrolls and also to increase the percentage of local revenue the union had proposed that the clubs share. Instead, union negotiators proposed that clubs be permitted to trade players and draft choices in baseball's various drafts. In that proposal the union accepted the owners' idea of a worldwide amateur draft. 
 "We suggested a number of ways that you could transfer players and draft choices from clubs that are more well-situated by virtue of record and economics to those that are less well-situated," Donald Fehr, the union chief, said. "We think those will go a long way to bridge the gap on revenue-sharing and other issues. We hope they'll take a hard look at it."
Bob DuPuy, baseball's new president and chief operating officer, said the committee would study the proposal but added: "Our initial reaction is we're disappointed that it made no movement on revenue-sharing and had no competitive-balance tax. So what we view to be the two key elements in dealing with competitive balance remain untouched by them."
The owners have proposed a revenue-sharing plan under which clubs would share 50 percent of their local revenue and a luxury or competitive-balance tax of 50 percent on portions of payrolls over $98 million. The union has proposed that clubs share 22 1/2 percent of their local revenue, using a different method from the owners' plan, and want no tax on payrolls. "It's inappropriate to penalize someone for hiring someone," Fehr said.
The owners have proposed a competitive-balance draft in which the eight teams with the worst records would each select one player from the pool of players eligible for the draft of unprotected minor leaguers from the teams that participated in the postseason.
They have also proposed that all amateur players be subjected to a draft, not just those from the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico.

HEADLINE: Et Tu, America? The Politics of Fear 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Cicero Was Wrong" (column, March 12): Nicholas D. Kristof quotes a Latin dictum, "Oderint, dum metuant" ("Let them hate, so long as they fear"), as a popular way of thinking about foreign policy in the United States today. 
 Cicero quoted the phrase to criticize Marc Antony, his political rival, and he immediately pointed out the policy's failings. 
Yes, Rome could be savage in punishing rebels and recalcitrant enemies. But one reason for Rome's lasting success was that its statesmen tended to pursue a policy perhaps best articulated in Virgil's Aeneid: "to spare humbled foe, and crush to earth the proud."
Mr. Kristof advocates a foreign policy that respects other cultures while fostering economies, building infrastructure and helping people -- even former enemies -- in distress. Just such policies helped Rome prosper, grow and endure.

HEADLINE: BET Is Pulling Out of Harlem for Studios Downtown 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Black Entertainment Television, a cable television network aimed at African-American viewers, has broken off talks on moving its New York studios into a new building going up on 125th Street and Lexington Avenue and will leave Harlem altogether, the network said yesterday.
 Officials of BET said the network would give up its studio on 106th Street and Park Avenue, where more than 200 people work, because it needed more space for its news and music programs. BET will move its studios to the CBS Broadcast Center on 57th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues. BET is a subsidiary of Viacom, which also owns CBS. 
 Terry C. Lane, the chief executive of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, an economic development program, said that relocating the studio would be a big blow to Harlem residents, who welcomed BET to the neighborhood with great fanfare less than two years ago, only months before Viacom announced that it would acquire the profitable network. One of the network's most popular programs, which is performed live in front of a studio audience, is called "106 and Park."
United States Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Harlem Democrat, said he planned to protest BET's decision to its chief executive, Robert L. Johnson. "I'm very disappointed in this," Mr. Rangel said. "BET added a lot to our community. It was an image thing -- that a black entertainment network saw fit not just to come to New York City, but to come to Harlem. It was an exciting opportunity."
Despite strenuous efforts to bring commercial tenants to the neighborhood, most of the economic development in Harlem so far has consisted of low-paying retail jobs. The bulk of the office space is occupied by government agencies. Mr. Lane said he had hoped that BET's presence would encourage other businesses to come to Harlem, bringing better-paying jobs and providing good role models for young residents.
Mr. Lane said he had believed that the BET deal for 125th Street was imminent. "It's shocking," he said, referring to the breakdown in negotiations, which began in November. "Being in Harlem had assisted a lot in boosting their ratings and attracting more celebrities. It was very significant for them to have such a presence in Harlem." 
In a statement issued late yesterday, Debra L. Lee, the president and chief operating officer of BET, said the network remained committed to Harlem. "We will continue to look for programming opportunities in Harlem when feasible," she said. "BET will also remain open to the possibility of office space and production facilities in Harlem should our future business needs dictate additional expansion."
The network did not say when the move would take place.
Michael E. Lewellen, a spokesman for BET, said leasing real estate was not the only way to support a neighborhood. "There are lots of ways to be supportive of a community beyond bricks and mortar," he said.
Some black viewers have wondered whether BET, once the nation's 10th-largest black-owned business, will remain an independent voice now that it is owned by Viacom.
The network caused an uproar last year when it dismissed Tavis Smiley, a popular talk show host, saying that he had sold an exclusive interview to ABC. Mr. Smiley's fans flooded the network with e-mail messages, letters and telephone calls, citing the dismissal as evidence that BET was controlled by white executives. 
To keep BET in Harlem, the empowerment zone, a federal, state and city economic development program, had intended to make a $2 million loan at low interest rates to pay for the building of the new studio. The studio would have opened out onto the sidewalk, much like the "Today" show studio in Rockefeller Center and the "Good Morning America" studio in Times Square, Mr. Lane said. The network would have received tax credits for hiring local residents.
David Blumenfeld, the executive vice president of Blumenfeld Development Group, the developers of Gotham Plaza, the new building on 125th Street, said that Byron E. Marchant, the network's general counsel, informed him earlier this week that the deal was off because the 8,000-square-foot studio would be too small. Mr. Blumenfeld said that the blueprints had been redrawn to reduce the size of the studio from 10,000 square feet after BET told him the space was too large.
In all, the television network was to have leased 44,000 square feet, Mr. Blumenfeld said. With the subsidy, the annual rent worked out to $40.50 a square foot for a seven-year lease, he said.
Mr. Blumenfeld, who had been willing to rename the building after BET, said he had been so confident about the lease that he had turned away several retailers that had expressed interest in the ground-floor space. The 100,000-square-foot building is scheduled to be completed at the end of the summer, when the State Department of Motor Vehicles is supposed to open an office on the third floor. The retail tenants include Fleet Bank, Children's Place, Petland Discounts, Payless ShoeSource and Rockaway Bedding Centers. The project has already received a $3 million low-cost loan from the empowerment zone.

Big Investors Maintain Faith In WorldCom Despite Inquiry

BYLINE:  By PATRICK McGEEHAN with GERALDINE FABRIKANT 

 BODY:
Few people rely as heavily on the audited financial statements of public companies as do money managers who consider themselves true-blue value investors. So word this week of a federal investigation into the accounting of WorldCom sent a chill through the club of value investors who had bought up big stakes in it.
 WorldCom's shares fell 12 percent on Tuesday and another 7 percent yesterday after the company, the nation's second-biggest long-distance company and a major carrier of Internet data, said the Securities and Exchange Commission had asked for information about its accounting. With the company's stock price down more than 47 percent this year, some Wall Street analysts have soured on it. 
 But WorldCom's latest trouble has not shaken the faith of some of its biggest investors, including Charles Freeman, who manages the $15.3 billion Vanguard Windsor fund for the Vanguard Group. Mr. Freeman said he was not worried about WorldCom's accounting or the recent sale of about three million shares by a longtime director of the company.
At the end of 2001, Mr. Freeman's employer, Wellington Management, which manages the Windsor fund for Vanguard, was the biggest holder of Worldcom stock, with about 120 million shares. The stock was Windsor's third-largest holding at the end of the year, but its falling value has dropped it to ninth, even as Mr. Freeman has continued buying shares.
"My stomach doesn't like the stock," Mr. Freeman said yesterday in a telephone interview from his office in Radnor, Pa. But he took the uncharacteristic tack of publicly defending it, he said, because he felt so strongly that the market was punishing WorldCom unfairly by comparing it to companies with serious problems, like Global Crossing and Enron.
Mr. Freeman described WorldCom as a cyclical company that was being treated as if its "cyclically depressed earnings" would not rebound with the economy.
WorldCom has had a long fall from its peak of $62 in 1999. It traded for most of last year at $10 to $20. Mr. Freeman said his fund had long owned the stock but had bought heavily the last year because it was "just flat-out mispriced."
He added: "We've been buying the stock all the way down. It's a better value than it was at $12 or $13."
The Windsor fund had already accumulated most of its position when other members of the value-investing club piled into the stock last year. Oppenheimer Capital and Alliance Capital Management each acquired more than 30 million shares of WorldCom in the fourth quarter, according to federal filings.
Among mutual funds, two Oppenheimer value funds had some of the biggest bets on WorldCom last year, according to data supplied by Morningstar, a fund tracker in Chicago. The Oppenheimer Quest Balanced Value fund had more than 7 percent of its assets in WorldCom after buying more than eight million shares in the three months ended Oct. 31. The Oppenheimer Quest Opportunity Value fund had about 3.7 percent of its assets in Worldcom at the end of the year, according to Morningstar.
Neither the managers of those funds nor a representative of Oppenheimer Capital would comment on the Worldcom holdings.
Likewise, John Meyers, a spokesman for Alliance Capital, declined to comment on his company's large holdings in WorldCom. Alliance, which manages mutual funds, pension funds and private accounts, also owns Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, a value-oriented money manager. In all, Alliance had about 106 million shares of WorldCom at the end of last year. 
Alliance was burned by its ill-timed purchase of Enron stock last fall in the months leading up to the company's bankruptcy filing. Florida dismissed Alliance as a manager of its employee pension fund last November after the Enron purchase came to light.
The Florida pension fund owns more than nine million shares of WorldCom stock, said Lee Baldwin, a spokeswoman for the Florida State Board of Administration. But, she said, Alliance was not responsible for the WorldCom purchases. Wellington Management, a manager of the Florida pension fund, had bought some of the shares for the pension fund, she said. 
Mr. Freeman said he had no involvement in Wellington's Florida investments. But bullish as he is on WorldCom, he would not quibble with the decision to buy it.
Mr. Freeman argues that WorldCom is a relative bargain among technology companies. Its stock price is only about 10 times what it should earn per share this year, he said, compared with price-to-earnings ratios of more than 50 for Cisco Systems and almost 30 for Oracle. 
"Each of these companies is a leader in its niche," he said. "WorldCom's business is not as cyclical as those tech companies."
He also said that "WorldCom has the best set of assets in the long-distance business."
Mr. Freeman, who said he was not concerned about the S.E.C. inquiry, applauded the way that WorldCom's chief executive, Bernard J. Ebbers, had responded to it. Besides disclosing the fact of the S.E.C. inquiry, Worldcom took the unusual move of posting the commission's demand for information on its Web site (www.worldcom.com/investor).
Although the commission's inquiry includes questions about the amount of money Mr. Ebbers borrowed to buy WorldCom stock -- he now owes the company about $375 million -- Mr. Freeman said he did not see the loans as a problem. He characterized that situation as "the company's standing behind the C.E.O. who's standing behind the stock." 
One WorldCom director who did not appear to be standing behind the stock was Francesco Galesi. He acquired much of his stock in WorldCom through its acquisition in 1992 of a company he founded.
At the end of January, he sold some 2.9 million shares of his 4.7 million WorldCom shares at $8.95 to $9.42 a share, for a total of about $27 million.
Yesterday, Mr. Galesi said of his sale: "It had nothing to do with my opinion of the company at all. I have a lot of faith in WorldCom."

HEADLINE: House Hearing to Focus on the Performance of Enron's Lawyers 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13 

 BODY:
Documents obtained by Congressional investigators indicate that lawyers for Enron may have been aware of some of the most crucial facts about a partnership that played a significant role in the company's collapse, information that the company's own auditors say was withheld from them.
 It is not clear, however, that the lawyers were aware of the accounting implications of the transactions. The performance of Enron's lawyers will be the focus of a hearing Thursday before the House Energy and Commerce Committee. 
 The documents detail discussions involving internal Enron lawyers in 1997 about Chewco, a partnership that allowed Enron to keep significant amounts of debt off its balance sheet. For Chewco's accounting to meet legal standards, 3 percent of Chewco's equity, or about $11 million, had to come from a third party. Barclays, the large British bank, provided the money to entities called Big River and Little River, which were Chewco's investors. 
Barclays, however, required Big River and Little River to establish reserve accounts that were pledged to secure repayment. A special committee of Enron directors later found that "the existence of this cash collateral for the Barclays funding was fatal to Chewco's compliance with the 3 percent equity requirement." Thus debts that Enron had kept off its books because of Chewco should have been consolidated.
Notes from a Nov. 19, 1997, meeting of Enron lawyers show that Chewco's reserve account was discussed, stating that the account was "pledged to Big River/Little River banks." Notes of another meeting one month later also state that the "creation of reserve account" was to "benefit Big River/ Little River lenders." Investigators believe this may suggest that the Enron lawyers were aware that Barclays' money was not true equity at risk.
In other Enron developments, lawmakers on the House Financial Services Committee heard sharply differing views today of how far they should go to regulate auditors and ensure they are not tempted to go easy on clients because of other lucrative business dealings with them.
Representatives from the accounting industry and Wall Street said they supported many provisions in a proposal by House Republicans that would create a public accounting regulatory body with members drawn mostly from outside the industry and which would prohibit external auditors from doing certain consulting for clients.
Many critics of the current system have pointed out that auditors often face a conflict of interest because they may not want to offend clients that pay them big fees for consulting services. 
Other accounting and governing experts, praised the Republicans' bill but said that much more needed to be done, like banning auditors from performing all consulting and other nonauditing services for clients and requiring companies to rotate auditors.
Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America, said rotating auditors "would significantly reduce audit clients' ability to tame their auditors." 
Another witness today, Ted White, the director of corporate governance at the California Public Employees' Retirement System, urged lawmakers to prohibit external auditors from providing consulting or other services to their clients. "A firm should be an auditor or a consultant, not both to the same client," Mr. White said.
But Barry Melancon, the president of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, said that any legislation that effectively forces accountants to stick only with auditing will "create significant economic viability and audit quality concerns."
He suggested that requiring companies to rotate their auditors could actually lead to more audit failures, and he asserted that "there is a positive relationship between audit firm tenure and auditor competence."
Separately, the House Ways and Means Committee and the Education and Work Force Committee worked to hammer out language on pension legislation.
The differences have basically come down to jurisdictional issues, House staff members said, like whether new provisions might leave certain specific pension rules administered by both the Labor and Treasury Departments, potentially leading to conflicting rules and guidance.

PERSON: Harry V. Keefe Jr. 

HEADLINE: Harry Keefe Jr., 79, Innovator In Investments in Bank Stocks 

BYLINE:  By RIVA D. ATLAS 

 BODY:
Harry V. Keefe Jr., a founder of the Keefe, Bruyette & Woods brokerage firm and later a manager of an investment fund, died Friday at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
 The cause was a head injury after a fall, his wife, Anita, said. Mr. Keefe was 79 and lived in Greenwich, Conn. 
 Mr. Keefe was one of the first Wall Street securities analysts to specialize in bank stocks, and was also an adviser on several mergers that helped form large regional banks in the 1980's. 
Together with two partners, Gene Bruyette and Norbert Woods, he started Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in 1962 with just $50,000 in capital, Mr. Bruyette said.
The three men met while working at another brokerage firm, Tucker, Anthony & R. L. Day, where Mr. Keefe began his career in 1946 as a municipal bond salesman. "Research was very primitive then," Mr. Bruyette said.
In a 1984 interview, Mr. Keefe said: "I was the first person to compute a price-earnings ratio on bank stocks. They had traditionally been bought for their yields."
The firm specialized in regional banks and savings and loan associations, as opposed to the large, money center banks that were already being covered by the large brokerage firms, Mr. Bruyette said.
After changes in the laws governing bank mergers led to increasing combinations across state lines in the 1980's, Mr. Keefe became involved in forming some of the biggest banking companies in the country.
Mr. Keefe advised on two of the first interstate banking mergers: the 1985 combination of Sun Banks of Florida and the Trust Company of Georgia to form what is now known as SunTrust Banks, and First Atlanta's 1985 combination with the Wachovia Corporation.
"He was able to persuade clients because of the credibility and reputation for integrity he had created," said H. Rodgin Cohen, a longtime banking lawyer and chairman of Sullivan & Cromwell. 
When Mr. Keefe was advising First Atlanta on its friendly merger with Wachovia, the bank received a hostile offer from what was then the NCNB Corporation. Mr. Keefe persuaded his client to stick with Wachovia, even though the other bank's bid was higher, because he felt Wachovia's stock price would be higher in the long run.
"He was absolutely right," said Mr. Cohen, who was advising Wachovia at the time.
Mr. Keefe left Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in 1989 and formed an investment firm, Keefe Managers, which runs a $150 million hedge fund specializing in financial services stocks. Mr. Keefe came to the office daily, although he ceased to actively manage the firm's investments three years ago, said John Lyons, president of Keefe Managers.
Mr. Keefe was born on April 9, 1922, and grew up in Roslindale, Mass., a suburb of Boston, his wife said. He graduated from Amherst College with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1943.
Mr. Keefe served in the Navy during World War II and was the commanding officer of a landing craft during the invasion of Normandy. He narrowly escaped injury when his boat was hit by enemy fire, even though he was carrying several tons of explosives. After the war, he attended Boston University's Graduate School of Business.
In addition to his wife, he is survived by a daughter, Kathleen Raffel, of Rochester, Minn.; a son, Harry V. Keefe III, of Basking Ridge, N.J.; two stepsons, Geoffrey de Lesseps, of Manhasset, N.Y., and Thomas Verderber, of Garden City, N.Y.; and nine grandchildren.
Mr. Keefe was "personally devastated" by the large number of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods employees -- 67 out of the firm's staff of 224 -- who died in the World Trade Center attack Sept. 11, Mr. Lyons said.
In an interview with The Hartford Courant soon after the attack, Mr. Keefe told a reporter how stunned he was about what had happened.
"I made the invasion of Omaha Beach on D-Day," he said. "My ship got sunk by German fire, but I didn't lose a man. And here I sit comfortably in New York City. And suddenly 67 people I know are dead."

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Visits Washington to Make Friends and Influence People 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13 

 BODY:
In several meetings here today, Michael R. Bloomberg tried to assuage the concerns of leading members of Congress who have sharply questioned New York City's efforts to secure billions of dollars in federal aid.
 The mayor insisted that he was not in town to make any requests beyond the $21.5 billion that President Bush recently said he would provide New York to help it rebuild from the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center on Sept. 11. 
 Rather, he said, he wanted to assure top lawmakers on Capitol Hill that the money Washington sends to New York "will be well spent." 
"I am not here lobbying for anything," Mr. Bloomberg said before making the rounds on Capitol Hill. "I'm trying to see those people who I think need an explanation of what we have asked for and what we are trying to do." 
Mr. Bloomberg's trip was carefully timed, coming as Congress is not only set to consider the aid package that Mr. Bush promised New York, but also as the city seeks additional federal aid to help it deal with a potentially crippling budget gap.
Congressional leaders welcomed the mayor's visit and made vague pledges to continue helping the city through difficult times. But Mr. Bloomberg did not request or receive any firm commitments beyond those general reassurances.
An aide to Senator Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican who has forcefully questioned the amount of money New York has sought, said Mr. Bloomberg had reassured the senator by detailing how the city was spending the federal aid it is receiving. 
Representative Sonny Callahan, an Alabama Republican on the powerful House Appropriations Committee, echoed that sentiment, saying that the more "responsibly" the city handles its federal aid, "the more support" it will enjoy.
Mr. Bloomberg's trip came nearly a week after President Bush announced that he would move swiftly to fulfill the $20 billion commitment he made to New York in the days after the World Trade Center attack.
The aid package now needs the approval of Congress, where many lawmakers have expressed reservations about spending at a time when the nation is at war and the economy appears to be beginning to pull out of a recession.
But Mr. Bloomberg has other aid requests he is hoping Congress will honor, at a time when the city is struggling to close an anticipated budget gap of $4.7 billion beginning July 1.
The Bloomberg administration is counting on Washington to provide $146 million in additional Medicaid payments next year by increasing the share of Medicaid funding that the federal government provides the city.
The city also wants the federal government to provide $200 million next year for domestic security, as well as $80 million to help it cover the costs of protecting foreign dignitaries.
Mr. Bloomberg repeatedly went out of his way to say that he had no problem with the questions that prominent lawmakers on the Hill were raising.
"I think they have legitimate questions," he said. "It's our responsibility to explain to them why, in fact, this is a unique situation and why New York City is so important to this country."
The mayor gave a speech early this afternoon at the National Press Club, then arrived at the Capitol for a brief meeting with Mr. Callahan.
Some Congressional aides expressed surprise that Mr. Callahan, a relatively obscure lawmaker, wound up on Mr. Bloomberg's itinerary. But others described it as a masterstroke in public relations on behalf of a city that needs all the friends it can get in Washington.
"It was a smart trip for the mayor to make," said one senior aide who is a part of the Republican leadership in Congress. "It was very good for him to reach out."
Mr. Bloomberg then met with Representative Tom DeLay, a Republican from Texas who is the House majority whip, as well as Mr. Nickles, both of whom have been openly skeptical about the billions of dollars in federal aid for New York.
As much as anything, Mr. Bloomberg's visit here, his fourth since being elected mayor in November, was intended to highlight the presence that his aides say he hopes to establish in Washington.
New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat, said the mayor's presence was welcomed by the state's Congressional delegation, particularly now, with so much at stake for the city.
"It's relationship building, and it's smart," Mr. Schumer said. "He made it clear that he is going to be here regularly. That's going to make a big difference."

HEADLINE: Senate Deletes Higher Mileage Standard in Energy Bill 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13 

 BODY:
The Senate rejected a measure today to stiffen fuel-efficiency requirements for cars and trucks, once again resolving the perennial battle between environmentalists and the automobile industry in favor of the industry.
 Instead, the Senate voted to give the Transportation Department two years to study the need for new efficiency standards and how they would affect safety and employment. 
 Federal gasoline-use standards have not changed since 1985. The average mileage of vehicles sold in the United States, now about 24 miles per gallon, has been falling for years, largely because of the increasing popularity of sport utility vehicles. They use more fuel and are subject to less stringent standards than cars. 
A bipartisan team of senators led by John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona, argued that toughening the standards would reduce the nation's reliance on foreign oil and protect the environment.
But they were overwhelmed by senators from rural states and states with automobile factories -- backed by an expensive advertising campaign by carmakers and the United Automobile Workers, who argued that Congress had no right to tell Americans what kind of vehicles they should drive.
On the showdown amendment, the Senate voted 62 to 38 to delete specific mileage requirements from the comprehensive energy bill under consideration this month and to turn the matter over for study to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
On the vote, 43 Republicans and 19 Democrats were in favor of the study; 31 Democrats, 6 Republicans and the independent, James M. Jeffords of Vermont, wanted to keep tougher standards in the bill.
The Senate then voted 56 to 44 to exempt pickup trucks from any higher mileage rules the safety administration might recommend.
The issue of requiring cars and trucks to get better gasoline mileage arises almost every year, and the debate always follows a pattern similar to the one on gun control. 
Politicians mostly from the East and West coasts declare it ludicrous for Americans to drive gas-guzzling behemoths, just as they say it is for them to have free rein to own firearms.
But big cars and pickup trucks are a way of life in rural America, treasured like shotguns, and politicians from those areas do not want to offend their constituents.
As usual, ferocious lobbying and expensive advertising campaigns were mounted by both sides this year. But just as the gun control lobby is usually no match for the National Rifle Association, so the environmentalists do not have the deep pockets of the carmakers and the unions representing auto workers.
Standing at his front-row seat on the Senate floor before an enlarged photo of a tiny, purple, one-seat European car, Senator Trent Lott, Republican of Mississippi, asserted this morning, "I don't want Americans to have to drive this car."
Americans are interested in fuel efficiency, Mr. Lott, the minority leader, said, but they are even more concerned about automotive safety, comfort and performance. 
Senator Christopher S. Bond, Republican of Missouri, said stiffer mileage requirements would make golf carts the dominant means of transportation. "I don't want to tell a mom in my home state that she should not get an S.U.V. because Congress decided that would be a bad choice," Mr. Bond said.
Senator Kerry tried to counter this argument with the assertion that Detroit was capable of making more fuel-efficient cars, vans, trucks and sport utility vehicles without sacrificing safety.
One version of the measure he and Mr. McCain wrote would have raised the corporate average fuel efficiency, or CAFE, standards to 36 miles per gallon for all vehicles by 2016. Proponents say that could save up to 2.5 billion barrels of oil a day, about what is imported from the Middle East.
"No American will be forced to drive any different automobile," he said, pointing to an advertisement for a sport utility vehicle the Ford Motor Company plans to market next year that is much more fuel efficient than current models.
The issue, he said, was whether the United States could "save a significant amount of oil that we import from the Persian Gulf from countries that have the ability to dictate our future and simultaneously contribute to the effort to improve global warming problems as well as health in America."
But those in favor of stronger fuel-economy requirements could not muster the same passion as the opponents.
"American women love S.U.V.'s," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland, who lives in Baltimore, where there is a large General Motors plant. "When you are a soccer mom and you are picking up kids or you are car-pooling or have kids with gear, you need large capacity."
Senator Zell Miller, Democrat of Georgia, who sponsored the amendment exempting pickup trucks from higher standards, said he was protecting "hard-working people with calloused hands."
"As the pickup goes, so goes the heart and muscle of our country," Mr. Miller said, and he concluded, "Don't pick on the pickups."
Environmentalists lost on fuel efficiency, but they were likely to prevail later in the month by blocking a proposal to allow oil and gas exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northern Alaska.
Senator Tom Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, the majority leader, has promised that the Alaska drilling measure will be filibustered, and the proponents apparently do not have the 60 votes necessary to bring the matter to a vote.
This would mean that the two measures that could do the most to make the country less dependent on imported oil -- stronger fuel efficiency and tapping oil in the Alaskan wilderness -- would not be in the Senate's final energy legislation. 
What would remain would be more modest measures, including tax breaks to encourage alternative sources of fuel like wind and solar power and the imposition of tougher efficiency standards for air-conditioners and home appliances.
The measure will then go to conference with the House, which passed its energy bill last year. The House also rejected new mileage standards, but it approved oil and gas exploration in the wildlife refuge.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Blueprint for Budget Is Approved by House Panel 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13 

 BODY:
The House Budget Committee tonight adopted a Republican tax and spending plan for next year that would give President Bush the money he wants to combat terrorism but hold down the deficit by cutting or tightly limiting financing for many other programs.
 The $2.1 trillion election-year budget plan would increase military spending by $46.3 billion, or 13.3 percent, and nearly double, to $37.7 billion, money for domestic security needs like bioterrorism preparedness, border patrols, and training and equipment for fire and police departments. 
 But it would limit the overall increase in spending on nondefense programs to $4.6 billion, or 1.3 percent, less than the current annual rate of inflation. Environmental, energy, economic development and agriculture programs would be cut. Science and technology spending would effectively be frozen. Financing for education would rise at a much slower pace than in recent years. 
Even so, the Republican budget, for the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1, projects a deficit of $45.6 billion, after a deficit for the current year that it projects at $65.7 billion. The government ran surpluses the last four years.
The deficit figure for next year would have been even higher had the chairman of the committee, Representative Jim Nussle, Republican of Iowa, not broken with recent practice and used White House budget assumptions instead of more pessimistic figures developed by the Congressional Budget Office. Republican aides said that under Congressional Budget Office assumptions, the projection for next year would have been $80 billion.
The Republican-controlled committee passed the plan, or budget resolution, which provides a framework for Congress as it takes up annual spending bills, on a vote of 23 to 18 after defeating the major amendments presented by Democrats. The resolution now goes to the House floor, where Republican leaders hope to take it up next week. 
The Democratic-controlled Senate will write and take up its own budget resolution in coming weeks. Republicans said Democrats would not be able to do any better than the Republicans themselves in holding down the deficit while also financing the campaign against terrorism.
The House plan differed from Mr. Bush's budget proposal in a number of ways, seeking less in tax cuts and more for Medicare and highway spending. But Republican aides said that the House leadership and the White House had agreed to close ranks around the House plan and that Mr. Bush would be willing to threaten vetoes against any Democratic initiatives that would push spending higher.
The Republican budget "fully funds our priorities and at the same time restrains the growth of the rest of government," said one member of the Budget Committee, Representative Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania. 
Democrats said the Republican plan was proof that the tax cut pushed through Congress last year by Mr. Bush had been fiscally reckless. They noted that the Republicans' own figures showed the government using $830.5 billion of Social Security receipts for general government operations over the next five years, shattering the bipartisan pledge of the last few years to use the temporary surplus in Social Security to pay down the national debt.
They also said the Republicans were trying to obscure the long-term ramifications of the tax cut and their other policies by limiting budget projections to five years rather than the 10 years that has become standard.
Democrats said the Republicans were leading the government down a path to at least a decade of significant deficits at a time when the nation should be preparing for the huge costs of paying retirement and health care benefits for the baby-boom generation.
"In the war against terrorism, we are united behind the president and are unstinting about the cost," said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the committee. But on the rest of the budget, he added, Democrats have "major differences" with Republicans.
The debate today was different from the mood of last year, when the two parties had before them a projected budget surplus of $5.6 trillion for the coming decade. Now most of the surplus has been gobbled up by the tax cut, the weak economy and the costs of fighting terrorism. 
But Democrats have been wary, to the point of paralysis, of advocating rolling back or delaying components of the tax cut to make more room for their policies. To some degree, both parties are banking on a strong rebound by the economy to bring back the surplus.
Republicans said they had not given up on their push to make the 10-year tax cut enacted last year permanent, a step that would add hundreds of billions of dollars to a 10-year budget but would have little effect on the five-year plan taken up by the committee today. 
But in an indication of the fiscal squeeze, the five-year plan made room for just $28 billion in new tax cuts from 2003 through 2007.

HEADLINE: Remote Towns Sell Safety in Shadow of Sept. 11 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: MARTINSVILLE, Va. 

 BODY:
For most of its recent life, this small town in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains has had a hard time luring new business. The textile and furniture factories closed or migrated overseas, and Martinsville was simply too isolated to attract others.
 After Sept. 11, officials here and in some other small towns hoped that this very liability could be transformed into something valuable to sell corporate America: safety. 
 Which is why a three-story granite building abandoned two years ago by a bankrupt textile corporation was recently turned into what Martinsville is calling a Disaster Recovery Center. 
In the vision of the town's planners, the center, smelling of fresh paint and new carpeting, would hold copies of vital electronic databases for big city companies that could lose their information in terrorist attacks. 
"It's for companies who need a remote off-site location for data recovery and data backup services," said Thomas L. Harned, director for economic development in Martinsville. "It could be terrorism, hurricane, flood. They like to have sites that are physically remote from their main operations. We are actively working with some potential clients to develop that as a marketing niche for this area."
But for all its efforts, Martinsville may wait a long time for new business arising from the threat of terrorism, even as the national economy starts to turn around. While some new businesses have moved to town, none have come out of fear of attacks. In an otherwise fast-growing state, Martinsville's population sank 4.6 percent in the 1990's, to 15,416, and unemployment is about 20 percent. At the same time, the fear of attack is so remote here that no guards, badges or metal detectors control access to public buildings, and visitors roam them uninspected and unimpeded. 
That atmosphere, some corporate relocation consultants say, should, in theory, be an enticement to some companies looking for security. "There's more focus on risk -- natural disaster risk and human-induced risk," said Dennis J. Donovan, director of global site selection services at the Wadley-Donovan Group, part of the Grubb & Ellis Company. "We are being instructed by our clients now to look at the proximity to nuclear power plants, other electrical generation facilities, natural gas pipelines, water treatment plants, bridges and major tourist facilities."
Some companies might also weigh the rising cost of property insurance in places considered exposed to terrorism, some experts said. Premiums being charged building owners in New York City have soared since the attacks. 
"It's a risk-management issue," said Jim Schriner, a partner and relocation consultant at Deloitte & Touche, the accounting firm. Before Sept. 11, Mr. Schriner said, property insurance was a minor consideration. Now it could be a heavy burden for tenants of skyscrapers and businesses near military installations, for example. "Nobody thought it was possible to lose an entire building or to lose access to your building," Mr. Schriner said. 
But how far away companies will be willing to go remains an open question, as some entrepreneurs have found. In Kingston, N.Y., only an hour and a half up the Hudson from New York, Alan Ginsberg, who owns 2.5 million square feet of abandoned I.B.M. buildings, envisions selling much of it to companies for data storage. 
Immediately after Sept. 11, "the phone was ringing off the hook," Mr. Ginsberg said. "People we had never heard of were asking about a data center," he said. "But nothing materialized. They decided to stay in New York or go to New Jersey." 
With the recession apparently over, Mr. Ginsberg said, interest in the site is picking up, but he still has no new tenants. 
In the only occupied office in Martinsville's newly renovated building, Tommy Rogers, former director of technologies for Bassett Furniture Industries, is leading the city's effort to establish the disaster recovery center. 
"With a good disaster recovery plan," Mr. Rogers said, a company in Richmond or Arlington, Va., or closer in Greensboro or Raleigh, N.C., would transmit copies of all its data to a computer it would install here. An employee at the far-off office, Mr. Rogers said, would not "even know he's communicating with another site." 
Martinsville and other small towns were initially wary of appearing to exploit the tragedies in New York and Washington and have courted new business gingerly. "We'd never try to market an area to the detriment of another," said Mr. Harned, Martinsville's economic development director. "But I think our message is implicit. When we talk about the quality of life, public safety is a part of it." 
In Bottineau, N.D., population 3,000, officials have been speaking the same language. 
"The attacks made everybody stop back and look at our country as a whole," said Dean Ihla, executive director of the Bottineau Chamber of Commerce. "What may have been perceived as isolation in the past is safety and security."

HEADLINE: U.S. Admits That Politics Was Behind Steel Tariffs 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER L. RICH 

DATELINE: SAO PAULO, Brazil, March 13 

 BODY:
The United States trade representative, Robert B. Zoellick, told Brazilian business leaders today that domestic politics was behind the new American tariffs on steel imports from Brazil and elsewhere. 
 "We are committed to moving forward with free trade, but, like Brazil, we have to manage political support for free trade at home," Mr. Zoellick said. "We have to create coalitions." 
 The Bush administration angered many United States trading partners last week when it announced tariffs of up to 30 percent on most imported steel, to be imposed for three years. The tariffs were needed, the administration said, to give the American steel industry time to reorganize and make itself more competitive with global rivals. 
In Brazil, the tariffs were taken as more evidence that the United States was not willing to be held to the principles of trade liberalization that it has advocated for other nations in forums like the round of global trade talks inaugurated in Doha, Qatar, last November.
Brazil's president, Fernando Henrique Cardoso, strongly criticized the steel tariffs at the opening of the Inter-American Development Bank meeting in Fortaleza on Monday, saying that they contradicted the principles underlying the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas, which negotiators hope to inaugurate in stages beginning in 2005.
"The path to strengthening multilateral trade is not the path of protectionism," Mr. Cardoso said. "And it is certainly not the path of discretionary antidumping or agricultural subsidies used in scandalous proportions to impede free competition."
Mr. Zoellick said that seven-eighths of the Brazilian steel imported by the United States would not be affected by the new tariffs. Most steel was excluded, he said, "as a sign of our partnership and constructive economic integration with Brazil." 
But Maria Silva Bastos Marques, the president of Brazil's largest steel maker, Cia. Siderurgica Nacional, and of the Brazilian Steel Institute, a trade association, said that the steel sector stood to lose $1 billion in sales over the next three years because of the tariffs. Mills will postpone plans for heavy investments to expand production, she said. Union leaders have said up to 5,000 jobs will be affected. 
In a conference call with reporters, Ms. Bastos Marques said that the steel industry had proposed responding to the American move by raising Brazil's tariffs on some finished steel products imported from the United States and elsewhere to protect the local market from what she expects will be a flood of inexpensive steel diverted from the American market.
Steelworkers protested the American tariffs outside the United States consulate today and called for Brazilian tariffs. The demonstration, as often happens here, took on more of the air of a block party. Steelworkers and their supporters barbecued hamburgers and danced in swimsuits and Uncle Sam hats between protest chants. 
"We aren't against the F.T.A.A., but we think that the government needs to impose new tariffs on some goods coming from the United States so that we can negotiate on even footing," said Paulo Pereira da Silva, the president of the Forca Sindical, an umbrella labor organization in Sao Paulo. 
So far, the Brazilian government has been cautious about the idea of retaliatory tariffs, and Mr. Zoellick warned against adopting them. "That action would create a further sense of market uncertainty for companies thinking about doing business in Brazil," Mr. Zoellick said. "Brazil needs to show stability to draw investment."
American actions connected to agricultural trade have also been a growing irritant for Brazilians, who are major exporters of many agricultural commodities. Moves by Congress to exempt some agricultural goods from bills granting President Bush a relatively free hand to negotiate trade treaties were taken here as a sign that Washington would go on subsidizing farmers in ways Brazil has called unfair.
Brazilian cotton growers proposed this week that the government impose antidumping measures against American cotton. And the country is considering bringing a complaint to the World Trade Organization over American "equalization taxes" on orange juice that it says discriminate against foreign growers.

HEADLINE: ART REVIEW; 
The Splendor of Tapestries Both Opulent and Complex

BYLINE:  By HOLLAND COTTER 

 BODY:
There's just no other way to put it. "Tapestry in the Renaissance: Art and Magnificence" is one of the most stupefying displays of sheer material luxe I've seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in years. And considering this institution's penchant for imperious size and material razzle-dazzle, that's saying something.
 The exhibition is a kind of summit conference for one of the great forms of textile art as it was produced in the West in the 15th and 16th centuries. Each of the 41 tapestries included, most of them flown in from European churches and museums, is a premier example of its kind, and each has the larger-than-life presence of a personage. As you move through the show you stop in front of one piece and think: "Well, this is the ultimate," the most opulent, the most complex, the most something. Until you reach the next one, which in its turn seems impossible to top. 
 The Met was smart to go for this pageantlike effect of massed splendor. Tapestry can do with a bit of advocacy today, though it certainly didn't need it centuries ago. In the Middle Ages and later in the Renaissance it was valued as much than painting, or more, in part because it was often made of precious materials -- silk and gold-and-silver-wrapped thread -- but also because of its versatility. 
For a European monarch on the move, tapestries provided a court on wheels. You could take these big, brilliantly colored, roll-up pictures with you on the road, hang them wherever you were and, presto, you had a sumptuous wraparound setting that wowed your guests, made political points and kept you warm, to boot.
In the long run, though, portability was a killer. Rich textile surfaces wore out; light-sensitive colors faded. As often as not tapestries were cut up or discarded or put to abject uses. (The Met's seven-piece "Hunt of the Unicorn" set -- a section of which is in the show -- was discovered on a French farm in the 19th century being used to protect vegetable beds from frost.)
Changing taste has also taken a toll. For modern viewers, art means painting, sculpture, maybe photography. Everything else, including tapestry, is handicraft and of lesser status. And the tapestry we do pay attention to mostly fits in a medieval art niche. The innovative woven work of the Renaissance, for which top-flight painters like Raphael and Bernaert van Orley created designs, is little known.
The Met show -- organized by Thomas Campbell, associate curator of European sculpture and decorative arts and supervising curator of the Antonio Ratti Textile Center at the Met -- will surely broaden this view. From start to finish the work is spectacular. It comes in all sizes, from modest to colossal. Most of the content is narrative, with subjects ranging from biblical epic to action-adventure to docu-drama. The major sources of high-end tapestry production are accounted for, from northern centers like Brussels and Tournai to short-lived workshops in Italy and France.
We plunge right into the world of Netherlandish design in the first gallery with a cinematic battle scene titled "The Death of Troilus, Achilles and Paris," probably woven in Tournai toward the end of the 15th century. The theme is Homeric, but all traces of the neo-Classical style then current in Italian art -- one-point perspective, volumetric modeling, idealized forms -- are absent.
Instead, we have a dizzy, jigsawlike patchwork of figures on a tipped-up millefleur ground, with sequential events scattered here and there. Such compositional madness actually served a purpose. Even if the tapestry was partly obscured by bulky furniture, viewers would still have plenty of juicy anecdotes to look at.
Then came a revolution. In 1515 in Rome, Raphael was commissioned to create a tapestry cycle for the Sistine Chapel, on scenes from the biblical Acts of the Apostles. Following custom, he drew the initial designs, which with the help of assistants he enlarged to full-scale, full-color cartoons. The cartoons were shipped to Brussels for weaving.
Three of these tapestries are in the Met show, and the difference between them and their Netherlandish equivalents from roughly the same time is night and day. In Raphael's pictures, the world, so clogged and vacuum-packed in northern designs, is cleared out and stripped down, with figures grouped like sculptural tableaus within receding landscapes of earth, water and sky.
For the Brussels-based artist van Orley (circa 1491-1541), these cartoons were a revelation. Up to that point he had worked in the Netherlandish mode, notably in his monumental allegories on the virtues of an ideal ruler. (A single piece from that series, "Nobilitas," is one of the show's early high points.) But one look at Raphael, and he knew there was a whole other way to go.
For him it took intriguingly hybrid directions. In his four-piece "Alba Passion," probably woven around 1525, he mixed equal parts Raphael and Durer in an energetic, somewhat fidgety expressive blend. He perfected this north-south synthesis in a 12-piece tapestry set known as "The Hunts of Maximilian," commissioned by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and ruler of the Netherlands, in 1528.
On one level, the series is an allegorical depiction of the months of the year. But many of its figures seem to be portraits and the series as a whole functions as a big-budget piece of political advertising. In the December hunt scene on view at the Met, for example, the central figure, seen charging a wild boar, is probably a likeness of Charles's brother Ferdinand engaged in a ritualistic blood sport traditionally associated with monarchical bravery.
It's always a little hard to know what to do with such images. Even allowing for changes in cultural context, is there any real difference between this version of macho valor and that in the latest Schwarzenegger film? In the case of the tapestry, though, something called art intervenes, shifting attention from the grisly subject to the stunning object, with its golden sheen and its wealth of realistic details, all -- impossibly -- woven, not painted or drawn.
In a sense, such technical finesse is the show's main attraction. The mural-size tapestry titled "The Unity of the State," woven in 1540 to 1547 for the French king Francis I at Fontainebleau, is a silly thing, a promotional portrait of the monarch tarted up in Roman-consular garb. But the decorative exuberance of the piece -- the friezelike fruits and putti, the mythological tableaus, the architectural flourishes -- is so exquisitely wrought that you end up bypassing the political puffery to wonder how on earth the weavers did all this with just colored thread.
And that's true right up to the work that ends the show, a scene from the biblical story of Joseph that is designed, with characteristically bizarre suavity, by the Italian Mannerist painter Agnolo Bronzino. It was woven in the early 1550's, and within a decade or so tapestry production in northern Europe fell on hard times. Political unrest and economic travails brought the collapse of the major workshops, and although tapestry was revived in the 17th century, it lost its integral role in European art.
So it has come down to us as an oddball medium, at once fusty and exotic. Yet when properly presented, its conceptual ambition and tactile immediacy come through. You get a vivid sense of both on a visit to the Cloisters, the Met's outpost for medieval art in northern Manhattan, where the rest of "The Hunt of the Unicorn" is on display.
But for a one-shot immersion of its Renaissance glory, "Tapestry in the Renaissance: Art and Magnificence" is the answer to a prayer. The work gathered here is art beyond question, magnificent beyond description, and it is not likely to come this way again, in such staggering quantity and quality, for another lifetime or two.
"Tapestry in the Renaissance: Art and Magnificence" remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1000 Fifth Avenue, at 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through June 19.

HEADLINE: European Meeting Will Focus on Freer Rein for Economy 

BYLINE:  By EMMA DALY 

DATELINE: BARCELONA, Spain, March 14 

 BODY:
As leaders of the 15 European Union nations gather here for a two-day summit meeting that begins on Friday, the main question before them is how to go about translating high-flown goals of economic liberalization into reality on the ground.
 The group's leaders agreed two years ago in Lisbon to turn Western Europe into "the world's most competitive and dynamic economy" by 2010. Other than completing the introduction of the new euro currency in 12 of the 15 nations, though, the organization has made little practical progress on new liberalization measures since the Lisbon meeting. 
 Spain, the host nation for this week's gathering, is pushing its partners to make headway on a number of areas in which Europe is seen as lagging behind the United States. 
"It is vital that we attend with the aim of achieving concrete results that will allow us to reach the objectives our citizens demand: more employment, a better capacity for growth and more prosperity for all," Jose Maria Aznar, Spain's prime minister, wrote to his European counterparts this week.
Mr. Aznar, whose economic policies favor free markets and less regulation, identified the union's main priorities as job creation, education and training, the development of a single market in financial services, and the integration of European energy, transportation and communications networks.
Of these, the most attention has been paid to energy. The European Parliament approved draft legislation this week that would allow cross-border energy competition by 2005. The European Commission's president, Romano Prodi, has warned that failing to free the energy sector would cost consumers and businesses 15 billion euros a year.
But analysts say it is unlikely that the national leaders will reach an agreement on energy liberalization at the meeting. France has already said it is unwilling to give up its national electricity and gas monopoly, at least as far as service to consumers is concerned.
Even the two chief political antagonists in France, President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who are opponents in the coming presidential election, have set aside their hostility to present a united front on the energy issue. Neither is willing to face the wrath of labor unions, which fear that "liberalization" means job losses.
French officials point to the service disruptions, price spikes and blackouts that plagued California last year as evidence of the perils of headlong deregulation of energy markets. And the debacle at the Enron Corporation, often seen as an avatar of energy deregulation, has not made the cause more popular.
A Spanish official said today that the energy question was "60 percent" resolved because France had agreed to allow competition by 2005 among companies supplying energy to industrial customers. The European Union's energy commissioner, Loyola de Palacio, has been pushing for the full deregulation of electricity and gas by that time, and he has urged France to give ground on the issue to "avoid radical measures," like the imposition of the reforms by a decree from the organization.
Jordi Gual, an economics professor at the IESE Business School of the University of Navarra in Barcelona, said it was crucial that the summit meeting make progress on integrating markets for services like energy, transportation, communications and financial services. "That is the acid test of this meeting," he said, "to get things moving in these dimensions, especially the one highlighted as the star of this meeting, which is energy markets."
If nothing concrete is achieved, Professor Gual said, "the momentum lost would be tremendous."
Labor constraints are also on Mr. Aznar's list of priorities. The European Union, he said, "must attack the structural elements that make the labor market function deficiently." He wants changes in laws that make it slow, difficult and expensive to lay off workers in many countriesbecause, he said, the laws make employers reluctant to hire when there is any uncertainty about the future. 
Labor unions want more hiring as well, but not at the cost of protections against layoffs.
Some 100,000 people marched through Barcelona today to demand full employment with social rights. "We want a Europe of the workers and not only a Europe of the companies, of the big enterprises," said Mimmo Arienzo, an Italian union member who took part.
Another large demonstration is expected on Saturday, when leaders of antiglobalization protests hope that 50,000 people will demonstrate against what the organizers call "the Europe of capitalism and war."
Mr. Aznar's office said it expected the protests to be peaceful. "We have made contact with the social groups involved," a spokesman for Mr. Aznar told reporters, "and the impression that we have is that it will take place in an aura of calm and that there is an attitude of responsibility. Naturally it is impossible to rule out that there might be acts of violence."
About 9,000 Spanish police officers are patrolling the city now. Concerned that ETA, the Basque separatist group, may try an attack, Spanish authorities have tightened border restrictions and are searching cars entering the city.

HEADLINE: Cohen Is Appointed Times Foreign Editor 

 BODY:
The appointment of Roger Cohen as foreign editor of The New York Times was announced yesterday by Howell Raines, the executive editor. 
 Mr. 
Cohen, 46, became deputy foreign editor last August and acting editor in September, when the editor, Andrew Rosenthal, was promoted to assistant managing editor. 
 In making the appointment, effective immediately, Mr. Raines said: "This appointment makes formal the leadership role Roger Cohen has played from the moment he took over the foreign desk on the eve of the World Trade Center disaster. His planning of the staffing and coverage of the war in Afghanistan produced some of The Times's best battlefield reporting."
Earlier, Mr. Cohen served as chief of The Times's Berlin bureau, as a Paris correspondent, as Balkan bureau chief and as European economic correspondent, based in Paris. He joined The Times in New York in 1990 after working as a foreign correspondent for The Wall Street Journal and for Reuters. He received a master's degree in history and French from Oxford University in 1977.
Mr. Cohen is the author of "Hearts Grown Brutal: Sagas of Sarajevo" (Random House, 1998), an account of the violent breakup of Yugoslavia, and a co-author of "In the Eye of the Storm" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1991), a biography of Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf.

HEADLINE: Reports Offer More Evidence That Economy Is Improving 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14 

 BODY:
Fewer Americans are seeking jobless aid and United States businesses are building inventories, government data released today showed, adding more evidence that the economy is on higher ground.
 The number of workers who filed for first-time state unemployment benefits edged down last week to a seasonally adjusted 377,000 from 380,000, the Labor Department said. The report continues a downward trend in the number of unemployed workers, which began at the start of this year. 
 Adding to that brighter employment outlook, separate figures from the Commerce Department showed that companies unexpectedly increased inventories in January, anticipating higher demand from consumers and businesses.
"I think that we are even more conclusively in a recovery," said Mark Vitner, an economist at Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C. "It's really hard to deny the fact that the economy has taken a turn for the better."
It was the 10th consecutive week that initial jobless claims remained below the 400,000 level, which analysts consider recessionary.
The four-week moving average for jobless claims, a more reliable measure because it irons out weekly gyrations, also showed a generally positive trend. It edged up slightly, to 374,750 from 373,750 a week earlier, but remained substantially below levels seen earlier in the year.
The 0.2 percent increase in business inventories in January, the first gain in a year, was a surprise but a welcome one to analysts who were expecting companies to continue liquidating their stockpiles.
The inventory sell-off, which had been occurring over the last few months as companies battled the recession, had been dragging down economic growth as measured by gross domestic product, the government's broadest measure of economic activity.
While companies were building their inventories, sales picked up, the report said. Total business sales in January rose 1.1 percent, with a 2.0 percent gain at manufacturers.
A separate Labor Department report today showed that United States import prices fell unexpectedly in February, the eighth decrease in nine months and one that outweighed sizable gains in petroleum prices.
While economists attribute the fall in import prices to the dollar's strength against other major currencies, they said the report added still more comfort to their outlook for low inflation.

HEADLINE: A Failure of Energy 

 BODY:
Americans should be outraged at the Senate's vote on Wednesday to compromise important national security and environmental concerns in order to please the auto industry and its unions. That is precisely what took place when 62 senators, as part of the ongoing debate on new energy legislation, rejected a long-overdue effort to increase fuel efficiency standards by 50 percent over 13 years. Doing so promised ultimately to save 2.5 million barrels of oil a day, more than is currently imported from the Middle East. 
 The average mileage for vehicles sold in America has dropped to 24 miles per gallon, the lowest level since 1980. The standard for cars, set in 1985, is an average 27 miles, but the broader average is falling due to the increasing popularity of S.U.V.'s and minivans. These are classified, absurdly enough, as light trucks, and therefore must meet only a 20.7-mile-per-gallon standard. 
 In mimicking the House's failure last year to raise the standards or close the gap between S.U.V.'s and cars as part of a broader energy bill, the Senate seemed to shut its eyes to the historic moment. Senators acted as if the California energy crisis had never taken place, and as if the industrialized world were not increasingly concerned about its dependence on fuel imports from a turbulent Middle East. 
The tenor of the debate in the Senate was near hysteria, with members practically warning of Bolshevik-like attempts to take the family minivan away from soccer moms across the land. This is more about ideology than economics. After all, the National Academy of Sciences issued a report last summer concluding that stiffer fuel efficiency standards could be attained at a reasonable cost and without overly jeopardizing auto safety. Japanese manufacturers already do far better. 
The sad truth is that Detroit's automakers, big labor and their rural Congressional allies are adamantly opposed to any and all new limits on the country's gas-guzzling freedoms. So a majority of senators would have you believe that technology has not advanced enough in the last 15 years to justify a change in the standards. 
The Senate faces a series of other important votes in its energy bill deliberations, and must do better in standing up for the public interest. A good start would be to oppose a dilution of sensible renewable-energy requirements on utilities as well as the Bush administration's proposed rollback of new, tougher efficiency standards for air-conditioners. 
Senators should also hold firm in opposing oil and gas drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which the House has approved. This environmentally reckless scheme would do far less to promote energy independence, at a far greater cost to the nation, than a revision of the energy efficiency standards would have accomplished.

HEADLINE: State May Aid Public TV Stations In Shift to Digital Transmission 

BYLINE:  By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
Still reeling from the World Trade Center attack and a drop in charitable giving, New York's nine public television stations have won support from legislators in Albany for aid in converting to digital signals, a plan that could cost taxpayers more than $50 million. 
 The proposal, which has majority-party sponsorship in the Senate and Assembly, is a new approach to helping the stations enter the digital era. The move to digital signals from analog is expensive and is a technological leap, television's equivalent to the introduction of FM frequencies on the radio dial in the 1940's. 
 Under the Senate and Assembly bills, which are virtually identical, the state would pay about $30 million, or about 25 percent of the estimated $120 million price tag for nine stations. The stations would pick up most of the additional costs. Aides to Gov. George E. Pataki, who has been criticized for the amount of debt that the state has taken on in his seven years in office, have indicated that he will sign the bills if they pass in both houses. The state would borrow the $30 million by selling bonds, and then taxpayers would repay the principal and as much as $20 million in interest. 
Digital transmission sharply improves visual and audio quality and introduces interactive functions, allowing television sets to operate more like computers connected to the Internet. Viewers can do such things as pick which stocks scroll across the screen during financial news programs and click on boxes during educational shows to get more information.
The Federal Communications Commission has demanded that all commercial stations begin digital transmission this year and that all public stations begin by May 2003. Despite requests for a postponement in the wake of the terrorist attacks, the F.C.C. has not relented on the deadline for its plan to move television stations to digital frequencies and then sell all analog broadcast frequencies by 2006. The analog frequencies will most likely be sold to wireless telephone and other telecommunications providers.
The compressed nature of digital signals allows stations to offer up to four channels for every one channel of programming they have now. WXXI-TV, a public television station in Rochester, for example, plans to offer one channel of general programming, a children's channel and an adult education channel. 
In return for the assistance, each of the stations has agreed that one of its additional channels will be educational programming.
"I had hoped it could be done without borrowing money," said Senator John R. Kuhl Jr., a Republican of Steuben County who sponsored the legislation. "But we are more limited because of 9/11 and the revenue shortfall. But digital television is too important to the educational community, and our backs are against the wall."
WNET-TV (Channel 13), New York City's public television station, lost its transmitter and other equipment for its digital conversion in the trade center attack. That was a severe setback to the station, which had already begun transmitting digitally and had taken out loans to pay for its $27 million investment into conversion. Some of the state's stations have also suffered sharp drops in fund-raising because of the soft economy, officials added.
"The broad view is that we in the public television industry have been mandated by the government to go digital and give back our frequencies," said William F. Baker, WNET's president. "The commercial stations will be able to make hundreds of millions of dollars off of this, but we won't."
Commercial broadcast stations will have a quick return on their investments, because many will gain three additional channels, quadrupling the opportunity for advertising dollars. Public stations, which are barred from accepting advertising, are having a much harder time paying the costs of conversion. The stations can collect money in sponsorships, in which corporations pay the costs associated with a program. (Under F.C.C. guidelines, advertising needs to have a "call to action," while a sponsorship does not.)
In 2000, Governor Pataki signed a bill that subsidized the conversion of commercial broadcast stations by exempting the purchase of production and transmission equipment from state sales tax. So far, 32 other states have passed public television aid packages. 
New York's nine stations have agreed to divide the money evenly, regardless of size or cost of conversion. The stations are WNET; WXXI; WLIW on Long Island; WMHT in Schenectady; MLPBS in Plattsburgh; WPBS in Watertown; WNED in Buffalo; WSKG in Binghamton; and WCNY in Syracuse.

HEADLINE: New Welfare Director Defends Stance on Food Stamp Waiver 

BYLINE:  By NINA BERNSTEIN 

 BODY:
Verna Eggleston, the new commissioner of the Human Resources Administration, told City Council members yesterday that she was strengthening the agency's oversight of private welfare-to-work contracts and its support services for those who have moved into jobs.
 Under persistent but friendly questioning by Bill de Blasio, chairman of the Council's general welfare committee, Ms. Eggleston first defended her agency's refusal to accept a federal waiver from food stamp rules, but then agreed that if the economy worsened and workfare assignments fell short of demand from hungry applicants, she would reconsider. 
 Over all, her testimony seemed to steer a careful course between overt praise and oblique criticism of the Giuliani administration's legacies on welfare. "I will continue to emphasize the 'work first' approach," Ms. Eggleston said. "However, I want to be sure we bring integrity and compassion to the work we do."
She said she had created a Contracts Review Board to help ensure "that all contracts are awarded fairly and provide the best value to taxpayers." 
Under her predecessor, Jason A. Turner, welfare-to-work contracts came under fire first because of his ties to a company that won a contract, and later because of complaints that contracts rewarded companies more for placing welfare recipients in jobs quickly than for keeping them employed after they were cut from the rolls. An appeals court eventually upheld the contracts, but criticism has continued. 
The sharpest disagreement came over the food stamp waiver, which had been opposed on ideological terms by Mr. Turner's allies.
The exchange between Mr. de Blasio and Ms. Eggleston underscored confusion over the waiver, which is available to regions with insufficient jobs. The waiver would allow jobless adults seeking work to receive food stamps beyond the current limit of three months in a three-year period. "If someone's acting in good faith and they need food, the city government should be flexible enough to get them food," Mr. de Blasio said, adding that 24,000 people could be affected. Ms. Eggleston replied by asking how she could require a single mother of nine children to work while waiving the requirement for a single adult without such responsibilities. "Sir, I will not," she declared. 
Under federal food stamp regulations, families cannot be denied food stamps just because the head of the household is not working. The family of 10 in Ms. Eggleston's example -- a rarity since the typical public assistance household is a family of three -- would be entitled to $1,018 in food stamps monthly, according to the Department of Agriculture.
The single adult in her example would be eligible for $135 a month in food stamps, but only for three months over three years. A waiver would have allowed an unemployed person who had reached that limit to receive the food stamp allotment and hunt for a job without also having to apply for welfare and do workfare. 
At the same hearing, council members challenged Linda Gibbs, commissioner of homeless services, about plans to cut prevention programs like rent assistance while spending more on shelter beds, including 1,600 hotel rooms at an average of $91 a night. 
Ms. Gibbs promised to complete a plan that would include prevention plans and permanent housing. But at this point, she said, she must meet the budget gap and the immediate demands of rising homelessness.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Blue-Chip Shares Edge Higher, but Nasdaq Issues Slump

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks inched higher yesterday on a reassuring profit forecast by Eastman Kodak, but technology shares sagged for a fourth consecutive session in light trading amid worries that profits in the sector would not rebound as soon as investors hoped.
 "We actually had a pretty good week last week, and now we're just digesting some of that; I think we might have gotten a little bit ahead of ourselves," said Rafael Tamargo, director of equity research at Wilmington Trust, which oversees around $16 billion. "Part of the reason you get worried is the valuation on the overall market isn't really, really cheap." 
 News that fewer Americans are seeking jobless claims and businesses are building inventories underscored growing expectations for a pickup in the sagging economy, but the raging debate over just how strong the recovery will be put a cap on investors' enthusiasm.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 15.29 points, or 0.15 percent, to 10,517.14.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index slipped 7.89 points, or 0.42 percent, to 1,854.14, while the broad Standard & Poor's 500-stock index eased 1.05 points, or 0.09 percent, to 1,153.04.
Thin trading volumes kept major market gauges wandering in narrow ranges throughout the day. Volume was 1.485 billion shares on the Nasdaq -- just above this year's low of 1.480 billion. About 1.2 billion shares were traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
Eastman Kodak rose $1.35, to $32.35. The company reiterated its first-quarter and full-year earnings forecast for the second time in less than three weeks.
Lucent Technologies shed 9 cents, to $4.83, and ranked as the most active stock on the Big Board. Lucent, the telecommunications equipment maker, which was battered by a weak outlook earlier this week, raised $1.75 billion by selling 15-year securities convertible into company stock.
Sprint lost 69 cents, to $15.23. Lehman Brothers said it was cutting its investment recommendation on Sprint to market perform from buy on concerns about weakness in its long-distance business.
Technology bellwethers like Sun Microsystems, down 27 cents at $9.21, weighed on the Nasdaq.
The No. 2 Internet equipment maker, Juniper Networks, slumped $1.46, to $11.50, after it was downgraded by ABN Amro.
International Paper gained 95 cents, to $44.27.
General Electric rose 41 cents, to $40.41, offering support to the Dow. Its finance arm sold $11 billion of global bonds, the second-largest bond sale ever by a United States company, locking in low financing costs before interest rates rise. --------------------

Treasury Prices Fall
(By Bloomberg News)
Treasury bond prices fell for the first day in four yesterday as traders bought corporate debt and government reports showed that jobless claims declined and business inventories rose. This heightened speculation the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates before the middle of the year.
"The recovery is under way, and the biggest loser in a rising rate market" is government debt, said Gary Pzegeo, who helps manage $4.5 billion in fixed-income assets at Gannett, Welsh & Kotler in Boston. He said he was buying corporate and mortgage-backed bonds, betting they would outperform Treasuries as economic growth picks up.
By late in the day, the 10-year note fell 1 2/32, to a price of 95 31/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, rose to 5.41 percent from 5.26 percent on Wednesday.
The 30-year bond also dropped sharply, losing 1 12/32, to a price of 93 21/32. Its yield rose to 5.83 percent from 5.73 percent.

HEADLINE: Hot Fight in Wisconsin Over University's Budget 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
A political battle over a yawning state budget deficit has left thousands of students, parents and professors in limbo as the University of Wisconsin froze undergraduate admissions and halted hiring in all but essential positions.
 The action by the Board of Regents came as state legislators increased proposed cuts in the budget of the 26-campus university system to $108 million, 12 percent of the state's allocation, from $51 million. The lawmakers were scrambling to fill a $1.1 billion shortfall in the state's $47 billion two-year budget. 
 Justyna Gaweda, a student hoping to enroll at the four-year campus in Oshkosh in the fall, said of the freeze on admissions, "It completely delays my plans." 
Ms. Gaweda, 26, a single mother from Appleton, Wis., will earn an associate degree this year.
"I've proven myself," she said. "I have my letters of recommendation; I have my grade-point average. And now they're telling me it's all for nothing. Why am I being punished?"
The university enrolls the equivalent of 130,000 full-time students across the system, and last year it admitted about 54,000 freshmen. So far, 45,600 students have been accepted this spring; 6,500 applications await processing.
The State Assembly's budget would cut 12 percent of the state's $880 million allocation to the university system, which has a total budget of $3.3 billion.
"We're going to have to make a decision to either decrease quality or decrease enrollment," said Jay L. Smith, president of the Board of Regents. "We don't want to do either."
While Wisconsin's problem is greater and the regents' approach to resolving it is drastic, similar struggles over financing higher education in the recent economic downturn are occurring in statehouses around the country.
At least eight states, including California and Florida, have trimmed spending for higher education in recent months, while others, including Massachusetts and Oklahoma, have cut financial aid or sports programs. These last-minute reductions come after state governments offered the smallest budget increases to higher education in five years this year, prompting tuition increases at public universities averaging 7.7 percent, the highest since 1993.
"There needs to be a real public debate about what percentage of the total cost of college should parents and students pay and should the taxpayer pay," said David Ward, president of the American Council on Education, a Washington group that represents the nation's 3,500 colleges and universities. "There's no agreement on that."
In Wisconsin, the battle began in January, when Gov. Scott McCallum produced his revised budget, chopping $375 million in aid to local governments and $216 million from state bureaucracies, along with $51 million from higher education, which university officials had accepted. Legislators restored the politically popular local government allocation, forcing deeper cuts elsewhere.
After an Assembly-Senate committee approved $22 million in further cuts to the university's appropriation last week, the regents announced on Friday that they would stop processing undergraduate applications, for fear of accepting a class that the system could not afford to educate. Outraged Assembly Republicans responded with $44 million more in cuts on Saturday; the angry regents voted on Wednesday to stop hiring.
The conflict has also reignited tension over a decision by the regents last fall to raise salaries for five top administrators -- increasing President Katharine Lyall's pay to $310,000, a $90,000 raise -- to bring their compensation into line with pay at competing university systems.
"They've playing very high stakes political cards," Governor McCallum said. "What I am trying to do is tone down the rhetoric so positions won't harden."
Ms. Lyall and Mr. Smith said they suspended admissions to give administrators a chance to assess the impact of the cuts. They are reluctant, they said, to reduce access to higher education, but refuse to return to the crowded campuses of the late 1980's, when students had to wait three semesters for required classes and attend 4 a.m. laboratories.
Senate Democrats have promised to restore the cuts, but Representative Stephen L. Nass, a Republican who is chairman of the Assembly's Education Committee, said the university "just doesn't get it that we're in a difficult fiscal time."
"They're getting into an intimidation game -- if you cut us, we'll do this -- no other department is doing that," Mr. Nass said. "By freezing freshman enrollments they are taking the easy way out. They should probably get some other managers in there who can deal with the problem."
Suzanne Schicantek of Milwaukee said her son Jason faced a summer of searching for minimum-wage jobs rather than registering for engineering classes.
"We understood it's like a map, and if you follow this path and do these things and don't turn here and don't turn here, you go this way," Ms. Schicantek said of the state's promise of affordable higher education. "All of a sudden, that way is blocked. You can't go from here to there anymore."

HEADLINE: The Stolen Election in Zimbabwe 

 BODY:
The election this week in Zimbabwe was an ugly travesty from which all of southern Africa will suffer. Voters lined up for hours at polling stations, many of them in vain. Supporters of the main opposition candidate were intimidated and beaten. Then the long-serving, increasingly tyrannical president, Robert Mugabe, was declared the winner. International observers called the process deeply flawed, and the Bush administration has refused to recognize the declared results. 
 Unfortunately, some leading African countries like South Africa and Nigeria have compounded the problem by appearing to accept Mr. Mugabe's victory despite earlier assertions that they would not recognize the results of a rigged election. By failing to hold firm they would not only damage their diplomatic credibility, but also ignore the consequences for nearby African states of Mr. Mugabe's misrule. These include explosive political frustration, a swelling tide of desperate refugees and a growing reluctance by foreign companies and donors to invest in the region. Washington and other Western governments may now strengthen the current mild sanctions against Zimbabwe. These steps would be far more effective if they were joined by major African states. 
 Mr. Mugabe, who led Zimbabwe's liberation struggle against white minority rule, has systematically wrecked his country's economy and its freedoms to prolong his 22-year-old hold on power. Zimbabwe should be an economic beacon, not a basket case. It is blessed with fertile agricultural land, and during the first dozen years of Mr. Mugabe's rule it was relatively prosperous and free. 
That picture changed radically in the mid-1990's when Mr. Mugabe shifted onto a highly destructive course. He incited violent land seizures that have taken a disastrous toll on agricultural investment and production and launched a broad assault on journalistic freedom and judicial independence. This campaign has been carried out with help from a small but loyal core of former liberation fighters turned thugs. 
Thugs and fraud cannot keep the 78-year-old Mr. Mugabe in power forever. Zimbabwe's recovery will have to wait for his departure.

PERSON: Thomas Winship 

HEADLINE: Thomas Winship, Ex-Editor of Boston Globe, Dies at 81 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Thomas Winship, who as editor of The Boston Globe for two decades propelled the newspaper to regional leadership and national stature, in part through tireless coverage of the court-ordered school busing that split the city in the 1970's, died yesterday in Boston. He was 81 and lived in Lincoln, Mass.
 He had been under care for lymphoma at Massachusetts General Hospital, said his son Laurence. 
 Mr. Winship, who started out as a reporter in Washington, grew up in a newspaper family. His grandfather A. E. Winship had been editor of The Boston Traveller. His father, Laurence, joined The Globe in 1911 as a reporter and was named editor in 1955. Thomas Winship succeeded him in 1965 and by his retirement in 1984 built The Globe's circulation and prestige in a period of often disruptive economic and social change. At the height of the busing dispute, bullets flew through The Globe's newsroom windows. 
Mr. Winship made The Globe the third newspaper, after The New York Times and The Washington Post, to defy government secrecy and publish the Pentagon papers on the Vietnam War. His staff covered the school busing crisis with such voluminous and balanced reporting that it was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1975. The paper won 12 Pulitzer Prizes under his leadership.
Mr. Winship fit the mold of the crusading big-city editor, a position made easier because, until 1981, he directed both the news and editorial pages, roles that are usually separate at major newspapers. The Globe was the second major newspaper, after The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, to call for American withdrawal from Vietnam.
Often, in the view of critics and admirers, Mr. Winship's advocacy was apparent not just in editorials but in the news pages. For example, when The Globe campaigned for handgun control and a bottle-redemption bill, Time magazine said, the newspaper ran hundreds of articles that argued for its views.
In "Common Ground," by J. Anthony Lukas (Knopf 1985), a pain staking examination of the way court-ordered racial integration affected three Boston families, Mr. Winship was quoted as calling traditional journalistic objectivity "a code word for playing it safe."
Mr. Winship did not shrink from pursuing stories wherever they went. He said his most painful decision was to publish an investigation of the finances of the liberal Republican Edward W. Brooke, the first black United States senator since Reconstruction. The inquiry contributed greatly to Senator Brooke's defeat in 1978.
Mr. Winship believed that quality journalism was good business, and he proved it, expanding The Globe's coverage of sports, science and the arts. When he began, there were five newspapers in Boston and The Globe was just beginning to pull ahead of The Boston Herald in circulation. In his tenure The Globe's daily circulation rose by 40 percent, to 520,000, and Sunday circulation by 50 percent, to 792,786. The newspaper became dominant, though some purists worried that its focus had become more suburban as its circulation crept ever outward. 
In the newsroom, in the corridors of Harvard and at the journalism conventions he loved to attend, Mr. Winship's casual flamboyance -- reflected in flowered bow ties, red suspenders and the battered pickup truck he drove to work -- was reinforced by the breezy affability of an Irish politician.
"Whadya say, pal? Howya doing?" he would call to colleagues.
With his own sense of style, this WASP scion (though not a Boston Brahmin) worked to bridge the gap between The Globe and its readers. 
Thomas Winship was born in Cambridge, Mass., on July 1, 1920. Soon after, his family moved to Sudbury, a farming community 16 miles west of Boston. His family was of modest means, and his early education was unusual.
The industrialist Henry Ford had discovered a one-room schoolhouse linked by legend to the story of Mary and her little lamb. He installed it on a Sudbury hillside and furnished it with 19th-century desks and a potbellied stove. He then recruited a teacher and 16 local children, Tom Winship among them.
When Mr. Ford produced a movie about Mary and the lamb, Tom's job was to hide the animal under his desk until the director was ready for it.
Mr. Winship followed his father to Harvard, where he founded the ski club and met Elizabeth Coolidge, who became his wife. She survives him, as do a sister, Joanna Crawford of Lincoln, Mass.; two sons, Laurence, of Minneapolis, and Benjamin, of Victor, Idaho; two daughters, Margaret, of Eagle Bridge, N.Y., and Joanna, of Minneapolis; and eight grandchildren.
After graduating from Harvard in 1942, Mr. Winship took laboring jobs and then joined the Coast Guard. He served as a combat correspondent aboard a troop ship on D-Day. After the war, while working at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington, he got a night job writing obituaries for The Washington Post. He continued at the paper, covering the police, after his discharge.
He considered himself apolitical and said he was surprised when Senator Leverett Saltonstall, a Massachusetts Republican, offered him a job as press secretary. The experience awakened a political streak in the young man, who became a Democrat. He said he thought Republicans were too negative.
Mr. Winship returned to The Post for six years, then joined The Globe as its Washington correspondent. He returned to Boston in 1958 to be metropolitan editor, then managing editor.
He was in charge when The Globe broke the news that Senator Edward M. Kennedy had cheated on a test as a Harvard undergraduate. Later, as executive editor, he published a series of articles on the senator's auto accident at Chappaquiddick that Mr. Kennedy called "ugly, untrue and grossly unfair."
Yesterday, Mr. Kennedy said in a statement that Mr. Winship "was truly the hallmark of what a newspaper editor should be."
Succeeding his father in 1965, he immediately defined himself as his own man by taking on the remnants of McCarthyism, decaying neighborhoods and racial segregation, subjects on which his father on which his father's Globe had often declined to comment. The Globe won its first Pulitzer Prize for articles on the unsuitability for the federal bench of Francis X. Morrissey, a Kennedy family retainer.
Mr. Winship broke more new ground by banning advertisements from the front page and eliminating the signature "Uncle Dudley" from editorials, which had been a folksy tradition at The Globe. The newspaper also made its first political endorsement in 72 years, for Kevin H. White over Louise Day Hicks, a school board member and busing opponent, in the 1967 mayoral race. He signed up columnists like Ellen Goodman and Peter Gammons, the baseball writer.
After his retirement from The Globe, he was the first senior fellow at the Gannett Center for Media Studies (now the Freedom Forum) and the founding chairman of the Center for Foreign Journalists, a nonprofit institute offering seminars for Third World journalists.
Two decades after the swirling, violent fight over integrating Boston schools, Mr. Winship said his biggest disappointment in journalism was not suggesting more nuanced approaches. But he said he still believed that his support for integration was absolutely right.

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE ADVISER; 
Volcker Stays at Work But Fears His Efforts Might Go for Naught

BYLINE:  By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
Paul A. Volcker, who loves a metaphor, has been referring to himself lately as Don Quixote. That is quite a contrast from the confidence he exuded when he took on the task last month of improving the accounting profession by using Arthur Andersen, desperate to overcome the stain of Enron, as his platform. 
 Now with Andersen at risk of collapsing, Mr. Volcker fears that he may be tilting at windmills. 
 "I had hoped that Andersen would become a model for reforming the profession," he said. "It was a dream, like Don Quixote. Still, trying to bring change does make the blood run."
For Mr. Volcker, who is 75, this late-in-life stab at lifting the standards of accountants, and of corporate America in general, offered him his best opportunity since his days as Federal Reserve chairman to play a substantial role in public life. Instead, he finds that the auditing firm that he had hoped to cleanse is at risk of disappearing, depriving him of an opportunity to add to his legacy.
Not that Mr. Volcker intends to quit. With much fanfare, he announced the appointment in late February of an independent oversight board -- himself and two other prominent men -- to oversee the changes at Andersen. In its quest for survival, the accounting firm gave Mr. Volcker carte blanche to make changes -- the hope being that a seal of approval from the man who tamed inflation in the late 1970's and early 1980's might make a reorganized Andersen viable again.
But then, Andersen's executives tried to negotiate a merger with another firm. With the rug seeming to disappear from under them, Mr. Volcker and his board members -- Charles A. Bowsher, a former comptroller general of the United States, and Dr. P. Roy Vagelos, retired chairman and chief executive of Merck & Company -- met on Wednesday to discuss what to do. 
They were joined by William C. Mutterperl, a former general counsel at the FleetBoston Financial Corporation, who had been hired as executive director of the oversight board.
The four decided, Mr. Volcker said, that even if Andersen disappeared, they would continue their efforts, although the board's expenses, which Andersen had agreed to pay, might be hard to finance elsewhere. Andersen's demise would be "a setback for reform," he said, "but a group of very prominent people want to stick together and push for reform."
The merger talk faded yesterday and the odds increased that Andersen might continue, at least for the time being -- indicted on felony charges, to be sure, and perhaps under bankruptcy protection, but still an independent accounting firm. If that happened, would Mr. Volcker get back his platform for reform? "That depends on the circumstances," he said.
With Andersen as his club, Mr. Volcker had hoped to force the other four large accounting firms to raise their standards also. He had opposed the decision by the Justice Department to indict Andersen, arguing that the firm might then disintegrate.
That would leave the four other firms, he said, free to pursue their old, flawed ways. Without an Andersen marching to Mr. Volcker's standards, the others would lobby to water down any reforms that Congress might consider as a result of Andersen's role as Enron's auditor.
"There may be some legislation for an oversight body," Mr. Volcker said, "but you need an oversight body with teeth."
Mr. Volcker and his colleagues had originally allotted 18 months to change Andersen, making it once again the gold standard for the profession, as Mr. Volcker put it. Mr. Bowsher was not even scheduled to join the oversight board until March 30, when he completed another commitment.
But with Andersen's prospects rapidly deteriorating, Mr. Volcker and his fellow board members hastily put together a set of proposals, which they announced at a news conference on Monday. 
Those proposals now become the charter for Mr. Volcker's continuing efforts to change the accounting industry. The rules would require accounting firms to separate their auditing and consulting practices, ridding themselves of consulting, which has become a huge source of income in recent years. 
The rise in consulting income from companies like Enron, Mr. Volcker argues, has been an incentive for accountants to be lax in auditing a client's books.
The proposals also called for Andersen, and by extension other accounting firms, to create a group of senior partners that would have "unambiguous authority over new and difficult interpretations of accepted accounting practices." Such a body presumably would have ruled against the decision of Andersen's auditors in Houston to allow the off-the-book partnerships that played so big a role in bringing down Enron.
Mr. Volcker, who drafted the proposals, would no longer allow partners to audit the same client's books for more than five years. 
He would insist on a "suitable cooling-off period" before partners of accounting firms could accept jobs at companies they had audited. And accounting firms would agree to the creation of permanent, independent oversight boards that would review, at least once a year, "the quality and independence of audits."
"My interest remains in supporting reform as the opportunities arise," Mr. Volcker said. "That is about all you can say."

HEADLINE: Slimmed Down and Hopeful; 
Moe Ginsburg Men's Store Bets on an Upturn

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
Until their third-generation men's clothing store in Manhattan's Flatiron district began to fail, the owners of Moe Ginsburg had never borrowed money from a bank, not even to finance a $1.5 million renovation in 1998.
 By the fall of 2000, however, the Manhattan retailer, known for selling men's designer suits at discount prices, was having difficulty paying its vendors, and by the following May, it had filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. A company that once sold more than 40,000 suits a year and had $20 million in sales suddenly owed its creditors $2.5 million. 
 Watching his family business sink was a humiliating experience for Paul Ginsburg, 48, who has run the store on Fifth Avenue and 21st Street that he and his two sisters inherited from their father, Moe, since 1992. "We are old-fashioned people," said Mr. Ginsburg, a tall man with a linebacker's build who was wearing a $1,500 Canali suit. "For us, the notion of declaring bankruptcy had all the bad connotations." 
Worst of all, Mr. Ginsburg said, he had to trim a work force that once numbered 85 employees to 25. 
No one keeps track of what happens to small businesses that find themselves in Moe Ginsburg's situation. But in most cases, bankruptcy experts say, a Chapter 11 filing is usually only the first step on the road to a Chapter 7 liquidation. For one thing, the bankruptcy process is itself expensive, with consultants and lawyers charging several hundred dollars an hour for their advice.
Jay R. Indyke, the lawyer representing Moe Ginsburg's creditors committee (made up of its seven largest creditors), estimates that 80 percent of these drowning businesses go under, and that even companies that manage to develop a reorganization plan are usually unable to carry it through.
But unlike most companies that seek bankruptcy protection, Moe Ginsburg is given good odds of surviving under Mr. Ginsburg's management. The company and its leading creditors recently worked out a reorganization plan. On Tuesday, Judge Robert Gerber of United States Bankruptcy Court authorized the company to seek approval of the proposal from the company's other creditors. A confirmation hearing is scheduled for May 8.
Bankruptcy experts say the reorganization plan has several encouraging elements: concessions made by the union that represents Moe Ginsburg's remaining employees, Mr. Ginsburg's willingness to listen to outside advice and make substantial changes in his operations and the family's willingness to put up its own money to partly repay creditors. Cooperation among the major parties in a bankruptcy proceeding is rare, said Peter Tourtellot, chairman of the Turnaround Management Association, a trade group of bankruptcy professionals.
"If they were able to get cooperation from all of the stakeholders, that is unusual," said Mr. Tourtellot, who is not involved in the Moe Ginsburg case. "If there's any chance for this company to make it, you need that cooperation -- the creditors, the union and everyone else stepping up to the plate -- to make this happen. I'd be very encouraged."
Since the 1970's, Moe Ginsburg workers have been represented by the Retail Employees Union Local 340, a part of the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. The membership of Local 340, which also represents other men's retailers, like Paul Stuart and J. Press, has decreased over the years, to 1,000 members from 3,000, with the death of stores like Bond's, F. R. Tripler and Wallachs.
Under the previous collective bargaining agreement, Moe Ginsburg employees worked six days a week, with eight hours of guaranteed overtime. The new agreement cuts the workweek and provides that the bulk of a salesman's earnings will come from commissions rather than salary, an arrangement that is not uncommon in retailing. 
Ernie Rosenberg, the secretary-treasurer of the local, said the sales force was happy to go along with the changes. "They understood that the important thing was to save their jobs," he said. Most of the employees have been with the company for at least 20 years.
The casual-clothes trend in the business world and the downturn in the economy, which has hurt many retailers, were just two of the reasons Moe Ginsburg got into trouble. 
For several years, the company, founded a half-century ago in the East New York section of Brooklyn by Paul Ginsburg's grandfather, who was a manufacturer as a well as a retailer, had been facing increased competition from chain stores like Men's Wearhouse and Today's Man on the nearby Avenue of the Americas. Fancier stores like Bergdorf Goodman and Saks were also luring away customers with deep markdowns.
In 1998, Mr. Ginsburg undertook a costly makeover, replacing the concrete walls on the European designer floor with cherry and walnut paneling and introducing luxury labels like Joseph Abboud and Hugo Boss to meet the demands of some of his customers. "Some of our longtime customers wanted to trade up," Mr. Ginsburg said. But he said the move may have driven away other, more price-conscious shoppers.
To get the company back on its feet, the creditors' committee insisted on harsh medicine. "We're concerned when there's a family business," Mr. Indyke said, "especially when it's second or third generation. What are they relying on for merchandising and marketing expertise? Usually, it's all in-house." 
Mr. Ginsburg was willing to bring in the retail consultant recommended by the committee, the Buxbaum Group, of Encino, Calif. "This was not easy," said Mr. Ginsburg, who joined the business when he graduated from Brooklyn College in 1974. At Buxbaum's suggestion, Mr. Ginsburg agreed to sublease three floors of selling space and confine his store to the fifth and sixth floors. (This should not hurt the store, said Paul M. Buxbaum, the Buxbaum Group's chief executive, since it never had ground-floor space and is considered a "destination retailer," rather than one that depends on walk-in business.)
He also agreed to eliminate his shoe department, a costly investment because it has to carry a wide range of styles and sizes; cut back his vendors to about 75 from 250, and sell suits priced at $300 to $800.
Mr. Buxbaum said that, unlike women, male customers often become disoriented when they are offered too many choices. "He tried to be all things to everyone," Mr. Buxbaum said.
Mr. Ginsburg, who has taken up smoking again after quitting for eight years, said he knew that it would not be easy to succeed in the current economic climate. But he said he drew strength from his creditors' willingness to give him a second chance. "Most independent store owners are an endangered species," Mr. Ginsburg said. "We hope to buck this trend."

HEADLINE: City's Deficit Forces Police To Study Cuts in Overtime 

BYLINE:  By KEVIN FLYNN 

 BODY:
The city's fiscal crisis is forcing the Police Department to reduce overtime spending in programs that the Giuliani administration once described as essential to reducing crime. But Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said yesterday that even with the cuts, the force would be able to police the city effectively.
 Mr. Kelly has appointed a panel to begin reviewing ways to cut police overtime, which has more than doubled in the last three years. Some of the reductions that have already taken shape are in overtime programs specifically created to cut crime. 
 For example, Operation Condor, a program that pays officers to work a sixth day in a week, has been allotted $39.7 million for the fiscal year that begins in July, down from the $100 million spent in the fiscal year that ended last June and the $62 million appropriated this year.
Over all, the police overtime budget for the coming fiscal year has been set at $177 million, which is only half what the agency spent in the fiscal year that ended last June and less than a third of what it expects to spend in the current fiscal year, during which the World Trade Center attack sent overtime soaring.
Mr. Kelly said the reductions were necessary to help the city close a $4.76 billion budget gap and would not cause problems as long as the available funds were spent wisely. Police officials have noted that crime is down 7 percent this year, even though spending on the Condor program has been sharply reduced.
"I'm confident that with the hard work and dedication of the men and women of this department, we will continue to keep crime down," Mr. Kelly said.
But the cuts represent an abrupt shift from the direction taken by the Giuliani administration and may affect the department in ways that extend beyond the shrinking take-home pay of officers.
The Giuliani administration, flush with tax revenues from a booming economy, greatly increased overtime spending and did so without apology. Indeed, with the Condor program, administration officials refashioned overtime, a spending category often associated with sloppy management, into a strategic tool that they used to put many more officers on patrol.
For example, during the fiscal year that ended last June, officers working Condor overtime shifts made some 71,000 arrests, or nearly 20 percent of all arrests, according to department statistics.
"We think that without Condor it would be very, very difficult to continue reducing crime," Joseph P. Dunne, the first deputy police commissioner at the time, said after arguing for more funds for the program at a budget hearing in November 2000.
But several analysts and police commanders said that, as the years passed, the police overtime budget became bloated and it could now be reduced. To that end, Mr. Kelly recently told a meeting of police commanders that they must re-emphasize to officers that arrests should be made during regular working hours whenever possible.
Nonetheless, as overtime recedes, the pressure on the department to give officers a substantial raise will most likely intensify, said John F. Timoney, a former first deputy police commissioner. Mr. Timoney is among those who believe overtime costs have risen too much. But he said the ample overtime of recent years had worked to soften the anger of many officers who say their salaries are too low. Entry-level base pay for officers is $31,305 a year.
"You are really striking up a social contract," Mr. Timoney said, "and it goes something like, 'We expect you to produce and we don't have the overtime to give away anymore, and so we are going to give you a livable wage.' If any part of that falls down, it all falls down."
Jerome Skolnick, a professor at New York University School of Law who studies the police, said some complaining by officers was to be expected. But, he said, "I think the average New York cop understands that we have had a recession and a terror attack and that we can't judge ourselves according to the standards set in the financial boom days of the 90's."
Mr. Kelly said the mission of his new overtime panel is to review issues such as whether the department is overstaffing events. Overtime to patrol planned celebrations like parades, as well as unforeseeable events like labor strikes, has doubled in the last three years, according to department statistics.
If police officials reduce overtime, it would be the first time in eight years that such spending has declined. In fact, during the current fiscal year, police officials project that overtime will reach $560 million, although $295 million of that was spent in response to the terrorist attacks and those costs will be largely reimbursed by the federal government.
Police overtime has increased even though the force of 39,000 officers is much larger than it was 10 years ago. This seeming incongruity often led Sheldon Leffler, when he was chairman of the City Council's Public Safety Committee, to question whether the force could not be more efficiently deployed. But police officials have said that much of the growth in overtime stemmed from the merger of the housing and transit police forces into the Police Department. They also said that additional officers produced additional arrests, many of which required officers on overtime to take suspects through the criminal justice system.
The sharpest rise in overtime began two years ago when the Police Department unveiled Operation Condor. 
The program puts as many as 1,000 officers a day on overtime patrol, although some analysts have said that the resulting arrests have too often been for minor offenses.
Mr. Kelly said some commanders were concerned that some officers may be holding back on arrests until their Condor overtime shift so that they will appear productive, and thus be picked for additional overtime assignments. To combat that, he said, precincts and other commands are being questioned closely about the percentage of the arrests that officers are making on overtime versus regular working hours.
Despite the efforts by police supervisors, both city and state auditors predicted this week that the police will spend $100 million more on overtime in fiscal 2003 than the budgeted amount of $177 million. Such skepticism is buttressed by the department's overtime tally for January of $42 million, an unusually high amount that police officials said was caused in part by the cost of policing the World Economic Forum, which drew thousands of demonstrators to the city.
Several other analysts said, however, that they do not view the proposed reductions as unreasonable.
"Getting overtime down to around $175 million or $200 million, which is twice what it used to be, is eminently doable," said Michael Jacobson, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "It was a conscious policy to drive overtime up, so there's no mystery here. If they want to get it down, they just have to make choices."

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe Moderate Offers Assurances to Opposition 

BYLINE:  By RACHEL L. SWARNS 

DATELINE: HARARE, Zimbabwe, March 14 

 BODY:
Jubilant throngs danced through the streets, clapping, whistling and singing their throats sore. They cheered for President Robert Mugabe, who was declared the winner of the presidential election this week, and praised his promises for a better life.
 But as the crowds were celebrating today, hundreds of hungry people here in the capital were lining up for rations of cornmeal in this era of food shortages. And John Nkomo, the home affairs minister, arrived at his office with few illusions about the enormous difficulties that lay ahead. 
 "The next few months are going to be quite challenging and demanding on everybody," Mr. Nkomo said in an interview. "Our success is assured only if everybody says, 'Fine, we've had an election. The verdict has been pronounced. Now let's get going together.' " The United States and Britain have assailed the election as illegitimate and threaten to toughen sanctions against the government's top leaders.
Western officials, who have already cut off most aid to Zimbabwe, have vowed to keep their pocketbooks shut. Tourism and foreign investment is drying up here and hunger is spreading across the country.
Some donors had promised to extend foreign aid to an opposition government but not to Mr. Mugabe, who condoned political violence during his campaign as well as the seizures of white-owned farms. So in the short term, officials say, Mr. Mugabe's re-election will likely mean continuing hardship for this struggling country.
Mr. Nkomo said the government wanted to attract foreign investors and to improve Zimbabwe's image and relations with the West. Another priority, he said, was reconciling the polarized nation by reassuring white farmers and black opposition supporters of their place in the country.
"They are Zimbabweans and we are Zimbabweans," Mr. Nkomo said of the white farmers and opposition supporters. "We have to resolve our differences and work together."
Mr. Nkomo is one of the moderates in Mr. Mugabe's cabinet and it is difficult to assess whether the hard-liners in government have signed on to such a course of action. But with the election over, some diplomats here believe that the government will try to woo the West by cracking down on illegal farm occupations and political violence and implementing some economic reforms.
Zimbabwe, which was once one of Africa's most prosperous countries, has been run by Mr. Mugabe since white rule ended in 1980. But in the last decade, the poverty rate has surged to 75 percent from 40 percent, the United Nations says.
Today, the economy is contracting, inflation has soared to more than 100 percent and nearly a half a million people need emergency food aid. Hundreds of companies have closed and more than 10,000 jobs have been lost over the last two years.
In the poor suburbs of Harare, where market women sell used clothing and sugar cane, many families struggle to afford two meals a day.
Onias Dendere, a 42-year-old welder, predicted that times will get harder because Zimbabwe will receive little help from wealthy nations that view the country as a pariah state.
"We are going to face the toughest times now," said Mr. Dendere, who set up a rusty sign on a street corner to offer his services to the public. He says he has not had a single customer in four months.
"I'm a father of six children, living in a two-room house that I am renting and I have no business at all," said Mr. Dendere, a lean man in a tattered T-shirt and fraying trousers.
In the heart of the capital, civil servants with leather briefcases and housewives with restless toddlers wait in lines that stretch for blocks outside local supermarkets, hoping for the arrival of scarce items like sugar and cooking oil.
Most people here are supporters of Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader, who promised to mend fences with the West and to ease the economic crisis.
Today several people said they believed that the election had been rigged. They said it was only the fear of a government crackdown that was preventing people from demonstrating their outrage.
"We are quiet because we know they can bring in the army," said Easyway Gumbo, a 34-year-old beer salesman. "But people are bitter. We've got factories and industries closing their doors. People are going without adequate meals. If things don't get better, most likely things will boil."

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY/International; 
The Big 3 Sit and Honk Outside Korea's Garage

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM J. HOLSTEIN 

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea 

 BODY:
JAE H. JUNG doesn't look like a global warrior as he edges his black Lincoln LS sedan through the crush of midday traffic. But as the recently appointed president of the Ford Motor Company's Korean sales operation, Mr. Jung is storming the ramparts of a market in which 1.4 million cars were sold last year -- and in which Ford sold just 400.
 As he seeks to expand that nearly infinitesimal market share, he faces not only fierce cultural resistance to foreign cars, but complex import duties and ever-shifting safety and emission standards. "It's a tough challenge," said Mr. Jung, 42. "But I like it." 
 His challenges do not, at least, include the Korean economy, which is growing again after several years of pain. So is its auto market, which remains one of the world's most robust, surging 48 percent in January, compared with the month a year earlier, and 11 percent last month, according to J. D. Power & Associates. The Hyundai Motor Company, the largest Korean automaker by far, is making record profits. 
But this is also the most closed car market of any major auto-producing nation, with foreign manufacturers accounting for less than 1 percent of sales. American brands are losing some of their minuscule share to the Europeans. Meanwhile, Hyundai, Kia (which Hyundai acquired about three years ago) and Daewoo have grabbed about 4 percent of the American market.
"Autos are by far the most difficult and complicated issue we have with the Koreans," said Jeffrey D. Jones, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea.
This market is particularly appealing now because Koreans' cars are getting old: an average of 5.5 years last year, compared with 3.5 years in 1996. Because of the economic crisis of 1997-98, Koreans didn't buy many cars, and the streets are filled with clunkers. The government says sales of foreign vehicles nearly doubled last year, but only to 7,700, or 0.5 percent of the market.
Korean automakers and the government say they have opened the market to imports. No longer do tax authorities automatically audit Koreans who buy foreign cars, as was once the case. And the government recently agreed to pull back from adopting European side-impact safety standards that would have created complications for American companies that send cars here.
It is not clear whether those moves will be enough to head off an international trade fight. Ford has been particularly active in pressing for a more open market, working with the United States trade representative's office to roll back Korea's maze of safety and emission rules. In an interview at the Detroit auto show in January, Nicholas V. Scheele, the chief operating officer of Ford, said he found the imbalance between the American and Korean car markets "amazing." Asked whether he thought recent moves had truly opened up Korea, Mr. Scheele said, "No, I don't."
For more than a year, General Motors has been seeking to acquire factories belonging to Daewoo Motors, which is still making cars while in bankruptcy proceedings. Officials in the American auto industry say G.M. may be close to signing a complex deal involving 16 specific agreements on topics like how it will deal with unions.
If G.M. prevails, some Korean commentators like Mun Kun Cheong, senior vice president of the Samsung Economic Research Institute, say foreign manufacturers could eventually capture 30 percent of Korea's market. But foreign auto executives say that seems unlikely anytime soon. Mr. Jones of the Chamber of Commerce said the issue could be largely resolved if foreigners' market share simply rose to 5 percent.
Even if G.M. acquires local manufacturing assets from Daewoo, foreign executives here argue that it will face a hostile unionized work force and other stumbling blocks, like liabilities hidden in other parts of the collapsed Daewoo group. Other American companies, including Micron Technology and AIG Insurance, have recently had difficulty acquiring Korean operations.
Standing in a Ford showroom in Kang Nam, a section of southern Seoul that has become quite affluent, Mr. Jung said there were three big impediments to selling American cars here. One is that emission and safety standards keep shifting. Although the government has backed down on side impacts, other rules continue to change.
A second barrier is a customs duty based on engine displacement. That usually amounts to about 8 percent for his vehicles. That duty is compounded by additional taxes and results in a 15 percent increase in the retail price of each vehicle. (Ford's best seller here is the small Escape sport utility, followed by the Taurus and the Mondeo, which is made by Ford of Europe.)
Finally, he said that even though tax authorities no longer routinely single out buyers of foreign cars for unwelcome attention, Koreans are still intensely nationalistic and think poorly of foreign cars. But atttitudes are slowly shifting, said Mr. Jung, a Korean who received an M.B.A. at the University of Pittsburgh. "Acceptance is growing."
Korean manufacturers and the government argue that American automakers simply do not offer the right products. Gasoline, heavily taxed, costs $4 a gallon, so Koreans at the low end of the market prefer small engines. Yet they also like size, which implies not just status, but safety. Some 10,000 Koreans were killed in auto accidents last year, giving this nation of 47 million a higher fatality rate than the United States.
So Korean manufacturers make sedans that Americans would consider underpowered, and foreign automakers have to cope with a currency exchange rate that makes their products more expensive. "If foreign manufacturers want to increase their sales, they need to introduce more smaller cars and multipurpose vehicles that Koreans can afford to buy," said Dong Wha Lee, executive director of the Korean Automobile Manufacturers Association. Koreans call sport utilities "multipurpose vehicles."
There are other variations based on Korean preferences. At the high end of the market, Korean men want to be chauffered. That means they care more about the controls and creature comforts in the back seat than those in front. Mercedes-Benz has figured that out, making it the most popular foreign brand among affluent men.
Women, however, prefer BMW's. BMW is, in fact, the largest foreign brand at the moment. But BMW's are not selling here because of their performance image -- Korean roads are usually too jammed for aggressive driving. Instead, Koreans say women are reassured by the number of air bags in a BMW (as many as eight). BMW also goes to great lengths to promise roadside assistance anywhere in the country if a car breaks down. American automakers do not offer such services.
The government takes a tough line. It is not trade barriers that hurt Detroit, but its mix of models and prices, said Sang Ki Park, director general of the Bilateral Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade. American companies "should think twice about why they're not competitive," he said in an interview.
At the end of the day, Mr. Jones of the American Chamber of Commerce said, cultural barriers are still the strongest factor limiting foreign car sales. The social hierarchies inside big Korean companies keep those in the ranks from buying foreign goods if their bosses don't own them, too. "If a director has a foreign car and if the managing director is driving around in a domestic car, it's just not possible," Mr. Jones said. "The director will be subject to all sorts of pressure."
Mr. Jones, who has sought to serve as a broker for auto talks between the nations, said he worried that discontent with South Korea could erupt in Washington, particularly as American auto factories are closed. It will be important, he said, to see if Hyundai proceeds with its plan to build an American plant. Hyundai said recently that it had narrowed the possible sites for a plant to Montgomery, Ala., and Glendale, Ky.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Profits Fall 13% at Oracle, And It Blames the Economy

BYLINE:  By MATT RICHTEL 

 BODY:
Asserting that the technology sector is not yet seeing signs of recovery, the Oracle Corporation reported today that its sales were continuing to slide, though the company did meet its own lowered projections for its quarter.
 But the company's explanation that macroeconomic forces are largely to blame for the continued weakness was met with skepticism from some Oracle analysts and investors. The critics said that Oracle was suffering more from competitive pressures than it admits, and is feeling the impact of several management departures. 
 Jeffrey O. Henley, the chief financial officer of Oracle, which makes powerful databases and applications like software used to oversee manufacturing, said macroeconomic factors were "80 to 85" percent responsible for the drop in its software licensing revenue. Over all, licensing for software was down 30 percent compared with a year earlier; in Oracle's second quarter ended Nov. 30, licensing had been down 27 percent from a year earlier. 
Mr. Henley said he expected that growth of software licensing for Oracle's current quarter, its fourth, would be down 25 percent to 30 percent compared with a year earlier.
Overall revenue for the third quarter ended Feb. 28 was $2.23 billion, down from $2.67 billion a year ago. Earnings fell 13 percent, to $508 million, or 9 cents a share. The company, based in Redwood City, Calif., initially projected earnings would be 10 cents a share, but on March 1 amended estimates to 9 cents. Earnings a year earlier were $582.7 million, or 10 cents a share.
Last quarter was the fifth consecutive one that Oracle has announced that earnings would not meet its own initial projections.
In the previous four quarters, Oracle said that the dot-com collapse was a large factor in the downturn. But Mr. Henley acknowledged that Oracle cannot continue to use the Internet boom as a basis for comparison, given that it has been more than a year since the height of exorbitant dot-com-led spending.
"The dot-com comparison went away this quarter and yet we still did pretty badly," he said, arguing that the company instead is seeing "more fall-off" in other sectors, notably telecommunications. "Customers aren't doing big deals," he said. "They aren't sure their businesses are going to grow."
To be sure, the quarterly returns come at a difficult time for the software industry. It has been hit both by a drop in corporate technology investments, spurred by the recession, as well as delays of new software purchases by companies that have found themselves with more software than they need.
But some industry analysts question whether Oracle is feeling acute pressure in its database business because I.B.M. and Microsoft have increased their efforts. Meanwhile, with the applications business maturing, products from various competitors are looking similar, making it tough for Oracle to differentiate itself, said Eric B. Upin, a senior software analyst with Robertson Stephens.
In applications, Mr. Henley said the company "did lose some momentum."
Mr. Upin said one indication that Oracle's struggles are internal, and not macroeconomic, is that its competitors have recently announced relatively stronger results.
"You look at the big sumo wrestlers in the ring and they had numbers in line with or slightly above Wall Street estimates," said Mr. Upin, who said he was referring to SAP of Germany and PeopleSoft, among others. He added that "they had positive comments" about coming quarters.
In addition, Mr. Upin said he was concerned about the impact of the departures of several Oracle executives, including Raymond J. Lane, the chief operating officer, and Gary L. Bloom, an executive vice president, who left in 2000. Edward J. Sanderson Jr., another executive vice president, left last summer.
Rumors have circulated, too, that Mr. Henley could go. But the chief financial officer dismissed the suggestion. "I don't have any plans to leave," he said. "If I had any plans to leave, would I be working this hard?"

HEADLINE: ENRON'S MANY STRANDS: THE INVESTIGATION; 
ANDERSEN CHARGED WITH OBSTRUCTION IN ENRON INQUIRY

BYLINE:  By KURT EICHENWALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14 

 BODY:
In the first criminal charge ever brought against a major accounting firm, Arthur Andersen has been indicted on a single count of obstruction of justice for destroying thousands of documents related to the Enron investigation, the Justice Department announced today. 
 The indictment, handed up by a grand jury last week and unsealed today, describes a concerted effort by Andersen to shred records related to Enron in four of the firm's offices, in Houston, Chicago, London and Portland, Ore. It was the first criminal charge stemming from the government's investigation of Enron's collapse in December. 
 "Obstruction of justice is a grave matter, and one that this department takes very seriously," Larry D. Thompson, deputy attorney general, said at the Justice Department. "Arthur Andersen is charged with a crime that attacks the justice system itself by impeding investigators and regulators from getting at the truth." 
Andersen, quickly signaling that it would contest the charge vehemently, denied that it had committed any crime and criticized the government for what it called an extraordinary abuse of prosecutorial discretion without precedent. News analysis, Page C1. 
"A criminal prosecution against the entire firm for obstruction of justice is both factually and legally baseless," the firm said in a statement.
Andersen, struggling to survive in some form, was still trying today to reach a deal to sell pieces of its business to KPMG, another top accounting firm. But the chances of a deal were said to be remote. 
By tonight, the Securities and Exchange Commission took several emergency measures to minimize the fallout from the Andersen indictment. Andersen, one of the Big Five accounting firms, provides auditing services to almost 20 percent of the publicly traded companies in the United States.
The S.E.C. ruled that any Andersen's client who chose to abandon the firm could file unaudited financial statements, with audited records due 60 days later. Government officials do not expect that option to be used frequently, though, because the delivery of unaudited financial statements could unnerve investors.
The S.E.C. appeared to be concerned that some Andersen partners might abandon the firm, or that foreign offices might split off. Under the new S.E.C. rulings, companies whose audits Andersen completes after today must receive the firm's assurances about quality and controls, including promises that the employees involved will continue to be available. 
The indictment -- against the entire firm, rather than individuals -- comes at a critical time in Andersen's campaign for survival. Within the firm, splits have started to emerge among partners, according to people close to the internal discussions. Though many partners want to combat the government, others suggest that the firm should simply disband, eliminating the government's ability to go to trial.
But there are strong signs that the firm is preparing to travel down two tracks -- maintaining its business while fighting the criminal case and other legal problems stemming from its Enron work. The firm was notified today that a small group of senior partners would temporarily assume responsibility for many of Andersen's operations, while management continues to deal with the legal problems.
Nevertheless, Andersen fully expects the American operation to shrink in the coming weeks and months, as the economic pressures brought on by the unfolding scandal grow. "We are looking at a significant hit to the business," said Charles Leonard, a spokesman for Andersen. 
Lawyers for the firm, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they were moving quickly to dismiss the indictment, attacking both its legal and factual accuracy. They also said they planned to compel prosecutors to identify which Andersen partners acted with the criminal intent that, these lawyers said, was necessary to indict the entire firm. 
The government's decision to bring the first indictment in the Enron case against Andersen signals an aggressive strategy by the prosecutors. From their larger fraud inquiry, they are seeking to break off manageable portions of the case and file charges quickly.
This approach steps up the pressure on possible witnesses to cut deals, because they now know that an indictment could come with little warning -- or could even be filed under seal without their knowledge, a move that limits their negotiating ability.
The unsealing of the indictment, in Federal District Court in Houston, came after more than a week of sometimes acrimonious discussions between the government and Andersen. Prosecutors told the firm that it had until 9 yesterday morning to plead guilty or face indictment.
Andersen refused the offer late Wednesday night. Richard J. Favretto, a lawyer with Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw, which represents Andersen, told Leslie Caldwell, the prosecutor in charge of the Enron task force, that the firm would not plead guilty, despite the deadline.
Communications between the government and Andersen grew particularly contentious in the hours leading up to the indictment.
Late Wednesday night, Mr. Favretto sent a letter to Michael Chertoff, the deputy attorney general, attacking the government's plan for the indictment point by point, 
Mr. Chertoff responded in a two-page letter today, forcefully describing the document destruction as part of a chain of misdeeds that, taken together, ultimately demanded that criminal charges be filed. 
Among other things, Mr. Chertoff wrote, the document destruction in the Enron case came just months after Andersen entered into an agreement with the S.E.C. arising out of an accounting fraud investigation involving another Andersen client, Waste Management. As part of that settlement, Andersen agreed not to commit misdeeds in the future. 
Mr. Chertoff also stated that, in this case, the document destruction was not committed because of some benign motive. "The conduct here was not the isolated act of a few low-level employees acting out of panic or engaging in misjudgment," he wrote.
In his letter, Mr. Chertoff also rejected the position of Andersen's lawyers that the government bears responsibility for the financial consequences of the firm's indictment. "Andersen's reputation is in jeopardy because of its underlying misconduct, not because of the government's enforcement of the laws against that misconduct," he wrote. 
The indictment itself offers few specifics. It says that the obstruction of justice began on Oct. 10, without describing what documents were destroyed at that point, or by whom.
The only event described in the indictment that seems related to that date is the firm's decision the day before to hire an outside law firm "to handle future Enron-related litigation." Prosecutors apparently considered this step a sign that the firm knew investigations would soon begin. 
The Andersen legal team said yesterday that the law firm of Davis, Polk & Wardwell was hired to assist Andersen when the Enron matter was growing increasingly complex, and not for the sole purpose of assisting in lawsuits or defending the firm in investigations.
According an an internal investigation by lawyers for Andersen, the wholesale shredding began weeks later in Houston, on Oct. 23 -- the day after Andersen partners there learned that the S.E.C. was about to request accounting records related to Enron.
The indictment contains no details of the document destruction outside Houston. The internal investigation found that the destruction in Portland and London came at the instigation of partners from Houston. That report does not describe the amount of material destroyed in London, but says little was shredded in Portland.
In Chicago, according to Andersen's lawyers, documents were destroyed beginning in September -- long before any S.E.C. investigation -- on the advice of the firm's legal department. 
The indictment is certain to increase Andersen's troubles on yet another front, with state governments, which license auditors. 
Accounting boards in a number of states, including Texas, Florida and Connecticut, are already investigating Andersen and Enron, and the number of those investigations is likely to increase sharply as a result of the indictment. "Every state board will be taking a look at what the Enron-Andersen impact will be," said David A. Costello, president of the National Association of State Boards of Accountancy.
Though some states might issue emergency suspensions of Andersen's licenses, other state boards would first require a conviction. 
Robert A. Butterworth, Florida's attorney general, said that the criminal indictment might give his state's accountancy board cause to suspend Andersen's license. But he said that it would be unfortunate if legal culpability for Enron's collapse began and ended with Arthur Andersen. "Andersen was the weakest link, because of the shredding," he said. "But there is no way the country would sit still for letting Andersen take the fall for Enron."

HEADLINE: Bush Plans to Raise Foreign Aid and Tie It to Reforms 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14 

 BODY:
President Bush today proposed a three-year, $5 billion increase in American foreign aid to poor nations that support human rights, adhere to strong systems of law and have open markets.
 The new money represents a roughly 15 percent annual increase in America's existing $10 billion annual foreign aid budget, which has not grown in a decade and is at its lowest level since World War II. International development experts called the additional $5 billion significant, although not nearly as much as they said was needed. 
 Mr. Bush made the promise of aid, which must be approved by Congress, contingent on the recipients' undertaking a broad range of economic, political and social reforms. 
"We will reward nations that have more open markets and sustainable budget policies -- nations where people can start and operate a small business without running the gantlets of bureaucracy and bribery," Mr. Bush said in a speech at the Inter-American Development Bank.
Mr. Bush also linked foreign aid to the eradication of terrorism, at least as a prescription to help "failed states" that harbor terrorists.
"Poverty doesn't cause terrorism," Mr. Bush said. "Being poor doesn't make you a murderer. Most of the plotters of September the 11th were raised in comfort. Yet persistent poverty and oppression can lead to hopelessness and despair. And when governments fail to meet the most basic needs of their people, these failed states can become havens for terror."
Mr. Bush was joined on the bank's stage by Bono, the lead singer of the Irish rock band U2 and an advocate for the poor, who met with the president in the Oval Office just before the speech. Development experts said that in recent weeks Bono had worked extensively with senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, to push for the increase in aid.
"As you can see, I'm traveling in some pretty good company today -- Bono," Mr. Bush said, gesturing to the singer, who had on his signature sky blue wraparound sunglasses. Mr. Bush said that Bono "is willing to lead to achieve what his heart tells him, and that is nobody -- nobody -- should be living in poverty and hopelessness in the world."
Mr. Bush's speech was in essence a pre-emptive strike before a conference he will attend next week in Monterrey, Mexico, on global aid to the poor. 
The United States has come under increasing criticism from Europe and development agencies for its foreign aid budget, which is the smallest, relative to the size of the economy, of any rich nation.
"He had to step forward and assert leadership," said C. Fred Bergsten, the director of the Institute for International Economics and an advocate of increased spending on development assistance. "It takes him to Monterrey in a much more positive vein. Otherwise he would have gone down there as the target of criticism and attacks from everybody else." 
Nonetheless, Democrats and some development agencies said that the $5 billion increase, which would not take effect until 2004, was too little, too late, and that it paled beside Mr. Bush's proposed $48 billion increase in military spending.
"Where's the beef?" said George Soros, the billionaire philanthropist and longtime donor to developing nations. "It's totally inadequate as far as the amounts involved -- a token gesture instead of something that could successfully impact most of the poor countries. This is unfortunately not receiving the kind of priority that other things are receiving in the government."
Mr. Bush's speech was praised by James D. Wolfensohn, the president of the World Bank, even though the $5 billion increase fell short of what Mr. Wolfensohn has asked for, which is a doubling of foreign aid spending by all rich nations. Mr. Wolfensohn and the Bush administration have been locked in a confrontation over the bank's effectiveness.
Today, with Mr. Wolfensohn on the stage, Mr. Bush called once again for reforms at the bank. Mr. Bush's Treasury secretary, Paul H. O'Neill, has said that the bank has driven poor countries "into a ditch" by lending instead of donating funds.
"We applaud the president for his statement on the importance of increasing development assistance," Mr. Wolfensohn said in a brief statement.
In his speech, Mr. Bush said that the additional $5 billion would expand his administration's fight against AIDS, bring computer instruction to young professionals in developing countries and help African businesses sell their goods abroad. 
"The goal is to provide people in developing nations the tools they need to seize the opportunities of the global economy," he said. "In return for this additional commitment, we expect nations to adopt the reforms and policies that make development effective and lasting."
Mr. Bush said that Mr. O'Neill and Secretary Powell would develop "clear and concrete and objective criteria" for determining if a nation met the American standards for foreign aid, and that the standards would then be applied "rigorously and fairly." Mr. Bush was not more specific, and development experts said they could not judge the effectiveness of the criteria until the administration determined how they would be defined, monitored and enforced.
Other administrations as well as the World Bank have set preconditions for foreign aid, but this is the first time that Mr. Bush has announced a clear-cut policy that he wants to make a cornerstone of his administration's foreign aid. 
Mr. Bush called it a "new compact for global development" that is to be defined by "a new accountability" for both rich and poor nations. "Greater contributions from developed nations must be linked to greater responsibility from developing nations," he said.
Mr. Bush is to leave next Thursday for Monterrey, followed by visits to Lima, Peru, and El Salvador before returning to Washington on March 24.

HEADLINE: A NATION CHALLENGED: THE VICE PRESIDENT; 
Cheney Asks Yemen to Join the Pursuit of Al Qaeda's Remnants

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL R. GORDON 

DATELINE: MUSCAT, Oman, March 14 

 BODY:
Vice President Dick Cheney flew to Yemen today amid extraordinary security to press for joint efforts against remnants of the organization called Al Qaeda.
 After two days of discussions in Jordan and Egypt on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, today's meeting provided Mr. Cheney with an opportunity to turn to what his aides call the "new agenda" of Middle East issues: fighting terrorism and building support for an American campaign against Iraq. 
 A senior American official said Mr. Cheney had used his meeting with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh primarily to discuss assistance to prevent Yemen from becoming a haven for terrorists. Along with other issues, President Saleh registered his opposition to a potential American attack on Iraq and his concerns about Middle East violence. 
The Pentagon is planning to dispatch American Special Forces to train Yemen's military in counterterrorism operations. An adviser to President Saleh said today that the advisers from the United States would consist of three teams, each of which would have 20 to 30 members and would stay about a month.
"People are understanding the importance of having trainers," the adviser said. "They do not want the Americans to come in and do the fighting. They feel it is the Yemenis who should fight against terrorism."
A Pentagon official said the details of the training program were still being worked out but the number of advisers would be relatively small. Navy and Coast Guard advisers have already been helping to train the Yemeni forces that patrol its 1,500-mile-long coast.
Strategically located along the Arabian Sea and just across the Red Sea from Somalia, Yemen is the ancestral home of the bin Laden family. The power of the central authority is limited and much of the country is run by local tribes.
"The central government does not really control the whole territory," a former Western diplomat said. "You have got tribes and sheiks who are powerful in their own areas. It is a traditional society whose brand of Islam is a version of Shiism."
Yemen had close relations with Iraq before the Persian Gulf war and opposed the allied military campaign to evict Iraqi forces from Kuwait. The United States cut off aid afterward and froze the delivery of spare parts to Yemen's air force.
Relations gradually improved, and the United States Central Command sought to wean Yemen away from Islamic extremism and develop its ties further. 
That led to the visit to the Yemeni port of Aden by the destroyer Cole in 2000. Seventeen American sailors were killed when the ship was the subject of a terrorist bombing. Yemeni officials have said they are looking for two suspected Qaeda members, Muhammad Hamdi al-Ahdal and Qaed Salim Sunian al-Harethi, in connection with that attack.
Many of the militants who fought with the Taliban in Afghanistan came from Yemen, particularly the border region near Saudi Arabia. Yemen also became something of a magnet for militants from other nations. After the American campaign in Afghanistan there was speculation that American forces might begin hunting for Al Qaeda fighters in Yemen. Yemen expressed an interest in receiving American training so that it might conduct the operations itself.
"They thought they better get on board or they would be the object of American force," the former Western diplomat said.
A senior American official said the Yemen trip was scheduled after President Saleh requested the visit in a phone call to President Bush.
Mr. Cheney's visit entailed extensive security precautions. While the adviser to Yemen's president insisted there were no longer Qaeda training camps in Yemen, the country was regarded by American officials as one of the riskiest stops on Mr. Cheney's trip. In February, the F.B.I. issued a warning that there might be terrorist attacks in the United States or against American interests in Yemen. The same month, a suspected Qaeda member blew himself up after being surrounded by security forces in a suburb of Sana.
Mr. Cheney arrived on a C-17 transport plan, which took evasive maneuvers, instead of arriving on his official plane, Air Force Two. Mr. Cheney conducted his meetings at the airport and departed after only a few hours for neighboring Oman. Mr. Cheney said after his meeting with Yemen's president that he had discussed the American campaign against terrorism, United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iraq, as well as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Another subject was American economic assistance, a reward for cooperating with Washington in its antiterrorism campaign.
"We have increasingly developed close relations between ourselves and Yemen," Mr. Cheney said. His trip followed visits to Yemen by the heads of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Command.
In Yemen, as in Egypt and Jordan, Mr. Cheney encountered opposition to the Bush administration's efforts to mobilize support for tough action against Iraq. President Saleh told Mr. Cheney that he opposed an American military campaign to topple Saddam Hussein and would join Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in urging Baghdad to admit United Nations weapons inspectors.
President Saleh also told reporters that Yemen was concerned about the fighting between Israel and the Palestinians and wanted an "intensive effort" to end the violence.

HEADLINE: Next Stop, Lower Manhattan: More Ferries on the Hudson 

BYLINE:  By DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
Ferry service between Manhattan and New Jersey will be expanded later this month, state and local officials announced yesterday, citing increased demand stemming from the loss of PATH service downtown since Sept. 11.
 "For the first time in modern memory, you can get from New Jersey to New York with enormous frequency," said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, adding that boats would also shuttle riders around the southern tip of Manhattan. 
 New York's governor, George E. Pataki, who was joined by Gov. James E. McGreevey of New Jersey, called the expanded service a symbol of reclaiming the waterfront. 
Mr. Pataki added that the extra ferries would run until PATH service was restored to Lower Manhattan, scheduled for late next year, and could serve about 63,000 passengers a day. 
The added service, whose operation by New York Waterway will, in an unusual arrangement, be subsidized by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, include a free water shuttle to carry commuters between the World Financial Center on the Hudson River and Pier 11 on the East River, more frequent service from the Hoboken Rail Terminal to the World Financial Center, and a new route between the Hoboken Rail Terminal and Pier 11. New York Waterway will begin the new service, which will be free for the first week, on March 25, officials said. 
Both routes from Hoboken, which will cost $3 each way or $80 monthly, are to operate every 6 minutes during the morning and evening rush hours and every 20 minutes during off-peak periods Monday through Friday and between 10 a.m. and 9:50 p.m. on weekends. The free shuttle service is to operate every 15 to 20 minutes seven days a week.
Daniel Doctoroff, deputy mayor for economic development, estimated the cost of the new service at $2 million a month, to be covered by a combination of fares and FEMA subsidies. Bloomberg administration officials said yesterday that the new routes were the first phase of a multiphase plan to expand ferry service throughout the region.
But some City Council members were muted in their response to the announcement. 
"Improving ferry service from New Jersey is important for Lower Manhattan, but the benefits for the city are limited," said David Yassky, a Brooklyn councilman.

HEADLINE: A Star Close to the Heart of Aid Policy 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14 

 BODY:
Bono, the Irish rock star who doubles as a celebrity campaigner for aid to poor countries, recently introduced himself as "the poor man's James Joyce or the thinking man's Perry Como." He might have added that he has become the conservative man's Mother Teresa.
 While plenty of stars align themselves with popular social causes, not so many align themselves with the Bush administration, which has opposed a global warming treaty and funds for international family planning that many left-leaning celebrities endorse. But there is no denying that Bono has a way with Republicans. 
 "It's very unhip for both of us," he said of his links to conservatives. "We have to take 'good guys' and 'bad guys' out of this and just have a dialogue." 
Bono, the singer for the band U2, has repeatedly lobbied the White House to spend more to fight AIDS and to endorse United Nations goals to cut poverty in half by 2015.
In February, he flew east to meet with with Condoleezza Rice, the National Security Adviser, to discuss measures to increase the amount of money rich countries devote to helping poor ones -- and Bono's terms for sharing the platform with Mr. Bush today.
Bono bonded so well with the sometimes curmudgeonly Paul H. O'Neill, the Treasury secretary, that the two decided to tour Africa together in May. Jesse A. Helms, the crusty North Carolina Republican and a skeptic of foreign aid, said Bono changed his mind on granting debt relief to poor nations and increasing AIDS funding.
"You can see the halo over his head," Mr. Helms said.
Bono claims, and some administration officials say he deserves, some credit for prodding the White House to take a more energetic approach to stemming the spread of disease and economic malaise in Africa and other countries.
Mr. O'Neill said after a Group of 7 finance ministers meeting in Ottawa this year that he originally dismissed Bono as "just another celebrity who wanted to use me." But Bono's command of details impressed him. "He's serious," Mr. O'Neill said, adding that the Treasury Department has received about 20,000 e-mail messages from U2 fans pressing for more action on AIDS.
Bono also appeared to get through to Mr. Bush, who told the singer and administration officials that AIDS in Africa was comparable to genocide, implying that fighting it has become a moral imperative. The president had not described AIDS in such dramatic terms before.
"Those are words that make us complicit if we don't take action," Bono said in an interview.
Asked if he felt the administration was using him to endorse proposals that will not deliver an immediate boost in aid, Bono acknowledged the possibility, but said he expected Mr. Bush to live up to his words.
"I would quote from another Republican president, Reagan," he said. "We are going to trust but verify."

HEADLINE: China Files Complaint to W.T.O. on Steel Tariffs 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Friday, March 15 

 BODY:
China, the world's largest steel maker, filed a complaint today to the World Trade Organization against the United States' decision to impose tariffs of as much as 30 percent on steel imports to protect its producers.
 China, which joined the trade body in December, said that Washington's decision violated fair trade practices and that it wanted to negotiate with the United States to reach a resolution to the dispute. 
 President Bush's decision to impose the tariffs angered government and steel industry officials from Sydney, Australia, to Seoul, South Korea. Australia, Japan and South Korea have also said they may complain to the W.T.O. to have the duties revoked. 
"We object to U.S.'s protectionist policy," said Chen Rongkai, an official at the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation in Beijing. "We ask the U.S. government to scrap these unfair practices."
United States steel imports declined to about 30 million tons last year after reaching a record 39.7 million tons in 1998, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. Almost one-third of those imports came from Canada and Mexico, two countries exempted from tariffs.
The decision by President Bush handed American steel makers a victory in their bid for protection from what they say is a surge of low-priced imports. Since 1998, 19 steel companies, including LTV and Bethlehem Steel, have sought bankruptcy protection.
United States import barriers may divert South Korean and Japanese steel to China, the fastest-growing steel market, and reduce prices, analysts said.
"Although China doesn't export much to the U.S., this decision will hurt the profitability of Chinese steel companies," Mr. Chen said.
China's State Economic Trade Commission predicted in February that the country's steel companies would see profits reduced this year because of cheaper imports, which would reduce local prices for the metal by as much as 200 yuan ($24.16) a metric ton from last year.
The Baoshan Iron and Steel Company, China's largest and most profitable steel maker, said its 2001 net income fell 14 percent. It predicted that sales this year may fall 5 percent, as cheaper imports cut its market share.

HEADLINE: Immigrants Help Us All 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "House Passes Immigrant Bill to Aid Mexico" (front page, March 13): America's economy relies heavily on immigrant workers to pick crops and do other hard essential labor where the supply of local workers is inadequate. Unions now support legalizing the status of undocumented workers so that they will not depress wages for all low-skilled laborers. 
 Hispanic immigration, overwhelmingly Mexican, has immensely benefited our economy in Georgia. Without the thousands arriving at peak ages for maximum labor output, scores of poultry plants, construction companies, hotels, farms, meatpacking plants and other businesses would have closed or relocated. Also, Hispanic buying power has tripled since 1990 as a growing number of immigrants have bought homes and opened businesses. 
 The many benefits of immigration need to be emphasized, as well as the drawbacks. I hope that the Senate will pass the House bill.

HEADLINE: Zimbabwe's False Friends 

BYLINE:  By David J. Simon; David J. Simon is a research fellow at Harvard's Center for International Development and a lecturer at the Kennedy School of Government.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Robert Mugabe's declaration of victory in the presidential elections held last weekend in Zimbabwe was, despite his unpopularity, hardly a surprise. He had already tweaked the system in so many ways that such an outcome was nearly inevitable. As Morgan Tsvangirai, who lost to Mr. Mugabe, said, the election was stolen in a "daylight robbery." It is neither surprising nor inappropriate, therefore, that most Western supporters of democracy have condemned the elections. What is a surprise and a tremendous disappointment is the endorsement of the elections by the Organization of African Unity, which had sent an observer team.
 Citing high turnout rates and the "able manner" in which polling officers conducted the election, the organization, which was founded in 1963 and has 53 member states, declared that "in general, the elections were transparent, credible, free and fair." The elections were none of those things. Thugs associated with the ruling party had physically attacked opponents of the Mugabe regime for months prior to the election. Mr. Tsvangirai's party, the Movement for Democratic Change, estimates that 100 of its supporters were killed in pre-election violence. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Mugabe's supporters broke up opposition rallies. Much of the international press was run out of the country. Mr. Mugabe implemented laws that curtailed press freedom, limited mass gatherings, undermined the independence of the electoral administration and altered (in the ruling party's favor) the requirements for voting. 
 In the week before the election, Mr. Mugabe's electoral commission reduced the number of polling places in urban areas, where the opposition party had strong support. On the two days set out for the election -- as well as a third, allowed by the Supreme Court when it became clear that urban polling stations were overwhelmed -- Mugabe supporters reportedly intimidated voters and chased away independent observers.
What makes the verdict of the Organization of African Unity profoundly disappointing is not just that it is so clearly wrong, but that it harks back to old and destructive habits, weakens recent commitments to positive change and may undermine the fragile relationships that have been developing between Africans and international aid institutions.
The O.A.U. has long been perceived as a club for corrupt, authoritarian leaders distinguished primarily by a tolerance of each others' misdeeds. However, the past decade has been one of political liberalization across the continent. Competitive, if not exactly flawless, elections took place in some of Africa's highest-profile countries, including Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal and South Africa. Bolstered by evidence that stable democracies provide a better environment for investment, and therefore development -- and encouraged by a greater interest in good governance on the part of donor institutions like the World Bank -- Africa's new democratic leaders called for a continentwide commitment to democratic principles.
The O.A.U. launched the New Partnership for Africa's Development last October. The partnership's manifesto acknowledges that "development is impossible in the absence of true democracy" and calls for leaders "to respect the global standards of democracy, the core components of which include . . . fair, open, free, and democratic elections." Africa was to have a "new resolve to deal with conflicts and censure deviation from the norm."
The failure to criticize the way the Zimbabwean elections were conducted demonstrates that the new resolve and the confidence to censure deviation have yet to be found.
The partnership could be easily dismissed as a rhetorical exercise and left unmourned. Such failures are common enough. But the need for something like the African partnership is so great that one hates to dismiss it, even after this miserable performance. The O.A.U.'s acceptance of the Zimbabwe mess hinders the effort under way to realize the United Nation's Millennium Declaration -- a truly novel effort to fight global poverty. At the heart of this effort, which has been endorsed by the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development as well as the Bush administration, is a compact between rich countries and poor ones: The former will be more generous and aggressive in attacking poverty, provided the latter commit to the economic policies and democratic institutions most likely to be conducive to real progress.
The New Partnership for Africa's Development seemed to be evidence that African governments had committed to making changes in their approach to development, and that governments in developed countries could have more faith that their aid would bring positive results. The O.A.U.'s endorsement of Mr. Mugabe's conduct will undermine that faith.
Yet the events in Zimbabwe should not lead wealthier countries simply to give up hope for political and economic progress in the region. Next week's International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, Mexico, sponsored by the United Nations, presents the chance for leaders of poor and rich countries alike to recommit themselves to spreading the benefits of globalization and the principles of good governance. African leaders acquiescing to Mr. Mugabe's election fraud needlessly endanger hope for progress on that front.

OPEC Decides to Keep Production Limits in Place

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: VIENNA, March 15 

 BODY:
Ministers from the world's major oil-exporting countries decided today to maintain their restrictions on output and signaled a reluctance to increase production unless prices rise significantly.
 The decision, though expected, makes it more likely that the recent rise in oil prices will continue as the summer driving season approaches. 
 Oil prices typically rise in the second half of the year, and a recovery in the world economy is expected to help lift demand for oil at least modestly.
The big uncertainty is whether the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will reverse some of the production cuts it imposed last year. The ministers are to meet again in June. 
Oil ministers meeting here today made it clear that they saw no need to increase production right now, noting that prices are still at the bottom of OPEC's preferred range of $22 to $28 a barrel. And some ministers said it might not be necessary in June.
"An oil output hike in June is not foreseen," said Venezuela's oil minister, Alvaro Silva. "We have seen the economy functioning at $28 a barrel."
Analysts say that Saudi Arabia, the leading producer, will probably insist on increases before prices reach $28. That is because the Saudis and several other OPEC members worry as well about stopping the incipient global economic recovery and thereby squelching demand.
Indeed, oil prices dipped slightly today after rising steadily for several weeks.
OPEC has reduced its output by about four million barrels a day in the last year. Prices for West Texas Intermediate crude oil -- a widely followed benchmark -- have climbed from a low of $18.50 in December to about $24 a barrel today. Much of that increase occurred in the last three weeks.
OPEC's self-imposed cuts, which member countries have adhered to with relatively little cheating, have been one reason for the rising prices. But prices were pushed up further by anxiety over a possible American attack on Iraq, jumping after President Bush listed Iraq as part of an "axis of evil" with Iran and North Korea.
Analysts said that OPEC's leaders were grappling with great uncertainty. "They know that the economy is recovering, but that it has not yet recovered," said Michael Rothmann, an oil analyst with Merrill Lynch. "They don't want to see that stop."
The International Energy Agency has predicted that demand for oil will grow modestly this year, by about 450,000 barrels a day. At the moment, inventories in the United States are relatively high, and they are much higher than they were a year ago.
But inventories are already declining, and analysts say there will be a clear need for more oil production by June or July.
"I think it's very likely that in June they will have to increase production," said Roger Diwan, managing director of the Petroleum Finance Company, an industry consulting firm in Washington. "If they wait until September, what will happen is what happened in September 2000, when they could not increase production fast enough to keep up with demand."
OPEC has become far more cohesive in the last two years, and its impact on world prices has increased correspondingly. But its share of the world market has slipped from about 40 percent two years ago to about 36 percent today.
The cartel's position has also been strengthened by the cooperation of Mexico and Norway, two big non-OPEC producers. 
The other major wild card is Russia, which is not part of OPEC but is the world's second-largest oil exporter. Its production has increased sharply, thanks to investment in more modern technology.
Russia agreed last year to a token cutback in exports of 150,000 barrels a day for three months, though its domestic production appears to have increased. Sibneft, Russia's sixth-largest company, this week announced plans to increase output by 29 percent, to 530,000 barrels a day.
Yukos Oil, Russia's No. 2 producer, expects its output to grow 20 percent this year, to 1.5 million barrels a day.
Russian officials have refused to say whether they will support OPEC's continued restraint, though they have said they will reach a decision next week.
But in an indication of Russia's growing importance, OPEC leaders seriously considered holding their next meeting in Moscow rather than the usual location here in Vienna.
That idea appeared to have fallen by the wayside, but OPEC officials said it was treated as a plausible way to build bridges with Russia.
At least for the short term, analysts said, Russia's intentions are probably irrelevant to the outlook for prices, because its reductions so far have been trivial in comparison with those carried out by Saudi Arabia and the other big OPEC producers.
The bigger issues are whether the United States will get into a shooting war with Iraq, which would probably send oil prices on an extraordinary roller coaster, and whether the major OPEC producers decide to increase pumping this summer.
Gary N. Ross, president of PIRA Energy, an industry research group in New York, predicted that oil production would increase but not before prices climbed higher.
"An increase in production is inevitable," Mr. Ross said today. "But it will have to be led by higher prices."

DATELINE: OTTAWA 

 BODY:
The White House is so happy with its new color-coded rankings for warnings of terrorist threats -- red for severe risk, blue for general risk and so on -- that plans are afoot to expand the system. Why stop at a few colors -- or one kind of risk? Americans need as much information about potential dangers as they can get. Here's what a more complete system looks like.

Phase II: Finer delineation
 Turquoise: Not quite blue, not quite green, turquoise says, "Hey, everything's basically O.K., but if you see a guy with a gun, start running." 
 Teal: Much like turquoise, but turn up your alert status just a tad.
Gold: Not a high risk of attack, but definitely greater than a significant risk. This one is easy to remember, as it also signifies a good time to switch your portfolio from equities to precious metals.
Burnt sienna: Somewhere between a severe and a high risk of attack. Best not to mingle in groups.
Scarlet: You might want to stay home today -- unless your home is in a major metropolitan center. Then you should probably start to panic.
Black: It's too late for panic. Accept the inevitable.

Phase III: Expanded risk
Gray: Be on the alert for an increase in vague assurances of public safety.

HEADLINE: In March, Consumer Confidence Hit HighestLevel in 15 Months 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15 

 BODY:
Consumer confidence rose in March to its highest level in 15 months and factories stepped up production in February, two reports released today showed, bolstering views of an accelerating economy.
 The 0.4 percent increase in production at factories, mines and utilities last month came after a 0.2 percent gain in January and was the largest since June 2000, Federal Reserve figures showed. It was the first back-to-back increase since August and September of 2000. Analysts had expected a 0.2 percent rise. 
 The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index jumped to 95 this month, the highest since December 2000, from 90.7 in February. That may underpin spending as the economy bounces back from a recession that began a year ago and explains why central bankers are expected to begin raising interest rates by midyear.
"We made the turn," said Paul Kasriel, director of economic research at Northern Trust in Chicago. "The recovery in manufacturing has begun, and it's going to build momentum as we move through the first half of the year."
While the Fed's policy-setting Open Market Committee will probably leave the benchmark overnight bank lending rate at a 40-year low of 1.75 percent next week, it may decide that the economy no longer faces a bigger risk from slower growth than it does from rising inflation.
A third report from the Labor Department today showed that the Producer Price Index rose 0.2 percent in February, meeting expectations, after a 0.1 percent January gain. Excluding food and energy, the index was unchanged.
Manufacturers are starting to increase production to meet demand after businesses reduced inventories in the fourth quarter at a record $120 billion pace.
"Businesses have revised their production schedules now that the economy's prospects are looking brighter," said Chris Rupkey, senior financial economist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.
Work at factories, which accounts for almost 90 percent of total United States industrial production, increased 0.3 percent in February, matching the gain in the previous month. The consecutive monthly increase was the first since May and June of 2000.
Production of parts and materials, used to make goods and which account for more than a third of all production, rose 0.6 percent in February after an increase of 0.8 percent. Paper production was up 0.4 percent after a 2.6 percent rise.
The plant-use rate rose to 74.8 last month from 74.5 in January. The February rate was the highest since 75 in October of last year. Electric and gas utility production increased, while mining output declined.
Production of durable goods, which include automobiles, furniture and electronics, rose 0.4 percent for a second consecutive month. Auto and auto parts production rose 0.5 percent after falling 0.1 percent in January.

HEADLINE: A Village Running Dry Hopes It Has Struck Water 

BYLINE:  By WINNIE HU

DATELINE: GOSHEN, N.Y., March 14 

 BODY:
The new well is so crucial here that village workers have stopped by after hours to make sure that it is still flowing. The mayor worries about little else, and neighbors try to reassure one another that this time will be different.
 For the well is not producing oil or gas, but something even more basic to their survival: water. 
 As communities up and down the East Coast focus on the worsening drought, scarce water is old news in this village of 5,400 in Orange County, which is trying to end nearly a century of chronic shortages by tapping into a new lifeline.
But time is running out. The village's main reservoir has only six weeks' worth of water left in it, and the backup reservoir is already dry. It will take another three to four weeks to hook up the new well to the village water supply. 
"It is no exaggeration to say you don't sleep," Mayor Marcia Mattheus said. 
"You can't," she said. "You know the seriousness of having no water. With experience, you measure when it's time to start getting nervous -- and it's time."
Just how the village of Goshen found itself with so little water is a cautionary tale in taking one of the earth's most precious resources for granted, and a timely reminder that access to water, like just about anything of value, is influenced as much by human decisions as by capricious weather patterns and the sheer luck of geography. 
If all this sounds vaguely familiar, that's because that is essentially the premise of the hit Broadway show "Urinetown." 
Only this is the real-life version -- without the music, or the laughs.
Last fall, as other New Yorkers were coping with terrorism and the recession, Goshen residents were bracing for a very different threat. 
The village board passed a resolution in October banning the use of water from the municipal system for washing cars, watering lawns or any outdoor use -- the same kind of restrictions that are just now being imposed elsewhere. Violators could be fined up to $250 and sentenced to as much as 15 days in jail for the first offense.
Except for their timing -- they usually come in the warmer months -- the outdoor-water restrictions were nothing new for a thriving village that uses an average of 600,000 gallons per day in the winter, and nearly a million gallons per day in the summer.
"What you have to understand is that we're perpetually in a water shortage," said James Watt, the village police chief. 
"There are two things that plague Goshen. One is water, and the other is parking. I don't have an answer for that, either."
In a water-rich state, Goshen and much of Orange County have the misfortune of being relatively dry, with few lakes or rivers large enough to serve as municipal water supplies. 
Instead, many villages and towns here rely on a patchwork of artificial reservoirs and wells that have been drained in recent years by droughts and suburban sprawl.
"It's too many straws going into the same glass," said Leonard Curcio, mayor of Washingtonville, which three years ago had to import water in tanker trucks. 
"We just can't get it out of the ground fast enough for them to use."
The constant shortages even led to a movement in the late 1980's to establish a $150-million county water system that would have sold water from a central reservoir system to villages, towns and cities. The Orange County Water Authority was created to oversee the system before the proposal failed in 1992, in part because many municipalities already had their own water supplies. 
"The demand wasn't there," said Jay Beaumont, executive director of the water authority, which still exists to help local governments search for water.
The absence of a countywide system has made life more precarious for the village of Goshen, which draws water from a main reservoir and a smaller backup in the hills above it. Most years, the reservoirs are not enough. And while some of its neighbors have tapped into aquifers, Goshen has not until now.
In the past 15 years, the village has drilled and tested 11 wells without success. Jim Ullrich, an environmental consultant for Goshen, said the village was built on bedrock, which makes prospecting for water especially difficult. Compared with sand and gravel, he said, solid rock has fewer places where water can flow freely. 
"No one's got Superman X-ray vision so they can see what's 50 and 100 feet down," he said. "It's all educated guesswork." 
But many Goshen residents and others say that shortsighted village leaders are also to blame for their chronic water problems. They say that the search for water was not aggressive enough in earlier years, and did not keep pace with the development that brought many more water users into their village.
"They should have had this water problem licked years ago," said Bob Boyle Sr., who owns the Goshen Car and Truck Wash. "People complain all the time. We figure if we're paying for water, we should get to use it."
Like many businesses here, the car wash uses untreated water from a small well on its property so as not to draw down the limited supply in the village's reservoirs. During water shortages, Mr. Boyle posts a sign proclaiming, "We are on well water," in large red letters. "So the village doesn't bother me," he explained. 
Some critics say one reason for the lack of urgency in finding a new water source was that Goshen could always fall back on its neighbor, the village of Florida, which owns the water rights to a 640-acre lake. In the past four years alone, Goshen has paid about $196,000 for lake water, which is piped into the village's water system.
This year, Florida officials shut off the pipeline to Goshen for the first time because of growing concerns about their own water supply in a continuing drought. Though sympathetic to Goshen's plight, John Harter, the mayor of Florida, said his neighbor was "a little lethargic" in finding its own water source. "They only get concerned when they have a shortage," he said.
Ms. Mattheus, the Goshen mayor, said that while prospecting for water is a difficult and costly process, she had made it a priority since taking office three years ago. Since then, the village has spent more than $283,500 on "water exploration," which includes drilling and testing potential wells, she said.
The village also installed a $250,000 pump last year at the backup reservoir to recapture water that had been leaking out since the 1920's. The pump increased the village's water supply by as much as 300,000 gallons a day before the backup reservoir dried up. Without it, village officials say, Goshen would have run out of water long before now.
As the drought worsens, village officials and residents are increasingly placing their hopes on the new well. Initial tests show that it could pump up to 360,000 gallons of water per day, and village officials are expecting to receive emergency approval from state and local environmental and health officials to hook it up to their water system. 
"That's it, that's our straw," Mike Nuzzolese, the village's public works supervisor, said on a recent afternoon as he accompanied Ms. Mattheus to check on the well. 
Set off in a dirt clearing, the well was marked by an iron-encased pipe that descended underground for 70 feet. 
But if Goshen residents have learned anything in the past few weeks, it is not to take their water for granted. "The search isn't over," Ms. Mattheus said. "But this would be enough to make the village whole."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
SharePrices Pushed Higher By Industrial Output Data

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The strongest industrial production numbers since June 2000 gave stocks a solid advance yesterday, but analysts said Wall Street seemed guarded, waiting for more proof that companies were benefiting from the stronger economy.
 At the same time, a consumer confidence survey remained steady, which also pleased the market, but analysts said Wall Street's response seemed more like a rebound than a rally. They said investors were more optimistic but want to see profits rise before sending stocks much higher. 
 "The economic news is making us feel a little bit better, but I think the key to the market going forward is that first-quarter results need to get better," said Nick Sargen, global market strategist at J. P. Morgan Private Bank. "We've got to start seeing consistent evidence that earnings have turned for the positive."
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 90.09 points, at 10,607.23. Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 13.12 points, at 1,166.16. The Nasdaq composite index gained 14.16 points, to 1,868.30. For the week, the Dow rose 0.3 percent, the Nasdaq fell 3.2 percent and the S.& P. lost 0.2 percent.
Wall Street's latest rallies have focused on blue chips. The Dow Jones industrial average has risen 7.1 percent in the last month, and on Tuesday had its highest closing of the year, 10,632.35. The technology-dominated Nasdaq is up about 3.5 percent in the last four weeks.
But not all 30 Dow stocks are participating evenly in the advance. The greatest strength has come in the stocks of basic- material providers and manufacturing companies including International Paper and DuPont, which are trading near their 52-week highs.
Investors also bolstered manufacturers like Caterpillar and consumer cyclical companies like General Motors. Caterpillar gained $1.13, to $59.79, near its 52-week high of $59.94. G.M. rose 85 cents, to $60.75, also near its 52-week high.
Stocks turned positive yesterday on a Federal Reserve report showing a bigger-than-expected 0.4 percent increase in output at factories, mines and utilities in February. The data was the strongest evidence yet that manufacturing was emerging from its downturn.
A University of Michigan report showed that consumer sentiment was at higher-than-expected levels. The consumer confidence index rose to 95.0 this month after standing at 90.7 at the end of February and 93.0 in January.
Investors bid financial stocks higher, including American Express, which advanced $1.54, to $42.15.
Technology stocks were mixed on concerns the beleaguered sector will turn around at a slower pace than the rest of the economy. The software maker Oracle tumbled 84 cents, to $12.60, after reporting disappointing third-quarter results and warning that its returns would not improve before summer. --------------------

10-Year Treasuries Rise
By Bloomberg News
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note gained yesterday as yields at an eight-month high lured investors to the government securities amid signs inflation will remain tame as the economy rebounds. 
Some investors bought the 10-year securities and sold 2-year notes, narrowing the yield gap, as a bet that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates soon to help prevent the recovery from fueling inflation. 
By late in the day, the 10-year note rose 19/32 , to a price of 96 18/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 5.33 percent from 5.41 percent on Thursday.
The 30-year bond rose more sharply, increasing 1 1/32 , to a price of 94 23/32 . Its yield fell to 5.75 percent from 5.83 percent.

HEADLINE: Q&A; 
Friendly Gestures: Israeli Modern Dance With Israeli-Arab Music

 BODY:
Ohad Naharin is the director of the Batsheva Dance Company of Tel Aviv and an Israeli modern-dance choreographer whose work has been performed worldwide. His "Naharin's Virus," based on Peter Handke's absurdist play, will be performed by Batsheva at the Brooklyn Academy of Music April 30 to May 4. Created in 2000 amid Israeli-Palestinian violence, "Naharin's Virus" is set in part to music by an Arab-Israeli composer, Habib Alla Jamal. Mr. Naharin spoke to Jennifer Dunning in by telephone on a visit to Manhattan late last month.
 Does "Naharin's Virus," whose title, you say, has no particular meaning, address Mideast struggles today? 
 It's an adaptation of a Peter Handke play from 1969, "Offending the Audience," which has nothing to do with the Middle East and present times. The play deals with the negating of anything that is conventional about the theater. The original play was just four people standing in front of the audience and talking to the audience about the audience. My work is not the play. The play becomes an important element in my composition.
I think there is a question of politics for one reason: Israel. And also because I've collaborated with an Israeli-Arab musician. I met him during the process of this piece, by chance. We were performing for an Arab audience in Nazareth as a gesture, when it was getting really terrible. 
At the end of our performance, as a gesture to us, they performed their music, from their villages. I met with them several times after that, and we arranged and recorded the music, for the first time, for the piece. It is not the only music in the piece.
What intrigued you about the play?
By eliminating all possibilities for conventional theater, it created a real vacuum. (He laughs.) And a vacuum is a great space to move in. 
What has the response to "Naharin's Virus" been in Israel and elsewhere? 
Some people see it as very political. Some people totally connect to other things in it. Some people also get very offended by it. Some people leave. Some people scream at the end. It gives possibilities to people to react. Being insulted by it comes from misunderstanding. The piece is a lot about examining an audience member and making him aware of his state as he watches the piece. The piece demands that from him. It asks the audience member to listen to his heartbeat. But I think at the same time it keeps you kind of safe and connects you to the pleasure of sensation.
Is "Naharin's Virus" a political piece? 
I would like to say yes in quotation marks. But if you reflect about politics, watching the piece, that's still not what it's about. It's much more about what is not said. 
You know, I'm very informed about what's going on. And I have very clear opinions. Right now, there's a real clash between my politics and my country's politics. It's very tragic what is going on because it's obvious that eventually there will be one of two possibilities: total disaster in the region or a big compromise and peace treaty. So, if we don't want to choose the total disaster, then it will be a peace treaty. And if the peace treaty, why wait? Why make all these mistakes? Why not just compromise now? 
Obviously there are millions of people in this region who don't particularly wish well for us. But the present acts of the Sharon government don't make it safer. It's not a government that seeks negotiations. It's a government that has an illusion of power. And that's something that interests me. 
I think a lot of people in Israel live in an illusion, and that Sharon has infected a lot of people with his phobia. The phobia is really a lack of guilt. It's blaming everybody but yourself. It actually causes you to lose any kind of sensitivity to the suffering of other people. And it's kind of a chronic thing. That's the illusion that I'm talking about. So maybe what I'm trying a little bit to evoke an awareness, just the ability to look at ourselves from a little bit of distance and perspective. 
Does an artist have a responsibility to address the issues of the time? Do you feel you do?
I don't think artists have more responsibility than any other citizens. Earlier in my career, I felt I had to represent my own time. Then I realized that what I wanted for my work was the development of the composition of it. What really gets me excited is that I can arrive to places that I've never been before, not because of my ideas but because of the composition, how I arrange and create tension between things. It's not about making statements.
How has the state of virtual or actual war in Israel affected your own creative life and that of your dancers?
I think we create a real oasis with where we work and how we work. Even though things are tough and really ugly, there is this sense of progress and development in our oasis. And the truth is that in Tel Aviv it's very easy to go on with so-called normal life. Shops are open, buses are running, movies are playing. The sun is rising every morning. And you can shut yourself off from what's happening by concentrating on your work. That's what people do. They just concentrate on their private life and work. I think the peace movement is maybe regaining some voices and forces. But still, it doesn't prevent us from going on creating and doing our work.
Is there any pulling-in among artists in Israel? Are people being more careful or doing less work?
There is a crisis in terms of people getting work. Israel has the worst economy it has had in 50 years. This kind of turmoil can provoke people to voice their feelings, especially artists who have this situation to take and make into their work. But people are not afraid. You have people here like -- what's his name? -- Jesse Helms. Israel is a democracy and there is a real freedom of expression. Sometimes you have to fight for it, but the law is on your side.

U.S. and More Companies Abandon Arthur Andersen
Longtime clients, the federal government and even some of its own foreign affiliates abandoned Arthur Andersen, a day after the accounting firm was indicted for destroying documents related to the Enron collapse.
 Several of the firm's most loyal clients, including Sara Lee and Abbott Laboratories, as well as Northeast Utilities and Brunswick, said they planned to replace Andersen. The federal government also announced that it would give no more work to Andersen or to Enron, whose books Andersen had audited. Page A1. 

The Arthur Andersen partnerships in Spain and Chile have decided to sever their ties with the worldwide Andersen practice. Several other operations, in Italy, Poland, Portugal and Switzerland, were mulling similar steps. C3.

Treasury Chief Differs With Bush
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill told a foreign policy group this week that he disagreed with the Bush administration's decision earlier this month to impose tariffs on imported steel and that the move would cost more jobs in the United States than it would save, people who heard him speak said. A1.

Merck Withdraws F.D.A. Application
Shares of Merck fell 5.8 percent after it announced that it had withdrawn an application for regulatory approval of a new pain reliever called Arcoxia, the successor to the company's blockbuster medicine, Vioxx. Merck expects to refile the application with the Food and Drug Administration with additional data showing that Arcoxia would be effective for an inflammatory spine disorder. C4.

Judges Say Lawsuit Can Proceed
A panel of federal appeals judges in Atlanta has rejected an effort by a group of managed care companies to derail a proposed class-action lawsuit that was filed on behalf of 600,000 doctors. C2.

More Signs of an Economic Rebound
Consumer confidence rose in March to its highest level in 15 months and factories stepped up production in February, two reports showed. Production increased 0.4 percent last month, the largest since June 2000, and the consumer sentiment index at the University of Michigan rose to 95. C3.

Disney Chief Talks About Letterman
Making his first public statement about ABC's failed bid to lure David Letterman from CBS, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company, Michael D. Eisner, suggested that deputies had become overoptimistic about succeeding. Though he had his own doubts, he said, the confidence of Disney and ABC executives convinced him the network had a shot. C14.

Stocks Rise on Production Numbers
The strongest industrial production numbers since June 2000 gave stocks a solid advance. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 90.09 points, to close at 10,607.23. Broader stock indicators also were higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 13.12 points, to 1,166.16, while the Nasdaq composite index gained 14.16 points, to 1,868.30. C4.

Bank Accused of Involvement
Investors who contend they were swindled out of millions by a currency trading firm say that J. P. Morgan Chase bears some responsibility for their losses. Clients of the trading firm, Evergreen International Spot Trading, now defunct, sent money by wire to associated accounts at J. P. Morgan Chase. The bank has said it has no liability. C2.

2 Pension Funds To Oppose Merger
The New York State Teachers Retirement Fund and the Public Employees' Retirement Association of Colorado, which together control less than 1 percent of the shares of Hewlett-Packard, oppose Hewlett-Packard's planned $21.3 billion acquisition of Compaq Computer. C4.

HEADLINE: Europe's Military Gap 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: KLIETZ, Germany 

 BODY:
In live-fire exercises here, the German heavy infantry battalion, the 421st Panzergrenadiers, look terrific, scooting out of Marder armored personnel carriers with new G-36 rifles, while the gunner clobbers a tank on the horizon with 20-millimeter shells.
 But even the tank-heavy, conscript German Army knows that the collapse of Soviet Communism and high technology have changed warfare irrevocably. 
 Some European countries -- notably Britain and France -- have worked to modernize their armies and make them more mobile; Germany, too, is finally engaged in reform, even as 10,000 German troops help keep the peace in the Balkans and Afghanistan.
But the real problem is that only 1.5 percent of Germany's gross domestic product goes to the military, half the proportion allotted by the United States. "The German military knows what has to be done," said Margarita Mathiopoulos, executive director of the Potsdam Center for Transatlantic Security and Military Affairs. "But they don't have enough cash to do it." 
With the war in Afghanistan exposing the disparities between the United States Army and those of the other NATO allies, Europe's perennial unwillingness to spend more for defense has undermined its credibility with the United States and damaged NATO as a military alliance, senior American and European officials say.
America's global responsibilities, matched with sizable and growing investments in high-technology warfare, from satellite communications to Predator drones, are leaving even NATO's most gung-ho European members farther behind. Even after the 1999 Kosovo war, when America's superior power was powerfully on display, Britain and France found they could not jump-start their effort to build a more effective European rapid reaction force.
European governments sense that they are increasingly becoming second-rank powers, unable to affect American foreign policy goals because they can bring too few military assets to the table.
Even NATO's secretary general, Lord Robertson, warns the Europeans of a choice between "modernization or marginalization." The American ambassador to NATO, Nicholas Burns, said recently, "Without dramatic action to close the capabilities gap, we face the real prospect of a two-tiered alliance." There is a risk, he said, that the alliance "is so unbalanced that we may no longer have the ability to fight together in the future."
Kori Schake, a professor at the National Defense University who is joining the German National Security Council as director of defense policy, says the gap between the Americans and the Europeans is reaching a critical point.
After Sept. 11, she said, "American defense spending will increase dramatically, the changes in American forces will accelerate, and U.S. interest in and support for crisis management missions will decline further."
The Europeans, everyone agrees, must concentrate on some obvious improvements. They need to be able to move troops quickly by air, refuel planes in flight, deploy precision-guided munitions and operate with battlefield radar from the sky.
Their inability to do so now stems at least in part from an increasingly diverging view, compared with Washington's, of what is needed to combat the threats and poverty of the developing world.
Devastated by military conflict in the 20th century, Europe prefers to spend its money on social welfare at home and aid to poor countries abroad. The European Union provides 56 percent of the world's aid and 36 percent of the budget of the United Nations. 
Britain and France are serious military and nuclear powers, but the United States is about to move into warp speed. President Bush wants to increase the Pentagon budget by $120 billion over the next five years, including a $48 billion increase next year, which would bring the military budget to $379 billion. That figure exceeds the total military budgets of the world's next 14 biggest defense spenders put together. 
Even more troubling to some, there is an implicit division of labor within NATO -- the Americans fight, and the Europeans clean up and keep the peace -- that is eroding the ideal of a collective alliance.
The European effort to develop its own forces that can operate with NATO's aid but outside NATO is progressing only slowly. "Sept. 11 was not good, either for NATO or for the European defense project," a senior French official said. "When American security was at stake, Europeans expected to be called on to help, but the phone didn't ring."
In Kosovo but even more now in Afghanistan, European offers of military aid were largely spurned by the Americans as of little benefit. "It's all about capabilities," a senior European Union foreign policy official said. "The United States has to balance the aggravation of military partnership with its benefits, and if the benefits aren't very sizable, why bother with the aggravation?"
A senior American official said: "The reality is that we don't need the Europeans to do all that we do. We want a couple of crack divisions that can fight with us in nasty places if necessary. And they can do that by focusing their money and spending it better."
Lord Robertson, the secretary general, said in an interview that there was a need for a serious European rapid reaction force, better special forces, better communication and encryption. In particular, he said, the Europeans need strategic lift and precision-guided weapons like cruise missiles and smart bombs, "which are the only things you can now use to satisfy international law and international public opinion."
The problem can be as basic as transportation. A country as rich as Germany is still unable to deliver more than a third of the troops it promised for peacekeeping in Kabul on schedule because it must rent Russian or Ukrainian transport planes on the commercial market. One country, which NATO officials refused to identify, discussed moving troops to Kabul by railroad.
Yet a European troop transport plane, the A-400 M, a variant of the European-owned Airbus, is stuck in a financing dispute in Germany. Even worse, the plane will take 8 to 10 years to deliver.
Europe spends about $140 billion a year on the military, but on average only about $7,000 per soldier -- compared with $28,000 per American soldier -- on research and development. 
Some fixes would be simple and not terribly expensive, officials and other experts say. To create a smart bomb out of a dumb one involves slapping on an $18,000 guidance package, said William Schneider Jr., chairman of the Defense Science Board, a Pentagon advisory panel, and providing sophisticated data links that have already been developed. "There is no technology transfer needed in this case," he said. "People just need to do it."
European aircraft would then be able to benefit from American airborne battlefield surveillance. Soldiers could easily have better gear able to communicate with American satellites or Predators.
A Rand Corporation study suggests that the Europeans can do enough to fight effectively alongside the Americans by spending some $25 billion to $56 billion more in the next decade, a senior French official said.
Javier Solana, the European Union's chief of foreign and security policy and before that NATO secretary general, said the Europeans could restore and maintain political credibility only by living up to their promises of increased military strength. "We do not set out to rival the United States as a military power, but where we decide to set goals, we must realize them," he said. 
Now, in a phrase that has become almost a cliche, the United States is the power that fights, the United Nations feeds and the European Union finances, while European soldiers, as in Afghanistan and the Balkans, keep the peace. "This kind of complementarity is fine in the short term," the senior French official said. "But George Robertson is right. It must be a partnership or it's not stable in the long run.."
Lord Robertson complains with some bitterness that Germany is the only European country that has increased its military spending at all -- $780 million from a special tax to fight terrorism -- since Sept. 11. Yet he remains convinced that, in the end, "the European allies will do it -- they know they have to do it."
The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, also seems to recognize that the Europeans must pool more power to remain relevant for America. "We don't have too much America," Mr. Schroder recently told the newspaper Die Zeit. "We have too little Europe."

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about the need for European countries to commit more money to modernize their military operations misidentified the group that Kori Schake, who commented on American defense spending, is joining. She will become director of defense policy for the National Security Council in Washington. There is no German National Security Council.

HEADLINE: 'A Beautiful Mind' Meets Ugly Oscar Tactics 

BYLINE:  By RICK LYMAN 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 15 

 BODY:
John Nash says he is not an anti-Semite. He says he is not a homosexual. Nor, he says, did he try to conceal any of his deficiencies as a father or any humiliating episodes in an attempt to glamorize his life. 
 To combat those rumors, Mr. Nash, a Nobel laureate whose triumph over schizophrenia is chronicled in the Oscar-nominated film "A Beautiful Mind," feels obliged to go on national television: he will appearon Sunday's edition of "60 Minutes." Some in the film industry say he is actually the victim of a whisper campaign whose aim is to scuttle the movie's Oscar hopes, a phenomenon they say has become increasingly common in the intense competition for Academy Awards. 
 "This may not be the worst year in Oscar history, but it's pretty low," said Pete Hammond, a film historian and consultant for American Movie Classics. "To accuse the subject of a film of being anti-Semitic when you know that a lot of the people who will be voting on the Oscars are Jewish, well, that's really down and dirty." 
The whisper campaigns, which reach a peak during Oscar balloting, are fueled, the film's supporters say, by the Internet, by a fascination with tabloid-type scandals and by the rise of private Oscar strategists hired by the studios. 
But even in that context, the campaign against "A Beautiful Mind" has struck many in Hollywood as particularly brutal. 
"It's getting nastier," Mr. Hammond said. "It's like a political campaign now. You get these so-called Oscar consultants who go out there thinking, What kind of dirt can we dig up?"
The reports so upset Sylvia Nasar, a former economics reporter for The New York Times and the author of the book (also titled "A Beautiful Mind") on which the movie was based, that she published a commentary in The Los Angeles Times on Wednesday defending Mr. Nash and excoriating journalists who, she said, "invented 'facts' about Nash and his wife, Alicia." 
For example, the reports about adultery, she noted, ignore information in her book that makes it clear that an affair that led to the birth of Mr. Nash's first son was over by the time he married Alicia Larde.
And a letter that a newspaper cited, saying that it revealed him to be a "rabid anti-Semite," was written, she said, after his doctors had diagnosed his condition as paranoid schizophrenia and when he "also believed himself to be Job, a slave in chains, the emperor of Antarctica and a messiah . . . "
Reports about the portrayal of Mr. Nash in "A Beautiful Mind" appeared in December and January on the Web on gossip sites like Matt Drudge's www.drudgereport.com, and in various newspaper gossip columns, as well as in some of the film's reviews, including one in The New York Times; more reports appeared later in The Hollywood Reporter and from The Associated Press, among other sources. Some simply pointed out that the film's director, Ron Howard, and its screenwriter, Akiva Goldsman, had strayed from the facts of Mr. Nash's life. 
Among the charges were that Mr. Nash's early affair was airbrushed from the story and that his frequent close relationships with male friends were also missing (though Ms. Nasar wrote that none of her interviews turned up evidence of homosexual relations). The reports also said that major characters and incidents were invented and that the manner in which he received the Nobel in economic science after nearly three decades of debilitating schizophrenia was romanticized to provide a rousing climax for the film.
The filmmakers responded that they knew that they had taken liberties. But they did so, they said, with the approval of both Mr. Nash and Ms. Nasar. Indeed, they said, the movie's structure is a calculated attempt to fool the audience into sharing some of Mr. Nash's schizophrenic delusions.
"There is nothing that someone with this disease does that doesn't make sense to them," Mr. Goldsman said. "To reflect that for the audience, I had to convince the audience that what they were seeing was real and then rob them of it."
When The Los Angeles Times reported that a representative for Miramax Films had called to direct one of its reporters to one of the Drudge reports, Miramax reassigned the representative, an Oscar strategist, to other duties. Harvey Weinstein, co-chairman of the company, then called executives of Universal Pictures, which released "A Beautiful Mind," to apologize.
Then "A Beautiful Mind" won the Golden Globe for best dramatic film, and earned eight Oscar nominations, including ones for best picture and for Russell Crowe's portrayal of Mr. Nash. The whispering subsided.
But two weeks ago, just after the mailing of the final Oscar ballots, which are due on Tuesday, a fresh wave of whispers erupted. The awards are to be given on March 24.
Mr. Drudge began the reports again, saying he had just become aware of passages in Ms. Nasar's book in which Mr. Nash made anti-Semitic statements. Later reports on msnbc.com and in The New York Post cited complaints from the mother of Mr. Nash's first child about not being included in the film.
"There's been a shocking absence of self-restraint," Stacey Snider, chairwoman of Universal Pictures, told The Hollywood Reporter last week. 
With off-the-record calls to journalists flying around Hollywood, Oscar strategists and studio executives have tried to blame somebody else for this latest whisper campaign.
Miramax issued a statement saying it had nothing to do with the reports. Another studio, 20th Century Fox, which has been campaigning on behalf of "Moulin Rouge!," also denied responsibility.
"We absolutely do not do negative campaigning and believe that the picture should only be judged on the merits," said Jeffrey Godsick, the company's executive vice president for publicity and promotion.
One studio's executive even argued that Universal was now adopting a kind of counter-campaign, blaming other studios in an attempt to discredit their Oscar nominees and transform "A Beautiful Mind" into a sympathy candidate.
"That's ridiculous," said Mark Gill, president of Miramax's West Coast division. "But this is not an accident."
Mike Wallace, who interviewed Mr. and Mrs. Nash a week ago in Princeton, N.J., for "60 Minutes" said "they are devastated." 
Like Ms. Nasar, he stressed that the anti-Semitic statements attributed to Mr. Nash were made when Mr. Nash was schizophrenic. "He knew, he was convinced, that there were secret messages to him on the front page of The New York Times," Mr. Wallace said. "He was mentally ill."
As Mr. Nash says to Mr. Wallace in their interview, "I did have strange ideas during certain periods of time."
Mr. Wallace, of course, has had his own brush with Oscar campaigns with "The Insider," a 1999 film about a real-life tobacco industry whistle blower. He objected to his portrayal in the film.
"I was deeply hurt by that," Mr. Wallace said. "I didn't think it was a bad picture at all, but the final third of it was simply not true."
The ultimate effect of the controversy may be on one of the oldest and most venerable of Hollywood genres, the bio-pic, which has produced Oscar winners from "The Life of Emile Zola" (1937) to "Schindler's List" (1993). 
"I think what it will do is to force the studios to either make a story that adheres very close to the truth or just admit that it is an imagined piece that is inspired by a life," Mr. Gill said. "You'll have to be very clear which is which. You won't be able to have it both ways."
Jeannette Walls, whose MSNBC gossip column reported the complaints from Mr. Nash's first companion, denied that she had been put up to it by any studio and said that its timing was a coincidence. "All of the studios hate me equally," she said today on www.goldderby.com, an Oscar-related Web site. "I'm a gossip columnist."
Others wonder whether, after what has happened to the Nashes, others will allow their life stories to be transformed into films.
"They may want to think twice of turning over the rights of their story," Mr. Hammond said, "when they find out they're going to be taken through the mud like they're on trial."

HEADLINE: Merck Withdraws F.D.A. Filing on Drug; Shares Drop 6% 

BYLINE:  By MELODY PETERSEN

 BODY:
Shares of Merck & Company fell almost 6 percent yesterday after it announced that it had withdrawn an application for regulatory approval of a pain reliever called Arcoxia, the successor to one of its top-selling drugs, Vioxx.
 Merck said it would refile the application with the Food and Drug Administration with additional data that would show that Arcoxia was also effective in treating a chronic, inflammatory disorder of the spine called ankylosing spondylitis, which affects 350,000 Americans. 
 The company had already submitted data to show that Arcoxia was effective in treating rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and several other pain conditions, which together affect millions of people. 
Some analysts said yesterday that Merck might have withdrawn the application because of concerns about the drug's potential cardiovascular risks, a possible problem that slowed the growth of Vioxx sales late last year.
"Merck doesn't acknowledge this in its news release, but there may be a potential risk that Merck may be trying to avoid," said Viren Mehta, a partner at Mehta Partners in Manhattan. "This is a significant setback. It weakens Merck's position in what was to be its key growth area in the near term."
Merck's announcement gave a lift to Pharmacia and Pfizer, which jointly sell the painkiller Celebrex, which, like Vioxx, is a Cox-2 inhibitor, and Bextra, a second-generation Cox-2 inhibitor approved last fall.
Shares of Pharmacia rose $2.84, to $45.25, while Pfizer increased $1.42, to $41.37. Shares of Merck declined $3.69, to close at $59.75.
A spokesman for Merck, Gregory Reaves, said that it was not clear when the Arcoxia application would be refiled. He said that if Merck received approval for the additional treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, it could better compete with Vioxx and Bextra, which have not been approved for so many different uses.
"The information we will be filing," he said, "provides a better and fuller profile of the efficacy and safety of Arcoxia."
Richard R. Stover, an analyst at the investment company Arnhold & S. Bleichroeder, said he thought Merck was worried about a meeting of an F.D.A. advisory panel in May, when the safety of the Cox-2 inhibitors could be discussed. The panel could have reviewed Merck's studies on Arcoxia at the meeting, he said.
Mr. Stover said he could not remember another company that had withdrawn an entire application for a major product in an effort to gain a minor additional use. "It doesn't make economic sense," he said.
Yesterday Mr. Stover cut his rating on Merck to a sell because of the application withdrawal. 
In August, a study in The Journal of the American Medical Association said that both Vioxx and Celebrex appeared to be associated with a small but troubling rise in the risk of heart attacks, a study the drug companies said was flawed.
Sales of Celebrex in the United States last year were $2.4 billion, making it the sixth best-selling drug, according to NDCHealth, a health care information company. Sales of Vioxx, the 13th best-selling drug, were $2.1 billion.

HEADLINE: Sense of Loyalty Keeps Many at AuditingFirm Focused on Their Jobs 

BYLINE:  By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
"What's next?"
 The question is a natural for employees of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen. The firm is reeling from months of damaging revelations, from being dropped by several prominent clients like Merck & Company and Sara Lee, and from being indicted on Thursday for having shredded documents related to the Enron collapse. 
 But Suzanne F. Boorujy-Rummler, an Andersen executive who assigns auditors to client audit teams, said the question had a surprising meaning when she heard it recently from Andersen employees who had worked with Merck. "They are looking for the next opportunity from within" the accounting firm, she said. 
Ms. Boorujy-Rummler said she had expected to hear of colleagues trying to jump ship -- "you'd think there would be a massive exodus." 
Instead, employees who had worked for Merck until it dropped Andersen were calling her to ask what they could do to keep the firm going. 
"This loyalty culture is unbelievable here," she said.
Part defiance, part hoping against hope, employees who were interviewed said most of the 85,000 workers were still dedicated to the job, serving the thousands of clients who have not broken with the firm.
"This is busy season, so there's a lot to do," said Lori S. Grey, director of civic and charitable programs for Andersen. Employees, she said, "have actually been serving their clients and doing what they are supposed to do."
"We have to fight back by staying in business -- by doing our jobs," Ms. Grey said.
Although charitable initiatives are often among the first to be reduced in times of belt tightening, Ms. Grey said she had heard of no plans to cut back.
For Liz Altheizer, the director of recruiting for Andersen's consulting practice in Washington, uncertainty puts her on "the front lines."
Attracting new talent to the firm is difficult when prospective employees want to know what will happen. "None of us knows the answer right now," Ms. Altheizer said.
For those who came up through the ranks at Andersen, with its fiercely proud culture, the loss of face in the Enron scandal and in the wake of the criminal charges, the first such against a major accounting firm, has left them distraught, said Arthur Wyatt, a former Andersen partner who now teaches financial accounting and reporting at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He is a former president of the American Accounting Association.
Like many other current and former Andersen employees, Mr. Wyatt criticized the government's decision to file charges against the firm. He said he believed that whatever wrongdoing might have occurred had been carried out by a small band of rogue employees and not by management.
"I can't visualize a group of people at the top of the Arthur Andersen organization authorizing destruction of records," Mr. Wyatt said. Now, he argued, innocent people will suffer.
"There's nothing I can see that can save the day," he said, "because the process of resolving the indictment is a lengthy one, and they don't have time. They'll be out of business before the thing is resolved."
"If they're innocent," Mr. Wyatt said, "that will be the most hollow victory ever seen. There will be nothing left for the victors."

HEADLINE: Denunciation Of Mugabe By Europeans Intensifies 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: VIENNA, March 15 

 BODY:
European leaders stepped up their denunciations of the recent Zimbabwe election today, with Germany following the lead of Canada by vowing to cut off aid to the government of President Robert Mugabe.
 After three days of voting, during which many people waited in long lines only to see the polls close before they could cast their ballots, Mr. Mugabe claimed to have won re-election with 56 percent of votes cast. 
 But opposition leaders and many foreign observers say that the government made it difficult for people to vote, particularly in areas where Mr. Mugabe's opponents had an advantage, and that the police and army created an intimidating presence at many polling places. 
In Washington, President Bush has said the United States will not recognize the validity of Mr. Mugabe's re-election. The United States has not announced any decision about cutting off aid.
But Germany announced today that it would stop all aid to the Zimbabwe government, and it called on the European Union to follow suit. 
"We will not work with the Mugabe government in any form in terms of development cooperation, and we will urge the E.U. to put further pressure and sanctions" on Zimbabwe, Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul, Germany's minister in charge of development aid, told Parliament today.
Germany will continue providing aid to private organizations, some of which are helping to combat hunger in parts of the country. Germany has provided about $4.6 million in aid to Zimbabwe in the last two years.
Canada announced the same measure on Thursday, after Prime Minister Jean Chretien met with President Bush in Washington. Though Mr. Chretien was reticent at first about the Zimbabwe election, he changed his mind after seeing a preliminary report by observers from the Commonwealth, a 54-nation group of mainly former British colonies, that described a climate of fear surrounding the voting. "It looked pretty bad," Mr. Chretien remarked.
Despite the protests and the potential loss of aid money, Mr. Mugabe appears set to be inaugurated on Sunday for another six-year term.
The European Union will take up the issue this weekend, when leaders from the 15 members hold a summit meeting in Barcelona, Spain. Though it is unclear whether European leaders will agree on a cut in aid or other sanctions, European diplomats said the leaders were certain to issue a "strong statement" condemning the action.
The leader of Europe's observer delegation, Pierre Schori of Sweden, was expelled from Zimbabwe before the election on the ground that he had violated the terms of his tourist visa. Today Mr. Schori declared that the election had been unfair and distorted.
Goran Persson, Sweden's prime minister, today added his voice to the growing chorus of criticism of Mr. Mugabe. "It is a danger for the development of all of southern Africa that those countries which were liberated do not seem to be able to handle the next phase, which is securing democracy," Mr. Persson said. "It is a dangerous situation, and we are all gravely concerned."
Jack Straw, Britain's foreign secretary, said Mr. Mugabe had indulged in blatant cheating and been caught in the act.
Zimbabwe's African neighbors remain reluctant to criticize the election. The observer group from Commonwealth countries, led by South Africa, Nigeria and Australia, appears to be divided. Deputy President Jacob Zuma of South African went to Harare on Thursday to congratulate Mr. Mugabe and pronounced the election free and fair.
The Commonwealth countries are to meet on Tuesday to discuss the observers' report on Zimbabwe, but the group seems unlikely to enact any concrete measures. --------------------

Mugabe Signs Restraint on Press
By The New York Times
 HARARE, Zimbabwe, March 15 -- President Mugabe today signed into law sharp limitations on local and international news organizations operating in Zimbabwe. 
The law, which creates a media licensing commission with considerable disciplinary powers, was passed by Parliament earlier this year. 
But the timing of the signing was unexpected, coming only two days after Mr. Mugabe was declared the winner of an election that had been widely criticized by Western governments and some international organizations.

HEADLINE: U.S. and North Korea Hold High-Level Discussion 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15 

 BODY:
A senior American diplomat met this week with North Korea's ambassador to the United Nations in the highest-level bilateral talks since President Bush denounced North Korea as part of an "axis of evil," the State Department said today.
 Charles Pritchard, the Bush administration's special envoy for North Korea, met with the ambassador, Pak Gil Yon, on Wednesday and agreed to continue the discussions at a later date, according to Richard Boucher, the State Department spokesman. 
 There was no breakthrough, Mr. Boucher said, and the North Korean government has not yet accepted an American offer for negotiations at a higher level. But the encounter appeared to ease a growing war of words between the nations. 
"We found the meeting useful," Mr. Boucher said today. "Both sides agree to continue their discussions at this level from time to time. And we remain willing to explore North Korea's receptivity to accepting our proposal for a dialogue."
The administration offered last June to open negotiations with North Korea as part of a strategy to curb that country's development of weapons of mass destruction in return for economic help. Last month, during a trip to South Korea, President Bush wondered aloud why Kim Jong Il, the North Korean leader, had rebuffed the American proposal.
Relations between the countries have been especially icy since President Bush in January identified North Korea -- along with Iran and Iraq -- as being part of an "axis of evil." Earlier this month, the American media disclosed that a Pentagon review of its nuclear policy identified North Korea as a potential target for a nuclear attack.
The Pyongyang government accused the United States of "preparing a nuclear war to bring nuclear disasters to our planet and humankind," and seeking to recreate the destruction of Hiroshima.
Throughout these exchanges, contacts between the governments have continued at a lower level, Mr. Boucher said.

HEADLINE: Miramax Films Cuts 75 Jobs After Some Recent Setbacks 

BYLINE:  By LAURA M. HOLSON

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 15 

 BODY:
Miramax Films, the movie studio run by Harvey Weinstein, who backed such hits as "Shakespeare in Love" and "Good Will Hunting," notified 75 employees today that they were either being laid off or that their contracts would not be renewed, Miramax said today.
 It is the first time in the studio's 22-year history that it has laid off so many employees at one time, the bulk of whom worked in publicity, production and marketing. The majority are based in New York, although several are in Los Angeles or overseas. The total comes to about 15 percent of Miramax's worldwide work force of 500. 
 "We've reduced our staff to our October 2001 levels," said Matthew Hiltzik, spokesman for Miramax.
In December, up against a huge number of releases from other movie companies, the Miramax offerings "Kate and Leopold" and "Shipping News" became lost in the clutter. And Miramax's biggest investment of the year, Martin Scorcese's "Gangs of New York," has yet to hit the screens after Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Scorcese argued over the length of the film. But one investment that is paying off handsomely is Mr. Weinstein's early minor stake in "Lord of the Rings."
The layoffs come at an interesting time, not only for Miramax but its parent, the Walt Disney Company, which has been struggling in part because of the recession and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, which had an impact on all media companies. Advertising revenue spiraled downward in the months after the attacks, and travelers were afraid to get on airplanes, keeping them away from theme parks. 
But Disney has had other problems, some of its own making. Its ABC network is lagging badly in the prime-time ratings. And its Disney movie operation, which is based in Burbank and run separately from Miramax's New York operations, recently named a new executive to run it, the third in three years.
John Dreyer, a spokesman for the Disney chairman, Michael D. Eisner, said Mr. Eisner was not involved in the decision to trim Miramax's staff, a move, he said, that was generated by the studio. "Michael is not involved in every decision," Mr. Dreyer said in a telephone conversation from Marne-la-Vallee, France, where Mr. Eisner is overseeing the opening of the Walt Disney Studios, the new addition to the EuroDisney resort outside Paris. "This is a Miramax story."
Mr. Weinstein, too, suggested in an interview last fall in New York magazine that Disney, which reportedly paid about $60 million for Miramax in 1993, left his studio alone because "our success was so overwhelming."
Miramax, until recently, seemed untouchable. In January though, Miramax shut Talk magazine, its joint venture with Hearst Magazines that had lost an estimated $50 million since its first issue in September 1999. And the studio, renowned for its lavish spending on talent and campaigns for the Oscar, has been tightening its belt lately.
Much of the production for "Cold Mountain," the movie about a man's voyage home at the end of the Civil War, is likely to shift to Romania from North Carolina, where the story is set, saving the studio millions, Miramax executives said. 
"That has nothing to do with these changes,"Mr. Hiltzik said. "We remain committed to providing the best film at a reasonable cost."
Miramax, which often allows many of its executives and talent to stay at the Four Seasons, has been considering asking employees to stay at the less expensive Ian Schrager hotel chain, said a Miramax executive. The company has also cut back on outsourcing of publicity functions as a way to trim costs.
Several industry executives suggested today that Miramax was trying to decrease overhead by as much as 30 percent over the next 12 months. Mr. Hiltzik said Miramax did not discuss such figures.
The fact that Miramax is cutting back is not necessarily surprising. In recent years, almost all major studios have been cutting costs. Analysts suggest that Miramax is merely catching up and that any cost cuts would bolster Disney's bottom line.
But Mr. Hiltzik bristled at the notion that Miramax was less than golden. The changes, he said, were made after a new chief financial officer came in and re-evaluated the company's books. Last year Miramax had almost $1 billion in worldwide box-office receipts, he said, adding that there are promising projects in the works in its book division. 
Miramax had a down year at the Oscars last year and many in Hollywood are saying that this year will be no different. Mr. Hiltzik pointed out, though, that the company received 15 Oscar nominations this year, including those for "In the Bedroom," "Bridget Jones's Diary" and the French-language film "Amelie." Mr. Hiltzik said that Miramax had received 11 best-picture nominations over the last 10 years. That, he said, is still a record.
Still, several executives involved with Miramax said Mr. Weinstein had been wanting to redirect the studio for some time. In a January interview, for instance, Mr. Weinstein said he wanted to go back to his roots making small independent films.
"For a few years there, it just got away from me," Mr. Weinstein said then. "The success of the company was intoxicating. You start to think, 'Yeah. I can do anything.' " (Mr. Weinstein invested his own money in Broadway plays, including "The Producers," industry executives said.)
Many of Miramax's recent commercial hits, including "The Others," "Spy Kids" and the "Scream" series, were produced by Dimension Films, a division of Miramax that was started and is run by Mr. Weinstein's brother, Bob Weinstein.
Harvey Weinstein is both a shrewd and demanding negotiator who strikes fear among his opponents. He is often compared to old-style media moguls, running a studio that is a cash machine not only for Disney, but for himself. Friends say he has homes in both Manhattan and on Martha's Vineyard, and besides running the studio has few hobbies.

MARTHA STEWART LIVINGCUTS JOBS AT INTERNET OPERATION

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News

 BODY:
 Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, the media and housewares company built on its founder's homemaking tips, cut 40 jobs in its Internet and direct-marketing unit, or about 6 percent of the entire staff. 
The Web unit, which also includes the Martha by Mail catalog, is losing money. The unit lost $6.7 million in the fourth quarter, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, on sales of $17.6 million. The job cuts are unrelated to Martha Stewart Living's relationship with the Kmart Corporation, the bankrupt discount retailer, a spokeswoman, Elizabeth Estroff, said. Martha Stewart is based in New York.
