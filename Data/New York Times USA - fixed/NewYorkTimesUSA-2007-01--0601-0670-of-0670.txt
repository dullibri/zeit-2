HEADLINE: Pfizer's Birthplace, Soon Without Pfizer

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
When the morning shift ends and the afternoon light thins, workers stream out of the Pfizer pharmaceutical plant on Flushing Avenue in Brooklyn. 
 Some head across the avenue to a brick building emblazoned with the ''Pfizer Quality'' slogan. It is a public charter school now, leased by Pfizer to the city for a dollar a year. A few parents walk their children home to the little white-sided town houses across the street, built partly on land Pfizer gave the city in the 1980s.
A block away at a subway entrance, security cameras installed by Pfizer relay any signs of danger back to the guard station at the plant.
 If this area on the Williamsburg-Bedford-Stuyvesant border is not quite Pfizerville, it still may be the closest thing to a factory town in this largely postindustrial city. For 158 years, the Pfizer company has presided over this remote-feeling stretch of Brooklyn, a windswept, big-sky place sliced like a pie by broad, angling streets: first as industrial magnet, then as big brother-benefactor. 
 So Pfizer's imminent departure, which the company announced on Monday, will mean more than the loss of 600 jobs.
 ''I wish it didn't have to end,'' said Ricardo Guadalupe, who was laid off from the plant last year and still gazes at the brick behemoth of a factory every time he drops his two sons off at the school. ''I wish it could have lasted forever.'' 
 The school will remain open, but Mr. Guadalupe, who lives several miles away, now works in New Jersey and is not sure how much longer it will make sense to send his children there. 
 On Monday, Pfizer, the world's biggest pharmaceutical firm, said it would slash 7,800 jobs in the United States, Europe and Japan. Several of its best-selling drugs are losing their patent protection and will face competition from cheaper generics. The jobs at the Brooklyn plant will be phased out over the next two years.
 In many quarters, the announcement was not exactly surprising. For a while now, continuing to operate the Brooklyn plant, where Lipitor, Zoloft, Viagra and other drugs are manufactured and distributed, seemed more a good-will gesture to the borough of Pfizer's birth than a business decision.
 ''They could have left many years ago and found a lower cost-environment,'' said Michael Rochford, executive director of the St. Nicholas Neighborhood Preservation Corporation, a nonprofit group that found buyers for the 140 town houses, named the Edmund T. Pratt Jr. Houses after a Pfizer chairman. ''But they resisted the trend, and then became the catalyst for development as well as providing jobs for the community.''
 But surprise or not, the decision is still a shock. ''This was one of the things that you knew in your gut was going to be in the community forever,'' Reginald Tyson, a 40-year-old out-of-work copier technician, said as he walked by the plant on Thursday afternoon. Mr. Tyson never worked at the plant, but his mother did, and like everyone in the neighborhood, he knew dozens of others who worked there, too.
 Almost from the day more than a century and a half ago that it introduced its first blockbuster drug, a toffee-flavored intestinal-worm remedy called Santonin, Pfizer has been an outsized presence in Brooklyn. 
 Its founders shook and moved the borough. A company scion's rumored dalliance with a burlesque actress was grist for the society pages. ''Mr. Pfizer Rises to Explain,'' read an 1893 headline in The New York Times, ''He Is Interested in Nina Farrington, but Did Not Elope With Her.'' A Pfizer president became a co-owner of the Brooklyn Dodgers.
 Brooklyn, of course, changed, and by the 1970s, the neighborhood around the plant had become a burnt-out dead zone. Drugs and crime were rampant. Inhabited buildings were not.
 Pfizer, which had moved its headquarters from Flushing Avenue to Manhattan in 1961, tried to attract other industrial tenants to the area but could not. 
 Rather than fleeing, as so many manufacturers and corporations did all over New York City in the 1970s, Pfizer, wanting to hold onto both its veteran work force and its birthplace, decided to help rebuild the neighborhood, on the theory that it would be both good for business and good for the neighbors.
 It formed a public-private partnership with the city to develop jobs, housing and education. ''Nothing like it has been tried before by a manufacturer in the city,'' The New York Times wrote in 1985. 
 Pfizer had plenty of unused land near the plant. It cleaned up the property -- not a cheap endeavor -- and granted some to the city for the town houses, two-family starter homes for low- and middle-income owners. The company bought tax credits and conveyed them to nonprofit developers. A handful of blocks away, Pfizer invested in a St. Nicholas corporation apartment building whose tenants used to be homeless. 
 In 1989, an educational reform group wanted to open an alternative public school in the neighborhood. Pfizer offered it the vacant four-story building across Flushing Avenue from the plant, kicked in half a million dollars for renovations and offered a broad support network for the school, called the Beginning with Children Charter School. 
 ''Whenever the founding principal would have an issue, she'd call up Pfizer,'' said Mimi Corcoran, executive director of the Beginning with Children Foundation, which runs the school. ''Employees would come over and mentor our children. They'd send over engineers. They helped build our science labs.''
 Where the towering Pfizer smokestack once stood, Pfizer architects and engineers drew up plans and oversaw construction of a beautiful playground, complete with a gazebo area where the children can have class outside in nice weather.
 ''It sounds kind of Pollyannaish,'' Ms. Corcoran said, ''but they were incredibly generous.''
 Pfizer's loyalty to the city has been amply rewarded by the Bloomberg administration. In 2003, the company was granted $46 million in tax breaks, spread over 15 years, in return for expanding operations in Manhattan. It was not clear whether the closing of the Brooklyn plant would prompt the city to cancel the tax break.
 The school now has 450 students, and its students consistently score higher than the city average, and far higher than students at schools in the surrounding area. Parents who work at the plant feel torn.
 ''If I could happen to find some job around here and still keep my kids in the school, that would be great,'' said Sam Hernandez, a warehouse operator with 11 years experience. 
 But Mr. Hernandez, 30, has moved to Staten Island -- thanks in part to the relatively high wages at Pfizer, which can reach $30 an hour for veteran operators. Like Mr. Guadalupe, Mr. Hernandez said he was not sure how long his children would stay at the school.
 Even after the plant shuts down, Pfizer has promised it will not abandon the area. It plans to spend several million dollars to help turn its boarded-up original 1849 headquarters next to the school into the Charles Pfizer Community Education Center. The center will offer after-school programs, adult education and a training center for science and math teachers.
 Pfizer owns about 10 acres around the plant and, company officials say, wants to work with the community and the city to come up with a comprehensive plan for it that includes housing and commercial space as it sells off its holdings.
 ''Despite the difficult decision to close the facility,'' said Richard Luftglass, Pfizer's senior director for philanthropy, ''we do appreciate the legacy that is there. And we appreciate the obligation to the community.''
 The neighborhoodaround the plant remains shaky and shabby in places, but Kathryn S. Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit business coalition of which Pfizer has been a longtime member, said there was only so much one company could do. And she thanked Pfizer for its efforts.
 ''Had they closed this plant 20 years ago,'' she said, ''it would have been a devastating blow to New York City and to that community in particular. Today, given the state of the economy and the renaissance of Brooklyn, it's a blow, but it's one that we can survive.''

HEADLINE: The U.S. Is Losing Market Share. So What? 

BYLINE: By DANIEL GROSS. 
Daniel Gross writes the ''Moneybox'' column for Slate.com.

 BODY:
LAST week, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Senator Charles E. Schumer released a report that warned of New York's decline as a global financial capital. To remedy this dire state of affairs, the report, by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company, suggested solutions as diverse as easing regulation on publicly held companies and changing visa requirements so investment banks can more easily recruit foreign math whizzes. 
 But the report, which focused on domestic issues like securities regulation, overlooked a major economic trend. The United States is losing market share in the global economy, and that is not necessarily a bad thing. 
 ''It seems to me that the New York intelligentsia are going through one of their occasional bouts of hysteria,'' said Jim O'Neill, head of global economic research in the London office of Goldman Sachs. New York's comparative decline, he said, ''is probably in large part a simple reflection of the growth of the rest of the world.''
 According to Goldman Sachs, the United States' share of global gross domestic product fell to 27.7 percent in 2006 from 31 percent in 2000. In the same period, the share of Brazil, Russia, India and China -- the rapidly growing emerging markets referred to as the BRICs -- rose to 11 percent from 7.8 percent. China alone accounts for 5.4 percent. 
 To be sure, the weakening dollar has aggravated the apparent shift. Even adjusting for the differential power of currencies in their home markets, growth in the United States has lagged global growth over the last 10 years, said Brad Setser, senior economist at Roubini Global Economics in New York. 
 This development is not surprising. For much of the 20th century, China, India and Russia did not participate in the global economic system. As they modernize and build consumer-driven markets, they will grow more rapidly than established economies. The same dynamic led to a convergence of economic performance between Japan and Europe, on the one hand, and the United States on the other, in the decades after World War II. 
 Economists note that the United States continues to play an anchoring, even dominant, role in global financial services, thanks to its deep markets and strong banking systems. In this sphere, the United States is losing out more to European capitals than to Shanghai -- and for reasons that have less to do with regulation and more to do with geography and geopolitics. 
 The euro zone has expanded in recent years to include more countries, thus increasing the appeal of the currency. ''The share of global financial assets denominated in dollars is declining, and that's in large part because of the rise and growth of the euro,'' said Catherine L. Mann, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. 
 Meanwhile, the capital that the United States exports to China, Russia, India and the Persian Gulf is increasingly being used to develop local financial markets. ''It's not entirely surprising that a certain share of financial activity is migrating to foreign geographical locations where savings growth is taking place,'' Mr. Setser said.
 Add it up, and the United States, while still the world's largest single economic power, is clearly no longer the sole superpower. From 2002 to 2005, the United States accounted for 35 to 40 percent of the world's economic growth, according to Goldman Sachs. But in the second half of last year, Mr. O'Neill estimated, the BRICs' contribution to global growth was slightly greater than that of the United States for the first time. In 2007, he projects, the United States will account for just 20 percent of global growth, compared with about 30 percent for the BRICs.
 Despite such trends, Diana Farrell, director of the McKinsey Global Institute, believes that the United States ''will maintain its share of growth over the next two decades.'' She points to a McKinsey survey of global executives in which 27 percent said the United States would account for the most growth in company revenue over the next five years, compared with 25 percent who chose China. Ms. Farrell says she believes that the continued growth of China, India and the rest of Asia will come at the expense of slowly growing, aging Japan and Europe. 
 Ultimately, the decline of economic pre-eminence may be more damaging psychologically than economically. Ms. Mann notes that many people gauge their well-being not simply as a function of how much their income grows, but how much it grows relative to that of their neighbors. ''By virtue of the world becoming richer, in part because of our engagement in international trade, we are getting richer, but many of the poor are getting richer, too,'' she said. ''Psychologically, a lot of people are going to view that narrowing gap as a negative.''
 More broadly, the fact that economies that were closed to outside investment a generation ago are now creating systems of market capitalism should be seen as a victory for the United States, not a defeat. ''Many of the countries that are doing well are mimicking the best of what America has stood for -- globalization and the export of the American capital markets culture,'' said Mr. O'Neill at Goldman Sachs. ''There's nothing that New York and U.S. policies can do about it unless they want to roll back globalization.''

HEADLINE: A Serialist Island Thrives in a Sea of Minimalism

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

 BODY:
IN 1988 the composer Charles Wuorinen was profiled in The New York Times on the occasion of his 50th birthday. The article, ''Wuorinen's Bleak View of the Future,'' written by the music historian Joan Peyser, painted a grim picture of Mr. Wuorinen's fortunes. The thorny, demanding style of serialist modernism for which he had long been known was being eclipsed by Minimalism, and the Group for Contemporary Music, the influential ensemble he helped found in 1962, faced financial crisis.
 The problems Mr. Wuorinen, now 68, faced then have not disappeared. Modernist composers still struggle for a foothold in concert programs, challenged not only by Minimalists but also by neo-Romantics and all manner of pan-stylistic eclectics. Prominent figures have declared modernism a dead issue, hailing its downfall in terms not unlike those used after the collapse of the Soviet Union. And though the Group for Contemporary Music eventually rebounded from its fiscal straits, it is far from the active force it once was. 
But neither has Mr. Wuorinen disappeared. He retains a caustic opinion of those composers he views as opportunistic: whose facile, pop-oriented efforts, propped up by marketing departments, have grabbed most of philanthropic resources. Still he has had plenty of cause to celebrate lately. Recent seasons have included a steady stream of major premieres, many of them due to the emergence of a singularly powerful advocate: the conductor James Levine, music director of the Metropolitan Opera and the Boston Symphony Orchestra.
 Two weeks ago Mr. Levine offered the premiere of a new symphonic poem by Mr. Wuorinen, ''Theologoumenon,'' in a concert by the Met Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. The piece was commissioned as a 60th-birthday gift for Mr. Levine by Ronald A. Wilford, his longtime manager and the chairman of Columbia Artists Management. On Feb. 15 at Symphony Hall in Boston Mr. Levine will conduct another premiere: Mr. Wuorinen's Eighth Symphony (''Theologoumena''), commissioned by the Boston Symphony for its 150th anniversary.
 The works are linked in more than name, Mr. Wuorinen said during a recent conversation in his Upper West Side apartment. ''Theologoumenon'' was a musical response to a text provided by Mr. Wilford, a theological epigraph by the neo-Platonist philosopher Maximus Tyrius. Although the term ''symphonic poem'' traditionally indicates a programmatic work, like Liszt's ''Tasso'' or Strauss's ''Don Quixote,'' Mr. Wuorinen intended his piece as an abstract contemplation. Yet Mr. Wilford, Mr. Wuorinen said, claimed to sense the text in the music.
 What ''Theologoumenon'' evokes may be a matter of personal interpretation. Anthony Tommasini, reviewing the Carnegie Hall performance in The Times, wrote, ''The music could be described as depicting the mind state sought during meditation, when you strive for contemplativeness and let intrusive thoughts just register and then float right by.'' What the restless music unquestionably revealed was Mr. Wuorinen's skill at handling large orchestral forces, with especially inventive use of the percussion section.
 The symphony draws on the same musical materials used in the tone poem but represents ''a directed kind of continuity in the symphonic tradition,'' Mr. Wuorinen said. The two pieces, which were commissioned at roughly the same time, were conceived as parts of a larger whole: a single four-movement work of some 50 minutes' duration.
 ''Levine intends at some point to put them together,'' Mr. Wuorinen said. ''He understood that from the very beginning. We discussed this aspect in connection with both of these commissions.''
 That Mr. Levine is already contemplating revisiting these new works is characteristic of his method. After he and the Boston Symphony gave the premiere of Mr. Wuorinen's Fourth Piano Concerto in Boston in 2005, they repeated it immediately at Carnegie Hall and some time later at Tanglewood.
 ''It sat for three or four months, and then in Tanglewood we rerehearsed it,'' Mr. Levine said by telephone. ''And we all felt that it was in another place. So much more of it was available, accessible. This is what happens if you get that chance. The piece, which might at first hearing have seemed to go by so quickly or so slowly or with this or that striking effect, when you really have a chance to hear it some more, already it starts to be a different thing.''
 Other works by Mr. Wuorinen have figured heavily in Mr. Levine's programming during recent seasons. ''If I get excited by the music of a given composer, I need to know all of it,'' Mr. Levine said. That holistic approach prompted his earlier immersions in the works of Berg, Mahler and Ives.
 ''If I was very excited by the first piece, then I wanted to see what the range and spectrum was in the rest of the pieces,'' Mr. Levine said. ''And also I figured that if I knew what the whole picture was, it would give me more insight into properly interpreting one work.''
 Mr. Levine is certainly not Mr. Wuorinen's sole champion. In April the Miller Theater at Columbia University will offer the premiere of ''Spin 5,'' a work it commissioned for the violinist Jennifer Koh. Now in the planning stages are works for the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, the pianist Anne-Marie McDermott, the Brentano String Quartet with the pianist Peter Serkin, and the New York New Music Ensemble.
 Even so Mr. Levine is precisely the kind of artistic opinion leader whose prominence might persuade organizations and audiences alike to reconsider composers whose worth has been widely questioned in recent decades: not only Mr. Wuorinen but also Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter and even the father of them all, Arnold Schoenberg. Such conversions do not occur overnight. Mr. Levine has been working patiently and persistently over several seasons, his faith seemingly unshakable. ''Charles writes a quantity of music that is absolutely astonishing, which is only possible because of his extraordinary gift and talent,'' Mr. Levine said. ''I've never seen anyone whose result is more enthusiastic and beautiful, but I think an audience that wants to get that on one hearing is going to have a difficult time. I try to tell them that what they need to do is, don't have a fight with the piece on the first hearing. Just relax and listen. If you think there's nothing there for you, O.K. But if you find something that makes you curious or engaged, then work out a way to hear the piece again as soon as possible, and see whether it starts to take hold.''
 It helps that a steady stream of Mr. Wuorinen's music has appeared on CD lately. Definitive recordings of his chamber music, recorded in the 1990s by the Group for Contemporary Music and originally issued by Koch International Classics, have been reissued recently on Naxos, a budget label with global distribution. During the same weekend that the Met Orchestra gave the premiere of ''Theologoumenon'' Mr. Wuorinen supervised a new recording of songs and chamber works that will be issued on Naxos.
 Recordings of large-scale pieces like the ones Mr. Levine has championed have been harder to come by. But there is cause for hope.
 ''We have media agreements in Boston which will allow us to do this properly,'' Mr. Levine said. ''By 'properly,' I mean not that great rarity when we could put a symphony orchestra in the studio. But we can keep improving our live performances and the way they're recorded, and make available in all kinds of ways recordings of live things.''
 Mr. Levine suggests that the interest andenthusiasm expressed in letters to the orchestra from audience members justify his efforts on behalf of Mr. Wuorinen and his ilk.
 ''In Boston it works very well, because the public is so enthusiastic and so supportive of the orchestra and generally so knowledgeable,'' he said. ''Even though you always get a handful of letters from people who don't like X or Y, you get four letters from people who either love it or respect it or are glad the orchestra had a chance to do it for them. I think Charles is not going to be subject to what's fashionable. In the long run, as people hear it and play it, some of those pieces will stay there and lead the way to others.''
 Mr. Levine may be an anomaly among veteran performers, but Mr. Wuorinen takes heart in what he sees as a steady stream of young musicians who are following his lead.
 ''I've been active in this profession for more than 50 years, so I've seen a lot of changes,'' he said. ''But that's not one of them. As far as I can see, there are the same number of players with the same level of enthusiasm and commitment when they are young. And it isn't the development department, it isn't the marketing department and it isn't the management that determine what happens to music. It's the composers and the performers. If the performers stop caring about real music, then it's over. But I don't see any sign of that.''

HEADLINE: A New Castro?

BYLINE: By David Rieff. 
David Rieff is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
Policy analysts and pundits have been predicting for some time that the so-called unipolar moment, in which the United States stands unchallenged as the sole superpower, will soon come to an end. The debacle in Iraq has hastened this reckoning and sharpened the anxieties about America's role in the world -- perhaps especially among those who believe that the United States is a benign hegemon and that the real choice is between a Pax Americana and anarchy. But it is the recent conduct of Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's firebrand president, that offers the starkest evidence yet of the changed circumstances that American policy makers are starting to confront around the world.
In many ways, Chavez is an unlikely figure to assume the mantle of leadership of this brewing, if slow-burning and incoherent, global revolt. A paratroop officer who instigated a failed coup attempt against the corrupt government of Carlos Andres Perez in 1992, Chavez would seem to conform more to the Latin American stereotype of the military man turned populist (Juan Peron of Argentina being the prototypical example) than to that of a world revolutionary a la Fidel Castro. 
 As his hold on power has tightened, however, Chavez's rhetoric has increasingly embraced the most ossified traditions of left-wing sectarianism. Echoing Che Guevara's insistence that the Cuban revolution was creating a ''new man,'' Chavez has spoken of what he calls his Bolivaran revolution inaugurating the ''moral regeneration'' of Latin America. He has compared his own regime with the Paris Commune, and boasted of sending a copy of ''Das Kapital'' to the bishop of Caracas. In speeches, he invokes the tutelary idols of the antiglobalization left -- Noam Chomsky (whom he cited in a speech at the United Nations); Pierre Bourdieu, the French social theorist; and Antonio Negri, the erstwhile theorist of the Italian Red Brigades. Such rhetoric is commonplace at antiglobalization events like the annual World Social Forum but not in the public declarations of heads of state.
 Now Chavez's deeds have begun to catch up with his rhetoric. Re-elected overwhelmingly to a second term in December, Chavez subsequently announced that he would consider nationalizing, among other things, the assets of some foreign oil companies and the largest phone company, which is partly owned by Verizon. 
 To non-Latin Americans, these statements seem incomprehensible. And given Chavez's outlandish rhetoric, it is tempting to dismiss him as a madman -- as many in Washington were doing until quite recently. After all, Chavez had endorsed the theory that the attacks of 9/11 were planned and carried out by the Bush administration as pretext for going to war. And he has repeatedly praised Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, making five visits to Iran -- visits that President Ahmadinejad reciprocated with a recent tour of Latin America that began in Caracas. 
 The general sense that Chavez must be unhinged derives even more, perhaps, from his enthusiastic support of a Soviet-style command economy. He rejects out of hand what has become the received wisdom of our time, which is that every country, like it or not, must participate in a globalized world economy. But Chavez declares that he is going to construct a socialist Venezuela in a socialist Latin America, globalization be damned. To many, this seems as quixotic as trying to bring back feudalism and the divine right of kings.
 In moving from rhetoric to action, Chavez may indeed have set the stage for the end of his rule. But the Chavez phenomenon should not be dismissed. Not only is he still immensely popular within Venezuela, but he also has become an iconic figure for many people across the world who see the United States as the principal threat to world peace, not its benevolent guarantor. In fact, he has come to play the same role in 2007 that Fidel Castro played in 1967. Perhaps, globalization or no globalization, the world has changed less than most people thought.
 Of course, it is anything but clear that communism in Cuba will survive the death of Castro. Indeed, Cuba hangs on economically only because Venezuela provides it with subsidized oil in much the way the Soviet Union did before it collapsed. At the same time, however, the left-wing surge throughout Latin America continues unabated. Ecuador's new president, Rafael Correa, joins not only Chavez but also Evo Morales of Bolivia and Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua. It's significant that President Ahmadinejad -- who, it should be noted, is not a Socialist or particularly hostile to capitalism of the crony kind -- met with all of them. More significant still is that all these men were swept into power by an electorate for whom globalization is an epithet, not the collective economic destiny of humanity in the 21st century.
 In all likelihood, the chances of a lasting unipolar world were always slight. History teaches that any time one power predominates, a coalition forms to oppose it. Many people expected such a coalition to be led by China (American naval war planners still do). But the coalition that seems to be arising first as an ''antiprinciple'' to U.S. power is one that unites a Castroite Latin American left, hard-line Shiite parties like Hezbollah, Iran and at least some extreme elements of the antiglobalization movement. Note that at Hezbollah's so-called victory rally in Beirut after the summer war with Israel, many participants held up placards with Chavez's face pictured alongside that of Sheik Nasrallah. It is the oldest of foreign-policy instincts, after all, to hold that the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
 Perhaps we were kidding ourselves when we imagined that when Castro died, the yearning in many parts of the world for a figure like Castro would die as well. If Hugo Chavez proves nothing else, it is that such dreams are alive and well.

HEADLINE: Jets Along the Hudson

 BODY:
Turning Stewart International Airport in New Windsor into the New York metropolitan area's fourth major air hub is a bold proposition that sets the mind racing at the grand possibilities, though it can also prompt a sinking feeling when one remembers the many ways that big ideas can fall flat. 
 For now, though, things look far more promising than ominous. Gov. Eliot Spitzer was elected on a platform of change and with ambitious promises to bring jobs and growth upstate. A plan that would ease chronic delays and congestion at Newark, LaGuardia and Kennedy airports while stimulating economic growth in the Hudson Valley is a natural fit for the Spitzer agenda.
The idea of expanding Stewart Airport has been talked about for years, but went nowhere in the Pataki administration. New Yorkers are lucky that the opportunity lingered long enough to be seized last week by the Port Authority, which plans to acquire the airport lease from the British company that put it up for sale last year.
 Stewart International is a fancy name for what is now a sleepy hub 60 miles north of New York City. But the site, a former Air Force base, is bigger than Newark International. It is near two interstate highways, the New York State Thruway and I-84, and the Metro-North railroad. While Stewart handles only a few hundred thousand passengers a year, the Port Authority expects that it could serve more than three million a year in about five years. Most of these would be travelers living north and west of New York City, which would mean huge relief for the people and planes now using the three big-city airports, which have reached the bursting point and cannot expand any more.
 Stewart's vast promise carries many perils. In nearby Newburgh, the economic activity spurred by the airport can be seen in a profusion of big-box stores and strip malls. Growth is clearly better than stagnation, but the Hudson Valley region needs to manage its growth wisely, with particular attention to how an expanded airport might strain the transportation grid and encourage the deadly spread of sprawl. 
 Governor Spitzer wisely couples the words ''smart growth'' with his calls for spurring economic development. These principles -- which envision sensible, human-scale development not fatally wedded to the automobile -- must apply to the changes envisioned in New Windsor.
 As Ned Sullivan of the environmental group Scenic Hudson has warned in these pages, the unmatched beauty and peacefulness of the Hudson River valley are more than a precious aesthetic resource. They are the region's economic mainstay. As long as it is done carefully, Stewart International Airport should be able to expand to its potential as a vital regional transportation hub, linked to the metropolitan grid by improved rail service and existing in harmony with its neighbors.

HEADLINE: The Long Road to Energy Independence 

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
President Bush never used the phrase ''energy independence'' in his State of the Union address last week, and it is just as well. His program for cutting gasoline demand is ambitious in scope, but modest in effect, according to experts. 
 The reason is that the United States has fallen down a very deep well, and it's hard to get out. Last year, the United States imported 60 percent of the oil it consumed. If, as Mr. Bush proposes, we cut gasoline consumption 20 percent by 2017 -- about 2.1 million barrels a day -- then the share of oil imported will fall only by 4 or 5 percentage points.
 In fact, the government expects the share of imported oil to fall anyway, to less than 56 percent, because of a rise in domestic production, mostly from the Gulf Coast. 
 Domestic production has fallen sharply since the mid-1970s, but the Energy Information Administration, which is part of the Energy Department, expects production to rise to almost six million barrels a day by 2017, up from a little over five million barrels a day now. 
 Mr. Bush is also proposing an increase in fuel-economy standards and an increase in the production of ethanol and other gasoline substitutes, hoping to keep oil consumption relatively steady. Without such intervention, oil consumption is forecast to rise to just over 23 million barrels a day in 2017, from nearly 21 million barrels a day today.
 ''It's an enormous challenge,'' said John Felmy, the chief economist of the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's main trade association. 
 Production of ethanol from corn has already put pressure on food prices, according to some agriculture experts, but Mr. Bush's plan involves tripling the production of corn ethanol, and making huge amounts of ethanol from cellulose, which is not now done commercially. 
 Integrating that much ethanol into the fuel supply will involve many more rail-tanker cars or trucks, because ethanol cannot be shipped in conventional pipelines. In addition, the gasoline formula with which it is mixed has to be changed, or the mixture evaporates too easily, causing air pollution.
 The actual amount of ethanol produced will depend on what is technically feasible and on the price of oil. But at the rate of change suggested by the Bush plan, energy independence is about a century away.

HEADLINE: The Budget Illusion

 BODY:
In the State of the Union speech, President Bush said that the budget deficit had been cut in half from 2004 to 2006. Not quite. The deficit declined, but not by half, from $412 billion to $248 billion. If you measure it as a percentage of the economy, Mr. Bush was off by an amount equal to about $15 billion. 
 Then, Mr. Bush greatly compounded his otherwise modest exaggeration by taking credit for the reduction, when the deficit really fell despite his policies, not because of them. The distinction is crucial, to understand both the current mess -- in which debt is mounting just as huge obligations are coming due for Medicare and Social Security -- and how best to get out of it.
The drop in the deficit over the past few years was due largely to the cyclical recovery from the earlier recession, and to a boost in revenue when temporary business tax cuts expired after 2004. 
 Mr. Bush, meanwhile, has pursued a single-minded strategy of spending more while slashing taxes. That is the opposite of deficit reduction; it has made the budget hole deeper than it would have been. Still, Mr. Bush wants you to believe that tax cuts caused the economic recovery, and thus the budget improvement. If you follow that logic, the key to continued improvement would be continued tax cuts, and that is just what Mr. Bush called for last week. He conjured a bright future in which the deficit disappears after he leaves office, without anyone ever having to raise taxes. 
 That was the speech, and then there is reality, which came knocking within days when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office released its annual 10-year budget outlook. The outlook is for a cumulative deficit of $2.9 trillion to $3.4 trillion -- about $300 billion a year -- if, as Mr. Bush wishes, the tax cuts are extended beyond their scheduled expiration in 2010 and tax relief continues for Americans wrongly afflicted by the alternative minimum tax. In arriving at its estimate, the budget agency also assumed that costs for the war in Iraq would start going down next year, an assumption that, if proved wrong, would result in even higher deficits. 
 In the absence of overt tax increases, that leaves Mr. Bush only three ways to erase the deficit. He would have to make pie-in-the-sky assumptions of revenue growth, which would be dicey in any event, but folly at a time when the economy is slowing. He would have to renege on his pledge to protect taxpayers from the alternative minimum tax, a huge backdoor tax increase. Or he would have to persuade lawmakers to make cuts in spending even more draconian than those already dodged by the previous Republican-controlled Congress. 
 Fortunately, such cuts are necessary only if one accepts Mr. Bush's premise that taxes must never rise under any circumstances. That is clearly a false premise. Mr. Bush's tax cuts should largely be allowed to expire. Facing that truth is not a fiscal challenge, it's a political one. 
 Mr. Bush will not meet it. But a future president and Congress will have to.

HEADLINE: Crunch Time for the Tunnel 

 BODY:
The proposed New Jersey to Manhattan commuter rail tunnel, widely regarded as vital to the economy of both New York and New Jersey, is moving into a critical period that could decide whether or not it actually gets built. 
 Largely because of the efforts of New Jersey Transit director George Warrington, who has announced his intention to step down at the end of March, the massive project has blossomed beyond being merely a dream of transportation planners and New Jersey cheerleaders. Officials in New York now support it and want to start construction in 2009.
And just this month, a key federal agency approved a draft of the tunnel's environmental impact statement, an essential step for getting federal funds. 
 But there are major hurdles to surmount during the next two years. The deficit-plagued federal government will have to come up with up to half of the $7.2 billion estimated cost. And even though the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has pledged $2 billion, New Jersey, which has its own budget problems, may have to come up with more than the $500-million it has promised. And even that may not be enough. 
 Since Mr. Warrington will not be around to keep the pressure on, there's a risk that some of this necessary funding may dry up or that other smaller, less important pet projects of various politicians may drain off money. It is imperative that New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, a strong supporter of the tunnel, name a successor with the same expertise and sense of commitment that Mr. Warrington has displayed. 
 The need for the tunnel is enormous. Currently, a 96-year-old Amtrak-owned tunnel with two tracks is the only rail link under the Hudson River. Serving both Amtrak and New Jersey Transit trains, the link carries 45,000 passengers each peak period when 24 trains an hour are squeezed through the tunnel. If there is a breakdown, rail transportation between New Jersey and Manhattan stops. The new tunnel, which would end under 34th Street on Manhattan's West Side, would provide essential backup and double the number of trains that could enter and exit Manhattan from New Jersey. 
 Besides improved service for commuters from west of the Hudson, the new tunnel is essential for New York City's economy, which is expected to become increasingly dependent on workers from New Jersey, Rockland and Orange counties in New York, and even Pennsylvania, as the years go by. 
 It is this argument that Mr. Warrington used to get Gov. Eliot Spitzer, Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Sen. Hillary Clinton, Sen. Charles Schumer and other key New York city and state officials behind the project. 
 And it is this argument, together with the importance of a healthy New York-New Jersey metropolitan area to the economy of the entire nation, that Mr. Warrington's successor will have to make in Washington to get the needed federal money. 
 For the tunnel to become a reality, New Jersey Transit will need one of the most able and persuasive mass transit directors in the country.

HEADLINE: In Iowa, Clinton Tells Crowd She Is Ready for Battle

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

DATELINE: DES MOINES, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton began her presidential campaign road show on Saturday by making an appeal along gender lines, telling a crowd of 2,800 Iowans that she faced a ''double standard'' as a female candidate, yet hoped voters would look past ''stories about my clothes and hair'' to help her make history.
 Yet Mrs. Clinton also portrayed herself as something of a bare-knuckled fighter on her inaugural trip as a candidate to Iowa, the first of the first-in-the-nation nominating caucuses. Speaking to another group of Democrats on Saturday, she said she had learned from the failed 2004 presidential campaign of Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts that a candidate always had to respond to attacks.
''When you're attacked, you have to deck your opponents,'' Mrs. Clinton said to some laughter and applause. ''You can count on me to stand my ground and fight back.'' 
 And after only touching on the Iraq war for most of the day -- only a couple of Iowans brought it up with her -- Mrs. Clinton criticized the Bush administration's war policy during a party at a home in Cedar Rapids Saturday night, seeking to show her tougher side and reach out to antiwar Democrats.
 ''I know how difficult the last six years have been, particularly because of this president's foreign policy, his preemptive war in Iraq, his management of the war and his stubborn refusal to change course,'' she said. ''We have to get the balance right between defending our country and deterring those who wish us ill, as they still do, and ending the alienation toward us in the rest of the world.''
 ''I know there are people who either say or wonder, Would we ever elect a woman president? And I don't think we'll know until we try -- and I'm going to try, and I'm going to try with your help,'' Mrs. Clinton said to some of her loudest applause. ''We are good at breaking barriers and going places where no one has gone before.''
 ''There will be more stories about my clothes and hair than some of the people running against me,'' she said.
 ''I'm going to be asking people to vote for me based on my entire life and experience,'' said Mrs. Clinton, who walked around a stage surrounded by people, with a microphone affixed to the lapel of her pantsuit. ''The fact that I'm a woman, the fact that I'm a mom, is part of who I am.''
 To which a woman in the audience shouted, ''You go, girl!''
 In this, the first of what her advisers said would be many visits to Iowa, she sought to re-introduce herself as a native Midwesterner with a down-home political message that was emblazoned on colorful banners: ''Let the conversation begin!''
 ''I want to have this as a one-on-one conversation: just you and me,'' she said, and after pausing a beat, added, ''and several hundreds of national press.''
 She bemoaned skyrocketing pay for corporate chief executives, stagnant wages and the rising costs of health care, education and energy. She also said she wanted tougher trade agreements that protected the worker's place in the economy.
 ''There's something wrong when you have more bankruptcies in America last year than college graduates,'' she said.
 The only real bump in the day came when MSNBC broadcast Mrs. Clinton singing the national anthem before the town hall-style meeting began; her voice was, like that of many Americans, off-key, and the moment was quickly captured for posterity on YouTube.
 Mrs. Clinton was introduced by Representative Leonard L. Boswell, who drew an ovation when he called her ''a great first lady.'' He said that the day had meaning for women in his family and, surely, many women in the audience.
 ''You can do it -- you can do it,'' Mr. Boswell said.
 Several women asked Mrs. Clinton about the challenges of running and winning as a woman and about the roles that women play in society.
 There was only one question from an audience member about Iraq, and it was a benign inquiry about her 2002 vote authorizing military action, which remains controversial with many liberals. Yet at an earlier, smaller event with Democrats, she said she took responsibility for her vote, but also said the president misused the authority to go to war. And at the party at the Cedar Rapids home on Saturday night, she ripped Mr. Bush's handling of the war and said one problem in the White House was that no one had challenged him or other leaders over the war and other policies.
 Mrs. Clinton ended up focusing on her support for veterans' benefits and health care. 
 Most of the people who turned out wore ''Hillary'' buttons or held campaign signs, and several said in interviews that they were true believers in the Clinton candidacy.
 ''I've been a longtime fan of Hillary; I used to canvass for environmental causes, and I know she's a friend of the New York environment,'' said Jessica Anderson of Centerville, Iowa.
 Ms. Anderson said she was not certain that Mrs. Clinton could win, adding that some Democrats were skeptical that a woman could handle the pressure of being commander in chief.
 ''If she doesn't get elected, it's because of sexism -- that's it,'' Ms. Anderson said.
 Mrs. Clinton spent Saturday morning attending the Iowa Democratic Party's Central Committee meeting. She spoke there about the lessons from Mr. Kerry's campaign; in response to other questions, she reiterated her support for repealing the ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy on gay men and lesbians in the military enacted during her husband's administration. 
 She also said thousands of patriotic Americans had been discharged. ''That to me does not make sense,'' she said.
 On Friday night, Mrs. Clinton had dinner in Des Moines at the home of a leading Democrat, Andrea McGuire, and was joined by several other influential party members: Mr. Boswell; the state Senate Democratic leader, Michael E. Gronstal; and Bonnie Campbell, the former state attorney general, among others.
 Mrs. Clinton had not visited Iowa since 2003, a calculated decision, her advisers said, to deny the news media one more reason to write about any presidential bid. Early polls have shown her trailing John Edwards, the former senator of North Carolina, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois and Tom Vilsack, the former governor of Iowa, each of whom have campaigned here recently.

HEADLINE: SAUDI OFFICIALS SEEK TO TEMPER THE PRICE OF OIL

BYLINE: BY JAD MOUAWAD; Jim Rutenberg contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia, which benefited immensely from record oil prices last year, has sent signals in the past two weeks that it is committed to keeping oil at around $50 a barrel -- down $27 a barrel from the summer peak that shook consumers across the developed world. 
 The indications came in typically cryptic fashion for the oil-rich kingdom. In Tokyo last week, Ali al-Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, said Saudi Arabia's policy was to maintain ''moderate prices.'' The previous week, on a stop in New Delhi, he effectively put his veto on an emergency meeting of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to prop up prices after oil briefly dropped below $50 a barrel, the lowest level in nearly two years.
The events that propelled oil prices above $77 a barrel last July, then dragged them down again, were beyond the control of any single producer. Still, Saudi Arabia, which is by far the largest oil producer within OPEC and sets the cartel's agenda, is seeking to avoid a repeat of the dramatic rise in prices while trying to put a floor beneath them. 
 Nowhere was last summer's spike in oil prices felt more profoundly than in the United States. As gasoline rose above $3 a gallon, consumers cut their spending elsewhere, tamping down profits in retail, travel and other industries. United States automakers were devastated as consumers fled from large vehicles to smaller ones, which have historically been the specialty of the Japanese; on Thursday, Ford said that 2006 had been the worst year in its history.
 The recent slide back to $50 a barrel for oil -- which translates to about $2 for a gallon of gasoline -- has eased the pressure on the domestic economy, quieting talk that oil prices and the declining housing market would lead to a recession. 
 The Saudis appear to be rediscovering that painfully high energy prices take a profound toll on the global economy, which in turn reduces demand for their oil. But other motives seem to be at work, too, including the Saudis' desire to restrain Iran's ambitions in the region. 
 How much influence the United States has exerted is an open question. Vice President Dick Cheney met with King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in Riyadh in November, but his office would not say if oil was discussed. The White House has been supportive of Saudi energy policy, and President Bush and his father are close with Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi national security minister and former ambassador to Washington.
 Although Saudi officials say their oil policy is based on market considerations and not political ones, the meeting in November led to renewed speculation that the kingdom might be tempted to dry out Iran's ambitions by pushing oil prices down. Prices have already been falling because of mild weather and slowing demand.
 Prices at $50 to $55 a barrel are just about right for the Saudis, according to Saudi energy officials -- not too high to hurt the global economy, not too low to hurt their own economy. Last year's record highs meant that the growth in global oil demand slowed to 1 percent in 2006, compared with a 4 percent increase at its peak in 2004. 
 But 2006 was not the first reminder for the Saudis that too-high prices can backfire. The oil shocks of the 1970s and 1980s also set off a scramble for gas-sipping cars and a brief push to wean the West from its oil dependency. In recent months, the higher prices have rekindled America's quest for alternatives and propelled energy security to the top of the agenda in the United States and Europe. 
 Even President Bush, who began his presidency emphasizing the need to increase domestic oil production rather than cutting consumption, called for a reduction in gasoline use over the next decade in last week's State of the Union address.
 High prices have also emboldened rivals within OPEC, among them Iran and Venezuela, which have used their oil revenue to prop up their governments and export their more radical agendas. Saudi Arabia has worked cooperatively with Iran since the late 1990s, when oil producers were panicked by the decline of prices to around $10 a barrel. More recently, Iran has favored rising prices over the moderation that Saudi Arabia seeks. Venezuela also tends to favor higher prices but wields less political influence in the cartel. 
 ''High prices are not in the interest of Saudi Arabia,'' said Sadek Boussena, a former OPEC president from Algeria. ''We've all seen what $70 does: it attracts alternatives, it reduces demand. On the other hand, I don't think the Saudis want oil below $50. They need the revenue.''
 The Bush administration has repeatedly acknowledged Saudi Arabia's efforts in trying to moderate prices. ''Buyers and sellers have a common interest in maintaining reasonable prices for oil,'' Samuel Bodman, the energy secretary, said in October.
 There is no set formula for setting oil prices. In the 1980s, the market settled on around $18 a barrel as a fair price. In the 1990s, it was ratcheted up to $22 to $25 a barrel. Recently, oil producers have realized they can charge twice that amount, although consuming nations complain that the price is too high.
 Mr. Naimi, the Saudi oil minister, borrowing the manner of a careful central banker, is rarely explicit about his plans. His every word is dissected by legions of analysts for the slightest hint of an inflection in policy. 
 Sometimes, the uncertainty gives rise to more conspiratorial theories. Oil traders have been buzzing in recent weeks about whether Saudi Arabia was seeking to depress oil markets in hopes of crippling Iran's economy, as a Saudi analyst -- albeit not one from the government -- suggested late last year in an opinion article in The Washington Post. The Saudis quickly dismissed the claim, but given the tensions in the Middle East, oil and politics remain closely linked.
 ''It is difficult to work out what the Saudis really want, since they never say things explicitly,'' said Leo Drollas, the chief economist at the Center for Global Energy Studies, a London-based research group founded by Sheik Ahmed Zaki Yamani, a former Saudi oil minister. Sometimes, he said, ''you have to read between the lines.''
 The Saudi government does not disclose what oil price it uses when it builds its budget, but analysts at Samba Financial Group, a bank in Saudi Arabia, say they believe the price is $42 a barrel for 2007, with oil production at about 9 million barrels a day. With oil averaging $66 a barrel last year, the kingdom recorded a budget surplus of nearly $71 billion, Samba said, five times more than in 2005.
 Saudi officials repeatedly point out that they do not set the price of oil on international commodity markets -- they point the finger at hedge funds and other speculative traders for the heightened volatility in recent years. Nor, they say, do they run their oil industry with political considerations in mind. 
 Mr. Naimi has led the ascent of oil prices since 2000 and managed his various partners within OPEC toward better discipline within the cartel. Last fall, under Saudi stewardship, OPEC members twice agreed to cut their output to prevent prices from falling too steeply.
 More than any specific target, the Saudis have always sought stability in oil prices. But stability may prove just as elusive this year as it did last year, given how vulnerable global oil supplies remain to the vagaries of the weather as well as political turmoil in the Middle East and Africa.
 Although OPEC's 12 members decide by unanimous votes whether to increase oil production -- which lowers prices by making supply more plentiful -- consumer pressures ultimately hold sway, and an extremely cold winterfollowed by a very hot summer could override whatever price goals the Saudis have set.
 Not everyone is reading the Saudis' recent public signals -- scant as they are -- in the same way. ''The Saudi policy has not changed,'' said Roger Diwan, an energy analyst at PFC Energy. The Saudis, he said, have ''led the way in managing the market. They showed leadership in OPEC.''
 But Amy Myers Jaffe, the associate director of Rice University's energy program, said she thought that Saudi policy had shifted, backing away from a defense of higher prices. 
 ''The debate in Saudi Arabia is about what is the right strategy, where demand is headed, and what is the right amount of investments,'' she said. ''And that's a very tough question.''

HEADLINE: On Iran, Bush Confronts Haunting Echoes of Iraq

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
As President Bush and his aides calibrate how directly to confront Iran, they are discovering that both their words and their strategy are haunted by the echoes of four years ago -- when their warnings of terrorist activity and nuclear ambitions were clearly a prelude to war.
 This time, they insist, it is different.
''We're not looking for a fight with Iran,'' R. Nicholas Burns, the under secretary of state for policy and the chief negotiator on Iranian issues, said in an interview on Friday evening, just a few hours after Mr. Bush had repeated his warnings to Iran to halt ''killing our soldiers'' and to stop its drive for nuclear fuel.
 Mr. Burns, citing the president's words, insisted that Washington was committed to ''a diplomatic path'' -- even as it executed a far more aggressive strategy, seizing Iranians in Iraq and attempting to starve Iran of the money it needs to revitalize a precious asset, its oil industry. 
 Mr. Burns argues that those are defensive steps that are not intended to provoke Iran, though there has been a vigorous behind-the-scenes debate in the administration over whether the more aggressive policy could provoke Iran to strike back. The State Department has tended to counsel caution, while some more hawkish aides in the Pentagon and the White House say the increase in American forces in Iraq could be neutered unless the American military forcefully pushes back against the Iranian aid to the militias. 
 To many in Washington, especially Mr. Bush's Democratic critics, the new approach to Iran has all the hallmarks of an administration once again spoiling for a fight. 
 Some see an attempt to create a diversion, focusing the country's attention away from a war gone bad in Iraq, and toward a country that has exploited America's troubles to expand its influence. Others suspect an effort to shift the blame for the spiraling chaos in Iraq, as a steady flow of officials, from the C.I.A. director to the new secretary of defense, cite intelligence that Iranians are smuggling into Iraq sophisticated explosive devices and detailed plans to wipe out Sunni neighborhoods. So far, they have disclosed no evidence. Next week, American military officials are expected to make their most comprehensive case -- based on materials seized in recent raids -- that Iran's elite Quds force is behind many of the most lethal attacks.
 But as they present their evidence, some Bush administration officials concede they are confronting the bitter legacy of their prewar distortions of the intelligence in Iraq. When speaking under the condition of anonymity, they say the administration's credibility has been deeply damaged, which would cast doubt on any attempt by Mr. Bush, for example, to back up his claim that Iran's uranium enrichment program is intended for bomb production. 
 ''It's never stated explicitly, but clearly we can't make the case about Iran's intentions,'' said a senior strategist for the Bush administration who joined it long after evidence surfaced that Iraq had none of the illicit weapons that the administration cited as a reason to go to war. 
 It has not helped that even as the administration is making its case against Iran, the perjury trial of I. Lewis Libby Jr., Vice President Dick Cheney's former chief of staff, was opening just a few blocks away.
 The early testimony in that trial has laid bare again how Mr. Cheney, among others, carefully selected intelligence for use in a political campaign to make the case against Iraq. Now, several years later, the administration is paying the price in dealing with a country whose ability to project power and to build a sophisticated nuclear program is far greater than Saddam Hussein's was in 2003.
 The administration does not have definitive evidence that Iran is moving toward producing a nuclear bomb, but next week it will unveil what officials say is evidence of Iran's meddling in Iraq.
 In interviews over the past several weeks, officials from the Pentagon to the State Department to the White House insist that Mr. Bush's goal in Iran is not to depose a government, Iraq-style, but rather to throw a series of brushback pitches. 
 Officials familiar with the intelligence prepared for Mr. Bush say American assessments conclude that Iran sees itself at the head of an alliance to drive the United States out of Iraq, and ultimately out of the Middle East. Other briefings have included assessments that Russia and China will never join meaningful economic sanctions against a country that they do business with, so if Mr. Bush wants to apply military and economic pressure, he must do so outside the United Nations.
 One result was a strategy that Mr. Bush approved in the fall to push back on all fronts and to force Iran to recalculate what administration officials call its cost-benefit analysis for challenging the United States. The effort to stop European and Japanese banks from lending money to Iran's oil sector is part of the equation. So is pushing down the price of oil, though administration officials grow silent when asked whether Mr. Cheney or others have discussed with Saudi Arabia the benefits of pumping enough oil to push the price down and deprive Iran of revenues. 
 But it is the military component of the strategy that carries the biggest risks. Two aircraft carriers and their accompanying battle groups were sent into the Persian Gulf, a senior military official said, ''to remind the Iranians that we can focus on them, too.'' American military forces in Iraq were authorized to move against Iranian operatives, though it is unclear what kind of evidence is needed, if any, that they are conspiring against American forces before military action is authorized. 
 American officials describe those measures as purely defensive. ''We are definitely looking to protect our interests in the gulf, in Iraq itself, and to protect the lives of our soldiers,'' said Mr. Burns, who insisted that there was no effort to stop Iran from ordinary exchanges with Iraq. 
 Yet administration officials clearly worry that the Iranians may not back down, and that a confrontation could build up -- especially if a midlevel American commander or a member of Iran's military or paramilitary forces in Iraq miscalculated. Both Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates have warned against that risk, officials say.
 Administration officials say that while all of Mr. Bush's advisers have signed on to the strategy of more forceful confrontation with Tehran, there is considerable debate about how far to push it. Some Iran experts at the State Department have warned that encounters between Americans and Iranians inside Iraq could strengthen the hand of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad by allowing him to change the subject from his failure to produce jobs and the rising cost of nuclear defiance. 
 Over the longer run, there is a continuing debate about whether military action may some day be necessary to set back Iran's nuclear activities. For now American officials say they do not believe they have a good set of targets or the ability to contain Iran's reaction. ''It's not a question of ideology,'' one senior military official said, refusing to talk on the record about military planning. ''We simply don't have the forces to deal with the reaction. They're busy.''
 At the Pentagon, military officials say there are still arguments over the rules for confronting Iranian operatives. Are they legitimate targets simply because they are identified as part of Iran's military? Or do American forces need evidence that they are importing weapons or sowing chaos? Publicly, officials say the answers to those questions are classified. Privately, a senior official said, ''It's all still a matter of debate.'' 
 In coming weeks, administration officials say, more escalation is likely. The Iranians have told the International Atomic Energy Agency that they will announce in February that they are beginning industrial-scale efforts to produce uranium. It will probably be years before they can produce enough fuel for a bomb.
 But the debate over whether the United States should stick to diplomacy or take more forceful action is bound to begin right away, and will sound familiar. Democrats, even while accusing the administration of failing to engage with Iran, are positioning themselves to sound tough. 
 ''To ensure that Iran never gets nuclear weapons, we need to keep all options on the table,'' former Senator John Edwards recently told an Israeli security conference. ''Let me reiterate -- all options.'' 
 For Mr. Bush, this is not only about options but about legacy. Already bloodied in Iraq, he will come under increasing pressure to show that he has not left the United States weakened in the Middle East. He does not want to be remembered for leaving Iran more powerful than he found it when he came to office.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Is Sounding More Like a Candidate

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N. H., Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Rudolph W. Giuliani sounded nearer than ever to being a presidential candidate on Saturday, repeatedly talking about the prospect of running, and inviting voters to judge him by his record as mayor of New York City.
 Though he has long been thought to be a presidential contender, he has fallen behind other candidates in declaring his intention, and the language he used on Saturday, while suggesting a run, also contained built-in escape hatches. Speaking to a convention of the New Hampshire Republican Party, he advised the delegates on ''what you should look for in whatever decision you make in presidential primaries,'' and added, ''when I promise you things, if I do, when I do, as I do, I'll promise them because I've done them before.''
He returned to that theme moments later, and as he has done in recent days, drew a direct analogy between fighting crime in his home city and establishing peace in Iraq. 
 ''When I say to you that we should reduce taxes to stimulate the economy, I'll say it to you because I did it and I saw it work,'' he said. ''When I say we have to bring peace and security as sort of the beginning of anything, whether it's in Baghdad or in other parts of the world or here at home, I'll say that to you because I saw that happen in New York, and I made it happen. I did it.''
 In his first trip since last fall to the state that holds the earliest presidential primary, Mr. Giuliani stepped closer than he has before to suggesting that he will run.
 ''Government has got to work in order to allow people to have confidence in it,'' he said. ''And as I look at this, I believe there is something I can do about that.''
 Whether or not he is serious about a campaign, he may need to send such a signal to keep his options open. He has raised money, traveled extensively and put together a more robust organization in recent weeks, but as other candidates enter the race, many Republicans -- and some publications -- have questioned whether he will go through with it.
 On this trip, he met privately with several elected officials, including the mayor of Manchester, Frank Guinta -- the kind of personal courting people here expect, and that other top contenders have done more than Mr. Giuliani has. ''He's going to have to spend a lot more with these people,'' said Senator John E. Sununu.
 When he speaks, Mr. Giuliani normally walks around the stage and does not refer to notes, joking and making matter-of-fact arguments. But Saturday's speech, at the old Palace Theater, was unusually formal for him -- he stayed behind the lectern and worked from notes -- and also more overtly boastful and partisan, and more designed to rouse his audience.
 Mr. Giuliani has taken the politically risky position of supporting President Bush's unpopular decision to send more troops to Iraq, as have the other Republicans who rank highest in early polls, Senator John S. McCain and Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. But for the second time in as many days, Mr. Giuliani cautioned Saturday that the strategy might not work, and that it should not be viewed as the last word in the war.
 ''We hope and we root for and we pray for a successful outcome in Iraq,'' he said. ''But our ultimate victory is not going to be a military victory. Our ultimate victory against terrorism is going to be a victory of ideas.''
 But he stayed away from the divisive social issues that put him at odds with much of his party, like his support of abortion rights and gay civil unions. Some delegates here said they had hoped Mr. Giuliani would explain support his past support for gun controls in New York that would be unpopular here.
 Still, Republican officials here take him very seriously as a presidential contender, based primarily on his reputation for leadership in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks.
 ''I would say his chances are excellent,'' said State Representative John Reagan. ''Everyone knows he has been severely tested.''

HEADLINE: Experts See Peril in Bush Health Proposal

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
With his proposal to uproot a tax break that has been in place for more than 60 years, President Bush has touched off an impassioned debate over the future of the employer-based system that provides health insurance to more than half of all Americans.
 ''Changing the tax code is a vital and necessary step to making health care affordable for more Americans,'' Mr. Bush said in his State of the Union address this week.
Mr. Bush said his proposal would eliminate a bias in the tax code that strongly favored insurance provided by employers over coverage bought by individuals and families outside the workplace.
 Paul Fronstin, director of health research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonpartisan organization, said: ''The president's proposal would mean the end of employer-based benefits as we know them. It gives employers a way out of providing the benefits because their employees could get the same tax break on their own.'' 
 Tony Fratto, a White House spokesman, denied that the president wanted to move people away from the employer-based system and toward the individual insurance market. ''We are seriously agnostic on that,'' he said.
 It might take years for changes to occur. ''Large corporate employers could not immediately terminate their health benefits because there is, at present, no reliable place where employees can get coverage they can afford outside the workplace,'' said Frank B. McArdle, a health policy expert at Hewitt Associates, a benefits consulting firm.
 The economic rationale for Mr. Bush's proposal is that too many people have ''gold-plated, deluxe'' health insurance, which encourages them to use excessive amounts of health care, driving up costs for everyone. 
 Many economists agree. But they doubt that Mr. Bush's proposal would do much to hold down costs or cover more people.
 ''The president's proposal addresses inequities in the tax code that provide an open-ended subsidy for premiums paid by employers,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. ''If your employer does not provide health insurance and you have to buy it on your own, you get no tax benefit at all. The president's plan would eliminate that distinction.''
 But Mr. Reischauer said, ''A glaring problem with the president's plan is that he did not call for any stronger regulation of the individual insurance market.'' In that market as it now exists in most states, insurers can deny coverage or charge higher rates to sick people.
 In their desire to achieve universal coverage, some Democrats have also begun to raise questions about the employer-based system. ''We have to ask ourselves if the employer-based system of health care is still the best way for providing insurance to all Americans,'' said Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, noting that workers frequently changed jobs.
 The Service Employees International Union negotiates with employers to secure health benefits for its members, but the president of the union, Andrew L. Stern, said, ''The current employer-based health care system is not the foundation for 21st-century health care reform.''
 Mr. Bush's proposal differs radically from President Bill Clinton's plan for universal coverage, but experts on health benefits said they were similar in one respect: In an effort to help the uninsured -- about one-sixth of the population -- they would upend the system that covers most Americans.
 The Clinton plan would have provided comprehensive health benefits to 39 million uninsured Americans, with more than $400 billion in new federal spending over 10 years. The White House says the tax changes proposed by Mr. Bush would provide coverage for 3 million to 5 million people at no cost to the government over 10 years.
 Since Mr. Bush took office in 2001, the number of people without insurance has increased by more than 5 million, to 46.6 million, according to the Census Bureau. Administration officials said they hoped to reverse that trend by helping states that offered basic private insurance policies to their residents. To pay for such help, the administration would take federal money from hospitals that serve large numbers of poor people.
 Under Mr. Bush's proposal, employee health benefits would, for the first time, be treated as income and would be subject to income and payroll taxes, just like wages. At the same time, Mr. Bush would create a tax deduction for health insurance of $15,000 for families and $7,500 for individuals. The same deduction would be available to everyone with coverage, regardless of the source or value of the policy.
 A family with coverage worth $18,000 would have to pay taxes on the amount exceeding the $15,000 standard deduction -- $3,000, in this example. 
 Katherine Baicker, a member of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said the proposal would increase taxes for 30 million people with the most generous employer-provided health benefits, unless they ''change their behavior'' and choose less costly coverage. Ms. Baicker said the proposal would cut taxes for more than 100 million people who bought insurance on their own or had employee health benefits worth less than the standard deduction.
 Treasury officials said that under the Bush proposal, an uninsured family of four with an annual income of $60,000 would save $4,545 if it bought coverage in the individual market. By contrast, they said, a family that earns $80,000 and has employer-provided coverage worth $20,000 could see a tax increase of about $1,500.
 Joel D. Kaplan, deputy chief of staff at the White House, acknowledged that the proposal could accelerate the trend of employers' dropping health benefits for employees. But he said more people ''would be able to buy insurance in the individual market,'' so there would be ''a net increase in the number of insured.''
 Politicians and health care providers are skeptical.
 Representative John D. Dingell, the Michigan Democrat who is the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, said, ''The president's proposal would do little to help the uninsured, but would undermine the employer-based system through which 160 million people get coverage.''
 Richard J. Umbdenstock, president of the American Hospital Association, agreed. ''The tax proposal would have the effect of driving people to the small-group insurance market -- a market that has proved unstable,'' Mr. Umbdenstock said. ''For many people, even with a tax break, coverage would remain unaffordable.'' 
 Historically, employers have used benefits as a tool to recruit workers and keep them healthy and productive. 
 R. Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, praised the general direction of the president's proposal but said his members had serious concerns.
 First, Mr. Josten said, the $15,000 cap on tax-free insurance takes no account of wide geographic variation in the cost of health care and insurance. The same package of benefits typically costs more in Boston than in Minneapolis, for example.
 Moreover, Mr. Josten said, a health plan may be expensive because it covers older workers with major medical problems, not because it is ''gold-plated.'' A single mother, working as a low-paid secretary at a law firm, could be pushed into a higher tax bracket because she participates in an $18,000 health plan covering older men who have had heart attacks and expensive surgery, Mr. Josten said.
 Treasury officials acknowledged that some people with costly, comprehensive benefits had modest incomes.
 But deluxe health plans are vanishingfast. In recent years, many workers have found themselves paying more for less comprehensive benefits. From 2000 to 2006, premiums for employer-sponsored coverage rose 87 percent, about four times as fast as workers' earnings, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.

HEADLINE: A Plan to Revive Trade Talks Is Offered at Forum

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 27 

 BODY:
Leading trade ministers on Saturday embraced an unusual game plan for reviving trade talks, saying they would try to hash out details on technical issues, rather than first agreeing on the broad outlines of an accord. 
 During a meeting at the World Economic Forum, officials from 30 countries including the United States, the European Union and emerging markets like India and Brazil vowed to move forward in the Doha round of World Trade Organization talks, which began more than five years ago in the Persian Gulf emirate of Qatar but collapsed in July because of disagreements about farm subsidies and tariff cuts. They hope to reach a deal within a year.
To resuscitate the talks, the ministers endorsed a strategy that is highly unusual in these negotiations, but now appears to offer the only chance to conclude the trade round. Instead of creating a framework for agreement and then working out details on technical issues like tariffs and subsidies later, countries will aim to work out most specifics up front. Then, they will decide whether a final push is warranted at a meeting of all World Trade Organization members in Geneva.
 Pascal Lamy, the organization's director general, said the process would have to achieve a genuine breakthrough in ''months, not quarters,'' for a meeting of all the group's members to occur. Apart from agriculture, it would also have to address tariff cuts for industrial products and services like finance and telecommunications.
 After the Geneva meeting, Mr. Lamy said countries would tackle other, less contentious issues, including simplifying customs procedures, environmental rules and antidumping rules.
 The W.T.O. negotiations would dovetail with a bid by the Bush administration to extend the United States trade negotiating authority that expires on June 30. Next week, President Bush will give two major addresses on economic policy calling on Congress to take that step, American officials said.

RUNNING a storied enterprise like Microsoft -- software heavyweight, geyser of cash, corporate icon -- is about much more than energy and commitment, says Steven A. Ballmer, the company's chief executive. It is all but a calling, an article of faith.
 ''You've got to be very realistic about where you are, but very optimistic about where you can be,'' he said during interviews this month. ''And the day you can't be both of those things, you shouldn't be a leader of a company like Microsoft. You have to believe; you have to believe; you have to believe.''
In the Ballmerian world view, failure is not an option. ''If we don't get it right at first, we'll just keep coming and coming and coming and coming,'' he says.
 For the better part of the last two decades, the prospect of Microsoft coming and coming and coming, relentlessly picking off and then dominating various sectors of the software business, has sent shivers through the ranks of its competitors. Many have fallen by the wayside or changed course to avoid being crushed by one of the most successful and viciously competitive companies of any era. 
 No longer. 
 Competitors once feared and respected Microsoft. Now they simply respect it. And as Microsoft prepares to unveil new versions of its desktop operating system and office programs on Tuesday it finds itself facing emboldened competition, even uncertainty. With the Internet revolution upending business models across a broad swath of industries, Microsoft itself is feeling the heat. The challenges that the company confronts today are different from those of the past, and its market power in the personal computer business matters less than before. 
 More homes and offices are getting wired with high-speed Internet connections, a market-altering shift that is buttressed by a stream of advances in data storage, computer-processing and software. This second generation of Internet technology animates advertising-supported Web services like search, and opens the door to the delivery of online alternatives to Microsoft's popular desktop programs like e-mail, word processors and spreadsheets.
 The consumer rollout this week of new models of Microsoft's mainstay products, Windows and Office, is one that many industry analysts view as the last hurrah of the fading order of computing, dominated by the PC and ruled by Microsoft.
 Google, the search giant, is, of course, the leader of the Web 2.0 wave and may be the most potent competitor Microsoft has ever encountered. But Microsoft faces a variety of nimble, wily and innovative opponents in other markets as well. In video games, it goes up against Sony and Nintendo; in music players, Apple; in corporate software, I.B.M., Oracle and Linux.
 Deciding how to respond to Microsoft's growing host of competitors has fallen to a bullet-domed, hulking, boisterous whirlwind whose friendship with Bill Gates, Microsoft's founder and chairman, dates back to their college days and whose dexterity and acumen will determine Microsoft's fate. Mr. Gates declared last June that he plans to step out of day-to-day work at Microsoft entirely by the middle of next year to become a full-time philanthropist. 
 Mr. Gates says he is confident that he is leaving Microsoft in safe hands. In an e-mail message, he calls Mr. Ballmer ''a great partner and a great friend'' and describes his relationship with Mr. Ballmer as ''one of the greatest business partnerships of all time.''
 Yet earlier victories may not help Microsoft much today. 
 ''The world has changed, and how Microsoft adapts to that change is going to be the test of Steve Ballmer,'' observed Brad Silverberg, a venture capitalist and former senior Microsoft executive. ''He has fundamentally sound judgment, he's a great leader and he's capable of listening and hearing things that are not the way he wished. He has the tools.''
 Others who have worked with Mr. Ballmer over the years have no doubts about his intelligence, persistence and underlying pragmatism. Even so, Microsoft, despite its deep pockets and immense resources -- in fact, precisely because of those vast resources -- has potentially much more to lose in the Internet age than other companies. ''This is every bit as disruptive for Microsoft as it is for others,'' said George F. Colony, the chief executive of Forrester Research, the technology consulting firm. ''The dilemma for Microsoft is that it is a prisoner of its business model, and the fact that it is a gilt-lined prison makes it brutally hard to change.''
 One of the evolutionary laws of business is that success breeds failure; the tactics and habits of earlier triumphs so often leave companies -- even the biggest, most profitable and most admired companies -- unable to adapt. 
 Microsoft faces that quandary today. A huge promotional push will accompany the arrival of Microsoft's gold-mine offerings -- Windows Vista and Office 2007 -- because the desktop operating systems and office software businesses accounted for a majority of Microsoft's $44.28 billion in revenue last year and about 80 percent of its profit. Yet Windows Vista, repeatedly delayed and arriving two years late, comes as the center of gravity in computing shifts increasingly toward the Internet. 
 The PC software business will not wither anytime soon, according to technology analysts and executives, but more and more of the excitement and significant new applications will gravitate to Internet-based software. Since Mr. Ballmer's first full year as chief executive in 2001, Microsoft's revenue has risen 75 percent and its operating profit 40 percent, but its stock price has been flat, reflecting Wall Street's doubts about Microsoft's growth prospects. 
 Yet as Mr. Ballmer navigates this pivotal juncture in his company's 31-year history, he remains a visceral optimist. (He often deploys a favorite Colin Powell quotation: ''Persistent optimism is a force multiplier.'') When asked about his biggest worry for Microsoft's future, he dismisses the notion of worry as ''a funny term,'' as if it were an alien concept. Instead, he speaks of advertising-supported Internet software and services like Google and open-source software like the Linux operating system as ''new business models that we either have to compete with or embrace'' -- and thus rivals worthy of his attention and his ''spare brain cycles.''
 Don't call it worry, but Mr. Ballmer acknowledges that Microsoft's toughest task has been in deciding where to place its bets in new markets or technologies that don't operate by the same rules as its tried-and-true products. ''One of the biggest mistakes I've made over time,'' he acknowledges, ''is not wanting to nurture innovations where I either didn't get the business model or we didn't have it.'' 
 But those days are past, Mr. Ballmer declares, saying that he and Microsoft have learned their lessons. He pointed to Microsoft's Xbox video game console, its Zune music player, Internet search and online advertising as examples of big investments the company is making in businesses that are very different from its lucrative stronghold in PC software. 
 ''I think we've shown more willingness to embrace new models than anyone else in the technology business,'' he asserts. ''Will it be good enough? Let's see.'' 
 THE prevailing image of Mr. Ballmer, 50, is mainly that of a marketing dynamo -- a hyperkinetic, booming orator who can fire up the sales staff and industry partners to labor tirelessly on Microsoft's behalf. He has strained his vocal cords when shouting at sales meetings. Years ago, his gestures became so animated in a meeting with reporters that he cut himself in the face with a fingernail and, bleeding, continued on, extolling the virtues of the latest Microsoft offering.
 Videos on the Web of Mr. Ballmer at large Microsoft gatherings several years ago, when he was heavier, show him bounding across the stage, mostly screaming. In one, he finally comes to the podium to shout to the audience, ''I have four words for you: I love this company.'' 
 People typically have one of two reactions when they witness this behavior -- either, ''This is a man whose stability is in doubt,'' or ''This guy is no corporate politician -- he really believes.''
 Trailing Mr. Ballmer this month, at a pair of speeches and small meetings with industry groups and customers, suggests that his performances have become more subtle. Speaking to several hundred people at the annual convention of the National Retail Federation in New York (one of about 120 such speeches he gives a year) he orates without notes or a teleprompter and paces the stage, rarely standing still for more than a couple of seconds. He tells the retailers of the two years he spent as an assistant product manager at Procter & Gamble before attending Stanford business school. (Then, in 1980, his old Harvard classmate Mr. Gates persuaded him to join Microsoft.)
 Mr. Ballmer gives the retailers a glimpse of how consumers will increasingly use technology to search, compare prices and shop. He tells them, ''Our company is committed to retail, and invested in your success.'' During a question-and-answer period, he says the ''heart and soul'' of connecting to the Internet, either by cellphone or PC, is ''likely to be a Microsoft operating system running a Microsoft browser.'' The unstated, but clear, message is this: stick with Microsoft, the safe choice.
 On the floor of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, Michael Mauerer was pinning his start-up company's success to Microsoft technology. His company, Retail Teamwork, is building software to automate the purchasing, sales and store operations of small to midsize retailers. His product is being built on the Microsoft's business applications software, a market that Microsoft entered in the last few years. ''Microsoft is a very safe bet,'' Mr. Mauerer said. ''They've never failed. They ultimately get it right.''
 Before and after the morning speech to retailers, Mr. Ballmer holds a dozen small meetings with senior managers from retailers including Wal-Mart, Circuit City, Safeway and Crate & Barrel. The next morning, after a five-mile run in Central Park, Mr. Ballmer has an 8 a.m. meeting with about two dozen corporate customers, mostly from Wall Street and commercial banks. In front of this smaller group of sophisticated information technology managers, Mr. Ballmer gives a very different talk and fields more detailed questions. The topics run from the intricacies of licensing data-center software to Microsoft's stance toward free software like Linux. 
 At one point, he says, ''All software will become software with a service.'' Mr. Ballmer emphasizes the word ''with.'' The clear message is that Microsoft is embracing the move toward software written by using open Web standards and delivered over the Internet, but that these software services will be added to Microsoft products instead of replacing them. We will move to the new world, he suggests, but will not cannibalize our flagship products.
 Mr. Ballmer tracks his calendar with a detailed Excel spreadsheet. ''I have a religious budget on my time,'' he says. Part of the religion is spending time with customers, about a third of his schedule. He jokes with his wife, Connie, and some colleagues that meetings with customers are his ''Sally Field moments,'' a reference to a 1991 movie, ''Soapdish.'' (In it, Ms. Field played a TV soap opera star whose most enjoyable time is spent mixing with ordinary fans at shopping malls.) 
 ''I get energy from seeing our customers,'' Mr. Ballmer explains. ''It reminds me of the things we're doing well and it also reminds me of the things where we need to improve.''
 Like many math geeks, Mr. Ballmer has a strong affinity for numbers. Colleagues describe him as extremely analytic when it comes to dissecting business plans and financial projections.
 ''He has a near-photographic memory for facts, and he can scan a spreadsheet and zoom in on the one aberrant figure that suggests a problem,'' observes Craig Mundie, the chief research and strategy officer. 
 Robert J. Bach, another senior Microsoft executive, says: ''I like to think I'm analytical, but I'm not in the same ZIP code as Steve.''
 But Mr. Ballmer says he does much of his thinking by talking to people. He likes to ''wallow'' in an issue, as he puts it, consulting customers, industry partners and Microsoft managers, often face to face. Numbers are important, he says, ''but for me it's different to see, touch and feel than it is to just sit there and look at kind of dry statistics.'' 
 He uses e-mail, but not like Mr. Gates, whose decision-making is far more solitary. Mr. Gates reads deeply, writes lengthy strategy documents and then sends them to senior staff members. ''Steve is very different,'' says one Microsoft executive, who requested anonymity. ''His north star is very tuned to the last customer or industry partner he talked to.'' 
 Computing is essentially math on steroids, and writing code is a deeply mathematical skill. And in his student days, Mr. Ballmer was an outstanding math student. He seemed to have all the makings of a computer whiz. But he says he gravitated to the business side of the technology industry because he wanted a more social career than that of a software engineer, with its long stretches of solitary toil. He decided that he lacked the temperament to really excel as a programmer.
 Growing up in suburban Detroit, the son of a midlevel manager at the Ford Motor Company, Mr. Ballmer earned a scholarship in his freshman year of high school to Detroit Country Day School, an academically demanding private school. He transferred from a public school and arrived at the private school a year behind in his math work. But he soon caught up and surpassed other students, helped by his math teacher, Edward Kuss, whom Mr. Ballmer called ''a major force in my life'' for igniting his interest in math.
 Mr. Ballmer took college graduate courses in math at nights with Mr. Kuss, participated in a summer National Science Foundation math program for advanced students and scored a perfect 800 on the math SAT exam. Mr. Kuss, now an actuary for an insurance company in Ohio, said Mr. Ballmer was fun to teach because ''he just soaked it up.'' 
 Yet Mr. Kuss recalled that what impressed him most was when Mr. Ballmer said his proudest achievement was shaving 20 seconds off his time running the quarter-mile. Even then, his time wasn't good, and his main event in track was the shot put. 
 To his former teacher, Mr. Ballmer's remark years ago speaks of persistence and character. ''The things that he was good at and came easily to him, like math and science, he enjoyed,'' Mr. Kuss observed. ''But the things he had to struggle with were the things that gave him the most satisfaction.''
 Mr. Ballmer went to Harvard, assuming that he would pursue a career in the sciences or math. He recalled taking a couple of physics and math courses during his freshman year. ''I was doing a lot of problem sets by myself, time in my room,'' he said. ''By the end of my freshman year, I decided it wasn't me. I knew I needed more interaction with people for me to be happy.''
 So he tilted his academic work away from science and toward business. He still kept a strong interest in math, majoring in applied mathematics as well as economics. He scored high in the prestigious William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition, an exam sponsored by the Mathematical Association of America; he did better than Mr. Gates -- no math slouch himself. 
 But Mr. Ballmer also took on extracurricular pursuits. He was a manager for the football team and worked on the business side of The Harvard Crimson newspaper and The Advocate, the college literary journal.
 AFTER he graduated, Mr. Ballmer went to work for Procter & Gamble, as an assistant brand manager for products like Duncan Hines brownie mix. The marketing trainees worked in small offices at the Cincinnati headquarters with their desks shoved together. Another young brand manager in the same office was Jeffrey R. Immelt, who is now chief executive of General Electric. Mr. Ballmer's ''intelligence and passion,'' Mr. Immelt recalled, were apparent back then. ''He was loud, spirited and fun, pretty much the same guy he is now,'' Mr. Immelt said.
 The two men have remained friends over the years, occasionally playing golf together and talking about business. One subject the two have discussed repeatedly is the necessity for big companies to constantly keep evolving and trying new things, some of which will succeed and some of which will fail. G.E., founded in the 19th century, has been evolving and trying new things for decades, Mr. Immelt said, while Microsoft has started to do so as well. ''My sense is that Steve really understands that and is committed to it,'' Mr. Immelt said. ''That takes courage.''
 Today, Mr. Ballmer is a member of the upper-tier of the world's superrich. His current stake in Microsoft is worth $12.7 billion.
 He rides a corporate jet for the roughly 200,000 air miles he logs annually on business, and he is shadowed by a pair of bodyguards. But his personal lifestyle is more comfortably affluent than ostentatious. His wife and his three sons live in the same two-story brick house in suburban Seattle that he bought before he was married. He has coached Little League, though no longer, friends say. He makes sure he is back home as many evenings and weekends as possible, for camping trips, Seattle SuperSonics games and other family outings.
 Pushing Microsoft outside its traditional comfort zone, Mr. Ballmer acknowledges, has not always been his first instinct. Microsoft was slow to invest in the market for software linking PCs in office networks in the 1980s and early '90s, he said, because the business looked very different from the market for desktop PC software. That hesitation allowed Novell to get a big early lead in PC networking software. 
 In 1998, when he became president of Microsoft, after managing product divisions and sales worldwide, Mr. Ballmer thought that the company was in too many businesses. He questioned, for example, whether Microsoft should be in the hardware business, making computer keyboards and mice. He was talked out of jettisoning hardware, and the expertise that Microsoft gleaned from that business made it easier later for the company to develop other promising hardware products, like Xbox and Zune.
 In 1999, Microsoft sold Sidewalk, an online city guide service. It seemed a wayward foray outside Microsoft's software business at the time. ''But Sidewalk was really aimed at what we now call local search,'' Mr. Ballmer says. ''Sidewalk is one we should not have gotten out of.''
 Today, he says, he tries to prod Microsoft to widen its vision. ''Focus is an essential thing, but you sort of want to focus short-term and be expansive long-term,'' he explains. ''If you really want to be a technology company that's relevant and important and driving value for the long run, you've got to have big eyes.''
 When Mr. Ballmer entered the computer business, and for years afterward, I.B.M. was the dominant company -- ''it was everything, the grand pooh-bah,'' he says. And, certainly, I.B.M.'s decision to use Microsoft's Disk Operating System, when the computer giant introduced its first PC in 1981, set the upstart software maker on its way. Mr. Ballmer says he admires and respects I.B.M., especially the way it transformed itself into a technology services company when the profits from I.B.M.'s mainframe business plummeted in the 1990s in the face of competition from lower-cost computers. I.B.M. changed its business model, and saved itself. 
 Yet Mr. Ballmer sees another important lesson in I.B.M.'s evolution. Over the years, I.B.M. pared back in businesses it once led. It got out of data center networking, and Cisco Systems became the leader. In computer chips, I.B.M. ceded the PC microprocessor market to Intel. Once I.B.M. was a leader in the software that companies use to run their factories, procurement and finances, but it pulled back from that market and SAP took over.
 ''I think if I.B.M. had been more willing to be expansive in its product portfolio and its innovation, and more long-term in its approach, it would be a very different company today,'' Mr. Ballmer says. ''That's my opinion, but it's a fundamental learning for me.''
 SO where, exactly, has Microsoft been expansive? Mr. Ballmer and others at the company point to Microsoft's video gaming business, led by its Xbox machines. Believing that software was playing an increasing role in consumer electronics, and that Internet-connected video machines looked to be a vital on-ramp for delivering technology to homes, the company decided to take a leap into video gaming at a meeting on Valentine's Day 2000, shortly after Mr. Ballmer became chief executive. 
 The meeting, in the Microsoft boardroom on the corporate campus in Redmond, Wash., was scheduled for an hour, but it lasted more than three hours. A handful of executives attended, including Mr. Gates, Mr. Ballmer and Mr. Bach, who now leads the Xbox and Zune units. 
 ''The real discussion came down to some very hard choices about Microsoft deciding to do something that was really not our normal model,'' Mr. Bach recalls. A video game console is tailored for playing games, unlike a personal computer, which is a general-purpose system. The Xbox would run its own software. ''It's not Windows,'' Mr. Bach says, ''and we don't pretend it's Windows'' -- a notion that was heretical inside Microsoft when Xbox was first concocted.
 Mr. Ballmer, according to Mr. Bach, told the participants at the meeting that they would not leave the room until a decision was made. When agreement was reached, Mr. Ballmer told Mr. Bach and J Allard, the leader of the Xbox development team: ''I won't be second-guessing you every third month. I trust this team; go get it done,'' as Mr. Bach recalled.
 The Xbox shipped in November 2001 and struggled at first, as gamers flinched at its $299 price. Within months, Microsoft cut the price by $100, and sales picked up; it eventually sold more than 24 million consoles. The next-generation Xbox 360, equipped for online gaming, arrived in the fall of 2005, beating Sony's PlayStation 3 to market by a year. More than 10.5 million Xbox 360 consoles have been sold, and half of the buyers subscribe to Xbox Live, an online gaming service.
 Still, despite investing billions, Microsoft has yet to show any profit from its video game venture. ''Look, the jury is still out,'' Mr. Ballmer acknowledges. ''But I feel very confident that we've built a good market position with Xbox. I feel very confident that we're on track to make money.'' The company has said the Xbox business, including hardware and software, should move into the black this year, but when, and if, the business will pay back its multibillion-dollar investment is unclear.
 And Zune, introduced late last year, is just beginning a long and costly uphill fight against Apple's iPod business in the digital music market. ''No other company, for better or worse, would be willing to get into that business at this time,'' Mr. Ballmer says. 
 The new product lines are Mr. Ballmer's answer to the most nettlesome questions about Microsoft's future: Where will it find new growth as the Windows and Office businesses continue to mature? Can Microsoft navigate its way to a future that is as bright as its past?
 The challenge comes amid a leadership transition at Microsoft, as Mr. Gates prepares to stop working daily at Microsoft by mid-2008, though he will remain the board chairman and the largest shareholder. Mr. Ballmer and Mr. Gates have shared one of the most enduring and lucrative partnerships in American business over the years. Put simply, Mr. Gates has served as the main architect and master strategist at Microsoft, while Mr. Ballmer has served more as the tactical field marshal.
 From the outset, Mr. Gates recalls in his e-mail message, ''it was clear to me that Steve's skills would be absolutely essential to our success.'' Though their talents and personalities are different, Mr. Gates said, ''we have a common view at the highest level of what the company needs to do to succeed: hire great people, make big bets and take the long view and be patient where we think there are the greatest opportunities.'' 
 Mr. Ballmer has been the company's chief executive since 2000. But on the day Mr. Gates announced his plans to spend more time on philanthropy, Mr. Ballmer recalled, he felt as if he was entering a ''new era'' personally and that he had a ''new job.'' 
 If Mr. Ballmer has entered a new era personally, some things still haven't changed. Not long ago, after finishing off a conversation with an aide, he backed up quickly and banged into a reporter, sending him reeling. With a helping hand and grin, Mr. Ballmer joked: ''So much for the kinder, gentler Ballmer. He's still knocking people down.''
 To the degree that a kinder, gentler Mr. Ballmer -- and Microsoft -- truly exist today, it is largely a legacy of the antitrust rulings against the company in the United States and Europe. A series of federal court rulings in the United States several years ago found Microsoft to have repeatedly bullied rivals and industry partners to illegally thwart competition. Until the court setbacks, Mr. Ballmer, like Mr. Gates, dismissed any suggestion that Microsoft had done anything wrong. Their view was that the suits against their company were the handiwork of disgruntled competitors lobbying antitrust regulators. 
 But once Microsoft lost, it became Mr. Ballmer's job to settle its legal troubles and repair the damage to the company's reputation. He appointed a new general counsel, Bradford L. Smith, and directed him to talk to and cooperate with people previously regarded as Microsoft enemies: government officials and competitors. 
 Mr. Smith says his job has been made easier by Mr. Ballmer's willingness to meet people on their own turf. For example, Mr. Ballmer opened settlement talks over a round of golf in California with Scott G. McNealy, Sun Microsystems' chairman, and addressed the French Senate in fluent French. (Mr. Ballmer spent two years in elementary school in Brussels.) An antitrust dispute remains with Europe. But Microsoft has settled state and federal lawsuits in the United States while paying more than $4 billion in private settlements related to the federal case.
 Forging better relations with industry rivals is a business strategy as well as a legal tactic for Microsoft because the complexity and broad dissemination of information technology means that Microsoft simply can't opt to go it alone anymore. 
 Cooperate-and-compete relationships are common among companies selling technology for data centers, the engine rooms where companies run customer databases, the back end of e-mail systems, and the like. There are many data center competitors, unlike the PC software market where Windows and Office programs hold more than a 90 percent share. Still, Microsoft has grown rapidly in the corporate software market, with revenue reaching more than $11 billion last year, though that business is far less profitable than Windows or Office. 
 MICROSOFT and EMC, a large maker of data storage systems, have built a strong partnership in the last couple of years; the two companies conduct joint marketing programs generating hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. ''It's a great relationship,'' said Joseph M. Tucci, the chief executive of EMC.
 Well, not always. In 2003, EMC bought VMware, a fast-growing Silicon Valley venture that makes software allowing computers to run multiple operating systems. Microsoft is working on this technology, known as a virtual machine, and VMware's software has the potential to undermine the importance of operating systems, Microsoft's mainstay.
 Just before EMC announced the purchase, Mr. Tucci called Mr. Ballmer to let him know, as a courtesy. Fine, Mr. Ballmer replied, but did Mr. Tucci know that a senior member of VMware's technical staff had just agreed to join Microsoft? Mr. Ballmer apparently could not resist the competitive jab, but the move backfired. Alerted, EMC and VMware executives persuaded the senior scientist, who had already looked at schools for his children in Seattle, to stay.
 Mr. Tucci laughed about the episode. ''We're mostly partners,'' he said, ''but Steve is going to try to beat the heck out of us in that market, and we're going to try to beat the heck out of Microsoft.'' Mr. Tucci has known Mr. Ballmer for years and says the Microsoft leader has become more broad-minded. ''Steve Ballmer is an intense competitor, and he still has to win,'' Mr. Tucci observed. ''But he has come around to the view that this is a big environment, and others have to win, too.''
 In the end, Mr. Ballmer must come up a winner in Internet services like search and untether Microsoft's software from the desktop by transforming it into a service that is distributed and accessed over the Internet -- both trends in which Google is the early leader.
 Inside Microsoft, there are differing views on the nature and immediacy of those threats. Microsoft, some executives point out, has trailed in previous technology waves, only to catch up and surpass rivals. Apple was the path-breaking innovator in point-and-click graphical computing with the Macintosh operating system, but Microsoft's Windows eventually became the big winner in the marketplace. In the 1990s, Netscape was the early leader in Internet browser software, only to have Microsoft catch up and smother that competitive threat.
 ''Is there some new agent, more disruptive than we have faced in the past?'' asks Mr. Mundie, the company's chief research and strategy officer. ''No, not really.''
 An internal memo written 15 months ago by Ray Ozzie, who has taken over for Mr. Gates as Microsoft's chief software architect, had a different tone. It was titled ''The Internet Services Disruption,'' and it was a call to action. ''It's clear that if we fail to do so, our business as we know it is at risk. We must respond quickly and decisively.''
 In an interview, Mr. Ozzie framed the challenge further. ''This is a big change; there's no question about it,'' he said. ''But it's been coming since the beginning of the Web.''
 The current round of Internet-driven change is different from the 1990s wave. Netscape never got to become the big rich company that Google is. Microsoft bundled its Internet Explorer browser into Windows and gave it away. But it has no similar way to crush Google search, which is free to consumers and supported by keyword advertising. 
 Still, analysts say it is also not clear what Google's business model will be as it moves increasingly beyond its lucrative stronghold of Internet search. It has many software and service offerings, some entirely online and some requiring small software downloads, including e-mail, satellite mapping, instant messaging, online word processing, spreadsheets and desktop search.
 Mr. Ballmer, of course, is watching closely for hints of Google's future plans. ''It's not like they are getting much ad revenue out of any of it,'' he says. ''Nothing out of Gtalk; nothing out of documents and spreadsheets. Are they going to try to trash our business, just give it away to help their business? Maybe. We'll see.''
 Mr. Ballmer and other Microsoft executives often scorn online alternatives to its desktop software as second-class options with no market. Internet-based software, they say, lacks the features and functions of Microsoft's ''rich client'' programs. Also, what happens when computer users are not connected to the Internet, say, on an airplane?
 That's wishful thinking on Microsoft's part, according to the Internet insurgents from Google and elsewhere. They say Microsoft's critiques attack older, browser-only programs instead of newer software services that place some applications on PCs while also linking the machines over the Web to supercomputing data centers. New features and services, they say, can flow to users every time they tap in, instead of waiting three years for the next version of Office. The classic work-on-a-plane problem? Researchers, they add, are working on caching software and other innovations to solve those kinds of issues. 
 Eric E. Schmidt, Google's chief executive, discussed the implications of this ''emergent new software applications architecture'' in a meeting with computer scientists in Washington last fall. 
 ''So the obvious question becomes to what degree can this replace the traditional Windows-dominant, PC-dominant, monopoly structure that we've all been used to,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''It's pretty clear to me that there are enough people working on this in research universities and in companies, building applications that empower this, to make it happen.''
 Microsoft recognizes the threat. The company has top technical talent working on Internet services, and it has brought out offerings like Office Live, a package of services to help small businesses set up Web sites. But some industry analysts say Microsoft is being too timid, fearful of cutting into its traditional PC software business. ''Microsoft is now focused and engaged, but we haven't seen much yet,'' said Richard G. Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman Sachs. ''Where's Office delivered as a service? Where's the online versions of Excel, Word and Powerpoint?''
 Microsoft, Mr. Sherlund said, has to recognize that ''there will probably be some cannibalization of Microsoft's existing business, but that's the price of customer acquisition going forward in Internet services.''
 ''And it could turn out to be a good business for Microsoft,'' he added, ''if they can generate online traffic and make money with better search and advertising.''
 Mr. Ballmer replies that there are different paths to putting more of Microsoft's offerings online as Internet services that rely on subscriptions or advertising to generate revenue. ''I guarantee you that all of those options have been considered, and some are being pursued,'' he says, declining to elaborate.
 TO succeed, Microsoft must convince new recruits that it will be a leader as the next wave of computing unfolds, and not just a defender of the status quo. Microsoft has suffered a few high-level defections of senior technical people recently, but has managed to lure some top talent as well.
 In 2005, Gary Flake left his post as the head of research at Yahoo to join Microsoft, where he set up Live Labs, its Internet research unit. Until Microsoft wooed him in earnest, Mr. Flake, 39, said he had not considered working for the company. He was a product of Silicon Valley's technology culture, and he said he had been recruited by Google and saw Microsoft as the old-line enemy.
 But Mr. Flake decided to join Microsoft after, he says, he came away ''stunned at how open the company was to change, how self-critical the culture was.''
 ''Microsoft, more than the others, is redefining itself,'' he added. ''And I do think Microsoft is in a position to raise the bar for what is possible in Internet services.''
 Embracing the Internet may be part of Mr. Ballmer's agenda, but he is still left with the chore of defending and milking Microsoft's huge cash cows, Windows and Office. When he talks about the Web, he accents the need for accelerated innovation. 
 In the same breath that he emphasizes innovation, Mr. Ballmer describes his new strategy in the vernacular that Microsoft has been using for years: ''embrace and extend'' -- in other words, new products and services should simply be extensions of the old. Even if rivals and industry experts doubt that the old Microsoft game plan will work this time, Mr. Ballmer is certain that it will. 
 ''We will do well,'' he told a group of investors and analysts at the company's headquarters last year. ''Whether it's me or the guy who replaces me because we don't do well. We'll keep coming, and we will do well.''

HEADLINE: Looking for the Angry Populists in Suburbia

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
IN his confrontational response to President Bush's State of the Union address on Tuesday, Senator Jim Webb of Virginia said that he was going to focus on only two topics. One, as everyone knew it would be, was Iraq.
 But before he turned to the war, the new senator spoke about something else: an economy that he said made it seem ''as if we are living in two different countries.'' In one, stock prices, corporate profits and executive pay are rising. In the other, the middle class is barely scraping by. 
Mr. Webb said the situation was reminiscent of the early 20th century, when robber barons were raking in wealth and ''dispossessed workers at the bottom were threatening revolt.''
 It was the sort of speech that one might have expected during a deep economic slump. Yet it came instead as most workers have started receiving significant pay increases for the first time in years and as polls show that most Americans think the economy has grown stronger.
 This contrast was arguably the most significant part of the speech. As they plan their strategy on Capitol Hill and begin the 2008 presidential campaign, the leaders of the Democratic Party are betting that the temporary swings of the economic cycle no longer have the political power they once did. 
 Instead, they say, the economic shocks of recent years -- technological change, globalization, the decline of labor unions and business icons like Ford Motor Company -- have left many swing voters feeling anxious and insecure about the future. 
 After years of fighting losing battles against tax cuts, Democrats argue that this economic anxiety has altered the political landscape, making swing voters open to a new role for government -- a form of what Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois has called ''suburban populism.'' 
 With issues like energy policy, immigration and health care having gone largely unaddressed in recent years, Democrats see a way to define themselves as the party that can help Americans survive the 21st-century economy. 
 An unanswered question, though, is whether suburban populism can still have appeal during good economic times.
 ''The little ups and downs of the economy are not what's bothering the average American, as much as it is the feeling that there are large forces that buffet them around,'' said Senator Charles Schumer of New York, whose book laying out an agenda for the party was published last week. ''In the past, the attitude was, 'Get government out of the way.' And now it's, 'Gee, I may need it.' ''
 Amy Klobuchar, a freshman senator from Minnesota, pointed out that her state had one of the strongest economies in the country, yet she still based her winning campaign largely on people's economic worries. ''They feel insecure,'' Ms. Klobuchar said last week. ''And the point of this is, they're right.''
 This strategy certainly has risks. Tax cuts -- with a heavy dose of optimism thrown in -- have been a much better political bet than populism for decades now, and Republicans are sticking to this script. During his address last week, Mr. Bush described the economy as being ''on the move,'' and he is scheduled to visit Peoria, Ill., this week to call attention to recent wage gains. Republicans are pushing for an extension of the tax cuts passed during Mr. Bush's first term that they say are a major cause of the current boom. 
 The economy emerged from a recession in late 2001, after the first tax cut went into effect, but wages for most workers still did not keep up with inflation for much of the next few years. Only in recent months has that changed.
 In 2006, the average hourly pay of rank-and-file workers, who make up about four-fifths of the work force, rose 4.2 percent, while the consumer price index increased only 2.6 percent. The net result -- an inflation-adjusted increase of 1.6 percent -- was a bigger annual raise than any that workers received from the late 1970s to the mid-90s.
 The direction of wages has historically been one of the best predictors, if not the best, of the public mood, and it, too, has been brightening. In a Gallup Poll conducted in mid-January, the share of respondents calling the economy excellent or good -- 52 percent -- reached its highest level since the Clinton administration. 
 But even with the recent increases, the real hourly pay of rank-and-file workers has risen only 3 percent since Mr. Bush took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Over the same span, productivity -- that is, the value of what the economy produces per hour -- has risen 18 percent. 
 Except for a few years in the late 1990s, in fact, pay increases have been modest for most of the last three decades, which appears to be contributing to the anxiety. In exit polls on Election Day, fewer than one in three people said they expected life for the next generation of Americans to be better than life today.
 But even if suburban populism has some appeal, Democrats have been less clear about how to translate it into policy. During their first weeks in control of the House, they have passed bills to raise the minimum wage, to cut the interest rate on federally subsidized loans to college students and allow government to negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over the cost of drugs sold through Medicare.
 But none of the bills has yet passed the Senate, and even if they do, they are unlikely to have a big effect on most middle-class families -- the target audience of the new suburban populism. 
 Some Democrats, in the party's center and on the left, are starting to push for broader ideas. In his new book, Mr. Schumer calls for biometric employment cards to reduce illegal immigration and a crackdown on tax evasion by the wealthy, among other measures. Tom Vilsack, the former Iowa governor who is running for president, is arguing for a push on new energy technology partly to ''elevate our economy above global competition.''
 It is still not clear how much can be done by a party that, for at least another year, will lack a clear leader. In his speech last week, Senator Webb cited two populist role models, Andrew Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt, both of whom were presidents, not Congressional leaders. 
 But the coming year will give the party's leaders a chance to hone its message -- and to see how long the current economic boom will last.

HEADLINE: In Law School, Obama Found Political Voice 

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Jan. 23 

 BODY:
The peers who elected Barack Obama as the first black president of the Harvard Law Review say he was a natural leader, an impressive student, a nice guy. But in the 1990 Revue -- the graduating editors' gleeful parody of their elite publication -- they said quite a bit more.
 ''I was born in Oslo, Norway, the son of a Volvo factory worker and part-time ice fisherman,'' a mock self-tribute begins. ''My mother was a backup singer for Abba. They were good folks.'' In Chicago, ''I discovered I was black, and I have remained so ever since.''
 After his election, the Faux-bama says, he united warring students into ''a happy, cohesive folk,'' while ''empowering all the folks out there in America who didn't know about me by giving a series of articulate and startlingly mature interviews to all the folks in the media.'' 
 In his two memoirs and the biographical video on his Web site, Senator Obama's legal education is barely a blip, one of the least known chapters of his life. But for the Illinois Democrat who is all but certainly running for the presidency, Harvard was the place where he first became a political sensation.
 He arrived there as an unknown, Afro-wearing community organizer who had spent years searching for his identity; by the time he left, he had his first national news media exposure, a book contract and a shot of confidence from running the most powerful legal journal in the country.
 As the ribbing in the Revue suggests, Mr. Obama was realizing the power of his own biography. He proved deft at navigating an institution scorched with ideological battles, many of which revolved around race. He developed a leadership style based more on furthering consensus than on imposing his own ideas. Surrounded by students who enjoyed the sound of their own voices, Mr. Obama cast himself as an eager listener, sometimes giving warring classmates the impression that he agreed with all of them at once. 
 Friends say he did not want anyone to assume they knew his mind -- and because of that, even those close to him did not always know exactly where he stood. It is a tendency that could prove perilous on the campaign trail, as voters, rivals and the news media try to fix the positions of a senator with only two years in office.
 ''He then and now is very hard to pin down,'' said Kenneth Mack, a classmate and now a professor at the law school, referring to the senator's on-the-one-hand, on-the-other-hand style. 
 Charles J. Ogletree Jr., another Harvard law professor and a mentor of Mr. Obama, said, ''He can enter your space and organize your thoughts without necessarily revealing his own concerns and conflicts.'' 
 Many of his former professors and classmates say they are cheering on Mr. Obama, 45, in his candidacy. But the skills he displayed in law school may not serve him as well in American presidential politics, which sometimes rewards other qualities -- like delivering sound bites instead of deliberateness or fidelity to a base of supporters instead of compromise.
 The law review is ''fairly disconnected from the breadth and the rough and tumble of real politics,'' said Bruce Spiva, a former review editor who now practices civil rights law in Washington. ''It's an election among a closed group. It's more like electing a pope.''
 Mr. Obama declined to comment about his time at Harvard. He arrived at the law school in 1988 with a well-inked passport -- he had grown up in Hawaii and Indonesia, son of a black Kenyan father and a white American mother -- and years of community organizing experience in Chicago, making him, at 27, an elder statesman among the students who had tested and term-papered their way straight there. 
 Mr. Obama spent much of his time alone, curtailing his dating life after his first summer, when he met his future wife, a Harvard Law graduate named Michelle Robinson who was working in Chicago. He often played pickup basketball, replacing his deliberative off-court style with sharp elbows and aggressive grabs for the ball.
 Along with 40-odd classmates, he won a precious spot on the law review at the end of his first year through grades and a writing competition. But the next year, when other students implored him to run for the presidency, he demurred; he wanted to return to community work in Chicago, he said, and the credential would be no help. Late in the process, he finally agreed, saying he might be uniquely able to heal the review's partisan divisions.
 The election was an all-day affair with the ego-crushing drama of a reality TV show. Inside Pound Hall, the editors picked apart the intellectual and social skills of the 19 contenders, eliminating them in batches. At the last moment, the conservative faction, its initial candidates defeated, threw its support to Mr. Obama. ''Whatever his politics, we felt he would give us a fair shake,'' said Bradford Berenson, a former associate White House counsel in the Bush administration.
 The two finalists were invited back into the room. But before the winner could be announced, Mr. Mack, a black student who had rejoined the editors after being eliminated, lunged toward Mr. Obama, so moved by the barrier that had just fallen that he embraced him tightly, tears streaming down both men's cheeks. 
 Newspapers and magazines swarmed around the first black student to win the most coveted spot at the most vaunted club at one of America's most prestigious institutions. In interviews, Mr. Obama was modest and careful. (In a rare slip, he told The Associated Press: ''I'm not interested in the suburbs. The suburbs bore me.'') He signed a contract to write a memoir. A prankster posted a cast list for a movie version of his life, starring Blair Underwood. When Mr. Underwood visited the school, he questioned Mr. Obama for material for ''L.A. Law.'' 
 ''People were always asking me, do young black attorneys really exist like that?'' Mr. Underwood said in a recent interview. ''I would refer to Barack.'' 
 Winning the job was simpler than doing it. The president had to reject articles by some of the school's famous professors and persuade a divided group of editors to stop arguing and start editing.
 ''I have worked in the Supreme Court and the White House and I never saw politics as bitter as at Harvard Law Review in the early '90s,'' Mr. Berenson said. ''The law school was populated by a bunch of would-be Daniel Websters harnessed to extreme political ideologies.'' They were so ardent that they would boo and hiss one another in class.
 Even trickier, Mr. Obama was the most prominent minority student on a campus shaken by racial politics. A group agitating for greater faculty diversity occupied the dean's office and sued the school for discrimination; Derrick Bell, a black law professor, resigned over the issue. 
 The law review struggled to decide whether affirmative action should factor into the selection of editors, and how much voice to give to critical race theorists, who argued that the legal system was inherently biased against minorities. That drew the ridicule of conservative students.
 And it left the new president with a difficult choice. If he failed to use his office to criticize Harvard, Mr. Obama would anger black and liberal students; by speaking out, he would risk dragging himself and the review into the center of shrill debates.
 People had a way of hearing what they wanted in Mr. Obama's words. Earlier, after a long, tortured discussion about whether it was better to be called ''black'' or ''African-American,'' Mr. Obama dismissed the question, saying semantics did notmatter as much as real-life issues, recalled Cassandra Butts, still a close friend. According to Mr. Ogletree, students on each side of the debate thought he was endorsing their side. ''Everyone was nodding, Oh, he agrees with me,'' he said.
 As the president of the review, Mr. Obama once again walked a delicate line. He served on the board of the Black Law Students Association, often speaking passionately about the tempest of the week, but in a way that white classmates say made them feel reassured rather than defensive. He distanced himself from bombast; he did a mischievous impersonation of the Rev. Jesse Jackson when he came to speak on campus, recalled Franklin Amanat, now a federal prosecutor in Brooklyn. Mr. Obama's boldest moment came at a rally for faculty diversity, where he compared Professor Bell to Rosa Parks. 
 But mainly, Mr. Obama stayed away from the extremes of campus debate, often choosing safe topics for his speeches. At the black law students' annual conference, he exhorted students to remember the obligations that came with their privileged education. His speeches, delivered in the oratorical manner of a Baptist minister, were more memorable for style than substance, Mr. Mack said. 
 ''It's the inspiration of the speech rather than the specific content,'' he said. 
 Just as he does now that he is a senator, Mr. Obama spoke then about his own biography -- initially, Mr. Ogletree said, to correct anyone who assumed he had acquired his position with ease. His message, Mr. Ogletree said, was, ''Don't look at my success and assume that I have had a silver spoon in my mouth and gold coins in my hand.'' 
 During the constant arguments about race and merit, everyone could point to Mr. Obama and find justification for their views. He had acknowledged benefiting from affirmative action in the past, so those who supported it saw him as the happy product of their beliefs.
 But those who opposed it saw his presidency as the triumph of meritocracy. He was a black man who had helped one of Harvard's most celebrated professors, Laurence H. Tribe, with an article on law and physics, and would graduate magna cum laude.
 Another of Mr. Obama's techniques relied on his seemingly limitless appetite for hearing the opinions of others, no matter how redundant or extreme. That could lead to endless debates -- a mouse infestation at the review office provoked a long exchange about rodent rights -- as well as some uncertainty about what Mr. Obama himself thought about the issue at hand. 
 In dozens of interviews, his friends said they could not remember his specific views from that era, beyond a general emphasis on diversity and social and economic justice. 
 Instead, they wonder how the style of leadership they observed on campus could translate to another kind of historic presidency. 
 ''The things that make law school politics fractious are different from the things that make American politics fractious,'' said Ron Klain, who preceded Mr. Obama at the law review and later served as Vice President Al Gore's chief of staff. Mr. Klain has watched the senator's rise. 
 ''The interesting caveat,'' he said, ''is that is a style of leadership more effective running a law review than running a country.''


CORRECTION-DATE: January 30, 2007

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article on Sunday reported on Barack Obama's years at Harvard Law School. It included a quotation from Ron Klain, former chief of staff to Vice President Al Gore, who said that Mr. Obama's inclusive leadership style as president of the Harvard Law Review would not be as effective in running a country.
 The Times later learned that Mr. Klain is an informal adviser to Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., Democrat of Delaware, who is expected to announce on Wednesday that he is running for president. Mr. Klain's affiliation with the Biden campaign should have been disclosed in the article.
 Also, a picture caption with the continuation of the article misstated the timing of the photograph, taken in the apartment of one of Mr. Obama's friends. It was taken during the 1990 midterm elections, not during the 1990 election for the Harvard Law Review.

 BODY:

ECONOMIC BAROMETERS -- Two critical economic events are scheduled to take place this week. First, on Wednesday, the Federal Open Market Committee is expected to meet and issue its decision on short-term interest rates; expectations are that the federal funds rate will remain at 5.25 percent. Investors have been hoping that rates would be lowered, but positive economic reports last week about new home sales and big factory orders have made that less likely. On Friday, the government is expected to report on unemployment for December, with forecasters predicting an increase of 140,000 jobs. 


VISTA FOR THE HOME PC -- Microsoft plans to introduce its Vista operating system to consumers on Tuesday after a two-year delay in getting the much-anticipated product to the market. Some computer stores will stay open past midnight Monday so that eager customers can get their copies right away.

PRELIMINARY G.D.P. NUMBERS -- This week will bring the first look at the fourth-quarter gross domestic product (Wednesday). Other economic reports include the Conference Board's look at consumer confidence (Tuesday); the Chicago purchasing managers' index for January and construction spending for December (Wednesday); and personal income and spending for December and the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing index for January (Thursday).

AUTO SALES -- On Thursday, automakers are scheduled to report sales for January. Given last week's crushing news that 2006 had been the worst year in the history of the Ford Motor Company -- and that Toyota keeps narrowing the gap between itself and General Motors as the world's largest automaker -- the report is likely to receive much scrutiny. It is expected to show increasing market share for foreign manufacturers.

EARNINGS APLENTY -- A heavy week for earnings reports will give the markets a gauge of business strength. Among companies reporting this week are Verizon, Schering-Plough and Tyson Foods (Monday); Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch Shell, Merck, 3M, Procter & Gamble, Colgate-Palmolive, Kellogg, UPS, US Airways and United States Steel (Tuesday); Altria, Boeing, Eastman Kodak, Eli Lilly, Google, Kraft Foods, Starbucks and Time Warner (Wednesday); Amazon.com, Archer Daniels Midland, Clorox, Comcast, Electronic Arts, International Paper, JetBlue and Raytheon (Thursday); and Gannett and Sara Lee (Friday).

HEADLINE: Silicon Valley Rebounds, Led by Green Technology

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
After five years of job losses, Silicon Valley is hiring again. The turnaround coincides with a huge increase of investment in the emerging category of clean environment technology. 
 ''We're looking at a tremendous market opportunity,'' said David Pearce, founder and chief executive of Mirasole, a manufacturer of solar cell technology in Santa Clara, Calif. ''Supply is the only constraint.''
Mr. Pearce founded the company in 2001, but it was not until the middle of 2006 that Mirasole embarked on an ambitious plan to grow from 25 people a year ago, to at least 300 employees by the end of 2007. Today, Mirasole has 95 employees, most of them engineers and scientists. 
 Mr. Pearce's company may serve as a harbinger in this region. For Mirasole, which in October closed a $35 million round of venture financing, the time is finally right for quantity sales of the solar cell product it has spent the last few years designing. 
 In Silicon Valley, investment in clean technology -- from alternative energy products, like solar panels and hybrid cars, to the use of nanotechnology to solve environmental problems -- went from $34 million in the first quarter of 2006 to $290 million in the third quarter, according to an annual report released Sunday by Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network, a research organization in San Jose, Calif. 
 ''It's the hottest area of investment right now,'' said Tom Werner, chief executive of SunPower, a solar technology company.
 Russell Hancock, chief executive of Joint Venture, said the emerging need for clean technology is a good fit with the skills and companies already in the area. ''A new cluster is emerging in Silicon Valley that provides leadership around global climate change,'' Mr. Hancock said. 
 Clean technology crosses many industries, with nearly a quarter of the venture capital in clean technology going to software companies, followed by 15 percent going to semiconductor companies. While it is unclear precisely how many jobs were added in the field, the increase is substantial.
 But Silicon Valley's job gains are not limited to clean technology. Overall nonfarm employment in Silicon Valley, a region sprawling across 1,500 square miles over four counties, grew by more than 33,000 from the second quarter of 2005 through the second quarter of 2006, an increase of nearly 3 percent. Overall venture capital investment in Silicon Valley was $5.2 billion in the first nine months of 2006, compared with $4.6 billion in the same period in 2005. 
 While the job growth is still far from what the area enjoyed during the boom years of the late 1990s, it is a major reversal. After the dot-com bubble burst six years ago, thousands of engineers and technology workers were unemployed, with suddenly little demand for their skills. In 2002 alone, Silicon Valley lost more than 10 percent of its jobs. During the downturn, it had a net loss of 220,000 jobs.
 Stephen Levy, an economist with the Center for the Continuing Study of the California Economy, said the growing demand for clean technologies might well make this emerging boom cycle a lasting trend. Developments on the legislative front may help stimulate that growth. In September, California lawmakers set a goal of cutting the state's greenhouse emissions 25 percent by 2020. 
 ''Every time there's a new technology, Silicon Valley does pretty well,'' he said. ''That's beginning to happen again.''
 The region first started to show a reversal in late 2005, Mr. Levy said, a trend he attributed to an increase in worldwide demand for technology products. ''Silicon Valley sells more to international markets than any other region, so we can grow as the international market grows, even if the U.S. market isn't growing,'' he said. 
 These days, signs of a recovery in Silicon Valley are widespread. Office vacancy rates are declining, while road traffic, an unofficial barometer of employment in California, is noticeably increasing. 
 Median household income in Santa Clara County, the largest county of Silicon Valley, was up in 2005 for the first time since the downturn. It reached $76,300 in 2005, the most recent year for which figures are available, compared with $72,000 in 2004, the lowest point since the downturn. 
 Mr. Hancock points out that Silicon Valley has been characterized by boom-and-bust cycles for decades. Industries based on military contracting, personal computing and electronic commerce have thrived and then were followed by a period of contraction. Now, almost everyone agrees that Silicon Valley is coming back again.
 ''These waves are nothing new,'' Mr. Hancock said. ''But the last one was full of hype and excess, and we had to go through a powerful period of readjustment. This time the investing feels more sober and well thought out.''
 Besides clean technology, the region is seeing an increase of jobs in the creative sector, a trend that Mr. Hancock attributes to the growing needs of new-media companies. Much of the job growth is in small companies. More Silicon Valley companies have offices overseas, the study says, and there has been a sharp rise in the joint patents with foreign companies.
 Despite the surge in jobs, Silicon Valley faces considerable challenges. According to the report, the percentage of first-time home buyers who can afford a median-priced home declined to 26 percent, from 31 percent in 2005. The high school graduation rate is down, while the crime rate is up. 
 ''We face all the same challenge we did before,'' Mr. Levy said. ''We can add jobs, but we still have a lot to do to make this a place where people want to live.''

HEADLINE: Harnessing the Web To Sell Online Security

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
THIRTY percent of Internet users still do not trust technology enough to buy something online. But will they use the Web to buy security software?
 The Internet service provider EarthLink hopes that they will. The company said it would announce new security services today, to be available to both EarthLink users and others, aimed at thwarting new hacking techniques that specialists regard as particularly insidious. The new services could also help EarthLink fortify its flagging bottom line and reduce customer service calls from users afflicted by computer viruses.
''The whole axis of the world is moving toward an Internet-based economy,'' said Craig Forman, an EarthLink executive vice president, who, among other things, oversees sales of security services. ''Security is a critical portion of the success of that economy.'' 
 The new feature, called Attack Shield, is a premium offering intended to complement the company's Protection Control Center security service, which EarthLink subscribers receive free. Attack Shield will cost EarthLink subscribers $24 annually, or $3 a month. Those who are not members, but who pay $36 annually or $4 monthly for the Protection Control Center service, will receive Attack Shield at no added cost.
 Attack Shield relies on technology from Sana Security, a software vendor based in San Mateo, Calif., that specializes in what is known as behavior-based intrusion detection methods. Such programs essentially watch a personal computer for suspicious-looking software -- for instance, applications hidden in remote areas of the computer that then replicate themselves, or programs that load themselves onto a PC unbidden.
 Antivirus software companies like McAfee, Symantec and others, using conventional Internet security methods, find a copy of such a malicious program, identify a signature string of computer code unique to it, then circulate to customers a software application to block programs with that signature.
 The signature-based approach, though, does little for those who are victimized by a new attack before security companies have had a chance to obtain the program's signature and circulate an antidote. And because many hackers now are sophisticated financial criminals, rather than the rascals of old, their programs are more likely to mutate so quickly that the signature they leave on one person's computer could look nothing like the signature left on someone else's machine.
 These new ''malware'' programs, as they are known in the computer security field, are the most popular distribution method for programs that have turned an estimated 11 percent of the world's computers into ''zombie'' machines used in fraud, spam distribution and online identity theft.
 By opening a new front in cyber crime, hackers have also opened a new market for security companies. This month, Symantec announced a behavior-based detection technology, called Sonar, to thwart malware intrusions, and analysts said other companies were working hard to introduce competing technology or refine what they already have.
 EarthLink has offered Attack Shield on a trial basis since early in the month, according to Mr. Forman, who declined to say how many customers the service had. 
 ''Most of the users are EarthLink customers, but we're very happy with its progress among those who aren't EarthLink customers,'' he said. ''This is part of our strategy to widen out the potential universe of folks who EarthLink can reach. And security is a huge part of why our existing members are loyal to EarthLink.''
 He said the security service was also an important way for EarthLink to increase revenue as it tries to persuade Attack Shield users to become full EarthLink subscribers. The company lost $3.2 million in the third quarter of 2006, the latest quarter for which EarthLink has reported financial results. Revenue increased 4.5 percent over the 2005 quarter, to $331.3 million.
 EarthLink, like AOL, has struggled to grow amid heavy competition from cable Internet providers and phone companies. It has had to glean revenue from its 5.3 million existing customers by selling them more services like Internet telephony and online video subscriptions. 
 Such efforts have paid dividends, Mr. Forman said, as well as the company's emphasis on selling security services. ''Security is very much a moneymaker for us,'' he said.
 According to Andrew Jacquith, an analyst with the Yankee Group, a technology consulting firm based in Boston, the Attack Shield effort is likely to appeal to a small percentage of the market at first, even though he said it was ''a step ahead'' of other security services in effectiveness and simplicity.
 ''A certain amount of education needs to happen before customers figure out that this is what they'll want to have,'' Mr. Jacquith said. ''So having companies like EarthLink behind it will help a lot.'' He added that other Internet providers would offer similar services to their customers in the coming months, accelerating the process.
 The consumer market for security software, which the research firm IDC said reached $1.6 billion last year, has increasingly moved online in recent years, as vendors like McAfee and CA align themselves with Internet service providers to gain market share.
 Selling software to consumers online is much more efficient than selling through retail stores. But analysts have criticized security vendors for distributing their software through Internet providers. As good as such deals are for gaining new customers, they yield far less revenue for each subscriber -- as little as $3 a customer, by some estimates -- compared with the $30 they can make by selling through a retailer.
 Sana has no such concerns, because it has traditionally sold to businesses, not consumers. Sana's revenue was under $20 million last year, according to Timothy Eades, its senior vice president for marketing, though last year's sales were five times in 2005.
 Symantec, one of the biggest security software vendors, also distributes its software through Internet providers, but Erin Hintz, the vice president for worldwide consumer marketing, said the company had been careful not to give its products away too cheaply.
 ''We've been pretty good about striking partnerships where it's beneficial for both parties, while some of our competitors haven't,'' Ms. Hintz said. Over all, though, consumers have ''absolutely shifted more and more online as their preferred buying channel,'' she said, as banks and other financial services companies joined Internet providers in selling security software to their customers.
 Try as they may, such efforts will do little to attract the nearly one-third of consumers who, according to Forrester Research, are still leery of buying anything online.
 ''That's why people will often purchase for the first time in a retail store,'' Ms. Hintz said. ''Then when they renew their subscription, they're more comfortable doing the transaction online.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Children And Adoption

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Mystery of the Chinese Baby Shortage,'' by Beth Nonte Russell (Op-Ed, Jan. 23):
When I visited Wanxian, China, in the fall of 2005, I talked to local Chinese and visited an orphanage. One couple I spoke with had been relocated from the banks of the Yangtze River with their village and were happy and thriving with the relocation. They approved of the one-child policy, and with a son in college were now financially able to adopt a little girl. 
 In other parts of China, I discovered that families were financially better off than they were when I visited seven years earlier, and they also supported the one-child policy and were adopting the little girls. 
 Local Chinese have been embarrassed by the adoption of children by other countries, and take pride in stemming that activity and keeping little girls in China, where they strongly feel they belong. 

Carole Hite Welch

To the Editor:
 In ''The Mystery of the Chinese Baby Shortage,'' Beth Nonte Russell asserts that the one-child policy is inhumane, and if revoked, all the suffering and abandonment would cease, resulting in the end of China's international adoption program.
 I am the coordinator of a China adoption program. Unfortunately, what Ms. Russell does not seem to consider is that China is a country with 1.3 billion people, and without population control, this booming economy would be overwhelmed by the need for jobs and food already difficult for some to procure within an even larger population. 
 While it is irrefutable that the one-child policy has resulted in thousands of abandoned children, many of them have found loving, supportive homes. Without the policy, these very same children would likely face starvation and lives of little potential. Making reproduction a social decision rather than an individual one has China doing what is best for its nation and people.

Andrea L. Albright
St. Paul, Jan. 24, 2007

To the Editor:
 Beth Nonte Russell places most of the blame for China's gender gap on the one-child policy, and the Chinese government itself has conceded that the policy has worsened the shortage of females. The suggestion to scrap the policy, however, does not seem to address the root of the problem: the cultural preference for male children. 
 I find it naive to assume that eliminating the one-child policy will significantly reduce the incidence of female infanticide short of major cultural changes, and even if it does, there will be that many more unwanted female infants born who will likely not receive the same degree of nurturing and attention as their male counterparts. 
 I offer no suggestions as to how to transform a society's cultural beliefs regarding the ''value'' of female children, but short of such a transformation, any revision to the one-child policy will be purely cosmetic.

HEADLINE: IRANIAN REVEALS PLAN TO EXPAND ROLE INSIDE IRAQ

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ; Abdul Razzaq al-Saiedi contributed reporting from Baghdad, and Mark Mazzetti from Washington.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
Iran's ambassador to Baghdad outlined an ambitious plan on Sunday to greatly expand its economic and military ties with Iraq -- including an Iranian national bank branch in the heart of the capital -- just as the Bush administration has been warning the Iranians to stop meddling in Iraqi affairs. 
 Iran's plan, as outlined by the ambassador, carries the potential to bring Iran into further conflict here with the United States, which has detained a number of Iranian operatives in recent weeks and says it has proof of Iranian complicity in attacks on American and Iraqi forces.
The ambassador, Hassan Kazemi Qumi, said Iran was prepared to offer Iraq government forces training, equipment and advisers for what he called ''the security fight.'' In the economic area, Mr. Qumi said, Iran was ready to assume major responsibility for Iraq reconstruction, an area of failure on the part of the United States since American-led forces overthrew Saddam Hussein nearly four years ago. 
 ''We have experience of reconstruction after war,'' Mr. Qumi said, referring to the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s. ''We are ready to transfer this experience in terms of reconstruction to the Iraqis.''
 Mr. Qumi also acknowledged, for the first time, that two Iranians seized and later released by American forces last month were security officials, as the United States had claimed. But he said that they were engaged in legitimate discussions with the Iraqi government and should not have been detained.
 Mr. Qumi's remarks, in a 90-minute interview over tea and large pistachio nuts at the Iranian Embassy here, amounted to the most authoritative and substantive response the Iranians have made yet to increasingly belligerent accusations by the Bush administration that Iran is acting against American interests in Iraq. 
 President Bush has said the American military is authorized to take whatever action necessary against Iranians in Iraq found to be engaged in actions deemed hostile.
 The Iranian ambassador abruptly agreed to a longstanding request for the interview -- made repeatedly after the first American seizure of Iranians here on Dec. 21 -- and seemed eager to rebut the accusations. 
 The political and diplomatic standoff that followed the Dec. 21 raid until the Iranians were released nine days later has contributed, along with a dispute over the Iranian nuclear program, to greatly increased tensions between the United States and Iran. This month, American forces detained five more Iranians in a raid on a diplomatic office in the northern city of Erbil.
 While providing few details, the United States has said that evidence gleaned in the Baghdad raid, made on an Iraqi Shiite leader's residential compound, proves the Iranians were involved in planning attacks. 
 How much direction, if any, Mr. Qumi was taking from his government was unclear in the interview, in which he showed disdain for the American accusations as well as a few flashes of restrained sarcasm.
 He ridiculed the evidence that the American military has said it collected, including maps of Baghdad delineating Sunni, Shiite and mixed neighborhoods -- the kind of maps, American officials have said, that would be useful for militias engaged in ethnic slaughter. Mr. Qumi said the maps were so common and easily obtainable that they proved nothing.
 He declined to say whether he believed the maps bore sectarian markings or address other pieces of evidence the Americans said they had found, like manifests of weapons and material relating to the technology of sophisticated roadside bombs. But that is not why the Iranians were in the compound, he said.
 ''They worked in the security sector in the Islamic Republic, that's clear,'' Mr. Qumi said, referring to Iran. But he said that the Iranians were in Iraq because ''the two countries agreed to solve the security problems.'' The Iranians ''went to meet with the Iraqi side,'' he said.
 In a surprise announcement, Mr. Qumi said Iran would soon open a national bank in Iraq, in effect creating a new Iranian financial institution right under the Americans' noses. A senior Iraqi banking official, Hussein al-Uzri, confirmed that Iran had received a license to open the bank, which he said would apparently be the first ''wholly owned subsidiary bank'' of a foreign country in Iraq.
 ''This will enhance trade between the two countries,'' Mr. Uzri said.
 Mr. Qumi said the bank was just the first of what he said would be several in Iraq -- an agricultural bank and three private banks also intend to open branches. Other elements of new economic cooperation, he said, include plans for Iranian shipments of kerosene and electricity to Iraq and a new agricultural cooperative involving both countries.
 He would not provide specifics on Iran's offer of military assistance to Iraq, but said it included increased border patrols and a proposed new ''joint security committee.'' 
 Any Iranian military assistance to Iraq would be fraught with potential difficulties. Aside from provoking American objections, such assistance could further alienate Sunni Arabs, many of whom already suspect that Iran, overwhelmingly Shiite, is encouraging Iraq's Shiite-led government in persecuting them. 
 A number of American and Iraqi officials said Sunday that it was difficult to respond to Mr. Qumi's statements until they had been communicated through official routes. A spokesman for the American Embassy in Baghdad, Lou Fintor, declined to address the statements.
 Sean McCormack, a State Department spokesman, said Sunday that the United States had a significant body of evidence tying Iran to sectarian attacks inside Iraq. ''There is a high degree of confidence in the information that we already have, and we are constantly accumulating more,'' Mr. McCormack said.
 He did not address any of the specifics of Mr. Qumi's comments about plans for stronger economic and security ties, but said that Iran currently plays ''a negative role in many respects'' in the country.
 Iraqi officials also said that they could not comment on specific programs until they had seen the details, but expressed a range of views on the wisdom of expanding ties with Iran. 
 ''We are welcoming all the initiatives to participate in the process of reconstruction,'' said Qasim Daoud, a former national security adviser who is now a secular Shiite member of Parliament. ''My belief is that our strategic alliance is with the Americans, but at the same time we are looking for the participation of any country that would like to participate,'' Mr. Daoud said.
 Barham Salih, a deputy prime minister who is Kurdish and whose duties include economic matters, took sharper issue with Mr. Qumi's criticism of the American presence.
 ''Iraqi national interest requires seeking good neighborly relations with Iran as with other neighbors, but that requires respect for Iraqi sovereignty,'' Mr. Salih said.
 Mr. Qumi spoke largely in Persian during the interview, but he occasionally broke into English when he wanted to be certain that a point had been conveyed forcefully.
 Although Mr. Qumi was not given specific questions before the interview, he was made aware of the general topics that would be covered and seemed prepared with detailed answers in many cases. He seemed keen to give his government's view of what occurred in the early morning of Dec. 21, when American forces raided the Baghdad compound of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, one of Iraq's most powerful Shiite leaders, who had traveled to Washington three weeks before to meet President Bush.
 Within the compound, the Iranians were seized in the house of Hadi al-Ameri, who holds two powerful positions: he is chairman of the Iraqi Parliament's security committee and leader of the Badr Organization, the armed wing of Mr. Hakim's party, which spent years in exile in Iran.
 Although the Americans have suggested that the Iranians were providing support for militias like the Badr Organization, Mr. Qumi said that his countrymen were dealing with Mr. Ameri in his government capacity.
 The Iranians would not even have stayed the night in the compound except, in a situation faced by many Baghdad residents, their business lasted beyond the early-evening curfew and they were forced to spend the night, Mr. Qumi said.
 Mr. Qumi also warned the United States against playing out tensions in what he called ''the nuclear file'' in Iraq. ''We don't need Iraq to pay the cost of our animosity with the Americans,'' Mr. Qumi said.
 As the interview was breaking up, Mr. Qumi made one last stab at the Americans. If Iran is allowed to undertake reconstruction activities in Iraq, he said, all international construction companies would be welcome. ''Urge the American companies to come here,'' he said.

HEADLINE: A Serbian Region Unravels With Its Textile Industry 

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS WOOD

DATELINE: LESKOVAC, Serbia 

 BODY:
The crumbling factory walls and idle smokestacks that dominate this town are replicated across Eastern Europe: symbols of once proud industrial centers that fell into decline almost as soon as the Berlin Wall came down. 
 But as vast parts of Eastern Europe laboriously rebuilt their economies in the 1990s, and joined in European life, Serbia did not follow suit. It pursued wars in parts of the former Yugoslavia -- Croatia, Bosnia and Kosovo -- which in turn led to Western sanctions and NATO airstrikes.
Even in the eight years since the last war ended, commerce has not revived in cities like Leskovac, in southeastern Serbia. The heavy cost is still being tallied, in the young who flee and the others who turn gray and dispirited. 
 Babicko, a nearby village, is simply dying. Of 700 residents, only 4 are children of school age. Houses, whether of stone or mud brick, are falling into disrepair. When the time comes, ''my daughter can try to sell it,'' said Ljuboslava Svetkovic, a pensioner living there, of her house. ''If not, it will all collapse.''
 Leskovac's proud industrial history, in which textiles played a leading role, dates back 150 years. In the 1860s, Leskovac was Serbia's second largest city, and by the start of the 20th century, its wool and cloth exports brought the city renown as a second Manchester, after the English city famed for its textiles. In 1990, Leskovac had a population of 69,000, with nearly 11,000 employed in its textile factories. 
 Today, the industry has collapsed and has just 880 workers. Pensioners and the unemployed outnumber those with jobs. 
 It may not be surprising that a mainstay export industry would suffer from wars and isolation. But it is the years of peace that have left local residents angry. 
 ''It's the Turks and Chinese,'' said Novica Ilic, the director of Sintetika, one of 17 textile companies in Leskovac. The city's factories, he said, could never hope to compete with the cheap labor and technical innovation from China and Turkey.
 But isolation, not globalization, is more likely the culprit, a result of the wars, in which more than 200,000 people died. For that, there is anger at the government. Local critics say the political elite in Belgrade, the capital, is mired in issues dating from the wars and is not focusing on reforms. They also point to the buoyant economy in Serbia's north, including Belgrade; the country as a whole is growing at a pace of about 6 percent a year.
 Nevertheless, even Mr. Ilic admits that Serbia's textile sector is being outpaced by neighboring countries that have found a place in the global market. 
 A new report by the European Stability Initiative, which does economic research from offices in Germany, Turkey and the Balkans, noted the success of Stip, a city similar to Leskovac in Macedonia, another part of the former Yugoslavia. Investments flowed in after the sales of state-owned textile factories to private owners in 2001 and 2002. Exports increased sixfold, the report says, and unemployment dropped from 12,000 to a point that ''directors complain about a shortage of labor.''
 While some large industries in Serbia have been privatized -- steel and tobacco plants were sold to American companies -- most state- or community-owned enterprises are stuck in limbo, economists say. If anything, their debts are growing. 
 In Leskovac, privatization has barely begun. Ten companies, including Sintetika, remain socially owned, a term that implies ownership by the workers. Much-needed investment in technology has failed to materialize. 
 ''They are not ready to tackle the social problems and face the workers,'' said Mr. Ilic, the company director. 
 Many blame Belgrade. ''There simply is no economic policy,'' complained Jovica Svetkovic, the head of Leskovac's economic planning department. For the last six years, he said, Serbia's political debate has been dominated by issues stemming from the breakup of Yugoslavia, including relations with neighboring Montenegro and the future of Kosovo, a Serbian province that remains under United Nations control.
 Other issues also bear a heavy economic cost. Perhaps most important, Serbia has failed to normalize its ties with the European Union, which is most likely to provide it with investment and markets. Its failure to locate and hand over Ratko Mladic, the former commander of the Bosnian Serb army, to face war crimes charges in The Hague, has delayed the signing of a preliminary agreement with the European Union. Such an agreement would be a milestone toward membership in the European Union and would improve trade relations, something that Macedonia has already done. 
 ''Basically, this country is stuck with the Mladic case and the Hague tribunal,'' said Goran Svilanovic, the foreign minister first of Yugoslavia, then of Serbia and Montenegro, and now a member of the Serbian Parliament.
 Western diplomats in the region hope that after parliamentary elections in January, Serbia's two main democratic parties will be able to patch together a governing alliance, bringing about conditions that could foster reform. 
 But in Leskovac and its outlying villages, this is one more hollow promise. 
 ''This is the Balkans,'' said a forlorn Ljubisa Svetanovic, 55, who lives in Babicko. ''God has said good night. Life stopped here a long time ago.''

HEADLINE: A Free-Market Economist, Up by His Bootstraps 

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
Milton Friedman, arguably the most influential economist of the 20th century, died in November at 94, and today the world is commemorating him. In celebration of what has officially been named Milton Friedman Day, universities, political institutes and online discussion groups around the country will conduct debates and pay tribute to his legacy. 
 What this at least partly seems to suggest is that liberals do not sanctify their own with quite the same verve as their conservative counterparts. One of Mr. Friedman's greatest rivals, the Harvard economist John Kenneth Galbraith, died about six months earlier, in April, and Americans have yet to bear witness to a similar pageantry. 
Mr. Galbraith makes a brief appearance in ''The Power of Choice: The Life and Ideas of Milton Friedman,'' a documentary on PBS tonight, as the only detractor to Mr. Friedman's free-market absolutism. The film is so unabashedly venerating -- it would credit Mr. Friedman with inventing the Hubble Telescope if it could -- that it ultimately does its subject a disservice, refusing the spirit of argument that was so obviously Mr. Friedman's lifeblood. 
 Mr. Friedman was an outspoken and lively man who relished his role in the real world as much as he did his stature inside the academy. He became a brand name for a certain kind of partisan politics, and as a public intellectual he seemed to have quite a good time, amused as he often seemed to be at the brilliance of his logic and the ready audience for it. In his PBS series, ''Free to Choose,'' over 25 years ago, he popularized his ideas with a child's sense of novelty. In it he has fun illustrating his theory of monetary policy by pressing the button that stops the printing of money at the United States Mint. 
 The child of Eastern European immigrants, he grew up in Rahway, N.J., above a dry-goods store. His mother briefly worked in a sweatshop. ''Intellectual ideas'' were not, as Mr. Friedman explains in the film, ''a live concept.'' But Mr. Friedman, an excellent student, found his way to Rutgers University as an undergraduate, where he started a business selling ties and went on to graduate school at the University of Chicago, the institution to which he would be inextricably linked for the rest of his life. It was there as well that he met his wife and lifelong collaborator, Rose Director, who says in the film of first meeting her husband, ''He was more intellectual than I was, but not too much.''
 Mr. Friedman's rise to public prominence as the great anti-Keynesian, the world's most impassioned champion of open competition and limited government intervention in economic affairs, was solidified during the Reagan years, but was given its push by his involvement in Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential bid. It was for Goldwater that he developed a program of economic policy objectives that included not just the deregulation of major industries, but the folding of the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the abolishment of national parks (matters overlooked in the film). Nowhere in ''The Power of Choice'' is the downside of the massive deregulation that Reagan eventually implemented given much attention. The savings-and-loan scandals, for instance, go undiscussed.
 The filmmakers implicitly and explicitly credit Mr. Friedman with everything from the rise of the Indian, Chinese and Estonian economies to the abolishment of the military draft. Though Mr. Friedman's free-choice doctrine contributed to ending the draft in the 1970s, the film takes virtually no note of the cultural and political climate in which he was making his opinions known. Nor does it address one result of the draft's elimination: a military not well represented by affluent men and women who have many choices, but dominated by comparatively disadvantaged ones with far fewer options. 
 Mr. Galbraith, in the film, denounces Mr. Friedman as a ''one-cause, one-cure man.'' ''The Power of Choice'' is just as reductive in its praise.

CORRECTION-DATE: February 9, 2007

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, a television review on Jan. 29 about ''The Power of Choice: The Life and Ideas of Milton Friedman,'' a documentary on PBS, misidentified the agency that prints United States currency. It is the Bureau of Engraving and Printing -- not the Mint, which makes coins. (In a series Mr. Friedman had on PBS many years ago, which, like the documentary, showed his enjoyment of being a public intellectual, he was once shown pressing a button to stop the printing.)

HEADLINE: The Sum Of All Ears

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
For those hoping for real action on global warming and energy policy, the State of the Union address was a downer. There had been hints and hopes that the speech would be a Nixon-goes-to-China moment, with President Bush turning conservationist. But it ended up being more of a Nixon-bombs-Cambodia moment. 
 Too bad: the rumors were tantalizing. Al Hubbard, the chairman of the National Economic Council, predicted ''headlines above the fold that will knock your socks off in terms of our commitment to energy independence.'' British officials told the newspaper The Observer that Mr. Bush would ''make a historic shift in his position on global warming.'' 
None of it happened. Mr. Bush acknowledged that climate change is a problem, but you missed it if you sneezed. He said something vague about fuel economy, but the White House fact sheet on energy makes it clear that there was even less there than met the ear.
 The only real substance was Mr. Bush's call for a huge increase in the supply of ''alternative fuels.'' Mainly that means using ethanol to replace gasoline. Unfortunately, that's a really bad idea.
 There is a place for ethanol in the world's energy future -- but that place is in the tropics. Brazil has managed to replace a lot of its gasoline consumption with ethanol. But Brazil's ethanol comes from sugar cane.
 In the United States, ethanol comes overwhelmingly from corn, a much less suitable raw material. In fact, corn is such a poor source of ethanol that researchers at the University of Minnesota estimate that converting the entire U.S. corn crop -- the sum of all our ears -- into ethanol would replace only 12 percent of our gasoline consumption.
 Still, doesn't every little bit help? Well, this little bit would come at a very high price compared with the obvious alternative -- conservation. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that reducing gasoline consumption 10 percent through an increase in fuel economy standards would cost producers and consumers about $3.6 billion a year. Achieving the same result by expanding ethanol production would cost taxpayers at least $10 billion a year, based on the subsidies ethanol already receives -- and probably much more, because expanding production would require higher subsidies. 
 What's more, ethanol production has hidden costs. Even the Department of Energy, which is relatively optimistic, says that the net energy savings from replacing a gallon of gasoline with ethanol are only the equivalent of about a quarter of a gallon, because of the energy used to grow corn, transport it, run ethanol plants, and so on. And these energy inputs come almost entirely from fossil fuels, so it's not clear whether promoting ethanol does anything to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
 So why is ethanol, not conservation, the centerpiece of the administration's energy policy? Actually, it's not entirely Mr. Bush's fault.
 To be sure, at this point Mr. Bush's people seem less concerned with devising good policy than with finding something, anything, for the president to talk about that doesn't end with the letter ''q.'' And the malign influence of Dick ''Sign of Personal Virtue'' Cheney, who no doubt still sneers at conservation, continues to hang over everything.
 But even after the Bushies are gone, bad energy policy ideas will have powerful constituencies, while good ideas won't. 
 Subsidizing ethanol benefits two well-organized groups: corn growers and ethanol producers (especially the corporate giant Archer Daniels Midland). As a result, it's bad policy with bipartisan support. For example, earlier this month legislation calling for a huge increase in ethanol use was introduced by five senators, of whom four, including presidential aspirants Barack Obama and Joseph Biden, were Democrats. In a recent town meeting in Iowa, Hillary Clinton managed to mention ethanol twice, according to The Politico.
 Meanwhile, conservation doesn't have anything like the same natural political mojo. Where's the organized, powerful constituency for tougher fuel economy standards, a higher gasoline tax, or a cap-and-trade system on carbon dioxide emissions?
 Can anything be done to promote good energy policy? Public education is a necessary first step, which is why Al Gore deserves all the praise he's getting. It would also help to have a president who got scientific advice from scientists, not oil company executives and novelists.
 But there's still a huge gap between what obviously should be done and what seems politically possible. And I don't know how to close that gap.

HEADLINE: The Prince, in the City, Dribbles and Scores

BYLINE: By ERIC KONIGSBERG; Kate Hammer and Thomas J. Lueck contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, were a bit later than expected in arriving at the gymnasium of the Harlem Children's Zone yesterday, where two teams of seventh and eighth graders were nearing the end of a basketball scrimmage. 
 At least twice, the timekeeper restored a couple of minutes to the game clock, to ensure that the guests didn't show up to find the game in garbage-time phase. All of which was moot, anyway, because as soon as their royal highnesses entered the gym, play stopped.
The prince and the duchess pressed in close to the throng, shook hands, asked the children questions. 
 Handed the ball in the middle of the key, the prince bounced it once, twice, then attempted a one-handed shot that hit nothing but net (literally -- the ball peaked about a foot below the rim). 
 He tried again and sank the shot off the backboard. The children cheered wildly.
 ''I asked him what sports were popular in his country, and he named some things I didn't even know,'' said Christopher Velazquez, 13. Cricket? ''Maybe.'' Polo? ''Yeah, polo! He said basketball wasn't very big over there, but he'd been practicing.''
 After spending Saturday in Philadelphia, Charles and Camilla headed to Manhattan for a nine-hour, two-stop publicity tour, which began around 1:30 p.m. at the Harlem Children's Zone on East 125th Street, and made its way to the Harvard Club on 44th Street, where Charles received an environmental award presented by Al Gore, whom the honor went to last year. 
 The prince, who had chosen the Harlem educational organization because of his interest in urban renewal, arrived in a double-breasted medium blue suit and black leather lace-ups. Camilla wore a brown skirt, brown suede pumps, a double strand of pearls and a long chocolate-brown coat that despite its leopard-skin trim and beaded embroidery on the collar, did look a bit linsey-woolsey, as they say. 
 Among the men and women who turned up to greet the couple were Lt. Gov. David A. Paterson and his wife, Michelle Paige Paterson, and William F. Weld, the former governor of Massachusetts. Mr. Weld has lived in Manhattan for 10 years, and for the last 7 he has been on the board of the Harlem Children's Zone. 
 As Charles and Camilla moved through a short receiving line in the lobby of the building, Mr. Weld took the opportunity to inform the prince that he was an Oxford man (a postgraduate degree, between Harvard and Harvard Law).
 ''It's very kind of you to tell me that'' said the prince, his eyes crinkling cheerfully. ''Because you know, I went to Cambridge, which is superior.''
 Mr. Weld played along with his guest. ''Well, Oxford is second-best, at least,'' he said. 
 A moment later, when Charles had moved on, Mr. Weld added: ''I actually prefer Cambridge. I really do. Oxford the town is an industrial town. And the luxury at Oxford is embarrassing.''
 It wasn't clear, despite the turnout of nearly 120 youngsters who participated in a tightly organized battery of activities for their English guests -- including an investment class, a tour of the center's health clinic and a math carnival -- that many of the children fully comprehended the significance of their guests of honor.
 ''He's rich and he rules in England,'' Alhamodou Nimaga, 12, said of Prince Charles. And the duchess? ''Oh, so she's Dutch.''
 His sister, Mariam Nimaga, was grateful for the prince's presence. ''In New York, we don't have a prince or a queen, we just have a president,'' she said, ''so it's really nice of him to come here.''
 In a second-floor classroom, Charles and Camilla watched the Harlem Children's Zone theater troupe run through a scene from ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' the play it performed at the National Black Theater for two nights last month. Fittingly, it was the play-within-a-play sequence, in which the six ''rude mechanicals,'' or laborers, perform ''Pyramus and Thisbe'' for Theseus and Hippolyta, the royal couple.
 The actors, who mostly ranged in age from 12 to 14, performed in modern-day workmen's uniforms, but held close to the original dialogue. The prince and duchess sat with their hands clasped in their laps, her legs pressed together, his stretching wide of his shoulders and pointing wider still, horseman that he is. 
 They laughed much more heartily than they had to when Trevor Campbell, a 13-year-old playing Nick Bottom, delivered his show-stealing monologue toward a wall, which in this case was merely a brick that he held in his hand. (''O Wall, O sweet and lovely Wall/Show me thy chink to blink through with mine eyne!'')
 When they were finished, the prince looked to his wife and said, ''Shall we go have a word?'' He then put his hands on his thighs and stood to have a little one-on-one with each of the actors.
 ''He asked me, do I get to do other plays besides this one, and I told him yes, sir, I have,'' Trevor said afterward, beaming. ''He asked if I liked reading Shakespeare and said it was important to perform it as well as reading it.''
 In the evening, Charles received the Global Environmental Citizen Award from the Harvard Medical School Center for Health and the Global Environment.
 The menu at the awards dinner, in keeping with the theme of the evening, involved six courses of ''environmentally sustainable food,'' each dreamed up by a different chef. 
 Andre Soltner, the chef and founder of the now-defunct Lutece, devised the fish course: Maine lobster and day boat scallops en feuillete, with ''sauce a l'americaine.'' Dan Barber, of Blue Hill, got the menu-sweepstakes equivalent of the fuzzy end of the lollipop: cocktail-hour appetizers, billed merely as ''a variety of local seasonal hors d'oeuvres.''
 Under the soaring ceilings of the Harvard Club's dining room, with the mounted heads of an elephant and an elk peering down on them, Mr. Gore and Meryl Streep -- who sits on the board of the Harvard environmental association -- presented the prince with the award. 
 ''When I was a little girl growing up in New Jersey, one of my goals was to marry the Prince of Wales,'' Ms. Streep said, drawing laughs. ''Now, as I look at you through my reading glasses, I have to appreciate you in other ways.''
 When he took the podium, Prince Charles responded by telling Ms. Streep that her remarks ''entirely made my year.''
 Mr. Gore said that he had begun discussing environmental issues with the prince 20 years ago, and had admired his varied work for the cause since then -- promoting organic farming, urging people to consider the consequences of their consumption, and writing and speaking about the need for businesses to be more concerned with their impact on the planet's natural resources. 
 The prince, in his prepared remarks, focused in particular on global warming. ''Perhaps we should see this as a war we simply have to win,'' he said.


CORRECTION-DATE: February 7, 2007

 CORRECTION:
An article on Jan. 29 about Prince Charles and his wife, Camilla, who were visiting Manhattan for a publicity tour, referred imprecisely to the royal title for Camilla at one point. (The same error appeared in the picture caption.) She is the Duchess of Cornwall; the phrasing ''Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall,'' is properly used only for a royal widow or divorcee, according to a spokeswoman for the royal household. The article also referred incorrectly to the necklace she was wearing. It was a triple stand of pearls, not a double strand.

HEADLINE: Tech Barons Take On New Project: Energy Policy

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
President Bush set broad goals last week for the adoption of alternative energy. Hoping to take on the role of filling in the details is an unlikely group: Silicon Valley's technology investors.
 These venture capitalists, backers of giants like Google and Genentech, have traditionally been free-market advocates, favoring ideas and innovation over government intervention. Now they are heading to Washington on a crusade to influence energy policy because they have a big stake in the outcome.
The investors in recent years have poured billions of dollars into alternative energy start-ups in areas like solar and wind power or the production of fuel for cars from feedstock and crop waste. Many of these projects, they say, could stall without subsidies or government mandates for greater energy efficiency.
 These barons of the new economy are not new to politics, though their interest in energy places them in a powerful spotlight. And it puts them in conflict with the oil and gas industries, which are more politically potent and have far deeper pockets. 
 ''It's very different from the business world, where you come in with a good idea and leave with a deal,'' said Mark Baldassare, research director for the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan research group. The question, he said, is whether venture capitalists ''have the patience to be part of the political process.''
 The venture capitalists say they have earned political credibility through their track record of creating jobs and technological change. However, if they are to translate their formula for innovation successfully to the world of energy, they say, they need the government to be, in effect, an investment partner.
 The message to politicians is that ''you have to create a playing field to make it possible for us to back these companies,'' said Nicholas Parker, chairman of the Cleantech Group, a research and trade organization representing venture investors in alternative energy. 
 In recent months, venture capitalists have met with most of the ostensible 2008 presidential candidates, members of Congress, and officials in the Bush administration and the Energy Department, pushing their ideas for things like tax subsidies and efficiency requirements.
 With President Bush's State of the Union address emphasizing alternative energy, and with the ascension of Democrats, who are less aligned with oil interests than the Republicans, the time might seem right for Silicon Valley to speak up.
 Mr. Baldassare and other political analysts said the venture capitalists could become a powerful part of the realignment of energy politics. They are lending a new voice to the debate, one that politicians are likely to listen to given the investors' reputation as smart backers of next-generation companies.
 ''They're responsible for huge chunks of economic activity,'' said Ken Cook, president of the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit organization, noting that the investors are also major potential donors. ''If they choose to get the ear of Congress, they can do it more and more, and they're just waking up to that.''
 Yet the venture capitalists have already been handed one stinging defeat.
 In November, California voters rejected Proposition 87, which would have taxed gasoline and used the proceeds to back alternative energy. The initiative enjoyed much voter support at first, but it was defeated after a $100 million lobbying effort by oil companies portrayed the venture capitalists as greedy seekers of tax subsidies who wanted to burden the state with bureaucracy.
 ''There's a lot of money on the other side, a lot of power and influence,'' Mr. Baldassare said. 
 Lobbyists for oil and gas companies spent $59 million in 2005, compared with the $2 million spent by venture capitalists, said the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit Washington group that tracks campaign contributions and lobbying.
 The venture capitalists say that their research and lobbying helped with the creation and passage of a California bill that Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law in September, capping the state's greenhouse gas emissions at 1990 levels by 2020. 
 When it comes to supporting alternative energy sources, the venture capitalists are backing up their words with money. In 2006, venture capitalists put $727 million into 39 alternative energy start-ups, compared with $195 million in 18 such firms for 2005, according to the National Venture Capital Association. 
 More than a third of the 2006 investments went to technologies related to ethanol, a gasoline alternative that is made from corn and other plant material. Mr. Bush has high hopes for ethanol and other alternative fuels, calling for them to take the place of 35 billion gallons of gasoline by 2017. 
 One venture-backed ethanol start-up is Altra, a 50-employee company based in Los Angeles. It offers a twist on ethanol production by making the fuel from nonedible plant matter, producing what is known as cellulosic ethanol. 
 Altra's process can create ''large volumes of fuel with significantly lower emissions than gasoline, and in a fashion that does not compete with the food supply,'' said John Denniston, a partner at the Silicon Valley investment firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers. The firm invested an undisclosed amount in Altra as part of a financing round that raised $50 million, Altra said. 
 Mr. Denniston said Altra could benefit from policy changes. For example, the government could require that cars be able to run on either ethanol or gasoline, or it could set up a national carbon trading system that would increase demand for ethanol by forcing companies to find greener alternatives to oil and gas. Such a system would put a limit on the volume of carbon dioxide emissions and then create a trading system where companies could buy credits that would permit them to emit more. 
 Mr. Denniston also wants to see a change to the so-called blender's credit, a 51-cents-a-gallon subsidy that goes to the company that mixes gasoline with ethanol, typically one of the major gas companies. He would like that money to go to producers like Altra. And he wants the subsidy to rise when the price of oil falls, or drop when oil prices rise.
 Not surprisingly, the oil companies are not ceding any turf. Edward Murphy, group director for refining and marketing for the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, said the venture capitalists were ''somewhat naive'' to think that they could easily replace gas, oil and coal, which account for 85 percent of energy production.
 The investors, Mr. Murphy said, are begging for handouts from the government because their ideas are not realistic alternatives to oil.
 If a company's product sells for less than gasoline, ''you don't need government help,'' he said. ''Consumers will be beating a path down to your door.''
 Venture capitalists are also facing skepticism from within their own ranks. Some are reluctant to sign on to the idea of any government assistance, saying this undermines the long-term health of the technology. Even those who support subsidies seem to be walking a fine line.
 ''In the past, venture capitalists would say, 'Let the market decide.' But the reality is that sometimes the market needs a boost,'' said Mark Heesen, president of the National Venture Capital Association, an industry trade group. 
 To bring about the change, venture capitalists have begun forming committees and lobbying groups. Kleiner Perkins has formed the Greentech Innovation Network to bring together entrepreneurs, scientists, academics and policy makers. The National Venture Capital Association has a committee focused on energy policies. 
 At the same time, some venture capitalists are acting as lone rangers. The most visible and one of the most outspoken is Vinod Khosla, a founder of Sun Microsystems and now a partner at Khosla Ventures.
 In September he put together a 19-page paper calling for new energy policies -- from mandating that 10 percent of gas stations have at least one ethanol pump to requiring that 70 percent of new cars sold in the United States by 2010 be able to use more than one type of fuel. 
 Mr. Khosla said that since October he had met with senators and House members, governors and most of the likely presidential candidates, though he declined to name names. 
 ''I'm a very small fry compared to the influence of the oil business in the political world. I'm less than peanuts,'' Mr. Khosla said. But he is optimistic about the prospects for alternative energy. 
 ''There is zero question in my mind we can replace all the petroleum used in cars,'' he said.

HEADLINE: At Davos, the Squabble Resumes on How to Wire the Third World 

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
Here in the Swiss mountains at the World Economic Forum, the annual conclave of world leaders, concerns over a growing digital divide this year have taken a back seat to the challenge of climate change.
 Being out of the limelight, however, has not dimmed passions over what the best way is to deploy computers in the developing world. The controversy boiled over on Saturday at a breakfast meeting here where Craig R. Barrett, the chairman of Intel, squared off with Nicholas P. Negroponte, the former director of the M.I.T. Media Laboratory, whose nonprofit organization One Laptop Per Child is trying to develop a low-cost computer for the 1.2 billion children in the developing world. His prototype XO computer is designed to sell for $100 by the end of 2008.
Intel has also contributed significant resources to the cause, including its own design for an inexpensive laptop computer, albeit one that is currently more expensive than Mr. Negroponte's. 
 On Saturday, Mr. Barrett, speaking about Intel's efforts to train teachers to use personal computers, said that it is impressive to see what students ''are able to accomplish with some help from a teacher,'' adding, ''You can literally change people's lives.'' 
 But Mr. Negroponte suggested that Intel executives had engaged in a campaign to discourage world leaders from committing to purchasing his laptop systems. Mr. Negroponte also accused Intel of marketing its strategy to the developing world.
 ''Craig and I sometimes argue, and he called our thing a 'gadget,' '' Mr. Negroponte said, referring to the XO. ''I'm glad to see he's got his own gadget now. Craig has to look at this as a market, and I look at this as a mission.''
 Other executives suggested the dispute was doing little to forge a common strategy to use computing to advance economic and educational development.
 ''I do hear marketing going back and forth between you,'' said Michael J. Long, a senior vice president at Arrow Electronics, an industry components supplier. ''We ought to concentrate on how we can help. The question is what can I do when I leave this room.''
 The dispute between Mr. Negroponte and Mr. Barrett, who was formerly Intel's chief executive and who is now chairman of the United Nations Global Alliance for Information and Communications Technologies and Development, covered both substance and philosophy at the annual digital divide meeting, which has been presented for three years by David Kirkpatrick, a columnist for Fortune magazine. 
 Also present at the meeting was Michael S. Dell, chairman of Dell Inc., as well as top executives from Sun Microsystems and Advanced Micro Devices.
 Mr. Negroponte, who has quarreled publicly with both Microsoft and Intel executives in his quest to give simple portable machines to hundreds of millions of children, has long been known for his iconoclastic positions on economic development and education.
 Recently at the Digital, Life, Design conference in Munich, he introduced himself as the ''good bin Laden'' -- a reference to the notion that his low-cost laptop is terrorizing some companies in the computer industry because of the possibility that it will transform markets for personal computers in the developing world.
 At the Davos session, Mr. Barrett sketched out a four-point program for getting involvement from emerging economies including affordable hardware, low-cost data communications, local curriculum and educators.
 In contrast, Mr. Negroponte offered a vision based on working through children. He attacked projects that instruct teachers and students how to use programs like Microsoft Office.
 ''I think they should be making music and playing and communicating,'' he said. ''It has to be a seamless part of their lives.''
 Despite initially trying to persuade Intel to back his project, Mr. Negroponte has chosen to use a low-power processor from Advanced Micro in his laptop, which was being exhibited here at a hotel near the conference center where the annual World Economic Forum is held.
 It is still not certain whether Mr. Negroponte will succeed in his crusade. At the meeting, he said he now has eight handshake agreements with heads of state, including the recent additions of Rwanda and Uruguay. 
 However, he has also said that he will not begin manufacturing the laptop in volume unless he has firm commitments from one country each in Asia, South America and Africa. Other countries that have expressed interest include Brazil, Argentina, Libya, Nigeria, Thailand, Ethiopia, Pakistan and Mexico.
 During an interview here, he said he now expects firm commitments by March and for manufacturing to begin in April.
 Despite his publicly combative stance with respect to Intel, Mr. Negroponte has apparently moved to patch up his disagreements with Microsoft, and a version of Windows may be available from governments that chose that software instead of the Linux that the One Laptop Per Child organization is developing. 
 One Laptop officials said that the computer might cost $10 to $20 more to run Windows, because of hardware support.
 Separately at the meeting on Saturday, John Gage, the chief researcher at Sun Microsystems, proposed an industry plan to deploy advanced data networks in developing economies with contributions of engineering staff time of 1 percent. 
 Mr. Gage, who headed the NetDay project for connecting American schools to the Internet, said that rural areas in the developing world would cost as little as a $1,000 a kilometer, compared with $1 million to deploy a network over the same distance in New York City.

HEADLINE: Will Bush's Health Plan Work?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''The President's Risky Health Plan'' (editorial, Jan. 26):
 Forty-seven million uninsured Americans is not only a crisis, it is also a scandal. 
 A crisis calls for a response that is equal to the seriousness of the problem, not a half-baked proposal like the one announced by President Bush on Tuesday. 
 Even if his tax-cut plan were enacted and the number of uninsured was reduced by three million to five million, the potential estimated by White House officials, we would still have a crisis. 
 Mr. Bush's plan would be tantamount to treating cancer with a Band-Aid.

John Chalmers
Gresham, Ore., Jan. 26, 2007

To the Editor:
 You write that the greatest risk of the administration's proposal is that small and medium businesses might stop providing health coverage. 
 As a small-business owner, I can tell you that this is true and it's not necessarily bad. 
 The health insurance my company offers is a good plan, but it does not offer the best fit for each employee, and its expense prevents us from offering any retirement benefits.
 Putting the burden of selecting and paying for health benefits on employees would increase their cost sensitivity, allow better tailored coverage and allow small and medium-size employers to provide other benefits that are every bit as critical to the future of our nation.

Saul J. Stahl
Brooklyn, Jan. 26, 2007

To the Editor:
 Your editorial, which is mostly critical of President Bush's health insurance proposals, is very well thought out. 
 But there is another factor in the health care cost issue that you did not mention.
 If more people are to become able to pay for medical care, then there have to be more people ready to provide the care. If not, then medical care costs will go up even faster than they are now. 
 It's Economics 101, supply and demand. 
 What we need are more medical care providers to go along with the newly insured patients, and this is something that cannot happen overnight and will take lots of political courage to make happen.

Lester Ostroy

To the Editor:
 The president's proposed tax credit for health insurance would level the playing field for those of us who have ordinary health policies.
 The only people who will lose are those who have gold-plated policies, like big company bosses and union members. 
 Those of us who have high deductibles and co-payments -- the large majority -- will win under the president's proposal.
 It is unfair to the average worker that big company bosses and union members not only get fat-cat medical benefits but don't even have to pay taxes on them. 
 If the Democrats are truly sincere about looking out for the common man and reducing blatant inequalities, they should stand up to the unions and support the president's proposal.

Christopher Taylor
New York, Jan. 26, 2007

To the Editor:
 Your editorial ''The President's Risky Health Plan'' ignores the possibility that President Bush's health care proposals can be a first step in the demise of our antiquated employer-based health care system. 
 By taxing health care premiums greater than $15,000, the president's proposal will lead families and employers away from employer-sponsored coverage. 
 Already, many mid-size and small companies currently do not offer health care insurance. 
 The employer-based system has given us job lock, where employees are reluctant to move to a more productive job where health insurance is not offered. 
 Even if one has a job but is laid off, or the employer goes out of business, health insurance coverage can be lost.
 Obtaining health care insurance in the individual market tends to be prohibitively expensive unless one is young and healthy. 
 In contrast, under the private, individual-based health system in Israel and the Netherlands, in which there is no employer role, health insurers must accept any applicant regardless of health status and, in the Netherlands, are paid greater amounts by the government for enrolling high-risk enrollees. 
 Universal coverage exists in both countries, with health care expenditures under 10 percent of gross domestic product in each country, relative to the 15 percent of G.D.P. in the United States.

To the Editor:
 Re ''The President's Risky Health Plan'' (editorial, Jan. 26):
 You hit the nail on the head when you wrote that President Bush's ''whole approach rests on the premise that comprehensive prepaid health policies are a major factor in driving up costs; the theory is that people will tend to use services if they are covered. There is probably some truth in that.'' 
 There is; economists have known this since the days of Lord Keynes. Further, it is seen as a good thing.
 An individual's health is primarily valuable to the individual; it is in the aggregation of these individuals that it becomes more valuable to society at large. 
 This is why we call it a ''public'' health system. 
 I fail to see how these ''gold plated'' health care systems do not in the aggregate serve the public good.

Katherine Verleger
Atlanta, Jan. 26, 2007

To the Editor:
 George W. Bush's health insurance proposal to create a standard deduction for health insurance spending of $15,000 for families and $7,500 for individuals will increase the tax burden for everyone, rich and poor, in the long run. 
 Mr. Bush predicts that only 20 percent will experience an increase at the outset of the plan in 2009, giving the reform the illusion that it is benign. But the rate of medical inflation increases so fast that in a few short years, most people on private insurance would exceed the limit and pay tax on a portion of their health insurance.
 Taxing insurance is not the way to decrease the number of uninsured.

HEADLINE: Iran Wants Time To Review Plan Offering Delay Of U.N. Penalties

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: TEHRAN, Iran, Jan. 28 

 BODY:
The top nuclear negotiator for Iran said Sunday that his country needed time to review a plan proposed by the head of the United Nations nuclear watchdog agency that called for a delay in imposing Security Council sanctions if the Iranians suspended uranium enrichment. 
 The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed ElBaradei, proposed the simultaneous time-out plan during the World Economic Forum in Switzerland in an effort to end the standoff between the West and Iran over Iran's nuclear program. The Iranians say their uranium enrichment is for peaceful purposes but the West, led by the United States, says the enrichment could also be used for weapons.
''Time should be allocated to see if the plan has the capacity to solve the case,'' the Iranian nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani, told reporters during a news conference with Russia's national security adviser, Igor Ivanov, who was visiting Tehran.
 The Security Council last month voted unanimously to impose limited sanctions on Iran after it ignored demands to halt enrichment. Iran faces the prospect of additional sanctions unless it stops enrichment within a 60-day period that ends next month.
 Mr. Ivanov expressed optimism that the dispute could be resolved if both sides agreed to Dr. ElBaradei's proposal. 
 As a permanent member of the Security Council, Russia last month forced the Council to weaken proposed punitive measures that would have imposed curbs on Iran's Bushehr nuclear power station, which the Russians are helping to construct. But the Kremlin then supported limited sanctions against Iran over its refusal to suspend uranium enrichment.
 The International Atomic Energy Agency had no comment on the Iranian statements, a spokeswoman, Melissa Fleming, said Sunday. Dr. ElBaradei said recently that he believed that Iran planned to begin work in February on an underground facility to hold uranium enrichment equipment.

HEADLINE: Robert Wilson, Beckett and a Celebrity From the Neck Up

BYLINE: By JONATHAN KALB

 BODY:
A long-anticipated encounter between two giants of avant-garde theater is currently taking place in New York City -- not on a stage but at an art gallery.
 One of the works in Robert Wilson's ''Voom Portraits'' at the Paula Cooper Gallery -- an exhibition (also at the Phillips de Pury & Company gallery) of high-definition video portraits of celebrities posed nearly motionless in drolly theatrical costumes and settings -- is a 30-minute, continuously looped, stunningly beautiful video of Winona Ryder as the character Winnie in Samuel Beckett's play ''Happy Days.''
The collection of portraits (which includes Brad Pitt, Mikhail Baryshnikov and Isabella Rossellini) is the product of a commission Mr. Wilson accepted several years ago from Voom HD Networks, a company devoted to high-definition television channels, which provided the technology and production expertise for the shows. 
 ''Winona Ryder,'' however, a 15-by-27-foot image projected in Paula Cooper Gallery's large, main space, is truly a work apart. It shows Mr. Wilson at his most perceptive concerning the implications of both his means and his subject, and it deserves to be considered one of his most penetrating theatrical creations.
 Mr. Wilson has made frequent admiring comments about Beckett over the years but, to the disappointment of many, has never directed one of his plays. In a sense, the two are naturally matched, since both are known for punctiliously sculptured stage pictures and slow, deliberate action. 
 In other ways, though, they're an odd couple: the maestro of marathon performance with his famously damaged relationship to language might have reason to fear the self-effacing, Nobel-winning wordsmith whose severe verbal economy gave new meaning to theatrical brevity.
 As it happens, ''Winona Ryder'' employs no language. Not a word from Beckett or anyone else. The piece is nevertheless an exquisite distillation of Beckett's worldview, made from some of the most unlikely material imaginable: celebrity and high technology.
 In ''Happy Days,'' a woman buried up to her waist (and then her neck) in a mound of earth fills time, under unremitting light, with ordinary activities like brushing her teeth, telling stories and attempting conversation with her absurdly indolent spouse. In the Wilson portrait, Ms. Ryder, wearing a flamboyant floral headdress, is alone and buried in a mound up to her shoulders, with several of Winnie's signature objects (purse, gun and toothbrush) arranged with tantalizing precision in front of her.
 Mostly, Ms. Ryder stares forward, stock still, occasionally blinking, accompanied by vaguely pastoral, tinkling music by Michael Galasso. As the light in the picture cycles through excruciatingly slow changes, tinting the mound ochre, then chartreuse, then mauve and black as night falls, she gradually closes her eyes and turns her head to the side as if sleeping -- her half-obscured headdress then suggesting a Nefertiti crown.
 Some of the poignancy in the portrait comes from the natural harmony of two major artists, both deeply invested in the literal passage of time and in its use as subject matter. The implications run deeper here, though, because of the juxtaposition of the vanity of celebrity with the memory of a play that famously undercuts human vanity. All Beckett's dramas are ruthless exposers of egotism, the petty narcissism of stars, and Mr. Wilson's Voom portraits turn their own different sort of microscope on stars. 
 In this case, a celebrity notoriously wounded by fame is framed as the pre-eminent figure of vulnerability (and indomitability) in modern drama. In that context, the immortality of stardom becomes an ironic reference, as does the technical perfection of the high-definition imagery. The piece, almost shockingly, forges a meaningful marriage between the most confident of Apollonian expertise and ''the expression that there is nothing to express.''''Voom Portraits'' continues through Saturday at the Paula Cooper Gallery, 534 West 21st Street, Chelsea; (212) 255-1105.

HEADLINE: The World's a Mess, and It's All Your Fault

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
Warning: Your reading of this newspaper may be hazardous to someone's health. (Don't worry -- not yours.) Equally fraught with danger is the casual reach for that morning coffee, the purchase of a new pashmina, a night out at the theater.
 In ''The Fever,'' his corrosive exercise in theatrical conscience-baiting, Wallace Shawn argues that virtually every transaction undertaken by an American city-dweller rests on a sturdy foundation of moral turpitude. Going about our everyday business -- hailing a taxi, scoring a reservation at a hot restaurant, taking a nice write-off for a donation to the opera -- we are condemning unseen victims in violence-ridden third world countries to lives of want and suffering.
So put down that venti latte, for heaven's sake. 
 Mr. Shawn previously performed this 90-minute monologue in private readings, beginning in 1990. Although it later moved on to less exclusive runs at various theaters in New York and abroad, ''The Fever'' essentially and inevitably became a high-end cultural product in its own right, much as Mr. Shawn's similarly themed ''Designated Mourner'' did a decade later in London and New York. 
 Mr. Shawn has amusingly chosen to acknowledge this paradox in the new production that opened last night at the Acorn Theater, directed by Scott Elliott for the New Group. The evening begins with a Champagne reception (Pommery, no less) held on the stage a half-hour before showtime. Mr. Shawn can be seen mingling with hoi polloi, the dome of his bald head bobbing genially as he exchanges chitchat with audience members. (At the reviewed performance, not-so-hoi polloi gathering onstage included the novelist William Kennedy, the playwright Tina Howe and the actor Ethan Hawke.) 
 Think twice before you reach for that flute, however, since Mr. Shawn's aim is to make you regret every sip by inducing a bout of moral indigestion. ''The Fever'' offers an intimate tour of the tortured consciousness of an angst-ridden, well-to-do American, but Mr. Shawn's real goal is to hold an unflattering mirror up to his well-meaning, liberally inclined audience. It's sort of like Joseph Conrad's ''Heart of Darkness,'' with you, dear viewer, cast in the distasteful role of Kurtz.
 But Mr. Shawn's literary models are more likely Kafka and Dostoyevsky, and at its best, ''The Fever'' does achieve the hypnotic force of those explorers of the uncanny. The hallucinatory narrative circles back to a traumatic night spent in a hotel room in an unnamed country riven by civil war. Racked with fever, the narrator replays in his mind's eye a disturbing reel of memories from his past life. Shivering on the floor of the bathroom, as scary bugs crawl around him, he is drawn into an anguished recognition of the interior drives -- and the brutal economic order -- that have supported his obliviously contented, guilt-free existence. His diagnosis: a severe case of self-interest abetted by self-justification, with a smidgen of self-delusion on top. 
 Mr. Shawn recounts this tale from a cozy berth in a comfortable armchair, a setting that neatly telegraphs the ultimate destination of this moral adventurer. He is framed by a truncated slice of a handsome apartment (the set is by Derek McLane), and as the monologue shifts tones, from aggrieved to inquisitive to angered, Jennifer Tipton's lighting moves across its own spectrum, from stark to shadowy to cozy. Mr. Shawn's distinctive voice -- it is as if a clogged sinus is speaking directly to us -- also ranges in tone, from soft, babyish lament to a choked cry of outrage.
 For the narrator of ''The Fever'' doesn't travel a smooth path from benighted indifference to human suffering toward committed engagement in fighting the good fights. He eventually shifts from spasms of contrition for his part in the world's injustices to coolly logical arguments for maintaining the status quo. Regarding the violence and squalor of the countries he visits, he wavers between sympathy and discomfort, compassion and repulsion. 
 The strength of ''The Fever'' lies in the slippery grasp the narrator has on his own convictions, as Mr. Shawn captures with impish wit the tortuous reasoning of a mind trying to find its way back to acceptance of a state of affairs it has discovered to be morally untenable. Mr. Shawn exposes the contradictions and compromises of the urban liberal mind with a mercilessness that is sly and at times hilarious. 
 Despite the density and richness of its language, however, ''The Fever'' doesn't go very deep in its analysis of the fundamental causes of the world's inequities or posit any rational ideas about how they could be eased. Mr. Shawn is limited by the scope of the narrator's experience, of course -- an economist or political scientist he is not -- but the resulting narrative circles around a few basic conclusions that seem thinner and more obvious the more they are illustrated or simply repeated.
 ''My feeling in my heart a sympathy for the poor does not change the life of the poor,'' our narrator unsurprisingly says toward the play's conclusion. At least Mr. Shawn displays a self-knowledge to match his narrator's when he has him continue, ''And artists who create works of art that inspire sympathy and good values don't change the life of the poor.''
 The play's damning conclusion -- that only blood spilled on their doorsteps will bring the complacent rich to change their selfish ways -- allows no wiggle room for incremental but steady progress in alleviating the world's grievous economic imbalances. Its simple finger-pointing at the egoism and materialism of the complacent bourgeoisie seems reductive. 
 More to the point, I think Mr. Shawn overestimates his audience's taste for self-flagellation by a good half-hour. ''The Fever'' would cut deeper into the consciousness if it were shorter. He should know that a 90-minute monologue gives too much rein for straying thoughts about dinner plans and how best to catch a taxi after the performance. 
 And perhaps -- who knows? -- a few audience members might put that half-hour to better use, studying or working for gradual improvements in the lives of others rather than lamenting their own egoism over glasses of Champagne.The FeverBy Wallace Shawn; directed by Scott Elliott; sets by Derek McLane; costumes by Eric Becker; lighting by Jennifer Tipton; sound by Bruce Odland; production supervisor, Peter R.

HEADLINE: As Airlines Surge, Pilots Want Share

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY

 BODY:
Now it's the pilots' turn. 
 The remarkable turnaround of the airline industry has rewarded investors with rising share prices, and the $9.87 billion price tag that US Airways Group is offering for Delta Air Lines in a hostile takeover bid is further proof that the industry is again in favor with investors and lenders.
With most of the industry returning to profitability -- in part by extracting billions of dollars of pay cuts from workers -- pilots are demanding that they should recoup some of the pay and other benefits they gave up in recent years and share in the improved fortunes. The pilots' agenda is playing an important role in the merger talks over Delta. The Delta pilots have backed management's stand-alone plan to exit bankruptcy, and are jointly fighting the US Airways bid. 
 In all, the Delta pilots have $2.1 billion in claims. 
 The pilots are motivated to support management in part by self-interest -- they believe that they would have less job security under US Airways ownership. And that support could be persuasive when the pilots next want something from Delta management.
 They, in fact, accepted a slightly lower price in selling several hundred million dollars in bankruptcy claims so that they could hang onto the voting rights those claims represented to provide maximum support to management's plan, according to people familiar with the pilots' dealings. 
 Delta pilots are counting on the unusual contract they negotiated in bankruptcy to help them recoup their most recent 13 percent pay cut over the next three years by helping the airline achieve certain performance improvements. They also could win profit-sharing bonuses on top of that. 
 Lee Moak, who heads the Delta chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association, said, ''I am confident that the performance-based pay raises are going to pay off'' and restore Delta pilots' pay.
 US Airways was asked over the weekend by some Delta creditors to again raise its bid. The airline has been frustrated because the official creditors committee in Delta's bankruptcy, the only party that can force Delta to allow due diligence by US Airways and otherwise get the merger talks started, has been silent.
 So, according to a person involved in the talks, US Airways management set the following conditions: if the official creditors committee would tell Delta by Thursday to allow due diligence, to also make a filing starting antitrust review of the proposed merger, and postpone a hearing on Delta's stand-alone plan to exit bankruptcy, then US Airways management would take to its board a proposal to increase its bid by another $1 billion. It did not officially raise its bid.
 Yesterday, there were talks among creditors but no word from the official committee, this person said.
 The grumbling among pilots about getting their due can be heard throughout the industry, not just at Delta. 
 US Airways pilots, for example, are negotiating a new contract and seek higher wages and improved work rules. 
 At the old US Airways, which merged in 2005 with America West Airlines, captains on planes comparable to the 737 were once paid $227 an hour, said Jack Stephan, a captain and head of the Air Line Pilots union local for the carrier. But now, after two bankruptcies, they are paid about $125 an hour.
 ''This is truly payback time,'' Mr. Stephan said.
 Southwest Airlines pilots are also in negotiations and want to improve their industry-leading pay.
 Because the industry is thinly capitalized, it remains highly vulnerable to the next economic downturn. So any substantial pay raises could alarm investors. 
 Airlines have tended to enter into generous pay deals in good times and then regret the higher costs of those contracts during downturns. That in part led to the recent series of bankruptcies.
 ''These next years will be the pilots getting something back until they get too much back and then we'll do this all over again,'' said Roger King, an airline analyst at CreditSights.
 At United Airlines, where the pilots' contract runs through 2009, the Air Line Pilots Association has started a ''fix it now'' contract campaign that includes an early strike preparedness committee and an effort to win concessions from management on some working conditions. 
 And at American Airlines, where a contract that runs through May 2008 has already been opened for early negotiation, pilots are protesting a lucrative management bonus plan. They also refused to make a minor concession to help American bid for a valuable route to Beijing, and want to reverse a 23 percent wage cut agreed to in 2003.
 Under federal labor law, pilots have extraordinary leverage over airlines. Their work cannot effectively be outsourced, making a strike potentially ruinous for an airline. And in some cases, by inflexibly following the letter of a contract, they can slow an airline operation enough to cause havoc, as occurred at United in the summer of 2000.
 Only in bankruptcy do managements clearly gain the upper hand on wages.
 Executive compensation is a particular irritant to pilots. American pilots, represented by the Allied Pilots Association, said this month that they expected a stock bonus plan for the airline's 1,000 or so top managers to hand out more than $200 million this April. American would not comment on the expected payouts, said Susan Gordon, a spokeswoman.
 ''There's going to be a visceral, angry reaction, even though we know it's coming,'' said Denny Breslin, an American captain and union official. Pay scales were cut by 23 percent in 2003 and some pilots suffered far worse pay reductions as American shrunk its fleet and pushed captains into lesser-paying first-officer positions, or onto smaller planes, where they are paid less.
 The goal now, Mr. Breslin said, ''is getting our money back -- recapturing our investment'' in having helped save American from bankruptcy.

 BODY:
SHOELESS IN RENO? -- Unisys plans to open its first Registered Traveler program kiosk at the Reno-Tahoe International Airport in mid-February. But it is unlikely that the program will initially offer shoe-scanning technology, said Larry Zmuda, the company's partner for homeland-security-related business. 
In an interview, Mr. Zmuda said the major concern for Unisys was ensuring the program's ''predictability'' for members, who will undergo a federal background check and pay an annual fee to receive biometrically encoded I.D. cards and access to a special lane for expedited passage through the security checkpoint. Mr. Zmuda cited early snags with shoe-scanning technology being tested in Orlando by Verified Identity Pass, which already operates a Registered Traveler program called Clear at Orlando and four other airports. The Clear shoe-scanning technology, developed by General Electric Security, was intended to detect traces of explosives and suspicious metal, and to allow most travelers to pass through Clear lanes without having to remove their shoes. But the scanner rejected an unexpectedly high number of travelers' shoes in Orlando, requiring members to remove their shoes just as they would at regular checkpoints. Mr. Zmuda said Unisys, which plans to be operating in 6 to 10 airports within a year, will probably offer only a special lane for the I.D. cards in Reno while the company continues to study options that will provide more benefits. Steven Brill, the founder of Verified Identity, has said that not having to remove shoes is the biggest potential benefit sought by customers. But Mr. Zmuda said that ''all of our survey data'' show that not having to remove laptops from cases is the biggest benefit sought by potential members.BRITISH AIR STRIKE AVERTED -- British Airways said it reached an agreement with the union for its cabin crews that would avert planned strikes today and tomorrow and for two 72-hour periods next month. The airline had already adjusted schedules in expectation of a strike and the agreement ''has come too late to prevent disruption to the travel plans of tens of thousands of our customers,'' said Willie Walsh, the airline's chief executive.HOTEL BOOM -- The number of domestic hotel rooms under construction or in active development was 23 percent higher in the fourth quarter of 2006 than in the period in 2005, according to Lodging Econometrics. One of the biggest growth areas is in upscale hotels, with 207 of them totaling 23,274 rooms scheduled to open this year, a 35 percent increase over 2006, the hotel industry forecasting company said.A FREQUENT-FLIER CHANGE -- United Airlines has changed its Mileage Plus frequent-flier program. Miles in accounts that have been inactive for 18 months will automatically expire, the airline said, adding that the new rule will enable more frequent travelers to ''compete with fewer people for reward seats.''

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: DAVOS, Switzerland 

 BODY:
The World Economic Forum here in Davos is the kind of place where if you let yourself get distracted while walking by a European prime minister on your left, you could end up tripping over a famous gazillionaire -- and then spilling your coffee onto the king on your right. But perhaps the most remarkable people to attend aren't the world leaders or other bigwigs. 
 Rather, they are the social entrepreneurs. Davos, which has always been uncanny in peeking just ahead of the curve to reflect the zeitgeist of the moment, swarmed with them. 
 So what's a social entrepreneur? Let me give a few examples among those at the forum in Davos.
 In Africa, where children die of diarrhea from bad sanitation, Isaac Durojaiye runs a franchise system for public toilets. He supplies mobile toilets to slum areas, where unemployed young people charge a small fee for their use. The operators keep 60 percent of the income and pass the rest back to Mr. Durojaiye's company, Dignified Mobile Toilets, which uses the money to buy new toilets.
 Nic Frances runs a group that aims to cut carbon emissions in 70 percent of Australian households over 10 years. His group, Easy Being Green, gives out low-energy light bulbs and low-flow shower heads -- after the household signs over the rights to the carbon emissions the equipment will save. The group then sells those carbon credits to industry to finance its activities, and it is now aiming to expand globally.
 In the U.S., Gillian Caldwell and her group, Witness, train people around the world to use video cameras to document human rights abuses. The resulting videos have drawn public attention to issues like child soldiers and the treatment of the mentally ill. Now Ms. Caldwell aims to create a sort of YouTube for human rights video clips.
 Social entrepreneurs like Ms. Caldwell resemble traditional do-gooders in their yearning to make the world a better place, but sound like chief executives when they talk about metrics to assess cost-effectiveness. Many also generate income to finance expansion.
 ''We're totally self-sustaining,'' said Mirai Chatterjee, a dynamo who is coordinator of the Self-Employed Women's Association in India. ''From Day 1 our idea was to run a strong economic organization.'' Ms. Chatterjee's organization now has nearly 1 million members, owns a bank, runs 100 day care centers, trains midwives and provides health insurance for 200,000 women. It is empowering women and fighting poverty across a growing swath of rural India, and its down-to-earth approach is characteristic of social entrepreneurs.
 ''Politics is failing to solve all the big issues,'' said Jim Wallis, who wrote ''God's Politics'' and runs Sojourners, which pushes social justice issues. ''So when that happens, social movements rise up.''
 Muhammad Yunus, who won the Nobel Peace Prize last year, demonstrated with Grameen Bank the power of microfinancing. His bank has helped raise incomes, secure property rights for women, lower population growth and raise education standards across Bangladesh -- and now the success is rippling around the globe.
 One of those inspired by Mr. Yunus, for example, was Roshaneh Zafar, a young Pakistani economist. She quit her job and started Kashf, a microfinance institution that now gives hundreds of thousands of Pakistani women a route out of poverty.
 Ms. Zafar also received help from Ashoka, a hugely influential organization for social entrepreneurs started by an American, Bill Drayton (who describes social entrepreneurs as ''the most important historical force at work today''). Ashoka is one of a growing number of donor groups that offer the equivalent of venture capital for social entrepreneurs.
 ''The key with social entrepreneurs is their pragmatic approach,'' said Pamela Hartigan of the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, which is affiliated with the World Economic Forum. ''They're not out there with protest banners; they're actually developing concrete solutions.'' 
 When I travel around the world, I'm blown away by how these people are transforming lives. A growing number of the best and brightest university graduates in the U.S. and abroad are moving into this area (many clutching the book ''How to Change the World,'' a bible in the field). 
 It's one of the most hopeful and helpful trends around. These folks aren't famous, and they didn't fly to Davos in first-class cabins or private jets, but they are showing that what it really takes to change the world isn't so much wealth or power as creativity, determination and passion.

HEADLINE: World Scientists Near Consensus on Warming

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER and ANDREW C. REVKIN

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 29 

 BODY:
Scientists from across the world gathered Monday to hammer out the final details of an authoritative report on climate change that is expected to project centuries of rising temperatures and sea levels unless there are curbs in emissions of carbon dioxide and other gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. 
 Scientists involved in writing or reviewing the report say it is nearly certain to conclude that there is at least a 90 percent chance that human-caused emissions are the main factor in warming since 1950. The report is the fourth since 1990 from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is overseen by the United Nations. 
The report, several of the authors said, will describe a growing body of evidence that warming is likely to cause a profound transformation of the planet.
 Three large sections of the report will be forthcoming during the year. The first will be a summary for policy makers and information on basic climate science, which is expected to be issued on Friday. 
 Among the findings in recent drafts:
 The Arctic Ocean could largely be devoid of sea ice during summer later in the century.
 Europe's Mediterranean shores could become barely habitable in summers, while the Alps could shift from snowy winter destinations to summer havens from the heat.
 Growing seasons in temperate regions will expand, while droughts are likely to ravage further the semiarid regions of Africa and southern Asia. 
 ''Concerns about climate change and public awareness on the subject are at an all-time high,'' the chairman of the panel, Rajendra Pachauri, told delegates on Monday.
 But scientists involved in the effort warned that squabbling among teams and government representatives from more than 100 countries -- over how to portray the probable amount of sea-level rise during the 21st century -- could distract from the basic finding that a warming world will be one in which shrinking coastlines are the new normal for centuries to come.
 Jerry Mahlman, an emeritus researcher at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., who was a reviewer of the report's single-spaced, 1,644-page summary of climate science, said most of the leaks to the news media so far were from people eager to find elements that were the most frightening or the most reassuring.
 He added in an interview that such efforts distracted from the basic, undisputed findings, saying that those point to trends that are very disturbing.
 He noted recent disclosures that there is still uncertainty about the pace at which seas will rise because of warming and the melting of terrestrial ice over the next 100 years. That span, he said, is just the start of a rise in sea levels that will almost certainly continue for 1,000 years or so.
 Many economists and energy experts long ago abandoned any expectation that it would be possible to avoid a doubling of preindustrial carbon dioxide concentrations, given the growth of human populations, use of fossil fuels, particularly coal, and destruction of forests in the tropics.
 The report is likely to highlight the hazardous consequences of that shift by finding that reaching twice the preindustrial concentration of carbon dioxide will probably warm climate between 3.5 and 8 degrees Fahrenheit and by highlighting that there is a small but significant risk that such a buildup can produce even more warming.
 One major point of debate in early drafts of the report is the projection of a smaller rise in sea level than the last report as scientists relying on computer models and field observations struggle to find a consensus. Some scientists say that the figures used in the coming report are not recent enough because they leave out recent observations of instability in some ice sheets in Antarctica and Greenland.
 Another possible point of contention during the four days of closed sessions in Paris this week may be assertions in early drafts of the report that the recent warming rate was blunted by particle pollution and volcanic eruptions.
 Some scientists say the final report should reflect the assumption that the rate of warming in coming years is likely to be more pronounced than that of previous decades.
 Achim Steiner, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, said the findings presented Friday should lead decision makers to accelerate efforts to slash carbon emissions and to help people in vulnerable parts of the world prepare for climate change.
 ''These findings should strengthen the resolve of governments to act now to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and put in place the medium- to longer-term strategies necessary to avert dangerous climate change,'' Mr. Steiner said.
 In a new report issued Monday, his agency said the most recent evidence from mountain glaciers showed that they were melting faster than before.
 In the past year, international concern over what to do about global warming has grown along with concrete signs of climate change. Even so, political leaders are still groping for ways to tackle the phenomenon. Europe has adopted a program that caps the amount of emissions from industrial plants.
 But the world's largest emitter, the United States, still is debating whether to adopt a similar policy, while developing countries like China are resisting caps on the ground that the industrialized countries contributed about 75 percent of the current volume of greenhouse gases and should make the deepest cuts.
 Many experts involved in the intergovernmental panel's process said there was hope that with a prompt start on slowing emissions, the chances of seeing much greater warmth and widespread disruption of ecosystems and societies could be reduced.
 Outside experts agreed.
 ''We basically have three choices: mitigation, adaptation and suffering,'' said John Holdren, the president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and an energy and climate expert at Harvard. ''We're going to do some of each. The question is what the mix is going to be. The more mitigation we do, the less adaptation will be required and the less suffering there will be.''

HEADLINE: Europe Resists U.S. on Curbing Ties With Iran

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 

 BODY:
European governments are resisting Bush administration demands that they curtail support for exports to Iran and that they block transactions and freeze assets of some Iranian companies, officials on both sides say. The resistance threatens to open a new rift between Europe and the United States over Iran.
 Administration officials say a new American drive to reduce exports to Iran and cut off its financial transactions is intended to further isolate Iran commercially amid the first signs that global pressure has hurt Iran's oil production and its economy. There are also reports of rising political dissent in Iran.
In December, Iran's refusal to give up its nuclear program led the United Nations Security Council to impose economic sanctions. Iran's rebuff is based on its contention that its nuclear program is civilian in nature, while the United States and other countries believe Iran plans to make weapons. 
 At issue now is how the resolution is to be carried out, with Europeans resisting American appeals for quick action, citing technical and political problems related to the heavy European economic ties to Iran and its oil industry. 
 ''We are telling the Europeans that they need to go way beyond what they've done to maximize pressure on Iran,'' said a senior administration official. ''The European response on the economic side has been pretty weak.'' The American demands and European responses were provided by 10 different officials, including both supporters and critics of the American approach.
 One irony of the latest pressure, European and American officials say, is that on their own, many European banks have begun to cut back their transactions with Iran, partly because of a Treasury Department ban on using dollars in deals involving two leading Iranian banks.
 American pressure on European governments, as opposed to banks, has been less successful, administration and European officials say.
 The main targets are Italy, Germany, France, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands, Sweden and Britain, all with extensive business dealings with Iran, particularly in energy. Administration officials say, however, that Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, the current head of the European Union, has been responsive.
 Europe has more commercial and economic ties with Iran than does the United States, which severed relations with Iran after the revolution and seizure of hostages in 1979.
 The administration says that European governments provided $18 billion in government loan guarantees for Iran in 2005. The numbers have gone down in the last year, but not by much, American and European officials say.
 American officials say that European governments may have facilitated illicit business and that European governments must do more to stop such transactions. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. has said the United States has shared with Europeans the names of at least 30 front companies involved in terrorism or weapons programs.
 ''They've told us they don't have the tools,'' said a senior American official. ''Our answer is: get them.''
 ''We want to squeeze the Iranians,'' said a European official. ''But there are varying degrees of political will in Europe about turning the thumbscrews. It's not straightforward for the European Union to do what the United States wants.'' 
 Another European official said: ''We are going to be very cautious about what the Treasury Department wants us to do. We can see that banks are slowing their business with Iran. But because there are huge European business interests involved, we have to be very careful.''
 European officials argue that beyond the political and business interests in Europe are legal problems, because European governments lack the tools used by the Treasury Department under various American statutes to freeze assets or block transactions based on secret intelligence information.
 A week ago, on Jan. 22, European foreign ministers met in Brussels and adopted a measure that might lead to laws similar to the economic sanctions, laws and presidential directives used in the United States, various officials say. But it is not clear how far those laws will reach once they are adopted.
 The American effort to press Iran economically is of a piece with its other forms of pressure on Iran, including the arrest of Iranian operatives in Iraq and sending American naval vessels to the Persian Gulf.
 American officials refuse to rule out military action. On Monday, President Bush said in an interview with National Public Radio that the United States would ''respond firmly'' if Iran engages in violence in Iraq, but that he did not mean ''that we're going to invade Iran.''
 Several European officials said in interviews that they believe that the United States and Saudi Arabia have an unwritten deal to keep oil production up, and prices down, to further squeeze Iran, which is dependent on oil for its economic solvency. No official has confirmed that such a deal exists.
 The Bush administration has called on Europe to do more economically as part of a two-year-old trans-Atlantic agreement in which the United States agreed to support European efforts to negotiate a resolution of the crisis over Iran's nuclear program. 
 Typically, American officials say, European companies that do business with Iran get loans from European banks and then get European government guarantees for the loans on the ground that such transactions are risky in nature.
 According to a document used in the discussions between Europe and the United States, which cites the International Union of Credit and Investment Insurers, the largest providers of such credits in Europe in 2005 were Italy, at $6.2 billion; Germany, at $5.4 billion; France, at $1.4 billion; and Spain and Austria, at $1 billion each.
 In addition to buying oil from Iran, European countries export machinery, industrial equipment and commodities, which they say have no military application. Europeans also say that courts have overturned past efforts to stop business dealings based on secret information. 
 At least five Iranian banks have branches in Europe that have engaged in transactions with European banks, American and European officials say. 
 The five include Bank Saderat, cited last year by the United States as being involved in financing terrorism by Hezbollah and others, and Bank Sepah, cited this month as involved in ballistic missile programs.
 A directory of the American Bankers Association lists Bank Sepah as having $10 billion in assets and equity of $1 billion in 2004. It has branches in Frankfurt, Paris, London and Rome. The United States Embassy in Rome has called it the preferred bank of Iran's ballistic missile program, with a record of transactions involving Italian and other banks.
 Bank Saderat had assets of $18 billion and equity of $1 billion in 2004, according to the American Bankers directory. Three other Iranian banks -- Bank Mellat, Bank Melli and Bank Tejarat -- have not been cited as involved in any illicit activities, but many European officials say they expect the Treasury Department to move against them eventually.
 European officials say that the European Commission will meet in mid-February and approve a measure paving the way for freezing assets and blocking bank transactions for the 10 Iranian companies and 12 individuals cited in an appendix of Security Council Resolution 1737, adopted in December.

HEADLINE: Citigroup to Expand in Britain by Buying Online Bank for $1.1 Billion

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
Citigroup agreed yesterday to buy Egg Banking, a British online bank owned by Prudential P.L.C., for $1.13 billion, the latest in a series of small deals to expand its retail presence abroad. 
 With the acquisition, Citigroup will quadruple its number of credit card customers, to 2.9 million, and broaden its reach by the use of an Internet site to open savings accounts and mortgages in a country where it has five retail branches.
But at a time when the British banking sector has been hurt by a barrage of bad loans and bankruptcies, some analysts are questioning the deal. 
 The cash transaction, which appeared to be at little more than twice book value, follows a string of small deals by Citigroup to buy or acquire stakes in banks in China, Turkey and Central America as well as Quilter Holdings, the British wealth management arm of Morgan Stanley.
 Under pressure from investors, the chairman and chief executive of Citigroup, Charles O. Prince III, has turned to acquisitions to accelerate the growth he promised from a longer-term strategy focused on internal and international expansion. He has significantly cut back on investment spending and has moved to rein in expenses. 
 The changes seem to indicate that Mr. Prince is listening to investors at a time when many outsiders have questioned how long he will hold onto the job. Amidst a management shake-up last week, the bank giant is now searching for a chief financial officer who might be seen as Mr. Prince's potential successor. They also highlight the tightrope that Mr. Prince walks. While an acquisition strategy will deliver earnings faster, one driven by internal growth could have a much bigger payoff.
 Wall Street analysts, meanwhile, have asked whether a series of small acquisitions is enough to move the profit needle at a bank that generated more than $21 billion in net income last year. 
 Reports of a potential acquisition of Egg emerged last month, but yesterday's announcement caught some by surprise. At a year-end presentation in December, Mr. Prince said that on the consumer side, Western Europe was far less ''an attractive acquisition territory for us in light of our opportunities in the emerging markets.'' Mr. Prince made similar comments over the weekend at the World Economic Forum. Executives said that Mr. Prince was referring to the prospects of a major European retail bank acquisition, not a smaller deal. 
 Egg is a pure online bank that could operate side-by-side with a branch network like CitiDirect, Citigroup's high-yield savings and loan Internet offering that it introduced last spring in the United States. 
 Citigroup is betting that its lending practices and broader set of products like checking accounts might spur Egg's turnaroud. Besides being a widely recognized brand, Egg will give Citigroup a stronger foothold for expansion. Citigroup is also planning more Citibank branches in Britain.
 But Egg itself, which was among the first online banks when it was established in 1998, has struggled as of late. The bank tried to expand into France but was forced to abandon the effort. And along with other major British banks, it has suffered from a number of bad loans that caused substantial operating losses. 
 In late 2005, Prudential paid more than $:211 million to buy its remaining 21 percent ownership stake and later vowed to restore Egg to profitability. That never happened, and Citigroup scooped the entire operation up for $:575 million, or $1.13 billion, in yesterday's deal. 
 Still, questions about the quality of Egg's loans persist. 
 Ajay Banga, a co-head of global consumer business at Citigroup, suggested that Citigroup's lending practices could help engineer Egg's turnaround.
 ''They certainly have had an increase in losses over the past couple of years -- it's mostly from a couple of years of customer booking,'' Mr. Banga said, suggesting that the bad loans were made in 2004 and 2005.

HEADLINE: In Queens Blackout, Report Finds Some Fault With Regulators

BYLINE: By SEWELL CHAN

 BODY:
The staff size at the New York State Public Service Commission declined by nearly one-third under the Pataki administration, and the reduction contributed to a failure by the agency to adequately monitor Consolidated Edison's performance, according to a report to be released today by a State Assembly task force.
 The 55-page report was in response to the nine-day blackout that crippled western Queens last July. An advance copy of the report was provided to The New York Times by an Assembly member yesterday. 
The commission, which regulates electric, gas and telecommunications utilities, issued a scathing report of its own on Jan. 17. That report found that Con Edison had failed to adequately maintain and operate its network and that the failure was ''the overriding cause'' of the blackout, which lasted from July 17 to 25 and cut power to 174,000 people.
 Echoing the commission, the Assembly report was highly critical of Con Edison, but it also struck a new theme, taking aim at the commission itself. 
 The report quoted a 1932 speech by Franklin D. Roosevelt, then the governor of New York, who said that the Public Service Commission ''was created for the purpose of seeing that the public utilities do two things: first, give people adequate service; second, charge reasonable rates.'' 
 The task force found that the commission had about 800 employees in 1995, when George E. Pataki began the first of his three terms as governor, and now -- partly due to deregulation -- has about 550. Nearly 40 percent of the staff is 55 or older and is expected to retire within a decade. 
 Though the commission is officially bipartisan, some energy experts have asserted that the Pataki administration mainly appointed political supporters to its board. Mr. Pataki named the four current commissioners, including the chairwoman, Patricia L. Acampora. Gov. Eliot Spitzer has nominated Angela M. Sparks-Beddoe to fill a vacancy and become the chairwoman. The task force also recommended that state law be changed to require commissioners to have a background in utilities. 
 The task force questioned whether Con Edison should have a monopoly ''of indefinite duration'' and recommended that the state review the monopoly every 10 years. In its draft report, the commission staff recommended a formal proceeding that could result in substantial penalties against Con Edison; the new report agreed with that recommendation.
 Con Edison failed, according to the task force, to compensate residents and businesses for economic damages and to follow the recommendations of a 1999 report by the state attorney general after a blackout in northern Manhattan.
 The task force also recommended that Con Edison spend $20 million over three years to develop a state-of-the-art electrical grid in western Queens that would use energy more efficiently and permit Con Edison to monitor the use of energy better.
 Spokesmen for the Public Service Commission and Con Edison said they could not comment until the report was public.
 The task force included three Democratic Assembly members from Queens -- Michael N. Gianaris, Margaret M. Markey and Catherine T. Nolan -- who represent areas affected by the blackout. 
 The other members were Karen S. Burstein, a former member of the Public Service Commission; Francis J. Murray Jr., who was state energy commissioner under Gov. Mario M. Cuomo; Gerald A. Norlander, executive director of the Public Utility Law Project, an advocacy group; Fred Zalcman, executive director of the Energy Project at Pace Law School; and Rae Zimmerman, a professor of planning and public administration at New York University.

HEADLINE: To Mend the Flaws in Trade

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Dani Rodrik, a trade economist at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, received his introduction to the idiosyncrasies of globalization while growing up in Turkey. 
 His father made ballpoint pens, protected by high tariffs from less expensive imports. The company was successful enough that his father could afford to send Dani to Harvard in 1975, the first in the family to study abroad. The younger Mr. Rodrik, a tall, thin, soft-spoken man, still credits Turkey's effort to support less-efficient domestic manufacturers for his good start in life.
''I am the creation of import substitution,'' he says, playfully aware of the incongruity of having benefited from an approach that flourished in the developing world a generation ago and is now widely disdained.
 The experience helped Mr. Rodrik, who is 49, develop a flexible approach to trade. He has built a reputation among mainstream economists and policy makers for favoring eclectic solutions that mix government and the private sector in pragmatic ways. 
 ''You scratch the surface of most industries that are successfully developing export capacity anywhere in the world,'' he said in an interview, ''and you will invariably find a combination of market forces and government forces at play.''
 His specialty is the developing world and he tries, in his travels as an adviser, to help countries improve the mix. Now he is arguing for an improvement in the United States, his adopted home. 
 As a practical matter, he says, Washington must counteract the damage from America's trade policies more than it has in the past. It is a message that is resonating not just with populists in both parties, who have long been skeptical of the benefits of globalization, but increasingly with mainstream policy thinkers, many of them associated with former President Bill Clinton.
 The focus, Mr. Rodrik and others argue, should not be simply on cutting tariffs and eliminating other barriers, but on offsetting the negative effect on wages and jobs from the spread of globalization and outsourcing. 
 ''The consensus until recently was that trade was not a major cause of the earnings inequality in this country,'' said David H. Autor, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''That consensus is now being revisited.''
 He added that ''not everybody agrees with Dani, but at this point there is agreement that outsourcing abroad, in particular, is potentially a source of real downward pressure on employment and wages.''
 Like most economists, Mr. Rodrik believes that unrestricted trade enriches the participating nations, helping more people than it hurts. But in his view, this is not the moment to lower trade barriers another notch.
 The movement across borders of goods, services, capital and production, he said, is ''open enough as it is.'' He would concentrate instead on building public awareness that social insurance and free trade are ''two sides of the same coin,'' a concept entrenched in Europe but not in the United States.
 ''The people who talk incessantly about trade and its importance,'' Mr. Rodrik said, ''do so without recognizing the importance of the social insurance agenda as part and parcel of that process.''
 Unlike Mr. Rodrik, most mainstream economists favor pushing ahead with the currently stalled Doha round of negotiations, aimed at further reductions in trade barriers.
 Still, many Democratic policy thinkers are beginning to embrace the Rodrik argument that trade and social programs must be intertwined. And they talk more about that lately than restarting the global trade talks. 
 ''The best thing we can do for free trade is focus on strengthening domestic policies that strengthen social insurance,'' said Jason Furman, director of the Hamilton Project, a research group founded by Robert E. Rubin, who served as Mr. Clinton's Treasury secretary.
 The goal of the Hamilton Project is to put together economic policies aimed at influencing the Democratic Party's platform. When it comes to trade, Mr. Rubin and his followers want to push ahead with further trade openings, disagreeing with Mr. Rodrik on this point. But to soften the backlash they, too, propose a safety net that goes beyond the education and retraining that was Mr. Clinton's principal response in the 1990s to the damage from trade. 
 ''My argument is that we need to have a new social contract,'' said Jacob Hacker, a political scientist at Yale who is working on a plan for health insurance modeled on Medicare and a program to provide subsidized 401(k) accounts. ''This new social contract won't be as extensive as those in Europe,'' he added, ''but it will move a lot of the responsibility for providing economic security off the backs of employers.'' 
 Mr. Furman, for his part, singled out two priorities: a law that would maintain health insurance for laid-off workers and another that would provide wage insurance for American workers, paid out when a worker loses a job and finds another but at lower pay. The wage insurance would make up some of the lost pay during the first two years in the new job.
 ''People are more likely to support free trade,'' Mr. Furman said, ''if it does not have the intense personal downside that it so often has today.'' 
 For all the similarities between Mr. Rodrik's thinking and that of the middle-of-the-road economists associated with the Hamilton Project, there are some important differences, too. Among them is Mr. Rodrik's matter-of-fact insistence that in the rest of the world, trade goes forward because government plays a decisive role in promoting it. 
 Mr. Autor counters that Mr. Rodrik puts too much trust in policy makers. ''Government does not have special information that allows it to pick winners and losers,'' Mr. Autor insisted. ''So unless there is a specific market failure that requires public intervention, we economists do not presume that government does a better job than the icy fingers of the invisible hand.''
 N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist and a former chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers, puts the mainstream case in the language of David Ricardo, the 19th-century British economist whose initial description of the doctrine known as ''comparative advantage'' still holds sway today.
 ''We in the United States,'' Mr. Mankiw said, ''have a comparative advantage in higher education, financial services, aircraft manufacturing and a variety of forms of intellectual property such as movies and software. Putting our resources into these rather than into areas where we don't have a comparative advantage, such as textiles, allows us to increase the total income of Americans more than if trade were restricted.'' 
 Mr. Rodrik sympathizes with this view, but he nevertheless says that in the developing world, almost no one practices hands-off economics. Government, he argues, often plays a role in creating a comparative advantage where one did not exist before. He made this point at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Chicago this month.
 While several hundred people filled a large hotel conference room to hear a panel of economists discuss abstract trade issues, Mr. Rodrik, holding forth in a smaller meeting room two floors below, explained China's success in concrete terms. Most of the 30 people in his audience were Asian economists studying in the United States or working here.
 The Chinese government operated on several levels as that nation grew into an export powerhouse, Mr. Rodrik said. It nurtured the manufacture of electronic products and auto parts. It forced foreign investors into joint ventures with domestic producers. Beijing lowered trade barriers, he said, ''only after it developed a relatively sophisticated manufacturing capacity.''
 Absent an activist policy to protect China's nascent industries, it would not have emerged as an export power, Mr. Rodrik said. ''The traditional forces of comparative advantage,'' he said, ''would have pushed China to specialize only in the labor-intensive products 'appropriate' to low-income economies.''
 Mr. Rodrik, who maintains his Turkish citizenship and is married to a Turkish woman who also teaches at Harvard, is descended from a family of Sephardic Jews who migrated to Turkey from Spain five centuries ago. During his senior year at a private high school in Istanbul, he applied to Harvard, mostly for the adventure of it, and was accepted.
 ''Like most Turks of my generation I thought I would end up doing engineering,'' he said. But at Harvard, ''a new world opened for me and I started to understand that the problems of underdevelopment were not technical problems in the sense of a lack of engineers or a lack of doctors. It was a problem of social organization.''
 As an undergraduate, he majored in political science but, prodded in part by his father, he eventually entered the Ph.D. program in economics at Princeton. He taught for four years at Columbia before shifting to the Kennedy School in 1996, where he became expert at helping developing countries organize export industries.
 ''Costa Rica is not a natural place to manufacture semiconductors,'' Mr. Rodrik said, citing just one example, but the government ''got Intel to come in and do just that.''
 Over the last year, his travels have taken him to South Africa, Portugal, China, the Philippines. In Portugal, the people he advises are trying to decide whether to invest heavily in vast retirement complexes for elderly Germans, French and British, or whether to make a ''huge leap'' into high-tech industries. 
 Mr. Rodrik encouraged the Portuguese to go down both paths. ''You take into account that there is a lot of uncertainty about what will eventually be successful,'' he said, ''so you try to spawn experimentation in different kinds of economic activities.'' 
 That, too, fits with his own experience in Istanbul, where the family business initially faltered as the spread of free trade reached Turkey. But an older brother, now running the business, shifted to selling imported pens. The transition away from tariff-protected manufacturing was not easy, he says, but his brother, too, was finally successful.

HEADLINE: To Ban the Bomb, Sign the Peace

BYLINE: By Paul B. Stares. 
Paul B. Stares is vice president for conflict analysis and prevention at the United States Institute of Peace.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
OF all the crises facing the new United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, the fraying nuclear nonproliferation system is arguably the most consequential. Mohamed ElBaradei, head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, has warned of 30 ''virtual new weapons states'' on the horizon. Obviously, the more countries that possess the bomb, the higher the risk of a nuclear accident, the theft of a weapon, sales of technology and hardware, and a serious miscalculation leading to nuclear war. 
 So where should Mr. Ban start? With North Korea having declared after its test last October that it now possesses a nuclear deterrent, the understandable temptation will be to focus on Iran. This would be a mistake. North Korea is still some way off from having a reliable nuclear weapon, and to accept its having this capacity as a fait accompli would not only play into its game plan but also convince Iran and other countries that the international community lacks the will to prevent them from developing the bomb. A new approach is required. 
The logical place to look is to examine the lessons of ''nuclear reversal'' -- that is, what has made states in the past give up the nuclear option. At first glance, the historical record doesn't look encouraging: South Africa is the only country that has developed nuclear weapons and then destroyed them. Yet other nations have abandoned advanced research programs -- including Australia, Argentina, Brazil, South Korea, Sweden and Taiwan -- or, like Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, given up the nuclear arsenals they inherited from the Soviet Union. One big reason for these countries' decisions, not surprisingly, was the efforts of major powers to reassure them about their long-term security, so that nuclear weapons offered no appreciable benefit. 
 How would this approach be applied to North Korea? The answer is not unilateral assurances from the United States. American officials have vowed many times that they harbor no hostile intent; repeating that mantra will not make it any more credible to Pyongyang. Similar guarantees from all five of the permanent members of the Security Council, however, could be more persuasive. Enter Mr. Ban.
 The diplomatic vehicle for such security assurances would be a United Nations-sponsored initiative to formally end the Korean War and dismantle the present armistice arrangements. As part of a peace treaty, the principal signatories -- the United States, China and the two Koreas -- would commit themselves to establishing normal diplomatic relations, recognizing the territorial integrity of both Koreas and, most important, ensuring a nuclear-free peninsula. 
 To sweeten the deal, the Security Council's permanent five would extend security guarantees, similar to those given Ukraine, to both Koreas. These would remain in effect as long as each side fulfilled its nonproliferation commitment. If one or the other reneged, all bets would be off.
 Complementary agreements involving conventional arms control, economic assistance, access to international financial institutions and humanitarian aid could also be discussed, but not as prerequisites for replacing the Korean armistice with a permanent peace settlement. 
 The United States has already signaled its willingness to sign a peace treaty -- but only after North Korea verifiably dismantled its nuclear weapons. Reversing the order, however, with upfront but still conditional security guarantees, would provide North Korea with immediate incentives to take the first step. 
 For Mr. Ban, such an agreement would be not only a gift to his native Korea but a much-needed boost to his organization's stature. Above all else, he might just save the nonproliferation system by using the same approach elsewhere, not least with Iran.

HEADLINE: SPITZER TO SEEK MAJOR INCREASE IN EDUCATION AID

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN and DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 29 

 BODY:
Gov. Eliot Spitzer declared on Monday that he would propose a major increase in state aid for New York's public schools in his first budget and would seek vastly expanded oversight of local school districts, including wide powers to remove school boards or force the dismissal of superintendents for repeated failures.
 Laying out an expansive agenda in a speech at the State Education Department, Mr. Spitzer said he was proposing ''the largest infusion of resources in our state's history'' but left a specific number for Wednesday, when he is to unveil his budget. Officials who have been briefed on the governor's plans said he would propose $1.4 billion in added education spending statewide for the coming fiscal year, increasing to $7 billion in added annual spending after four years.
The largest share of that $7 billion -- about $3.1 billion -- would go to New York City. Combined with $2.2 billion in added city education spending over the next four years proposed by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, city schools ultimately stand to gain $5.3 billion a year -- a huge windfall even for a school district that already spends more than $15 billion a year. 
 ''There will be no more excuses for failure,'' Mr. Spitzer declared in his address. ''The debate will no longer be about money, but about performance. The goal will no longer be adequacy, but excellence. And the timetable will no longer be tomorrow, but today.'' 
 The proposal stretches far beyond an order by the State Court of Appeals late last year mandating at least $1.93 billion a year in additional school aid to New York City in its final ruling on a 13-year lawsuit over education financing. The state currently pays about $7.1 billion, or roughly 45 percent of New York City's school budget. 
 ''We strongly support the governor's education plan,'' said the city's schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein. 
 In promising to comply with the court order, Mr. Spitzer had long pledged to provide similar increases for other needy districts statewide.
 In doing so, he said, he would throw out what he called the state's ''byzantine and politically driven school aid formulas'' and allocate money more closely tied to district needs. Most of the governor's proposals will require the approval of the Legislature, where the Republican-led Senate has been resistant to a large increase in education funding and zealously protective of the way state education aid is divided.
 To win over the Senate, Mr. Spitzer's strategy is to pair education spending increases with a $6 billion property tax cut over three years, since slashing property taxes is a top priority of the Senate, which is dominated by upstate and suburban politicians.
 ''These issues are two sides of the same coin, which is why our new educational investment must be paired and enacted with our new $6 billion property tax relief plan,'' the governor said on Monday. 
 At a press conference after the speech, Mr. Spitzer said he fully expected some opposition from the Legislature. ''Does that mean there may be a battle?'' he said. ''You bet. It's fine. We welcome it.''
 John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, was noncommittal. ''We will react when we see the actual budget,'' he said. Among other things, Senate Republicans are concerned about the school funding formula being changed in a way that would diminish the percentage of aid to upstate and suburban communities.
 ''The question is how he pays for it and how he distributes it,'' Mr. McArdle said. He added, ''We want to make sure no region is hurt or disadvantaged.''
 Charles Carrier, a spokesman for the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said, ''We are supportive and look forward to meeting with the executive to discuss it in the coming weeks.''
 While the governor's speech was frequently punctuated by applause, Mr. Spitzer prompted an audible gasp and some boos from an audience of professional educators and Education Department staff members when he also called for an increase in the number of charter schools allowed under state law, to 250 from 100. ''Oh, come on,'' Mr. Spitzer teased the audience. His predecessor, Gov. George E. Pataki, failed to get the Legislature to lift the cap last year.
 Mr. Spitzer's plans for accountability measures will require the support of the Board of Regents, which sets state education policy, and the cooperation of local school districts. Under the proposal, districts that receive significant amounts of new money will have to sign performance contracts promising clear progress in raising student achievement, high school graduation rates and the number of students who attend college.
 The governor said he would seek new powers for the Education Department, including the ability to require districts to dismiss superintendents ''after substantial failure over multiple years'' and even to remove entire school boards that ''fail their communities year after year.'' Currently, the state must get legislative approval to take over a failing district, and local officials can be removed only for misconduct, not for academic failure.
 He said that principals and superintendents would be graded on new ''school leadership report cards'' and that the state should be prepared to close many more failing schools -- as many as 5 percent of all schools statewide -- using its existing authority. 
 In a call for better teacher preparation, Mr. Spitzer said the state should offer expanded alternative certification programs to increase the number of teachers entering the profession without traditional training. And he said it should set tougher requirements for teachers to earn tenure, including ''qualitative information about how a teacher's students perform over multiple years.'' 
 Mr. Spitzer's aggressive agenda included a wide expansion of prekindergarten throughout the state and a more sophisticated analysis of annual standardized test scores to track the year-to-year progress of individual students. 
 But the most far-reaching aspect of the governor's plan, aside from the vast increase in spending, was his commitment to clear up the tangled thicket of state school aid formulas, which have long been derided as unfair and often subject to political manipulation. 
 Under the plan, school districts would receive most of their state school aid in a lump sum, through what is known as a ''foundation formula,'' rather than as individual allocations in dozens of different categories that provide different financing streams for programs like prekindergarten, special education or class-size reduction. 
 Mr. Spitzer said that any district receiving an aggregate increase of $15 million or 10 percent more than the prior year would be required to sign a ''contract of excellence'' setting forth rigorous performance requirements, including increasing the number of students proficient in reading and math and lifting high school graduation rates. 
 He said he would also require districts to increase the numbers of students attending college. ''We must make sure having a high school diploma in New York means a student is ready for college and for the workplace,'' Mr. Spitzer said.
 He also said that local districts would not have unfettered control over how they spend the additional aid, but would be required to choose from a menu of state-approved initiatives, such as reducing class sizes and increasing the amount of time children spend in school, either through longer days, longer years, after-school programsor other changes in scheduling. 
 In his speech, Mr. Spitzer repeatedly stressed the need for accountability in education, but he also suggested that previous efforts including the federal No Child Left Behind law had fallen short. That law, he said, ''sadly demonstrated that accountability without resources is a false,'' he said. ''But we also know that resources without accountability are a recipe for waste.'' 
 At the press conference, Mr. Spitzer announced that he had hired Manuel Rivera, the superintendent in Rochester, as his chief education adviser. Mr. Rivera had recently accepted an offer to become the schools superintendent in Boston, but gave it up at Mr. Spitzer's request. Mr. Rivera, who was named last year's ''superintendent of the year'' by the American Association of School Administrators, is widely credited with bolstering Rochester's struggling schools and avoiding the disastrous results that have befallen Buffalo, an urban district with similar economic woes. 
 ''We are poised to begin implementing what may be the greatest reform agenda directly tied to the largest infusion of resources in our state's history,'' Mr. Spitzer said in his speech. ''My vision for education reform is built on a single premise: To be effective, new funding must be tied to a comprehensive agenda of reform and accountability.''

HEADLINE: Bush Directive Increases Sway On Regulation

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 

 BODY:
President Bush has signed a directive that gives the White House much greater control over the rules and policy statements that the government develops to protect public health, safety, the environment, civil rights and privacy. 
 In an executive order published last week in the Federal Register, Mr. Bush said that each agency must have a regulatory policy office run by a political appointee, to supervise the development of rules and documents providing guidance to regulated industries. The White House will thus have a gatekeeper in each agency to analyze the costs and the benefits of new rules and to make sure the agencies carry out the president's priorities.
This strengthens the hand of the White House in shaping rules that have, in the past, often been generated by civil servants and scientific experts. It suggests that the administration still has ways to exert its power after the takeover of Congress by the Democrats. 
 The White House said the executive order was not meant to rein in any one agency. But business executives and consumer advocates said the administration was particularly concerned about rules and guidance issued by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. 
 In an interview on Monday, Jeffrey A. Rosen, general counsel at the White House Office of Management and Budget, said, ''This is a classic good-government measure that will make federal agencies more open and accountable.''
 Business groups welcomed the executive order, saying it had the potential to reduce what they saw as the burden of federal regulations. This burden is of great concern to many groups, including small businesses, that have given strong political and financial backing to Mr. Bush. 
 Consumer, labor and environmental groups denounced the executive order, saying it gave too much control to the White House and would hinder agencies' efforts to protect the public.
 Typically, agencies issue regulations under authority granted to them in laws enacted by Congress. In many cases, the statute does not say precisely what agencies should do, giving them considerable latitude in interpreting the law and developing regulations. 
 The directive issued by Mr. Bush says that, in deciding whether to issue regulations, federal agencies must identify ''the specific market failure'' or problem that justifies government intervention. 
 Besides placing political appointees in charge of rule making, Mr. Bush said agencies must give the White House an opportunity to review ''any significant guidance documents'' before they are issued. 
 The Office of Management and Budget already has an elaborate process for the review of proposed rules. But in recent years, many agencies have circumvented this process by issuing guidance documents, which explain how they will enforce federal laws and contractual requirements. 
 Peter L. Strauss, a professor at Columbia Law School, said the executive order ''achieves a major increase in White House control over domestic government.'' 
 ''Having lost control of Congress,'' Mr. Strauss said, ''the president is doing what he can to increase his control of the executive branch.'' 
 Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California and chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, said: ''The executive order allows the political staff at the White House to dictate decisions on health and safety issues, even if the government's own impartial experts disagree. This is a terrible way to govern, but great news for special interests.''
 Business groups hailed the initiative.
 ''This is the most serious attempt by any chief executive to get control over the regulatory process, which spews out thousands of regulations a year,'' said William L. Kovacs, a vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''Because of the executive order, regulations will be less onerous and more reasonable. Federal officials will have to pay more attention to the costs imposed on business, state and local governments, and society.''
 Under the executive order, each federal agency must estimate ''the combined aggregate costs and benefits of all its regulations'' each year. Until now, agencies often tallied the costs and the benefits of major rules one by one, without measuring the cumulative effects.
 Gary D. Bass, executive director of O.M.B. Watch, a liberal-leaning consumer group that monitors the Office of Management and Budget, criticized Mr. Bush's order, saying, ''It will result in more delay and more White House control over the day-to-day work of federal agencies.''
 ''By requiring agencies to show a 'market failure,' '' Dr. Bass said, ''President Bush has created another hurdle for agencies to clear before they can issue rules protecting public health and safety.'' 
 Wesley P. Warren, program director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, who worked at the White House for seven years under President Bill Clinton, said, ''The executive order is a backdoor attempt to prevent E.P.A. from being able to enforce environmental safeguards that keep cancer-causing chemicals and other pollutants out of the air and water.''
 Business groups have complained about the proliferation of guidance documents. David W. Beier, a senior vice president of Amgen, the biotechnology company, said Medicare officials had issued such documents ''with little or no public input.'' 
 Hugh M. O'Neill, a vice president of the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Aventis, said guidance documents sometimes undermined or negated the effects of formal regulations.
 In theory, guidance documents do not have the force of law. But the White House said the documents needed closer scrutiny because they ''can have coercive effects'' and ''can impose significant costs'' on the public. Many guidance documents are made available to regulated industries but not to the public. 
 Paul R. Noe, who worked on regulatory policy at the White House from 2001 to 2006, said such aberrations would soon end. ''In the past, guidance documents were often issued in the dark,'' Mr. Noe said. ''The executive order will ensure they are issued in the sunshine, with more opportunity for public comment.''
 Under the new White House policy, any guidance document expected to have an economic effect of $100 million a year or more must be posted on the Internet, and agencies must invite public comment, except in emergencies in which the White House grants an exemption.
 The White House told agencies that in writing guidance documents, they could not impose new legal obligations on anyone and could not use ''mandatory language such as 'shall,' 'must,' 'required' or 'requirement.' ''
 The executive order was issued as White House aides were preparing for a battle over the nomination of Susan E. Dudley to be administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs at the Office of Management and Budget.
 President Bush first nominated Ms. Dudley last August. The nomination died in the Senate, under a barrage of criticism from environmental and consumer groups, which said she had been hostile to government regulation. Mr. Bush nominated her again on Jan. 9. 
 With Democrats in control, the Senate appears unlikely to confirm Ms. Dudley. But under the Constitution, the president could appoint her while the Senate is in recess, allowing her to serve through next year.
 Some of Ms. Dudley's views are reflected in the executive order. In a primer on regulation written in 2005, while she was at the Mercatus Center of George MasonUniversity in Northern Virginia, Ms. Dudley said that government regulation was generally not warranted ''in the absence of a significant market failure.'' 
 She did not return calls seeking comment on Monday.

HEADLINE: Fed Has Yet To Set Target On Inflation

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 29 

 BODY:
When Ben S. Bernanke took over as chairman of the Federal Reserve Board one year ago this week, he brought with him a long-held conviction that the central bank should be more explicit about its goals and less personalized than it had been under Alan Greenspan.
 Yet as Mr. Bernanke celebrates his first anniversary on the job, the Fed is still far away from acting on his major proposal of setting an explicit target for inflation.
Mr. Bernanke has long argued that publicly committing the central bank to an inflation target -- probably 1 to 2 percent a year -- would make its policy more transparent and open to the public. Its decisions would be easier for investors to anticipate, he argued, and the public might have greater confidence that inflation would indeed remain low.
 It is an idea that Mr. Greenspan staunchly opposed, arguing that it would bind the Fed to rigid rules and deprive it of crucial flexibility in reacting to economic surprises. 
 But even though a majority of those on the Fed board agree with Mr. Bernanke in principle, officials have, if anything, become more cautious over the last year about making a change. 
 Fed officials caution that they have to wrestle with a thicket of intermediate issues before making a change. On Tuesday, policy makers gather for the start of a two-day meeting at which they will discuss one possible intermediate step: telling the public more about the Fed's economic forecasts.
 But even that decision may be months away, and Fed officials appear even less urgent about committing themselves in public to a specific goal for inflation. 
 ''There's just not a lot of enthusiasm for moving in any of these directions,'' said Laurence Meyer, a former Fed governor and a forecaster at Macroeconomic Advisers. ''Nobody thought this was such an important issue.'' 
 Outside experts say the caution stems from deeper concerns: a reluctance to change a practice that appears to be working well already; a fear among some that the Fed may become trapped by its own promises; and perhaps a worry about opposition from Democratic lawmakers, who now control Congress and who have publicly fretted that the Fed will focus on inflation while ignoring unemployment.
 As a practical matter, Mr. Bernanke will reach his first anniversary with the economy heading toward the Fed's goal of a ''soft landing'' -- a modest slowdown in economic growth and a slight ebb in inflation, yet with strong wage increases and continued low unemployment.
 The Fed is all but certain to leave its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged at 5.25 percent, and to signal once again that it remains slightly more worried about inflation than slower economic growth. In short, the Fed will continue its ''pause'' in raising rates and is unlikely to reduce rates later this year.
 The outlook for Mr. Bernanke's goal of setting inflation targets is more uncertain. A majority of Fed governors and presidents of the Federal Reserve's district banks support the idea as an important move toward greater openness. 
 Indeed, the Federal Reserve Board now includes Frederic S. Mishkin, one of Mr. Bernanke's co-authors on a book in 1999 that championed inflation targeting. They are joined in the Fed's policy making by a raft of other influential officials who also support setting inflation targets: William Poole, president of the St. Louis Fed; Janet Yellen, president of the San Francisco Fed; and Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Richmond Fed.
 The leading opponent of inflation targeting is Donald L. Kohn, the Fed's highly respected vice chairman. Timothy F. Geithner, president of the New York Fed, is also considered a skeptic. 
 Mr. Bernanke has taken pains to build a consensus before making any changes, and has gone so far as to put Mr. Kohn in charge of a special committee to review ''communication issues,'' including the prospects for inflation targets.
 But even many longtime supporters of the idea predict that the Fed is unlikely to change gears this year.
 ''The Fed has a somewhat odd problem in that things are going so well right now, and it's hard to push for change when things are going well,'' said Mark Gertler, an economics professor at New York University who has worked with Mr. Bernanke on many academic projects. ''In the case of the United States, it's hard to argue that monetary policy would have performed better if we had had inflation targets.''
 Adam S. Posen, who was a co-author with Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Mishkin on their book about inflation targeting, said Mr. Bernanke would need at least a year to build consensus.
 ''Bernanke has to build three consensuses at once,'' said Mr. Posen, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. In addition to persuading the Fed's other governors, Mr. Posen said, Mr. Bernanke must also build support from the central bank's influential staff and with Congress.
 It remains unclear whether the Fed needs legislation from Congress to adopt explicit inflation targets. But many Democrats have been quick to criticize the central bank for not focusing enough attention on wages and job creation.
 Indeed, the new chairman of the House Financial Services Committee is Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who often challenged Mr. Greenspan about rising income inequality and stubbornly high unemployment. 
 Mr. Bernanke is set to testify about the economic outlook before Mr. Frank's committee on Feb. 15. In an indication that Mr. Bernanke will face a more combative political environment than he did last year, aides to Mr. Frank said he was planning a second hearing to get contrasting views from economists and people with ''other real world experience.''
 But perhaps the biggest reason for the slow movement is that Mr. Bernanke's approach may not end up being much different from Mr. Greenspan's.
 In recent years, Fed officials under Mr. Greenspan made it clear they had an informal target or ''comfort zone'' on inflation. For many, that zone was a ''core'' inflation rate -- excluding volatile prices for food and energy -- of 1 to 2 percent a year.
 ''If we asked 10 people who follow what the Fed does, we all know what the Fed's comfort zone is,'' said John Makin, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute. 
 Even if the Fed were to set a public target for inflation, Mr. Bernanke and other supporters have not said how quickly the Fed would need to meet the target. 
 Mr. Bernanke and others now stress that the Fed will not react mechanically if inflation climbs above the target, as it has over the last year. Mr. Bernanke has argued for defining an ''optimal long-run inflation rate'' and originally suggested the Fed should aim to hit that target within three years. 
 But some of Mr. Bernanke's allies now contend that there should be no specific time frame at all.

An article on Jan. 22 about the likelihood that President Bush's State of the Union address would call for increasing the fuel efficiency of cars referred incorrectly to the use of a technology by American and Japanese carmakers to save fuel by shutting down some engine cylinders when they are not needed. It is American companies, not Japanese ones, that are the largest users. (The White House set a target of improving fuel economy by 4 percent a year, beginning in the 2010 model year for cars and the 2012 model year for light trucks, according to materials released with the speech.)

HEADLINE: A Faith-Based Fuel Initiative

 BODY:
In 1975, after the oil embargo, Congress approved the most successful energy-saving measure this country has ever seen: the Corporate Average Fuel Economy system, known as CAFE, which set minimum mileage standards for cars. Within 10 years, automobile efficiency had virtually doubled, to 27.5 miles per gallon in 1985 from just over 14 miles per gallon in 1976. 
 The mileage standards are still 27.5 m.p.g. Except for minor tweaks, Congress has refused to raise fuel efficiency requirements or close a gaping loophole that lets S.U.V.'s and pickups be measured by a more lenient standard.
 Americans who heard President Bush's State of the Union address, including his pledge to reduce America's gasoline consumption, can be forgiven for thinking he was finally ready to change that. But all Mr. Bush really asked for was the authority to set mileage standards in a different way. Rather than requiring companies to meet an average fuel-efficiency standard, balancing gas savers against gas guzzlers, he would assign targets model by model, based on factors like size and weight. 
 As for what those new targets might be, Mr. Bush would leave it to his secretary of transportation to decide. And he asked the country to take it on faith that this new measurement system, combined with technological advances, would lead to annual mileage improvements of 4 percent a year. 
 Our fear is that this program will take far too long to get going, if it gets going at all. Like Congress, the Transportation Department has been notoriously solicitous of the automobile industry.
 But there's a way Congress can get moving. Senator Barack Obama plans to reintroduce a bill that would set a 4 percent annual increase in efficiency as a target, just what Mr. Bush says he wants. The bill would also give both the Transportation Department and the manufacturers considerable flexibility. But the department could not deviate from the target unless it could demonstrate that the costs outweighed the benefits.
 Even that is too much wiggle room for lawmakers like Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative Edward Markey. While allowing for administrative flexibility, they would require a firm fleetwide standard of 35 m.p.g. with no escape hatches. But given the long Congressional stalemate, the Obama bill could be an important first step. It commands some bipartisan support, and unlike Mr. Bush's approach, it promises real as opposed to hypothetical results.

HEADLINE: Awaiting Fed, Market Is Mixed and Tepid

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks ended mixed yesterday after yields on the 30-year Treasury bond briefly reached 5 percent and investors grew skittish a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's first interest rate meeting of the year.
 Merger and acquisition news gave a boost to stocks for much of the session before the 30-year yield moved higher. Merrill Lynch agreed to acquire a wealth manager, First Republic Bank in San Francisco, for $1.8 billion in cash and stock, and Citigroup struck an agreement to buy Egg Banking, the online bank unit of the British insurer Prudential, for about $1.13 billion.
Investors are awaiting the latest reading on the economy and interest rates from the Federal Reserve, which begins a two-day meeting today, and more fourth-quarter earnings reports are due. 
 ''The market really can't find any direction,'' said Todd Leone, managing director of equity trading at Cowen & Company, describing recent sessions as ''rudderless'' in advance of the Fed meeting. 
 In trading yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 3.76 points, or 0.03 percent, to 12,490.78. 
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 1.56 points, or 0.11 percent, at 1,420.62. The technology-focused Nasdaq composite index rose 5.60 points, or 0.23 percent, closing at 2,441.09. And the Russell 2000 index of smaller-capitalization companies was up 4.96 points, or 0.63 percent, at 793.10.
 On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues outpaced those declining by a margin of 11 to 9. Volume was a moderate 1.54 billion shares.
 Crude oil for March delivery declined $1.41 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, settling at $54.01, on speculation that OPEC members would increase production. Shares of Exxon Mobil fell 41 cents, to $73.20. ConocoPhillips slipped 15 cents, to $64.62.
 Denis J. Amato, chief investment officer at Ancora Advisors, said that while the buyout news yesterday could give stocks some short-term strength, he believed that investors needed ''to come to terms with the fact the Fed is probably not going to drop interest rates anytime soon.''
 As is typical with an acquirer, Merrill Lynch fell, down $2.14, to $92.39. The company being bought, First Republic, jumped $15.33, or just over 40 percent, to $53.63. Citigroup was off 61 cents, at $54.06.
 MDS, a drug developer, agreed to acquire Molecular Devices, which makes bioanalytical measurement systems, for $615 million. MDS rose 21 cents, to $17.31, and shares of Molecular Devices vaulted, up $11.19, or nearly 47 percent, to $35.07.
 Bowater and Abitibi-Consolidated, a Canadian forest products company that trades in New York, agreed to an all-stock deal in which Bowater shareholders would hold a 52 percent stake. Bowater, a producer of newsprint and other paper products, rose $5.29, or nearly 24 percent, to $27.44. Abitibi gained 69 cents, or more than 26 percent, closing at $3.33.
 The earnings of Verizon Communications produced a somewhat tepid response from investors. Verizon closed up 20 cents, at $38.03, after reporting that its fourth-quarter profit fell because of taxes and costs related to a spinoff.
 Tyson Foods rose 59 cents, to $17.28. Its profit jumped 46 percent in the recent quarter on increased sales and lower costs.
 In the bond market, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 4/32, to 97 30/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.89 percent, from 4.87 percent late Friday.
 The following are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of three-month and six-month bills.(000 omitted in dollar figures)


	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	Price	98.733	97.482	High Rate	5.010	4.980	Investment Rate	5.145	5.180	Low Rate	4.980	4.950	Median Rate	5.000	4.960	Total applied for	$50,355,212	$45,564,188	Accepted	$24,158,072	$19,953,470	Noncompetitive	$2,109,467	$1,904,934	Both issues are dated Feb. 1, 2007.

BYLINE: JENNIFER RITTNER and BRIDGET ANDERSON


HIGHLIGHT: In this lesson, students offer definitions for common medical terms and determine those that are most accurate. They then prepare quizzes on health-related topics to administer to both peers and adults, and write analysis papers based on their findings. 

 BODY:
Overview of Lesson Plan: In this lesson, students offer definitions for common medical terms and determine those that are most accurate. They then prepare quizzes on health-related topics to administer to both peers and adults, and write analysis papers based on their findings.
Author(s):
Jennifer Rittner, The New York Times Learning Network
Bridget Anderson, The Bank Street College of Education in New York City
Suggested Time Allowance: 1 hour 
Objectives:
 Students will:
 1. Define four medical terms and determine the correct definition for each.
 2. Learn about issues in health literacy by reading and discussing the article "The Importance of Knowing What the Doctor is Talking About."
 3. Create a quiz to determine the health literacy of their peers and adults.
 4. Administer the quiz and write analysis papers based on their findings. 
Resources / Materials:
-pens/pencils
 -classroom board
 -note cards (one per student prepared as outlined in the Warm-Up)
 -copies of the article "The Importance of Knowing What the Doctor is Talking About," found online at http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070130tuesday.html (one per student)
 -resources offering information on health-related topics such as encyclopedia, text books, library resources and computers with Internet access. 
Activities / Procedures:
1. WARM-UP/DO-NOW: Before class, select four medical terms, such as anemia, angina, diabetes, hernia, malaria, schizophrenia or tonsilitis, and write each on a note card. Prepare enough note cards so that the words can be distributed fairly evenly among the class (one word per student). Separately, for your own reference, write the definitions provided by the Merriam-Webster dictionary. In class, distribute the note cards (one per student). Write the following prompt on the board, "Write a definition for the medical term written on your note card."
 Give students a few minutes to write their responses, and then ask them to hand back the cards to you. Read a word and offer the definitions provided by the students and the dictionary definition. Ask the class to vote on which definition they believe is correct for that term. Repeat for each of the terms. How close do the students come to providing an accurate definition? What might their definitions say about their health literacy?
 2. As a class, read and discuss the article "The Importance of Knowing What the Doctor is Talking About" http://www.nytimes.com/learning/teachers/featured_articles/20070130tuesday.html, focusing on the following questions:
 a. How would you define "health literacy?"
 b. What is the percentage of people who are considered to have low health literacy, and which groups comprise this population?
 c. What problems might arise from people misinterpreting the warning labels on prescription medications?
 d. What populations might be most likely to face this problem?
 e. Why might low health literacy lead to more emergency room visits?
 f. How are doctors contributing to the problem?
 g. What steps might they take to improve health literacy among their patients?
 h. Why might having a patient read aloud a list of medical terms assist a doctor in understanding the level of the patient's health literacy?
 i. Why might the doctor-patient relationship be considered unequal and possibly intimidating for patients?
 j. What can patients do to increase the quality of their own health care?
 3. Explain to the class that they will work in groups to design a quiz that tests the health literacy of their peers and members of the community. To begin, arrange the class into five groups and provide each group with a health-related topic from the list below. Advise students that each quiz should consist of five questions. Language, phrasing, and precision are important. Students should make their questions clear, easy to read, and answerable. Formats may include multiple choice, fill in the blanks, or oral testing (such as in assessing pronunciation). They should also consider using graphs, charts and illustrations. Have each group prepare an answer sheet for their respective quizzes that offers clear explanations they can provide to quiz takers who complete the test.
 HEALTH -RELATED TOPICS
 -Common medical terms
 -Patient rights and responsibilities
 -Prescription warning labels
 -Common ailments - recognizing symptoms
 -Common treatments - understanding instructions
 After composing their quizzes, have students jigsaw into new groups. Instruct them to administer their respective quizzes to a peer. Have each group discuss the results and review the correct responses. How might they re-phrase or re-write questions to make them more concise or meaningful? Each group will then determine the two or three questions they feel are most effective and write them on the board.
 As a class, vote on the ten questions that will comprise the final quiz to administer to members of the community. Have students write these questions and answers in their journals.
 4. WRAP-UP/HOMEWORK: Students administer the quiz developed in class to four people of various ages (peer, young adult, middle-age, and elderly) to determine their health literacy. They then write (1-2 pages) analysis papers based on their findings. Provide the following questions for their consideration (written in their journals): 
 -How might you assess the quality of care your subjects might receive based on their health literacy?
 -What suggestions might you offer patients, such as those who took your quiz, to help them improve their health literacy?
 -What suggestions or advice might you offer local health professionals to help them improve the quality of care they provide? 
Further Questions for Discussion:
-To what degree are you, your parents, and your doctors responsible for your health?
 -What responsibility, if any, should doctors assume in helping patients improve their health literacy?
 -How might you assess the relationship between you and your doctors? To what degree do you trust him or her based on his or her role as a doctor? To what degree might you check or confirm his or her qualifications and/or ability to provide quality care? 
Evaluation / Assessment:
Students will be evaluated based on participation in the opening exercise, thoughtful preparation of their quiz questions and answers, and thorough analysis in their papers. 
Vocabulary:
doctorate, annual, optimal, adequately, obstacle, fallout, prevalent, adherence, chronic, socioeconomic, utilization, misinterpretations, dictated, reimbursement, hurdle, impeded, reluctant, realms, clinical, residency, jargon, tailoring, initiative, advocate, reputable, anecdotal, overtly, covertly 
Extension Activities:
1. Invite medical practitioners from local practices and hospitals to the school for a community health literacy event. Organize a variety of activities, including lectures, workshops, role-playing, and health screenings. Write a letter to one participant following up on some information he or she provided during one of the sessions.
 2. Arrange with a variety of medical practitioners (including the school nurse and/or psychologist) to create a health Q&A column in the school newspaper. Invite students to anonymously submit their letters on any health-related topic and have the experts provide their responses. When announcing the column, be sure to clarify the types of health concerns that will be addressed, as well as providing the qualifications of the practitioners who will be responding.
 3. Volunteer at a health care clinic, immigrant services center, or elder-care facility to help those in need communicate more effectively with their doctors and other health care professionals. What specific issues might each community face when meeting with doctors? How can these patients better understand their treatment options and the instructions for their prescriptions? Prepare yourself with appropriate questions and information to help those in your care.
 4. Prepare a dictionary of medical terms with easy-to-understand definitions for patients. Include phonetic spellings of all words that may be hard to pronounce. Submit the finished work to the school's health office for general use.
 5. Translate common prescription warning labels into a different language (perhaps one that is commonly spoken in your community). If possible, work with someone who speaks it as a first language to determine the accuracy and clarity of the translations.
Interdisciplinary Connections:
Civics - Compare national and local health statistics. What common diseases, ailments or health problems affect your community (village, city or state)? How do these compare with national occurrences of the same? In what way might your community reflect a high, average or low rate of certain health issues? What is your community health office doing to prevent or educate citizens about these issues? Prepare a report based on your findings.
 Fine Art - Design a label for a prescription medicine bottle that clearly explains, in words and images, how this preparation should and/or should not be used. How might you use your understanding of health literacy/illiteracy to create a label that conveys important information to those who might misinterpret traditional labels?
 Media Studies - Prepare a public service campaign that offers advice for improving health literacy and/or the doctor-patient interaction in your community.
 Science - Create a "How-It-Works" poster on a human disease that includes an explanation of how it is contracted, how it affects the human body, common symptoms and treatment options.
 Teaching with The Times - Read the Health section of The New York Times every week for one month and clip articles related to a health care issue that affects patients. Translate the information into plain English and create a source book of health information for the public using the original articles and your interpretations. To order The New York Times for your classroom, click here.
 Technology - Create a Podcast to role play a variety of doctor-patient scenarios designed to help improve health literacy and doctor-patient interactions. Invite a medical practitioner into the classroom to act as an advisor, help set up the scenes, and provide accurate medical expertise for viewers. 
Other Information on the Web:
National Library of Medicine (http://www.nlm.nih.gov) provides a variety of health-related information for the public, including the MedLine Plus resource that offers a medical encyclopedia, dictionary, and information about prescription and over-the-counter drugs.
 Health Finder (http://www.healthfinder.gov/kids) offers health resources for the public, and offers a separate resource site for kids that includes an extensive dictionary of health-related terms.

HEADLINE: The Many Roads Not Taken on the Way to Civil War

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
Cry Havoc!The Crooked Road to Civil War, 1861By Nelson D. LankfordIllustrated. 308 pages. Viking. $27.95.
 Historians tell stories. That is their profession. And the goal of storytelling is to impose order on a disorderly array of facts, to steer events toward a conclusion that seems satisfyingly final, even inevitable. In ''Cry Havoc!'' Nelson D. Lankford disrupts the process. He unravels the events that led the North and the South to war in the weeks after Lincoln's inauguration in March 1861, disturbing the time-honored march of history with a series of provocative what-ifs. At every turn in a now familiar story, he suggests alternatives, missed opportunities and roads not taken.
Mr. Lankford, the author of ''Richmond Burning'' and the editor of the Virginia Magazine of History and Biography, embeds his arguments in a slow-motion re-examination of the hectic two months after Lincoln's swearing-in as president. He is interested in personalities as much as in ideas and in the pulse of public opinion, which he vividly represents through diaries, speeches and newspaper editorials. For Mr. Lankford the national drama was a clash not only of political theories but also of personalities and temperaments, starting with Lincoln, whose evasions and vacillations in this critical period only reinforced the morbidly suspicious mind-set of the Deep South. 
 Two big what-ifs dominate Mr. Lankford's compact, engrossing narrative. The first, a hardy perennial for historians, concerns Lincoln's decision on March 29 to reprovision Fort Sumter, one of only two major military installations still under federal control in the seven Deep South states that had seceded from the Union. The second concerns the efforts of Southern moderates to devise a third way out of the national political crisis, one that would keep the upper South in the Union without taking up arms against fellow Southerners.
 The two what-ifs are connected, since the crisis at Fort Sumter directly affected the bargaining power of the moderates. If Lincoln had decided to retreat from Fort Sumter and hold onto the much more easily defended Fort Pickens, near Pensacola, Fla., as Secretary of State William Seward advised, a red-hot political crisis might have been defused and third-way moderates emboldened. 
 ''The Confederates would still have demanded evacuation of Fort Pickens,'' Mr. Lankford writes, ''but removing the Fort Sumter garrison just might have given the upper South unionists a strong enough hand to maintain control in their own states.''
 The internal debate between moderates and secessionists, played out at a special convention in Richmond, Va., that began in February 1861, provides Mr. Lankford with his best material. For long weeks moderates held the balance of power, resisting the impassioned oratory and threats of violence from rabid secessionists. Virginia's struggle was repeated throughout the upper South, which held fast to the Union for longer than anyone had a right to expect, even after shots were fired at Fort Sumter on April 12, an event that produced ''anguished indecision'' rather than immediate rupture. 
 One Tennessean advocated a border-state confederacy as a way to preserve ''strict neutrality between the madmen of the sections.'' This option seems absurd in hindsight, but at the time, Mr. Lankford argues, it did not. A mere seven votes out of 141 at the Virginia convention pushed the state to secede rather than hold a statewide referendum on the issue. What if the vote had gone the other way? In the intervening weeks before a referendum, Mr. Lankford writes, ''passions might have cooled, and even if they did not, the unionists would have taken heart from defeating the radicals.'' 
 Some of Mr. Lankford's what-ifs seem more like who-cares? Small decisions that if changed might have led to medium-size consequences read like niggling footnotes to a story that does not lack for dramatic sweep. But there are plenty of intriguing midrange possibilities to keep Mr. Lankford's historical parlor game alive, especially in Maryland. If Gov. Thomas Hicks had given in to the demands of Democrats and recalled the general assembly in April, after Lincoln issued a proclamation calling for the states to raise militias for war against the South, Maryland would probably have voted to secede from the Union. 
 Perhaps just as fateful were the unintended consequences of Hicks's decision to burn railroad bridges on the two lines that would carry northern militias south to Washington. By making a wide circle around Baltimore, the troops avoided inflaming a city already on the brink of revolt and kept Maryland, however tenuously, in the Union. 
 Almost any outcome seemed possible in spring 1861. One of the virtues of Mr. Lankford's approach is to put readers in the minds of ordinary Americans trying to make sense of volatile events. War did not seem inevitable: most Americans had lived with sectional conflict and inflammatory political talk for most of their lives. The North-South split was never clean. And consequences were never clear. In the euphoria after Virginia's vote for secession, Confederate zealots foresaw a new economic order in which foreign trade gravitated to Southern ports, and cities like New York withered away.
 ''A gilded corpse lies on the shores of Manhattan,'' The Richmond Examiner exulted, as news spread of Virginia's defection. 
 Mr. Lankford proposes a final what-if. What if the eight states of the upper South had all gone the same way? If they had all seceded, he argues, the North would probably not have been able to defeat the Confederacy. If they had all stayed, the war would have been over very quickly. 
 ''The tragedy for the country was that the upper South split roughly down the middle,'' he writes, the very outcome guaranteed to prolong the conflict as long as possible. 
 Of course, no one knew this, or anything else, for that matter. As one newspaper writer put it on April 19, 1861, ''Three months ago a person would have been regarded as a madman who had predicted the present state of affairs.''

HEADLINE: A Rise in Consumer Confidence May Not Last, a Survey Suggests

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Consumers were feeling confident in January: the job market was chugging along and oil prices were down. But their optimism may dwindle on concerns that job and wage growth may slow. 
 The Conference Board, a private research group, said yesterday that its consumer confidence index edged up to 110.3 in January from a revised 110.0 in December. Analysts had expected a reading of 110.0 to 110.5.
The January number was the highest in five years, suggesting that consumers will continue to be the engine behind growth.
 At the same time, the board's expectations index, a measure of consumer expectations for the next six months, dropped to 94.5 in January from 96.3 in December.
 The report said those expecting business conditions to worsen rose to 8 percent from 7.8 percent, while those who expected business conditions to improve decreased to 16.2 percent from 16.7 percent.
 The director of the board's consumer research center, Lynn Franco, said, ''Consumers are not as optimistic as they were in December.'' As a result, the index suggests just ''moderate improvement'' in economic growth in early 2007.
 This should ease fears at the Federal Reserve, which is meeting today to review its economic policy, said Anthony Chan, managing director and chief economist with JPMorgan Private Client Services in New York.
 ''I think this report says they can sit and watch,'' Mr. Chan said.
 The index, which is based on a survey of 5,000 households by the research group, is closely watched because consumer confidence often signals changes in spending trends. 
 January's index reading on consumer confidence was the highest since 110.7 in March 2002 and matched a reading of 110.3 in May 2002, the Conference Board said.

HEADLINE: F.A.A. to Propose Letting Airline Pilots Fly Until Age 65

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
The Federal Aviation Administration will propose allowing airline pilots to fly until they are 65 years old, dropping a 47-year requirement that they retire at 60, the agency's administrator said on Tuesday. 
 The change will bring the United States in line with international practice.
''There's a heck of a lot of experience behind those captains' stripes, and we shouldn't have to lose it the way we do these days,'' said Marion C. Blakey, the administrator of the F.A.A., in a speech.
 ''Experience counts; it's an added margin of safety,'' she said.
 Ms. Blakey commissioned a report on the age issue last year from a panel drawn from pilot unions and airlines; ultimately, it did not reach a consensus but rather laid out the pros and cons of a change. 
 Her decision moves aviation into the mainstream of changes in the work place nationally; many Americans are working longer, some by choice and others from economic necessity. Many pilots are in the second category, having lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in pension benefits because of airline bankruptcies.
 The immediate impetus, however, was the International Civil Aviation Organization, a body affiliated with the United Nations, that recently changed its rules to allow pilots to fly until 65. Ms. Blakey said the rules worldwide should be ''seamless.'' 
 She also said there was no medical justification for retirement at 60, adding that it it was not clear that the rule was medically justified in 1960. Pilots receive physicals every six months.
 The F.A.A will propose a rule before the end of the year, she said, although it is likely to take 18 months to two years to put in place. During this process, the F.A.A. will take comments from the public. 
 The rule will not be retroactive, she said; it will apply only to pilots who are under 60 when the new rule takes effect.
 Ms. Blakey said that she had already received 180 applications for waivers from pilots who were anticipating the change, but that neither her agency nor the airlines had a way to process them.
 The co-chairman of the F.A.A.'s panel on pilot age, Duane Woerth, 58, who was president of the Air Line Pilots Association until Jan. 1, said that in the short term, the change might cut the airlines' training costs. But it may also add to sick time expenses, he said. ''Guys my age are on Lipitor, Vioxx and Nexium,'' he said, naming drugs for control of common health problems. ''We take the cocktail every day.'' 
 Mr. Woerth, who is 58 and on leave from Northwest Airlines, said he did not know if the rule would take effect in time to affect him.
 Mr. Woerth's union, now led by John Prater, backs the current rule; many younger pilots say the current rule helps them advance faster. Mr. Prater said his union would study the proposal.

HEADLINE: From Arms to Art

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

DATELINE: NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. 

 BODY:
Two years ago, when the Noisette Company began its $3.5 million transformation of an abandoned warehouse at the shuttered United States Navy shipyard here, there were few takers for the 14 artists' studios under construction.
 But as years of grime and debris were removed from the two-story concrete building, called 10 Storehouse Row, the natural light once again flooded through the 68-year-old building's clerestory windows and tenants lined up.
Noisette plans to construct 4,000 units of new housing, 5,000 units of rehabilitated housing and 5 million square feet of retail, industrial and commercial space at a cost of more than $2 billion over 12 years on 340 acres.
 Early on, though, the plans for an artists' colony, and not just a traditional mixed-use development, were met with skepticism. 
 ''When we tried to prelease the old warehouse, it was almost impossible to convince anyone that this rather nondescript building could be turned into a regional arts center,'' said Roger E. Noyes, a Noisette director of development for this project. ''These days we have a waiting list'' for the 38,400-square-foot structure.
 This outdated industrial structure (train rails still curve under the huge front roller doors, which open onto a reception area) was transformed into a modern environmentally sound building using green building standards. The wood and other building materials used in renovation came from renewable sources. The individual studio spaces, along with a handful of office suites and a restaurant, are heated and cooled with a high-efficiency central unit and 12-foot ceiling fans are used to move air through the larger common areas that do not have air-conditioning.
 In common areas, high-efficiency lights are regulated by timers and photoelectric cells. And some wall space has been replaced with translucent and transparent materials, like glass and polycarbonate, to add more natural light.
 Last summer, 10 Storehouse Row, along with 56 other structures at the Charleston Naval Yard, were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This status entitles the developer to tax breaks on rehabilitation work to those structures. 
 Many ships were built at the shipyard during the 1940s for World War II, and it was reactivated a few years later during the Korean War. In the 1980s, the shipyard was the home of a Polaris missile submarine weapons facility. It closed in 1996, after 95 years.
 The historic designation has meant that most of the original elements of 10 Storehouse Row -- including a bridge crane in a high bay -- have been preserved.
 Noisette was named after a French botanist who lived in North Charleston during the 1700s. The company was formed specifically for the Navy shipyard redevelopment project, said John L. Knott Jr., the chief executive. He is a third-generation builder and developer, who specializes in planned communities, sustainable development, green buildings, offices and hotels, and the renovation and restoration of historic properties. 
 After 10 Storehouse Row, the company will convert an abandoned three-story brick building next door to lofts. The two buildings will share a courtyard. 
 For many tenants of 10 Storehouse Row, like Lauren Preller, whose digital photo-paintings have been commissioned by South Carolina for several state buildings, the bottom line has been the space's affordability. Ms. Preller, who pays $350 a month for a 350-square-foot studio, said the low rent allowed her to leave a full-time photographer's job at a college and start her own business, called fotopopART. 
 Elsewhere in the city of North Charleston, commercial property rents start at about $20 a square foot. In Charleston itself, the going rate is close to $30 a square foot.
 Among the other tenants at 10 Storehouse Row are Vapor Apparel, a new company that produces a line of athletic clothing; Charles Ailstock, a businessman who rents a studio to paint in during his free time; and the American College of the Building Arts, which rents 20,000 square feet and offers four-year Bachelor of Arts degrees in the construction trades like metal forging, woodworking and plastering. 
 The redevelopment efforts of Noisette reflect a growing demand throughout the country for space in recycled buildings with history, said Bob Berkebile, a principal in Berkebile Nelson Immenschuh McDowell Architects in Kansas City, Mo., the firm that redesigned 10 Storehouse Row.
 ''Sometimes, though,'' he said, ''when an unusual adaptive reuse like the one here is proposed, it's difficult for people to visualize the end product. Then, once it's there, everyone wants to be part of it.''
 North Charleston, which was incorporated as a separate city in 1972 out of a section of Charleston, has been slow to recover from an economic decline that began 40 years ago with growing vacancy rates in residential and commercial areas.
 In addition to restoring the warehouse, Noisette has worked with the city to build the three-quarter-mile-long Cooper Riverfront Park, which is part of the shipyard. It includes an outdoor amphitheater and sculptures.
 The developer has also started to lease shipyard space that is not renovated to artists like Jim Shultz, a sculptor. Mr. Shultz, who works in a one-room concrete block building that was a former machine shop used by the Navy, welds recycled metal -- including sections of the Cooper River Bridge, which was recently torn down -- into sculpture.
 A former car body repairman and mechanic, Mr. Shultz has had work commissioned by North Charleston and by the Testa Corporation, a Wakefield, Mass., company that specializes in excavation, crane and demolition services.
 Arianne King Comer, a textile artist who raises organic indigo for her dyes, uses a small home on the base, formerly part of the Navy barracks for enlisted personnel, as her studio. She is currently the city's artist in residence.
 In addition, the North Charleston Cultural Arts Department has relocated its offices to a 10,000-square-foot renovated building, where nine artists are renting studios. The city is also planning to renovate a 23,000-square-foot former powerhouse with 50-foot-high ceilings for an arts and civic center.
 The housing that Noisette is developing on the site is aimed at attracting a ''more creative, adventuresome and diverse'' group of people, Mr. Knott said. He said there would be a variety of housing aimed at different income levels. The company's master plan has been accepted by the city of North Charleston, but the cost of the housing has not yet been determined.
 The project is being financed primarily by Noisette, but North Charleston has created two tax increment financing districts, which allows it to invest in public infrastructure improvements. The specially designated districts collect taxes used to repay bonds that finance public infrastructure improvements like roads and sewers.
 Noisette's idea of attracting artists has been well received in the area. ''Too much art is accessible only to the higher end of society these days,'' Mr. Knott said. ''We're trying to serve the middle and upper-lower levels to foster more of a bohemian culture. Our world needs that diversity.''

HEADLINE: Barbaro's Plight Shined a Light on Advances

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

DATELINE: KENNETT SQUARE, Pa., Jan. 30 

 BODY:
Even after enduring eight months of searing emotions, the people most involved in attempting to save the Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro said the costly and complicated effort was a worthwhile pursuit.
 In mourning, Barbaro's owners, Roy and Gretchen Jackson; his surgeon, Dr. Dean Richardson; and others in the industry agreed that the experience had already paid practical and emotional dividends.
''I think the most important aspect of Barbaro's fight is that it focused everyone on what our capabilities are in treating serious injuries, of how many options we have now,'' Dr. Larry Bramlage, a noted equine surgeon in Kentucky, said in a telephone interview Tuesday. ''I don't know how much was spent on Barbaro's care. But I do know that if you went out and got an estimate for launching a public-awareness campaign that educated the public as well as Barbaro's situation has, I bet you couldn't approach it for 10 times what it costs the Jacksons.'' 
 Neither the Jacksons nor the officials at the New Bolton Center at the University of Pennsylvania have released a cost figure for Barbaro's multiple operations and procedures or for his stay here in the intensive-care unit of the George D. Widener Hospital for Large Animals. 
 Bramlage, who is affiliated with the Rood & Riddle Equine Hospital in Lexington, Ky., said that facility handles about a dozen operations a year similar to the one performed on Barbaro's right hind leg on May 21, the day after he shattered it in the Preakness Stakes.
 If such an operation proceeds without complications, Bramlage said, it would cost about $12,000. 
 Barbaro had many complications, enough to require nearly two dozen procedures and cast changes. The cost of medicine and round-the-clock care quickly adds up: a dose of antibiotics for a 1,200-pound horse requires seven times the amount given to a human, Bramlage said. One day in intensive care can cost $400 to $1,000. 
 Several horsemen estimated that the Jacksons spent at least $500,000 trying to return Barbaro to the pain-free life of a healthy horse.
 Richardson and his team here employed state-of-the-art techniques that Bramlage said he believed would soon become more popular. The system of locking plates and screws used to piece Barbaro's leg back together has only been used on horses for two years, Bramlage said. Likewise, he said, Richardson's choice of managing Barbaro's pain with a catheter attached directly into the spinal canal was innovative.
 ''I think what the most amazing thing the Jacksons demonstrated was how people will do everything for their horses when it makes no economic sense,'' Bramlage said. ''We run into this all the time, and I'm not talking about Kentucky Derby winners. I'm talking about geldings and lesser horses, and owners who have to worry about putting their kids in school and paying the mortgage.'' 
 Most horses with injuries as severe as Barbaro's would have been euthanized on the racetrack. The Jacksons, however, have been involved in thoroughbred racing for nearly 30 years and have a reputation for going to great lengths for their injured horses. 
 Soon after Barbaro was injured, Roy Jackson acknowledged that his colt was insured for reproductive rights and life. As an undefeated Kentucky Derby winner, Barbaro probably was insured for at least $13 million, according to several owners and breeders. 
 Barbaro would have been valued by commercial breeders at about $30 million if his legs had recovered enough to support him as he covered a mare. Thoroughbred racing's Jockey Club does not allow artificial insemination. 
 John Ward, a third-generation horseman who trained the 2001 Derby winner, Monarchos, praised the Jacksons for sharing their experience with the world. 
 ''What the Jacksons let everyone see is the agony that people in our industry usually go through in private,'' Ward said. ''They showed how much people care about their horses. They made a valiant effort and lost, but not before letting the rest of us see some miraculous medical work that we haven't seen before. We can get to the point that we can start saving these horses.''
 In the short term, however, the Jacksons must decide where Barbaro will be buried. The Kentucky Derby Museum wants Churchill Downs to be the site, and its officials have contacted the Jacksons. The couple said Monday they had not reached a decision on Barbaro's final resting place. They were not available to comment Tuesday.
 Beyond the gains made in veterinary medicine, horsemen said they were touched by the overwhelming interest in Barbaro.
 And just as the death of Dale Earnhardt in the 2001 Daytona 500 prompted Nascar to spend more on research to make its drivers safer, Barbaro's breakdown brought urgency to reducing the number of catastrophic injuries to racehorses. One important change sweeping the industry is the installation of synthetic racing surfaces, which are said to be more forgiving.
 ''In this tragedy, I believe there was some reassurance for the industry that horses matter to a lot of people,'' said Jerry Bailey, the retired Hall of Fame jockey who is now an analyst for ESPN. ''I wasn't aware of the depths of how much America cares.''

HEADLINE: Jury Decides Against Seattle In 1999 Arrests

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
A federal jury on Tuesday found the City of Seattle liable for the unlawful arrests of about 175 protesters during the World Trade Organization meeting here in 1999, a ruling that could cost the city millions of dollars. 
 The jury said the city was liable for violating the rights of about 175 protesters against unreasonable search and seizure, but it did not find a violation of their free speech rights.
A lawyer for the city said the mixed verdict showed that the jury had been confused by its instructions, adding that Seattle would seek to dismiss the case.
 Barring that challenge or an immediate appeal, the class-action lawsuit will move to a damages phase. Seattle has already paid $800,000 in lawsuits and settlements resulting from the protests.
 ''The key point, the lesson learned, is you cannot arrest peaceful protesters here in Seattle or anywhere else in the country,'' said Kenneth Hankin, a Boeing Company employee and the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.
 The trial stemmed from the arrest of Mr. Hankin and the other protesters on Dec. 1, 1999, at a downtown park, where they were sitting and singing patriotic songs. At the time, 50,000 demonstrators had swarmed into Seattle, overwhelming the police and closing down parts of the W.T.O. meeting.
 The park was in a ''no protest'' zone established by the mayor, but officers made no effort to determine whether the protesters had other legitimate reasons to be there before making the arrests, the jury decided.
 In a pretrial ruling, Judge Marsha J. Pechman of Federal District Court ruled that the city had made the arrests without probable cause. Arrest reports had not been filled out properly, Judge Pechman noted.
 The jury's job was to determine whether the city could be held financially responsible for the arrests. Lawyers for the protesters had to convince the jurors that the city had a policy singling out the protesters for their views or that city officials had approved the illegal arrests.
 The city argued that it had legitimate cause to arrest the protesters, that a shortage of manpower had precluded officers from properly filling out arrest reports and that the plaintiffs had presented no evidence that the protesters had been arrested because of their political views.

HEADLINE: Rising Costs Put M.T.A. Projects At Risk of Delay

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority faces surging costs that could force it to eliminate or postpone badly needed projects less than halfway through a five-year, $21 billion program to expand and improve its transit system. By one estimate, the program is now $1.4 billion over budget.
 Among the projects in that program are renovations to subway and commuter train stations, maintenance of antiquated signal systems, and the purchase of hundreds of buses and subway cars, and many of the projects may be affected, officials indicated.
Much of the problem has been caused by a rapid increase in the cost of construction in New York City, as a result of rising prices for materials and the large number of new projects, which gives contractors the leverage to charge more. In many cases, fewer companies are bidding on projects and offers are coming in much higher than expected. 
 Another problem is the weak dollar, which appears likely to raise the cost of a contract for subway cars with French and Japanese companies. 
 ''There's no question that there are serious financial issues confronting the M.T.A. with its current five-year capital program,'' said Elliot G. Sander, who took over as executive director and chief executive of the authority this month. ''We are particularly concerned about the increase that we are seeing in construction costs, and we have undertaken a comprehensive look at the issue.''
 Mr. Sander said yesterday that it was ''far too early'' to predict whether the rising costs would affect fares. 
 The alarm was raised in December, when the president of New York City Transit, Lawrence G. Reuter, in a memo to senior staff members, warned of more than $1.4 billion in cost increases in the long-term spending plan and said rising costs were ''seriously undermining our ability to proceed with major portions of our program.''
 It is not the first time in the authority's history that officials have warned about changing economic conditions leading to unfulfilled promises, but longtime watchers of the authority said the magnitude of the problem highlighted in Mr. Reuter's memo was unsettling.
 ''That isn't chipping away,'' said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a group that advocates for the needs of transit riders. ''That's cleaving. It's a huge hole.''
 The five-year plan, known as the 2005-9 capital program, includes so-called mega projects, like the Second Avenue subway, a Long Island Rail Road link to Grand Central Terminal and an extension of the No. 7 subway line. 
 Mr. Russianoff said he was concerned that officials might push ahead with such high-profile undertakings while sacrificing some of the smaller projects needed to keep the transit system in good shape, like buying new subway and rail cars and making station repairs.
 In his memo, Mr. Reuter said the cost increases put the transit agency's basic goal of maintaining a state of good repair in the subway and bus system ''in jeopardy'' and could force it ''to delay long overdue investments.''
 Mr. Sander, however, said he would protect the system's basic needs, calling them ''the first priority of the M.T.A.''
 Mr. Reuter's memo dealt with the portion of the long-term spending program administered by New York City Transit, which runs the subways and buses. His agency accounts for more than half the authority's overall capital program, with $11.2 billion in projects that involve things that riders see every day, like subway station renovations, and less visible matters, like track repair. 
 In his memo, Mr. Reuter warned that the agency's estimate of cost increases could go much higher. Citing an inflation rate for large construction projects of 1 percent a month, he said that if that trend continued, ''we stand to lose a full year or more of the current five-year program.'' That could translate to cost increases of more than $2 billion.
 Mr. Reuter, who is retiring next month after more than 10 years as head of New York City Transit, refused through a spokesman to be interviewed. 
 Officials at the authority said part of the problem they have encountered in recent months was that projects are attracting fewer bidders than they expected. 
 This is believed to be because some contractors already have all the work they can handle. But it may also be because the authority is in the process of seeking bids for the mega-projects, which are worth billions of dollars. Transit and industry officials say contractors may be refraining from bidding on smaller contracts because they hope to win at least part of a larger contract, perhaps as a subcontractor. Either way, when contracts attract fewer bidders, contractors feel less pressure to bid lower. 
 A prime example is a project for the renovation of a large subway car repair facility in Upper Manhattan, known as the 207th Street overhaul shop. Only one company bid, and its offer of $379 million was close to $100 million more than the cost estimated by transit officials. The bid was rejected and officials are considering whether to proceed. 
 The problems go well beyond subways and buses, however. 
 Tom Bach, the chief engineer for the authority's bridges and tunnels division, said yesterday that it was ''frightening'' to open the bids in October from three established contractors for extensive work on the Cross Bay Veterans Memorial Bridge in Queens and find all the bids substantially over the estimate of about $55 million. The bids ranged from $74.9 million to $86.5 million. 
 As a result, the bids were set aside, and officials decided to split the project into two pieces. The authority will seek bids on one portion later this year and defer the rest of the work until after 2009. The Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North have also seen cost increases. 
 Mr. Bach said that his division had yet to award contracts for what had been estimated as $400 million worth of projects under the capital program, and that he now expected the work to cost $40 million more. 
 Mr. Sander said the authority would explore a number of ways to hold the spending plan together. That could include splitting more projects into smaller pieces in hopes of drawing more bidders into the process. 
 ''We need to see if we can drive costs down,'' Mr. Sander said. ''We need to review the existing scope for these projects to make sure they're not gold-plated, and we have to see if there are additional revenue sources to support any uncontrollable cost increases in these projects.''
 With questions emerging over the long-term spending plan, Mr. Sander has assumed control of an authority that now appears to be facing a twofold financial quandary. The agency's day-to-day operating budget -- which is administered separately from the long-term financing -- is expected to have a surplus this year, but projections call for large operating deficits beginning next year.

HEADLINE: Accord on Increasing Pell Grants

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
The maximum federal grant for middle- and low-income students to attend college would increase for the first time in four years under a catchall spending bill that House and Senate Democrats agreed to on Tuesday. 
 The measure would complete budget issues left over from 2006.
The increase, announced by the chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, would raise the maximum grants, under the Pell program, to $4,310 a year from $4,050. The last substantial increase in the grants was in 2001.
 Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the Senate education committee, called the increase ''an important down payment by Democrats on our commitment to help families with high college costs.''
 The move follows a vote by the House, under the Democrats' agenda in the new Congress, to cut interest rates on some subsidized loans for middle- and lower-income students. 
 Although the rate cut passed with overwhelming bipartisan support, that bill was criticized by House Republicans and the Bush administration as benefiting just college graduates faced with repaying loans, rather than broadening access to college for low-income students.
 With the announcement on Tuesday, days before President Bush is to release his 2008 budget, Democrats appeared to answer that criticism, part of a broader effort to claim the issue of college affordability. 
 Even if the president asks for an increase in Pell Grants, as the White House has indicated is likely, Democrats will have already acted to increase the grants.
 Republicans generally appeared to support increasing the grants.
 Each year, 5.3 million students with family incomes less than $40,000 a year receive the grants. Although the grants have remained steady, the cost of attending college has outpaced inflation, lowering the buying power of the grants. 
 The budget bill would increase federal grant money by $615.4 million, to $13.6 billion for this year.
 An advocate for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group Higher Education Project, Luke Swarthout, said the increase was significant, though students had hoped for a much larger increase.

HEADLINE: History Teacher Becomes Podcast Celebrity With Tales of the Byzantine Empire

BYLINE: By SAMUEL G. FREEDMAN. 
E-mail: sgfreedman@nytimes.com

DATELINE: STONY BROOK, N.Y. 

 BODY:
Fourth period on a midwinter Thursday, Christmas vacation a fading memory by now, and Lars Brownworth took his accustomed place in front of an American history class at the Stony Brook School here. He had been guiding these seniors through the Gilded Age lately, and for this session he planned to personify the era in the form of the oil tycoon John D. Rockefeller.
 For 45 minutes, Mr. Brownworth deftly orchestrated lecture, discussion and archival photographs to evoke Rockefeller in both his rapacious capitalism and social conscience. When the bell rang, out shuffled the audience, a dozen teenagers who might or might not remember any of this material beyond the next exam. In its satisfactions and its limits, such was the life Mr. Brownworth, the son of teachers, had gladly chosen.
That night, though, Mr. Brownworth, 31, set to work in his own apartment, writing an essay about Alexius I Comnenus, the Byzantine emperor from 1081 to 1118. After revision and rehearsal, the text would become the script for the latest installment of Mr. Brownworth's podcast. And if form held, something like 140,000 listeners from Afghanistan to White Plains would hear it. 
 In barely 18 months, Mr. Brownworth's podcast, ''12 Byzantine Rulers'' (at http://www.anders.com/lectures/lars--brownworth/12--byzantine--rulers/), has become one of the phenomena of the podcasting world. A survey of 1,200 years of rather abstruse history, starting with Diocletian in 284 and finishing with Constantine XI Palaeologus in 1453, ''12 Byzantine Rulers'' routinely ranks in the top five educational podcasts on iTunes, and in the top 50 of all podcasts.
 In the digital era, this self-taught amateur has emerged as a figure somewhat akin to Will Durant in books or Jacob Bronowski on public television, an effective and engaging popularizer. Mr. Brownworth's podcast competes favorably with far more conventional and credentialed online fare -- university courses in beginning French or Psychology 101, test-prep drills for the SAT. Even the other highly rated personal podcasts, like ''Word Nerds'' and ''Grammar Girl,'' appeal to dependably large audiences for etymology and grammar.
 ''It's a slightly frightening idea to think there are so many people,'' Mr. Brownworth said. ''But without question it's the most exciting part of my professional life. We're in the middle of a revolution, and I feel incredibly blessed to be part of it.''
 While listeners address him in their e-mail messages with the respectful honorific ''Professor,'' Mr. Brownworth, in fact, holds only a bachelor's degree in history, from Houghton College in upstate New York. He started teaching at Stony Brook, an independent school, only in 1999, and his initial assignment was in the science department. To the extent that he had any specialty as an undergraduate, it was the Battle of Hastings, a long way from Constantinople.
 What Mr. Brownworth always possessed was a sweeping intellectual curiosity about antiquity, which inspired him while he was growing up on Long Island to learn to read hieroglyphics and sound out the Greek inscriptions in the ruins of Herculaneum. He also had a talent for dramatizing himself, whether donning the set of armor owned by family friends or imitating characters from a firefighter to a gorilla in a series of home movies called ''Lars's World.''
 Still, Mr. Brownworth had fallen into the passive assumption that between Rome's fall and the Renaissance there existed nothing but barbarism. It took a casual mention of a Byzantine empress in a book about Charlemagne that he read a few years ago for Mr. Brownworth's curiosity to be kindled. He followed it into such standard texts as ''A History of the Byzantine State'' by George Ostrogorsky and ''The Fall of Constantinople'' by Steven Runciman. On a school trip to Turkey, he walked into the very church where every Byzantine emperor had been crowned.
 ''There was something mysterious about the Byzantine empire to me, this sense that it was lost history,'' Mr. Brownworth recalled. ''America is very much a Protestant country, and we really don't feel like we're connected to the Eastern world, that we don't share values. But it's not a coincidence that the Renaissance kicks off after the fall of Constantinople. A lot of those Greek-speaking intellectuals fled to the West, bringing their knowledge of the classics. That knowledge had been kept alive with the Byzantines.''
 BEYOND all the highbrow stuff, Mr. Brownworth also found plenty of blood and gore. He shared much of it with his older brother, Anders. Did he know that after the Bulgarians killed the Byzantine emperor Romanus they used his skull as a mug? (Cool!) Did he know that Emperor Basil gouged out the eyes of his Bulgarian enemies, leaving just a handful with sight to lead the defeated army back home. (Awesome, dude!)
 An executive at a technology company in North Carolina, Anders persuaded his brother in 2004 to write and record a brief lecture giving an overview of the Byzantine era. Then Anders posted it on his personal Web site. And nobody in the outside world paid the slightest attention.
 But on the day in June 2005 when Apple began presenting podcasts on iTunes, while Lars was on an archaeological dig in Jordan, Anders put up the recording. A month later, 1,392 people downloaded it, and Anders told Lars, ''I think you better do another show.'' By July 2006, 41,031 listeners subscribed. Last December, after being cited by both Apple and Wired magazine as one of the nation's most influential podcasts, ''12 Byzantine Rulers'' drew 140,910 hits.
 One listener is Christopher Roe, who was helping to build fire stations in the Afghan province of Khost last July when he alighted on ''12 Byzantine Rulers.'' After listening to a half-dozen segments, he decided to enroll for a master's degree in history, concentrating on the Byzantine Empire. Now back in the United States, he is doing exactly that at Central Michigan University.
 And there is Howard Moskowitz, a marketing executive in White Plains, always eager for something diverting to listen to on the treadmill or in the dentist's chair. ''This was the most marvelous series,'' he said of Mr. Brownworth's podcasts. ''The English is exquisite. It's not florid, it's not self-indulgent. It's a fascinating period of time no one pays attention to. And it's free. Let's not ignore homo economicus.''
 With 13 episodes completed, Mr. Brownworth said he expected to complete and post the last four by the summer. Some other topic, he's not yet sure what, will come next. For someone used to teaching students by the dozen, life as a rock star still feels strange.
 ''I can't believe it's that many people,'' he said of his global audience. ''I always thought the only one listening was going to be me.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Urged To Step Up Plan to Attract More Visitors

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
One year after the Bush administration vowed to try to slow the decline of overseas visitors to the United States, travel industry executives and some Democratic lawmakers say that the initiative needs to be stepped up. 
 The lawmakers and executives point to continuing delays in processing visas, staff shortages at international airports here and American consulates abroad and what they describe as a failure to promote the United States adequately as a travel destination since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Officials at the Departments of State and Homeland Security counter that they have already made significant progress in addressing such problems. But Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii and chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and Senator Byron L. Dorgan, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the tourism subcommittee, say legislation is needed to prod the administration to do more. 
 ''Announcing a new initiative is the easy part,'' Mr. Dorgan said of the administration's plan, which is intended to encourage tourism and business travel. ''The follow-through is what is important. And the fact is the results so far have been less than impressive.''
 Between 2000 and 2005, the number of overseas visitors dipped from 26 million annually to 21 million, according to the Travel Industry Association. In some places in Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic, travelers still wait nearly two months or more to get an interview for a visa, State Department statistics show. And travel industry executives say that an effort to transform the Houston and Dulles international airports into model airports has made ''marginal progress.'' 
 An association of travel industry executives, called the Discover America Partnership, has hired Tom Ridge, the first homeland security secretary, to help promote its efforts.
 The group includes Jay Rasulo, chairman of Walt Disney Resorts and Parks; Jonathan M. Tisch, chairman of Loews Hotels; and Roger Dow, president of the Travel Industry Association. The travel executives are calling for legislation that would increase financing for consular and airport staff and require the administration to report to Congress on its efforts to improve visa processing and customer service at customs checkpoints, among other things.
 Mr. Dorgan, who will hold a hearing on the issue on Wednesday, praised the partnership's proposals and said he and other lawmakers would consider them as they drafted legislation. ''Other countries have become more aggressive while we have become less aggressive,'' he said. ''It seems to me we ought to change that.''
 Maura Harty, assistant secretary for consular affairs in the State Department, said critics failed to acknowledge progress that had been made. In September 2006, 47 of the 219 American embassies and consulates that handle nonimmigrant visas had wait times of 30 days or more for visa interviews. Now, she said, only 20 of the postings have wait times of that length.
 Ms. Harty noted that the number of business visas issued in Brazil had surged by 70 percent over the past year and that the number of student visas had increased by 32 percent in China and 30 percent in India. In the meantime, she said, the State Department was testing video conferencing of interviews and mobile consular units in remote locations. 
 She expressed disappointment that such achievements were not recognized. ''We have in essence been changing out the engine while the aircraft is in midflight,'' she said. ''We have enhanced our service delivery.'' 
 Jarrod Agen, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, echoed her concerns. He said his department was pressing ahead with legislation that would expand the number of countries where travelers are not required to apply for visas in exchange for tougher security reviews of those travelers, among other changes. 
 ''A number of the points are areas where we're already working to improve and have made strides,'' Mr. Agen said.
 Stevan Porter, the chairman of the Discover America Partnership, said more needed to be done. ''America is experiencing a travel crisis, one that hurts our economy, national security and global standing,'' said Mr. Porter, who is also the president of the Intercontinental Hotels Group.
 Mr. Ridge said a concerted effort was needed to make sure that America was viewed as a welcoming destination. ''I suspect every congressman, senator, ambassador, business leader as well as thousands of individuals citizens have a litany of anecdotes that confirm that it is more difficult traveling to this country,'' Mr. Ridge said.

HEADLINE: Democrats' Spending Plan Would Raise Some Budgets

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
Education, veterans' health care, international AIDS relief and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are among the government programs that would receive more money this year under a spending plan released Tuesday by House Democrats. 
 The House is scheduled to vote Wednesday on the $463.5 billion spending bill.
The measure, if passed and signed into law, would deliver the budgets that federal agencies have been awaiting for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The government has been operating on a stopgap spending measure that expires Feb. 15.
 The chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, said the measure would leave most federal programs near last year's financing levels, drop thousands of pet projects known as earmarks and give larger increases to a few programs backed by Democrats or deemed to be in need of more money.
 ''I don't expect people to love this proposal -- I don't love this proposal,'' Mr. Obey said in an e-mailed statement. ''But in contrast to last year's Congress, which decided to duck these choices, at least we have made them in order to bring last year's issues to a conclusion so we can turn the page and deal with next year's priorities.''
 The legislation was greeted with complaints from Republicans who said they had been given little opportunity to amend or debate a measure that would provide almost half of the government's discretionary budget.
 ''It is legislation that few have seen, which we are informed by the majority leader will not be able to be amended and that will pass the House after only one hour of debate,'' said Representative Jerry Lewis, Republican of California and the ranking minority member of the Appropriations Committee.
 Mr. Obey dismissed the complaints, saying the overdue spending measures should have been completed last year when Republicans were in charge.
 The plan would increase financing for veterans' health care by $3.6 billion, to $32.3 billion. 
 The budget for the National Institutes of Health would expand by $620 million, to $28.9 billion. The National Science Foundation would get an additional $335 million, for a total of $4.7 billion. 
 The Office of Science in the Department of Energy would get an additional $200 million. The F.B.I.'s budget would grow by $217 million, to $6 billion.
 Financing for prison construction would jump by $343 million, to $432 million. Efforts to combat AIDS abroad would get an additional $1.3 billion, for a total of $4.5 billion.
 The plan would cut the budgets of more than 60 programs from last year's level of spending. 
 Most programs would see their budgets frozen at current levels, with small increases to accommodate required raises for government employees. Critics have said that would amount to a cut once inflation and other additional costs are considered.

HEADLINE: F.D.A. Installs Drug Reviews at 18 Months; Critics Say More Changes Are Needed

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

 BODY:
The Food and Drug Administration announced changes yesterday that were intended to ensure that marketed drugs are as safe as advertised, including the first effort to do a comprehensive assessment of the safety of drugs 18 months after introduction. 
 The agency also announced the creation of an advisory panel to improve the way it announces safety worries and a collaboration with the Veterans Health Administration to track how real patients fare after taking drugs.
 The F.D.A. plan is the latest effort to fix the agency after a series of missteps. In September 2004, Merck withdrew its arthritis drug, Vioxx, after a study showed that it doubled the risks of heart attack. About the same time, the agency announced that antidepressants cause some teenagers to think more about suicide. 
 In both cases, the agency took years to acknowledge risks to millions of patients that had been apparent to some researchers.
 ''We don't see this as the only answer,'' said Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach, the F.D.A. commissioner, at a news conference in Washington announcing the initiatives. ''It's merely a step as we continue a process of improvement that will be ongoing.'' 
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, said in a written statement that far greater changes were needed at the agency. Mr. Dodd promised to introduce two bills today that would reorganize the F.D.A. and require drug makers to disclose the results of all clinical trials involving humans. The bills' co-author, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, has called the agency far too ''cozy'' with drug makers.
 In many cases, the date that the agency will begin the efforts announced yesterday is uncertain. For instance, Dr. Steven Galson, director of the agency's drug center, said at the news conference that the pilot program to assess systematically a drug's safety 18 months after its introduction would probably take about a year to put into place -- with the assessment due 18 months after that. 
 ''We're just organizing that process to get started,'' Dr. Galson said.
 In a scathing assessment released in September, the Institute of Medicine concluded that the F.D.A. was rife with internal squabbles and hobbled by underfinancing, poor management and outdated regulations. The institute, the most important medical advisory organization in the country, suggested that the agency undergo 25 major changes, many of which would require Congressional authorization.
 Alta Charo, a professor of law and bioethics at the University of Wisconsin and one of the authors of the Institute of Medicine's report, described the F.D.A. announcement yesterday as ''a good set of first steps towards improving the safety of the drug supply in the United States.''
 Professor Charo said she was ''disappointed'' that the agency had failed to adopt some of the institute's bolder recommendations, including one suggesting that the agency give greater authority to officials who assess the safety of drugs after they go on the market. 
 ''We viewed that as critical,'' she said.
 Alan Goldhammer, deputy vice president for regulatory affairs for the Pharmaceutical and Research Manufacturers of America, praised the F.D.A.'s announcement as a ''very thoughtful and comprehensive response'' to the Institute of Medicine's report.
 ''The agency has made substantive and significant progress in improving and enhancing the drug safety system in the U.S.'' said Mr. Goldhammer, whose organization represents drug makers.
 Still, the plan does little to address a problem that nearly all agree underlies many of its woes: a chronic shortage of government money. As Dr. von Eschenbach noted at the news conference, the agency has regulatory authority over about a quarter of the American economy. After the Sept. 11 attacks, the agency was asked to increase its efforts to prevent bioterrorism. Despite having greater responsibilities, its budget has remained relatively flat for years.
 There are now thousands of drugs in routine use. Figuring out which of these medicines may have undiscovered side effects will take a lot of money. The agency gets about $400 million of its $1.9 billion budget from fees assessed on drug makers. Under a formula negotiated with the drug industry, this money comes with strings attached. One restriction was that the F.D.A. could use little of the money to track the safety of approved drugs.
 That deal between the F.D.A. and drug makers expires this year, and the drug companies have agreed to allow more of their money to be used for postmarket safety assessments. Whether those fees are enough, whether there should be any strings attached to them and whether that money should be coming from drug makers at all has become the subject of fierce debate.
 ''Drug makers clearly get their money's worth with all this money,'' said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, director of Public Citizen's health research group. Dr. Wolfe and other consumer advocates say that the F.D.A.'s dependence on drug industry fees has softened its oversight. 
 Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who last week left his job as the F.D.A. deputy commissioner to return to the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market research group, said the real debate unfolding around the agency is between those who believe that it needs more money and tools to assess drug risks, and those who believe that the agency should begin regulating the practice of medicine. 
 ''I think we need to give the agency the resources it needs to get information about drug risks quickly,'' Dr. Gottlieb said. ''But we don't need the government telling doctors and patients what to do.''
 The F.D.A. plan promises to return the agency to its scientific roots. It once had robust laboratories that conducted original studies to assess drug risks on its own. Those laboratories were largely eliminated in the past decade to apply more money to the drug-approval process and the support of a bare-bones computer program to track side effects of drugs.
 But in the past two years, the agency has begun an effort to improve the science of drug safety, making itself an active participant in scientific endeavors once left exclusively to drug makers and basic scientists. 
 The efforts announced yesterday included the creation of a database of genetic codes associated with bad drug outcomes, the development of a computer model to identify patients who are most likely to suffer liver injury, and the design of screening tests that would identify patients most at risk of general drug problems.

HEADLINE: Bush Promotes His Free Trade Initiatives

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: EAST PEORIA, Ill., Jan. 30 

 BODY:
With Democrats making the case that his economic policies have benefited the rich more than the middle class, President Bush struck back on Tuesday, in the first of back-to-back speeches promoting what the White House characterizes as 41 consecutive months of economic growth.
 Mr. Bush came here to East Peoria, home to Caterpillar, the world's biggest manufacturer of earth-moving equipment, to advance his free trade initiatives and press Democrats to make his tax cuts permanent. On Wednesday, he heads to New York's financial district to deliver a more formal ''State of the Economy'' address at Federal Hall, where he is expected to ask Congress to extend his authority to negotiate trade agreements that cannot be amended. 
''The temptation is to say, well, trade may not be worth it, let's isolate ourselves, let's protect ourselves,'' Mr. Bush told a friendly audience of Caterpillar employees, standing against a backdrop of gigantic tractors in the company's familiar colors of yellow and black.
 He added, ''It's a bad mistake for the country to lose our confidence and not compete.''
 The president was mostly preaching to the converted. Caterpillar was carefully chosen by the White House to put Mr. Bush's policies in the best possible light. The company's exports to Chile and Australia have shot up following free trade agreements negotiated by the Bush administration. And China, which negotiated a trade deal with President Bill Clinton, is now Caterpillar's fifth-largest export market.
 ''Americans wonder, can you compete in a global economy?'' Mr. Bush said, before answering himself. ''My answer is, darn right, you can.''
 With Mr. Bush's public approval ratings having crumbled, his domestic agenda faltering and his Iraq strategy running into a wall of opposition on Capitol Hill, White House advisers are hoping to capitalize on economic growth and low unemployment figures as a way to elevate public opinion of the president.
 Already, the polls show a fresh hint of optimism. A survey by the Pew Research Center found that while public approval of Mr. Bush's handling of the war had dropped nine points, to 23 percent from 32 percent, from August to December 2006, approval of his handling of the economy went up six points, to 39 percent from 33 percent. A recent Gallup Poll, meanwhile, found 65 percent of respondents predicted they would be better off a year from now than they were today.
 But Democrats, who won control of Congress in part by arguing that Mr. Bush's economic policies are giving short shrift to the middle class, do not intend to give up that ground without a fight. The president's twin appearances this week are setting the stage for a battle between Mr. Bush and Congressional Democrats over the economy in general and trade in particular. 
 Already, Democrats are signaling they will resist extending the president's ''fast track'' trade negotiating authority, unless Mr. Bush couples the plan with proposals to demand tougher labor and environmental standards from the United States' trading partners and help for American workers who are displaced by foreign competition.
 ''We don't want to abandon free trade,'' Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said in an interview Tuesday, ''but he's got to offer more protections and cushions for people who are caught in its maw through no fault of their own.''
 On Wednesday, while Mr. Bush is delivering his speech in Manhattan, a House-Senate committee will hold a hearing on the economy, led by Mr. Schumer, who has just published a book outlining how Democrats can hold power by reclaiming their status as the party of the middle class. The chief Democratic witnesses are Robert E. Rubin and Lawrence H. Summers, both former treasury secretaries under President Bill Clinton.
 ''When the average middle class voter hears the president speak, he or she thinks, 'The guy doesn't know what I'm going through, it's not terrible, but it's not so rosy either,' '' Mr. Schumer said, adding that the hearing is ''intended to be an answer to the president.''
 In East Peoria on Tuesday, there was a preview of this same political clash. At Caterpillar, with Representative Ray LaHood, a Republican, in tow, Mr. Bush found what a pool report described as his ''inner boy'' when he drove one of the giant tractors for about 20 feet.
 ''I would suggest moving back,'' Mr. Bush announced as he climbed into the tractor cab. ''I'm about to crank this sucker up.'' And then he did, later pronouncing it ''a cool experience.''
 While the president was busy driving, the freshman Democrat who represents the district next door was busy issuing a press release arguing that Mr. Bush was ignoring the financial condition of his constituents. The congressman, Representative Phil Hare, who worked as an aide to his predecessor before winning election in November, pointed to another Illinois community, Galesburg, where he said free trade treaties ''drove 1,600 good-paying Maytag jobs'' to Sonora, Mexico.

HEADLINE: Shares Up Moderately as Markets Await a Rate Decision

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Stocks finished moderately higher in an uneven session yesterday as optimism about the economy helped investors overcome some of their apprehension about the Federal Reserve's impending decision on interest rates.
 The energy sector rose on a 5 percent spike in oil prices, while word that the billionaire investor Carl C. Icahn was seeking to join Motorola's board lifted technology stocks.
But fluctuations in the major indexes reflected the market's uncertainty as it waits for the Fed to complete a two-day meeting this afternoon. 
 Now that many investors have abandoned their hopes for a rate cut soon, many are regarding this year's positive economic reports and the Fed's holding pattern as auspicious for stocks.
 ''If the Fed feels the economy is strong enough on its own, it means corporate earnings this year will probably be better than people were expecting,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, chief market strategist at A. G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis.
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 32.53, to 12,523.31.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 8.20, at 1,428.82, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 7.55, to 2,448.64. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 4.87, or 0.61 percent, at 797.97. As oil prices shot higher, stock investors brushed off worries about fuel costs crimping consumers' discretionary spending and instead focused on a possible swell in oil companies' profits.
 In response to energy prices, Exxon Mobil rose $1.19, to $74.39; Chevron rose $1.54, to $73.07; and ConocoPhillips rose $1.03, to $65.65.
 Motorola, the cellphone maker, rose $1.27, to $19.58, after Mr. Icahn revealed his stake in the company and expressed interest in joining the board.
 The drug maker Merck fell 60 cents, to $44.91, after the company posted a 58 percent decline in quarterly profit, hurt by revamping charges and increased legal reserves linked to the withdraw of the painkiller Vioxx.
 The 3M Company, which makes products such as Post-it notes and Scotch tape, said profit jumped 58 percent on a large gain on the sale of its pharmaceutical business. But after stripping out that gain, the company -- often considered a barometer of American business health -- missed Wall Street expectations. Its shares fell $4.26, or 5.4 percent, to $74.70.
 Mr. Goldman said the Dow would have been about 30 points higher if not for 3M's disappointing results. Over all, corporate earnings have been coming in fairly strong.
 ''Fourth-quarter earnings are running 10.5 percent ahead of last year. It's a good increase, but we've been spoiled,'' Mr. Goldman said, adding that investors grew accustomed last year to higher double-digit earnings, but that the average gain is about 7 percent.
 Hugh A. Johnson, chairman and chief investment officer of Johnson Illington Advisers, said that gains were held in check by concern about the statement that will accompany the Fed's decision today.
 ''It appears to me as though the economy is stronger than they expected, and many governors have stated concerns about inflation,'' Mr. Johnson said. If that is reflected in the Fed's statement, he said, it may be difficult for the stock market because a rate increase later in the year could curb consumer spending.
 The bond market edged lower yesterday as fixed-income investors also awaited the Fed's decision. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32, to 98 3/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the price, fell to 4.87 percent, from 4.89 percent.

HEADLINE: 3M Earnings Are Weaker Than Expected

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The diversified manufacturer 3M posted a weaker-than-expected quarterly profit yesterday and said global economic growth was slowing, setting off a 5.1 percent decline in its share price. 
 The company, which makes products like Scotch tape, Post-it notes, Thinsulate insulation and other items, also forecast a 2007 profit that was below expectations.
3M's chief executive, George Buckley, cited ''slightly moderating economic growth worldwide.'' He said 3M's earnings growth would be slow in the first quarter, pick up in the second quarter and accelerate in the second half of the year.
 3M executives cited the sluggish housing market in the United States as causing lower demand for products ranging from its optical films used in liquid-crystal-display televisions to roofing granules used in shingles for houses. The slowdown in roofing granules alone cost the company 5 cents a share in earnings over the second half of the year, Mr. Buckley said.
 3M's net income in the fourth quarter rose 58 percent, to $1.2 billion, or $1.57 a share, from $746 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier.
 Excluding a $354 million gain, largely from the sale of its drug business, it earned $1.10 a share, 4 cents below analysts' expectations.
 Sales rose 8.6 percent from last year, to $5.78 billion, slightly above Wall Street's expectations.
 3M, based in St. Paul, expects 2007 earnings of $5.20 to $5.45 a share, including a net gain for a reorganization of 60 to 70 cents a share.
 Excluding one-time items, it expects a profit of $4.60 to $4.75 a share. 3M shares fell $4.02, to $74.94 a share.

HEADLINE: You Want Innovation? Offer a Prize

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
Besides the fact that both are considered great movies, ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Silence of the Lambs'' don't have much in common. One is the story of a girl from Kansas who's transported to a magical land where animals dance and sing, and the other is about a serial killer who eats his victims. You wouldn't necessarily expect people to have similar reactions to the two movies. 
 But it turns out that, for whatever reason, they usually do. Those who love one tend to love the other, and those who think one is overrated generally think the other one is, too.
 This odd little fact comes from an enormous database of movie ratings collected by Netflix, the online movie rental store. On its Web site, customers can give any movie 1 to 5 stars, and the company then uses these ratings -- 1.6 billion of them -- to find connections like the one between ''Oz'' and ''Silence of the Lambs.'' 
 The system, called Cinematch, allows Netflix's Web site to bombard users with recommendations of movies they are likely to enjoy. Netflix executives hope Cinematch will give them a leg up as digital downloading allows dozens of other companies to sell movies over the Internet. 
 So on the Ides of March last year, Reed Hastings, the company's chief executive, and three other executives were meeting at their Silicon Valley headquarters to talk about making the system better. They had just finished discussing one failed effort -- a promising algorithm designed by a hotshot computer scientist from Stanford (since lured to Google) -- when Mr. Hastings threw out an idea.
 ''We should run a prize,'' he said, an open competition challenging people to come up with a better version of Cinematch.
 One of the other executives asked how much the company should offer, recalled James Bennett, the vice president who oversees Cinematch.
 ''A million dollars,'' Mr. Hastings said.
 With that, Netflix unwittingly started down the path of proving that today's economy doesn't have nearly enough prizes.
 BACK in the 1700s, prizes were a fairly common way to reward innovation. Most famously, the British Parliament offered the $:20,000 longitude prize to anyone who figured out how to pinpoint location on the open sea. Dava Sobel's best-selling 1995 book ''Longitude'' told the story of the competition that ensued, and Mr. Hastings mentioned the longitude prize as a model at that meeting back in March. 
 Eventually, though, prizes began to be replaced by grants that awarded money upfront. Some of this was for good reason. As science became more advanced, scientists often needed to buy expensive equipment and hire a staff before having any chance of making a discovery.
 But grants also became popular for a less worthy reason: they made life easier for the government bureaucrats who oversaw them and for the scientists who received them. Robin Hanson, an economist at George Mason University who has studied the history of prizes, points out that they create a lot of uncertainty -- about who will receive money and when a government will have to pay it. Grants, on the other hand, allow a patron (and the scientists advising that patron) to choose who gets the money. ''Bureaucracies like a steady flow of money, not uncertainty,'' said Mr. Hanson, who worked as a physicist at NASA before becoming an economist. ''But prizes are often more effective if what you want is scientific progress.''
 In fact, when Netflix announced its prize in October, Mr. Hastings said he didn't necessarily expect contestants to make a lot of quick progress. Computer scientists say that Cinematch, along with Amazon's recommendation system, was already one of the most sophisticated. ''We thought we built the best darn thing ever,'' Mr. Hastings said.
 But Mr. Hastings underestimated the power of an open competition. Within days, many of the top people in a field known as machine learning were downloading the 100 million movie ratings Netflix had made public. The experts have since been locked in a Darwinian competition to build a better Cinematch, with the latest results posted on a leader board at Netflix's Web site. 
 Last week, I called Geoffrey Hinton, a professor of computer science at the University of Toronto whose team had been in first place when I last checked. But by the time I reached him, his team had been bumped down to second by a Hungarian team.
 (The contestants have also turned up some good trivia about movie preferences. Benji Smith of Salt Lake City deserves credit for the ''Oz''-''Lambs'' connection.) 
 To claim the million-dollar prize, a team has to build a system that is at least 10 percent better than Cinematch at predicting how many stars someone would give a movie. There are a small number of people, for instance, who love ''The Wizard of Oz'' but can't stomach ''Silence of the Lambs.'' Perhaps it is possible to identify them based on their attitude toward an eclectic group of other movies -- but only an advanced algorithm can find this pattern. 
 With four and a half years to go in the contest, the Hungarians' model is already 6.75 percent better than Cinematch. And Netflix hasn't had to pay for their time. In effect, the company ''has recruited a large fraction of the machine learning community for almost no money,'' as Mr. Hinton, the Toronto professor, put it. 
 These are the two essential advantages of prizes. They pay for nothing but performance, and they ensure that anyone with a good idea -- not just the usual experts -- can take a crack at a tough problem. Much to the horror of the leading astronomers of the day, a clockmaker ultimately claimed the longitude prize.
 Grants are still crucial. (Someone has to be paying those computer scientists while they're trying to win the Netflix prize.) But it seems pretty clear that our research system doesn't pay for results often enough. 
 Just look at how both political parties have so far tried to deal with global warming. They have handed out grants and subsidies for various alternative energy sources like ethanol, even though nobody knows what the best sources will ultimately be. A much smarter approach would be to mandate that the economy use less carbon. This would effectively set up a multibillion-dollar prize -- in the form of new customers -- for whichever companies came up with efficient energy sources.
 The good news is that the Netflix prize is one of a handful of recent high-profile prizes. One of the others is the X Prize, which was created in 1996 as a $10 million purse for the first private manned flight to the cusp of space. It was awarded just eight years later, showing once again that prize money has a way of focusing the mind.

HEADLINE: Big Investors Breathing New Life Into Gasping Auto Parts Suppliers

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 30 

 BODY:
These are dire times for Detroit's automakers, and even bleaker ones for thousands of largely invisible companies that make steering wheels, transmissions and other components for the vehicles that roll off the assembly lines. 
 Yet, as much as parts suppliers have struggled to turn a profit -- or in many cases, merely to stay in business -- investors clearly see tremendous opportunities in these companies.
In the last few months, private equity firms have been pouring billions of dollars into destitute suppliers with visions of rebuilding them back into the lucrative enterprises they once were.
 Analysts say the troubled suppliers have become attractive investments because they can be bought cheaply, demand for parts is growing as vehicle sales increase globally and low interest rates are making capital widely available for high-risk deals. 
 ''Just because these companies have run out of money doesn't mean there isn't value in their operations,'' said John Casesa, the managing partner and an automotive analyst for Casesa Strategic Advisers in New York. ''The problem is they just ran out of money doing business the old way.''
 Most notably, an investor group led by Appaloosa Management and Cerberus Capital Management is offering to invest $3.4 billion in the Delphi Corporation, the nation's biggest parts supplier, to help bring it out of bankruptcy. 
 Delphi chose the bid over a competing one worth $4.7 billion from Highland Capital. However, resistance from the United Automobile Workers union to Delphi's proposed wage cuts could derail the deal; Bloomberg News reports that Cerberus, which has not commented publicly, is threatening to withdraw its offer.
 Meanwhile, another billionaire investor, Carl C. Icahn, recently spent $200 million to take a 13 percent stake in the Lear Corporation, a parts supplier based in Southfield, Mich. 
 It is Lear's second time dealing with a big-name financier, the first being Wilbur L. Ross, who has made billions by resurrecting companies in steel and coal. He lately has added European suppliers to a portfolio he began building in 2005; he signed the deal to take control of Lear's unprofitable automotive interiors division in 2006. 
 Mr. Ross said the companies and facilities he had bought were fundamentally sound but became unprofitable only because they did not have the money to adapt as the industry became more competitive globally. And he can spend whatever is necessary to consolidate operations in regions with excess capacity and expand into high-growth markets such as China and Japan. 
 ''We're taking on what is perceived to be a tremendous amount of risk,'' Mr. Ross said, ''but we believe the actual risk is much less because we're doing it without debt.'' 
 Many of the suppliers Mr. Ross has acquired have relied on one Detroit automaker for a large percentage of their revenue. As a result, the companies were devastated as United States sales fell and orders for parts dwindled.
 ''It isn't that there aren't a lot of cars being sold,'' he said. ''The problem is that if you're only supplying a limited number of companies, and the ones you're supplying happen to be losing market share, then you're in a deep depression.''
 Mr. Ross said he was considering buying more parts suppliers. He declined to name potential targets but said he had confidentiality agreements with 10 companies. ''We're looking at everything that's in difficulty,'' he said.
 The few successful suppliers operating today scarcely resemble those once at the forefront of the industry. They focus heavily on innovation. Rather than simply churning out the same parts produced by their competitors, they have lengthy rosters of customers and do not depend on just one or two automakers. 
 ''There's nothing but opportunity,'' said Neil De Koker, president of the trade group Original Equipment Suppliers Association. ''But you can't sit in Detroit and wait for it to come to you.''
 That is because business has evaporated in Detroit and expanded in the rest of the world. General Motors and Ford Motor are greatly reducing the number of suppliers they use in the United States as they cut production to compensate for lower market share.
 Within a few years, analysts expect Ford to buy parts from 700 to 800 suppliers, down from the 2,500 it has worked with in the past. For example, Ford is halving the number of companies supplying it with major components like seats, instrument panels and wiring.
 ''We have too many. There has to be fewer,'' Ford's senior vice president for global purchasing, Thomas K. Brown, said this month at the Automotive News World Congress in Dearborn, Mich. 
 G.M. has not indicated how many suppliers it plans to use in the future, but in the last year it ended agreements with about 500 of the 3,700 companies providing parts. Toyota and Honda, by comparison, each use about 600 suppliers in North America.
 In turn, the biggest parts companies, known as Tier 1 suppliers, are buying fewer components from small parts makers. 
 The cutbacks mean many suppliers will lose much, if not all, of their business in Detroit.
 ''We're in a shakeout right now, make no mistake about it,'' Richard E. Dauch, chairman of American Axle and Manufacturing, said. ''You must have the mindset to do twice as much, twice as fast -- and if you don't, leave.''
 Many suppliers have already exited the industry, and more are expected to do so in the months ahead. Mr. Brown, the senior vice president at Ford, said he expected a wave of supplier bankruptcies in February. In the last year, the number of distressed suppliers doing business with Ford increased 44 percent, he said.
 Analysts see little on the horizon to help suppliers that do not sharply alter their way of doing business.
 ''The mood is a little more upbeat, but only because supplier executives have become used to this environment -- rather than it's actually improving,'' said Brian Johnson of Lehman Brothers in New York.
 Mr. Dauch, who bought five troubled G.M. plants in 1994 to create American Axle, said that automakers were having little difficulty outside North America.
 ''Let's stop saying the automotive industry is in trouble -- it's not,'' Mr. Dauch said. ''You have to go where the business is.''
 TRW Automotive, which makes safety products such as airbags and stability control systems, has done exactly that. The company, based in suburban Livonia, Mich., now sells more parts in Europe than the United States, a reversal of a few years ago.
 Just as suppliers have broadened their customer base as a hedge against sales slowdowns at one or two carmakers, John C. Plant, TRW's chief executive, said, ''We don't want to be overly dependent on any one region.'' 
 Suppliers that failed to diversify quickly enough are the ones now operating in bankruptcy and being sought by investors eager to force such changes. As more suppliers run out of money, private equity firms are lining up for their chance to prove that it is possible to earn a profit even in an overwhelmingly unprofitable industry.
 ''Even though Detroit is going through a terrible crisis,'' said Mr. Casesa, the analyst, ''thank goodness it is happening when there is plenty of capital available to restructure these companies.''

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption in Business Day yesterday with the Market Place column, about private equity firms investing in suppliers of automotive parts, misstated the involvement of one financier, Wilbur L. Ross, in the Lear Corporation. Although Mr. Ross bought Lear's unprofitable automotive interiors division in 2006, he does not hold any shares in Lear itself and does not control the company.
