HEADLINE: Benefits, With Strings

BYLINE: By VICTOR FLEISCHER

 BODY:
Large multinationals based in the United States -- among them General Electric, Pfizer, Apple and Citigroup -- have been hoarding record amounts of cash overseas, mainly because of the 35 percent tax they would have to pay if they brought it back to the United States.
The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 offered a temporary tax holiday that allowed firms to repatriate cash at about a 5 percent tax rate, but there were strings attached. The repatriated money was to be used only on permissible activities like research and development, capital expenditures and pension funding. It was not to be used for shareholder dividends or share repurchases. 
The purported goal of the legislation was to create jobs, not simply to enrich shareholders at the expense of federal tax revenue. In recent years, companies have lobbied for another tax holiday.
Tax policy experts are suspicious of tax holidays, and most experts question the effectiveness of attaching strings to such legislation. Because cash is fungible, companies might be expected to use the repatriated money for permitted domestic activities that they would have conducted anyway, freeing up other cash to be used for dividends and stock buybacks. If companies merely reshuffle the use of cash without changing behavior, then the tax holiday amounts to a windfall to shareholders, not an effective economic stimulus.
The 2004 tax holiday brought back $312 billion in extraordinary cash dividends from foreign subsidiaries. How much of that cash was used for permitted activities, and how much for impermissible dividends and stock buybacks? A 2011 paper by Dhammika Dharmapala, C. Fritz Foley and Kristen J. Forbes, published in The Journal of Finance, estimated that 60 cents to 92 cents of every repatriated dollar was spent on shareholder payouts in 2005. The paper is Exhibit A in the case against future tax holidays.
A new paper by Thomas J. Brennan of the Northwestern University School of Law challenges that study and finds that, for the 20 companies that repatriated the most cash, 78 cents of every dollar was spent on permissible uses, and just 22 cents on impermissible shareholder payouts. Extending the analysis to 341 companies outside the top 20, Mr. Brennan estimates that about 40 cents of every dollar was spent on impermissible shareholder payouts, still much lower than the earlier estimate.
Mr. Brennan attributes the different findings to a change in research methodology. The Dharmapala paper uses econometric techniques to estimate the marginal increase in repatriation caused by the legislation, focusing on a certain subgroup expected to benefit from the legislation -- namely companies that face a low tax rate abroad and have a subsidiary in a tax haven. The Brennan study also uses statistical estimates, but it constrains those estimates with actual publicly available data on what each individual company spent on various activities. Using the data on actual share buybacks and dividends, Mr. Brennan shows that the Dharmapala estimate is too high.
The Brennan study is important for its explanation of how companies responded to the 2004 tax holiday. But it hardly endorses tax holidays as an instrument of international tax policy. Indeed, Mr. Brennan notes that, in a separate paper, he has made the case against temporary tax holidays.
It is important to remember the big picture: there is no evidence that the 2004 tax holiday created any jobs.
Mr. Brennan does not attempt to provide such evidence. Nor does he argue that spending on domestic activities is necessarily more effective in creating economic stimulus than dividends or stock buybacks would have been. After all, a shareholder who receives a dividend from Company A might reinvest the cash in Company B, an action that seems just as likely to create a new job as would spending by Company A.
Moreover, the Brennan study still finds significant amounts of shareholder payouts from repatriated profits, ranging from 20 cents on the dollar for the largest companies to 40 cents for smaller ones. It is sad, and unfortunate, that our expectations of corporate managers have fallen so far that 20 to 40 percent noncompliance might be viewed as a success.
The fact that the managers only incompletely evaded the purpose of the legislation should not be read as an endorsement of tax holidays.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bailout Fraud

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
In November 2008, during the depths of the financial crisis, Darryl Layne Woods, a bank executive in Missouri, applied to the United States Treasury for bailout money. His bank received $1 million. 
Just days later, Mr. Woods used $381,000 of that money to buy a waterfront condominium in Fort Myers, Fla.
On Tuesday, Mr. Woods, the former chairman of Mainstreet Bank in Ashland, Mo., pleaded guilty to criminal charges in Federal District Court in Jefferson City, Mo.
''At a time when many other Americans were losing their homes, he was siphoning off public funds to buy a luxury vacation condo in Florida,'' said Tammy Dickinson, the United States attorney for the Western District of Missouri.
The investigation was led by the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or Sigtarp. The office, now headed by Christy Romero, has policed the use of the bailout money since the fund was established, and has been responsible for criminal cases filed against more than 140 individuals.
Prosecutors also accused Mr. Woods of covering up the scheme. In February 2009, a week after buying the Florida condominium, he sent a letter to Neil Barofsky, then the head of Sigtarp, in response to a request for more information regarding how Mainstreet used the bailout money it received.
Mr. Woods made no mention of his real estate purchase in the three-page letter to Mr. Barofsky.
''We are a small central Missouri community bank and while I would like to be able to provide you with very specific and quantitative responses we are currently operating under the assumption that the worst scenario could occur and the TARP proceeds will provide vitally needed infusions to a bleeding patient,'' Mr. Woods wrote.
Under the terms of his plea agreement, Mr. Woods must desist from any further involvement in banking. Under federal law, he is subject to a sentence of up to a year in prison. His lawyer, James R. Hobbs, did not immediately return a request for comment.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Rose in June, And Confidence Is Climbing

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A pair of reports issued Tuesday offered bright news on the state of the economy, with home prices increasing and consumer confidence rising.
Home prices rose 12.1 percent in June compared with a year earlier, nearly matching a seven-year high. However, month-over-month price gains slowed in most markets, a sign that higher mortgage rates may cool the housing recovery. 
The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller 20-city home price index slowed only marginally from May's year-over-year gain of 12.2 percent, the fastest since March 2006. And all 20 cities posted gains from the previous month and compared with a year ago, according to the report.
In addition, Americans' confidence in the economy inched closer to a five-and-a-half-year high on growing optimism that hiring and wages could pick up in coming months.
The Conference Board, a private research group based in New York, said Tuesday that its consumer confidence index rose to 81.5 in August. That is up from a revised reading of 81 in July and just below the 82.1 reading in June, which was the highest since January 2008.
In the housing report, prices in Las Vegas soared 24.9 percent from a year earlier to lead all cities. Purchases by investors have helped drive that increase.
Other cities hit hard by the housing downturn also posted major gains in the last year. Prices have jumped 24.5 percent in San Francisco and nearly 20 percent in both Los Angeles and Phoenix.
Still, 14 of the 20 cities posted smaller gains in June compared with May. That is unusual, as June is the middle of the crucial summer buying season.
And in cities less affected by the housing crisis, gains have been more modest. Prices in New York and Cleveland are about 3 percent higher than a year earlier. Prices rose 5.7 percent in Washington and 6.7 percent in Boston.
In the Conference Board report, consumers' income expectations, which fell earlier this year after a January payroll tax increase, rebounded to the highest level in two-and-a-half years, said Lynn Franco, director of the board's economic indicators.
Although consumers were more confident about the future, their assessment of the current economy dipped slightly in August.
''Consumer sentiment is holding steady, supported by advances in stocks, solid job creation, and a broad-based recovery in the housing market,'' Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, wrote in a note.
Consumers' confidence in the economy is watched closely because their spending accounts for about 70 percent of national economic activity.
After hitting bottom at 25.3 at the depths of the Great Recession in February 2009, the index has bounced back. But it has yet to get back to the 90 reading that signals a healthy economy.
Americans' confidence jumped in June on hopes that the job market was starting to turn around. The economy has created an average of 192,000 jobs a month this year, slightly ahead of last year's pace. And the unemployment rate fell last month to a four-and-a-half-year low of 7.4 percent.

HEADLINE: French Court Lifts an Environmental Ban on Mercedes-Benz Sales

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY; James Kanter contributed reporting from Brussels.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Daimler, the German maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, may resume sales in France after the country's highest administrative court temporarily lifted a ban on Tuesday.
Sales had been suspended since July because the cars do not use an air-conditioner refrigerant intended to be more environmentally friendly, but which Daimler says is unsafe. While nominally an environmental issue, the matter has taken on the overtones of a trade dispute, risking tensions between German regulators and European Union officials.
Daimler sought the court's intervention after the French environment ministry announced that it would not allow the registration of certain Mercedes-Benz models that did not use a refrigerant that conformed with European Union law. The ministry argued that by refusing to follow the law, Daimler was harming efforts to reduce global warming and was distorting competition in the auto market. 
But the court, the Council of State, rejected the ministry's arguments, at least temporarily, and gave the government two days to begin providing the registration numbers Daimler needs to resume sales.
Considering the small number of cars in question -- several thousand by Daimler's estimate -- the court said there was no serious danger to the environment. Christoph Horn, a Daimler spokesman, said the sale of 4,600 to 5,000 cars had been blocked by the ministry's move.
The court also said that it had ''serious doubts'' about the legal reasoning the ministry had used to justify its decision. A previous attempt by the ministry to stop sales of the cars was overturned by a lower court in July.
Daimler, in a statement from its headquarters in Stuttgart, said that it was ''delighted'' with the opinion and that it expected ''the French authorities to start registering our vehicles within the next 48 hours.''
The case is being closely watched by global automakers. Regulators in the United States and other countries are also seeking ways to reduce emissions of the refrigerants in air-conditioners and other such gases thought to contribute to global warming. Carmakers have economic incentives to standardize the refrigerants they use, rather than have to conform to multiple local standards. The new refrigerant, R1234yf, a Honeywell-DuPont product, is also being evaluated by the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States for possible use.
Under a European Union law that became fully applicable at the start of this year, the older refrigerant, R134a, is banned in all new-model vehicles. The law does not specify a replacement refrigerant. But the law does require any replacements to meet certain criteria, among them that new refrigerants have an impact on global warming no more than 150 times that of carbon dioxide.
Air-conditioning gases are considered major contributors to global warming. R134a, which is still being used by Daimler, is 1,400 times more damaging to the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, according to the E.P.A.
By comparison, R1234yf, favored by most global automakers, is only four times worse than carbon dioxide. Using it across Europe would be equivalent to removing four million cars from the roads, the manufacturers say.
Honeywell said in a statement Tuesday that it was ''unfortunate that Daimler's decision to not comply'' with the European rule ''has taken up the court's time, roiled the industry, and led to bureaucratic gamesmanship that is bad for the environment.''
Daimler defends its actions and notes that German regulators approved its continued use of the older refrigerant after its tests showed that R1234yf was unsafe. Both Daimler and Volkswagen, which has also said it will not use the new refrigerant, say they intend to concentrate their efforts on developing carbon-dioxide-based air-conditioning systems.
The European Commission, the European Union's executive arm, began examining the legality of the German actions in June and the French response a few weeks later. Michael Jennings, a spokesman for the commission, said Tuesday that the inquiry was continuing and could still take several weeks to conclude.
''We have taken note of the preliminary ruling today,'' Mr. Jennings said. ''While we will look at it closely, it does not have a direct bearing on our ongoing deliberations in relation to this issue.''
The commission is examining why the German authorities are allowing Daimler to ignore European Union law, throwing a wrench into the union's plan to phase out the environmentally damaging refrigerant. If Antonio Tajani, the European Union commissioner for industry, eventually finds the German authorities at fault, he could recommend suing them at the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to change their stance or modify their procedures.
The French court will now deliberate over a final ruling in the case, while officials at the European Commission in Brussels conduct their own independent review of all the testing done so far on the product.
Germany's Federal Motor Transport Authority, or KBA, said this month that its discussions of the question with carmakers ''resulted in a very uneven picture regarding their risk assessment'' and concluded that ''a neutral risk assessment by the KBA was impossible.''
The regulatory uncertainty is already taking its toll. Responding to fears generated by the Daimler test, Toyota Motor said last week that it would return to the old refrigerant, though it said it remained ''very confident'' about the new product. Unlike Daimler, Toyota is free to make the change, since the models that it had switched were not required to use the new refrigerant this year.

HEADLINE: John J. Gilligan, 1970s Governor of Ohio, Dies at 92

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Former Gov. John J. Gilligan of Ohio, a liberal Democrat whose creation of the state income tax was his most lasting accomplishment and also the undoing of his political career, died on Monday at his home in Cincinnati. He was 92. 
His death was confirmed by his caregiver, Frank Kennedy, who did not provide a cause.
Mr. Gilligan's daughter Kathleen Sebelius, a former governor of Kansas, is the federal secretary of health and human services.
Mr. Gilligan, a teacher and former congressman, was elected governor in 1970. He inherited a school financing crisis in which 24 districts had closed for lack of money and more were expected to follow suit.
Governor Gilligan persuaded legislators to enact the state's first corporate and personal income tax in 1971 to deal with the problem. He also presided over the creation of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
As he headed into his campaign for a second term, he claimed a 57 percent increase in state financing for primary and secondary education, a 60 percent increase for mental health and spending increases to address drug abuse.
But the income tax continued to work against him, and he lost his re-election bid to James A. Rhodes, a Republican and former two-term governor, by 11,000 votes out of 2.9 million cast.
John Joyce Gilligan was born on March 22, 1921, in Cincinnati and graduated from the University of Notre Dame. He served as a Navy gunnery officer in World War II. After the war, he earned a master's degree at the University of Cincinnati and taught literature at Xavier University in Cincinnati.
Mr. Gilligan was elected to the House of Representatives in 1964 but lost his re-election race two years later.
After leaving the Governor's Mansion, Mr. Gilligan led the United States Agency for International Development for two years.
He returned to teaching, spending 12 years at Notre Dame, where he also led the university's Institute for International Peace Studies. In 1992, he returned to the University of Cincinnati, where he was the director of the College of Law's Civic Forum.
Besides Ms. Sebelius, survivors include his wife, the former Susan Fremont; another daughter, Ellen Gilligan; and two sons, Donald and John.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Formula for Syria

 BODY:
As a French national who lived in the United States for nearly two decades and who came to admire Americans for their fair outlook regarding other nations, I find Edward N. Luttwak's article ''Keep Syria in a stalemate'' (Views, Aug. 24) disheartening. The Machiavellian ideas he seems to advocate for the West of switching alliances in Syria between Bashar al-Assad's forces and the rebels every time one side overpowers the other do not coincide with what made America so great. These ideas are more like those that abounded in Europe in the past two centuries, when powers played one against the other until they got us into the political and economic difficulties we face today. 
Isabelle le Millour, Saumur, France
A stark reason to work with Russia
In ''The drive to blame Russia'' (Views, Aug. 22), Thomas Graham cites the costs to the breakdown in the U.S.-Russia relationship. But he misses one of the most important shared challenges: combating nuclear terrorism. The nuclear-materials black market is alive and well, and there are enough nuclear materials poorly secured worldwide to make thousands of bombs. President Obama's responsibility is to look past our distaste for President Vladimir Putin and work with him to lock down nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands. A recent Harvard study documented the success of partnering on nuclear issues: The United States, Russia and Kazakhstan successfully locked down enough Soviet-era nuclear materials for dozens of bombs. A chill in relations should not freeze initiatives that benefit both U.S. and Russian national security interests.

1913 President Advises 'Waiting Policy'
WASHINGTON -- The deep interest which the country is manifesting in the Mexican crisis was reflected in the crowded galleries of the House of Representatives when, at one o'clock this afternoon [Aug. 27], the President appeared before Congress, which was assembled in joint session. President Wilson advocated a waiting policy. In the course of his Message he said: -- ''The peace, prosperity and contentment of Mexico mean much more than merely an enlarged field for our commerce and enterprise. They mean the enlargement of the field of self-government and the whole world desires her peace and progress. The present circumstances of the Republic do not seem to promise even the foundations of such a peace.'' 
1938 Eyston Sets New Speed Record
BONNEVILLE SALT FLATS, Utah -- A new world's land speed record was established on the flats here today [Aug. 27] by Captain G.E.T. Eyston, British racing driver, whose 3,600-horsepower Thunderbolt roared over the measured mile in 10.36 seconds at a speed of 347.49 miles an hour. In a second run, Captain Eyston covered the mile in 10.48 seconds, giving him a speed of 345.51 miles an hour. His new record bettered the previous record he established last November by 35 miles an hour. Wednesday, Captain Eyston sped over the course at an unofficial speed of 347.155 miles an hour, but was robbed of credit for a record because the electric timing traps failed to function.
1963 U.K. and France Progress on Channel
PARIS -- Britain and France edged a little bit out of their diplomatic estrangement today [Aug. 27] and a little closer toward realization of that century-old dream, a link across the English Channel. British Transport Minister Ernest Marples flew to Paris this morning for conference with his counterpart in the French government, Marc Jacquot. After a morning conference and a luncheon, the two men issued a joint communiqué which announced that they had agreed to publish a Franco-British governmental study on the project in mid-September. A governmental committee has been working for more than a year on questions of financing a project, and the political and economic problems involved.

HEADLINE: Film Chronicles the Inner Workings of Berkeley

BYLINE: By NICOLAS RAPOLD

 BODY:
It has taken Frederick Wiseman 45 years to get from high school to college. The master filmmaker's latest portrait of an institution, ''At Berkeley,'' centers on the University of California in Berkeley and joins an extraordinary résumé that stretches back to ''High School'' in 1968 and his controversial debut, ''Titicut Follies,'' in 1967. In between, Mr. Wiseman has established himself as one of America's greatest chroniclers in any medium.
''What I'm interested in is making movies about as many different subjects as I can, and as many different forms of human experience,'' Mr. Wiseman, indefatigable at 83, said in a phone conversation during his summer break in Maine. 
His output seems to have matched his ambition. ''At Berkeley,'' his 40th feature, will have its world premiere on Sept. 2 at the Venice Film Festival. It joins a cinematic panorama of subjects whose understated titles belie their depth: ''Basic Training,'' ''Welfare,'' ''Meat'' (meatpacking plants), ''The Store,'' ''Boxing Gym,'' ''Ballet,'' ''Deaf'' (special-needs school), ''Belfast, Maine.'' The richly observed films are sprawling and intimate, dense with the raw material of human endeavor and discourse, and free from the ready-made storylines and messaging of mainstream documentary, much less voiceover.
In ''At Berkeley,'' we witness the autumn 2010 semester at a university in crisis, yet thriving. Mr. Wiseman uses the institution's settings -- the meetings, classes and protests -- as stages to play out its multifaceted drama of people and ideas. A student's tears at a financial aid session turn the moment into a portrait of middle-class America on the ropes. Budget meetings show the struggle to maintain the values of public education, and create a profile of a leader in then-Chancellor Robert Birgeneau. A goal is scored in a field hockey game. Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich in a lecture makes an example out of a valued former aide who was unafraid to criticize him. And -- this is Berkeley -- a reading room is occupied by the latest generation of student activists.
''I deliberately contacted Berkeley first,'' Mr. Wiseman said. ''For two reasons: It's public and it's a great university.''
Mr. Wiseman made his pitch in a letter to Mr. Birgenau, who promptly invited the filmmaker to visit. By the end of lunch together, the filmmaker had permission to shoot at will -- with the exception of tenure discussions -- and began production in the autumn of 2010. With the paid assistance of a former chief of staff for chancellors, John Cummins, Mr. Wiseman picked his way through the campus, amassing 250 hours of footage over 12 weeks of shooting.
While his recent films, ''Boxing Gym'' and ''Crazy Horse,'' are essentially confined to single-building locales, Mr. Wiseman and John Davey, his longtime cameraman, traversed a campus of 1,232-acres, or about 500 hectares, for ''At Berkeley.'' Its students, faculty, staff and local residents number in the tens of thousands, ''with all the problems of a small city,'' Mr. Wiseman said. Like any good navigator of gatekeepers, the filmmaker cultivated his sources.
''Secretaries or administrative assistants are always very important people for this kind of a movie, because they know what's going on,'' he said.
What was going included budget wrangling after a steady decline in state financing for the university: from 54 percent of the budget in 1987, to 12 percent in 2012, according to The Daily Californian, the campus newspaper. Mr. Wiseman said that wasn't why he made the documentary, but Berkeley ends up serving as a bellwether for the broader predicament of public institutions under economic pressures and anti-government politicking. While Mr. Birgeneau has been criticized for his handling of the budget, ''At Berkeley'' depicts a delicate balancing act with an eye toward preserving scholarships and teaching standards.
Mr. Wiseman -- wry, sharp, and unfailingly precise about what his films do and do not do -- is typically reluctant to generalize. But he spoke freely on the threat faced by public universities, and especially the humanities.
''There's a political agenda behind that, which is to dumb people down. Because if you don't study the humanities and you don't have technical education, you're not going to know about all the questions connected with the Enlightenment or free speech or representative government,'' Mr. Wiseman said, adding, as if to temper his comments: ''Blah blah blah.''
Intellectual and civic engagement are prominent themes in Mr. Wiseman's films. The meetings and class discussions of ''At Berkeley'' are the marketplace of ideas in action, just as his 2007 film ''State Legislature'' shows the mundane workings of state government.
In his scenes and sequences in ''At Berkeley'' and other films, Mr. Wiseman seeks to do justice to both ''the literal and the abstract,'' resulting in a lengthy, analytical editing process. Take, for example, the odd, even comical recurring sight of battle-ready camouflaged Reserve Officers' Training Corps students doing drills and lobbing fake grenades on campus. It's at once a reminder of the existence of these programs, of their financial value to campus coffers, of the reach of war even into the groves of the academe.
The classes on display, with their ceaseless talk of complex ideas, bring out one of the film's underlying themes.
''There's a question of how do you conceptualize with words, and how do you conceptualize with images,'' Mr. Wiseman said. The filmmaker said he struggled over whether to include one lecture about dark energy, which he could not make heads or tails of. (The lecturer: Nobel Prize winner Saul Perlmutter.) Ultimately, he saw a value in the experience of disorientation, recalling how he, in ''Deaf,'' did not subtitle sign language.
As expansive as Mr. Wiseman's film is, the average observer might still reasonably ask: where's the beer? That is to say, what about student life? We see students walking, lounging, playing field hockey, acting on stage, studying, discussing race, but dormitory life is not in evidence.
''One of the reasons I called the movie 'At Berkeley' as opposed to 'Berkeley' was to suggest that these were all events that took place at Berkeley but there was no suggestion that this was 'all' of Berkeley,'' Mr. Wiseman said. His wittiest take on the social scene comes within the film: a student musical number about Facebook.
Mr. Wiseman made a point, however, to highlight the campus's diversity. Its composition forecasts the future of the country at large, when whites will be a minority and he noted its makeup is far different from his own experience at Williams College, where he graduated in 1947.
''Williams, when I went there, was academically superb and wildly anti-Semitic,'' Mr. Wiseman recalls. ''As it turned out, the Jews and the Christian rejects were the most interesting people on campus. Nevertheless, when you're sent as a 17-year-old leaving home for the first time, it's hard to deal with.''
Mr. Wiseman spotlights what could be a mission statement for his larger project, in one student's stage performance of a monologue from ''Our Town'' about a time capsule. Even the ancient metropolis of Babylon, the young thespian recounts, left little to no record of day-to-day life.
Mr. Wiseman's next film is about the National Gallery in London, which he interrupted the production of ''At Berkeley'' to shoot, and it's still in the editing stage.''At Berkeley'' is tentatively to be released on Nov. 8 in the United States.

HEADLINE: A Moose in the Room

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
Even at this point in her career, Mollie Katzen still feels the need to be clearing up Moosewood myths.
For starters, she is not a vegetarian. Of course, the author of perhaps the best-selling vegetarian cookbook of all time is not a meat advocate, but if you ''put a few slices of steak on top of a salad'' she said, she will eat them.
She does not live in Ithaca, N.Y., the locale of the famous Moosewood Restaurant that she helped found as a member of the Moosewood Collective in the early 1970s and then made famous by naming her first book of recipes after it. She has lived in Berkeley, Calif., for more than two decades and is not the collective type at all. ''I am much more of a lone ranger,'' she said in a recent interview at the home of her agent in Brooklyn Heights. 
And despite selling roughly four million copies of her ''Moosewood Cookbook'' and having a PBS cooking show from 1995 to 2000, she says she is certainly not a celebrity chef.
''People know Moosewood,'' she said, ''but not Mollie.''
Ms. Katzen, 62, has definitely evolved; she has had two marriages, two divorces and two children. Her long brown locks, once held back by barrettes, are shorn and gray, and instead of using copious sour cream, she dresses her dishes up with fancy vinegars and roasted garlic.
But she has never left cooking. Since ''Moosewood,'' she has published 11 cookbooks and has a 12th coming out in September: ''The Heart of the Plate: Vegetarian Recipes for a New Generation'' (Houghton Mifflin). None have come close to matching the power of the first, which still sells 20,000 to 30,000 copies a year.
''People have an emotional attachment to it,'' she said. ''Forty years later, I am still grateful and not at all jaded about what happened with the 'Moosewood,' the fact that it is still around the third and fourth generation.''
But for all the gratitude, there is the odd fact that Ms. Katzen is one of those visionaries who have been rendered almost invisible because they succeeded in making the unheard-of commonplace. When the Moosewood Restaurant opened, America was a very different place.
''I grew up believing that vegetables were something that grew in my mother's freezer,'' she said of her otherwise idyllic childhood in Rochester.
At Moosewood, she said, the collective served only a few dishes each night because fresh produce was hard to find for so much of the year. ''Now people make a big deal of buying local, but back then, the farm five miles this way and two miles that way was all that we had.'' (She left the collective and the restaurant in 1978, amid some bitter accusations that she had appropriated group recipes as her own.)
Given her role in kicking off an age in which vegetables are not just garnishes for meat, one might expect Ms. Katzen to be delighted by the farm-to-table movement. But that is only half right: She loves farm markets, but is less keen about the food-worshiping culture that has risen with it.
''I personally do not like the word 'foodie,' because as human beings we are all innately drawn to food, so to make food a niche thing is wrong,'' she said. ''I don't even like the word 'chef.' I think they can take the food and sometimes themselves very seriously.'' Of many of the superstar chefs on TV, she said, ''I consider them to be entertainers and media personalities rather than cooks.''
Like the original ''Moosewood,'' her new book is all about accessibility, and includes her illustrations, though this time she has added her photographs as well.
Ms. Katzen said she has never taken a cooking class, but in the introduction she emphasizes how much she has grown as a cook.
''Since the 1970s, I've both expanded my repertoire and simplified my approach,'' she writes. ''My early recipes were packed with rich ingredients like butter, cheese, sour cream, eggs, in large part to appease those who might be worried that the lack of meat would leave everyone hungry.'' Now she has ''a better understanding of how to make food taste wonderful through seasoning, selective and various uses of heat, timing, attention to detail and a stronger sense of aesthetic economy.''
These days, her idea of a great dish is to cut fresh tomatoes and peaches, let the juices seep out, then use fresh bread to sop them up. ''In the old days I didn't pay attention to those juices,'' she said, ''and now that is the most exciting dish to me.''

HEADLINE: The Dream, the Speech and Its Lasting Power

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
It was late in the day and hot, and after a long march and an afternoon of speeches about federal legislation, unemployment and racial and social justice, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. finally stepped to the lectern, in front of the Lincoln Memorial, to address the crowd of 250,000 gathered on the National Mall.
He began slowly, with magisterial gravity, talking about what it was to be black in America in 1963 and the ''shameful condition'' of race relations a hundred years after the Emancipation Proclamation. Unlike many of the day's previous speakers, he did not talk about particular bills before Congress or the marchers' demands. Instead, he situated the civil rights movement within the broader landscape of history -- time past, present and future -- and within the timeless vistas of Scripture. 
Dr. King was about halfway through his prepared speech when Mahalia Jackson -- who earlier that day had delivered a stirring rendition of the spiritual ''I Been 'Buked and I Been Scorned'' -- shouted out to him from the speakers' stand: ''Tell 'em about the 'Dream,' Martin, tell 'em about the 'Dream'!'' She was referring to a riff he had delivered on earlier occasions, and Dr. King pushed the text of his remarks to the side and began an extraordinary improvisation on the dream theme that would become one of the most recognizable refrains in the world.
With his improvised riff, Dr. King took a leap into history, jumping from prose to poetry, from the podium to the pulpit. His voice arced into an emotional crescendo as he turned from a sobering assessment of current social injustices to a radiant vision of hope -- of what America could be. ''I have a dream,'' he declared, ''my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!''
Many in the crowd that afternoon, 50 years ago on Wednesday, had taken buses and trains from around the country. Many wore hats and their Sunday best -- ''People then,'' the civil rights leader John Lewis would recall, ''when they went out for a protest, they dressed up'' -- and the Red Cross was passing out ice cubes to help alleviate the sweltering August heat. But if people were tired after a long day, they were absolutely electrified by Dr. King. There was reverent silence when he began speaking, and when he started to talk about his dream, they called out, ''Amen,'' and, ''Preach, Dr. King, preach,'' offering, in the words of his adviser Clarence B. Jones, ''every version of the encouragements you would hear in a Baptist church multiplied by tens of thousands.''
You could feel ''the passion of the people flowing up to him,'' James Baldwin, a skeptic of that day's March on Washington, later wrote, and in that moment, ''it almost seemed that we stood on a height, and could see our inheritance; perhaps we could make the kingdom real.''
Dr. King's speech was not only the heart and emotional cornerstone of the March on Washington, but also a testament to the transformative powers of one man and the magic of his words. Fifty years later, it is a speech that can still move people to tears. Fifty years later, its most famous lines are recited by schoolchildren and sampled by musicians. Fifty years later, the four words ''I have a dream'' have become shorthand for Dr. King's commitment to freedom, social justice and nonviolence, inspiring activists from Tiananmen Square to Soweto, Eastern Europe to the West Bank.
Why does Dr. King's ''Dream'' speech exert such a potent hold on people around the world and across the generations? Part of its resonance resides in Dr. King's moral imagination. Part of it resides in his masterly oratory and gift for connecting with his audience -- be they on the Mall that day in the sun or watching the speech on television or, decades later, viewing it online. And part of it resides in his ability, developed over a lifetime, to convey the urgency of his arguments through language richly layered with biblical and historical meanings.
The son, grandson and great-grandson of Baptist ministers, Dr. King was comfortable with the black church's oral tradition, and he knew how to read his audience and react to it; he would often work jazzlike improvisations around favorite sermonic riffs -- like the ''dream'' sequence -- cutting and pasting his own words and those of others. At the same time, the sonorous cadences and ringing, metaphor-rich language of the King James Bible came instinctively to him. Quotations from the Bible, along with its vivid imagery, suffused his writings, and he used them to put the sufferings of African-Americans in the context of Scripture -- to give black audience members encouragement and hope, and white ones a visceral sense of identification.
In his ''Dream'' speech, Dr. King alludes to a famous passage from Galatians, when he speaks of ''that day when all of God's children -- black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics -- will be able to join hands.'' As he did in many of his sermons, he also drew parallels between ''the Negro'' still an ''exile in his own land'' and the plight of the Israelites in Exodus, who, with God on their side, found deliverance from hardship and oppression, escaping slavery in Egypt to journey toward the Promised Land.
The entire March on Washington speech reverberates with biblical rhythms and parallels, and bristles with a panoply of references to other historical and literary texts that would have resonated with his listeners. In addition to allusions to the prophets Isaiah (''I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low'') and Amos (''We will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream''), there are echoes of the Declaration of Independence (''the unalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness''); Shakespeare (''this sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent''); and popular songs like Woody Guthrie's ''This Land Is Your Land'' (''Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York,'' ''Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California'').
Such references added amplification and depth of field to the speech, much the way T. S. Eliot's myriad allusions in ''The Waste Land'' add layered meaning to that poem. Dr. King, who had a doctorate in theology and once contemplated a career in academia, was shaped by both his childhood in his father's church and his later studies of disparate thinkers like Reinhold Niebuhr, Gandhi and Hegel. Along the way, he developed a gift for synthesizing assorted ideas and motifs and making them his own -- a gift that enabled him to address many different audiences at once, while making ideas that some might find radical somehow familiar and accessible. It was a gift that in some ways mirrored his abilities as the leader of the civil rights movement, tasked with holding together often contentious factions (from more militant figures like Stokely Carmichael to more conservative ones like Roy Wilkins), while finding a way to balance the concerns of grass-roots activists with the need to forge a working alliance with the federal government.
At the same time, Dr. King was also able to nestle his arguments within a historical continuum, lending them the authority of tradition and the weight of association. For some, in his audience, the articulation of his dream for America would have evoked conscious or unconscious memories of Langston Hughes's call in a 1935 poem to ''let America be the dream the dreamers dreamed'' and W. E. B. Du Bois's description of the ''wonderful America, which the founding fathers dreamed.'' His final lines in the March on Washington speech come from a Negro spiritual reminding listeners of slaves' sustaining faith in the possibility of liberation: ''Free at last, free at last; thank God Almighty, we are free at last.''
For those less familiar with African-American music and literature, there were allusions with immediate, patriotic connotations. Much the way Lincoln redefined the founders' vision of America in his Gettysburg Address by invoking the Declaration of Independence, so Dr. King in his ''Dream'' speech makes references to both the Gettysburg Address and the Declaration of Independence. These deliberate echoes helped universalize the moral underpinnings of the civil rights movement and emphasized that its goals were only as revolutionary as the founding fathers' original vision of the United States. Dr. King's dream for America's ''citizens of color'' was no more, no less than the American Dream of a country where ''all men are created equal.''
As for Dr. King's quotation of ''My Country, 'Tis of Thee'' -- an almost de facto national anthem, familiar even to children -- it underscored civil rights workers' patriotic belief in the project of reinventing America. For Dr. King, it might have elicited personal memories, too. The night his home was bombed during the bus boycott in Montgomery, Ala., endangering the lives of his wife, Coretta, and their infant daughter, he calmed the crowd gathered in front of their house, saying, ''I want you to love our enemies.'' Some of his supporters reportedly broke into song, including hymns and ''My Country, 'Tis of Thee.''
The March on Washington and Dr. King's ''Dream'' speech would play an important role in helping pass the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and the pivotal Selma to Montgomery march that he led in 1965 would provide momentum for the passage later that year of the Voting Rights Act. Though Dr. King received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964, his exhausting schedule (he had been giving hundreds of speeches a year) and his frustration with schisms in the civil rights movement and increasing violence in the country led to growing weariness and depression before his assassination in 1968.
The knowledge that Dr. King gave his life to the cause lends an added poignancy to the experience of hearing his speeches today. And so does being reminded now -- in the second term of Barack Obama's presidency -- of the dire state of race relations in the early 1960s, when towns in the South still had separate schools, restaurants, hotels and bathrooms for blacks and whites, and discrimination in housing and employment was prevalent across the country. Only two and a half months before the ''Dream'' speech, Gov. George Wallace had stood in a doorway at the University of Alabama in an attempt to block two black students from trying to register; the next day the civil rights activist Medgar Evers was assassinated in front of his home in Jackson, Miss.
President Obama, who once wrote about his mother's coming home ''with books on the civil rights movement, the recordings of Mahalia Jackson, the speeches of Dr. King,'' has described the leaders of the movement as ''giants whose shoulders we stand on.'' Some of his own speeches owe a clear debt to Dr. King's ideas and words.
In his 2004 Democratic National Convention keynote address, which brought him to national attention, Mr. Obama channeled Dr. King's vision of hope, speaking of coming ''together as one American family.'' In his 2008 speech about race, he talked, much as Dr. King had, of continuing ''on the path of a more perfect union.'' And in his 2007 speech commemorating the 1965 Selma march, he echoed Dr. King's remarks about Exodus, describing Dr. King and the other civil rights leaders as members of the Moses generation who ''pointed the way'' and ''took us 90 percent of the way there.'' He and his contemporaries were their heirs, Mr. Obama said -- they were members of the Joshua generation with the responsibility of finishing ''the journey Moses had begun.''
Dr. King knew it would not be easy to ''transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood'' -- difficulties that persist today with new debates over voter registration laws and the Trayvon Martin shooting. Dr. King probably did not foresee a black president celebrating the 50th anniversary of his speech in front of the Lincoln Memorial, and surely did not foresee a monument to himself just a short walk away. But he did dream of a future in which the country embarked on ''the sunlit path of racial justice,'' and he foresaw, with bittersweet prescience, that 1963, as he put it, was ''not an end, but a beginning.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Is Dragged Down By Fears of U.S. Strike on Syria

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Fears of an escalating conflict in Syria rippled across financial markets on Tuesday, sinking stocks, lifting gold and pushing the price of oil to its highest in a year and a half. 
The increasing possibility of United States military strikes raised worries on Wall Street that energy trade in the region could be disrupted, raising fuel costs for consumers and businesses.
''If Syria becomes drawn out and becomes a long-term issue, it's going to show up in things like gas prices,'' said Chris Costanzo, investment officer with Tanglewood Wealth Management in Houston.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 170.33 points, or 1.1 percent, to 14,776.13, the lowest in two months.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 26.30 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,630.48, and the Nasdaq composite fell 79.05 points, or 2.2 percent, to 3,578.52.
''The law of unintended consequences and the history of previous military interventions in the region is not a recipe for political and economic stability,'' said Neil MacKinnon, global macro strategist at VTB Capital.
The stock sell-off was broad. All 10 industry sectors in the S.& P. 500 index were in the red, and only 31 of the index's 500 stocks rose. Utilities and other high dividend-paying stocks mostly escaped the selling.
The impact was not just in stocks. Gold prices advanced and government bond prices jumped because traders see those investments as holding their value better in times of uncertainty. Gold rose $27, or 2 percent, to $1,420 an ounce. In the market for government bonds, the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 21/32 to 98 6/32, and its yield declined to 2.71 percent, from 2.79 percent late Monday.
While Syria itself has little oil, traders feared an intervention in Syria could cause further instability in the Middle East and possibly disrupt the flow of oil from the region. Oil surged $3.09, or 2.9 percent, to close at $109.01 a barrel, the highest closing price since February 2012.
''People worry about this becoming a worst-case scenario and turning into a regional conflict,'' said Bill Stone, chief investment strategist at PNC Asset Management.
Energy prices dragged down the airline industry on concerns that higher oil prices could lead to higher fuel costs. United Continental Holdings, the world's largest airline by revenue, dropped $2.15, or 7.2 percent, to $27.71, and Delta Air Lines lost $1.16, or 5.7 percent, to $19.11.
Mr. Stone said oil prices could start weighing on consumer spending down the road, but it was still too early to gauge the longer-term impact.
The average price for gasoline remained unchanged at $3.54 a gallon. Prices have held steady over the last week, and are down 9 cents from a month ago.
In corporate news, the discount shoe seller DSW rose $6.43, or 7.9 percent, to $87.75 after the company reported an adjusted profit of 97 cents a share, easily beating analysts' estimate of 80 cents a share, according to FactSet.
And J. C. Penney fell 18 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $13.17 after the company's biggest investor, William A. Ackman, said on Monday that he planned to sell his entire stake in the chain.

HEADLINE: Michigan Passes Bill To Expand Medicaid

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- The fierce struggle among Republicans over whether to make Medicaid available to more low-income people played out in Michigan on Tuesday as the Republican governor, Rick Snyder, narrowly succeeded in swaying enough conservative senators in the State Legislature to accept the expansion, which was part of President Obama's health care law.
Mr. Snyder's preferred bill -- one he had lobbied for intensely for months -- initially fell short by one vote, but the governor salvaged a deal hours later. The vote in the Republican-controlled Senate was 20 to 18, with only 8 Republicans in favor. The Michigan House, which had earlier approved a similar measure, will need to vote on the Senate version before Mr. Snyder can sign the bill. 
''The Affordable Care Act has probably been one of the most divisive issues that our country has faced in the last few years, and many people do have strong opinions both for and against,'' Mr. Snyder said after the vote. ''I just ask that all Michiganders step back and look to say this isn't about the Affordable Care Act. This is about one element that we control here in Michigan that we can make a difference in here in people's lives.''
While the authors of the federal health care law intended to expand Medicaid, the federal and state health program for poor people, and at least initially pay for the expansion, the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could opt out, setting up a struggle that has played out in the states largely along partisan lines.
Like Mr. Snyder, some Republican governors have found themselves at odds with their own party's legislative caucuses in state capitals like Lansing that are dominated by Republicans.
In Arizona, which eventually approved an expansion, Gov. Jan Brewer found vehement opposition from some lawmakers. In Florida, legislators have resisted expansion, despite Gov. Rick Scott's support. And in Ohio, Gov. John R. Kasich's push for expansion has so far not been successful.
For months, the fight in Michigan, which has the nation's 10-largest uninsured population, has been intense. Mr. Snyder, a former businessman in his first term, said the expansion would ultimately save money, control medical costs and help the state's economy. That pitted him against more conservative members of his own party, and led some Tea Party leaders in the state to say he will lose support if he seeks re-election next year.
On the floor of the Michigan Senate on Tuesday, the debate was heated, though lawmakers said the discussions -- particularly those within the Republican caucus -- had been even more tense behind closed doors.
Advocates praised the measure as fiscally sensible for the state, given the promise of federal money, and crucial for hundreds of thousands of low-income residents without insurance.
Already, Medicaid covers more than 1.8 million people in the state, Michigan officials said, and the expansion would ultimately grant coverage to more than 400,000 others. People making up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level -- or about $15,500 a year for a single person -- would newly be covered.
''It's a benefit to every person in the state of Michigan,'' said State Senator Gretchen Whitmer, the Democratic leader, said on the floor. ''It's good public policy, and it makes good fiscal sense.''
Senator Roger Kahn, a Republican, told his colleagues, ''This is not Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act.'' Instead, he argued, the measure will reform the costs of medicine across the state and become what he described as ''a national model'' for other states.
But opponents said a Medicaid expansion would represent tacit approval of Mr. Obama's health care law. They said it would encourage big government and be an irresponsible promise of spending by Michigan in the years ahead. Senator Mike Green, a Republican, described the plan as a promise of ''federal funny money.''
And Senator Patrick J. Colbeck, another Republican opponent, said, ''We're spending money we do not have,'' adding, ''And we're forcing decisions right now onto our youth.''
In June, the Michigan House approved the Medicaid expansion with support from Democrats and enough members from that chamber's Republican majority. But the State Senate, where Republicans hold 26 of 38 seats, moved more slowly, with some conservative Republicans openly rejecting Mr. Snyder's views, refusing to call a vote and proposing alternatives.
At one point, Mr. Snyder, who regularly promotes a gentle-sounding political philosophy of ''relentless positive action,'' flew home early from a trade mission to Israel and had uncharacteristically sharp words for the Senate, telling them to ''take a vote, not a vacation.''
In recent days, the struggle intensified. The governor's office took part in urgent, private conversations, lawmakers said, while advocates for and against the measure led demonstrations, ad campaigns and phone banks around Michigan.
''We firmly believe that a vote to support Medicaid expansion is a vote to support the president's health care law,'' said one opponent, Annie Patnaude, deputy state director of Americans for Prosperity-Michigan. Protesters on the other side of the issue appeared in Lansing on Tuesday, saying it was high time for a vote.

HEADLINE: For Long-Shot New Jersey Senate Candidate, Passion on Trail Comes With No Filter

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
NEWARK -- To start his ''Expose Cory Booker'' tour, Steve Lonegan stood in front of one of this troubled city's more rundown schools this month and attacked the mayor's record on education.
''He can issue all the Cory Booker platitudes -- Cory-tudes -- that he wants,'' Mr. Lonegan said. ''Cory Booker has failed people.''
Then he showed up days later at the scene of a double homicide, and accused Mayor Booker of being ''too busy hanging out with Oprah'' and ''tweeting about Winnie the Pooh'' to address the city's problems.
''Finally,'' Mr. Lonegan said, ''Mayor Booker issued a tweet mourning someone's passing. But it wasn't the two men shot dead in Cory Booker's Newark on Friday night. It was Michael Ansara, the Klingon from Star Trek.'' 
Even if Mr. Lonegan were not running against a nationally known Democrat, his campaign to be the first Republican in 40 years elected to the United States Senate from New Jersey would be a long shot. But he has no intention of letting it be dull.
The election to replace Senator Frank R. Lautenberg, who died in June, presents a stark contrast: Mr. Booker, the mayor of the state's largest city, invites comparisons to President Obama; Mr. Lonegan, a former mayor of suburban Bogota, N.J., intends to go to Washington and dismantle the Obama agenda.
Though Mr. Lonegan has taken in just $325,000 to Mr. Booker's $8.6 million in campaign contributions, Mr. Lonegan's campaign argues that he can take advantage of the unusual conditions of the special election -- it will be held on Oct. 16, a Wednesday -- to turn out a high number of conservative voters who rally passionately to his message.
But it is not clear how many of them there are.
New Jersey's Republican voters tend to reward moderation. Mr. Lonegan tends more toward outrage: railing against federal aid to Hurricane Sandy victims, for example, by saying that the state should ''suck it up and be responsible for taking care of ourselves.''
''I don't think I'm a flamethrower,'' he said, responding to a characterization used by Mr. Booker. ''I advocate for issues, I advocate for them passionately. That's just who I am.''
Mr. Lonegan, 57, was most recently the state director for Americans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group backed by the Koch brothers. He was Tea Party before anyone knew to call it a movement. As his favorite reading he cites works by Friedrich Hayek and Ludwig Von Mises, and other limited-or-no-government treatises of the libertarian canon.
He argues that the Federal Reserve's attempts to stimulate the economy have devalued the nation's currency, that President Obama's health care law will destroy the economy, that military spending could be cut and entire federal agencies, including energy and education, eliminated to rein in spending.
''I'm very deeply concerned for my kids -- and I know it's cliché -- that we're on a trajectory toward economic collapse,'' he said last week, sitting in a restaurant in Hunterdon County. He was there for the biggest coup of his campaign, an endorsement from Gov. Chris Christie, his opponent in the 2009 primary for governor.
''People should be able to work hard and save and accumulate wealth and a better future, and not have it taken away by the government, whether it's through taxation, or regulation, or debasing the dollar,'' he said.
His models in the Senate are all Tea Party freshmen: Ted Cruz of Texas (''brilliant,'' he called him), Mike Lee of Utah (''very principled'') and Rand Paul of Kentucky (''sharp, aggressive'').
He comes across as a younger, more New Jersey-esque version of Ron Paul: formal, serious, not so much flamethrower as simply annoyed -- by the Affordable Care Act, by the Federal Reserve, by having to suffer fools.
''I am one of the few people who has read Dodd-Frank,'' Mr. Lonegan said, by way of explaining his antipathy for the bank regulations passed after the economic meltdown of 2008.
As to Mr. Booker's celebrity, he sounds mystified: ''What does that do for the country? There's no substance here at all. It's all, like, glitz.''
Mr. Lonegan grew up in Bogota and moved in with his grandparents after his father died when Mr. Lonegan was 16. He received a diagnosis of retinitis pigmentosa as a teenager; the disease slowly claimed his sight, eventually leaving him legally blind. But he recalls his childhood as blessed because he grew up in a household where people worked hard and saved money.
He met his wife, Lorraine, at William Paterson University, where he was captain of the football team, and they started a kitchen cabinet business.
He joined the local Republican club as a hobby, and was elected mayor of his hometown in 1995, serving for three consecutive terms.
''By double-digit margins,'' he noted, in a town that voted for ''Al Gore, Bill Clinton, John Kerry, Bob Menendez, Frank Lautenberg, Jim McGreevey, Jon Corzine and Barack Obama -- and me.''
His success, he said, was focusing on fiscal issues. But he battled with the police unions, and stirred controversy when he pushed to make English the official language of Bogota after McDonald's put up a Spanish billboard that he considered ''divisive.'' He also sued, unsuccessfully, to stop the state from borrowing money without voter approval.
He lost when he ran for Congress in 1998 and in the 2005 primary for governor. In the 2009 primary against Mr. Christie, he won 42 percent of the vote in a sharply negative race.
Mr. Christie spent 5 minutes 7 seconds giving his endorsement last Tuesday, holding up Mr. Lonegan's hand briefly but not sharing the bear hug he offers even voters on the street. Mr. Christie said he was ''proud'' of Mr. Lonegan as the party's nominee.
''I know Steve is going to give Cory Booker some tussle over the next 60 days,'' he said.
That was clear two days later, when Mr. Booker gave a speech to outline the differences between him and Mr. Lonegan, calling him ''someone who stands way out on the fringes.''
Mr. Lonegan responded with his own hastily scheduled news conference the next hour, calling Mr. Booker, who is frequently criticized in his own party for his moderate views, ''a far left liberal extremist.'' Conservative crowds reacted excitedly to Mr. Lonegan, cheering when he talked about the ''commie -- I mean the Common Core'' curriculum in schools.
But his bluntness has attracted some unwanted attention, too. When someone from his staff posted a racially charged message on his campaign's Twitter account in early August -- comparing the black neighborhoods of Newark to foreign countries -- Mr. Lonegan ordered it taken down. But he then criticized ''political correctness,'' saying that his opponents ''will use any chance they can to pull the race card.''
In an interview he said, ''I don't have a filter, that's my problem.''
In his work at Americans for Prosperity, Mr. Lonegan taught conservatives to be ''citizen lobbyists,'' and he says he will rely on that kind of grass roots appeal to win the election.
''I'm going to mobilize the base, and I'm going to focus on issues,'' he said. ''Cory Booker's going to run on name ID and run around with Oprah Winfrey and the 'Desperate Housewife' lady.'' (He was referring to Eva Longoria, who has campaigned with Mr. Booker.)
Mr. Lonegan's wife, however, would not mind the chance to tell their story to Ms. Winfrey, and wrote to her to ask. Ms. Lonegan said she has not heard back.
''It's not going to matter,'' Mr. Lonegan told his wife. ''She's a political hack.'' He put his fingers to his mouth. ''Sorry. No filter.''

HEADLINE: Wooing Us Down The Aisle

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MOSS

 BODY:
EL PASO -- Samuel Pulido walked into his local grocery store on a sweltering day, greeted by cool air and the fantasy-world ambience of the modern supermarket.
Soft music drifted. Neon-bright colors turned his head this way and that. ''WOW!!!'' gasped the posters hanging from entranceway racks, heralding the sugary drinks, wavy chips and Berry Colossal Crunch being thrust his way.
Then he looked down at his grocery cart and felt quite a different tug. Inside the front of the buggy, hooked onto its red steel frame, was a mirror. It stretched nearly a foot across, and as Mr. Pulido gripped the cart a little more tightly, it filled with the reflection of his startled face.
The sight was meant to be a splash of reality in the otherwise anonymous la-la land of food shopping, a reminder of who he was, how he looked and perhaps what he had come in for. And if the spell cast by the store wasn't entirely broken, it seemed to have lost at least some of its grip. 
''I'm looking at myself, and thinking, 'O.K., now what?' '' he said.
The mirror is part of an effort to get Americans to change their eating habits, by two social scientists outmaneuvering the processed-food giants on their own turf, using their own tricks: the distracting little nudges and cues that confront a supermarket shopper at every turn. The researchers, like many government agencies and healthy-food advocates these days, are out to increase consumption of fruits and vegetables. But instead of preaching about diabetes or slapping taxes on junk food, they gently prod shoppers -- so gently, in fact, that it's hard to believe the results.
In one early test at a store in Virginia, grocery carts carried a strip of yellow duct tape that divided the baskets neatly in half; a flier instructed shoppers to put their fruits and vegetables in the front half of the cart. Average produce sales per customer jumped to $8.85 from $3.99.
Here in El Paso a few months ago, the researchers focused on the floor, laying down large plastic mats bearing huge green arrows that pointed shoppers to the produce aisle. The outcome surprised no one more than the grocer.
''In retail, the customer tends to go to the right,'' said Tim Taylor, the produce director for Lowe's, Pay and Save, a regional grocery chain that let the scientists in to experiment with their arrows and mirrors. ''But I watched when the arrows were down, pointing left, and that's where people went: left, 9 out of 10.''
With those same guinea-pig customers, the scientists tinkered again with the cart, creating a glossy placard that hung inside the baskets like the mirrors. In English and Spanish, the signs told shoppers how much produce the average customer was buying (five items a visit), and which fruits and vegetables were the biggest sellers (bananas, limes and avocados) -- information that, in scientific parlance, conveys social norms, or acceptable behavior.
By the second week, produce sales had jumped 10 percent, with a whopping 91 percent rise for those participating in the government nutrition program called Women, Infants and Children. Lowe's was so excited that it now plans to put the placards in every cart at its 22 stores in El Paso and nearby Las Cruces, N.M., and perhaps later at all 146 of its stores.
For grocers, there is one potential glitch: While produce sales climbed in these trials, the store's total sales remained mostly the same. That meant shoppers spent less on nonproduce items. ''They're moving preference from one side of the store to the other, which is wonderful,'' said Michael Kelly, a senior program officer at the Paso Del Norte Health Foundation, which is financing the research. ''People still stay on their budgets, get more nutrients and less of the processed -- well, let's just say bad -- stuff.''
But the owners of Lowe's are smiling, too, because along with the meat counter, the produce aisle is one of the most profitable parts of a grocery store, with large volumes and higher-than-average markups from the wholesale cost. So even if sales of frozen pizza and potato chips dip, the grocer's net profit will rise if zucchini gains.
Finding a profit motive in social policy fits well with the politically conservative views of the researchers engaged in this supermarket manipulation: two Republican-leaning academics at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces.
One, Collin R. Payne, a 38-year-old associate professor, graduated from Brigham Young University and then worked on a string of groundbreaking studies at the Food and Brand Lab at Cornell University that affirmed a concept known as mindful eating: the notion that if you put food on a smaller plate, you'll probably eat less.
The same idea, he says, extends to shopping. ''The more mindless you are when you shop, the more you are going to be poked and prodded to buy the manufacturer's products,'' Mr. Payne said. ''We're trying to give consumers the same power the companies have.''
His colleague, a Romanian émigré named Mihai Niculescu, 37, came up with the mirror idea by marrying his own specialty in business marketing, known as behavioral choice, with research done by others on self-image. Over a fully loaded Mexican meal at the famed L & J Cafe here, he said his own sizable belly gave him an insider's edge when studying the marketing cues that lead to overconsumption. ''Eating this, I don't realize I'm overweight, until I look at myself,'' he said.
A paper the two men wrote last year for The Agricultural and Resource Economics Review said the conventional methods promoted in Washington and elsewhere to encourage Americans to eat more fruits and vegetables have either failed, or require taxpayer money at a time when food stamps are at political risk. These efforts include ads and store display signs promoting produce as healthful, and reducing its cost through tools like additional vouchers for low-income women.
By contrast, Mr. Payne and Mr. Niculescu are pursuing a strategy that behavioral scientists call nudge marketing, an idea popularized by the 2008 book ''Nudge,'' by the former Obama administration regulatory affairs administrator Cass R. Sunstein and the University of Chicago professor Richard H. Thaler.
Nudge marketing calls for applying just the right amount of pressure to persuade: not too little, not too much. In the El Paso grocery trials, using both the green arrows on the floor with the green placards in the carts caused produce sales to fall.
''It nudged too hard,'' Mr. Payne said.
By several measures, El Paso is one tough testing ground for these studies. Thirty-two percent of the city's adults are obese, and 12.2 percent have diabetes, exceeding the statewide average, according to Texas health department estimates. The fast-growing Hispanic population has become a favorite marketing target for processed-food manufacturers.
Much of that was evident at the Lowe's store where Mr. Pulido and other shoppers encountered the mirrors. Many of its customers are significantly overweight, and gravitate toward the chip and soda aisles. As in many supermarkets, the store's produce section, while decently stocked with eye-pleasing displays, gets only about 10 percent of the total space and none of the prime real estate that drives the most sales: the front-of-the-store display towers, which companies rent from the store, and spots by the checkout lanes.
''That's Frito-Lay, that's Frito-Lay, that's Frito-Lay,'' said the manager, Gloria Narro, spinning around in the center of the store to point out all the displays for that company's snacks. ''We're all trying to eat healthier, but there's so much competition for us,'' she said. ''Right next door is a store known for its fresh meat. Walmart is down the street. Walgreens and CVS just opened up, carrying whatever you need in food.''
The scientists have other tricks up their sleeves. They recently gave Lowe's a research paper with 56 ideas for increasing produce sales, like putting a rack of onions near the meat counter, for making fajitas.
But it's their retooling of shopping carts that is drawing the interest of marketing and obesity experts alike.
''I think what they're doing is very innovative and clever,'' said Michael R. Lowe, a Drexel University psychology professor and longtime researcher on weight control. ''If you put up some cues that remind people of their weight or healthy eating, without hitting them over the head, they will go and choose healthier items. The mirror might do that, but the question will be, 'What kind of memory association will their body elicit?' And that is hard to know beforehand. For those who are overweight, it might elicit the sense of, 'Oh, I need to lose weight.' Or, 'I don't like to see myself because I'm so big,' which might lead to choosing healthier food.''
Mr. Payne and Mr. Niculescu acknowledge that the mirror is still an unproven tool and hope to conduct a formal trial later this year.
They started by placing a full-length mirror just inside the store's entrance, which shoppers either ignored or used for some impromptu primping. The mirrored cart was more arresting, as Kathy Saenz, one of the store's customer service representatives, noticed when she tried the cart out. ''My hair looks that bad?'' she asked.
Mr. Pulido, who was surprised to see his face in the mirror, didn't comment on his physique, which is fairly trim. But noting the general condition of his fellow customers, he offered researchers a suggestion.
''You should hang it a little lower,'' he said, ''so you show people's bellies.''
(Buy Me!)
Scientists are beginning to study ways to get shoppers to buy more produce, but grocers and their suppliers have already spent years perfecting strategies to sell processed foods. Here's a sampling of tactics:
THE SWEETEST ITEMS are sold at eye level, midway along aisles, where shoppers' attention lingers longest.
THE ENDS OF AISLES are huge revenue generators, especially for soda, which makes 45 percent of its sales through racks there, according to the Coca-Cola Retailing Research Council.
IMPULSE PURCHASES (60 percent of purchases are unplanned) can be encouraged by placing items next to checkouts.
FREE-STANDING DISPLAYS are also effective toward the rear of the supermarket and on the left side of aisles. Research cited by the Coca-Cola council shows that shoppers move through the store counterclockwise, from the back to the front; in the aisles, they buy items mostly from shelves to their left.
SPRINKLING THE SAME PRODUCT throughout the store, rather than grouping it in one spot, will boost sales through repetitive exposure.
GROUPING THE INGREDIENTS for a meal in one spot can attract home cooks pressed for time.
POSTING HEALTH-RELATED INFORMATION -- online, and on kiosks and shelf tags -- can link groceries to good health in shoppers' minds, even though only 23 percent of them say they always look for nutritional information on labels.

HEADLINE: President, Not Preacher, but Speaking More on Race

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Sitting in the Roosevelt Room with prominent African-American religious leaders, President Obama on Monday mused about how far the nation had come in the 50 years since the March on Washington led by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and how far it still had to go.
A president who often shies away from talking about race is set to deliver his own speech on Wednesday from the Lincoln Memorial. One thing he knew, he said, was that he could not fill Dr. King's shoes. ''He was discouraging us from comparing him to Dr. King,'' said the Rev. Alvin Love of Chicago, one of the preachers who were there.
For Mr. Obama, Dr. King has been an idol, role model and burden since he assumed the presidency. He keeps a bust of the civil rights leader in the Oval Office along with a framed program from the 1963 march, and some of his favorite lines have been adopted from Dr. King. But as the nation's first black president, Mr. Obama has found that no matter how much supporters may want to compare them, he cannot be a latter-day Dr. King. 
He is a politician juggling multiple constituencies, not a preacher leading a movement. He is a president on the verge of a new war in the Middle East, not a peace activist extolling nonviolence. He has spent nearly five years in the White House wrestling with his own identity and the essential tension between his barrier-breaking role and his fundamental desire to be judged like any other president.
After a first term in which he often disappointed supporters by not talking more about race, Mr. Obama is now speaking more, and taking action, on issues like income inequality, voting rights and criminal justice. Freed from most of the urgent crises he inherited, and the imperative of winning re-election, he at times seems liberated to give voice to causes that have animated his time in public life.
But he still seeks a balance. The nation's attention will be drawn to his speech on Wednesday, but the Roosevelt Room meeting on Monday and an East Room reception on Tuesday night were closed to the news media. As Mr. Obama talks about issues historically tied to race, he often frames them in terms of class, economics and opportunity, aiming to speak for a broader audience than Dr. King did in 1963.
''He sees it as a very different role at a very different period of time,'' said Valerie Jarrett, his close friend and senior adviser. ''Martin Luther King was a preacher, a civil rights leader.'' Mr. Obama often says he ''stands on their shoulders,'' she added, but ''he felt the responsibility to pick up the baton, not as a civil rights leader but as a president of the United States.''
That means that he does not often share a public stage with the Rev. Al Sharpton. But Mr. Sharpton was among those at the Roosevelt Room meeting and at a private session with the president weeks earlier.
Mr. Sharpton said Mr. Obama should not be equated with civil rights pioneers. ''In the African-American community and in the media they project him as the new Martin Luther King,'' he said in an interview. ''But he's the new John Kennedy. A president shouldn't dream. A president should legislate and guide.''
Yet others remain disillusioned by what they see as Mr. Obama's failure to bring meaningful change. Tavis Smiley, the radio host, said the president has been ''timid'' and ''almost silent'' on the very issues Dr. King addressed.
''If you're not going to address racism, if you're not going to address poverty, if you're not going to address militarism, if you're going to dance around all three of them, then you're not doing justice to Dr. King, and you might as well stay home,'' Mr. Smiley said in an interview.
Mr. Smiley is a sore subject in the West Wing, where presidential advisers bristle at his criticism. They argue that Mr. Obama is committed to such issues, noting that he got his start as an organizer working in poor black communities. They point to his speech on race during the 2008 campaign and his speech on inequality in Osawatomie, Kan., in 2011.
But they acknowledge that choice and circumstance have put more focus on such issues in Mr. Obama's second term. In the days after his re-election, aides said that Mr. Obama told them he wanted to overhaul criminal justice policies that have disproportionately affected young African-American men. He also said he wanted to focus more on income inequality, and he used his Inaugural Address to pledge to fight what he saw as restrictions on voting rights.
Alan Krueger, until recently the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said that Mr. Obama's health care plan would go a long way to reducing disparities, but that Mr. Obama is freer now to address such issues because the financial crisis of his first term has abated.
''We first had to make sure the system was sound,'' Mr. Krueger said. ''Nothing else would work if we were still collapsing.''
As much as he talks about being a uniter, Mr. Obama's presidency has proved to be polarizing across racial lines. While 89 percent of black Americans approve of his job performance, just 34 percent of whites agree, according to recent Gallup polling. And so he tries to frame issues in race-neutral terms.
As he opened a series of speeches on the middle class in Galesburg, Ill., last month, he recalled that the March on Washington was also about jobs. ''When you think about the coalition that brought about civil rights, it wasn't just folks who believed in racial equality,'' he said. ''It was people who believed in working folks having a fair shot.''
Outside events have also forced race back into the spotlight, and onto the Obama agenda. After the Supreme Court overturned part of the Voting Rights Act, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. went to court seeking to use other elements of the law to challenge a Texas statute. The Trayvon Martin case in Florida led Mr. Obama to make a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room to talk about the sting of being trailed in stores as a young black man.
After that, Mr. Holder issued an order intended to avoid long mandatory prison terms for low-level drug offenses, and Mr. Obama plans to seek legislation to rewrite sentencing laws.
''Part of that focus just by definition is on race because of the sheer statistical, disproportionate numbers of African-American men who are impacted by the criminal justice system,'' said Kathryn Ruemmler, the White House counsel. ''But I would say that race is not the focus of this effort at all. It's more the byproduct.'' Instead, she said, ''the focus is more about disparity'' and whether government is being proportionate in punishment.
Critics like Mr. Smiley said they admired the comments on Mr. Martin and actions on voting rights and prison sentencing. But they asked why it took so long. ''He was not out front on the issue, which is too often the case,'' Mr. Smiley said. ''When it comes to race and poverty, he is reactive, not proactive.''
Some supporters agreed that the Martin case prompted Mr. Obama to address the topic, and that he rose to the occasion. ''What we're really seeing more,'' said Mr. Love, the pastor of Lilydale First Baptist Church in Chicago, ''is basically him speaking out of his heart on those issues.''

HEADLINE: China Expands Inquiry On Graft to Oil Industry

BYLINE: By CHRIS BUCKLEY

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Chinese Communist Party's drive against corruption moved into the powerful and politically delicate oil sector this week, as the authorities announced that four executives of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation were under investigation.
On Tuesday, the Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of China said on its Web site that three oil executives -- Li Hualin, a deputy general manager of China National Petroleum; Ran Xinquan, a vice president of PetroChina, the company's listed unit; and Wang Daofu, the chief geologist of PetroChina -- were ''suspected of grave violations of discipline and are currently undergoing investigation,'' by an anti-corruption agency. PetroChina also announced that the three men were under investigation and had resigned ''due to personal reasons.'' 
A day earlier, authorities revealed an investigation into a deputy general manager of China National Petroleum, Wang Yongchun, for suspected ''disciplinary violations,'' generally considered to be corruption, embezzlement or taking bribes.
The investigations indicate that the Communist Party's effort to fight corruption extends beyond the government to powerful parts of the state-dominated economy. The party leader, Xi Jinping, came to power in November with promises that he would rein in official corruption and self-enrichment, which has become a major source of public discontent.
On Tuesday, the Communist Party's Politburo, a council of 25 senior leaders, approved a five-year plan to curb corruption, the official news agency, Xinhua, reported. The report did not give details of the plan, but the official summation of the Politburo meeting noted that the party would ''sternly investigate and punish violations of party rules and laws by party members and officials,'' and ''give full play to deterrent force.''
Looming over this case is the recent trial of Bo Xilai, the former Politburo member, accused of taking bribes, embezzling and abusing his power to protect his wife from murder allegations. The trial of Mr. Bo, spread over five days and reported in unusual detail through a court microblog, highlighted what many citizens see as the brazen greed of China's political elite. A verdict is expected in early September.
''I think there's a dynamic here that suggests this may prove to be a more rigorous crackdown than we've seen for years,'' said Andrew Wedeman, a professor of political science at Georgia State University in Atlanta who researches corruption in China. ''Way too many officials have been wearing Rolex watches and driving Mercedes.''
China's oil sector has long been the domain of powerful party officials, making any investigations politically thorny. For example, Zhou Yongkang, a former general manager of China National Petroleum, later became the head of China's domestic security organization, retiring last year. Such close ties have prompted speculation about whether powerful party figures could be ensnared in the inquiries.
China National Petroleum ''is a huge company, China's biggest energy company, but these people being investigated aren't the highest in the company,'' said Lin Boqiang, director of the China Center for Energy Economics Research at Xiamen University in eastern China. ''It's relatively sensitive because ordinary people have so many complaints about the monopoly behavior of C.N.P.C. and other oil companies.''
But many observers are skeptical that officials have the will and the power to investigate their colleagues, who can appeal to patrons for protection from inquiries. Typically, corruption inquiries are initially carried out by party agencies, which then decide whether to hand over the matter for criminal investigation.
''It's a challenge, because there's an awful lot of power concentrated in these people's hands,'' said Professor Wedeman, the expert on corruption in China. ''That concentration gives them the power to engage in corruption, and the power to cover it up.''

HEADLINE: Lessons In Maryland For Costs At Hospitals

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
CUMBERLAND, Md. -- This hardscrabble city at the base of the Appalachians makes for an unlikely hotbed of health care innovation.
Yet Western Maryland Health Systems, the major hospital serving this poor and isolated region, is carrying out an experiment that could leave a more profound imprint on the delivery of health care than President Obama's reforms.
Over the last three years, the hospital has taken its services outside its walls. It has opened a diabetes clinic, a wound center and a behavioral health clinic. It has hired people to follow up with older, sicker patients once they are discharged. It has added primary care practices in some neighborhoods.
The goal, seemingly so simple, has so far proved elusive elsewhere: as much as possible, keep people out of hospitals, where the cost of health care is highest. Here, the experiment seems to be working. 
Hospital admissions here are down 15 percent. Readmissions have fallen, too. In 2011, 16 percent of people who had been discharged went back into the hospital. Now, that figure is 9 percent. Many patients report that they are happier with the care.
And Western Maryland has reaped financial rewards. In the fiscal year ending in June, the system made an operating profit of $15 million on about $370 million in revenue, said Barry P. Ronan, the chief executive. That's a spectacular return, given that the average margin at hospitals across the state is a meager 0.8 percent.
Western Maryland's initiatives to take charge of people's health, rather than simply provide services for a fee, fit a core objective of federal health care reform: changing hospitals and related facilities into something resembling an Accountable Care Organization.
Yet the innovations taking place in this corner of Appalachia rest on a policy that the architects of President Obama's health care reforms never tried to emulate. Indeed, this innovation was only possible because in Maryland, hospital fees are subject to government price controls.
Western Maryland Healthcare System is one of 10 rural hospitals that agreed with the state's Health Services Cost Review Commission to accept a guaranteed budget every year to take charge of the health care of the community they serve.
If revenue comes in under the budget one year, the hospitals are allowed to increase prices the next to make up for the deficit. If revenue exceeds the budget, however, they must reduce prices to give the surplus back.
The system, adopted by Western Maryland in 2010, helps spur innovation. But it was only possible because Maryland has a commission that sets the fee that hospitals can charge patients regardless of whether they are covered by Medicare or private insurance, or are uninsured. Everyone pays roughly the same.
Price controls are not unique to Maryland. Medicare has regulated prices for decades. Other states -- including New York, New Jersey and Connecticut -- experimented with them in the 1970s, only to drop them in the 1980s and '90s when, for a time, managed care seemed to keep a lid on prices. In West Virginia, price controls have been in place since the 1980s.
Maryland has the longest track record, however. Price controls were put in place in the mid-1970s, when hospital costs had been rising at an alarming pace.
They addressed ''the price dominance of hospitals, which are often monopolies or oligopolies and have a lot of price-setting power,'' John Colmers, who heads the commission, told me.
At a stroke, the controls turned hospitals into something like public utilities -- with regulated prices and a low but stable profit. Four decades on, the state's experience offers fairly solid evidence that the hospital-as-utility model can work.
Not only could it help usher in changes called for by the Affordable Care Act, as it has at Western Maryland, it could also address head-on Obamacare's main weakness, providing a direct means to rein in the cost of care.
From 1977 to 2010, Maryland's price-regulated hospitals experienced the slowest rise in costs per patient in the country, according to the commission. Before the advent of price controls, the cost per each patient admitted into a Maryland hospital exceeded the national average by 26 percent. In 2011, it was 4 percent lower.
What's more, costs are more evenly spread. On average, hospitals across the country charge private patients about 44 percent more than patients on Medicare and Medicaid. The uninsured -- who don't have the clout to negotiate lower fees -- must pay a sticker price that includes a 220 percent markup over costs, on average.
This, hospitals say, makes up for uncompensated care and the fact that Medicare and Medicaid pay almost 8 percent less than cost.
In Maryland, Medicare and Medicaid get only a 6 percent volume discount compared to private payers. And the sticker price markup over costs is only 33 percent. All hospitals contribute proportionately to a pot to cover uncompensated care -- and this cost is incorporated into their regulated rates.
Unsurprisingly, health insurance in Maryland is among the cheapest in the country. Health plans that will operate on the new health exchanges created under the federal reforms will charge among the lowest premiums of any state.
Could price controls work nationwide? Studies have found that they helped manage costs in other states that later abandoned them, including New York, Massachusetts and New Jersey.
They didn't work everywhere, however. Maryland hospitals bought into the system because Medicare accepted paying the higher rates set by the commission as long as increases in the cost per patient -- measured from the base year of 1981 -- came in lower than Medicare's national average. This provided hundreds of millions in extra revenue from the federal government.
But in Washington State, regulation couldn't keep costs down in the face of resistance from the hospital industry. And even Maryland's regulations have had trouble controlling the volume of care.
The commission has no control over physicians' decisions, the primary drivers of health expenditures. It hasn't figured out how to transport the global budget used in Western Maryland to urban settings, where hospitals could cut costs simply by encouraging patients to go to the hospital down the block.
Indeed, Maryland's cost controls are an example of how difficult calibrating regulation could be.
As Maryland's hospitals have done a better job keeping healthier people out, they have ended up with sicker, more expensive patients, raising their unit cost. At hospitals like Western Maryland, a fixed budget means that each person kept out of the hospital automatically raises the cost of each patient in it.
This is threatening the Medicare waiver, which relies on keeping costs per patient low. It has forced the commission to authorize very small price increases of late. ''Hospitals have taken it in the stomach in the last four years,'' said Carmela Coyle, president of the Maryland Hospital Association.
The problems seem fixable, though. Global payments might be brought to urban areas by defining the population each hospital must serve and shaping compensation schemes for patients who are treated elsewhere. Mr. Ronan at Western Maryland suggests that global payments could be extended to physicians, too.
Maryland is now negotiating a new measure with the federal government to keep the Medicare waiver -- one that will take account of the growth of hospitals' total costs, rather than the cost per patient.
The rewards seem worth it. Robert Murray, a former head of Maryland's rate-setting commission, estimated that if every hospital in the nation followed Maryland's price guidelines, we would have saved $2 trillion between 1976 and 2008 in lower hospital costs.
Given that health care consumes 18 percent of the nation's economic output, Maryland's experiment seems worth a try.

HEADLINE: Bidding On The Future In Queens

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
When the Queens Museum of Art announced plans for a renovation in 2006, it joined a building boom in which cultural institutions all over the country were adding wings by name-brand architects, seeking their own Bilbaos. And when the recession of 2008 forced many of those institutions to pull back -- worried about whether they needed and could support larger physical plants -- the Queens Museum persevered.
The road wasn't easy; the project was ambitious and took seven years instead of the three originally announced. The budget ballooned to $68 million from $37 million. And though the renovation is now about to be completed -- a reopening is planned for early November -- the hard part is still ahead: with the new building expected to add $1 million to the $4 million annual operating budget, as well as six new full-time positions, will the institution be able to support this larger operation? And, more basically: now that they've built it, will people come?
''It's easy to have a wedding,'' said Tom Finkelpearl, the museum's director. ''It's harder to have a good marriage. It's about sustaining the excitement.'' 
The museum hopes to generate that excitement with its upgraded space, designed by Grimshaw Architects in collaboration with Ammann & Whitney. Expanding into the building's southern half, formerly occupied by the ice-skating rink from the 1964 World's Fair in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, the museum has doubled its footprint to 105,000 square feet. There's a name change, too: soon it will be called just the Queens Museum.
A new soaring atrium is punctuated by an enormous, chandelierlike hanging made of sheets of glass that allow light to be reflected, refracted and diffused. There is a bridge overlooking the atrium, a bookstore, free Wi-Fi and a new cafe with outdoor seating.
The museum wants to signal that it's open -- ''culturally, socially, aesthetically, physically,'' Mr. Finkelpearl said. ''We finally have the physical plant that reflects what we want to do -- that is, really opening the doors.''
With the renovation, the museum is also trying to balance its interest in serving the diverse borough of Queens with the goal of appealing to serious art enthusiasts. So while it is planning shows on contemporary Indian art and on the Taiwan-born Queens photographer Jeff Chien-Hsing Liao, it is also planning a special Andy Warhol exhibition.
''We can simultaneously have that community orientation and maintain high aesthetic and visual standards,'' Mr. Finkelpearl said, adding, ''We're embracing the fabulousness of Queens.'' Underneath the new lighting bay and a few steps down from the main level is a new gallery with a wooden floor but no walls: it will feature sculpture exhibitions and performances. The first work there will be presented by the Mexican artist Pedro Reyes, who will refer to the building's history of hosting the early United Nations General Assembly.
Originally designed by Aymar Embury II as a pavilion for the 1939 World's Fair, the building later served as home to the General Assembly from 1946 to 1950 before welcoming a World's Fair again in 1964. It was for this event that the master builder Robert Moses installed the 9,335-square-foot panoramic model of New York City that remains the museum's crown jewel.
The building became a museum in 1972, though physically it was never ideal. Its western facade, which faces the Grand Central Parkway, was opaque and forbidding and, over the years, became obscured by plants and fencing. ''You couldn't even see the building,'' said Mark Husser, Grimshaw's principal architect on the project.
Visitors would enter from the parking lot, which felt, Mr. Finkelpearl said, ''like you were walking in the side door.''
Over the years, there were stabs at improving the museum. The architect Rafael Viñoly upgraded parts of it in 1994; Eric Owen Moss won a competition to redesign the building in 2002, but that plan was abandoned as insufficient for the museum's needs. In 2005, the museum secured city financing for the project. A year later, Grimshaw was selected through Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's Design and Construction Excellence Initiative, which picks a rotating roster of architects who submit proposals for specific projects.
The redesign features two new grand entrances: one on the parkway side, which will have an illuminated glass facade, and one along the eastern side, which faces the park.
Even if people's ultimate destination is the park, to play soccer, Mr. Finkelpearl said, he hopes they stop at the museum just to use the bathroom or get a drink -- and maybe they'll decide to catch an art exhibition while they're there. (Suggested admission is $8; $4 for students and older visitors.)
To attract more art fans -- and attention -- the museum plans to make its exhibition program more robust, starting with a show of Cuban contemporary art from the collection of Shelley and Donald Rubin, who in June donated $500,000 to the museum to endow a new gallery that will bear their names.
The museum has added more gallery space to accommodate these contemporary art exhibitions, as well as its permanent collection of Tiffany glass and World's Fair memorabilia, hoping to become known as more than just the place to see the Moses panorama, which itself has had a face-lift. The area surrounding it has been carpeted and relighted. ''There are tons of people in New York who haven't seen it,'' Mr. Finkelpearl said. Through a new open-studio program, nine artists have been granted one-year residencies.
As for the increased costs, energy expenses will be covered by the city, which owns the building and contributed $48 million to the renovation. The museum has no debt, and the board has doubled to 24 over the last decade and recently amended its bylaws to allow for 35 members. ''I feel we're going into this from a position of strength,'' Mr. Finkelpearl said.
The museum hopes that individual attendance will double, to 200,000 a year. (Another 100,000 come for community activities and educational programming.) But Mr. Finkelpearl said he is well aware that the going gets tough when the hoopla dies down. So even though he has put in 11 years -- a solid run for a museum director -- and cultural executives often bow out in a blaze of glory after an expansion, he said he plans to remain.
''I feel like I should stay for a while,'' he said. ''It's the second or third year when things get difficult.''

HEADLINE: Tiffany Raises Profit Outlook on Strength of Sales in China

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Tiffany's strong sales in China and higher prices made up for some disappointing business in its home market in the latest quarter, leading the jeweler on Tuesday to raise its profit forecast for the year. 
This summer, fears rose that luxury spending in China might slow as the economy there weakened, but Tiffany is the latest Western brand to report good sales there. Prada and Coach recently posted big gains in the market for luxury goods.
Sales at stores open at least a year in Asia, except for Japan, rose 13 percent in the second quarter, which ended July 31.
But same-store sales were unchanged in the Americas, which is still Tiffany's biggest market. This suggests the company may have faced the same summer pullback that dented sales at chains like Saks and Target.
''Business in the Americas is light,'' said Brian Yarbrough, an Edward Jones analyst. Tiffany continues to struggle with low-end jewelry sales, he added.
Tiffany executives told analysts in a conference call that tourists' purchases had helped business increase at the Fifth Avenue flagship in Manhattan, which generates about one-eighth of sales. Elsewhere, though, there was still reason to be prudent, they said.
''We are maintaining a cautious sales outlook for the Americas until we see solid evidence of an upturn,'' said Patrick McGuiness, the chief financial officer.
Last year, Tiffany's shares came under pressure after it repeatedly lowered its forecasts.
The company now expects a profit of $3.50 to $3.60 a share for the full fiscal year, up 7 cents from its previous forecast range.
Shares of Tiffany fell 85 cents, down 1.04 percent, to $80.82.
The company has struggled to find the right mix of the expensive jewelry for which it is known and the more-affordable silver items that make up its most profitable category.
Still, the pickup in business outside the Americas, where Tiffany is focusing its expansion, reassured Wall Street that the jeweler's growth prospects remain good, Mr. Yarbrough said.
Sales in Asia outside Japan now account for about 22 percent of overall revenue, compared with 11 percent five years ago.

HEADLINE: Sudden Burst of Residential Activity in an Overlooked Slice of TriBeCa

BYLINE: By JULIE SATOW

 BODY:
The area of lower Broadway south of Canal Street in Manhattan has long been characterized by nondescript discount stores and lunchtime counters packed with city workers. It has been mostly ignored by the wave of gentrification to the west that has flooded TriBeCa over the last decade, bringing with it baby carriages, designer boutiques and restaurants.
''Along Broadway has always been the funkier part of TriBeCa where you can still find artists,'' said Erik Torkells, the editor of the Tribeca Citizen, a neighborhood Web site. ''People call it Chibeca because of its proximity to Chinatown.''
This may be about to change. On a four-block stretch of Broadway, between Worth and Walker Streets, nine new residential projects are in the works, bringing more than 430 new condominium units to the area. The burst in activity is largely because of a booming condominium market and insatiable demand for downtown luxury apartments that is rapidly encroaching on commercial spaces and transforming old office towers. 
In the second quarter this year, the average condominium price in TriBeCa reached $1,583 a square foot, nearly 17 percent higher than the $1,354 a square foot posted last year during the similar period, according to data from the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. The median sales price in the neighborhood was $2.75 million in the second quarter, a significant premium over the $1.25 million for all of Manhattan, according to the firm. Land prices for development sites have followed, averaging as much as $500 a buildable square foot in TriBeCa, up from just $300 a buildable square foot two years ago, brokers said.
''With prices approaching $2,000 a square foot or better in TriBeCa, it is encouraging the expansion of the core of the neighborhood to adjacent areas like Broadway,'' said Daniel Fasulo, a managing director at Real Capital Analytics, a research firm. ''The amount of deal-making in the neighborhood is astounding.''
By the start of winter, the first buyers will move in to 93 Worth Street, a 92-unit condominium that features a dog-washing station and a roof-deck terrace. The 18-story building has had swift demand from buyers, with just nine apartments remaining, including four penthouses that are yet to be put on the market. The average sale price is $1,700 a square foot, according to Eldad Blaustein, the chief executive of IGI USA, the building's developer.
''This is a brand-new Broadway corridor,'' said Doron Zwickel, an associate real estate broker at Core, which is marketing the building. ''Historically, this hasn't been prime TriBeCa, but it is becoming more desirable.''
One draw has actually been that the building is outside the core of the neighborhood, and not in the flood zone that saw so much damage during Hurricane Sandy last year. ''After the storm, we got a lot of interest from people close to the water who wanted to be in the neighborhood but didn't want to have the risks,'' Mr. Zwickel said.
On Leonard Street one block to the south, two buildings are rising: 350 Broadway, a 12-story former office tower, is being converted into a 66-unit condominium. Bizzi & Partners Development, which built the Setai Fifth Avenue in Midtown, began sales in July, and the building, called 101 Leonard, is more than 60 percent sold. At 346 Broadway, the Miami-based developer Don Peebles is planning a $350 million renovation to convert the building, which was used by the New York City Criminal Court, into roughly 200 condominium units and a hotel. It acquired the 13-story building in March from the City of New York for $160 million.
At Broadway and Franklin Street, the developer El Ad is planning the Franklin, a 53-unit condo complex with amenities like a children's playroom and a rooftop pool. The building has gone through a number of failed conversion plans, perhaps most notoriously in 2006, when the Dutch architect Ben van Berkel designed a 20-story apartment building, with glass elevators and a facade of black metal bands. Those plans fell apart during the recession, and El Ad eventually acquired the site.
The Franklin ''is the fastest-selling building I've ever had,'' said Richard Cantor, a principal at the brokerage firm Cantor Pecorella, which is overseeing the marketing. Since sales began in May, 48 of the 53 apartments are in contract. Originally, the units were priced at $1,350 a square foot, but they were later raised to $1,550 and then $1,650. ''Now, by the time we sell out, the prices will be closer to $1,800 a foot; we just sold the largest penthouse for $10 million, or just under $2,700 a foot,'' Mr. Cantor said.
There are also a number of small boutique buildings in the works. The Keystone Group acquired 391 Broadway, a commercial building, eight months ago and is converting it into four residential floor-through lofts with retail space on the ground floor. ''With TriBeCa the way it is, there is not enough product for all of the demand, so the neighborhood keeps being pushed eastward,'' said Daniel Martin, a managing director at Keystone Group. It hopes to complete the project by May.
At 372 Broadway, which is being renamed 6 Cortlandt Alley for the street it abuts, developers are getting approvals to build a five-unit condominium, with sales beginning in the spring. At 361 Broadway, the Japanese architect Shigeru Ban is designing 13 condominium units, including a set of glass duplex penthouses that will be affixed atop the six-story cast-iron building. The plans were approved last year, and construction is set to begin as early as next month, said Dean Maltz, the building's executive architect based in New York.
Another possible development could come at 360 Broadway, where the real estate investor Waterbridge Capital recently acquired the building for $23 million. Calls to the chief executive, Joel Schreiber, were not returned.
''I've done a number of sales on the SoHo side of Broadway, and it seems to me a very natural progression to develop the area below Canal Street,'' said Susan Wires, a broker at the brokerage firm Stribling & Associates, which is marketing 6 Cortlandt Alley with her partner, Leila Yusuf. ''So many of the buildings that are coming to this area are large-scale, but ours will be really intimate and boutique, something that is missing in the marketplace right now.''
With such a strong condominium market, the land prices for development sites have also skyrocketed. ''If you compare where prices are today from 2010, it has gone way up,'' said Nick Petkoff, the director of sales at the brokerage firm Massey Knakal Realty Services.
When Mr. Blaustein acquired 93 Worth Street in 2010, for example, he paid roughly $300 a buildable square foot. ''Now, if you are buying buildings to convert, they are costing $500 to $550 a square foot,'' he said. ''We would love to buy more buildings in the neighborhood, but the competition has become fierce.''
The demand for development sites is a key reason that the owners of 396 Broadway have put the vacant building on the market for $37 million, rather then push ahead with plans to convert it into a 50-unit rental building. ''We have approved plans for a residential conversion, and an alternative plan for a hotel,'' said Gene Kaufman, the project's architect. ''But the owners right now see that the property is a lot more valuable than it once was, and so it is reasonable that they pause and rethink it, given that the circumstances have improved for the better.''
But while there has been many residential developments, retail activity in the neighborhood remains lackluster. ''Retail hasn't happened yet, it is all very embryonic,'' said Roger E. Eulau, an executive managing director at the Lansco Corporation, a retail brokerage firm. Rents are around $100 to $150 a square foot, compared with as much as $1,000 a square foot on Broadway in SoHo, he said.
Still, ''we feel that Broadway is going to be a natural gateway that links the Fulton Street Transit hub and the World Trade Center to SoHo, it is a natural thoroughfare for retail,'' said Mr. Martin of the Keystone Group. ''We are very bullish about this neighborhood's future.''

HEADLINE: Vermont Yankee Plant to Close Next Year as the Nuclear Industry Retrenches

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD; John Schwartz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The Vermont Yankee nuclear reactor, one of the oldest nuclear plants in the country and the subject of heated battles over the decades, will close late next year, the company that owns it announced on Tuesday, less than two weeks after winning a protracted legal fight against the State of Vermont to keep it open.
The company, Entergy, said a long depression in natural gas prices had pushed the wholesale price of electricity so low that it was losing money on the reactor, which is on the Connecticut River in Vernon just north of the Massachusetts border. 
So far this year, owners have announced the retirements of five reactors, with the low price of gas being cited as a factor in all of the cases. Three of the five have substantial mechanical problems.
But Vermont Yankee and one in Wisconsin, Kewaunee, represent a more significant trend because they have no major physical needs beyond the typical requirements for continuing capital investments. Vermont Yankee did face some expenses for improvements prompted by the Fukushima Daiichi meltdowns in Japan in March 2011, but these do not appear to have been decisive.
The latest closing would leave the United States with 99 operating reactors, presuming no others are shut before the fourth quarter of next year, when Vermont Yankee is to close. Four reactors in Georgia and South Carolina are under construction, and the Tennessee Valley Authority is finishing a fifth in Tennessee. But the industry is in a period of rapid decline.
''This was an agonizing decision and an extremely tough call for us,'' said Leo Denault, Entergy's chairman and chief executive, in a statement.
The Vermont plant has 630 permanent workers and employs a large number of contractors. In a midday press conference, Peter Shumlin, Vermont's governor, said ''my heart goes out to the hardworking employees and their families'' but nonetheless said: ''This is the right decision for Vermont, and it's the right decision for Vermont's energy future.''
Mr. Shumlin said he and the governors of neighboring New Hampshire and Massachusetts, where some of the workers live, ''have all pledged to work together as a team with Entergy to ensure that those who are losing their jobs have a great economic future right here in our region.''
Entergy, based in Louisiana, had fought hard against a seven-year effort by the state to force the reactor to close in 2012 at the end of its initial 40-year operating license. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled this month, upholding a lower court decision that found states were ''pre-empted'' from regulating safety. Oral arguments in that case were made early this year, when Entergy apparently still hoped for an economic turnaround.
The Vermont Legislature had tried to shut the plant by denying Entergy a state certificate required for all power plants.
Leslie Sullivan Sachs, the project manager for the Safe and Green Campaign, a three-state coalition dedicated to shutting down Vermont Yankee and promoting alternatives to nuclear power, said after the announcement, ''it's a very good day.''
Entergy may have been motivated mostly by the desire to set a precedent favorable to a much larger nuclear complex, Indian Point, in Westchester County in New York, which the state is seeking to force to close.
Indian Point and Vermont Yankee -- along with another reactor in New York, the James A. FitzPatrick plant on Lake Ontario, and reactors in Massachusetts and Michigan -- were bought by Entergy as the utility industry restructured and the local companies that built them divested themselves to concentrate on transmission and retail delivery.
Entergy also owns the Pilgrim reactor in Plymouth, Mass., which is of similar vintage and design to Vermont Yankee. But it is about 10 percent larger so its economics are somewhat better, Bill Mohl, the president of the Entergy division that manages wholesale power sales, said in an interview.
With the price of energy relatively low, what Vermont Yankee needed to be profitable was higher payments from customers for its capacity, Mr. Mohl said. In New England, electricity is priced two ways: in kilowatt-hours, the unit familiar to homeowners, who typically buy hundreds of kilowatt-hours a month; and in megawatts, or the ability to produce. That market, too, is depressed.
Tearing down the old reactor will require many years and hundreds of millions of dollars. Using an option approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Entergy intends to seal the plant and leave it for years, while some of the radioactivity dies down and a trust fund established for its decommissioning -- now with about $582 million on hand -- grows.
James F. X. Steets, a spokesman for Entergy, said that the fund exceeded the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's minimum requirement, but that the cost of the decommissioning had not yet been established. Vermont has a pact with Texas that will allow the low-level radioactive waste from Vermont Yankee, mostly contaminated steel and concrete, to be buried in a repository in Texas on the New Mexico border.
Vermont Yankee is by far the largest generator in the state, but a variety of other power sources are available, including imports from Quebec.

HEADLINE: Horror in Syria: What Can Be Done?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Kerry Cites Clear Evidence of Chemical Weapon Use'' (front page, Aug. 27):
There are compelling reasons to intervene in Syria's civil war. But the use of chemical weapons in last week's attack near Damascus is not one of them.
If, as Secretary of State John Kerry declared, the killing of reportedly hundreds of people with toxic gas should ''shock the conscience of the world,'' why should attacks using plain old bullets and bombs -- which have killed more than 100,000 Syrians so far -- be less troubling?
Apparently, it is not the political fundamentals of the conflict but rather the spectacular specter of chemical weapons that may finally be rousing the West to action. This augurs poorly for what is to come. Shocked consciences tend to blind us to consequences. 
STEPHEN WERTHEIM New York, Aug. 27, 2013
The writer is a doctoral candidate in international history at Columbia University.
To the Editor:
The singular policy option available to President Obama is to interdict further chemical weapon attacks upon Syrians by force of arms. Mr. Obama's admonitory ''red line'' demarcation has evidently been transgressed.
The television footage of the dead and the dying compels action, not vacuous verbiage, not deliberative studies and not endless United Nations inquiries.
ROGER BRANDWEIN Scarsdale, N.Y., Aug. 27, 2013
To the Editor:
Before the United States dives into another intractable intervention, we should take a small but significant step into the shark-infested Syrian waters with a major humanitarian action:
We should develop regular and reliable contact with the field hospitals and provide large amounts of high-quality medical supplies to them and to the victims, both of the chemical attacks and the bombings, through airdrops into carefully pinpointed areas.
We should also fly in helicopters to airlift the most life-threatened victims to either a hospital ship or to the closest hospitals in countries bordering Syria. Ambulances should also be stationed at the Israeli, Lebanese and Turkish borders to transport the seriously wounded to the closest hospitals in these countries. Priority in these evacuations should be given to children.
These actions would not only save lives and demonstrate America's humanitarian concerns and its recognition of the urgent need to address them, but also serve to ''test the waters'' to determine if military intervention is necessary, possible and conducive to success.
AVIVA CANTOR New York, Aug. 27, 2013
To the Editor:
The coming American intervention in Syria telegraphed by Secretary of State John Kerry should not be in support of one faction or another. Rather, the United States' objective should be to secure and or destroy President Bashar al-Assad's chemical weapons.
Only such a clear and limited goal would command the support of the American people.
VICTOR ZONANA New York, Aug. 27, 2013
To the Editor:
This is not, nor should it be, the sole responsibility of the United States. In this age of globalization and porous economic and social borders, the time has come for the United Nations to seriously review its charter and contrive to allow its ''peacekeeping forces'' to act as first responders in a real and meaningful way.
What happens in one country now affects not only that country and neighboring states, and the reverberations are felt worldwide. It's all very well drawing a line in the sand, but if there is no coherent response on an international level and no plan in place to deliver immediate consequences, these events will continue.
The United Nations was created to find ways of avoiding and preventing situations like this. Today, it behaves more like the United States Congress, and the fact that it chooses to remain impotent in the face of very real need is a damning comment on an organization that could be doing so much more.
SUSAN A. McGREGOR North Kingstown, R.I., Aug. 27, 2013
To the Editor:
Illegal and immoral as the use of chemical weapons in the Syrian civil war may be, there is not universal agreement as to whether their use should be an automatic trigger to an outside military response. Not only are our old cold-war adversaries on the other side of the issue, but there are also reasonable voices within our own country calling for restraint.
The president must not only wrestle with those issues but also with where our most important interests lie and how best to achieve them.
Analogies to other moments in history may hold some universal truths, but the strife in Syria has its differences as well. As strong as the public statements may grow, the president should be patient in his examination of all available options before deciding that a military response is called for here.
Life-or-death decisions are not easy for any president.
BRUCE NEUMAN Sag Harbor, N.Y., Aug. 27, 2013
To the Editor:
Re ''Blasts in the Night, a Smell, and a Flood of Syrian Victims'' (front page, Aug. 27):
How many scores of innocents died horrific deaths in the Ghouta region near Damascus, victims -- or so we are assured -- of President Bashar al-Assad's chemical warheads? Who can doubt the Syrian dictator's unspeakable depravity in clinging to power? Who can doubt that he deserves to be covered in a monsoon of cruise missiles? And yet.
The Middle East is a caldron of madness. The Syrian tyrant's adversaries -- too many of them -- are as malevolent as he. If our missiles weaken him and strengthen the extremist jihadis, what have we accomplished?
We should keep our missiles in their quivers unless we have a high degree of confidence that we can take out Syria's chemical capability without sending more clouds of death over Ghouta and other such places.
BOB BRUSSACK Athens, Ga., Aug. 27, 2013
To the Editor:
In ''Responding to Syrian Atrocities''(editorial, Aug. 27), you write that if President Obama decides to use military force in Syria, he will ''have to show that he has exhausted diplomatic options.'' One such option might be a call collectively made by the United States, the European Union, members of the Arab League, the United Nations, Russia, China, Israel, Pope Francis and the Dalai Lama to all combatants in Syria for an immediate cessation of hostilities and negotiations for peace in Ankara, with Turkey as host.
The peace conference should announce at the outset amnesty for President Bashar al-Assad and his cabinet and safe passage for them out of Syria to a country that would take them in.
Let all killings in Syria cease: the massacre of more than 100,000 men, women and children is already an indelible stain on the soul of the 21st century.
K. NARAYAN KUTTY Mansfield Center, Conn., Aug. 27, 2013
To the Editor:
The problem with President Obama is that he confuses preaching with leadership. Less rhetoric, or at least more thoughtful rhetoric, particularly on complex policy matters, and a bit more hands-on leadership would help.
Deeds, not words -- however eloquent or glib, depending on one's point of view -- are required. He got himself in this fix with too much talking and too little reflecting.
Speaking loudly and carrying a small stick is a formula for disaster. To use a military parallel, we need a Grant, not a McClellan.
RON HOLDAWAY Thayne, Wyo., Aug. 27, 2013
To the Editor:
Re ''In Syria, America Loses if Either Side Wins,'' by Edward N. Luttwak (Sunday Review, Aug. 25):
A prolonged draw in Syria means a humanitarian disaster. The United Nations World Food Program is trying to feed at least four million war victims inside Syria. Another two million have fled the country and also need aid.
Agriculture has been destroyed. Food supply systems are ruined. Malnutrition has escalated. The World Food Program and Unicef need to bring in special foods to keep children from suffering lasting physical and mental damage, or worse.
The World Food Program needs about $30 million a week to sustain this relief. The United Nations food agency depends on voluntary financing from the United States and other countries. There are also other hunger emergencies taking place in Yemen, Haiti, South Sudan, Mali and other countries where United Nations food resources are needed.
Food has clearly taken its place at the top of the foreign policy plate.
A prolonged conflict will spiral the Middle East toward famine. The war has to be brought to an end. The debate must be on how we can help achieve this.
WILLIAM LAMBERS Cincinnati, Aug. 25, 2013
The writer interviewed members of the United Nations World Food Program for his book ''Ending World Hunger.''
To the Editor:
Edward N. Luttwak's essay can be summarized by the Shakespeare quotation in ''The Taming of the Shrew'': ''There's small choice in rotten apples.''

HEADLINE: Janet Yellen's Wealth

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve&#8217;s vice chairwoman, held investments in 2012 worth at least $4.8 million, including a valuable stamp collection, according to financial disclosures released Tuesday. 

 BODY:
Janet L. Yellen reported investments worth at least $4.8 million in 2012, making her one of the wealthiest members of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, according to annual financial disclosures that the Fed released Tuesday. 
All seven members of the board are millionaires, but the disclosures also show that the Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, may well be the least affluent of the group.
Ms. Yellen, a candidate to succeed Mr. Bernanke, owned stock in a small number of companies including Conoco Phillips and Pfizer, but mostly invested in broad-based equity and bond funds. Much of the money is held in retirement accounts.
Her investments, mostly held in common with her husband, George Akerlof, also include a stamp collection worth at least $15,000. The couple's investments were worth between $4.8 million and $13.2 million in 2012, according to the disclosure forms, which assign each asset to a range (such as $50,001 to $100,000) rather than providing a value. 
The total does not include the pensions the couple earned at the University of California, Berkeley, where both worked as professors, nor Ms. Yellen's pension from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, where she was president from 2004 to 2010, nor the home they own near campus.
Ms. Yellen earns a salary of $179,900 as a Fed governor. She does not earn anything extra for her position as vice chairwoman. On top of that, the couple reported income from investments of between $102,820 and $323,200. The disclosure forms do not include the salary earned by Mr. Akerlof as a senior resident scholar at the International Monetary Fund.
(The leading candidate to succeed Mr. Bernanke, Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, reported wealth between $7 million and $31 million in 2009, when he last entered public service. He likely has probably that number considerably since leaving the Obama administration in 2010.)
The format of the disclosures make it impossible to rank the Fed's governors by wealth, but Mr. Bernanke's reported holdings of $1.1 million to $2.3 million had the lowest minimum and the lowest maximum values of any governor.

HEADLINE: Morning Agenda: A Record Payout in Bias Case

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Merrill Lynch will pay $160 million to settle a racial bias lawsuit. | Two regulators are preparing enforcement actions and fines against JPMorgan Chase. | An effort to increase disclosure on executive pay may have created more murkiness. 

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch has agreed to pay $160 million to settle a racial bias lawsuit that wound through the federal courts for eight years, Patrick McGeehan reports in DealBook. The payout in the suit, which was filed on behalf of 700 black brokers who worked for Merrill, would be the largest amount ever distributed to plaintiffs in a racial discrimination suit against an American employer, Mr. McGeehan writes. Merrill, which is now owned by Bank of America, also agreed to take advice from black employees on how to improve their chances of success as brokers.
The terms of the preliminary settlement were provided by Linda D. Friedman, a Chicago lawyer who represents the brokers. A spokesman for Merrill Lynch refused to confirm the terms. The pool of money dwarfs recent payouts by other Wall Street firms, including $16 million that Morgan Stanley agreed to pay in 2008 to resolve a suit brought by black and Hispanic brokers.
"This is a somewhat heroic story because these plaintiffs just kept fighting and fighting," said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School. "This is like a triple-overtime win." 
REGULATORS PREPARE PENALTIES FOR JPMORGAN | Two regulators - the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - are preparing a series of enforcement actions and fines against JPMorgan Chase stemming from its dealings with consumers during the recession, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Ben Protess report. Under the terms of the civil orders, which may be announced as soon as next month, the bank will have to acknowledge internal flaws and dole out at least $80 million in fines, according to people briefed on the matter.
The most costly cases for JPMorgan stem from concerns that the bank duped its credit card customers into buying products pitched as a way to shield them from identity theft. The consumer bureau will levy a fine of roughly $20 million, while the comptroller's office is expected to extract about $60 million, DealBook reports. "In another set of actions, the regulators are aiming at the bank for the way it collected overdue bills from consumers, the people said. It is unclear whether those cases will yield any fines."
ON THE AGENDA | Data on pending home sales in July is out at 10 a.m. Joe Ratterman, the chief executive of BATS Global Markets, is on Bloomberg TV at 10 a.m.
RULE ON PAY DISCLOSURE COMPLICATES THE PROBLEM | The idea sounded simple: require that the pay of a company's chief executive be compared to the median salary of its employees. But "Congressional leaders, in their rage against ever-rising executive compensation and income inequality, have created more murkiness," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. "Carrying out the law may well result in costs that are just as obscene as the pay it is disclosing."
"The first problem came in how compensation is calculated," Mr. Davidoff writes. It can be difficult to calculate an executive's various types of compensation as one figure, and finding the median of "all" employees' pay can be challenging for a multinational conglomerate. "Then there is the issue of when to calculate it. The number will fluctuate from day to day. The end result is that what was thought a simple calculation is turning into an exercise that could cost some companies millions."

HEADLINE: A Record Payout in Bias Case

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Merrill Lynch will pay $160 million to settle a racial bias lawsuit. | Two regulators are preparing enforcement actions and fines against JPMorgan Chase. | An effort to increase disclosure on executive pay may have created more murkiness. 

 BODY:
Merrill Lynch has agreed to pay $160 million to settle a racial bias lawsuit that wound through the federal courts for eight years, Patrick McGeehan reports in DealBook. The payout in the suit, which was filed on behalf of 700 black brokers who worked for Merrill, would be the largest amount ever distributed to plaintiffs in a racial discrimination suit against an American employer, Mr. McGeehan writes. Merrill, which is now owned by Bank of America, also agreed to take advice from black employees on how to improve their chances of success as brokers.
The terms of the preliminary settlement were provided by Linda D. Friedman, a Chicago lawyer who represents the brokers. A spokesman for Merrill Lynch refused to confirm the terms. The pool of money dwarfs recent payouts by other Wall Street firms, including $16 million that Morgan Stanley agreed to pay in 2008 to resolve a suit brought by black and Hispanic brokers.
"This is a somewhat heroic story because these plaintiffs just kept fighting and fighting," said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at Columbia Law School. "This is like a triple-overtime win." 
REGULATORS PREPARE PENALTIES FOR JPMORGAN | Two regulators - the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau - are preparing a series of enforcement actions and fines against JPMorgan Chase stemming from its dealings with consumers during the recession, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Ben Protess report. Under the terms of the civil orders, which may be announced as soon as next month, the bank will have to acknowledge internal flaws and dole out at least $80 million in fines, according to people briefed on the matter.
The most costly cases for JPMorgan stem from concerns that the bank duped its credit card customers into buying products pitched as a way to shield them from identity theft. The consumer bureau will levy a fine of roughly $20 million, while the comptroller's office is expected to extract about $60 million, DealBook reports. "In another set of actions, the regulators are aiming at the bank for the way it collected overdue bills from consumers, the people said. It is unclear whether those cases will yield any fines."
ON THE AGENDA | Data on pending home sales in July is out at 10 a.m. Joe Ratterman, the chief executive of BATS Global Markets, is on Bloomberg TV at 10 a.m.
RULE ON PAY DISCLOSURE COMPLICATES THE PROBLEM | The idea sounded simple: require that the pay of a company's chief executive be compared to the median salary of its employees. But "Congressional leaders, in their rage against ever-rising executive compensation and income inequality, have created more murkiness," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. "Carrying out the law may well result in costs that are just as obscene as the pay it is disclosing."
"The first problem came in how compensation is calculated," Mr. Davidoff writes. It can be difficult to calculate an executive's various types of compensation as one figure, and finding the median of "all" employees' pay can be challenging for a multinational conglomerate. "Then there is the issue of when to calculate it. The number will fluctuate from day to day. The end result is that what was thought a simple calculation is turning into an exercise that could cost some companies millions."

HEADLINE: How Do You Decide When to Add New Employees?

BYLINE: YOU'RE THE BOSS EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: In the recession&#8217;s aftermath, many small-business owners are wary of hiring too fast. 

 BODY:
It can be challenging for Willan Johnson to know how many people to employ at his pool-cleaning business, VivoPools, in Los Angeles, for a number of reasons. 
First, he needs more people in the warmer months. He also has to consider where his jobs are and how long it will take his workers to drive from one job to another. Some jobs take longer than others, because vacuuming and scrubbing take more time than chemical treatments. Plus, he said, "Everyone wants their residential pool service on Friday."
Of course, like most business owners, Mr. Johnson always wants to avoid having too many people and not enough work. "Determining when and how many employees to hire is a bit tricky for our business as the demand for services varies based on account growth, seasonality, geography of homeowner addresses and customer requests," said Mr. Johnson, who started the company four years ago.
We've just published a small-business guide that talks to business owners like Mr. Johnson about how they decide when it's safe to hire. Please read the guide - and then tell us what you do: How do you decide when to bring on another employee?

The Debt Ceiling

        
Stan Collender reminds us that #cliffgate officially begins Tuesday: "There will be only nine legislative days before fiscal 2014 starts on Oct. 1. Approximately 15 calendar (but no more than 10 legislative) days later, the Treasury says the government will not have the cash it needs to pay all its bills. At that point either the federal debt ceiling will have to be raised so the government may borrow more or a technical or actual default will occur."
        
Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew says that President Obama will not negotiate over the issue. Republicans say the president and the Democrats are resisting prudent steps to restrain the growth of federal spending.

Management

        
Jason Forrest shares his experiences maintaining and monitoring his brand: "Once we established our brand and its role in and outside of our company, it became the guiding force behind all of our subsequent communications. Over the course of the year, we asked ourselves whether we were communicating and demonstrating the brand that we established. We asked if it was congruent with our purpose and everything we are trying to accomplish in the coming years. If we did things that weren't clearly aligned with our brand, we doubled back and ensured we restarted on the right path. It's all about maintenance. After all, there's no use establishing our company's purpose and brand if we don't live and breathe it every day."

HEADLINE: Updates on the 50th Anniversary of Martin Luther King's 'I Have a Dream' Speech

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Live updates on the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his iconic &#8220;I Have a Dream&#8221; speech. 

 BODY:
On the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s iconic "I Have a Dream" speech, thousands of people descended on the Lincoln Memorial on Wednesday. Joined by the former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, President Obama paid homage to Dr. King and others involved in the civil rights era. "And because they kept marching, America changed," the president said. "Because they marched, the civil rights law was passed. Because they marched, the voting rights law was signed." More coverage from the day's events.
 4:02 P.M. | Full Text of President Obama's Speech 
The full text of President Obama's speech. 
 3:44 P.M. | President Obama Pays Homage to Marchers 
As my colleague Peter Baker reported, President Obama paid homage to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Wednesday "in a celebration of a half-century of progress and a call to arms for the next generation."
"To dismiss the magnitude of this progress - to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed - that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years," Mr. Obama said as Dr. King's relatives, compatriots and admirers watched. "But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete."
He emphasized the role that so many people played 50 years ago to bring about change across America.
"Because they marched, America became more fair," Mr. Obama said. "America changed for you and me, and the entire world grew strength from that example."
He also made the case that opportunity that the challenge in the future was to make opportunity available for the many, not just a few, for "the black custodian and the white steelworker" and "the immigrant dishwasher."
"This remains our great unfinished business," he said. "We shouldn't fool ourselves. The task will not be easy."
An excerpt from his speech:
And because they kept marching, America changed. Because they marched, the civil rights law was passed. Because they marched, the voting rights law was signed. Because they marched, doors of opportunity and education swung open so their daughters and sons could finally imagine a life for themselves beyond washing somebody else's laundry or shining somebody else's shoes. (Applause.) Because they marched, city councils changed and state legislatures changed and Congress changed and, yes, eventually the White House changed. Because they marched, America became more free and more fair, not just for African-Americans but for women and Latinos, Asians and Native Americans; for Catholics, Jews and Muslims; for gays; for Americans with disabilities. 
America changed for you and for me.
Standing on the same Lincoln Memorial steps where Dr. King stood 50 years before, Mr. Obama said, "The promise of this nation will only be kept when we work together." 
By the time Mr. Obama descended the steps Wednesday afternoon, the crowd gathered on the National Mall for the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington extended the length of the Reflecting Pool, and thousands were still waiting to enter the heavily fortified area.
A steady drizzle lasted for hours as the crowd heard speeches from a mix of celebrities and political leaders on topics like jobs, health care, immigration, voting rights, same-sex marriage and, of course, equality.
Mr. Obama was surrounded by his family; the former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter; Representative John Lewis of Georgia, the last living speaker from the 1963 march; and Oprah Winfrey.

- Jon Keller (@kelleratlarge)28 Aug 13
At 3 p.m., bells rang across the country and the world to commemorate the moment that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech. 
The bell that rang at the Lincoln Memorial had been salvaged from the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., which was bombed on Sept. 15, 1963, killing four girls. The bombing, which came shortly after Dr. King's speech, was a turning point in the civil rights movement.
In Philadelphia, the Liberty Bell at Independence Hall tolled for the occasion. 
 2:53 P.M. | Bill Clinton Criticizes Supreme Court on Voting Rights 
Pres Clinton takes shot at gridlock and whacks Supreme Court on voting rights. Says it shd be as easy to vote as to buy assault weapon.
- carl hulse (@hillhulse)28 Aug 13
Former President Bill Clinton recalled watching Martin Luther King Jr. deliver his speech on television while Mr. Clinton was a 17-year-old high school student in Arkansas. 
In his remarks, Mr. Clinton emphasized the importance of voting rights and criticized the United States Supreme Court decision that struck down a section of the Voting Rights Act. 
"A great democracy does not make it harder to vote than to buy an assault weapon," Mr. Clinton declared to echoes of approval from those who came to honor Dr. King's legacy.
Mr. Clinton and former President Jimmy Carter, speaking before President Obama, each hit on a similar theme: that Dr. King would have been less than satisfied with the state of affairs in America today.
"I think we all know how Dr. King would have reacted," Mr. Carter said, to the Supreme Court's decision to strike down a central portion of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, to high rates of unemployment for black teenagers, and to "our country being awash in guns."
Mr. Clinton lamented political gridlock, yet spoke of progress.
"Yes, there remain racial inequalities in employment, income, health," he said. "But we don't face beatings, lynchings, shootings for our political beliefs anymore. And I would respectfully suggest Martin Luther King did not live and die to hear his heirs whine about political gridlock."
 Correction: An earlier version of this update misspelled Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s surname.

 2:48 P.M. | Jesse Jackson: Progress Has Been Made; Problems Remain 
The Rev. Jesse Jackson said that President Obama should not be compared to Dr. King, but to other presidents.
"He is in the Lincoln, Roosevelt, Johnson lineage," Mr. Jackson said.
He added that progress had been made since 1963, but that problems remained. "What we need today is a renewed commitment to a constitutional right to vote, student debt forgiveness and job opportunities," he said.
Today's challenges, he said, owe to race and class.
"It is both," he said, noting the high rates of black unemployment and incarceration. "Race is still an issue."
Mr. Jackson also said too much attention was paid today to Dr. King's dream of racial equality, and not enough to the problems he fought near the end of his life: poverty and militarism.
"When we just focus on the dream, we think about the high point of ecstasy he left us down here," Mr. Jackson said, lowering his open hand to the ground.

Oprah was 9 yrs when Dr. King delivered his historic address. She wanted to come then, glad she made it here today. http://t.co/t3xO8QAvD2
- Kasim Reed (@KasimReed)28 Aug 13
Kasim Reed, the mayor of Atlanta, shared this photo on Twitter of Oprah Winfrey, who received one of the loudest ovations of the afternoon when she spoke to the crowd.
"I remember when I was 9 years old, and I asked my mama, 'Can I go to the march?' " Ms. Winfrey said, standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, looking out as a crowd filled the National Mall under a spitting rain. "It took me 50 years, but I'm here."
Ms. Winfrey was among a pantheon of speakers - civil rights leaders, Hollywood stars, politicians, union activists and members of the clergy - who addressed the crowd briefly before President Obama and the former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter, who arrived at the memorial shortly after 2 p.m. and will speak later in the afternoon.
"Let freedom ring," she said several times, noting that at 3 this afternoon, "we as a nation will reaffirm" our commitment to Dr. King's ideals by ringing bells across the country.
She said Dr. King had challenged people to see that they are more alike than different.
Then Ms. Winfrey asked those in the crowd to reflect on what they had accomplished and on what they still had to do. Pointing out that Dr. King was just 34 when he delivered his "I Have a Dream" speech, she said he pushed an entire country to "wake up."
As the bells toll on Wednesday, Ms. Winfrey said, we should reflect on those who stood up for freedom and ask ourselves how the dream will live on.

- Ashley Southall (@assouthall)28 Aug 13
Many people who attended the March on Washington 50 years ago returned on Wednesday.
The Times spoke to Edith Lee Payne, 62, who attended the march with her mother. She returned with her granddaughters to show them that future progress "is going to take more than assembly," she said. 
William Andrew Allison, 92, has kept his sign from that day in a closet for the last half-century. "We March for Effective Civil Rights Laws Now!" it reads.
"When I came down for the march, they gave me the sign," he said.
Mr. Allison, of Washington, took the placard out of storage on Wednesday and put it next to him as he sat on a bench between the White House and the National Mall.
A railway mail worker in 1963, Mr. Allison said he came home from New York overnight on the morning of the march, took a nap and washed up.
"I was excited," he said. "I think everybody was excited, very excited."
Mr. Allison said he had wanted to find his sign and return with it to the Mall on Wednesday.
"I thought I'd come back; it had been 50 years," he said.
Mr. Allison - wearing a red baseball hat bearing the letters of the historically black fraternity Kappa Alpha Psi - added he had enlisted in the Navy on Dec. 18, 1941, just days after the attack on Pearl Harbor.
"It was a segregated Navy," he said.

 1:30 P.M. | Bells Scheduled to Ring Around the World at 3 P.M. 
Among the celebrities joining President Obama and the former presidents Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter for the "Let Freedom Ring" commemoration on Wednesday are Oprah Winfrey, Jamie Foxx and Forest Whitaker. Representative John Lewis and the Rev. Al Sharpton Jr. are also among the speakers. 
Here is a live video feed.
At 3 p.m., a half-century to the minute after Dr. King delivered his historic address, his family has asked for people around the country and the world to participate in a bell-ringing event. "My father concluded his great speech with a call to 'let freedom ring,' and that is a challenge we will meet with a magnificent display of brotherhood and sisterhood in symbolic bell-ringing at places of worship, schools and other venues where bells are available from coast to coast and continent to continent," said Bernice A. King, Dr. King's daughter and chief executive of the Martin Luther King Center.

One of the examples she pointed to is NPR's new Twitter account @Todayin1963, which is posting live updates as if it were Aug. 28, 1963. For example, the account notes that the actors Marlon Brando and Paul Newman were among those at the march, along with Roy Wilkins of the N.A.A.C.P.

 10:24 A.M. | King Improvised His Famous Words, 'I Have a Dream' 
 [Video: On Aug. 28, 1963, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King delivered one of the most famous speeches in American history, "I Have a Dream" via YouTube. Watch on YouTube.]
As the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial before the more than 250,000 people attending the March on Washington, his prepared remarks did not include what would become his most famous words, "I have a dream."
My colleague Michiko Kakutani describes how the singer Mahalia Jackson shouted to Dr. King from the speaker's stand to include it, recalling the passage from past speeches.
Dr. King was about halfway through his prepared speech when Mahalia Jackson - who earlier that day had delivered a stirring rendition of the spiritual "I Been 'Buked and I Been Scorned" - shouted out to him from the speakers' stand: "Tell 'em about the 'Dream,' Martin, tell 'em about the 'Dream'!" She was referring to a riff he had delivered on earlier occasions, and Dr. King pushed the text of his remarks to the side and began an extraordinary improvisation on the dream theme that would become one of the most recognizable refrains in the world.
With his improvised riff, Dr. King took a leap into history, jumping from prose to poetry, from the podium to the pulpit. His voice arced into an emotional crescendo as he turned from a sobering assessment of current social injustices to a radiant vision of hope - of what America could be. "I have a dream," he declared, "my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today!"
Drew Hansen, a member of the Washington State House of Representatives and the author of "The Dream: Martin Luther King Jr. and the Speech That Inspired a Nation," wrote in The Times that Dr. King had been fine-tuning his speech since earlier that year, and had mentioned his dream in previous remarks delivered in Birmingham, Ala., and Detroit. 
But, Mr. Hansen wrote, Dr. King worried he wouldn't have time to include the dream language. 
Then, at Ms. Jackson's urging, he did. 
As he later explained in an interview, "All of a sudden this thing came to me that I have used - I'd used many times before, that thing about 'I have a dream' - and I just felt that I wanted to use it here." He said, "I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream." And he was off, delivering some of the most beloved lines in American history, a speech that he never intended to give and that some of the other civil rights leaders believed no one but the marchers would ever remember.

HEADLINE: Can Republicans Paint the White House Red?

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: What has to happen for the party to retake the presidency, not to mention the Senate. 

 BODY:
Democrats may dream of 16 years of dominance, but on Nov. 8, 2016, it is entirely possible that Americans will elect a Republican president. It is even possible, although less likely, that Republicans will be in full control of the federal government: the White House, the Senate, the House of Representatives and the Supreme Court.
A dominant theme in contemporary political commentary on the left, the right and the center is that the Republican Party faces a grave crisis of both demographics and ideology. But despite the cacophony of fault finding, caution is in order before we declare the Republican Party down for the count. 
To explore the possibility of a Republican revival in 2016, I spoke with a number of Republican strategists, including Stuart Stevens, who ran the Romney campaign in 2012; Patrick Ruffini, president of Engage, a digital consulting company; and Bill McInturff, founder of Public Opinion Strategies. 
Stevens is a critic of the doom-and-gloom approach. He argues that a successful 2016 Republican presidential scenario can be credibly pieced together. Here are some of the hypotheticals that might lead to victory.

One, Hillary Clinton chooses not to run or, as was the case in 2008, falls flat in the primaries and caucuses. This would leave Democrats with second-tier candidates, none of whom can inspire the overall turnout or the specific margins enjoyed by President Obama.
Two, public discontent with Obamacare grows. Young voters, a key to recent Democratic victories, bristle over the requirement to buy insurance or pay a fine. Corporate plans cut spousal coverage. Businesses replace full-time workers with part-timers, ineligible for benefits. Health insurance premiums continue to rise faster than inflation. The discontent with the Affordable Care Act on the part of the three major unions - the Teamsters, United Food and Commercial Workers and Unite-Here - spreads throughout the labor movement. Glitches in rolling out the massive new health care program increase public opposition (the regulations governing the hiring of health care "navigators" to help consumers enroll total an estimated 13,900 words in the Federal Register). Increasing numbers of people cannot keep either their current doctor or their health care plan.
Three, the stock market and corporate profits rise, but employment continues to lag; more people drop out of the work force; the job market continues to bifurcate, with work at the high and low ends, but less and less in the middle.
Four, the Republican primary electorate does not nominate Ted Cruz of Texas or Rand Paul of Kentucky and instead picks Jeb Bush or another mainstream nominee.
Ruffini puts the case for 50-50 odds in 2016 in terms of his view that Hillary Clinton is the likely nominee, noting that she carries substantial baggage. "Clinton's currently favorable political position," Ruffini wrote me, 
is a function of the aftermath of the 2008 campaign, where she gained in popularity amongst Republicans as a Democratic foil to Obama, and stayed above the partisan fray as secretary of state. In 2016, that dynamic will no longer apply.
In addition, he said, 
No one wants to say that Hillary Clinton is too old to be president; she is not. But there is a demonstrable bias in recent presidential elections towards a younger candidate being able to successfully contrast stylistically against an older one. Especially if the public mood pivots back towards change in 2016, this is something Clinton will need to navigate, as it seems likely right now that the Republican candidate will personify a generational shift in the electorate. Finally, it should be remembered that we saw how Clinton performed on the campaign trail in 2008 and the results weren't good.
Ruffini's bottom line:
Clinton is a formidable candidate who can rely on historic levels of support among women and can raise hundreds of millions of dollars online even before the general election. The celebrity factor will propel her. But she won't be able to defy gravity forever.
It's relatively easy to draw up a counter-scenario in which Republican prospects in 2016 are dim. Let's say:

        
Conservative Republicans in the House and Senate force a government shutdown inflicting damage on the economy.
        
The fight for the nomination forces all Republican candidates, including those from the mainstream, to shift to the right, undermining their general election prospects;
        
Republican primary voters go over the edge and nominate Cruz or Paul.
        
Hillary Clinton runs unopposed for the nomination, raises $1 billion or more before the conventions, while Republicans battle one another with the winner broke in August 2016.
Just as important, the Electoral College, which throughout the years of Republican ascendancy from the late '60s into the early '90s tilted to the right, now leans to the left. This map of the United States, "The Big Blue Wall," was put together by the Republican polling firm Public Opinion Strategies:
The Republican Party's difficulties have prompted some sympathetic analysts to call for a reversal of trickle-down economic policies. Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, and Peter Wehner of the Ethics and Public Policy Centerargue that Republicans should become 
visible and persistent critics of corporate welfare: the vast network of subsidies and tax breaks extended by Democratic and Republican administrations alike to wealthy and well-connected corporations.
Even Karl Rove, the chief political adviser to an administration that passed two tax cuts favoring the affluent, has caught the populist bug, arguing "there is too much corporate welfare and there are too many breaks that benefit the big guys and the people who've already got it." With no evident embarrassment, Rove told an Aspen Institute conference on the future of the Republican Party:
So we got a tax system that benefits the big guy over the little guy and we need to reform it and we got a government with way too much benefits that flow to the people who've got the money that keeps us from providing the resources necessary to the people who don't have money and also keeps us all paying too much in taxes, because they're running up too much of debt, because most of that corporate welfare, if not all of it, is being paid for by borrowed money we don't have.
David Leege, an emeritus professor of political science at the University of Notre Dame, believes Republicans have a good shot in 2016 because their disparate and often conflicting factions "will unite around an even more elemental fear - threats to the preservation of white male rule." Leege argues in an e-mail to The Times:
2016 could look good for Reps. They are the party of fresh faces. Dems are the party of old faces. Reps have taken advantage of Citizens United and will (illegally) do as good a job of coordinating almost limitless gifts between PACs and the candidate's campaign organization, as the Dems did in 2012 with "limited" funds.
Steve Ansolabehere, a political scientist at Harvard, is even more bullish on Republican prospects: 
I think they have a better than 50-50 shot at the presidency. It is very hard for a party to win the presidency three times in a row - since WW II, only the run of Reagan-Bush. There are a lot of divisions in the G.O.P., but there is no shortage of respectable candidates.
The post-World War II historical record strongly favors a Republican victory in 2016, according to David Mayhew, a political scientist at Yale. He pointed out that in five of the six "open" elections since World War II (open meaning without an incumbent candidate), the candidate representing the party holding the White House lost. In 2016, the Democratic nominee will fit that definition.
Both Mayhew and Arthur Lupia, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, contend that Republican power brokers should be able to force enough of a change in the direction of the party to be competitive. Lupia wrote in an e-mail responding to a Times inquiry asking him to assess the competitive strength of the parties:
Establishment Republicans have room to extend their base and their appeal. The incremental changes that we are seeing on issues such as immigration, same-sex marriage and climate change set the stage for a person with conservative bona fides to draw support from the ideological center of the U.S. population. Slight changes in G.O.P. primary rules and more strategic use of money by establishment Republican money people will give centrists more advantages than they had in 2008 and 2012.
Along parallel lines, Mayhew wrote:
Generally speaking, out-parties adapt. They take advantage of various party-in-office erosions, they adjust to changing demographics, and they play a good game in candidate choice and issue positioning.
The issues at play in presidential campaigns are often different from those in House and Senate races. Control of the Senate could turn out to be a bigger hurdle for the Republican Party than winning the White House. Republicans have a decent chance of taking control next year, but even if they do, the party will have a tough time retaining control in 2016.
The view among nonpartisan election experts on the 2014 Senate races is generally similar. Charlie Cook described the odds as
a little less than 50-50 for G.O.P. takeover. Don't know if you have seen our Senate math worksheet. Republicans have a very narrow but not uphill path to a majority. They have to almost run the table, but the states aren't tough ones.
Stuart Rothenberg, editor and publisher of The Rothenberg Political Report, told me that he expects Republicans to pick up from three to six seats. "As you know, the Rs need to net six seats to take the Senate. So we characterize the Senate as 'in play.'"
Larry Sabato, a professor of political science at the University of Virginia, wrote in an e-mailed response to a Times inquiry:
I look at it this way. Heavy odds that Republicans will pick up seats, net, in 2014. Right now, it looks like +3 or +4. They need +6 to gain control. So Democrats are early slight favorites to retain control of the Senate. All the Republicans need, though, is a medium-sized wave to take 6. They already probably have W.V., S.D., and Mont. - currently all D seats with vacating incumbents. It's 50-50 in Ark. for Sen. Mark Pryor (D) vs. Rep. Tom Cotton (R). Sens. Mary Landrieu (D-La.) and Mark Begich (D-Ark.) are slight favorites to hold their seats - but a medium wave could unseat them. That's potentially +6 for the G.O.P.
Cook, Rothenberg and Sabato are looking at the 2014 Senate contests. In 2016, however, the advantage in Senate elections will shift back to the Democrats. Of the 34 Senators up for election, 24 are Republicans, including those holding seats in highly competitive states like New Hampshire, Iowa, Wisconsin, Ohio, Illinois and Pennsylvania. The only 2016 Democratic seats in toss-up states are in Nevada and Colorado.
The ingredient missing so far in this discussion of the future of the Republican Party is the American business community. The Republican Party has been the political home of corporate America for generations.
At the moment, the Tea Party faction has become a major problem for business interests on at least three fronts. First, by blocking immigration reform, a top priority of the business lobby. Second, by calling for rejection of legislation raising the debt ceiling, the Tea Party promotes economic uncertainty, and uncertainty is itself anathema to commercial interests. Third, the radicalism of the Tea Party threatens the viability of the Republican Party, the political arm of business.
The future of the Republican Party will in large part be determined by the outcome of the internal struggle between the Tea Party faction and the pro-business establishment wing. Over the long haul, this is not a fight between equals. Prospects favor a revived pro-business, anti-regulatory Republican Party that purposefully narrowcasts - that is, carefully restricts to a select audience - its focus on divisive social and cultural issues, just as the Democratic Party, which had lost three presidential elections in a row, lowered its liberal profile in the 1990s. The compelling mandate for a national political party in the United States is not to serve as ideological advocate, but to win.
An earlier version of this column misstated the given name of a former speechwriter for George W. Bush; he is Michael, not Mark, Gerson.

HEADLINE: Argentine Technology Firm Plans I.P.O. on N.Y.S.E.

BYLINE: VINOD SREEHARSHA


HIGHLIGHT: Globant, an Argentine software and information technology services company, has filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange, in a move to broaden its reach. 

 BODY:
SÃO PAULO, Brazil - Globant, an Argentine software and information technology services company, has filed to go public on the New York Stock Exchange, in a move to broaden its reach. 
In a filing late Tuesday night with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the firm said it sought to raise $86.25 million, although that amount is just a placeholder for registration purposes. The lead underwriters listed are JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, William Blair and Loyal3 Securities.
The company's investors include the New York-based private equity fund Riverwood Capital, FTVentures, the British advertising giant WPP and Endeavor Global, a New York-based nonprofit organization that seeks to foster entrepreneurship in developing countries.
Globant would be the first technology company from Argentina to be listed on the N.Y.S.E., according to a spokeswoman at the exchange. The Big Board has 80 companies from Latin America listed, 14 from Argentina. 
Globant, though now incorporated in Luxembourg, was founded in 2003 in Buenos Aires, where it maintains its principal operating subsidiary. More than 2,200 of its 2,867 employees in Argentina, according to the filing. 
The four founders, who studied engineering at Argentine public universities, initially formed the company to tap into the lucrative offshoring sector that India was dominating at the time. Argentina's economy had collapsed in 2001 in the world's largest sovereign default, and a resulting sharp devaluation in 2002 made the country competitive and stimulated exports. 
The company has focused on developing software for the gaming, mobile and cloud computing sectors, and has tried to blend the approach of an advertising agency, one of Argentina's strengths, with computer programming.
Clients include Google, LinkedIn, Orbitz and Coca-Cola. North American clients accounted for 82.1 percent of its revenue in the first half of this year. In that period, it had $71.7 million in revenue, up from $56.9 million during the first half of 2012. 
In the first half of 2013, Globant posted a net profit of $8.0 million, recovering from a loss of $5.1 million
in the same period last year. 
Risks detailed in the filing include an increased employee attrition rate, as well as Argentina's deteriorating macroeconomic picture. 
Globant's founders have challenged the old way of doing business in the country, where family wealth and political connections often dictated who started companies. 
They have also done something atypical in Argentina - acquired smaller companies as part of their business growth plans. During the 1990s, when the Argentine peso was pegged to the dollar, companies often sold themselves to foreigners, rather than leverage the currency advantage and expand throughout Latin America.
Globant's founders have sought to do the opposite. In a 2008 New York Times article, Alejandro Mashad, then managing director of Endeavor Argentina, said that, "Globant's four founders could sell their company today and each have a private jet, but they want to build a company in Argentina."

HEADLINE: The Influence of Remaking The Racial Composition of a Sport

BYLINE: By HARVEY ARATON

 BODY:
Maybe Venus Williams has been trying to tell us something with her braided purple hair this week, 16 years after she first appeared on the Arthur Ashe Stadium court with colorful beads flowing and a fascinated world watching. Could she be subliminally tying a ribbon around her storied tennis career?
''I've had a tough set of circumstances to work through this year, especially this year, last year and the year before,'' she said, combining a smile with a sigh. 
The years have flown by like the blur her forehand can still be when she has enough energy to crank it up. But Williams, 33, has struggled with an autoimmune disease that saps her strength and a chronic back injury that compels us to approach her every United States Open match as if it could be her last.
She went out of this year's tournament after missing an easy volley at 5-5 in a third-set tiebreaker and losing a 3-hour, 2-minute second-round match to Jie Zheng of China, 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (5), on Wednesday night in the Louis Armstrong Stadium. She gave it the good fight, but early exits have become the norm. For now, possibly forever, Williams's best chance of getting back on Ashe may be with her sister, Serena, in the doubles draw.
Instead of dwelling on what comes next, it would seem timely to take a contextual look back to when she first showed herself in New York -- and was just what Arthur Ashe would have ordered on the day the stadium named for him opened for business.
PUB-DATE: August 25, 1997.
But this was before Serena bounded onto the Grand Slam scene and when Venus alone was heralded as tennis's untapped resource, its socio-economic game-changer.
Her mother, Oracene, said that day that her daughter was not overly thrilled with the prospect of being cast as the great urban athlete crashing the coveted country club. Venus, she added, had even called Althea Gibson to ask for advice on how to avoid the inevitable onslaught of clichés.
''She's going to have to handle it,'' Oracene said, ''because that's the way it's going to be.''
That is how it has been as Venus -- and Serena in her take-no-prisoners-entitled-kid-sister way -- came to be the reflection of women's tennis for a decade and a half. In the process, it has become increasingly clear that they have helped to remake the racial composition of their sport at home in the way it was once hoped Tiger Woods would for golf.
These days, when people think about the future after the still-dominant Serena, it is typically a woman of color who is mentioned first. The talk is about Sloane Stephens, 20, and ranked No. 15; and Madison Keys, who lost in the first round but may have the most potential of all because of her (5 feet 11 inches) size and serve. And it will now be about Victoria Duval, a 17-year-old Haitian-American, who on Tuesday sent home the 2011 champion, Samantha Stosur.
Another African-American, 18-year-old Sachia Vickery, won her first match on Tuesday and later said she took up tennis after watching the Williams sisters when she was 5.
Preparing to step on a practice court on Wednesday morning, 17-year-old Taylor Townsend -- who won the Australian Open junior girls' title and was a finalist at Wimbledon -- said she, too, had grown up on Venus and Serena:
''It was great to see African-American people in the sport, especially when you found out that there was at one point only Arthur Ashe and Althea Gibson,'' said Townsend, a lefty who was treated last year for a severe iron deficiency and is playing doubles this week. ''I've been looking up to them for so long, and now the best thing is that they are still here so a young player like me can learn from them.''
It's only fair warning that Serena may not always be in the giving mood -- witness her middle school feuding after Stephens beat her this year at the Australian Open. Stephens reported that Serena stopped following her on Twitter.
That's Serena, who, at 31, is competing with the sport's all-timers now as much as she is with contemporary opponents. Venus is only 16 months older but has become tennis's grande dame. She would feel even older if she'd heard Townsend do the quick math when told that Venus had played the day Ashe opened.
''I was, like, 1,'' Townsend said.
She did recall watching Venus play Serena on television in one of those made-for-Williams Saturday night finals, in 2001 or 2002 -- ''the greatest match I ever watched.''
Of course it was. It was a spectacle that convinced her -- a black girl in Atlanta -- that tennis was a potential career choice.
Asked about her historical role, Venus said, ''It makes me motivated to do more and also makes me happy that, you know, a whole new set of people and demographics all over the world are being introduced to this game.''
Given a chance, she didn't go much further with the theme. It's a complicated subject, just as it was in 1997. Tennis remains a sport that demands daunting financial investment, and Richard Williams's home schooling of his daughters remains an anomalous story for the ages.
When Taylor Townsend and the others first tuned in, what they saw was the height of an amazing sisters' rivalry that would later become one-sided as Serena surged and Venus's Grand Slam trophy count stopped at seven. But the measure of Venus's career must also include the young girls whose childhood visions of her no doubt compare to how she recalled Ashe -- whom she had met once -- on that unforgettable day in 1997.
''Tall, graceful,'' she said. Right to the end.

HEADLINE: A Deal in Nashville

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The musicians of the Nashville Symphony -- which had been riding a wave of successes before the recession and a destructive 2010 flood imperiled their financial future -- ratified a new one-year contract this week that will cut their pay by 15 percent. 
The agreement paves the way for the symphony's new season to begin on schedule on Sept. 5 with ''Russian Spectacular,'' a night of Mussorgsky, Prokofiev and Shostakovich. The symphony's concert hall, the Schermerhorn Symphony Center, which opened in 2006, was saved from the auction block earlier this summer when one of the symphony's biggest patrons, Martha Ingram, stepped forward to stave off foreclosure.
The orchestra said that the cuts the musicians agreed to were similar to cuts that the administrative staff had taken. The symphony's president and chief executive officer, Alan D. Valentine, praised the musicians for sharing in the sacrifice, saying in a statement that the new contract ''will allow us to continue offering the same high level of programming for our audiences.''
Laura Ross, a violinist and union steward, said in a statement that ''as challenging as this agreement will be for many of our musicians, it was ratified because we believe our role in this community is important.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Markets Sag in Asia, Reflecting Concern About the U.S. Fed and Syria

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The turmoil in Asia's emerging economies intensified on Wednesday as potential military action in Syria fanned market anxiety and stoked oil prices.
Asian markets have been under pressure for weeks, over fears that the United States Federal Reserve will start tempering its stimulus effort. Now, investors are worried that rising oil prices could further undermine growth in the region.
With the White House contemplating a ''limited'' attack on Syria, the price of benchmark crude oil has jumped from about $107 a barrel at the start of this week to more than $112. The price is currently near $110. 
Costlier oil will add to many Asian economies' woes by increasing import bills for companies and countries. It also threatens to fuel inflation, complicating the job of policy makers as they look to bolster growth.
India, which imports much of the oil it needs, is especially vulnerable. On Wednesday, the value of the Indian rupee fell nearly 4 percent, its steepest daily decline in years.
The slow progress on reforms in many Asian economies is causing many investors to look for better opportunities elsewhere, especially given the gradual pickup in the United States and Europe, said Andrew Sullivan, the director of sales trading at Kim Eng Securities in Hong Kong.
''A lot of cash flowed into emerging markets in the last few years as investors searched for yield,'' Mr. Sullivan said. Now that Western economies are showing signs of turning around, he said, these flows have been reversing. Investors ''are seeking the safety of returning their cash to nearer home,'' he said. ''It is difficult to see that changing anytime soon.''
The performance of Asian markets on Wednesday highlighted the problems. Stock markets in Japan and Hong Kong both fell more than 1.5 percent. The benchmark index in the Philippines, one of the best performers in the world in 2012, sagged 3 percent.
In Thailand, the main index dropped 1.4 percent, taking its decline since late May to more than 20 percent, while the baht fell to 32.24 per United States dollar, its weakest level since March 2010. Those falls came despite soothing comments from the Thai central bank's deputy governor, Pongpen Ruengvirayudh, who said on Tuesday that the bank had ''enough reserves at the moment to cover outflows and maintain economic growth including imports,'' Reuters reported.
In Indonesia, the rupiah fell to 10,930 per dollar, its weakest level since April 2009. Investors there are awaiting a central bank policy meeting, hastily called for Thursday, amid widespread speculation that the bank may move to raise interest rates to prop up the currency.
Policy makers in Indonesia and other emerging markets are in a tough situation. While higher interest rates might help attract renewed capital inflows, they would also raise finance costs for companies and risk stifling growth, Mr. Sullivan said. ''It's a very difficult situation -- there are no easy answers to this.''
In India, the recent turmoil follows years of nervousness about slowing growth and political gridlock ahead of elections next year. A persistent current-account deficit also means that the outflows from India have been especially pronounced in recent months.
As a result, the rupee has been weakening for more than two years, with especially significant moves since the Federal Reserve signaled in May that it would soon scale back its support of the American economy. On Wednesday, the rupee hit 68.77 per dollar, compared with around 55 at the beginning of the year. The rupee's weakness and higher oil prices are sharply increasing its import bills.
Many analysts and policy makers have stressed that the recent volatility does not portend another crisis of the sort that shook Asia in 1997 and 1998. Central banks' foreign exchange reserves are higher than they were back then. At the same time, more Asian debt is now in local currencies, rather than in dollars, meaning that weaker local currencies do not bring a painful increase in debt-servicing costs.
''The road may be rocky in the near term, particularly for the largest-deficit countries -- India and Indonesia -- but we don't think this is the Asian crisis all over again,'' Paul Gruenwald, Standard & Poor's chief economist for the Asia-Pacific region, said in a report on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Deficit Talks Resuming, But Few Sound Hopeful

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As tensions mount and expectations slip lower for any bipartisan consensus on a long-term deficit-reduction plan, a group of Republican senators will resume talks on Thursday with senior presidential advisers at the White House after a lapse that has lasted weeks.
The two sides had said they would meet during the August recess, but the gathering will be the first in that time and is intended to take stock before Congress reconvenes in September. Neither side expressed optimism in interviews, with talks snagged on the same issues that killed past bipartisan efforts: Republicans' demands for deeper Medicare cuts and President Obama's insistence that they, in return, agree to higher taxes on the wealthy and some corporations. 
The apparent lack of progress after months of intermittent meetings suggests that the effort could soon be sidelined, if not ended, as the president and Congress turn to the more pressing work of negotiating measures to finance the government and increase the nation's borrowing limit before October deadlines. Without the spending measures, the government would shut down on Oct. 1; without a higher debt limit, the nation would be unable to pay bills after mid-October and would risk another financial crisis.
The goal when the bipartisan meetings began last winter, with Mr. Obama inviting Republicans to dinner after his second inauguration, was to agree on a multiyear fiscal deal before the fall that could ease efforts to pass annual spending bills and increase the debt limit. Now it is probably too late.
Even so, the discussion with the group of senators ''is the only game in town right now,'' said an administration official, who declined to be identified in speaking about the delicate talks. ''I don't know that they will be the final deciders at the end of the day. It might have to be a group that rises out of the House,'' where Republicans have a majority.
The group includes eight Republicans who generally have not been central to the budget debates of the past three years, and are not members of either the Senate leadership or the key committees for spending and taxes. Mr. Obama turned to them, and others, after Republican leaders -- Speaker John A. Boehner in the House and the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, who is facing a re-election fight in Kentucky -- made clear that after three years of budget battles, dead ends and partial compromises, they were finished negotiating with the president.
The Republicans now engaged with the White House include Senators Johnny Isakson of Georgia, Bob Corker of Tennessee, John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Dan Coats of Indiana.
Initially, optimists on both sides suggested that the group would bring a fresh approach, as would two newcomers on Mr. Obama's side -- his chief of staff for the second term, Denis R. McDonough, and new budget director, Sylvia Mathews Burwell. But the Republican participants' lack of institutional clout or following in the Senate have proved a handicap, and they have not proposed their own deficit-reduction outline in response to the one Mr. Obama put forward in April.
Hanging over the talks is the knowledge that any agreement is likely to hit a wall in the Republican-controlled House, where the majority is determined not to compromise with Mr. Obama and where the party's leaders have been unable to pass even their own fiscal measures over the past year.
The White House meeting will be held three days after Mr. Boehner told Idaho Republicans at a fund-raiser in Boise that ''we're going to have a whale of a fight'' over the debt limit.
Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew informed Congress this week that without that increase by mid-October, the nation might be unable to pay existing obligations, including Social Security benefits, troops' pay and creditors' interest payments -- ultimately risking default.
''I wish I could tell you it was going to be pretty and polite, and it would all be finished a month before we'd ever get to the debt ceiling,'' Mr. Boehner said in Idaho. ''Sorry -- it just doesn't work that way.''

HEADLINE: Contracts to Purchase Homes Dropped Slightly in July

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Fewer people signed contracts to buy American homes in July, but the level stayed close to a six-and-a-half-year high. The modest decline suggests that higher mortgage rates have yet to slow sales sharply. 
The National Association of Realtors said its seasonally adjusted index for pending home sales declined 1.3 percent, to 109.5 in July. That is close to May's reading of 111.3, which was the highest since December 2006.
The small decline suggests that sales of previously owned homes should remain healthy in the coming months. There is generally a one- to two-month lag between a signed contract and a completed sale.
Final sales jumped to an annual pace of 5.4 million in July, the highest in three and a half years, the group said last week. Such a pace is consistent with a healthy housing market.
Higher mortgage rates appeared to have had a bigger impact on new-home sales, which plummeted last month. That raised fears that rate increases were restraining the housing recovery.
But many economists note that home prices and mortgage rates remain low by historical standards. Consistent job gains and rising consumer confidence may also support sales in the coming months.
''Higher mortgage rates are clearly negative for housing, but other key drivers -- including the labor market, confidence and expectations for prices and interest rates -- still point to improvement,'' Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics, said in a note to clients.
The average rate on a 30-year mortgage reached 4.58 percent last week, the highest level in two years and up from 3.35 percent in early May. Still, that is below the average since 1985 of about 7 percent, according to Bankrate.com.
Mortgage rates began to rise after the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, signaled that the Fed might reduce its bond purchases later this year. The purchases have helped keep borrowing costs low.
Rising home prices and more construction have bolstered economic growth and created more jobs. The housing recovery has provided crucial support to the economy when other drivers, like manufacturing, have struggled.
Gains in home prices may be starting to level off, however. Prices jumped 12.1 percent in June from a year earlier, according to the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index released on Tuesday. That is slightly slower than May's 12.2 percent year-over-year gain. But price increases slowed in June from May in 14 of the 20 cities tracked by the index.
The stabilization in prices is not necessarily a bad thing, economists said, because it could keep homes affordable and help prevent a bubble from developing in the housing market.

HEADLINE: U.S. Plan Eases Rules for Mortgage Lenders

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Six federal regulatory agencies released a reworked proposal on Wednesday that would require lenders to maintain a stake in the loans they bundle and sell as securities, part of efforts to limit the type of underwriting practices that fed the housing bubble. 
But the proposal also expanded the range of mortgages that would be exempt from the requirement.
The new rules, the latest version of a 2011 proposal, were required under the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010. Mortgages to borrowers who do not have to spend big chunks of their monthly income repaying the debt will be exempt from the requirement.
The regulators' plan would exempt more loans than earlier proposals by eliminating a requirement that so-called qualified residential mortgages include a large down payment.
Housing industry and consumer groups have lobbied for more than two years against that requirement, which they said would harm the housing market recovery.
''Our goal as regulators is to provide clear rules that allow for robust markets that meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers in a safe and sound manner,'' said Paul M. Nash, a senior official at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. ''I believe the rule, as reproposed today, helps accomplish just that.''
The new rules are aimed at preventing banks from writing risky loans with impunity.
In the years leading up to the financial crisis, banks used shoddy underwriting standards under the assumption that they could sell loans to investors and avoid harm if the borrowers defaulted.
The Dodd-Frank law called for lenders and bond issuers to hold 5 percent of those loans on their books, giving them more incentive to make better loans.
Regulators originally said that banks and bond issuers would have to hold part of the securitized loans on their books for all loans except mortgages that included a 20 percent down payment.
After criticism from housing and consumer groups, regulators decided to drop the down payment requirement.
Instead, they said on Wednesday that mortgages that met a minimum standard already adopted by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau would be exempt.
The agencies will seek public comment for 60 days before holding a final vote on the new rule.

HEADLINE: Russia Leans on Its Neighbors

BYLINE: By STEPHEN BLANK

 BODY:
You may have missed it, but on Aug. 14 Russia fired an economic shot across the bow of Ukraine. On that day, Russia's customs office ordered intensive checks on all Ukrainian goods entering Russia, effectively imposing a de facto ban. This could have ended up costing Ukraine as much as $2.5 billion in lost trade by the end of the year.
The action appeared to catch Ukraine by surprise. No official reason was given for it, but then Moscow rarely gives reasons for imposing sanctions on other states. 
After some undisclosed discussions between Russia and Ukraine -- and a European Union reprimand on Aug. 20 -- Moscow terminated the customs checks.
The reason Moscow struck out at Ukraine is apparent: Kiev has resisted joining Moscow's Eurasian Economic Community, the centerpiece of President Vladimir Putin's efforts to reintegrate the former Soviet republics (minus the Baltic states) under Russian leadership. Instead, Ukraine is seeking an Association Agreement with the European Union, which includes a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement to be signed in Vilnius this November.
That would allow Ukraine to maintain its independence rather than become economically and politically subservient to Russia.
So Moscow is now seeking to punish Kiev. Sergei Glazyev, an economic adviser to Putin, acknowledged in an interview after border procedures were tightened by Russia that this had been done ''in case Ukraine suddenly makes this suicidal step of signing the E.U. Association Agreement.''
Russian media warned that further economic actions might follow if Ukraine signed the free trade accord with the European Union.
Ukraine is not the only country in this part of the world subjected to economic pressure from Moscow.
Russia raised energy prices for Armenia this summer to show its displeasure with Yerevan's efforts to negotiate a free trade accord with the European Union. It has also plunked down $4 billion in arms for Armenia's regional rival, Azerbaijan, sharply increasing the chances of a military confrontation between the two.
Even Tajikistan hasn't escaped Moscow's wrath: The Kremlin has made it a habit to lash out at Tajik migrants working in the Russian Federation whose remittances -- essential for keeping the economy afloat back home -- are often withheld by employers.
Russia also has pressured Belarus into selling it a controlling share in its gas pipelines and domestic delivery network, and is bringing pressure to bear on its critical potash company, Belaruskali, to agree to a Russian takeover.
Economic coercion of this kind speaks volumes about Russia's geopolitical outlook. The Kremlin openly dismisses its neighbors' independence, territorial integrity and sovereignty. Glazyev, for example, called the idea of Ukraine's desire to take a European course an act of ''sick self-delusion.''
Only the European Union reprimanded Russia for the move against Ukraine. The United States remained silent.
The failure of Washington and the European Union to articulate a coherent policy for Eastern Europe, Ukraine, the Caucasus and Central Asia has been interpreted by Moscow as a tacit recognition of Russia's sphere of influence in the former Soviet Union -- and license for Moscow to seek renewed hegemony there.
The stakes are high. Even if Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Tajikistan and the rest are not paragons of liberal democracy, their independence and security should be in the interest of the United States and its allies in Europe.
Since it is unlikely that Russia's neighbors will passively accept a return to a Soviet-style past, Russia's policies could ultimately mean conflicts and long-term political instability.
Putin may believe, as he so famously declared several years ago, that the collapse of the Soviet Union was the greatest geopolitical disaster of the 20th century. But he should not be encouraged by the West's failure to formulate a coherent policy in Eurasia to believe that he can restore it. That would be the true catastrophe.

HEADLINE: Preserving Natural Capital

 BODY:
Regarding ''A good deal gone bad'' (editorial, Aug. 26): A key conclusion of the U.N. Rio+20 meeting in June 2012 was that developing countries should focus future development on the growth of nonpolluting green industries, including renewable energies. But these countries also appealed for international financial assistance to enable them to preserve great natural reserves and their globally significant biodiversity. Without aid the economic imperative to exploit mineral and energy resources can become irresistible, as Ecuador has now concluded after receiving derisory financial support from the international community. But, as a number of national finance ministries and international financial institutions have recognized, the only way countries can justifiably be persuaded to fund preservation of globally significant natural reserves is by assessing their value -- or natural capital -- in financial terms. This approach needs rapid implementation around the world to avoid calamities like that threatened in Ecuador.

Iran might just face the facts
Regarding ''Rouhani's biggest obstacle'' (Views, Aug. 16) by Ray Takeyh: If even Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republic's founder, had to face reality and end the eight years of war with Iraq, perhaps there is hope that today's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, will face the facts regarding the dangerous consequences of Iran's nuclear ambitions. It all may really come down to the skill with which the United States manipulates the carrots and sticks in upcoming negotiations with President Hassan Rouhani.

HEADLINE: The Mayoral Candidates on Transportation

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
Few topics can be as vexing to a New York City mayor as the transportation system -- encountered daily by nearly every resident and yet often beyond the control of City Hall. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, a state agency, controls the subways, buses, railroads and many bridges and tunnels. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey operates the area's major airports.
But a mayor, as Michael R. Bloomberg has demonstrated, can still leave myriad fingerprints on the city's transportation network. Mr. Bloomberg's successor will be left with a series of policies to continue, if he or she chooses -- from the expansion of bike lanes to a plan, now in its infancy, to allow green livery taxis to respond to street hails, as a yellow taxi would, in the Bronx, Brooklyn, northern Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island.
Some candidates have embraced Mr. Bloomberg's at-times polarizing transportation agenda, which often placed an emphasis on pedestrians and cyclists. Others have questioned it. But all say they are ready to keep the city moving. 
The New York Times asked the leading candidates in contested mayoral primaries three questions about transportation. The description of their positions is drawn from their responses and previous statements.
Would the number of bike lanes in the city increase, decrease or remain the same under your administration?
Bill de Blasio (D) said he would expand bike lanes and bike sharing, with a goal of raising the percentage of city trips taken by bike to 6 percent by 2020. The enthusiastic embrace of cycling represents a shift -- at least in tone -- for Mr. de Blasio, who once called the city's bike-friendly transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan, a radical.
John C. Liu (D) said the creation of lanes ''would be a community-driven process.'' He has been a frequent critic of the city's bike policy and the installation of some lanes, saying this year that removing existing lanes would be ''a likely scenario'' in pockets of Brooklyn and Queens if he were elected.
Christine C. Quinn (D) said lanes would increase on her watch, ''as long as it's done with community input.'' She was criticized by cycling advocates in January for joking to WNYC radio that bike lanes were ''in the category of things you shouldn't discuss at dinner parties.''
William C. Thompson Jr. (D) said that he had ''no plans to remove'' existing lanes and that his transportation commissioner would work with neighborhoods to determine where lanes should be added. He called for ''better lighted paths, better paved roads and larger signs that seniors and people with disabilities can read'' along existing lanes.
Anthony D. Weiner (D) said he would ''remove lanes that are either not working or are unsafe, while adding them wherever practical.'' While in Congress, he once used an obscenity to describe the mayor's bike lanes and told him that he would remove them from the streets. He later said he was kidding, and has softened his stance slightly, often brandishing his membership key for the city's bike-share program.
John A. Catsimatidis (R) said that ''the way the bike lanes were put in was wrong'' and took issue with the ''concrete barriers'' that border some of them -- presumably the dividers that accompany some create protected lanes. He said they had caused problems for fire trucks and ambulances responding to emergencies; the city has dismissed similar criticisms as unfounded in the past.
Joseph J. Lhota (R) said that he would increase the number of lanes, though he called for ''common sense in their placement.'' In the past, he has said that he ''could see'' removing existing lanes that he deemed problematic, mentioning that some bus drivers along the B63 route in Park Slope, Brooklyn, had complained about sharing space with bike riders.

In the past, he has said that he ''could see'' removing existing lanes that he deemed problematic, mentioning that some bus drivers along the B63 route in Park Slope, Brooklyn, had complained about sharing space with bike riders.
Name one thing you would do as mayor to improve subway service.
Mr. de Blasio, in keeping with the theme of his campaign, said he would ''address outer borough subway service needs,'' though he did not specify what policies he would promote.
Mr. Liu pledged to increase the city's contribution to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority by $100 million, and to urge Albany and Washington to increase financing for the agency as well. He did not specify what he hoped the extra money would yield. In the past, Mr. Liu has called for strengthening penalties against people who attack transit workers.
Ms. Quinn's ''one thing'' is a big one: wresting control of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority from the state government ''so New Yorkers are in charge of their own subway system.'' This is widely regarded as a political long shot. A more modest proposal from Ms. Quinn: countdown clocks outside subway stations, displaying train arrival information at street level.
Mr. Thompson said he would push to reduce waiting times between trains and to accelerate the installation of countdown clocks across the system -- already a priority of the transportation authority.
Mr. Weiner said he would push for majority voting control for the mayor and the city on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's board of 17 voting members. Currently, all board members are nominated by the governor, with four of them recommended by the mayor. Mr. Weiner has also called for the installation of cellphone service on every subway platform, which the authority has already planned.
One word: monorail. Its slogan: ''Not subway, above-way.'' Mr. Catsimatidis, arguing that elevated transit systems have proved economical in other cities, said ''there is no reason we can't look into those types of projects'' in New York. At a candidate forum in June, Mr. Catsimatidis said he imagined a monorail running alongside the Long Island Expressway.
Mr. Lhota, a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, called for a subway extension to Staten Island and shorter waiting times between trains to decrease overcrowding. He also said he would supply city financing to the authority to begin an in-station recycling program and to keep platforms clean.
How would you expand or improve taxi service outside Manhattan?
Mr. de Blasio, an opponent of the city's plan for street-hail livery cabs outside Manhattan, has called for something similar: ''outer borough medallions'' authorized for service in the other boroughs. A frequent recipient of donations from the yellow taxi industry, which fought the Bloomberg administration's plan in court, he has criticized the existing law because the Legislature approved it, bypassing the City Council.
Mr. Liu said he would require that all taxis be accessible, echoing a theme from his criticism of the Bloomberg administration's Taxi of Tomorrow. In December, Mr. Liu rejected the Taxi of Tomorrow contract -- a largely symbolic act that was not expected to affect its introduction -- noting that the vehicle, a Nissan NV200, was not wheelchair-accessible. (It can be retrofitted to become so.)
Ms. Quinn said she would embrace the Bloomberg administration's all-borough taxi plan, which has already brought a smattering of ''green cabs'' to the road. She has had a complicated relationship with the plan in the past. Under her leadership, the City Council did not pass the proposal, and Ms. Quinn has at times been noncommittal about its merits.
Mr. Thompson, who has been perhaps the most outspoken supporter of the mayor's all-borough taxi plan since it was upheld by the New York State Court of Appeals, said he planned to continue to put the proposal into effect after Mr. Bloomberg leaves office.
Mr. Weiner, an opponent of the all-borough taxi plan, said he would ensure that passengers in green cabs ''have access to cars that pass the same standards as the yellow cabs'' that patrol Manhattan.
In his response, Mr. Catsimatidis touched on bus rapid transit, a revamped network of deputy mayors and his belief that each borough requires affordable transportation options. He did not mention taxis.
Mr. Lhota said the city should ''allow market forces to take over'' and embrace technology like ride-hailing smartphone apps for both taxis and car services. He also expressed support for allowing the hailing of livery cabs outside Manhattan.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Energy Shares Bounce Back On Higher Oil Prices

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Wall Street rose on Wednesday, with energy shares rallying on higher oil prices as the United States and its allies came closer to military action against Syria.
Trading volume was thin and came after a drop in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index on Tuesday, to its lowest in two months. 
On Wednesday, stocks recouped some of the losses as traders bought energy stocks, which rose on a spike in oil prices as markets feared supply interruptions from the Middle East.
Energy shares rose 1.8 percent, by far the biggest gainer among the S.& P. 500 sectors. Chevron gained $3, or 2.5 percent, to close at $121.81. Exxon Mobil rose $2.02, or 2.3 percent, to $88.84. The two companies provided the biggest lifts to the Dow industrials and the S.& P. 500.
United States crude futures rose 0.4 percent. Those futures are up 5.3 percent over the last five sessions.
''If you want a hedge against Middle East uncertainty, energy shares will serve you well,'' said Jim McDonald, chief investment strategist at Northern Trust Global Investments.
Mr. McDonald, who helps oversee $803 billion in assets, said a ''surgical involvement'' by the West appeared more likely than ''broad-scale activity, which is enough to give investors comfort about the impact of any involvement.''
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 48.38 points, or 0.33 percent, at 14,824.51. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 4.48 points, or 0.27 percent, at 1,634.96. The Nasdaq composite index rose 14.83 points, or 0.41 percent, at 3,593.35.
Contracts to purchase previously owned American homes fell for the second consecutive month in July, with the decline much wider than expected.
''This shows that the increase in mortgage rates has taken the wind out of the housing market's sails a bit,'' Mr. McDonald said.
PulteGroup shares fell 21 cents, or 1.4 percent, to $15.38, and D. R. Horton lost 22 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $17.77. The PHLX housing sector index fell 0.35 percent.
The rally in energy shares bolstered the broader market, but it hurt airline stocks. The NYSE Arca airline index fell 0.8 percent, extending a 3.9 percent drop in the previous session. The US Airways Group fell 13 cents, or 0.8 percent, to $15.34.
Williams-Sonoma reported second-quarter earnings that beat expectations. The announcement was released before the market closed, and shares fell $2.47, or 4.2 percent, to $56.97.
Shares of the mining equipment manufacturer Joy Global fell $2.42, or 4.7 percent, to $48.89, after it reported a lower profit for the third quarter.
In the bond market, interest rates increased. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 15/32, to 97 23/32. Its yield rose to 2.77 percent, from 2.71 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Newly Released

BYLINE: By JOHN WILLIAMS

 BODY:
This month, short stories and novels explore troubled lives in vastly different worlds: the heartsick staff and residents of a psychiatric clinic, soldiers returning home to dead-end jobs, tigers maimed in a magical realm, and the passionate, reckless American abolitionist John Brown.
TUMBLEDOWNBy Robert Boswell429 pages. Graywolf Press. $26. 
Strict lovers of plot may not fall for the ruminative sprawl in this latest novel by the underappreciated Robert Boswell, but most everyone else will find a deft twining of irony and insight on nearly every page. Set in and around a rehab and therapy center in Southern California, the novel follows James Candler, poised to become the head of this cuckoo's nest, and his charges, including Mick and Karly, a sweet-natured schizophrenic and the young woman he loves. Mr. Boswell's creations are aware of their limitations, in ways both existential -- ''How could she measure her progress when she didn't know what it felt like to be anyone but herself?'' -- and humorous: ''She was tall and substantial. Puny guys made her feel all Easter Island.'' ''Tumbledown'' wryly mines the heartache in emotional disturbances, some present from birth and the rest brought on by the business of living.
LAST CAR OVER THE SAGAMORE BRIDGEBy Peter Orner198 pages. Little, Brown. $25.
The opening sentences of Peter Orner's lapidary stories are irresistible invitations to read further: ''Gary died before the divorce was finalized, before he'd even moved out.'' ''Henry's enemy lived in the room next door.'' ''My brother used to terrorize me with a small rubber hippopotamus named Longfellow.'' These very short tales -- 52, in less than 200 pages -- range without straining over a great expanse of time and experience: an affair at a hotel in 1912; a woman preparing to bury her troubled son in 1986; in 1999, a weary Communist in Prague reflecting on his life. The very briefest of them, less than a page long, can feel unnecessary; others that cover just five or six pages are more forcefully imagined than many novels. With this new publication and with the recent reissue of Mr. Orner's 2001 collection, ''Esther Stories,'' this is an ideal moment to appreciate a master of his form.
SAVE YOURSELFBy Kelly Braffet310 pages. Crown. $25.
Kelly Braffet's third novel follows damaged adults and at-risk teenagers in a depressed Pennsylvania town where the locals make fine distinctions between the Zoney's GoMart and the SuperSpeedy convenience stores. Patrick Cusimano works at Zoney's; lives with his brother, Mike; and is haunted by his father, who's serving time for a drunk-driving accident that killed a boy. Patrick is dangerously falling in love with his brother's girlfriend, Caro, when he meets Layla, a teenager rebelling against her strict religious parents by sporting black lipstick and hanging around with a vampiric pack leader named Justinian. In the second half of ''Save Yourself,'' details of disturbing gothic rituals are laid on a bit thick and the young-adult undertones in Layla's story grow louder. But there's storytelling skill to burn here. Ms. Braffet has empathy for her working-class characters and brings neglected places to convincing life.
THE GOOD LORD BIRDBy James McBride417 pages. Riverhead. $27.95.
Several novelists have been inspired by the life of John Brown, the fiery abolitionist whose raid of Harpers Ferry (in what was then Virginia) helped ignite the Civil War, but none quite like James McBride. ''The Good Lord Bird'' plays the grim tale for laughs. Plenty of them. Brown's exploits are here recounted in old age by Henry Shackleford, called Onion, who as a young slave found himself under Brown's wing and had to pass as a girl because of a misunderstanding. After Brown first describes his long-shot mission to take Harpers Ferry, Onion knows ''the Old Man's cheese had slid off his biscuit,'' and one of the soldiers says: ''I prefers a plan that keeps me from becoming an urn in somebody's backyard.'' The raucous tone is joined in the end by Onion's solemn understanding of Brown's courage for his cause. ''They could have used him in the great war that was to come, I'll say that.''
THE COLOR MASTERStoriesBy Aimee Bender222 pages. Doubleday. $25.95.
With the fairy-tale aesthetic ascendant in popular culture, Aimee Bender's coy brand of magical realism has lost some of its novelty. Her sense of the unfamiliar suddenly feels too familiar. In ''The Devourings,'' a human woman marries an ogre, who accidentally eats their children. In ''Tiger Mending,'' an expert seamstress repairs animals that have been torn along their stripes. Luckily, Ms. Bender is also skilled at creating tales that read like entries from Oliver Sacks's cabinet of real-life wonders. In ''Faces,'' a boy can't recognize people. In ''The Fake Nazi,'' a man claims to have committed atrocities that he couldn't have. (''He was a revisionist but backwards, adding horrors instead of denying them.'') Ms. Bender remains a sharp-eyed observer, as when she describes ''a man with tattoos but the old kind, before tattoos became dainty and about spiritual life. This man wore tattoos from the time when tattoos meant you liked to kick people around.''
BRIEF ENCOUNTERS WITH THE ENEMYBy Saïd Sayrafiezadeh223 pages. The Dial Press. $25.
Several of the characters in Saïd Sayrafiezadeh's stories have just returned from war to deep-recession America. One is an underpaid teacher, another works in a company's mail room. Others toil (and shop) at Walmart. They accept platitudinous thanks from fellow citizens and offer halfhearted enthusiasm in return. With or without the war, they're the kind of men who are unprepared for the present and flummoxed by the future. They're in distant touch with their desires and aspirations, but an ultimate sense of hopelessness pervades their lives. ''I had dreams of grandeur,'' one character says. ''I didn't know how to get there, but I knew that it would work out.'' Mr. Sayrafiezadeh's prose is confident and polished, but the incidents and epiphanies in these stories carry a whiff of the writer's workshop. It's hard to shake the impression that these are gritty lives being made to fit tidy templates.

HEADLINE: Obama Commemorates King's 'Dream' Speech

 BODY:
Following is the text of President Obama's speech at the Lincoln Memorial commemorating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, as transcribed by Federal News Service:
MR. OBAMA: To the King family, who have sacrificed and inspired so much, to President Clinton, President Carter, Vice President Biden, Jill, fellow Americans, five decades ago today, Americans came to this honored place to lay claim to a promise made at our founding.
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
In 1963, almost 200 years after those words were set to paper, a full century after a great war was fought and emancipation proclaimed, that promise, those truths remained unmet. And so they came by the thousands, from every corner of our country -- men and women, young and old, blacks who longed for freedom and whites who could no longer accept freedom for themselves while witnessing the subjugation of others. Across the land, congregations sent them off with food and with prayer. In the middle of the night, entire blocks of Harlem came out to wish them well. 
With the few dollars they scrimped from their labor, some bought tickets and boarded buses, even if they couldn't always sit where they wanted to sit. Those with less money hitchhiked, or walked. They were seamstresses, and steelworkers, and students, and teachers, maids and pullman porters. They shared simple meals and bunked together on floors.
And then, on a hot summer day, they assembled here, in our nation's capital, under the shadow of the great emancipator, to offer testimony of injustice, to petition their government for redress and to awaken America's long-slumbering conscience.
We rightly and best remember Dr. King's soaring oratory that day, how he gave mighty voice to the quiet hopes of millions, how he offered a salvation path for oppressed and oppressors alike. His words belong to the ages, possessing a power and prophecy unmatched in our time.
But we would do well to recall that day itself also belonged to those ordinary people whose names never appeared in the history books, never got on TV.
Many had gone to segregated schools and sat at segregated lunch counters, had lived in towns where they couldn't vote, in cities where their votes didn't matter. There were couples in love who couldn't marry, soldiers who fought for freedom abroad that they found denied to them at home. They had seen loved ones beaten and children fire- hosed. And they had every reason to lash out in anger or resign themselves to a bitter fate.
And yet they chose a different path. In the face of hatred, they prayed for their tormentors. In the face of violence, they stood up and sat in with the moral force of nonviolence. Willingly, they went to jail to protest unjust laws, their cells swelling with the sound of freedom songs. A lifetime of indignities had taught them that no man can take away the dignity and grace that God grants us. They had learned through hard experience what Frederick Douglas once taught: that freedom is not given; it must be won through struggle and discipline, persistence and faith.
That was the spirit they brought here that day.
That was the spirit young people like John Lewis brought that day. That was the spirit that they carried with them like a torch back to their cities and their neighborhoods, that steady flame of conscience and courage that would sustain them through the campaigns to come, through boycotts and voter registration drives and smaller marches, far from the spotlight, through the loss of four little girls in Birmingham, the carnage of Edmund Pettus Bridge and the agony of Dallas, California, Memphis. Through setbacks and heartbreaks and gnawing doubt, that flame of justice flickered and never died.
And because they kept marching, America changed. Because they marched, the civil rights law was passed. Because they marched, the voting rights law was signed. Because they marched, doors of opportunity and education swung open so their daughters and sons could finally imagine a life for themselves beyond washing somebody else's laundry or shining somebody else's shoes. (Applause.) Because they marched, city councils changed and state legislatures changed and Congress changed and, yes, eventually the White House changed. (Cheers, applause.)
Because they marched, America became more free and more fair, not just for African-Americans but for women and Latinos, Asians and Native Americans, for Catholics, Jews and Muslims, for gays, for Americans with disabilities.
America changed for you and for me.
And the entire world drew strength from that example, whether it be young people who watched from the other side of an Iron Curtain and would eventually tear down that wall, or the young people inside South Africa who would eventually end the scourge of apartheid. (Applause.) Those are the victories they won, with iron wills and hope in their hearts. That is the transformation that they wrought with each step of their well-worn shoes. That's the depth that I and millions of Americans owe those maids, those laborers, those porters, those secretaries -- folks who could have run a company, maybe, if they had ever had a chance; those white students who put themselves in harm's way even though they didn't have to -- (applause) -- those Japanese- Americans who recalled their own interment, those Jewish Americans who had survived the Holocaust, people who could have given up and given in but kept on keeping on, knowing that weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning -- (cheers, applause) -- on the battlefield of justice, men and women without rank or wealth or title or fame would liberate us all, in ways that our children now take for granted as people of all colors and creeds live together and learn together and walk together, and fight alongside one another and love one another, and judge one another by the content of our character in this greatest nation on Earth.
To dismiss the magnitude of this progress, to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed -- that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years. (Applause.) Medgar Evers, James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, Michael Schwerner, Martin Luther King Jr., they did not die in vain. (Applause.) Their victory was great.
But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete. The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but it doesn't bend on its own. To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency. Whether it's by challenging those who erect new barriers to the vote or ensuring that the scales of justice work equally for all in the criminal justice system and not simply a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails -- (applause) -- it requires vigilance.
(Cheers, applause.)
And we'll suffer the occasional setback. But we will win these fights. This country has changed too much. (Applause.) People of good will, regardless of party, are too plentiful for those with ill will to change history's currents. (Applause.)
In some ways, though, the securing of civil rights, voting rights, the eradication of legalized discrimination -- the very significance of these victories may have obscured a second goal of the march, for the men and women who gathered 50 years ago were not there in search of some abstract idea. They were there seeking jobs as well as justice -- (applause) -- not just the absence of oppression but the presence of economic opportunity. For what does it profit a man, Dr. King would ask, to sit at an integrated lunch counter if he can't afford the meal?
This idea that -- that one's liberty is linked to one's livelihood, that the pursuit of happiness requires the dignity of work, the skills to find work, decent pay, some measure of material security -- this idea was not new.
Lincoln himself understood the Declaration of Independence in such terms, as a promise that in due time, the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men and that all should have an equal chance.
Dr. King explained that the goals of African-Americans were identical to working people of all races: decent wages, fair working conditions, livable housing, old age security, health and welfare measures -- conditions in which families can grow, have education for their children and respect in the community.
What King was describing has been the dream of every American. It's what's lured for centuries new arrivals to our shores. And it's along this second dimension of economic opportunity, the chance through honest toil to advance one's station in life, that the goals of 50 years ago have fallen most short.
Yes, there have been examples of success within black America that would have been unimaginable a half-century ago. But as has already been noted, black unemployment has remained almost twice as high as white employment (sic), Latino unemployment close behind. The gap in wealth between races has not lessened, it's grown.
As President Clinton indicated, the position of all working Americans, regardless of color, has eroded, making the dream Dr. King described even more elusive.
For over a decade, working Americans of all races have seen their wages and incomes stagnate. Even as corporate profits soar, even as the pay of a fortunate few explodes, inequality has steadily risen over the decades. Upward mobility has become harder. In too many communities across this country in cities and suburbs and rural hamlets, the shadow of poverty casts a pall over our youth, their lives a fortress of substandard schools and diminished prospects, inadequate health care and perennial violence.
And so as we mark this anniversary, we must remind ourselves that the measure of progress for those who marched 50 years ago was not merely how many blacks had joined the ranks of millionaires; it was whether this country would admit all people who were willing to work hard, regardless of race, into the ranks of a middle-class life. (Applause.) The test was not and never has been whether the doors of opportunity are cracked a bit wider for a few. It was whether our economic system provides a fair shot for the many, for the black custodian and the white steelworker, the immigrant dishwasher and the Native American veteran. To win that battle, to answer that call -- this remains our great unfinished business.
We shouldn't fool ourselves. The task will not be easy. Since 1963 the economy's changed.
The twin forces of technology and global competition have subtracted those jobs that once provided a foothold into the middle class, reduced the bargaining power of American workers.
And our politics has suffered. Entrenched interests -- those who benefit from an unjust status quo resisted any government efforts to give working families a fair deal, marshaling an army of lobbyists and opinion makers to argue that minimum wage increases or stronger labor laws or taxes on the wealthy who could afford it just to fund crumbling schools -- that all these things violated sound economic principles.
We'd be told that growing inequality was the price for a growing economy, a measure of the free market -- that greed was good and compassion ineffective, and those without jobs or health care had only themselves to blame.
And then there were those elected officials who found it useful to practice the old politics of division, doing their best to convince middle-class Americans of a great untruth, that government was somehow itself to blame for their growing economic insecurity -- that distant bureaucrats were taking their hard-earned dollars to benefit the welfare cheat or the illegal immigrant.
And then, if we're honest with ourselves, we'll admit that during the course of 50 years, there were times when some of us, claiming to push for change, lost our way. The anguish of assassinations set off self-defeating riots.
Legitimate grievances against police brutality tipped into excuse- making for criminal behavior. Racial politics could cut both ways as the transformative message of unity and brotherhood was drowned out by the language of recrimination. And what had once been a call for equality of opportunity, the chance for all Americans to work hard and get ahead was too often framed as a mere desire for government support, as if we had no agency in our own liberation, as if poverty was an excuse for not raising your child and the bigotry of others was reason to give up on yourself. All of that history is how progress stalled. That's how hope was diverted. It's how our country remained divided.
But the good news is, just as was true in 1963, we now have a choice. We can continue down our current path in which the gears of this great democracy grind to a halt and our children accept a life of lower expectations, where politics is a zero-sum game, where a few do very well while struggling families of every race fight over a shrinking economic pie. That's one path. Or we can have the courage to change.
The March on Washington teaches us that we are not trapped by the mistakes of history, that we are masters of our fate.
But it also teaches us that the promise of this nation will only be kept when we work together. We'll have to reignite the embers of empathy and fellow feeling, the coalition of conscience that found expression in this place 50 years ago.
And I believe that spirit is there, that true force inside each of us. I see it when a white mother recognizes her own daughter in the face of a poor black child. I see it when the black youth thinks of his own grandfather in the dignified steps of an elderly white man. It's there when the native born recognizing that striving spirit of a new immigrant, when the interracial couple connects the pain of a gay couple who were discriminated against and understands it as their own. That's where courage comes from, when we turn not from each other or on each other but towards one another, and we find that we do not walk alone. That's where courage comes from. (Applause.)
And with that courage, we can stand together for good jobs and just wages. With that courage, we can stand together for the right to health care in the richest nation on earth for every person. (Applause.) With that courage, we can stand together for the right of every child, from the corners of Anacostia to the hills of Appalachia, to get an education that stirs the mind and captures the spirit and prepares them for the world that awaits them. (Applause.) With that courage, we can feed the hungry and house the homeless and transform bleak wastelands of poverty into fields of commerce and promise.
America, I know the road will be long, but I know we can get there. Yes, we will stumble, but I know we'll get back up. That's how a movement happens. That's how history bends. That's how, when somebody is faint of heart, somebody else brings them along and says, come on, we're marching. (Cheers, applause.)
There's a reason why so many who marched that day and in the days to come were young, for the young are unconstrained by habits of fear, unconstrained by the conventions of what is. They dared to dream different and to imagine something better. And I am convinced that same imagination, the same hunger of purpose serves in this generation.
We might not face the same dangers as 1963, but the fierce urgency of now remains. We may never duplicate the swelling crowds and dazzling processions of that day so long ago, no one can match King's brilliance, but the same flames that lit the heart of all who are willing to take a first step for justice, I know that flame remains. (Applause.)
That tireless teacher who gets to class early and stays late and dips into her own pocket to buy supplies because she believes that every child is her charge -- she's marching. (Applause.) That successful businessman who doesn't have to, but pays his workers a fair wage and then offers a shot to a man, maybe an ex-con, who's down on his luck -- he's marching.
(Cheers, applause.) The mother who pours her love into her daughter so that she grows up with the confidence to walk through the same doors as anybody's son -- she's marching. (Cheers, applause.) The father who realizes the most important job he'll ever have is raising his boy right, even if he didn't have a father, especially if he didn't have a father at home -- he's marching. (Applause.) The battle-scarred veterans who devote themselves not only to helping their fellow warriors stand again and walk again and run again, but to keep serving their country when they come home -- they are marching. (Applause.) Everyone who realizes what those glorious patriots knew on that day, that change does not come from Washington but to Washington, that change has always been built on our willingness, we, the people, to take on the mantle of citizenship -- you are marching. (Applause.)
And that's the lesson of our past, that's the promise of tomorrow, that in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it. And when millions of Americans of every race and every region, every faith and every station can join together in a spirit of brotherhood, then those mountains will be made low, and those rough places will be made plain, and those crooked places, they straighten out towards grace, and we will vindicate the faith of those who sacrificed so much and live up to the true meaning of our creed as one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. (Cheers, applause.)

HEADLINE: Saluting a Dream, and Adapting It for a New Era

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and SHERYL GAY STOLBERG; Jonathan Martin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama stepped into the space on Wednesday where the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once stood, summoning his iconic dream of a colorblind society in a celebration of a half-century of progress and a call to arms for the next generation.
On a day of overcast skies and misty rain, tens of thousands of Americans -- black, white and every shade in between -- returned to the site of Dr. King's ''I Have a Dream'' speech to listen to the nation's first black president pay tribute to the pioneers who paved the way for his own ascension to the heights of American government.
''Because they kept marching, America changed,'' the president said as Dr. King's family watched. ''Because they marched, a civil rights law was passed. Because they marched, a voting rights law was signed. Because they marched, doors of opportunity and education swung open so their daughters and sons could finally imagine a life for themselves beyond washing somebody else's laundry or shining somebody else's shoes.
''Because they marched,'' he added, ''city councils changed and state legislatures changed and Congress changed and, yes, eventually, the White House changed.'' 
The symbolic journey from Dr. King to Mr. Obama on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial animated the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom more than any oratory. While Mr. Obama's line about the White House changing was his only reference to his unique place in history, the power of his presence was lost on no one.
But it also underscored the challenge to a movement to reframe its mission for a new era. With an African-American in the Oval Office, it is harder to argue about political empowerment than it was in 1963, and much of the day's message centered on tackling persistent economic disparity, as well as newer frontiers of civil rights like equality for gay men and lesbians.
Several of the speakers, including former President Jimmy Carter, tied the historic nature of the event to controversies of the moment, including the Trayvon Martin case, New York's police frisking policy and the Supreme Court ruling this summer that overturned part of the Voting Rights Act. ''I think we know how Dr. King would have reacted,'' Mr. Carter said.
Yet former President Bill Clinton said that for all of the current challenges, Americans have never had more opportunity to shape the future if they can put aside their differences. ''It is time to stop complaining and put our shoulders against the stubborn gates holding the American people back,'' he said.
The three presidents effectively reflected three eras in the civil rights movement: Mr. Carter, the white Southerner who appointed more African-Americans to high-ranking positions than did any of his predecessors; Mr. Clinton, who was so attuned to race issues that he was called the country's first black president; and Mr. Obama, who really is the first and who represents the generation that came of age after the battles of the past.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, who may seek to be the next president, did not attend, and aides declined to explain why. But on hand were Caroline Kennedy and Lynda Johnson Robb, daughters of the two presidents most associated with civil rights, as well as a phalanx of celebrities, like Oprah Winfrey, Bill Russell, Jamie Foxx and Forest Whitaker.
Some lions of the civil rights era were there, including Representative John Lewis, former Ambassador Andrew Young and the Rev. Joseph Lowery -- grayer, thicker, slower, but stirring emotions of their youth. ''We ain't going back,'' Dr. Lowery declared. ''We ain't going back. We've come too far, marched too long, prayed too hard, wept too bitterly, bled too profusely and died too young to let anybody turn back the clock on our journey to justice.''
Many members of Dr. King's family participated as well, including his 85-year-old sister, Christine King Farris. The Rev. Bernice King, his daughter, noted that women were largely missing from the speakers list in 1963, but they were a significant presence 50 years later. She delivered a rousing call to ''let freedom ring'' before the ringing of a bell saved from the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala., where a bombing by the Ku Klux Klan killed four girls just weeks after Dr. King's speech.
Although Republican lawmakers were critical to the passage of civil rights legislation in the 1960s, no prominent party leaders were on stage on Wednesday. The two living former Republican presidents, George Bush and George W. Bush, both cited health in missing the occasion. The Republican National Committee held a luncheon honoring the march on Monday, and party leaders issued statements, including the younger Mr. Bush and Mitt Romney.
''Dr. King was on this earth just 39 years, but the ideals that guided his life of conscience and purpose are eternal,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Honoring him requires the commitment of every one of us.''
At age 52, Mr. Obama is too young to remember the march, and, raised in Hawaii as the son of a white mother and a father from Kenya, his own connection to the civil rights movement is more distant than, say, that of his wife, Michelle, whose parents grew up in segregated America. But he clearly felt the pressure to live up to the moment on Wednesday, noting that ''no one can match King's brilliance.''
More sober than stirring until near the end, when he adopted more of a preacher's cadence, Mr. Obama used his 29-minute address, nearly twice as long as Dr. King's original, to argue for a renewed mission to ensure that opportunity is available not just for a few but for the many, for ''the black custodian,'' ''the white steelworker'' and ''the immigrant dishwasher.''
''The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice,'' the president said, adopting a line from Dr. King, ''but it doesn't bend on its own. To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency.''
He was to a large extent preaching to the choir. This was a crowd of supporters, many from the Washington area, and to them, it was a day to reflect not only on Dr. King's legacy but also on Mr. Obama's. Those old enough to remember the march marveled at a black president's standing where Dr. King had.
''If you say that's not the fruition of the dream, I don't know what is,'' said Bill Carr, a licensed clinical social worker from Montclair, N.J., who is black.
Nearby stood Bill Tate, a retired engineer who is white and who wore a button from the original march, when he was a student at the University of Maryland. ''Who would have guessed 50 years ago that in less than 50 years we would re-elect -- re-elect! -- a black president?'' he asked. ''No one can deny that we've made some progress.''
Among the witnesses to that progress was Gil Lyons, who worked for the Postal Service at the time and was told his pay would be docked if he attended the march. Now 82, he works as a Park Service interpreter, teaching visitors about national monuments, including the new King Memorial.
Mr. Lyons recalled being moved to tears by Dr. King's address. ''I felt that something good was going to happen to America, and look at 1600,'' he said, referring to the White House. ''People said we would have a black president. I said to myself I probably would never see one. But what can I say? In my time, Obama came along.''
William Andrew Allison, 92, was also there that day, and he has kept a sign from the march in his closet ever since. Mr. Allison took it out of storage on Wednesday and had it with him as he sat on a bench between the White House and the Mall. ''I thought I'd come back,'' he said. ''It had been 50 years.''
Still, some changes since then were more disconcerting. Snipers kept watch from the roof of the Lincoln Memorial, while the three presidents sat behind a clear bulletproof shield. Security barriers discouraged many from moving about freely, and risers for news media cameras blocked the view of the Lincoln Memorial.
If the 1963 march had an air of freedom and spontaneity, the event on Wednesday felt at times choreographed and forced. When Mr. Young addressed the crowd, he did so in song, delivering a moving rendition of ''Woke Up This Morning With My Mind Stayed on Freedom.'' But when he implored the crowd to join in, the few who did could barely be heard.
''We're not here to declare victory,'' Mr. Young later told the crowd. ''We're here to simply say that the struggle continues.''

HEADLINE: Bank of England's Governor to Keep Interest Rates Low

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
LONDON -- The Bank of England's new governor took his ideas for spurring Britain's sluggish economy on the road on Wednesday, traveling to the heart of the country to convince households and managers that interest rates will remain low and that he will not follow the United States in reining in the bank's stimulus efforts just yet. 
The new governor, Mark Carney, used the speech to talk directly to the backbone of the British economy: the owners of small and medium-size businesses.
''The knowledge that interest rates will stay low until the recovery is well established should give greater confidence to households to spend responsibly and businesses to invest wisely,'' Mr. Carney said in Nottingham, a city 110 miles north of the bank's offices in London.
Mr. Carney's main mission is to shore up the nation's economy, which has lagged behind competitors in rebounding from the worst global recession since the 1930s.
The United States economy has grown 5 percent over the last five years, but Britain is producing 3 percent less than it did at the start of the recession, Mr. Carney said.
His main act since taking the helm at the start of July has been to introduce an element of ''forward guidance'' to the bank's monetary policy. The idea is that by indicating that borrowing costs will not rise for some time, businesses and households will be encouraged to invest and spend. The Federal Reserve has had such guidance for years.
However, Mr. Carney's initial guidance this month generated some unwanted uncertainty.
On Aug. 1, he said that Britain's benchmark rate would remain at a record 0.5 percent until unemployment fell to 7 percent, from the current 7.8 percent, or up to three years. Many economists thought the unemployment threshold meant interest rates might rise far sooner than expected and Britain's borrowing rates in the markets increased.
In his speech on Wednesday, at the University of Nottingham, Mr. Carney said that the bank would not raise interest rates until ''jobs, incomes and spending are recovering at a sustainable pace.'' He also said that the 7 percent threshold would not necessarily lead to a rise in the interest rate.
''The Bank of England's task now is to secure the fledgling recovery, to allow it to develop into a period of sustained and robust growth,'' he said. ''We aim to get there in part by reducing the uncertainty that has held back growth.''
Mr. Carney also touched on bigger themes. In the international arena, he explained that Britain must detach its monetary policy from that of the United States.
''While much has been made of the special relationship between the U.S. and U.K., it is not so special that the possibility of a reduction in the pace of additional stimulus in the U.S. warrants a current reduction in the degree of monetary stimulus in the U.K,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Tensions on the Cul-de-Sac

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
MEMPHIS -- Beneath the spreading shade tree in Laura Holcomb's front yard, there are some 70 varieties of hosta, stands of elephant ear and a Japanese maple. For the 17 years she has owned the brick house on Rose Trail Drive in the Hillshire subdivision, Ms. Holcomb has devoted herself to her home and garden.
Across the street, the Osborne family has been tenants for two years, moving in after the previous owner lost the house in a foreclosure. They are happy to have a decent place to call home but, like many renters, they have not done much to improve the appearance or join the community.
They are not alone: the family behind Ms. Holcomb, the one two doors down, and several in the cul-de-sac across the way are among the renters who have been supplanting homeowners in this blue-collar, suburban neighborhood as investors buy single-family homes and convert them to rentals. 
''Used to, we knew our neighbors,'' Ms. Holcomb said. Then she gestured toward the few remaining owner-occupied houses nearby. ''Except for the two that have been here, I don't know any of my neighbors.''
Across the country, a growing number of single-family rentals provide an option for many who lost their homes in the housing crash through foreclosure and for those who cannot obtain a mortgage under today's tougher credit conditions. But the decline in homeownership is also changing many neighborhoods in profound ways, including reduced home values, lower voter turnout and political influence, less social stability and higher crime.
''When there are fewer homeowners, there is less 'self-help,' like park and neighborhood cleanup, neighborhood watch,'' said William M. Rohe, a professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who has just completed a review of current research on homeownership's effects.
Even conscientious landlords and tenants invest less in their property than owner-occupants, he said. ''Who's going to paint the outside of a rental house? You'd almost have to be crazy.''
Despite signs of a recovery in the housing market, the country's homeownership rate is still on the decline. In Memphis, it has fallen from roughly 65 percent of families in 2005 to about 55 percent now, according to the Census Bureau.
In hundreds of neighborhoods that once attracted first-time home buyers, investors have stepped in, buying up tens of thousands of homes for the rental market.
That has helped put paying tenants in a number of homes that were vacant or becoming eyesores. And many of the new tenants say they are eager to buy a home at the first opportunity and share the same concerns as homeowners about maintaining a safe and healthy neighborhood for their families and children.
But it has also raised the ire of some homeowners whose tidy subdivisions have changed, seemingly overnight, into a parade of strangers.
Hillshire was built in the late 1970s, its single-story, three-bedroom homes designed with no particular architectural pedigree, but not ticky-tacky identical. As a young mother of two, Ms. Holcomb, a medical practice administrator, chose the neighborhood because of its school district, paying $73,000 for her home in 1996.
The homeowners interviewed for this article tended to have steady middle-class incomes; several were retired military and police officers. Among the renters, who pay about $900 to $1,000 a month, were several construction and restaurant workers, with lower, less reliable earnings.
On a recent evening, parents pushed strollers and lawn mowers droned, children played on a tire swing and in one driveway, a longtime resident and his grandson tinkered with the fat tire of a slick red drag racer.
But there was a seedy underside. Jimmy Fumich, a homeowner and air-conditioner repairman, said he had been in court that day as a witness in an animal cruelty case against a neighbor, a renter, who had left a dog chained to a stop sign in the heat. She was already in trouble, he said, for breaking into an empty house on the block.
Mr. Fumich, who is Ms. Holcomb's brother, mentioned a couple of meth houses and one that had been used as a brothel. All were rentals. Police department records show that major crime in the area, which does not include drug offenses, has actually gone down since spiking in 2010.
Still, Lea Ann Braswell, the captain of the neighborhood watch, recounted a recent episode in which a teenage girl, whose throat police said was cut by a young man carrying a sword, sought refuge on Ms. Braswell's doorstep.
''We used to have hardly anything happen,'' she said.
Asked how many renters were active with the neighborhood watch, Mr. Fumich said, ''Zero.''
What is watchful to some, however, can feel intrusive to others. In the home of Carl Osborne, 26, one resident who keeps a close eye on things is referred to as ''Nosy Neighbor.''
Mr. Osborne, who parks his boat and the DirecTV van he drives for work out front, rents the house across the street from Ms. Holcomb with his wife, two children and collection of exotic birds. ''We just look for somewhere that's safe for your kids,'' he said. ''That's all I'm worried about, my kids and my wife.''
Hillshire does not have a homeowners association to enforce rules about uncut lawns, abandoned cars or rented units. And despite the changes, the neighborhood is largely trim and neat. But in cities like Las Vegas and Atlanta, where homeowners associations are more common, some have struggled with how to handle the influx of renters.
When investors started buying town homes in the small, Atlanta-area community of Austin Park, where units that once sold for over $100,000 now go for as low as $30,000, homeowners did not at first enforce a rental cap because they preferred landlords over vacant units that were no longer paying association dues.
After a summer of loud music, barking dogs, prostitutes and two tenants served with a murder warrant, the board changed its mind, said Joi Aikens, the president of the homeowners association.
Phasing out the rentals will take time, since the association has to wait until a home becomes vacant or is sold.
''You're caught between 'I want the dues paid' and 'I want a peaceable, nice existence,' '' Ms. Aikens said.
Investors, however, say they have done a service to neighborhoods plagued by foreclosures, by helping to nudge home values upward and renovating and maintaining formerly vacant homes.
''Where we go in, we go in to fix that house up, and we're the best-looking house on the street when that goes through,'' said Kent Clothier Sr., the senior partner of Memphis Invest, which buys and renovates homes, sells them to mostly out-of-town investors, then manages the property for them. ''That's good for the neighborhood.''
Memphis Invest's tenants stay two years on average, the company said, and about two out of 10 are former homeowners who lost their homes and want to maintain a similar lifestyle while they repair their credit.
Those reluctant renters dislike other renters almost as much as many homeowners do.
In a small cul-de-sac near Hillshire -- or what in Memphis is called a ''cove'' -- Rusby Amador cooked dinner for her three sons while waiting for her husband, a tile layer, to get home. One son was hosing off the walkway of their rented home. Two prodigious Boston ferns hung in the entry, and at the curb a colorful ceramic urn sat atop the mailbox.
''When the people buy a house, the people's more nice,'' Ms. Amador said.
''Renters, they don't care about neighbors. We don't know who's going to move in. We worry all the time because we don't know. I have children.''
Ms. Amador, 33, said the family had bought a new home in 2004 but had not checked the terms of the mortgage carefully, and the payments had grown too high. Now, she said, they are saving to buy again.
Across the street, their neighbor Monica Costict is the last homeowner left on the cove. She, too, is looking to get out of the neighborhood and buy somewhere else. ''When we leave,'' she said, ''we're going to rent out the house.''

HEADLINE: San Bernardino Wins Eligibility For Bankruptcy From a Judge

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- A federal bankruptcy court judge granted the city of San Bernardino eligibility for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday, raising the possibility that the city will propose a plan to dig itself out of debt by cutting money promised to the public pension system.
The ruling by Judge Meredith Jury came despite opposition from the powerful California Public Employees' Retirement System, more commonly known as Calpers. 
San Bernardino, a working-class city of 240,000 about 60 miles east of Los Angeles, declared Chapter 9 bankruptcy last summer, saying it had effectively run out of money to pay for day-to-day operations, in large part because of pension obligations.
Lawyers for Calpers had argued that the city should not treat pension funds like other creditors. For the past year, Calpers has also argued that the city has not provided enough documentation for the court to rule in the bankruptcy case and that the city had ignored warnings about a financial crisis for years and filed for bankruptcy as a matter of convenience.
But in her ruling on Wednesday, Judge Jury said that it had been clear for months that San Bernardino was insolvent and that only its most recent financial predicaments were relevant.
''Because they didn't do something then, doesn't mean they can't now,'' Judge Jury said in the Riverside, Calif., courtroom. ''The city desires and needs to formulate a plan; it is their only hope.''
All of the 10,000 creditors are better served by allowing the bankruptcy to go forward, Judge Jury added.
''I can't see anything other than dissolving the city if they can't reorganize under Chapter 9,'' the judge said. ''They can't make cash where it isn't. If they got all the money they want -- who isn't going to get paid? All the employees? I don't know, how does that help Calpers if the employees aren't paid?''
''The citizens of this city deserve a chance,'' she said.
A similar court battle is brewing in Detroit, which in July became the largest city in the country's history to file for bankruptcy.
City officials there have said that they will need to cut current and future pension benefits in bankruptcy. But public unions say that pension benefits are protected by Michigan's Constitution. A federal bankruptcy judge is to hear initial oral arguments in the Detroit case on Sept. 18.
While the rulings in the San Bernardino case do not necessarily set a precedent for Detroit, the cases center on the same federal laws. Municipal finance experts say the issue of how public pension funds are handled after cities declare bankruptcy could find its way to the Supreme Court.
Last year, San Bernardino stopped making biweekly payments to Calpers, making it the first California city to do so. At roughly $260 billion, Calpers is the biggest pension fund in the country and is San Bernardino's largest creditor.
Stockton, a Northern California city that declared bankruptcy in 2012, has continued to pay all money owed to the pension system, but the judge in that case has said the pension fund is likely to become a key issue for the city in its restructuring plan.
Many employees in San Bernardino left just before the city declared bankruptcy last year and received payments from the city, which Calpers argued gave preferential treatment to some employees and was a sign that the city was not acting in good faith. Judge Jury said that while the decision might not have been financially wise, it did not impede the city's ability to declare bankruptcy.
''The employees of the city weren't stupid,'' she said. ''Anybody that had any other options was going to leave.''
In a statement, Calpers said that it would participate in the bankruptcy proceedings and at the same time ''aggressively pursue all past due contributions'' and would consider appealing.
''These payments are statutorily required and necessary to deliver on the pension benefits promised to San Bernardino employees as a form of deferred compensation,'' the statement said. ''They have worked for and earned these benefits.''

HEADLINE: Figuring Out What Time Is the Right Time to Start Hiring

BYLINE: By SUZANNE SATALINE

 BODY:
It can be challenging for Willan Johnson to know how many people to employ at his pool-cleaning business, VivoPools, in Los Angeles, for a number of reasons.
First, he needs more people in the warmer months. He also has to consider where his jobs are and how long it will take his workers to drive from one job to another. Some jobs take longer than others, because vacuuming and scrubbing take more time than chemical treatments. Plus, he said, ''Everyone wants their residential pool service on Friday.''
Of course, like most business owners, Mr. Johnson always wants to avoid having too many people and not enough work.
''Determining when and how many employees to hire is a bit tricky for our business as the demand for services varies based on account growth, seasonality, geography of homeowner addresses and customer requests,'' said Mr. Johnson, who started the company four years ago. 
Many small-business owners remain skittish about hiring. The National Federation of Independent Business reported that nearly 80 percent of small, private companies made no hiring changes in July and 12 percent let workers go.
Especially after the recession, many owners have been reluctant to spend the money to hire workers, especially if there's a chance demand will recede and the workers will have to be laid off. The on-again, off-again recovery hasn't helped. And with small businesses representing 49.2 percent of private sector employment, according to the Small Business Administration, this reluctance has inevitably had an impact on unemployment rates.
Some owners have turned to paying overtime, which makes it easier to scale back if demand slips. The downside is that it can be expensive and it can lead to an overworked staff.
For example, the work force at Narragansett Creamery in Providence, R.I., has grown slowly even as more customers are drawn to the company's homemade yogurt and cheeses, said Mark Federico, the owner. Started in 2007, the company has grown to a staff of 30.
''We found that if we worked too many hours for too long a period of time, people get burned out,'' Mr. Federico said. ''People need days off. It's not scientific, and we're not right all the time.''
Based on the experiences of owners like Mr. Johnson and Mr. Federico, this small-business guide looks how owners determine when it's time to hire.
HOURS WORKED Mr. Johnson said he ran his employment numbers weekly, as clients were added and lost, to ensure he had enough people. He uses a spreadsheet to help him decide when the company can support the wages of new employees.
He keeps careful count of the number of pools the company cleans and the hours required for each job. He separates residential jobs, which typically require 30 minutes of time, from those at commercial pools, which can take two hours.
To calculate the required number of employees, Mr. Johnson estimates the number of hours required to clean all client pools and divides that by a standard 40-hour workweek. When the result is greater than the number of employees on staff, he makes a new hire.
THE PAYROLL PERCENTAGE Earlier this year, when there was a surge in demand for swimming lessons at SwimLabs, in Highlands Ranch, Colo., Michael Mann was taken by surprise. Suddenly, the 15 full-time employees he keeps during the off-season -- as opposed to 25 or more during spring and summer -- were not enough.
Opened in 2006, SwimLabs offers one-on-one lessons to children and adults. All students are videotaped and analyzed as they take their strokes in small pools equipped with water jets.
The company saw the same surge in business after the 2012 Summer Olympics.
''The Olympics always elevates the sport,'' said Mr. Mann, who holds several masters swimming records. His business got an extra boost because the four-time gold medalist Missy Franklin lived nearby.
To decide how many instructors he needed to hire, Mr. Mann looked at monthly gross earnings and calculated that the payroll should consume a maximum of 25 percent of his operating costs. If he generates an additional $10,000 a month in revenue, he knows he can afford another instructor who is paid $2,500 a month. As a result, Mr. Mann started hunting for two more part-time instructors.
CALL VOLUME Growth can be deceptive. Sometimes, efficiencies may keep three times as many customers from meaning three times as much work. That is a lesson learned by Hudl, a company in Lincoln, Neb., that builds video analysis tools for coaches in 20 different sports, allowing them to break down plays and share them with their players.
The company's big market is high school football. In the 2011 season, its six-person service team went from working with 2,000 teams to working with more than 6,600. ''We were staying up all night'' to manage problems like software bugs, said Bryant Bone, who heads the support team. Clearly, Hudl needed help.
Mr. Bone had noticed that between 2009 and 2010 Hudl's clientele had risen by more than 550 percent, to 2,300 teams from 350 -- but the volume of service calls had grown by only about 400 percent. Mr. Bone reasoned that service calls would continue to rise at a lower rate than the number of clients as the company improved its software design, development and training.
Given that, he concluded that Hudl needed to increase its support team at a rate between 70 and 80 percent of the company's client growth. Today, the company has 105 employees.
''We trust that a combination of better design, development processes and more experienced users helps keep our overall growth outpacing our team's size,'' Mr. Bone said.
BACKLOG ORDERS Like SwimLabs, PeggyBank in Omaha got caught short-handed recently. The company scans family photographs, VHS tapes and slides, preserving them in digital formats.
Its founder, James Simon, made a deal with a social commerce Web site that offered discount coupons for PeggyBank's services. Orders poured in, and the staff was soon overwhelmed. Suddenly, it was taking four to five weeks to finish some projects, as opposed to the customary two. And some employees were logging up to 15 hours of overtime a week. That prompted Mr. Simon to hire more help.
He said that he tried to avoid the problem by looking at two crucial data points every day: the number of orders in the queue and the time it was taking for the orders to be fulfilled.
He knows that he needs more workers when he is ''running an excessive amount of overtime and the orders aren't getting filled,'' said Mr. Simon, who employs 16 people. ''When I see the number of orders in the backlog start to breach 100, that's my cue to start hiring people,'' he said. ''When it gets over 100, I know our production times will take longer than two weeks to turn around.''
COMMON SENSE There are times when numbers do not tell the real story. Sometimes, Mr. Simon said, the best indication that he has to hire more people is when his supervisor starts screaming from the production floor, ''Hey! We need serious help down here!''
''That's the God's honest truth,'' he said. ''I listen to her instincts more than anything else.''

HEADLINE: East by Far East: Vladivostok Rocks

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
VLADIVOSTOK, Russia -- ''Ilya! Ilya!'' came the chant from the crowd of thousands in the central square here on a recent night. Clad in a retro-futuristic silver suit, Ilya Lagutenko, this city's hometown star and the frontman of one of the country's most popular bands, Mumiy Troll, flipped his hair and sang, in English and Russian, about love, sailors and other matters of local pride.
The rock show's setting -- in this formerly closed-off Soviet military enclave -- is one of the last places you would expect to find a posse of multicultural indie rockers. But last week, Vladivostok, a port town in Russia's Far East, morphed into a kind of South by Southwest on the Sea of Japan. Over four days, more than 40 acts, mainly from Russia and Asia, played free shows in clubs, parks and the main square, taking bows across from an imposing memorial dedicated to ''Fighters for Soviet Power.''
This was V-Rox, billed as the first rock festival of its kind in Russia. The similarity to SXSW, the expansive festival that helped put Austin, Tex., on the map as a destination for creative types, was intentional, said Mr. Lagutenko, who dreamed up V-Rox. 
Its presence here speaks to the reach of an Internet-bred musical culture that mints earnest rock stars and connects hip-hop heads from Brooklyn to Shanghai. Fans arrived here from Ukraine and Siberia, and members of panel sessions came from across the globe. Vladivostok, which 25 years ago didn't allow visitors, was, for a few days at least, an international artistic beacon.
A growing number of such festivals show how far fans whose musical appetite has been stoked by online listening and social media are willing to travel for a memorable offline experience. Other examples include Iceland Airwaves, in Reykjavik; the Midi showcases across China; and Traenafestival, on Nordic islands around the Arctic Circle.
''Whatever is happening in Russia's music industry, it's so similar to whatever happens in China, in Korea,'' Mr. Lagutenko, 44, said backstage before his show. ''I'm talking to any small or big artist, independent or corporate. Right now, all over the world, the ideas are the same.''
Roland Swenson, a founder and the managing director of SXSW, Austin's $200 million economic and marketing engine, sees that pattern in the plethora of copycat festivals. ''I get a call almost every week from some city somewhere that wants to start an event like SXSW,'' he said.
There were practical and economic goals in creating V-Rox, too. Mr. Lagutenko's hope was that bringing it to Vladivostok, a shrinking city of less than 600,000 bordered by China and a ferry ride away from Japan, would help it become a gateway to the Asia-Pacific region, a hope that has also been expressed by the Putin administration. Though it's more than 5,000 miles from Moscow, this city and the surrounding Primorsky Krai region have received $20 billion in federal funds over the last two years for infrastructure projects, largely to prepare for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting held here in 2012. At a cost of more than $1 billion, a bridge was built to connect Vladivostok to Russky Island, a former secret military base, where the city also erected a massive university complex.
The complex remains empty (the development in this case outpacing the need), so during the festival, it was used as housing for the visiting V-Rox performers. They treated it as their own private campus, jamming and drinking together into the wee hours. Though the Kremlin has been increasingly intolerant of political dissent, whether it comes packaged in pop culture or not -- the activists of Pussy Riot being but one example -- V-Rox and its mostly apolitical musicians seem to have escaped judgment so far.
The city was behind V-Rox, buying lights and sound equipment, and providing security. Unsmiling policemen in peaked caps guarded the main stage. Other financial help came from sponsors like S7 Airlines, based in Siberia, which flew in guests free (albeit with a layover in Novosibirsk).
The mayor, Igor Pushkarev, introduced Mumiy Troll's performance himself, and on Monday, he pronounced V-Rox a hit, saying that 30,000 people attended its events, although that number wasn't independently verifiable. Organizers also said that 25,000 people watched a live stream. These days, Vladivostok -- the name loosely translates to ''conqueror of the East'' -- is ''no different than the West,'' Mr. Pushkarev said in an interview. To succeed, ''Vladivostok needs to be integrated into global culture.'' He added, ''The gates are open.''
That wasn't always the case. When Mr. Lagutenko was growing up here, and Vladivostok was considered a strategic naval base, he was sealed off from outside influences, and the Russian rock scene was nearly nonexistent. ''The actual idea of having rock bands in Soviet Union was totally out of anyone's agenda,'' he said. Making a living by playing in a band was ''a fantasy,'' he added.
Now, Mr. Lagutenko has homes in Los Angeles, Moscow and Vladivostok, and there's a plugged-in Russian rock world. Alex Gagarin, 34, a self-described indie rocker from Yekaterinburg, in the center of Russia, has had a band, Sansara, for 15 years and welcomed the chance to make his mark globally at V-Rox. ''People think the only vital things happen in Europe and America, but that hasn't been true for a long time,'' he said.
Into the mix of Russian acts, V-Rox brought artists representing a range of styles: No Brain, a Korean punk band; Emufucka, Japanese electronica; and a Singaporean rapper and D.J., Mark Bonafide and Andrew Chow. (The sole American, Julien-K, is best known for writing a hit for the '90s rap-rockers Korn.) Though the bills were unfamiliar, locals turned out. ''I'm pro these kind of concerts,'' Elena Kuzmina, 49, a postal worker, said as she walked through the square on Saturday. A Friday show on the beachfront drew retirees and teenagers, both sets dancing bravely to a local punk act.
For the artists, the draw is clear: They need the festival platform to build the exposure and connections that record labels used to offer. ''In the industry today,'' Mr. Lagutenko said, ''there aren't big companies that can right away put you on the map, because they don't have the resources like that anymore.''
For music insiders, V-Rox provided the thrill of the truly undiscovered. ''It's a city I've never heard of, and it's all bands that I don't know -- which is great,'' said Alan Miller, a co-founder of Filter, the music magazine, who came to be on a panel at V-Rox.
The learning curve extended from festivalgoers to performers. ''Tchaikovsky, Tolstoy, Pushkin,'' the members of the Korean band Goonamguayeoridingstella said, listing what they knew of Russian culture. They were aware, though, of Russia's strictures on homosexuality. Eem Byung Hak, 33, the bassist for the group -- a Seoul jam band nicknamed Goonam -- said he supported gay rights but did not consider boycotting V-Rox. ''I don't think of this festival as politics, just friendship,'' he said.
But V-Rox is still a long way from the must-attend status and accessibility of SXSW. (Not to mention the tacos.) Marketing itself smoothly is something the town may still need help with. A promotional video shown at the festival, for example, boasted that Vladivostok has ''the most beautiful girls'' around. ''People don't think there's anything going on here, culturally,'' fretted Yuliya Kryukova, 28, a singer with the polished Moscow group InWhite, which performed at Mumiy Troll's Music Bar on Sunday night.
She grew up in St. Petersburg, listening to Mumiy Troll; now her tastes run to Radiohead and lesser-known British acts like James Blake. ''My generation, we got the opportunity to listen to a lot of different music all at once,'' she said, adding that this was a pivotal moment in Russia, creatively. ''For a long time, we were in a cultural vacuum,'' which left her unsure of her place as an artist, she said.
But after spending days with musicians from around the world, she felt she belonged. ''It's clear,'' she said, ''that we're on the same level.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Boehner Wants a Debt Fight

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Just when Speaker John Boehner should be warning his members not to use the debt ceiling as a threat, he is doing exactly the opposite. Instead of reminding lawmakers that they are obligated to pay for the debts they voted to incur, he is once again waving the dull saber of default. 
At a fund-raiser in Idaho on Monday, Mr. Boehner repeated his old vow not to raise the debt ceiling this fall unless Republicans get an equal amount in cuts and reforms -- on top of the nearly $2 trillion in cuts over a decade that they won using the same extortion tactic in 2011.
''It may be unfair, but what I'm trying to do here is to leverage the political process to produce more change than what it would produce if left to its own devices,'' he said. ''We're going to have a whale of a fight.''
It's more than ''unfair'' to wage this fight again; it's a reckless abdication of Mr. Boehner's responsibility to guide House Republicans away from the brink. Too many Tea Party members of the House have spread the dangerous falsehood that a default would be of little consequence, that it would merely shake up Washington a bit and cut the deficit, which is already declining. One of them, Ted Yoho of Florida, recently said that a default would actually raise the government's credit rating.
No responsible economist or business leader agrees with that. In 2011, the credit rating of the United States declined when Republicans merely threatened not to raise the limit. If they actually refused to raise the debt ceiling, the markets would crash, interest rates would skyrocket, benefit checks and military spending would be at risk, and the fragile economic recovery would probably grind to a halt.
Mr. Boehner, who has previously said he would not allow a default to take place, should be reminding House members of the potential catastrophe instead of encouraging their worst impulses and raising their hopes that this ''whale of a fight'' could win them new victories.
President Obama has said he will not negotiate over the debt limit, but the need for a quick vote -- the Treasury said the current limit would expire in mid-October -- means that negotiations will inevitably be commingled with the talks on spending for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
Republicans are pushing for immediate cuts even below the levels of the sequester and seem to think they could use the debt limit to force the White House into long-term entitlement reductions.
Whatever the outcome of the 2014 budget talks, it is critical that the White House make it clear, in public and in private, that it will not give in to the same debt-ceiling blackmail, this year or any other year.

HEADLINE: The Second Dimension

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
President Obama has often quoted the line made famous by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., that ''the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.'' The idea is, like Mr. Obama himself, full of both caution and hope. 
In his remarkable speech Wednesday afternoon commemorating the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington, Mr. Obama amended the quote for a new and warier age. The arc ''may bend towards justice,'' he said, ''but it doesn't bend on its own.''
On a cloudy day filled with reminiscences, Mr. Obama's remarks were a bracing reminder of the work that remains -- of ''our great unfinished business,'' as he put it.
Dr. King's speech echoed throughout Mr. Obama's own -- he rode its stirring rhythms and repeated its most spiritual passages -- but as he has almost always done when navigating the thicket of race in America, Mr. Obama managed to enlarge the conversation to include the struggles and dreams of all Americans.
The civil rights movement was not only about race, he said, but about a ''second dimension of economic opportunity,'' not only about justice, but about jobs. The measure of progress on this plane is ''whether this country would admit all people who are willing to work hard regardless of race into the ranks of a middle-class life.''
It is here, Mr. Obama said, that the goals of the civil rights movement have ''fallen most short.'' The president has grown more comfortable discussing economic inequality openly in his second term, and not a moment too soon. In that light it was gratifying to hear him take aim at ''those who benefit from an unjust status quo,'' who resist ''minimum-wage increases or stronger labor laws or taxes on the wealthy'' in the name of supposedly ''sound economic principles.''
It is entirely fair to hold Mr. Obama's actions up to the light of the promise in his most soaring speeches and be dissatisfied; he is the president, and his success is measured not in soothing words but in concrete results. Still, as Dr. King knew well, words inspire movements, and movements fuel the deepest and most lasting change.
Mr. Obama is aware of this, and he emphasized it again on Wednesday. Speaking to the country's young people in particular, those ''unconstrained by habits of fear,'' Mr. Obama suggested that the arc of the universe was bent by citizens -- parents and teachers and businesspeople and veterans, getting up each day and ''marching'' toward a fairer, more just and more equal America.

 BODY:
4:30 P.M. (HBO) GLICKMAN (2013) In 1936, the Bronx-born Marty Glickman, above, a national sprinting champion, earned a spot on the United States Olympic track team as part of the 400-meter relay. But in Berlin, with Hitler in the stands, Mr. Glickman and Sam Stoller -- the only Jews on the relay team -- were replaced the day before the event by Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe, ostensibly because ''secret'' German runners were expected to challenge for the gold. (Mr. Glickman, who died in 2001, maintained that anti-Semitism was at work.) The Americans won the race; the Germans finished a distant fourth. After returning to the United States, Mr. Glickman eventually found his niche in basketball and football broadcasting. Despite being rejected for a ''more Midwestern'' announcer when the N.B.A. finally signed a network contract, he became the voice of the Giants during the 1950s and '60s and the Jets in 1972. This documentary from James L. Freedman, who produced Mr. Glickman's late-night radio show as a high school senior, brings to light some of his pioneering techniques, phrases and programming innovations. Marv Albert, Bob Costas, Bill Bradley, Frank Gifford and Larry King weigh in. 
10:30 A.M. (Showtime) THE LAST PLAY AT SHEA (2010) The histories of Shea Stadium (above), the Mets, Billy Joel (below) and New York City itself intersect in this documentary from Paul Crowder that focuses on Mr. Joel's concerts on July 16 and July 18, 2008 -- the last performances given in the stadium, which was torn down the next year. '' 'The Last Play at Shea' has a built-in happy ending that is almost too good to be true,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York Times, discussing the sudden appearance of Paul McCartney. ''For the July 18 concert, Mr. McCartney miraculously appeared, having been whisked through customs at Kennedy International Airport after a flight from London that had been allowed to land early. He was sped to the stadium by a motorcade in 11 minutes and driven onto the field in time to perform by Pete Flynn, the dedicated groundskeeper who had driven the Beatles to the same stage 43 years earlier,'' on Aug. 15, 1965. Mr. Holden added: '' 'If it weren't for the Beatles,' Mr. Joel declares, 'I wouldn't do what I do.' Call it perfect symmetry. The final number, 'Let It Be,' rings as a sweet valedictory to all the struggle, the teamwork and the glory captured in this wonderful film.''
8:30 P.M. (13) METROFOCUS The newsmagazine looks at job creation in New York with a visit to a grocery store in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Rafael Pi Roman, the show's host, interviews Laura Kusisto of The Wall Street Journal about the region's economic recovery. He also speaks with the mayoral candidate Joe Lhota about why it's important that New York City workers begin paying for their health care, and with Peter Kareiva, the chief scientist of the Nature Conservancy, about a study outlining the value of marshes and dunes in protecting coastal residents from storms.
9 P.M. (Lifetime) PROJECT RUNWAY The contestants glean inspiration for their designs from shoes. Kaley Cuoco of ''The Big Bang Theory'' and Anne Fulenwider, the editor in chief of Marie Claire, are the guest judges.
10 P.M. (Bravo) EAT, DRINK, LOVE The series moves into a new time slot as Waylynn breaks her policy of not dating chefs, Brenda confronts Kat about her reputation, and Jessica seeks her father's approval during a visit before receiving an e-mail that could jeopardize her career.
10 P.M. (Food Network) CHEF WANTED WITH ANNE BURRELL Ms. Burrell, a chef and culinary educator, helps restaurateurs find executive chefs by putting candidates to the test. In this episode, four applicants demonstrate their ability to oversee operations at multiple establishments and to create new menu items using fresh seafood.

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: Economics as Science

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''What Is Economics Good For?'' (Sunday Review, Aug. 25): 
I disagree with Alex Rosenberg and Tyler Curtain's characterization of science in general and economics in particular. They claim that a scientific discipline is to be judged primarily on its predictions, and on that basis, they suggest, economics doesn't qualify as a science.
Prediction is certainly a valuable goal in science, but not the only one. Explanation is also important, and there are plenty of sciences that do a lot of explaining and not much predicting. Seismology, for example, has taught us why earthquakes occur, but doesn't tell Californians when they'll be hit by ''the big one.''
And through meteorology we know essentially how hurricanes form, even though we can't say where the next storm will arise.
In the same way, economic theory provides a good understanding of how financial derivatives are priced (notwithstanding Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Curtain's snarky reference to the Black-Scholes model). But that doesn't mean that we know whether the derivatives market will crash this year.
Perhaps one day earthquakes, hurricanes and financial crashes will all be predictable. But we don't have to wait until then for seismology, meteorology and economics to become sciences; they already are.

HEADLINE: The Cost of Nuclear Power: Contrasting Views

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Eduardo Porter (''Coming Full Circle in Energy, to Nuclear,'' Economic Scene column, Aug. 21) asserts that new nuclear plants constitute ''potentially the cheapest energy source of all.'' But there are many facts to the contrary. 
Wall Street ended loans for new reactors in the late 1970s because of high costs. After a decade in which a nuclear revival has been promoted, only two new plants are under construction, and they are slowed by costly delays. After 15 years of no shutdowns, four American reactors have closed this year, with more shutdowns predicted. Executives claim that nuclear power cannot compete in the marketplace with sources like natural gas and wind.
The underlying reason for high nuclear costs is that reactors are dangerous, requiring many highly trained staff members, a complexity of expensive parts, compliance with extensive regulations, and antiterrorist measures to minimize public exposure to hazardous radioactivity.
The 1954 promise by the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, Lewis Strauss, that nuclear power would be ''too cheap to meter'' remains unfulfilled.
JOSEPH MANGANO Executive Director Radiation and Public Health Project Ocean City, N.J., Aug. 22, 2013
To the Editor:
Eduardo Porter has grasped the fundamental issue: Fossil fuels are becoming unacceptable, and nuclear can compete. With nuclear generators averaging 90 percent of capacity year round, wind at 30 percent and solar at 15 percent just do not cut it. Also, the intermittent nature of making electricity from the wind and the sun will always relegate those sources to minor status. How can you run an economy when the power dies on calm or cloudy days?
The upfront cost of nuclear is indeed daunting, but the reality is that those costs are spread over 60 or more years. That's why today's nuclear plants are such bargains, having been efficiently producing power for decades after the big initial investment.
Operating under the strict regulations in this country, nuclear energy is safe and clean, and the next generation of plants is even better. There are not a lot of good choices in energy today, but nuclear is one of them.

The writer is past president of the American Nuclear Society.

HEADLINE: Putin's Silence on Syria Suggests His Resignation Over Intervention

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Russia has made its opposition to military intervention in Syria vehemently clear. The foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, warns daily about the risk of an escalating conflagration. A deputy prime minister said the West dealt with the Islamic world like ''a monkey with a grenade.'' A few commentators on the fringe have warned of World War III.
The one voice that has remained silent, though, is the one that matters most. 
President Vladimir V. Putin has conspicuously avoided public comment on reports of a chemical weapons attack on civilians outside of Damascus, the Syrian capital, on Aug. 21, which killed hundreds of people. Instead he has carried on, like many ordinary Russians, as if the civil war in Syria had not reached an ominous new phase. In the days after the attack, Mr. Putin attended a ceremony for the restoration of a fountain made famous in World War II, visited a breakaway province of neighboring Georgia and toured a mine and dam in Siberia.
There is no doubt about Mr. Putin's opposition to retaliatory strikes. Nor about his support of the government of President Bashar al-Assad in a conflict Mr. Assad has described as a war against Islamic extremism.
Mr. Putin's public reticence, though, reflects a calculation that Russia can do little to stop a military intervention if the United States and other countries move ahead without the authorization of the United Nations Security Council -- and that he has little to lose at home, at least, if they do.
Mr. Lavrov, in remarks to reporters this week, made it clear that Russia's reaction to international intervention in Syria would be limited to a war of words -- ''We, of course, are not planning to go to war with anybody,'' he said. That stance could ultimately benefit Mr. Putin.
The crisis has added fuel to an anti-American sentiment -- and to a lesser degree anti-Western sentiment -- that had already become a refrain of Mr. Putin's return to the presidency in 2012.
The point is driven home over and over by proxy in the state news media and in comments by officials, like the one about the monkey, posted on Twitter by a deputy prime minister, Dmitri O. Rogozin. Or by Robert A. Schlegel, a member of the lower house of Parliament from the majority United Russia party, who said in a statement on Wednesday that Western retaliatory strikes would aid Al Qaeda and would constitute ''the height of cynicism.''
Suspicion of President Obama only intensified after his decision to scuttle a summit meeting next week in Moscow and to describe Mr. Putin in unusually personal terms at a news conference, saying his body language often made him look ''like the bored kid in the back of the classroom.''
Though Mr. Obama went on to say that their interactions were often constructive, the comment infuriated Mr. Putin, according to one Russian official not authorized to be quoted by name.
More is at stake in Syria than a propaganda coup. While critics accuse Mr. Putin of blindly supporting Mr. Assad's brutality, regardless of the circumstances, Mr. Putin's abiding concerns are foreign intervention and the rise of Islamic extremism.
In his view, the United States and its partners have unleashed the forces of extremism in country after country in the Middle East by forcing or advocating change in leadership -- from Iraq to Libya, Egypt to Syria.
While American and European leaders have cited what they call mounting evidence of the use of chemical weapons by Syrian government forces, Russian officials continue to warn against a rush to judgment so precipitous that it can be seen only as a pretext for what they call the real motive: the overthrow of Mr. Assad.
Mr. Lavrov and other officials here say that the source of the chemical attack could well have been the rebels themselves, with the aim of provoking an international response that would turn the tide of the conflict.
Late Wednesday the Kremlin reported that Mr. Putin had spoken with Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, saying that both agreed that the use of chemical weapons was ''fundamentally unacceptable,'' but adding that the crisis in Syria should be settled ''using purely political and diplomatic means.''
In his only other reported interaction with a world leader since the crisis escalated, Mr. Putin told Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain that Russia did not have evidence of ''whether a chemical attack took place,'' or, if it did, who was behind it, according to a statement released by Mr. Cameron's office.
A few dissenting voices in the United States and Europe have expressed skepticism toward the evidence, but here such skepticism is the consensus.
''It would be absolutely insane for Assad to use chemical weapons when the red line had been so clearly drawn,'' said Aleksei K. Pushkov, the chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Parliament's lower house. ''He's not a madman. He reasons logically.''
Another factor in Mr. Putin's stance has been the general indifference to the war here.
''Of course, we can do without Assad or without Syria,'' said Georgy I. Mirsky, a researcher at the Institute of World Economy and International Relations, a Russian research group. ''It's not a matter of life and death for us. The much bigger principle -- the global principle -- is by no means to be seen as bending down under American pressure.''

HEADLINE: India's Economic Crisis

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Because any serious crisis causes a rush to safe havens, India&#8217;s economic difficulties will be made worse if fiscal policy disputes in the United States are not resolved, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
In 2005-6 the consensus among leading international policy makers, including the finance ministers who make up the governing body of the International Monetary Fund, was that economic and financial crises were a thing of the past. The United States and Europe had evolved beyond the potential for serious instability, and middle-income emerging markets had learned hard lessons from their experience over the previous decades, so their policies would be much more careful going forward. Serious crises, if they occurred at all, would be limited to war-torn, low-income countries.
This view was completely wrong. We are now partway through a full cycle of crises, beginning with the United States (from 2007) and Europe (from 2008 in earnest). It is now the turn of emerging markets to face real problems, including India, a country that experienced great and long overdue success for 20 years. 
There are several types of emerging market crisis. One of the more common varieties starts in the following manner. There is a boom, based on natural resources or finding new niches for manufacturing exports or even implementing sensible liberalization measures. The private sector expands and more prominent companies find it increasingly easy to borrow overseas. Dollar (or other foreign currency-denominated) loans become attractive because they carry a lower interest rate than does borrowing in domestic currency.
International investment banks beguile the local elite - the economic and political people who make policy decisions - with stories of how their country and the world has changed, so it makes sense to borrow more. This is not a hard sell. Policy makers want to believe they have found the special elixir of economic growth and, in recent years, to believe they have "decoupled" from the prolonged recessions and slow growth in the United States and Western Europe.

And issuing debt - "increasing leverage," in the jargon - feels like alchemy during good times. If you put less money down to buy an asset (i.e., less equity and more debt in your purchase) and the asset appreciates in value - then you have a made a great return on your equity. But you are almost certainly not thinking about risk-adjusted returns, i.e., what happens when asset prices fall. Less equity means the value of your debt will exceed the value of your asset that much sooner.
Put all this together, and you have a classic recipe for vulnerability. Capital inflows (borrowing overseas plus foreigners coming into the local stock market) tend to keep the exchange rate more appreciated than it would be otherwise. This encourages imports and discourages exports, so it is easy to develop a current account deficit (meaning that the country buys more goods and services from the rest of the world than it sells).
This is sustainable as long as the capital continues to flow in - particularly as long as companies can issue debt in dollars. But as John C. Bluedorn, Rupa Duttagupta, Jaime Guajardo and Petia Topalova of the I.M.F. point out in a new working paper, "Capital Flows Are Fickle: Anytime, Anywhere," at least since 1980 "private capital flows are typically volatile for all countries, advanced or emerging, across all points in time." 
No one is immune from the fickle nature of credit in the world economy. International banks love countries until about five minutes before they start trashing them to clients - for example, because they feel (as now) that growth in China and other emerging markets is definitely slowing.
Shifts in sentiment are unavoidable. The question is: how leveraged are you when this happens and how much debt do you need to refinance while markets are feeling negative about your prospects?
While the generic description above is a helpful framework, the Indian situation has important special features, as Devesh Kapur of the University of Pennsylvania and Arvind Subramanian, my colleague at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, have stressed. In particular, policy makers have not made the mistake of trying to cling to a fixed exchange rate (i.e., there is no explicit commitment to peg the rupee to a precise rate relative to the dollar).
As a result, the rupee is able to depreciate without too much drama, and this by itself should, over time, help to reduce imports and increase exports. India's foreign debts are mostly private, and the government's fiscal position, while not strong, is also not as weak as seen in Latin America in the 1980s or some European countries more recently. 
(To be precise: there is a large annual budget deficit - the headline number is around 9 percent of gross domestic product - but recent growth and a significant degree of inflation mean that debt relative to G.D.P. is projected to be around 66 percent by the end of 2013. This is gross debt, as reported in the I.M.F.'s latest Fiscal Monitor; the I.M.F. does not compile data on net government debt.)
Indian foreign exchange reserves remain at relatively strong levels, at least in comparison with past crisis experiences elsewhere. 
This is not to play down the pressures. The effect of exchange rate depreciation is to push up domestic inflation, in part because much of India's oil is imported (and world oil prices are in dollars, so depreciation immediately pushes up the domestic price in rupees).
Weakening confidence in the Indian economy has been compounded by some policy confusion in recent months, which has further encouraged domestic residents to move funds out of the country. But the central bank's signaling of its intentions is likely to become clearer, with some tightening of policy, including modest interest rate increases, following the appointment of Raghuram Rajan as the new central bank governor. (I worked for Mr. Rajan in 2004-5, when he was chief economist at the I.M.F., and I was his successor in that position.)
Still, there is political pressure to keep the economy growing ahead of elections in early 2014, so we should not expect fiscal policy to tighten. And if the Federal Reserve does indeed tighten monetary policy in the United States - currently referred to as "tapering" its purchase of bonds - that will tend to push up interest rates and is likely to attract more capital out of emerging markets.
The Fed's mandate is, by law and by convention, to worry about the United States economy, although officials in Washington are willing to provide outside assistance when things get sufficiently bad (e.g., the dollar funding provided to European banks, directly and indirectly, in the darkest days of 2008-9).
Terrence Checki of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York got it half right when he said recently, "Fundamentals are fundamental," and "experience suggests that one cannot overstate the importance of sound economic management, strong fiscal positions, credible proactive monetary policy and rigorous financial-sector oversight." 
He was talking about the American perspective on what emerging markets need to do - and the trajectory that countries like India must convince foreign investors they are on.
Of course, Mr. Checki was not talking about the United States, where economic management is shaky, the fiscal position is weak (and another budget crisis looms in October), and monetary policy has struggled to keep up with dealing with the consequences of failed financial-sector oversight (an unfortunate development in recent decades, for which the New York Fed shares responsibility).
When the United States faces a serious crisis, as in fall 2008, the world becomes unstable and capital flows into the United States, because the dollar is the ultimate reserve currency.
When a country like India faces crisis, for domestic reasons but also perhaps because of what is happening in the United States, capital tends to flow out of that country and toward safe havens (like the United States).
You can wring your hands about this system as much as you like - and central bankers around the world have been complaining even more than usual in recent weeks. But this is the way the world works, and this is how it will work for the foreseeable future.
The message is borrower beware, always. As the United States heads toward its next crazy confrontation over the federal government's debt ceiling, heavily indebted emerging markets face serious risks.

HEADLINE: Matt Damon Tries to Get Clean Water and Toilets for India's Poor

BYLINE: ANJALI THOMAS


HIGHLIGHT: Matt Damon helps poor Indians get micro-finance for clean water and toilets. 

 BODY:
Matt Damon finds it a challenge to get people to care about water. It's why he was in India from Aug. 23 to 26 on a four-day tour. Not to promote his latest film Elysium, a sci-fi dystopia with a socialist underpinning, but to help the rural and urban poor in India get access to clean water and sanitation by investing in tube wells, hand pumps and toilets with proper drainage facilities.
Mr. Damon cofounded Water.org, a Missouri-based nonprofit organization that partners with microfinance institutions to facilitate loans, so that people can afford the "dignity of a toilet" and "clean water." In the five years that the organization has been active in India, it has helped 500,000 people in 11 states get microloans, and now the goal is increase this to 800,000 by 2016. It is a high bar that Mr. Damon and the group's cofounder, Gary White, have set for themselves. Along with Mr. White, an engineer who has been working in the field of water sanitation for 23 years, Mr. Damon visited villages in the southern state of Tamil Nadu and urban slums in Bangalore, talking to women and children who have benefited from the project. 
The actor has shed all traces of his latest character - the bald, tattooed, gun-toting Max Da Costa desperate for salvation in Elysium. On his India tour, he was Matt Damon, the philanthropist fighting for clean water, a role he takes very seriously.
"Going out, doing these side visits and talking to women about how empowering and liberating this is for them is the funnest part," Mr. Damon said in an interview in Mumbai on Monday. Instead of spending hours waiting to collect water, women can seek employment and earn an income.
"To hear that they no longer have to leave the house when the sun goes down and walk out for open defecation because there is no toilet," he said. "It's very emotional to talk about these very, very real changes. It is sheer joy.
He arrived in India Sunday afternoon, and spent two days in villages at Kanchipuram, Pondicherry and Villupuram in Tamil Nadu, after which he traveled to Bangalore, where he toured two urban slums and spoke to women and self-help groups.
A woman Mr. Damon and Mr. White spoke to in Bangalore used to pay two rupees every time she wanted to use a public toilet. On a typical day, she and her family of seven would spend 20 rupees to use the toilet and an equal amount on bathing facilities. The woman and her family were committed to getting a water and sanitation loan, and constructed a toilet with proper drainage facilities in their home, Mr. White said. The family's monthly repayment is around 1,200 rupees ($18). The average interest rate is 18 to 22 percent. Water.org is not a charity as much as it helps empower people to plan, finance and execute their own solutions.
For the actor, the rawest and most emotional aspect of his work is the response from women and children.
"Whenever you bring water and sanitation to a community, the response is exactly the same, be it in India or Haiti or anywhere," he said. "There is absolute elation and joy. You sit down and interview people and hear about the changes in their lives, the dramatic impact."
The development aid organization sees women as vehicles of change.
"It's no secret that if you really want to affect the greatest change, you need women," Mr. Damon said. "Maybe I'm biased because I have four daughters. But girls are better."
He recalled an interaction with a 13-year-old girl from Haiti who, before the organization's intervention, would spend three hours a day collecting and hauling water for her family. He asked her what she was going to do with the free time.
"I asked her if she was going to get more time for homework, and she said, 'I don't need more time for homework. I'm the smartest in my class,'" he recalled. "And she said this in a way that I knew she was the smartest in her class. She said, 'I'm going to play.' I realized that the girl was the same age as my oldest daughter."
Mr. White said that almost 90 percent of the borrowers are women.
"It's interesting, because though India is patriarchal, I see so many strong women here; the leadership they exhibit especially when it comes to health, hygiene, water and sanitation."
The two men met in New York in 2008 at the Clinton Global Initiative and officially launched Water.org the next year when the actor merged his nonprofit, H2O Africa, with WaterPartners, an organization that Gary White cofounded in 1990.
"H2O Africa was something we created to try identify smaller NGOs that were doing good work. But as I started digging into the water issue, I realized that that wasn't really the solution," Mr. Damon said. He wanted to take a more sophisticated and sustainable approach, and started looking for people who were experts in this field. "That's what led me to Gary."
Water.org works with local communities, NGOs and municipal authorities in developing nations such as India, Bangladesh, Haiti, Ethiopia and Kenya. What sets it apart from the majority of nonprofit organizations is its operational model and a system called Water Credit, which Mr. White had launched in India in 2007 by partnering with microfinance institutions. Initially, it was a challenge because microfinance institutions did not believe that this was an income-generating market. The organization corrected this misconception by providing microfinance institutions grants to undertake market research and prove to themselves that there is a demand in this sector, launch a new portfolio, and hire experts to administer the loans.
This model has the power to eliminate loan sharks and middlemen. One woman they met in Bangalore had gone to a money lender and was paying a 125 percent interest on her loan.
"People are willing to do these extraordinary things for the dignity of a toilet," Mr. White said. "We jumpstart the market. Once we provide them with that support, microfinance institutions can borrow from commercial banks and then reach out to those in need."
The immediate hurdle is the rising cost of capital. "We really hope that we can find ways to bring water and sanitation into the priority lending sector," he said.
For Mr. Damon, the most challenging part is drumming up awareness and publicity because Americans typically can't relate to the problem of not having access to water. The fact that a child dies every 21 seconds because of lack of access to clean water seems to register with people, the actor said, but he admitted that creating awareness is a hurdle.
"Gary and I are still trying to figure out how to make it land with people," he said. "In America, people have never met anybody who could not go to the kitchen sink for a glass of water."
Clean water and sanitation issues simply do not have the same resonance as war, starvation, malnutrition and other evils that the poor are most vulnerable to.
"Americans can relate to something like HIV/AIDs personally," Mr. Damon said. "You may know people who have HIV, but you don't know any children who died because they had diarrhea in America."
Rather than preaching to the masses, he uses humor to get the message across. So earlier this year, he staged a mock press conference and announced that he was going on a toilet strike until every person in the world had access to clean water and sanitation. The video was part of a well thought-out campaign. Mr. Damon's friends, including Bono and Richard Branson, joined the strike.
"It was very nice of them because mind you, not going to the toilet is very painful," he said.
There is a quiet intensity in Mr. Damon's and Mr. White's determination to expand the reach of Water.org. Theirs is a symbiotic relationship - Mr. White's expertise and Mr. Damon's star power - fueled by their common concern for a problem that affects 780 million people across the world.

HEADLINE: Morning Agenda: Vodafone in Talks Over $115 Billion Deal

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Vodafone has talks over the potential sale of its 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless. | A look at the political checks from hedge fund managers in the New York mayoral race. | The prospect of military action in Syria and its effect on emerging markets. 

 BODY:
The British telecommunications company Vodafone confirmed on Thursday it was in talks over the potential sale of its 45 percent stake in the United States carrier Verizon Wireless, its joint venture with Verizon Communications, DealBook's Mark Scott reports. Analysts have estimated that the stake could be worth more than $115 billion.
The deal would be one of the largest worldwide in the last decade and would end a partnership that started in 1999. In its brief statement on Thursday, Vodafone said there was "no certainty that an agreement will be reached."
"One of the biggest hurdles to the potential deal is the large tax bill Vodafone would have to pay to dispose of its holding in Verizon Wireless," Mr. Scott writes. "Earlier this year, however, Verizon said it could structure any potential transaction to limit Vodafone's tax liabilities." 
HEDGE FUND MANAGERS WRITE SMALL CHECKS IN MAYORAL RACE | Hedge fund giants have turned out to support a Democrat, Christine C. Quinn, with $170,336 in contributions to her campaign for mayor of New York, DealBook's Alexandra Stevenson reports. "Paltry though the sum seems, it is more than twice the amount received by the next closest recipient in the mayoral race, Joseph J. Lhota, a Republican, according to records compiled by the public affairs lobbying organization Common Cause."
The political checks from hedge fund managers are small compared with the sums they invest in the markets, largely because New York law caps individual contributions to mayoral candidates at $4,950. Some of the industry's biggest names are missing from the donors' list altogether, while a few have given amounts as small as $100.
Still, the most politically outspoken include George Soros, chairman of Soros Fund Management, who publicly announced his support for the Democratic front-runner, Bill de Blasio, several weeks ago. Among the donors to Republican candidates is the activist investor Carl C. Icahn. James S. Chanos, founder of Kynikos Associates, put it this way: "It's hard to think how any hedge fund would directly benefit from city politics."
ON THE AGENDA | A revised estimate of growth of gross domestic product in the second quarter is released at 8:30 a.m. Salesforce.com reports earnings after the market closes. W. Edmund Clark, the head of Toronto-Dominion Bank, is on CNBC at 4:30 p.m.
ASIAN MARKETS AND SYRIA CONCERNS | The prospect of military action in Syria caused turmoil in emerging markets on Wednesday and pushed oil prices higher, The New York Times reports. As the White House was contemplating a "limited" attack on Syria, the price of benchmark crude oil jumped from about $107 a barrel at the start of the week to more than $112, before declining to around $110.
"Asian markets have been under pressure for weeks, over fears that the United States Federal Reserve will start tempering its stimulus effort," The Times reports. "Now, investors are worried that rising oil prices could further undermine growth in the region."

HEADLINE: Macroeconomists at War

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The illusion of conversation. 

 BODY:
Simon Wren-Lewis replies to my post on the failure of macroeconomists, and tries to make most of the same points a bit more nicely. In particular, I'm glad to see him acknowledge that macroeconomics only looks like a progressive field if you start your story circa 1980, and ignore all the valid stuff that was tossed out by the RBC school, only to be painfully and partially reintroduced in New Keynesian models. 
But even now, I think that Wren-Lewis is suffering from a bit of what I've come to think of as the Blanchard delusion (sorry, Olivier!): the delusion, widely prevalent on the eve of crisis, that we had in fact reached some kind of resolution of the bitter macroeconomics wars. Wren-Lewis declares that
In 2010, the standard business cycle model was the New Keynesian model, and the implications of that model for the efficacy of appropriately designed fiscal policy are clear.
I guess there's some room for interpretation of the meaning of the word "standard", but it became painfully clear in 2008-2009 that many economists - especially, but not only, at the University of Chicago - not only didn't work in a New Keynesian framework, they were unaware that such a thing existed. As far as they knew, everything Keynesian had been refuted in the 1970s. And as for "the efficacy of appropriately designed fiscal policy" - well, here's John Cochrane:
"It's not part of what anybody has taught graduate students since the 1960s," Cochrane said. "They are fairy tales that have been proved false. It is very comforting in times of stress to go back to the fairy tales we heard as children but it doesn't make them less false."
It would be interesting to know how many graduate departments were in fact teaching New Keynesian macro in 2008. My guess is that a fair number weren't - that students literally had no exposure to the notion that monetary policy, let alone fiscal policy, could play an effective stabilizing role. The notion that we had reached some kind of intellectual detente was, as I said, a delusion: Keynesians had rebuilt their models to make them acceptable to the other side, but the idea that there was any real dialogue was a fantasy.
Now, it is true that New Keynesian models were dominant in policy-oriented research shops - at the various Feds, at the IMF, the Bank of England, etc.. But economists in such places aren't as free to offer independent views as the academics, so the fact that NK was very much not established in the academic world mattered a lot.
Even given all that, it has been remarkable how unwilling many economists whose theoretical framework seems to be more or less Keynesian have been to go with the implications of that framework for fiscal and monetary policy; I think of people like John Taylor and Martin Feldstein. So there are deeper problems. But Wren-Lewis is, I think, too sanguine about the starting point.

HEADLINE: Today in Small Business: Employee Monitoring

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Home sales fall. Mortgage applications fall. How to make employees work harder. 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners today.
Economy

        
The housing recovery loses a step as pending home sales fall.
        
Catherine Clifford explains why the United States remains the dominant force in global entrepreneurship (for now).
        
James Pethokoukis says the nation will need as much as another eight years to restore full employment.
Employees 

        
Derek Thompson asks what makes employees work harder: punishment or pampering? "The bad news: monitoring devices - and, more gruesomely, massive layoffs - really do seem to make us more productive."
Start-Up

        
George Deeb explains why start-up "excubators" offer more benefits than incubators. For example: "An excubator brings its services to the entrepreneur wherever he or she desires to work. It does not require a start-up to relocate its business to the location of the incubator, accelerator or shared location program."
        
Not known for backing tech start-ups, 7-Eleven is investing in Belly, a Chicago start-up with a digital loyalty and rewards platform.
        
Apple is trying to trademark the word "startup."
        
An established entrepreneur starts a new Web site to help small-business owners.
Finance

        
A 22-year-old inventor takes to Kickstarter to finance a lens that can be stuck on cellphone cameras and turn them into a microscope. He may want to turn to this entrepreneur for some advice about succeeding on the crowdfunding site.
        
Proposed changes to the tax code could put the ability of credit unions to lend to small businesses at risk.
        
Mortgage applications fall as rates hit a 2013 high.
Marketing

        
Kara Kamenec demonstrates five ways savvy businesses are targeting prospective customers online: "For example, if you compose a tweet containing the words 'want' and 'computer', technology brands can identify you as a potential customer and may approach you with computer offers."
Around The Country

        
Some California investors who were promised tax breaks for investing in certain types of businesses are receiving hefty tax bills thanks to a recent court ruling that rendered the practice unconstitutional.
        
In Charlotte, N.C., Senator Kay Hagan hosted the first meeting of her Small Business Advisory Committee, where lending, regulatory and work force issues with were discussed.
        
An 11-year-old starts his college career in Texas.
Around The World

        
Yuri Kageyama reports that start-ups are gaining appeal in Japan as big-name Japanese companies fade: "Despite having some of the developed world's least hospitable conditions for starting a business, Japan's 'salaryman' culture of guaranteed lifetime employment at a household name corporation is no longer the unquestioned ideal."
        
China's e-commerce market is expected to leapfrog that of the United States this year to become the world's largest, according to Bain & Company.
Technology

        
Here are a bunch of must-have apps for every trip and a few secret travel hacks the airline industry doesn't want you to know about.
        
Amazon has created a new way for developers to monetize apps.

HEADLINE: Reader Idea | Teaching the American Civil War to Students in China

BYLINE: SHANNON DOYNE


HIGHLIGHT: Students use a Learning Network lesson on primary and secondary sources and the Civil War, do their own research on a key figure, then write blog posts that explain a primary source and its lasting effects on American culture. 

 BODY:
This idea, for using primary sources to help teach about the Civil War, comes from a teacher who works with English-language learners in China.
If you've used The Times for teaching and learning and would like to see your idea on our blog, write in and tell us what you've done.
 Teacher: Margaret Blaha 
 Institution: Shanghai University of Finance and Economics
 Grade Level of Students: Intermediate to advanced English-language students
 Idea: Students use a Learning Network lesson on the Civil War and primary and secondary sources, do their own research on an important figure, then write blog posts that explain a primary source and its lasting effects on American culture. 
 Why We Chose It: This lesson offers an engaging introduction to the vast topic of the Civil War for a 17-week course on Western culture taught in China to English-language college students. Because it teaches skills that could be used with any historical primary source, it is also easily adaptable.
 What Ms. Blaha Did and Why, in Her Own Words 
One of the courses I taught at Shanghai University this year was Western Culture, a course designed to help students better understand American culture by learning about American history and politics. 
I was also expected to help students improve their academic essay writing skills for the GRE/TOEFL/IELTS exams. This is a lot to accomplish in a 17-week semester, especially without any materials or lesson plans. One week I was required to teach the Revolutionary War; the next week, the Civil War, but I felt there was no way to appropriately narrow down these two important conflicts in our nation's history into a bullet-point list that could be highlighted in two class periods. 
So, I decided that my students spoke English well enough that they could teach themselves about the Civil War and write about it. In order to implement these lessons, I turned to The New York Times Learning Network for help.
First, I taught my students the difference between primary and secondary sources. Since these were English-language learners, I provided them the definition for each term and asked them to call out examples of each to confirm that they understood their meaning. Then I moved into the "Saying What's Unsaid" activity from The Learning Network's lesson "Interpreting Civil War-Era Primary Sources." 
I gave each small group a copy of the "Saying What's Unsaid" handout, on which I placed a photograph of one of the following: Abraham Lincoln, Frederick Douglass, John Brown, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant or Gen. Robert E. Lee. The school does not have computers for the students to use, but all of them had Internet-equipped phones, so they were able to look up the people depicted in the pictures and learn all they could about them. 
The next part of the activity required students to write cartoon thought bubbles on their photos, expressing what the person might be thinking, based on what they learned. After sharing their finished posters, we had a brief discussion based on the questions provided in the lesson. 
Because The New York Times is blocked in China and I was unable to use my VPN in the classroom, I couldn't show my students the Disunion blog as the lesson states. 
I still wanted to use a blog, though, and Lapham's Quarterly provided afewexamples of the type of entries I wanted them to write. Their blog entries needed to somehow link their chosen primary source and what it conveyed to American society today, the way articles in Lapham's Quarterly do. 
Students then chose a primary document from the Civil War era from the many examples I gave them. They analyzed the documents closely using the appropriate document analysis sheet. Students then e-mailed me their completed entries to edit and post. 
While my students were at an intermediate to advanced level of fluency in English, their written work required a great deal of editing before it could be published. Several submissions showed evidence of plagiarism, a major problem in Chinese universities, which meant that these students had to rewrite their blog entries. It really became more of a class literary magazine than a blog, with me as its editor. 
I'm proud of how it all turned out. I did something creative with students who have never been expected to think outside the box before.

HEADLINE: Behind the Big Increase in Food Stamps

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Changes in rules and eligibility have contributed to very large increases in the cost of the food stamps program, SNAP, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
The food-stamp program spending grew primarily because of new program rules, and going back to 2007 program rules would yield significant savings for taxpayers.
Something unusual has been happening with the food-stamp program, now known as SNAP, for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. Between 2007 and 2012, spending on SNAP more than doubled, adjusting for inflation and population growth. 
Paul Krugman and others attribute essentially all of the SNAP spending growth to the depressed economy. They have the general direction right - a more depressed economy will cause unemployment and antipoverty programs to spend more - but have missed the single largest factor increasing program budgets: program rules that are more generous now than they were in 2007.
Veterans benefits, Supplemental Security Income, Medicaid and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families all experienced a depressed economy, too, but they somehow managed through it without doubling their spending. Veterans benefits increased the most among these - 49 percent beyond inflation and population growth - compared with 110 percent for SNAP. (These data, which exclude administrative costs, can be found in the Bureau of Economic Analysis' National Accounts Table 3.12.) Even state unemployment benefit spending, which is directly linked to layoffs in the economy, increased "only" 24 percent beyond inflation and population growth.
Peter Ganong and Jeffrey Liebman of Harvard have recently found (see Table 2 in their paper) that seven or eight changes in SNAP eligibility have spread across the states in recent years. They have examined county-level data on SNAP participation and other variables in order to estimate quantitative importance of some these rules. They find that between 2007 and 2011, new eligibility rules by themselves added 3.4 million people to SNAP enrollment and naturally tended to increase SNAP spending. 
Perhaps 3.4 million seems small for a program that enrolled 26 million people before the recession. However, at the same time, SNAP began to pay more generous benefits to people who enrolled. Although changing benefit formulas is not part of Mr. Ganong's and Professor Liebman's paper, the new formulas would have increased SNAP spending more than 25 percent even without any new enrollment. Combined, the spending impact of enrollment and benefit rules is remarkable.
The chart below reports two estimates of the sources of SNAP spending growth: the one on the right, which builds on the Ganong-Liebman enrollment findings, and the one on the left, based on enrollment results I obtained earlier using somewhat different methods. (The Ganong-Liebman paper does not attempt to measure the combined effect of new benefit and eligibility rules between 2007 and 2011). The vertical axis measures the increase in SNAP program spending between 2007 and 2011, measured in 2007 dollars per American per year. All Americans are in the denominator - not just those who participate in SNAP - so that more participation in SNAP increases spending measured this way.
The total increase is $112 per person per year. Part, but not all, of the $112 can be attributed to more generous benefit formulas and more inclusive eligibility rules. That part is shown in red. My estimates say that, without a depressed economy, inflation-adjusted SNAP spending per capita would have increased $77 because SNAP rules changed. Using the enrollment estimates of Mr. Ganong and Professor Liebman together with the changes in benefit formulas suggests the increase would have been $53.
The remaining or unexplained spending increase is potentially attributable to the depressed economy, although it could be attributable to changes in the conduct of the SNAP that have not yet been quantified. For example, the Department of Agriculture has perennially attributed some of the increase in program participation to its outreach efforts - that is, advertising, promotional and other activities that encourage eligible people to join the SNAP program. Mr. Ganong and Professor Liebman note that enrollment itself may react to more generous benefits, as high benefits are likely to have encouraged more households to participate. These are effects that should be included in the red area in the chart but have been left as part of the blue "unexplained" area because of the lack of quantitative estimates.
The United States had a food stamp program before the recession that automatically included more households as circumstances put their incomes near or below the poverty line. The newest estimates suggest that going back to the 2007 SNAP program rules would annually save taxpayers at least $53 per American - that's $212 for every family of four - and put SNAP spending back in line with spending on other antipoverty programs.

HEADLINE: Chinese Students Bolster U.S. College Budgets

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The number of foreign students at American colleges has risen to more than 764,000, an increase of roughly 200,000 in less than six years, Washington Monthly reports, and the bulk of the net increase has come from China. 

 BODY:
Washington Monthly's annual college issue usually has some fascinating material, and this year is no exception. One example is an article by Paul Stephens on the sharp rise in foreign students on American campuses (to more than 764,000, an increase of roughly 200,000 in less than six years, he says, citing data from the Institute of International Education and the State Department). Many are from wealthy overseas families paying full tuition - and helping to bolster college budgets. 
Where are the students coming from? By this reckoning, the bulk of the net increase - more than 160,000 of the 200,000 - has come from China. 
 Mr. Stephens writes:
While administrators promote the diversity and global perspectives these new students bring to campus, it's clear that such high-minded goals are not the only motivation for enrolling large numbers of foreign students. With state spending on higher education declining sharply over the last five years - it's down an average of 28 percent nationwide - out-of-state and international students who pay full tuition (and sometimes even additional tuition) have kept these institutions in the black. As state assemblies have cut back, the people of China have picked up the tab.

HEADLINE: Mayoral Endorsements, From Our Readers

BYLINE: LAWRENCE DOWNES


HIGHLIGHT: Times commenters back BIll de Blasio for New York City mayor. 

 BODY:
On Sunday, when The Times editorial board endorsed Christine Quinn in the Democratic primary campaign for mayor of New York (and Joseph Lhota in the Republican race), we invited readers to weigh in with their own endorsements - who was their choice, and why?
So far, Bill de Blasio is winning that contest, hands-down. As of Thursday, we have published 502 comments, with the overwhelming majority supporting Mr. de Blasio. Readers like his message about battling inequality, his campaign's major theme. Many are simply pleased that he is not Ms. Quinn.
I support the candidate who I believe has the middle class most firmly in his vision for NYC!
- Kate From Manhattan 
De Blasio's continued commitment to keeping inequality front-and-center is inspiring and important. As Bloomberg showed us, the mayor of NY plays an important role in shaping local, national, and even international civic discourse (look at how many times Bloomberg has been in The Economist), and we need someone who truly "gets" how important social justice and economic mobility is. Over the last six years I have watched my adopted city make amazing progress on so many fronts, but I have also seen more and more New Yorkers pushed to the sides, completely unable to afford to participate in the "new and improved" New York. A playground for the world's rich is nice to look at and visit, but soul-crushing to live in.
- Jesse B From Manhattan
The difference between Quinn and de Blasio is that Quinn talks about the "middle class" while de Blasio talks about the "rich" and "poor." Frankly, de Blasio's terms better describe who we are as a city. Look at the census data for 2010: what you see is truly a "tale of two cities," as de Blasio says. Mayor Quinn will coddle the rich, but who will speak for the poor, the homeless, the unemployed, the marginalized? We need Bill de Blasio.
- Gregory From Manhattan
I am tired of seeing neighborhood after neighborhood of NYC being turned into elite enclaves that only the megawealthy can afford, and I refer not only to Manhattan. Christine Quinn is unquestionably in the pockets of real estate developers and believes that such development is the hallmark of a city's allure. There is much more to life than luxury - or simply very expensive - housing. Furthermore, Ms. Quinn did nothing - absolutely to nothing - to try halt the closure of St. Vincent's, a vital, if financially troubled, centerpiece of Lower Manhattan. Bill de Blasio represents an important step in returning NY to a city of vibrant, varied, and accessible life. - Gary Giardina From Manhattan
Some readers couldn't get past Quinn's support for Bloomberg's third term and wanted to support someone completely different.
Bill de Blasio will be best for NY, but frankly I'll vote for Anyone But Quinn.
 - Ivy From Queens
Quinn can never be forgiven for enabling Bloomberg's third term- against the law and against the repeatedly expressed will of New Yorkers. Good riddance to the pair of them. Looking forward to NYC that is once again not just about rampant overdevelopment and moneyed interests, but a vibrant and livable place for all of us!
 - Anonymous From Queens
In terms of vision - where the city should be four years from now - Mr. de Blasio is head and shoulders above the others. Ms. Quinn and Mr. Thompson are both intelligent, hard-working and truly committed to doing what's best for the most New Yorkers possible. But, from my perspective, they represent the past. Ms. Quinn's comment that she would want to keep Comm. Kelly in place, is a good example.
 - Anthony N From Manhattan
Ms. Quinn does have her supporters:
Chris Quinn has not promised the world because she knows we can't pay for it. I like her practical approach. The other serious candidates promise the world. I am not interested in unlimited promises, but a working, thriving city. She can do the job. And, she speaks for herself and has since becoming speaker. I don't think the other candidates do the same.
 - Anonymous From Manhattan
I believe Christine Quinn is the "whole package" in that she has a much better handle on the mulch-faceted needs of the City and also facing the City. Ms. Quinn has shown the ability, competence, business knowledge, and gravitas required. She has a vision for this City, and is a New Yorker through and through, wanting what's best for New York and I believe she's the only one of the candidates who can accomplish the bettering of the City. She's not waging decades old battles, she's only looking forward.
- K Carroll From Bronx
I think she's the only candidate who can plausibly wrangle all of New York City's various interests and actually accomplish something at the end of the day.
- Andrew From Brooklyn
Of the Republican candidates, Mr. Lhota received the most reader endorsements.
Let's just get this over with and elect someone with experience running the city. Joe Lhota is even tempered, analytical and even personable. He has integrity and has shown willingness to roll up his sleeves on behalf of his hometown. I don't usually vote for Republican but the Democrats aren't leaving me any choice. Vote Joe.
- Clara From Queens
Why Lhota? Because Rome wasn't built in a day. That, however, is what the rest of the candidates are proposing. Joe Lhota's a realist. He knows that you can't fix every single problem in New York just by throwing money at it because New York doesn't have money to throw. Yet the democrats propose spending on huge projects: a new position in the police, replacing textbooks with tablets, more housing. Great ideas, yes. But how do we pay for them? Quinn doesn't want to raise taxes? Where, exactly, is she going to get money to pay for a tablet for every student in EVERY school? De Blasio will raise taxes on the rich, but the same thing will happen in New York as in France: the rich will leave. So who will pay then? Lhota has simple, realistic ideas that will make the city money. Money first, ideas later
 - Mike From Staten Island
Of all the candidates its Joe Lhota best combines the skills necessary for an executive position such as mayor, a job that truly is part politician and part CEO. Lhota is not a bureaucrat or professional politician like much of the democratic field, yet can draw on years of public sector experience. Similarly Lhota is not a career businessman like Catsimatidis but still has valuable private sector experience at companies important to New York's economy. Its this unique combination of public and private sector experience that qualifies Lhota as the city's next mayor.
 - Nick From Brooklyn
In terms of the issues, cost of living seemed to concern most of living seemed to concern most of the readers (71 picked that topic), along with policing and civil rights (43), schools (38), jobs (38), housing (38) and poverty (37).
Bill de Blasio believes in quality for all New Yorkers. He's right when he says New York must be a city that everyone can afford to live in.
- trina From Bronx (Cost of Living)
[John Liu] is the only one of bunch who believes that "stop and frisk" should be ended completely. That the NYTs could support Quinn who loves Ray Kelly and this racist policy is truly outrageous!
 - Teri From Brooklyn (Policing and Civil Rights)
I've got 2 children in the NYC public school system, so I'm pretty much a single issue voter right now. Bill de Blasio also has kids in the system. It's clear that he has an understanding of how Bloomberg's reforms are actually working on the ground, i.e., too much high stakes testing and a stressful and complex 'choice' system that doesn't seem to be leveling the playing field (the schools get the choice, not the kids and families). He's got my vote.
 - Laura From Brooklyn (Schools)
Lhota knows what the city needs to compete globally, and to give taxpayers the best return on their money: 1) quality public services provided in a cost efficient manner 2) a growing economy that provides more and better private sector jobs 3) real continued focus on crime reduction 4) better accountability of teachers under the city's payroll None of the Republican or Democratic candidates have shown a similar knowledge of best practices, nor a willingness to act in the taxpayer's best interest.

HIGHLIGHT: The 2014 Honda Odyssey minivan gets the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&#8217;s highest rating, and Ford offers bacon-wrapped Fiestas. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 The 2014 Honda Odyssey has become the first minivan to receive the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety's highest safety rating, Top Safety Pick+, the group said in a release on Thursday. It is also the first minivan that the group has run through its small overlap crash test. The group said that although the Odyssey looked the same as past models, Honda strengthened the passenger compartment and improved the side-curtain air bags without significant changes in the vehicle's weight. Of the 20 Honda and Acura models the group has tested, six have garnered Top Safety Pick+ status: the 2-door and 4-door Honda Accord, the 2-door and 4-door Civic, the Odyssey and the Acura TL. (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) 
 Toyota said it was planning some major changes for the 2015 Prius, according to Green Car Reports. A larger interior, lighter weight, an improved trailing arm rear suspension and an increase in combined fuel economy to 55 miles per gallon are among the improvements promised by the automaker. Toyota also said the hybrid car, which it plans to build in the United States, will have a more efficient gasoline engine and more powerful electric motors.(Green Car Reports)
 A company accused by Edmunds.com of posting fraudulent auto dealership reviews on its Web site has agreed to stop posting on Edmunds.com, cease registering accounts permanently and pay for a part of Edmunds' legal fees as part of a settlement. Edmunds filed suit against Humankind Design Limited, based in Friendswood, Tex., when it came to light that about 2,200 accounts created on Edmunds.com were giving nothing but positive reviews to more than two dozen dealerships. Humankind advertises itself as a "reputation management" company, promising to promote dealerships' online images. (Automotive News)
 International Bacon Day is this Saturday, and to celebrate, Ford is offering a bacon-wrapped Fiesta. Don't worry, it's not real bacon. Along with the full bacon body wrap, which plasters images of 10 giant strips of bacon on the car, Ford will also have available bacon racing strips - placed in the standard location that racing stripes are found - and a side of bacon, which will feature bacon strips over the rear wheels. Ford worked with Benton's Country Hams on this rather odd marketing scheme. (Ford)

HEADLINE: Putting Labor Back in Labor Day

BYLINE: TERESA TRITCH


HIGHLIGHT: Fast food corporations benefit from the status quo. Their workers don&#8217;t. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re going on strike. 

 BODY:
The fast food strikes that began last November in New York City with walkouts by 200 workers expanded and spread to other cities in the spring and summer. On Thursday, thousands of workers in 60 cities went on a one-day strike. The demands were the same, only amplified - higher pay, to $15 an hour, and the right to organize without retaliation.
There are many reasons to support the strikers. There's the still resonant goal - expressed by those who marched on Washington 50 years ago - of ensuring that work leads to a decent standard of living. That's not achievable at today's federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, or at the typical wage for fast food workers, about $9.00 an hour. If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation over the past 50 years, it would be about $10 an hour today. If it had kept pace with the growth in average labor productivity, it would be about $17 an hour. Split the difference and you are not far from what the strikers are calling for. 
Another reason to support the strikers is economic self-interest. The low wages of fast food workers - and of workers in retail, home care and other low-wage industries - force many of them onto food stamps and other public assistance to get by. Taxpayers step up with aid because employers don't pay enough.

There's also the fact that fast food corporations - McDonald's, Yum Brands (which includes Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC), Wendy's - can afford to pay more. The chief executives of McDonald's and Yum are among the nation's highest paid bosses. Wendy's profits have been soaring lately. The corporations invariably say that individual franchisees set wages and franchisees say they can't afford to pay more without raising prices, which they say would drive away customers and lead to job loss. But wages aren't the franchisees' only cost. They also pay rent and royalties to their corporate bosses. How about lowering those costs to create room for raises?
Of course such changes would lead to lower profits and that would translate into lower executive pay and lower shareholder returns. But we're talking about big,profitable companies, which are big and profitable in part because they rely on underpaid labor.
The second part of the strikers' demands - the right to unionize without retaliation - goes hand in hand with the call for higher pay
Unionization is what improved compensation and working conditions in factories in the last century, transforming underpaid laborers into the middle class.
Even as the share of American workers in unions fell to its lowest levels in nearly a century, full-time unionized workers still made considerably more than non-union workers, with median weekly wages in 2012 of $943 and $742, respectively, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics.
There's no intrinsic reason that service jobs at profitable corporations, say, in restaurants and big box stores, should pay so little. What is missing today is employee bargaining power, which unionization provides, so that the growth in labor productivity flows more to wages and salary and less to executive salaries and shareholder returns.
Corporations benefit from the status quo. Workers don't. That's why they want a new bargain. Happy Labor Day.

HEADLINE: Toxic Populi

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The digital village square is the marketplace of ideas. But what if that marketplace looks like the &#8220;Star Wars&#8221; bar &#8212; or worse? 

 BODY:
By now, most people have heard something about Delbert Belton, known as Shorty, the World War II veteran beaten to death last week in a parking lot of the town where I grew up, Spokane, Wash. At age 88, Belton was the Greatest Generation in a five-foot frame: he survived the Battle of Okinawa and worked 30 years in the cauldron of the local aluminum plant, only to get his head bashed in by couple of thugs in search of his wallet, as police reported.
What happened after Shorty's death - a spasm of hate from the coward's bunker of the Internet and the media forces that prosper by stoking that hatred - shows why it may be impossible to have any kind of "conversation" about race in the age of kinetic connection. 
The high road, those stirring speeches in commemoration of the 1963 March on Washington, was on display Wednesday. No matter what you think of Barack Obama, his presidency is a historic rebuke to America's original sin of enslaving people by race. The low road, digital communities of bigots reinforced by a few prominent media figures, was all too evident in the days following Belton's killing.
Shorty Belton was white. The two teenagers arrested in his murder are black. When the Drudge Report, Rush Limbaugh and Fox News - the troglodyte trio - saw this story, it went from an all-too-common tale of urban violence to a politicized narrative and magnet for racists. 
The Spokane newspaper, The Spokesman-Review, had to shut down the comments section on its Web site because the stream was so thick with anti-black and anti-Obama sewage. A columnist for the paper, Shawn Vestal, was stunned to see his town become a casualty in the race version of the culture wars.

"What happened to Belton was horrible," Vestal wrote. "And what happened to him in death - as his name was taken up cynically for political fodder in the world of bloviation and dog-whistle racism - was horrible in a different way."
But don't take the word of a newspaper columnist. The Spokane police chief, Frank Straub, said, "There is no indication that there is any racial motivation whatsoever" in the crime. More significant, he said, is that two young people thought it was O.K. to beat an old man to death.
Limbaugh went after Obama for refusing to draw attention to a crime committed by "thug-wannabe African-Americans." Fox News tried desperately to make the killing a racial incident, even when a family member of the victim pushed back against a series of suggestive questions. "If I could say this to everybody: stop making this about race," said Allen Hills, a great-nephew of Shorty, during an interview on "Fox and Friends." "This isn't about race. It's about two punk kids."
Spokane is one of the whitest cities in America; just over 2 percent of its 209,000 residents are black. But the town elected a black mayor in the past and has a long tradition of resistance to the pockets of hard-core racists in its midst. Most of the hatred, judging by the thousands of Web comments, came from outside the city, driven by the aforementioned media ringleaders.
The same thing happened in Oklahoma after a white, Australian baseball player, 22-year-old Christopher Lane, was shot in the back while jogging. Three teens were arrested for the murder, two of them black. Lane was killed, in the narrative stoked by conservative media, because he was white - and thousands of Web commenters picked up the thread. Does it matter that the lead prosecutor in the case said race was not a factor?
The teens, according to police, were "bored" and just "decided to kill somebody." There's the sickness, and it's not specific to skin color. These Oklahoma teens also worshiped guns, and the former deputy prime minister of Australia Tim Fischer blamed the "gun culture" of the United States for "corrupting the world." President Obama, in a statement of condolence on the Lane killing, noted there is "an extra measure of evil in an act of violence that cuts a young life short." 
It is much easier to incite racial fear than to try to examine the mechanics of evil. Yes, blacks commit a disproportionate amount of the homicides in this country, and are disproportionate among the victims. Is that because of their race? Enough people believe so, and will use any crime with a white victim and a black assailant to press their point. 
From the beginning of Obama's time in office, when Glenn Beck said the president "has a deep-seated hatred for white people," to the present-day, right-wing media figures have played their own kind of race card. Just last month, Limbaugh accused Obama of promoting "racial strife" for daring to talk about how blacks view the Trayvon Martin case through a different lens than whites. "He's got a chip on his shoulder about it," said Limbaugh on the president and race, "and he's here to square the deal." 
The Web is the other big factor. The digital village square, in free-speech theory, is the marketplace of ideas. But what if the marketplace looks like the "Star Wars" bar - or worse? After reading the comments on another racially charged story in Colorado a few weeks ago, someone wrote on the Fox 31-Denver Web site that it was like being a fly on the wall at "an Alabama Klan rally."
The only way to kill those rallies, it appears, is to kill or modify the forum, as The Huffington Post will soon be doing. "Trolls are just getting more and more aggressive and uglier," said Arianna Huffington, in explaining a plan to get rid of anonymous comments and try to encourage "the grown-up Internet." 
Our better angels, in Lincoln's magnificent phrase, usually don't hang around the troll fests or listen to Limbaugh. You saw them at the Washington Mall on Wednesday, trying to elevate a conversation about our national character. Too bad they were preaching to the choir.

HEADLINE: In New Wave of Walkouts, Fast-Food Strikers Gain Momentum

BYLINE: STEVEN GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: A growing wave of one-day strikes has put a youthful face on a campaign to substantially improve the pay of fast-food workers, and the industry is pushing back. 

 BODY:
As a wave of one-day walkouts by fast-food workers gains momentum in a push for a $15 hourly wage, the movement has been notable both for the prominence of young faces and for the audacity of their demand. 
On Thursday, the protests involved workers at nearly 1,000 restaurants in more than 50 cities, organizers said, spreading to areas of the South and West including Atlanta, Los Angeles, Memphis, and Raleigh, N.C. 
The Service Employees International Union has provided financial support to the one-day walkouts since they began a month ago at restaurants of McDonald's, Burger King and other chains in seven cities. Many and perhaps most of the workers have been in their 20s.
Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor and labor expert at the University of Washington, said the strikes could elevate the union movement's standing among younger workers who have grown up in an era when unions have steadily lost membership and power. 
"It should reinforce the labor movement as something new and relevant to the young workers of today," Professor Rosenfeld said. And pointing to the use of the Internet to spread the strike call, he added, "The combination of old and new organizing strategies really seems to have paid off here." 
But even with the attention the strikes have drawn, the big question remains whether the walkouts can achieve any traction on the main demand - the wage increase to $15 an hour in an industry in which many of the 2.3 million fast food workers earn the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour.
Arne Kalleberg, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina and author of the book "Good Jobs, Bad Jobs," said: "The strikes are an indication of a great frustration that's been building up over a long time. It reflects the fact that people are really concerned with increasing inequality."
One such frustrated worker was Roberto Tejada, who earns $8 an hour at a Taco Bell in Los Angeles. "People can't survive on the minimum wage," he said. "Nobody who works full time should live in poverty."
Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez has pointed to the strikes as evidence that the federal minimum wage should be increased. President Obama hasproposed a $9 minimum wage, but many Republicans have denounced the idea, saying it would eliminate jobs.
Steve Caldeira, president of the International Franchise Association, warned that a raise to $15 an hour would hurt franchisees - and would result in less hiring. "Mandating increased wages would lead to higher prices for consumers, lower foot traffic" and lost jobs, he said.
And a corporate-backed group, the Employment Policies Institute, ran a full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal, saying that a $15 wage would mean "fewer entry-level jobs and more automated alternatives - even in the kitchen."
The strike's organizers have had feverish discussions - including a meeting with academics in Las Vegas - to figure out how to attain their goal. One idea is to persuade city councils to pass a $15-an-hour minimum wage for fast-food workers. Another is not to hit up hard-pressed franchisees for the raises, but instead to get the chains to channel some of the fees they obtain from franchises into higher wages.
Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, said the expansion of the strikes was helping to persuade government officials and community groups that the demand was not unrealistic. 
"It's moving people to understand that $15 is increasingly reasonable," she said. "It's becoming crystal clear to a lot of people that if these workers who earn $9,000 a year could earn $18,000, that could make a big change in their neighborhoods."
But Professor Kalleberg acknowledged that the chains would not be so easily persuaded.
"You'll have to put consumer pressure on the companies," he said. "The consumer is the lever here. I don't know how about $15. Obama is having a problem getting to $9. I think something in between may be realistic."

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Hiring Put China's Elite on an Easy Track

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: A hiring program intended to weed out nepotism in the bank&#8217;s China operations instead has led to a federal bribery investigation in the United States, interviews and a government document show. 

 BODY:
The program was originally called "Sons and Daughters." And although it was supposed to protect JPMorgan Chase's business dealings in China, the program went so off track that it is now the focus of a federal bribery investigation in the United States, interviews and a confidential government document show.
JPMorgan started the program in 2006 as the friends and family of China's ruling elite were clamoring for jobs at the bank, according to the interviews with former bank employees and financial executives in China and the United States. The program's existence, which has not been previously reported, suggests that the bank's hiring of such employees was widespread.
 Saying they wanted to weed out nepotism and avoid bribery charges in the United States, JPMorgan employees in Asia started the program to hire well-connected candidates on a separate track from ordinary applicants, the employees and executives said. Without the program and its heightened scrutiny of the candidates, the employees argued, JPMorgan might improperly hire the children of Chinese officials to win business. 
But in the months and years that followed, the two-tiered process that could have prevented questionable hiring practices instead fostered them, according to the interviews as well as the confidential government document. Applicants from prominent Chinese families, interviews show, often faced few job interviews and relaxed standards. While many candidates met or exceeded the bank's requirements, some had subpar academic records and lacked relevant expertise.
JPMorgan, which declined to comment, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. And no one has indicated that the children of Chinese officials helped the bank secure business deals. Furthermore, public documents do not offer a concrete link between the bank's hiring practices and its ability to secure business deals.
Yet, according to the interviews, which were conducted on the condition of anonymity, JPMorgan employees in Asia recognized the benefit of hiring Chinese officials' children. In an internal document, the employees linked the hires to the "revenue" JPMorgan obtained from companies run by those same officials.
It is unclear why and when the "Sons and Daughters" program shifted from a safeguard into a liability. But the results were clear: Children with elite pedigrees faced lower standards. In one instance, according to the interviews, the bank continued to employ the son of Tang Shuangning, the chairman of a state-controlled financial conglomerate, even though some JPMorgan officials questioned the younger Mr. Tang's financial expertise.
The son, whose résumé included impressive stints at other global banks, is one of two former JPMorgan employees to surface in an antibribery investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to the confidential agency document sent to the bank and reviewed by The New York Times. The S.E.C. document - a May 2013 letter to JPMorgan that outlined the scope of the agency's inquiry - sought "documents sufficient to identify all persons involved in the decision to hire" the employees.
The S.E.C. did not inquire about the daughter of Ning Gaoning, the chairman of China's giant state run food company, Cofco. However, according to a review of securities filings and public records, she was an intern at JPMorgan during the summer of 2012. JPMorgan won business from Cofco, or a subsidiary, before she joined the bank. Yet after she arrived, a subsidiary of Cofco also hired JPMorgan to advise on its plan to raise about $580 million through an issuance of shares, a deal that could draw interest from the S.E.C.
The S.E.C. is coordinating its civil investigation with federal prosecutors and the F.B.I., officials said on Thursday, though the criminal authorities have not yet contacted the bank. Hong Kong authorities are also investigating the hiring practices, according to people briefed on the matter.
According to the interviews, an internal JPMorgan investigation into its hiring practices across the globe has so far identified more than 250 well-connected hires in Asia alone. That number included the sons and daughters of private Chinese companies, a hiring practice that would not violate United States law but could cause regulatory problems overseas.
At the heart of the S.E.C.'s investigation is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which essentially bans United States companies from giving "anything of value" to a foreign official to win "an improper advantage" in retaining business.
According to legal experts, there is nothing inherently improper about hiring well-connected people. To run afoul of the law, a company must act with "corrupt" intent, or with the expectation of offering a job in exchange for government business.
It is unclear whether the S.E.C. will find such a link in JPMorgan's case. Still, according to securities filings and the confidential S.E.C. document, some of the bank's hiring came at an opportune time.
One striking example was the hiring of Tang Xiaoning, whose father is the chairman of the China Everbright Group, the state-controlled financial conglomerate.
Before the hiring in 2010, the bank's business with China Everbright was limited, if not nonexistent, based on a review of securities filings and news reports. Since then, though, JPMorgan won a steady flow of business. In 2011, China Everbright's banking subsidiary picked JPMorgan as one of 12 financial advisers on its decision to become a public company, a common move in China for businesses affiliated with the government. While that deal was delayed amid global economic turmoil and questions about China's banking system, JPMorgan has since secured other coveted business from China Everbright.
In 2012, for example, JPMorgan was the sole bank hired to advise China Everbright International, a subsidiary focused on alternative energy businesses, on a $162 million sale of shares, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ, a research service. JPMorgan also advised the China Everbright Group on its role in what was, according to the research firm Dealogic, the largest-ever private equity deal in China.
With those relationships in mind, the S.E.C. asked the bank for "all documents" relating to the younger Mr. Tang's "recruitment, hiring" and application.
The S.E.C. is also examining the hiring of Zhang Xixi, whose father is Zhang Shuguang, the former deputy chief engineer of China's railway ministry. She joined JPMorgan around 2007. In the months and years to come, the bank nestled closer to the railways business in China.
The government agency has never hired JPMorgan directly, securities filings and news reports suggest. Still those records indicate that the China Railway Group, the construction company whose largest customer is thought to be the Chinese government, picked JPMorgan to advise it on plans to become a public company in 2007.
JPMorgan scored desired business about four years later when Ms. Zhang was an associate at the bank. The operator of a high-speed railway from Beijing to Shanghai picked the bank to guide it through its own initial public stock offering, according to news reports. In the S.E.C. document, the agency requested that JPMorgan turn over documents related to the public offering.
Ms. Zhang's father, the document noted, was detained on suspicion of corruption. To date, he has not been prosecuted.

HEADLINE: Mom Comes Home With a Stripper

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:
''How can I complain? Women in Darfur walk 14 miles to get water and are raped on the way.''
That reflection, intended to pre-empt accusations that the speaker is a spoiled self-absorbed ninny oblivious to the suffering of others, is offered by Rachel (Kathryn Hahn of ''Parks of Recreation'') directly to the camera in the opening moments of Jill Soloway's uneasy comedy ''Afternoon Delight.'' Rachel is a discontented wife and mother who lives in the affluent Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles with her husband, Jeff (Josh Radnor), and young son, Logan (Sawyer Ever).
Jeff has made a pile inventing apps, and the family lives in tasteful splendor. Rachel's social life revolves around her gabby circle of friends from the Jewish Community Center, who busy themselves arranging benefits for this or that cause. Rachel, who studied journalism in college and took an unrewarding public relations job, is unemployed. 
Her malaise comes down to that usual marital complaint, a lack of sex. She and Jeff have only done it once in the past six months, she complains to her abrasively bossy therapist, Dr. Lenore (Jane Lynch). The doctor boastfully holds up her own lesbian relationship as a paragon of coupled bliss. When Rachel complains too much, Dr. Lenore suggests that they increase the frequency of her appointments. Jeff treats Rachel's mood swings with a tolerant condescension, slightly rolling his eyes and looking away glumly.
The yada-yada exchanged by Rachel and her girlfriends feels uncomfortably authentic, as if it were transcribed from a concealed recorder. So do the evasive conversations of Jeff and Rachel, for whom it is never exactly the right time for sexual intimacy. Whether or not you wince, this meticulously acted movie, which won Ms. Soloway a directing award at the Sundance Film Festival, paints an accurate picture of how a segment of youngish, educated, affluent, white Americans converse. It is anything but inspiring.
At the suggestion of a friend, Rachel and Jeff visit a strip club to absorb its erotic buzz and bring it home. She accepts a lap dance from McKenna (Juno Temple), a frizzy-haired 20-year-old blonde and self-described ''full-service sex worker.'' Returning later to the club, she sees McKenna on the street, reintroduces herself and strikes up an acquaintance. Discovering that McKenna is between apartments, Rachel invites her home and impulsively suggests she stay on as a nanny. She has a vague idea of ''rescuing'' McKenna from a degrading life.
The free-spirited McKenna is the movie's most compelling and likable character. Sweet-natured and frisky, she lives from day to day, neither judging herself nor others but letting it be known that she comes from a rough background. A scene in which she brings Rachel along on a date with one of her regular johns, a stout middle-aged man with whom McKenna is sweetly cuddly, reveals the difference between the two women. If Rachel fancies herself a bohemian playgirl, she shrinks in revulsion when given the opportunity to participate.
Although the movie does a good job of differentiating Rachel's gal pals, they are different versions of the same tense, articulate, hard-edge modern woman. When under the influence, they talk about their fantasies -- Michael Fassbender leads the list -- but they are basically prim, well-behaved spouses whose wild college years are well behind them. Having settled for a comfortable life, they are not about to take any serious risks.
Because this talky, uncinematic movie portrays bourgeois Los Angeles as peopled by bored, yammering wives whose husbands are happier playing cards or sports than spending time with them, it is easy to view them as smarter, wittier, less narcissistic equivalents of ''The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills'' minus cosmetic surgery. Even so, by the end of ''Afternoon Delight,'' you find yourself mulling over a nagging question: Is that all there is? Could be.
''Afternoon Delight'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian) for strong, sometimes graphic sexual content, language and some drug use.
Afternoon Delight
Opens on Friday in New York and Los Angeles.
Written and directed by Jill Soloway; director of photography, Jim Frohna; edited by Catherine Haight; music by Craig Wedren; production design by Adriana Serrano; costumes by Marie Schley; produced by Jen Chaiken and Sebastian Dungan; released by the Film Arcade. Running time: 1 hour 33 minutes.

HEADLINE: For China Elite, JPMorgan Jobs On Easy Track

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
The program was originally called ''Sons and Daughters.'' And although it was supposed to protect JPMorgan Chase's business dealings in China, the program went so off track that it is now the focus of a federal bribery investigation in the United States, interviews and a confidential government document show.
JPMorgan started the program in 2006 as the friends and family of China's ruling elite were clamoring for jobs at the bank, according to the interviews with former bank employees and financial executives in China and the United States. The program's existence, which has not been previously reported, suggests that the bank's hiring of such employees was widespread.
Saying they wanted to weed out nepotism and avoid bribery charges in the United States, JPMorgan employees in Asia started the program to hire well-connected candidates on a separate track from ordinary applicants, the employees and executives said. Without the program and its heightened scrutiny of the candidates, the employees argued, JPMorgan might improperly hire the children of Chinese officials to win business. 
But in the months and years that followed, the two-tiered process that could have prevented questionable hiring practices instead fostered them, according to the interviews as well as the confidential government document. Applicants from prominent Chinese families, interviews show, often faced few job interviews and relaxed standards. While many candidates met or exceeded the bank's requirements, some had subpar academic records and lacked relevant expertise.
JPMorgan, which declined to comment, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. And no one has indicated that the children of Chinese officials helped the bank secure business deals. Furthermore, public documents do not offer a concrete link between the bank's hiring practices and its ability to secure business deals.
Yet, according to the interviews, which were conducted on the condition of anonymity, JPMorgan employees in Asia recognized the benefit of hiring Chinese officials' children. In an internal document, the employees linked the hires to the ''revenue'' JPMorgan obtained from companies run by those same officials.
It is unclear why and when the ''Sons and Daughters'' program shifted from a safeguard into a liability. But the results were clear: Children with elite pedigrees faced lower standards. In one instance, according to the interviews, the bank continued to employ the son of Tang Shuangning, the chairman of a state-controlled financial conglomerate, even though some JPMorgan officials questioned the younger Mr. Tang's financial expertise.
The son, whose résumé included impressive stints at other global banks, is one of two former JPMorgan employees to surface in an antibribery investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to the confidential agency document sent to the bank and reviewed by The New York Times. The S.E.C. document -- a May 2013 letter to JPMorgan that outlined the scope of the agency's inquiry -- sought ''documents sufficient to identify all persons involved in the decision to hire'' the employees.
The S.E.C. did not inquire about the daughter of Ning Gaoning, the chairman of China's giant state run food company, Cofco. However, according to a review of securities filings and public records, she was an intern at JPMorgan during the summer of 2012. JPMorgan won business from Cofco, or a subsidiary, before she joined the bank. Yet after she arrived, a subsidiary of Cofco also hired JPMorgan to advise on its plan to raise about $580 million through an issuance of shares, a deal that could draw interest from the S.E.C.
The S.E.C. is coordinating its civil investigation with federal prosecutors and the F.B.I., officials said on Thursday, though the criminal authorities have not yet contacted the bank. Hong Kong authorities are also investigating the hiring practices, according to people briefed on the matter.
According to the interviews, an internal JPMorgan investigation into its hiring practices across the globe has so far identified more than 250 well-connected hires in Asia alone. That number included the sons and daughters of private Chinese companies, a hiring practice that would not violate United States law but could cause regulatory problems overseas.
At the heart of the S.E.C.'s investigation is the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which essentially bans United States companies from giving ''anything of value'' to a foreign official to win ''an improper advantage'' in retaining business.
According to legal experts, there is nothing inherently improper about hiring well-connected people. To run afoul of the law, a company must act with ''corrupt'' intent, or with the expectation of offering a job in exchange for government business.

HEADLINE: New Neighbor's Agenda: White Power Takeover

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON

 BODY:
LEITH, N.D. -- The bearded man with thinning, gray-and-bleach-blond hair flapping down his neck first appeared in this tiny agricultural town last year, quietly and inconspicuously roaming the crackly dirt roads.
Nettie Ketterling thought nothing of it when he came into her bar to charge his cellphone in an outlet beneath the mounted head of a mule deer. To Kenneth Zimmerman, the man was just another customer, bringing his blue Dodge Durango in for repairs. Bobby Harper did not blink when the man appeared in front of his house and asked him if he had any land to sell. And the mayor, Ryan Schock, was simply extending a civic courtesy when he swung by the man's house to introduce himself.
Their new neighbor, they thought, was just another person looking to get closer to the lucrative oil fields in western North Dakota known as the Bakken.
But all that changed last week. 
The Southern Poverty Law Center and The Bismarck Tribune revealed that the man, Paul Craig Cobb, 61, has been buying up property in this town of 24 people in an effort to transform it into a colony for white supremacists.
In the past two years, Mr. Cobb, a longtime proselytizer for white supremacy who is wanted in Canada on charges of promoting hatred, has bought a dozen plots of land in Leith (pronounced Leeth) and has sold or transferred ownership of some of them to a couple of like-minded white nationalists.
He is using Craigslist and white power message boards to entice others in the movement to take refuge in Leith, about two hours southwest of Bismarck. On one board, he detailed his vision for the community -- an enclave where residents fly ''racialist'' banners, where they are able to import enough ''responsible hard core'' white nationalists to take control of the town government, where ''leftist journalists or antis'' who ''come and try to make trouble'' will face arrest.
The revelations have riveted this community and the surrounding area, drawing a range of reactions from disgust to disbelief to curiosity.
''If that man wanted to live in Leith and be a good neighbor and be decent and not push his thoughts on the people, then he could live there,'' said Arlene Wells, 82, a farmer and local historian. ''But to come in and want to change everything and be the big dog -- no. I don't like bulldogs.''
It is all people are talking about, in bars and in their homes, at funerals and at church. They are poking around on the Web to read Mr. Cobb's positions for themselves. A stream of cars creep through the streets where horses occasionally trot, their passengers hoping to catch a glimpse of some action or take a peek at Mr. Cobb's peeling, two-story clapboard home. Sheriff's cars, too, are making more rounds.
This is not how residents wanted Leith to get back on the map. Founded in 1909, the town bustled in the middle of the century, a regional center for festivals, movies and skating. The population began slipping after peaking at 174 in 1930, but the death knell was the closing of the railroad some 30 years ago. Though the 2010 census said the population is 16, Mr. Schock puts it at 24, and the Leith Bar is the only one of the five remaining buildings on Main Street still open. Most lots are empty and overgrown, laden with high-flying grasshoppers, in this town that sits in a bowl surrounded by wheat and sunflower fields.
Mr. Cobb happened upon the community, he said, through an ad for the home he eventually bought on Craigslist. He paid a total of about $8,600 for the house and 12 plots, he said, making his first purchases in 2011. He moved here in May 2012, he said, after fleeing Canada in 2010 to avoid the criminal charges. He spent some time in Montana, before coming to North Dakota to find work in the oil patch. He said he lost his construction job last week after the story broke.
People have knocked on Mr. Cobb's red door to offer to buy back his land and to preach the Gospel. The City Council is looking into potential ordinance or health code violations (his home has no septic tank or running water). There is a doomsday plan in place, Mr. Schock explained: If enough of Mr. Cobb's friends move in to gain a majority that could vote out the current government, the Council would immediately dissolve the town.
Mr. Harper, Leith's only black resident, said a lot of people approached him at his mother-in-law's funeral on Monday to tell him they had his back.
''People told me to leave town for the weekend and they'd take care of everything,'' he said.
But he and his wife, Sherrill -- who found herself referred to as a ''filthy race-mixing white woman'' in one of Mr. Cobb's online posts -- said they were not going anywhere.
Mr. Cobb, meanwhile, seems to be soaking in the publicity and mocking it.
''Just want to let you know I'm not going to cause any trouble,'' he said to Don Hauge, 61, who rolled up in a red Chevy pickup truck to where Mr. Cobb was sitting on a bench, peering through smudged rectangular glasses that slid down the bridge of his nose. Mr. Cobb is a lanky figure, dressed neatly in a button-down shirt tucked into slender black slacks he says he bought from someone who had stolen them, and rubber sandals.
In rapid-fire speech, Mr. Cobb cuts through a vast trove of facts and thoughts in his head, inevitably veering toward racial slurs. But he maintained a soft, calm tone, and was friendly when chatting with a black reporter who knocked on his door this week. He said he admired Louis Farrakhan because ''he organizes people and they're for themselves.''
But in that interview he also said that he hoped his plans in Leith would ''excite'' white people and ''give them confidence because we're being deracinated in our own country. We've been very, very tolerant about these major sociological changes.''
His beliefs began developing at an early age, he said -- he read Hitler's ''Mein Kampf'' when he was 11. To hear him tell it, he has had a colorful, nomadic life that has brought him face to face with James (Whitey) Bulger (the mob boss piloted the tugboat he rode to boarding school in Boston) and Barack Obama (he claims to have driven the future president in his taxi in Hawaii in the early 1980s).
It is difficult to tell whether Mr. Cobb wants or expects his vision for Leith to succeed.
Although he said that four fellow white nationalists have bought or acquired some of his plots, he said he did not know if or when they would be moving to the town, nor would he push the issue on them.
He gave the community's run-down former meat locker and creamery to the National Socialist Movement. Jeff Schoep, the movement's leader, said he was unsure how easy it would be for people, in a tough economy, to pack up and head to Leith. But he said he thought it was a fantastic idea to establish a community for white nationalists so they could have a safe place to land in a crisis -- say, a civil war.
''I would like to see it prosper and move forward,'' Mr. Schoep said. ''People should move there and get the process going. It gives us a base of support for elections and things like that.''
But as Ms. Ketterling has been hearing from her bar patrons all week, residents would rather see the venture fail.
''They're not happy,'' she said. ''We don't like that kind of stuff.''

HEADLINE: United States' 2nd-Quarter Growth Is Revised Up to 2.5%, From 1.7%

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The nation's economic output grew at a much faster rate in the second quarter than originally estimated, buoyed by an increase in exports.
Gross domestic product, a broad measure of goods and services produced across the economy, grew in the second quarter at an annualized rate of 2.5 percent in April through June of this year, the Commerce Department reported on Thursday. The government initially estimated G.D.P. at 1.7 percent.
The growth rate is still far lower than what the country needs to recover the ground lost during the recent recession anytime soon. The long-term average growth rate for the economy is more than 3 percent, and the economy needs above-trend growth to make up for sharp losses from the downturn. 
Even so, the upward revision was welcome news, particularly alongside another report on Thursday showing that jobless claims were falling. The improving economy is also likely to factor into the Federal Reserve's decision to pull back from its stimulus efforts, which some analysts expect as soon as September.
Expansion in the second quarter -- faster than the annualized growth rate in the first quarter of 1.1 percent -- was driven by gains in consumer spending, exports, private inventory investment, nonresidential fixed investment and residential fixed investment. Residential fixed investment, which reflects the sharp rebound in housing construction, has been one of the brightest spots in the economy so far this year, growing at an annualized rate of 12.9 percent in the second quarter and 12.5 percent in the first.
The shrinking government continues to drag on the economy. State and local government spending has declined almost every quarter for the last four years, and federal government spending fell during about half of those quarters. The upward revision to gross domestic product last quarter primarily reflected the fact that exports turned out to be higher than initially estimated and imports were actually slightly lower.
''The good news is that the economy accelerated in the second quarter to a degree that was even better than expected,'' said James M. Baird, chief investment officer for Plante Moran Financial Advisors. ''However, it's also clear that wary consumers and businesses haven't fully bought in to an imminent return to more robust growth and will not go 'all in' on spending and investment.''
The revisions seemed to further convince economists that the Federal Reserve will begin tapering its large-scale asset purchases at its September meeting. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has said that the central bank would slow these stimulus measures later this year, but did not specify when.
The output revisions ''should give Fed officials more confidence that the recovery is gathering steam,'' Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist for Capital Economics, wrote in a client note. Still, he said, ''it's no certainty, and August's nonfarm payroll figures will be watched closely,'' referring to the next jobs snapshot, due out on Sept. 6.
Economists noted that the upward revision for second-quarter G.D.P. addressed one of the puzzles in the data this year, about why hiring seemed to be picking up when output growth remained extraordinarily slow. The divergence between the two indicators did not seem sustainable, and some worried that a major slowdown in employment growth might be on the horizon.
Thursday's report ''adds to the likelihood that the apparent disconnect between employment and G.D.P. will be closed with G.D.P. moving up rather than employment down,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics. ''Some, but not all, of the disconnect was revised away today.''
Private forecasters seem to be expecting third-quarter growth in the 2 percent range, and did not seem to think that the upwardly revised second quarter brightened the growth picture.
''We continue to judge that a significant ramp up in growth is unlikely, particularly given the ongoing effects of fiscal tightening,'' said Peter Newland, an economist at Barclays. Congress's across-the-board automatic spending cuts have been weighing on the economy, and further cuts may come when the Senate and House convene in September. A fight over the debt ceiling also looms.

HEADLINE: Fed Broke Own Secrecy Rules

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's inspector general said the Fed violated its own rules for handling confidential material when it inadvertently issued the minutes of a policy meeting a day before the scheduled release in April. 
The inspector's report on Thursday recommended procedural changes after the Fed's minutes from March were sent a day early to more than 100 staff members in Congress, lobbyists for the financial industry, and employees of JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo.
The minutes had been scheduled for release at 2 p.m. April 10. The Fed discovered that they had been inadvertently e-mailed a day early by a staff member in the office that acts as the Fed's liaison with Congress. The Fed then released the minutes to the public and the news media five hours earlier than scheduled.
The inspector's report said the Fed had failed to provide sufficient training to employees in handling confidential information. It also said the Fed failed to properly limit access to employees who need to know the information before the public.
In response to the report, Fed officials said they had changed how they handle secret material like the minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee, the committee that sets interest-rate policies.
Two officials at the Fed, Michelle Smith and William English, said in a statement that they thought the steps the Fed had taken, with other changes being developed, would ''strengthen the board's information security.''

HEADLINE: Talks to Avert a Fiscal Crisis in the Fall End With No Result

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A White House meeting with Senate Republicans to try to find a path forward on deficit reduction and avert a fiscal crisis in the fall ended Thursday with both sides saying the talks have proven fruitless and might not continue. 
The meeting between senior White House aides, including Denis McDonough, the chief of staff, and eight senators ended with no date set for the next meeting and blunt talk of failure. Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, expressed concern that carrying on the dialogue would give a false impression of progress.
''This is just not going to happen at this time,'' he said. ''There's no point in continuing to act as if these discussions are leading some place.''
Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said: ''In America, you have to believe there's a pathway forward, but right now, I don't see it.''
With the next fiscal showdown in Washington just weeks away, the failure of the Senate-White House talks will shift attention toward Congressional leaders who have yet to engage in detailed talks to avert a political and possibly an economic disaster.
On Oct. 1, much of the government will run out of authority to spend money unless Congress acts to approve at least a stopgap spending measure. Then by mid-October, the Treasury will no longer be able to borrow money to finance the government unless lawmakers approve an increase in the statutory debt ceiling.
White House officials said Thursday that they never expected the Senate talks to defuse those twin crises. But the talks did grow out of a high-profile ''charm offensive'' by President Obama earlier this year aimed at wooing Senate Republicans to a deficit deal and isolating more intransigent House Republicans.
''We appreciated the meeting, which continued the series of candid -- and helpful -- exchanges,'' a White House official said.
Over the past weeks, the Senate group -- which called itself the ''sounding board'' -- had moved away from the kind of ''grand bargain'' Mr. Obama had sought, which would combine higher tax revenues and changes to social programs like Medicare to produce trillions of dollars in deficit reduction.
Instead, they aimed simply to replace the automatic across-the-board cuts known as the sequester over the next eight years with other budget changes.
Mr. Obama, in his most recent budget plan, had accepted $200 billion in sequester savings over eight years, and both sides appeared ready to leave in place small cuts to entitlement programs in the sequester legislation.
That left $518 billion in savings to find over eight years, but the White House's insistence that tax revenues be included and Republicans' refusal left the talks at an impasse.

HEADLINE: Cracking Down on Predatory Payday Lenders

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
The predatory industry known as payday lending is finally feeling the bite of state authorities alarmed that low-income borrowers are being gouged into long-term debt running at impossible interest rates of 500 percent and more. 
A prominent online lender that has increasingly run into state challenges -- Western Sky Financial, owned by a tribal member of the Cheyenne River Sioux -- has just announced that it will stop financing loans next month. Fifteen states have banned usurious payday lending to protect workers from the servitude of compound interest fees worthy of loan sharks. In reaction, lenders are now looking for other ways to ply their abusive trade -- by conducting business offshore via the Internet or through ties with American Indian groups invoking their sovereign nation status.
Western Sky Financial's retreat is a significant step forward in the government crackdown on payday lending. The company faces usury law challenges in five states, most recently in New York where Attorney General Eric Schneiderman filed suit this month charging the company with levying interest rates of more than 300 percent in violation of state law that caps interest at 25 percent. New York authorities have ordered 34 other online and American Indian lenders to stop providing online payday loans in the state, prompting American Indian groups to begin lawsuits in the name of their sovereignty.
Complaints of abuses by Western Sky Financial are being pressed by authorities in Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota and Oregon as officials focus on lenders' increasing resort to the Internet. ''The driver is technology,'' Mark Kaufman, Maryland's commissioner of financial regulation, told The Washington Post, citing the lenders' speed and furtiveness in online lending.
Payday lenders gull people into supposedly short-term borrowing until their next payday under terms that turn out to balloon the obligation into unsustainable long-term debt under a crescendo of interest costs. Millions of borrowers have become entrapped in situations where a supposed two-week loan rolls forward for an average of five months, according to research.
Tighter regulation by more states is obviously needed along with new federal protections to stop lenders from raiding borrowers' bank accounts. One encouraging sign from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was a report on payday lending this year that expressed concern that borrowers averaged 10 payday loans a year and paid $458 in fees. Firm standards and controls can rein in the abuses of payday lending.

HEADLINE: Oslo, 20 Years Later

BYLINE: By URI SAVIR

 BODY:
TEL AVIV -- In May 1993, I was the first Israeli to begin formal negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization, which resulted in the Oslo peace accords signed later in 1993 and Oslo II in 1995.
With a perspective of 20 years, the critical achievement of the process was to put an end to the maximalist scenarios of a greater Israel or a greater Palestine, ''from the sea to the Jordan.'' From Oslo on, it became clear that the land would ultimately have to be shared by two states.
On the other hand, Oslo failed to meet the Israeli and Palestinian expectation of resolving their bitter conflict, primarily due to the election in 1996 of an anti-Oslo government in Israel led by Benjamin Netanyahu, and also Yasser Arafat's failure to combat Palestinian terror and extremism. Nevertheless, after 20 years we can and should assess the lessons of the Oslo experience for the current peace process. 
The Oslo accords were the most that the leaders of Israel and the Palestinians were capable of achieving without outside assistance and intervention. To this day, leaders of the two nations are unable to put forth the difficult compromises that are necessary to resolve all the permanent-status issues, because if they did, they would not survive politically.
So one conclusion is that without active U.S. diplomacy -- mediation, not facilitation -- no agreement can be reached.
Innovative, forceful U.S. diplomacy, led by Secretary of State John Kerry, has to open the negotiations by advancing bridging proposals -- initially on the issues of borders and settlements, and later on the identity-related issues of Jerusalem and refugees.
The border must be resolved on the basis of the 1967 lines, with mutually agreed and parallel land swaps, and with Jerusalem as a shared capital. Otherwise a two-state solution is not feasible. Kerry should not underestimate the creative abilities of both sides to waste time on futile discussions, and must engage them on the essential issues.
Oslo also proved that even with the overwhelming authority over security that Israel reserved for itself, it was still not able to prevent Palestinian violence and terrorism. So for peace talks to be successful, a comprehensive security plan should be put forth by American generals who take Israel's security interests very much to heart.
The proposal should include securing borders (including the Jordan valley), intelligence gathering, regional anti-terrorism and the deployment of international forces such as NATO. Such a plan should be negotiated not by politicians but by military leaders of Israel, Palestine, Jordan and the United States.
In parallel, given the diverse threats to Israel from a volatile Middle East, the United States and Israel should negotiate a defense pact guaranteeing Israel's qualitative military advantage and security.
The future Palestinian state cannot develop a modern, prosperous economy, with transparent and accountable state institutions, on its own.
In the Oslo process, an international donor-mechanism was established to assist the Palestinian public sector, but the Palestinian economy was severely burdened by restrictive Israeli security measures.
This issue must become a prime concern in today's peace process. Economic and business professionals should be involved. It is important for American and European businesses to invest in the Palestinian private sector, as well as to encourage development in the field of high technology, with a focus on Palestinian youth.
A critical element in future peacemaking must be the regional context -- an issue that did not receive sufficient attention in the past. The Palestinians must be encouraged and supported by the Arab League in the concessions they will have to make.
As for Israel, the resolution of the conflict with the Palestinians must mean a fundamentally new relationship with the Arab world. Israel and the United States must insist that in return for Israeli territorial concessions in a permanent-status agreement, all Arab countries will establish full diplomatic and normal relations with the Jewish state. The Saudi peace initiative is a good basis for this.
The main lesson to be learned from Oslo is that for the peace process to be successful, it must be inclusive, not elitist. It must be a peace by the people, for the people. Arab and Jewish societies need to interact and cooperate and seek reconciliation. People-to-people relations should be added as a sixth permanent-status core issue on the negotiation table.
The vast majority of Israelis and Palestinians are young; the young on social networks have become the political barometers of Arab and Israeli society, and therefore must be placed at the core of the peace-building process emanating from a formal agreement.
The one thing that Oslo and a future agreement will have in common is that they are the right moral choice, aiming at ending Israeli occupation and Arab rejection.
Uri Savir is director-general of the Peres Center for Peace, in Tel Aviv-Jaffa. From 1993 to 1996 he was Israel's chief negotiator of the Oslo Accords.

HEADLINE: Leader of Terrorist Group Is Arrested, India Says

BYLINE: By HARI KUMAR and ELLEN BARRY

 BODY:
NEW DELHI -- The Indian authorities have arrested a leader of a terrorist group suspected in a series of deadly bombings in major cities, a top official announced Thursday. 
The suspect, Yasin Bhatkal, is one of the founders of Indian Mujahedeen, a banned Islamic militant group that is believed to be responsible for explosions in New Delhi, Mumbai and other major cities. He was arrested near the border with Nepal.
The official, Home Minister Sushil Kumar Shinde, told reporters in the capital that Mr. Bhatkal was in police custody and undergoing interrogation in the state of Bihar.
Mr. Bhatkal and several of his relatives founded Indian Mujahedeen and operated it from Pakistan, India's former home secretary, R. K. Singh, told the news channel NDTV. He said Mr. Bhatkal was among the network's most central figures and described his arrest as the latest in a series of ''major successes'' for Indian intelligence. Mr. Bhatkal, who is believed to be in his 30s and traveled under a long list of pseudonyms, was detained years ago in Kolkata, but the police did not ascertain his true identity and he was released, Mr. Singh said.
Mr. Bhatkal was reportedly captured on surveillance video in 2011 dropping a bag in a German bakery in Pune, southeast of Mumbai, and then leaving. Shortly afterward, a bomb exploded, killing 17 people and injuring 60.
It was the second major terrorism arrest in the past two weeks. The New Delhi police recently announced the arrest of Abdul Karim Tunda, an explosives expert who had been operating from Pakistan and who was also detained along the border with Nepal.
Indian Mujahedeen drew the public's attention in 2008 when it claimed responsibility for setting bombs that tore through the pink-walled center of Jaipur, in northern India, killing 63 people and injuring more than 100. The explosives had been attached to bicycles. A video message published at the time said the group's intent was to deter tourism and distance the Indian government from the United States.
A few months later, a series of low-intensity bombs -- also attached to bicycles -- killed 56 people and injured more than 200 in the city of Ahmedabad; some journalists received an e-mail saying Indian Mujahedeen was responsible. The group is also suspected of setting off five bombs at crowded markets and thoroughfares around New Delhi in September of the same year, killing dozens and wounding many more.
The authorities suspect that the group was involved in an attack in 2011 that targeted rush-hour travelers in Mumbai, the economic capital, and killed at least 17 people. Indian Mujahedeen has also been linked to an attack in February in which two blasts went off at a crowded bus stand in Hyderabad, killing 16 and injuring more than 100.

HEADLINE: U.S. Won't Sue to Reverse States' Legalization of Marijuana

BYLINE: By ASHLEY SOUTHALL and JACK HEALY; Ashley Southall reported from Washington, and Jack Healy from Denver.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Justice Department on Thursday said it would not sue to block laws legalizing marijuana in 20 states and the District of Columbia, a move that proponents hailed as an important step toward ending the prohibition of the drug.
In a memo to federal prosecutors nationwide on Thursday, James M. Cole, the deputy attorney general, erased some uncertainty about how the government would respond to state laws making it legal to use marijuana for medical or recreational purposes. 
Citing ''limited prosecutorial resources,'' Mr. Cole explained the change in economic terms. But the memo also made clear that the Justice Department expects states to put in place regulations aimed at preventing marijuana sales to minors, illegal cartel and gang activity, interstate trafficking of marijuana, and violence and accidents involving the drug.
''A system adequate to that task must not only contain robust controls and procedures on paper; it must also be effective in practice,'' he wrote.
Voters in Washington and Colorado recently approved measures decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of recreational marijuana, while 18 other states and the District of Columbia permit the use of marijuana for medical purposes.
In a phone call on Thursday afternoon, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. explained the government's ''trust but verify'' approach to Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington and Gov. John W. Hickenlooper of Colorado, a Justice Department official said.
Marijuana advocates praised the decision as a potentially historic shift in the federal government's attitude toward a drug it once viewed as a menace to public health. By allowing states to legalize and regulate marijuana, advocates said, the federal government could reduce jail populations and legal backlogs, create thousands of jobs, and replenish state coffers with marijuana taxes.
''This is a historic day,'' said Ean Seeb, a co-owner of a marijuana dispensary called Denver Relief. ''This is the beginning of the end of marijuana prohibition.''
But the prospect that marijuana could be legalized after a ban of decades drew criticism from law enforcement and drug policy officials. They warned that the Justice Department's decision would have unintended consequences, like more impaired driving and more criminal marijuana operations.
''This sends the wrong message,'' said former Representative Patrick J. Kennedy, who is a recovering prescription drug addict and a founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a policy group. ''Are we going to send up the white flag altogether and surrender and say 'have at it'? Or are we going to try to reduce the availability and accessibility of drugs and alcohol? That should be our mission.''
Under the new guidance, a large scale and a for-profit status would no longer make dispensaries and cultivation centers a potential target for criminal prosecution.
However, prosecutors have broad discretion in determining, for instance, whether drug laws exacerbate ''adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use.''
If federal prosecutors believe that a state's controls are inadequate, ''the federal government may seek to challenge the regulatory structure itself in addition to continuing to bring individual enforcement actions, including criminal prosecutions,'' Mr. Cole wrote.
The Justice Department official said the guidance was mandatory and did not apply retroactively.
In Colorado and Washington, the passage of ballot measures left the states' drug laws in sharp opposition to federal drug policy, and raised questions about how federal law enforcement agents would respond to new retail marijuana stores. Some members of Congress sought to have the administration clarify whether state officials risked federal criminal prosecution while carrying out their duties under the state laws.
''It's a relief,'' said Representative Jared Polis, a Colorado Democrat. ''It'll get the criminal element out of the marijuana trade. It'll provide legitimate business opportunities for everything from farmers to processors to retail store owners.''
Mr. Cole is scheduled to testify on Sept. 10 at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing focused on clarifying the administration's stance.
The White House said last week that President Obama did not support changing federal laws regulating marijuana, which treat the drug as a dangerous substance with no medical purpose.
Josh Earnest, a White House spokesman, said the president believed it was best to focus on high-level offenders like kingpins and traffickers.
The decision on Thursday followed Mr. Holder's announcement this month that federal prosecutors would no longer seek federal mandatory minimum sentences for certain low-level nonviolent drug offenders.
The announcement did not address the financial hurdles facing marijuana dispensaries and growing operations, like their access to loans and other banking services. Many banks are reluctant to do business with marijuana growers and sellers, for fear of violating federal laws.

HEADLINE: Stronger G.D.P. Growth and Lower Job Claims Bolster Markets

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Positive news on the American economy on Thursday outweighed worries about Syria, sending the stock market higher.
The Dow Jones industrial average added 16.44 points, or 0.11 percent, to 14,840.95, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.21 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,638.17. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 26.95 points, or 0.75 percent, to 3,620.30.
The Dow has gained 64 points over the last two days, not nearly enough to make up for its 170-point loss on Tuesday as tensions over Syria rattled markets. 
Wayne F. Wilbanks, chief investment officer at the asset management firm Wilbanks, Smith & Thomas, said the market might have fallen too quickly.
He also cautioned that the gains from the last two days might not last. ''Be very careful,'' he said. ''You haven't missed out on much if you've sat on the sidelines since May. I'm not putting a lot of money to work here.''
Verizon Communications was the biggest gainer among the blue chips after Vodafone of Britain confirmed it was in talks with Verizon to sell its 45 percent stake in their joint venture, Verizon Wireless. Verizon rose $1.26, or 2.71 percent, to $47.82. The United States-listed shares of Vodafone rose $2.39, or 8.13 percent, to $31.80.
While many fund managers said they were not looking to jump back into the market just yet, some individual companies were looking attractive again.
''If you're a long-term investor, it's an opportunity,'' said Richard Sichel, chief investment officer at the Philadelphia Trust Company, which has $1.9 billion under management.
Traders had two good economic reports to parse on Thursday. The economy grew at a 2.5 percent annual rate from April through June, much faster than previously estimated, the government said.
Also, the Labor Department said the number of people who filed for unemployment benefits last week fell to 331,000, the fewest in five years.
While lower unemployment claims and an upward revision in the gross domestic product are both positive signs, most of Wall Street's attention is focused on next week, when the August jobs report will be released. The Federal Reserve is expected to decide the fate of its huge bond-buying program in mid-September, and the jobs survey will be the last bit of significant economic data the Fed will have to consider before making its decision.
Traders also continue to watch Syria, where a United States-led attack could happen, although such a strike seems less imminent than earlier in the week. Oil fell to below $109 a barrel Thursday.
''The general feeling is that Syrian tensions have eased a bit,'' said Alec Young, global equity strategist with S&P Capital IQ.
The price of crude oil fell $1.30, or 1.2 percent, to $108.80 a barrel. Oil had climbed as high as $112 earlier this week.
Energy-related stocks fell. Exxon Mobil slipped 1.77 percent, or $1.57, to $87.27, and Chevron fell 1.18 percent, or $1.44, to $120.37.
Investors worry that a limited strike could drag the United States and its allies into that nation's civil war, or worse, set off a regional conflict in an area where so much of the world's oil is.
Beyond the news about Syria, it has been a mostly quiet week for stocks. Traders are winding down during the last week of summer and heading out for the Labor Day holiday.
Mr. Wilbanks said he did not expect the market to move substantially higher, citing the mediocre second-quarter earnings that companies just finished reporting. ''We're going to need to see robust corporate profit growth to move the market higher,'' he said.
In other corporate news, the clothing store operator Guess jumped $3.51, or 12.85 percent, to $30.82, after the company reported second-quarter profit and revenue Wednesday that surpassed the expectations of analysts. The retailer also raised its profit forecast for the year.
Campbell Soup fell $1.38, or 3.09 percent, to $43.33, after posting a loss for its fiscal fourth quarter. The company's results were dragged down by a charge related to the potential sale of a European business. While the results topped Wall Street's estimates, revenue missed expectations.
Government bonds were little changed. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 1/32, to 97 24/32. The yield edged down to 2.76 percent from 2.77 percent late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Not Crying For Argentina But Fearful Of a Ruling

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
In the world of sovereign debt defaults, it is hard to imagine a less sympathetic debtor than Argentina. It has defaulted again and again for nearly two centuries, with few apologies. After the country's most recent default, in 2001, it refused to negotiate for four years and then offered creditors a deal worth about 30 cents on the dollar -- and vowed that those who refused would receive nothing.
After a second offer -- on the same terms -- in 2010, all but 7 percent of the bonds have been exchanged. But some of the remaining ones were owned by hedge funds that went to court. Last week they won a decision from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York that has caused considerable concern at institutions like the Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund.
The decision essentially says that Argentina cannot pay any creditors if it does not pay all of them, and says banks -- in the United States and perhaps around the world -- could face contempt charges if they allow Argentina to make payments to only those lenders it wishes to pay. 
''While we strongly disagree with Argentina's actions in the international financial arena,'' a senior Treasury official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said this week, ''we have serious concerns that the Second Circuit's decision will undermine the orderliness and predictability of sovereign debt restructuring and could roll back years of progress.''
The United States government, in a brief filed with the appeals court before it made its decision, urged that it not take the course it ultimately took, warning that the decision could damage the status of New York as a chief world financial center and cause ''a detrimental effect on the systemic role of the U.S. dollar'' by encouraging countries to denominate their debt in other currencies and put them outside the jurisdiction of United States courts.
The International Monetary Fund, in a paper issued earlier this year, warned that the decision could ''risk undermining the sovereign debt restructuring process.''
Such fears were brushed aside in the appeals court decision.
''We do not believe the outcome of this case threatens to steer bond issuers away from the New York marketplace,'' said the opinion, written by Judge Barrington D. Parker. ''On the contrary, our decision affirms a proposition essential to the integrity of the capital markets: borrowers and lenders may, under New York law, negotiate mutually agreeable terms for their transactions, but they will be held to those terms. We believe that the interest -- one widely shared in the financial community -- in maintaining New York's status as one of the foremost commercial centers is advanced by requiring debtors, including foreign debtors, to pay their debts.''
Most international bonds are issued under either New York law or English law. The I.M.F., in its paper, states that under English law bondholders have no rights to file suits. Only the bond's trustee can do that, and the trustee can be compelled to act only if a large number of bondholders demand it. It was concern that countries would flock to English law that led to the United States government warning that New York's status as a world financial center could be damaged.
In the past, as the I.M.F. paper noted, it has been easy to get an American court to render a judgment against a country that defaulted on its bonds, but ''it has been far more difficult to find assets that can be used to satisfy the judgment.''
That is because a federal law severely limits the assets that bondholders can seek to attach. Diplomatic missions are off limits, as are many other assets. And it is obvious that the courts of the nation that defaulted are not going to help the unfortunate creditors. So having the judgment has in the past proved to be worth very little.
But the appeals court has turned that around, at least in the case of Argentina. It concluded that Argentina is required by the ''pari passu'' clause that, in one form or another, is standard in bond contracts, to treat all its bondholders alike. So if it pays the interest payments owed on its restructured bonds, it must also pay the money owed on the bonds whose holders refused to restructure. And because those bonds are in default, that means the entire amount of principal and interest is owed and must be paid.
The United States brief says that interpretation of ''pari passu'' is simply wrong. ''The settled understanding of pari passu clauses is that selective repayment does not violate the clause, even if it is the result of sovereign policy,'' the brief stated. ''This view has been expressed not only by the United States, but by academics, governmental bodies, and market participants.'' It noted that similar clauses had not been impediments to debt restructurings in the 1980s and 1990s.
That, in and of itself, would have little effect. Argentina could simply ignore the ruling and continue to make payments on the restructured bonds while ignoring the other ones.
But the court also made it clear that it would view anyone who helped Argentina make such payments as ''assisting in a violation of the injunction.'' It directly ordered Bank of New York Mellon, the trustee for the restructured bonds, not to make the payments to bondholders if Argentina sends it the money. And it warned that others not named in the case might face legal problems if they helped Argentina.
The court brushed aside complaints that it lacked jurisdiction over foreign banks that might be involved, as well as complaints that banks not parties to the current case are bound by the ruling. ''Payment system participants have not been deprived of due process because, if and when they are summoned to answer for assisting in a violation of the district court's injunctions, they will be entitled to notice and the right to be heard,'' the court said. In other words, they can get their day in court only if they risk the possibility of being charged with contempt of court.
The appeals court stayed its ruling pending a possible appeal to the Supreme Court, so for the time being the banks can assist in paying the holders of restructured bonds.
If the Supreme Court believes this case could set a precedent that would transform the face of international debt restructurings, it might be more likely to agree to hear the appeal.
It is an idea that the appeals court sought to forestall, saying ''this case is an exceptional one with little apparent bearing on transactions that can be expected in the future,'' in part because ''Argentina has been a uniquely recalcitrant debtor.'' It noted that many bonds now being issued contained ''collective action clauses,'' which allow a restructuring to be forced on holdout bondholders if a supermajority of holders agree. If the supermajority did go along, there could be no holdouts to bring suit. There was no such supermajority clause in the Argentine bonds that were restructured.
One former I.M.F. senior staff member, Charles Blitzer, who is now a consultant who works on international debt restructurings, agreed with the court's assessment. ''The number of potential cases where this could apply is microscopic,'' he said in an interview.
But the I.M.F. paper said a decision like the one issued by the appeals court would ''give holdout creditors greater leverage'' and make it much harder to get supermajority approval. And it pointed out that even with collective action clauses, it can be possible to block a restructuring with a relatively small investment in a particular bond issue.
In an address to the nation this week, President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner defended Argentina's record. ''Instead of recalcitrant debtors, we are serial payers,'' she said, pointing to the payments the country has made on the restructured bonds. She said her government would offer to swap the restructured bonds for ones with identical terms under Argentine law and not that of New York.
If that swap succeeded, the new bonds could presumably be honored without violating the injunction. But it seems likely that Elliott Management, the hedge fund manager that is the primary plaintiff in the case, would ask the court to block such an exchange.
It is hard to find anyone involved in international debt restructurings who has a good word to say about Argentina, which has been formally censured by the I.M.F. for its actions. But to the I.M.F., as well as the Treasury Department, there needs to be a way to accomplish international restructurings that allows overly indebted countries to eventually recover, and this decision could obstruct that.

HEADLINE: De Blasio Leads in Mayoral Poll, Reshaping Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and DALIA SUSSMAN; Allison Kopicki, Marina Stefan and Megan Thee-Brenan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Frustration with New York City's unaffordability and its aggressive police tactics is elevating Bill de Blasio, once dismissed as a left-leaning long shot, into the lead of the Democratic mayoral primary field, according to a poll by The New York Times and Siena College.
Christine C. Quinn, the longtime front-runner in the nomination contest, is now lagging far behind Mr. de Blasio and struggling to connect with members of her own party: forty-five percent of likely Democratic voters view her unfavorably.
With 11 days remaining until the primary, the new survey shows a drastically reshaped race as a broad cross-section of voters embraces Mr. de Blasio's candidacy. It found that 32 percent of likely Democratic voters supported Mr. de Blasio, who is the city's elected public advocate, compared with 18 percent for William C. Thompson Jr., the former comptroller, and 17 percent for Ms. Quinn, the speaker of the City Council. 
Mr. de Blasio's campaign, fueled by a relentless focus on economic disparity and a searing critique of the Bloomberg administration, has transcended the city's traditional demographic divisions: he is drawing higher levels of support from men and women, older and younger, than any of his rivals. He has won the backing of those who think the city is headed in the right direction and those convinced it is on the wrong track.
With so little time left in the primary, Mr. de Blasio's commanding lead will quite likely force his Democratic rivals to recalibrate their strategies, intensify their attacks and seek to land decisive blows against him during the final televised debate next week.
The citywide Times/Siena College poll was conducted on landlines and cellphones from Aug. 19 to 28 with 505 likely Democratic primary voters. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points.
As voters prepare for a change in City Hall, the poll shows that Democrats remain deeply conflicted over the state of the city: they are evenly split over whether they approve or disapprove of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's job performance, and over whether the city is headed in the right or wrong direction.
Mr. de Blasio's campaign has sought to capitalize on that unease, especially among the city's liberal voters. But the survey suggests that his appeal has reached beyond the left-leaning constituencies he cultivated first as a councilman, then as public advocate.
Mr. Thompson and Ms. Quinn have attempted to portray themselves as somewhat moderate Democrats prepared to inherit a city government run over the past two decades by a Republican and then a Republican-turned-independent. But more Democrats say they think that Mr. de Blasio would do the best job of keeping the city safe and creating jobs.
However, it is his liberal views on the high cost of living in the city -- captured by his slogan of ''a tale of two cities'' -- that have resonated deeply: 29 percent say Mr. de Blasio would do the best job of making the city affordable, compared with 19 percent for Mr. Thompson and 15 percent for Ms. Quinn.
In a stinging development for Ms. Quinn, a former housing activist who has made the construction of low-income housing a cornerstone of her campaign, 30 percent of likely Democratic voters think Mr. de Blasio would do the best job of fixing the city's housing needs. Eighteen percent said Mr. Thompson would, and 16 percent said Ms. Quinn would. Mr. de Blasio has a nine-point lead among women, a group Ms. Quinn expected to win.
Mr. de Blasio, who has brought his African-American wife to campaign stops and featured their biracial son in his television commercials, has managed to pull off an unusual feat: winning slightly more support from black voters than the sole black candidate in the race, Mr. Thompson, although the gap is within the poll's margin of sampling error.
In a follow-up interview, Ronald Katz, a 54-year-old de Blasio supporter who lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, said he was drawn to the candidate's diverse family.
''That's home for me, I have one as well,'' he said. ''I guess that my decision is less political than it is personal.''
In a campaign dominated by an emotional debate over stop-and-frisk police tactics, Mr. de Blasio's heated denunciations have attracted voters who object to it. Of those who think that the use of the tactic is excessive, 39 percent support Mr. de Blasio, 20 percent are for Mr. Thompson and 13 percent are for Ms. Quinn.
The poll demonstrates the political challenges facing Ms. Quinn, a longtime ally of Mr. Bloomberg and the subject of intense attacks from her rivals and well-financed detractors, since the start of the mayor's race.
The barrage, it seems, has taken a toll: 45 percent of likely Democratic voters have an unfavorable opinion of her, compared with 17 percent who have an unfavorable opinion of Mr. de Blasio and 16 percent of Mr. Thompson.
Mr. de Blasio emerges as personally popular, with 57 percent expressing a favorable opinion of him, as does Mr. Thompson with 53 percent. Ms. Quinn is viewed favorably by 39 percent.
Steven McCain, 61, of the Bronx, said he had been leaning toward Ms. Quinn, but grew wary of what he saw as her emphasis on Manhattan and her failure to ''make a strong stand'' on police stops. Above all, he said, he dislikes her ties to the mayor.
''Most people are tired of Bloomberg -- sick and tired of him,'' Mr. McCain said. ''And the more I saw of her, I saw more of the same Bloomberg.''
The poll highlights lingering grievances against Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn. Five years after the pair rewrote the city's term limits law so that they -- and fellow city officials -- could seek third terms, 68 percent of likely Democratic voters now call the move a bad idea. Among those critics, 36 percent are backing Mr. de Blasio, compared with 14 percent for Ms. Quinn and 21 percent for Mr. Thompson.
In the race for New York City comptroller the poll found that 50 percent of likely Democratic voters supported former Gov. Eliot Spitzer, compared with 35 percent for Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president.
Even at this late date, the poll revealed the race for mayor might still change. Sixteen percent of likely Democratic voters remain undecided, and of those who have chosen a candidate, only 37 percent are absolutely certain about their choice.
The results will hinge on a small fraction of the city's population -- fewer than 800,000 Democrats are expected to participate in the Sept. 10 primary. There will be an automatic runoff on Oct. 1 if no candidate receives 40 percent of the vote.
''Turnout for this primary election,'' said Donald P. Levy, director of the Siena Research Institute, ''is anyone's guess.''

&#x2605; AlunaGeorge (Thursday and next Friday) This young electro-R&B pair from London have a hypnotizing way with their heartbreak: the producer George Reid shatters and reassembles driving glitch beats under the singer Aluna Francis' cool, sky-high falsetto. Their debut, ''Body Music'' (Vagrant/Island), is one of the year's best; ''White Noise,'' their recent collaboration with the equally suave dance duo Disclosure, pushed their summer over the top.

Marc Anthony (Sunday) Tabloids in the United States unfailingly relegate the musical accomplishments of Mr. Anthony, one of the best-selling salsa artists of all time, as a footnote to his divorce from the actress and pop star Jennifer Lopez.

Fool's Gold Day Off with Duck Sauce and Danny Brown (Monday) Fool's Gold Records, a bustling dance and hip-hop imprint, upgrades its free annual Labor Day party significantly with a move to the Williamsburg Park stage from City Winery's backyard. This year's lineup includes Duck Sauce, the dance duo comprising the D.J.'s Armand Van Helden and A-Trak, which still holds an insistent grasp on New York club floors with the winningly nonsensical hit ''Barbra Streisand.'' The eccentric Detroit rapper Danny Brown will also be there; his new album, ''Old,'' the followup to 2011's ''XXX,'' is scheduled to be released on Sept. 30.

Last fall they celebrated the 15th anniversary of their debut album, ''Too Far to Care'' (Elektra), by performing it in full on tour. The band's spirited lead singer, Rhett Miller, will be hard-pressed not to offer a track or two from it during this solo set.

With Diarrhea Planet. At 10:30 p.m., Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700, mercuryloungenyc.com; $12. (Anderson)
Suuns (Wednesday) These prog-rockers from Montreal take Hemingway-like economy with their tunes, stacking small fragments of dissonant melody into dense, enormous waves. Their 2010 debut album, ''Zeroes QC,'' merely suggested the sensational power of their live jams; the follow-up, ''Images Du Futur'' (both Secretly Canadian), carried a sinister pace and came closer to their thundering stage experience. With Rose Windows and Dinowalrus. At 8 p.m., Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 505-3474, lepoissonrouge.com; $12 in advance; $15 at the door. (Anderson)
Taj Mahal Trio (Friday) More than 40 years into his storied career, this bluesman brings his Grammy-winning alchemy of gruff wails, searching harmonica and nontraditional tropicalia beats to this serene vintner's hall. And one hopes the audience's response will match the intense reception heard on his superb live disc from 2000, ''Shoutin' in Key'' (Hannibal). At 8 p.m., City Winery, 155 Varick Street, near Spring Street, South Village, (212) 608-0555, citywinery.com; $55 to $75. (Anderson)
Ten Years Alive on the Infinite Plain with Omar Souleyman (Saturday) Dabke, a traditional strain of Middle Eastern folk-pop, meets its contemporary match in this pop-minded, hyperactive musician from Syria. Now a staple of Western rock festivals, he collaborated with Björk on her ''Biophilia'' (Nonesuch) in 2011 and his forthcoming release, ''Wenu Wenu'' (Ribbon Music), produced by Four Tet, is due out in October. Bobb Trimble's Flying Spiders, 75 Dollar Bill and others will join Mr. Souleyman at this event, which kicks off a two-month festival celebrating the art hub Issue Project Room's 10th anniversary. At 4 p.m., Pioneer Works, 159 Pioneer Street, Red Hook, Brooklyn, issueprojectroom.org; $15, $12 for members and students. (Anderson)
&#x2605; Yacht (Friday) The world is a barren, malignant and highly danceable place in ''Shangri-La'' (DFA), the fifth album from this disco-punk duo from Portland. Their long-form conceptual exploration of a postapocalyptic wasteland is stacked with hyperactive screams, galvanizing synth beats and graphic narratives that would make Cormac McCarthy flinch. With Ludwig Persik and Ryan Power. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $16 in advance, $18 at the door. (Anderson)

HEADLINE: Indonesia Increases Benchmark Interest Rate

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
The Indonesian central bank raised its interest rates on Thursday, in a desperate effort to shore up a currency that has been badly hit by the recent sell-off in emerging markets worldwide. 
The Indonesian central bank's decision, announced at a hastily called board meeting, raised the benchmark rate by half a percentage point, to 7 percent, and highlighted the increasing pressure that many of the world's largest developing economies have faced while market sentiment has withered.
Investors have poured billions of dollars into emerging economies in recent years, as buoyant growth rates and relatively high interest rates made them attractive investments compared with the United States and Europe. Since May, however, a gradual recovery in the West and signs that the Federal Reserve would soon scale back its support of the American economy have prompted a stark shift away from emerging markets back to assets like United States Treasury securities.
That shift has dragged down stocks and currencies in emerging markets, depriving them of the cash that fueled their previous growth spurts and raising the cost of crucial imports like oil.
Hit hardest have been those countries that, like Indonesia, have trade deficits and are more risky in the eyes of investors.
The benchmark Indonesian stock index has plunged more than 20 percent in the last three months, making it one of the world's worst performers over that period. Similarly, the rupiah has slumped to its lowest level since April 2009. On Thursday, it was trading at 10,935 per dollar -- down from about 9,720 in May.
Less than a week ago, the government announced a package of policy measures aimed at reducing imports and bolstering investment in labor-intensive industries.
In Brazil, which also runs a current account deficit and has had its currency plunge, the central bank announced a similar rate increase on Wednesday. That move took the benchmark Selic rate to 9 percent, from 8.5 percent.
And in India, which faces the added problem of policy gridlock before elections next year, policy makers have over the last few weeks announced a series of administrative measures aimed at narrowing the current account deficit and limiting cash outflows.
For the time being, however, such measures appear to be having limited effect, and more measures are likely to follow.
''We believe further rate hikes are needed to restore market confidence amid Indonesia's deteriorating economic fundamentals,'' analysts at the British bank Standard Chartered wrote in a note about the country's rate decision on Thursday.
Although rate increases could hurt economic activity, they will help to contain inflation and preserve growth momentum in household consumption and investment, they wrote.
The situation is tougher in India, where the central bank has less room to maneuver, and where a looming election next year has hampered policy making. The rupee has slumped to record lows against the United States dollar, raising concerns of a broader crisis of confidence in the country, although on Thursday the rupee gained 3.4 percent, its largest one-day gain since 1986.

Great North River Tugboat Race and Competition (Sunday) Tugboats and their operators will be duking it out -- in a nautical sense -- at this annual event in and along the Hudson River, from 44th Street to just south of the 79th Street Boat Basin. A main objective of the day is to educate the public about the ecological importance of the harbor as the ''greenest way to ship things,'' said Capt. John Doswell, executive director of the Working Harbor Committee, one of the event sponsors.
A parade of boats -- up the Hudson from Pier 84, at 44th Street, to just shy of the Boat Basin -- will start the day off at 10 a.m. Once there, the tugboats will turn around and race back to Pier 84, where there will be bow-to-bow pushing contests and other challenges. (Above, boats in a previous race, and, below, a deckhand throwing a dock line.) 
For those who want to be a part of the parade and race, a cruise operated by Circle Line Sightseeing will depart at 9:30 a.m. from Pier 83 at West 43rd Street.

HEADLINE: In New Wave of Walkouts, Fast-Food Strikers Gain Momentum

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
As a wave of one-day walkouts by fast-food workers gains momentum in a push for a $15 hourly wage, the movement has been notable both for the prominence of young faces and for the audacity of their demand.
On Thursday, the protests involved workers at nearly 1,000 restaurants in more than 50 cities, organizers said, spreading to areas of the South and West including Atlanta, Los Angeles, Memphis, and Raleigh, N.C. 
The Service Employees International Union has provided financial support to the one-day walkouts since they began a month ago at restaurants of McDonald's, Burger King and other chains in seven cities. Many and perhaps most of the workers have been in their 20s.
Jake Rosenfeld, a sociology professor and labor expert at the University of Washington, said the strikes could elevate the union movement's standing among younger workers who have grown up in an era when unions have steadily lost membership and power.
''It should reinforce the labor movement as something new and relevant to the young workers of today,'' Professor Rosenfeld said. And pointing to the use of the Internet to spread the strike call, he added, ''The combination of old and new organizing strategies really seems to have paid off here.''
But even with the attention the strikes have drawn, the big question remains whether the walkouts can achieve any traction on the main demand -- the wage increase to $15 an hour in an industry in which many of the 2.3 million fast food workers earn the federal minimum of $7.25 an hour.
Arne Kalleberg, a sociology professor at the University of North Carolina and author of the book ''Good Jobs, Bad Jobs,'' said: ''The strikes are an indication of a great frustration that's been building up over a long time. It reflects the fact that people are really concerned with increasing inequality.''
One such frustrated worker was Roberto Tejada, who earns $8 an hour at a Taco Bell in Los Angeles. ''People can't survive on the minimum wage,'' he said. ''Nobody who works full time should live in poverty.''
Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez has pointed to the strikes as evidence that the federal minimum wage should be increased. President Obama has proposed a $9 minimum wage, but many Republicans have denounced the idea, saying it would eliminate jobs.
Steve Caldeira, president of the International Franchise Association, warned that a raise to $15 an hour would hurt franchisees -- and would result in less hiring. ''Mandating increased wages would lead to higher prices for consumers, lower foot traffic'' and lost jobs, he said.
And a corporate-backed group, the Employment Policies Institute, ran a full-page advertisement in The Wall Street Journal, saying that a $15 wage would mean ''fewer entry-level jobs and more automated alternatives -- even in the kitchen.''
The strike's organizers have had feverish discussions -- including a meeting with academics in Las Vegas -- to figure out how to attain their goal. One idea is to persuade city councils to pass a $15-an-hour minimum wage for fast-food workers. Another is not to hit up hard-pressed franchisees for the raises, but instead to get the chains to channel some of the fees they obtain from franchises into higher wages.
Mary Kay Henry, president of the Service Employees International Union, said the expansion of the strikes was helping to persuade government officials and community groups that the demand was not unrealistic.
''It's moving people to understand that $15 is increasingly reasonable,'' she said. ''It's becoming crystal clear to a lot of people that if these workers who earn $9,000 a year could earn $18,000, that could make a big change in their neighborhoods.''
But Professor Kalleberg acknowledged that the chains would not be so easily persuaded.
''You'll have to put consumer pressure on the companies,'' he said. ''The consumer is the lever here. I don't know how about $15. Obama is having a problem getting to $9. I think something in between may be realistic.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Previews and Openings
'All the Faces of the Moon' (previews begin on Thursday; opens on Sept. 11) If you've got 29 nights free, in a row, and the right 29 nights, you can see all of what promises to be one of the more unusual theatrical offerings of this season or any other: this new piece by the monologuist Mike Daisey (''The Agony and the Ecstasy of Steve Jobs''). Each night of the coming lunar cycle he's performing new material, each night onstage with a different oil painting commissioned just for the show. Of course, you can try anywhere between 1 and 29 of the parts of this play, which Mr. Daisey says will delve into the secret history of New York. First up: ''Playing the Hand You're Dealt.'' Joe's Pub, at the Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, joespub.com. (David DeWitt) 
'Big Fish' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Oct. 6) Among the season's more intriguing titles, this musicalization of the 2003 Tim Burton film -- about a young man trying to sift through his father's extremely unreliable stories -- garnered rave reviews during its Chicago engagement this spring. Norbert Leo Butz, Kate Baldwin and Bobby Steggert lead the cast; Andrew Lippa (''The Addams Family'') wrote the music and lyrics; and Susan Stroman (who gave Mr. Butz his big break in ''Thou Shalt Not'') is the director and choreographer. Neil Simon Theater, 250 West 52nd Street, Manhattan, (866) 870-2717, bigfishthemusical.com. (Eric Grode)
'Fetch Clay, Make Man' (in previews; opens on Sept. 12) Pairing one of black America's most beloved heroes (Cassius Clay, soon to be known as Muhammad Ali) with one of its most reviled performers (Lincoln Perry's screen character Stepin Fetchit) may sound like the makings of a cheeky improv skit, but the two men actually became friends in the 1960s. Will Power (''The Seven'') builds his drama around this unlikely relationship; Des McAnuff (''Jersey Boys'') directs. New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 460-5475, nytw.org. (Grode)
'The Glass Menagerie' (previews begin on Thursday; opens on Sept. 26) This classic Tennessee Williams drama from 1945, lavishly honored and about as canonical an American work as they come, returns for its seventh Broadway run. This time the members of the Wingfield family are played by Cherry Jones, Celia Keenan-Bolger and Zachary Quinto, with Brian J. Smith as the Gentleman Caller. Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (800) 432-7250, telecharge.com. (DeWitt)
'The Hill Town Plays' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Several spaces in the West Village will be part of this ambitious cycle of five related plays by Lucy Thurber (''Scarcity,'' ''Ashville,'' ''Where We're Born,'' ''Killers and Other Family,'' and ''Stay''). In addition to Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, Ms. Thurber's most reliable base of operations in New York (three of these plays have previously been staged there), Axis Theater and the New Ohio Theater and both Cherry Lane Theater spaces will present important stages in one fictional woman's life. Various locations, (866) 811-4111, theatervillage.com. (Grode)
'The Machine' (previews begin on Wednesday; opens next Friday) Chess is not the activity you might expect to command attention in the spacious Park Avenue Armory, but this play, by Matt Charman and staged by Josie Rourke of the Donmar Warehouse in London, challenges that thought. It tells of Garry Kasparov's famed 1997 match in New York against Deep Blue, the IBM supercomputer. Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 616-3930, armoryonpark.org. (DeWitt)
'Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play' (in previews; opens on Sept. 15) The end of civilization has been on artists' minds lately, and now the adventurous Civilians have joined the post-apocalyptic parade. In this new play by Anne Washburn, one random episode of ''The Simpsons'' is the last remnant of Western culture. If the all-star downtown cast (which includes Quincy Tyler Bernstine, Matthew Maher and Jennifer R. Morris) and subject matter aren't enough of a draw, there's also a new score by Michael Friedman (''Love's Labour's Lost''). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'The Old Friends' (in previews; opens on Sept. 12) The Signature Theater's devotion to Horton Foote continues with the premiere of this drama by Foote, who died in 2009 and whose late-career success was fueled in no small part by the Signature's season-long retrospective in 1994. Michael Wilson (''The Trip to Bountiful'') directs two fellow Foote veterans, Lois Smith and Horton's daughter Hallie Foote, as well as Betty Buckley in this play about an uneasy meeting between two Texas farming families. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)
'Philip Goes Forth' (in previews; opens on Sept. 16) George Kelly wrote several timeless comedies in the 1920s, including ''The Show-Off'' and ''The Torch Bearers,'' but the mixed reviews he received for this 1931 work put him off playwriting for five years. If anyone is equipped to make the case for this gently satirical play, about an aspiring young playwright with more ambition than talent, it is the Mint Theater, which is giving ''Philip Goes Forth'' its first New York City revival. Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Grode)
'The Recommendation' (in previews; opens on Sept. 6) An old friendship gets a jolt when the popular, plugged-in Aaron Feldman is pulled over for a broken taillight and his friend, the unconnected Iskinder Iudoku, has the advantage. This is the most prominent staging to date for Jonathan Caren, who won a playwriting award for the piece when it had its premiere last year at the Old Globe in San Diego. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, theflea.org. (Grode)
'Romeo and Juliet' (in previews; opens on Sept. 19) Despite being maybe the best-known romance in the history of Western theater, ''Romeo and Juliet'' has not been performed on Broadway in more than 35 years. Stepping in to fill the breach are Condola Rashad, fresh off ''The Trip to Bountiful,'' and the relative stage neophyte Orlando Bloom. (Sadly, this production is set in modern times, so the sword skills Mr. Bloom honed for the ''Lord of the Rings'' and ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' films will most likely go unused here.) David Leveaux has surrounded his young stars with seasoned stage veterans like Brent Carver, Chuck Cooper and Jayne Houdyshell. Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Grode)
'stop. reset.' (in previews; opens on Sept. 8) The future of the written word is very much on the minds of the employees of a Chicago publishing house in this new play written and directed by Regina Taylor (''Crowns''). In the course of trying to find an answer, the company's owner meets what the press materials describe as ''a mysterious youth plugged into the future,'' which seems like a pretty good description of young people in general these days. Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Grode)
'Women or Nothing' (in previews; opens on Sept. 16) The Atlantic Theater has had several hits with batches of one-act plays by Ethan Coen (who, with Joel, is part of the Academy Award-winning Coen brothers tandem), and now Mr. Coen has written his first full-length work for the company. It's about two women who are eager to have a baby -- so eager that they might even be willing to sleep with a man to get one. David Cromer directs Susan Pourfar, one of his stars from ''Tribes,'' as one half of the couple, along with Halley Feiffer. Linda Gross Theater, 336 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (866) 811-4111, atlantictheater.org. (Grode)
'You Never Can Tell' (previews begin on Tuesday; opens on Sept. 15) George Bernard Shaw wrote this play after ''Mrs. Warren's Profession,'' so he'd already been known for giving his women articulate wit and their own spark of divine fire. Here such women include Mrs. Clandon, a feminist author who's returned her family to England, and her two grown daughters. Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (DeWitt)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Anthony Warlow and Faith Prince as Miss Hannigan (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'First Date' The winning Zachary Levi and Krysta Rodriguez star in this cliché-ridden romantic comedy, with a book by Austin Winsberg and a score by Alan Zachary and Michael Weiner. Mr. Levi is the nice Jewish boy who's had his heart kicked around, Ms. Rodriguez a boho chick with lots of experience. They're all wrong for each other, right? Sorry, but no prizes will be given for guessing how this familiar story ends (1:30). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Kinky Boots' Cyndi Lauper has created a love-and-heat-seeking score that performs like a pop star on Ecstasy. This Harvey Fierstein-scripted tale of lost souls in shoe business, in which a young factory owner (Stark Sands) teams up with a drag queen (Billy Porter), sometimes turns into a sermon. But it's hard to resist the audience-hugging charisma of the songs (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Matilda the Musical' The most satisfying and subversive musical ever to come out of Britain. Directed by Matthew Warchus, with a book by Dennis Kelly and addictive songs by Tim Minchin, this adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel is an exhilarating tale of empowerment, told from the perspective of that most powerless group, little children (2:35). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Motown: The Musical' A dramatically slapdash but musically vibrant joy ride through the glory days of the Detroit music label founded by Berry Gordy. Mr. Gordy's book is sketchy and obvious -- you want to plug your ears whenever the music stops. But the music is, of course, some of the greatest R&B ever recorded, and the performers mostly electric (2:40). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Isherwood)
'Pippin' Diane Paulus sends in the acrobats for her exhaustingly energetic revival of Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson's 1972 musical. As for the 99-pound story at the center of this muscle-bound spectacle -- the one about the starry-eyed son of Charlemagne (Matthew James Thomas) -- that's there too, if you look hard. With Patina Miller and a delightful Andrea Martin (2:35). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Soul Doctor' The story of Shlomo Carlebach (Eric Anderson), the folk-singing rabbi who made a splash in the 1960s (and befriended Nina Simone, played by the elegant Amber Iman), makes for an odd and mostly hackneyed musical, despite the use of his often lovely music, set to overly drippy lyrics by David Schechter and a similar book by the director, Daniel S. Wise (2:30). Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (800) 432-7780, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'The Trip to Bountiful' Michael Wilson's slow-handed staging of Horton Foote's 1953 drama about an old woman's journey into the past is most notable for its remarkable star, Cicely Tyson, who seems thoroughly rejuvenated by her return to Broadway. The supporting cast includes Vanessa Williams, Leon Addison Brown and Adepero Oduye (2:10). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
Off Broadway
'Around the World in 80 Days' This stage version of the Jules Verne novel is an odd combination of steampunk and vaudeville. The actors' shameless mugging grows annoying after a while, but the pace stays brisk and the energy level high (2:00). New Theater at 45th Street, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, aroundtheworldinnyc.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Bill W. and Dr. Bob' Making the story of the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous 99 percent preachiness-free is quite an accomplishment. Samuel Shem and Janet Surrey's purpose-driven script, which never forgets the humor of the human experience, goes a long way toward making this a satisfying revival (2:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, billwanddrbob.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'Breakfast With Mugabe' To his critics in the West, the Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe is an election-rigger, a thug who uses past victimhood to justify further oppression. To Dr. Peric, a white psychiatrist, he is just another patient. That is the premise of Fraser Grace's trenchant, magnificently acted play, inspired by news reports that Mr. Mugabe did seek counsel from a white psychiatrist despite his lifelong image as one opposed to white authority figures. What follows is less a cooperative, therapeutic relationship than an unwinking power struggle (1:30). Alice Griffin Jewel Box Theater, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, breakfastwithmugabe.com. (Catherine Rampell)
&#x2605; 'Buyer & Cellar' Jonathan Tolins has concocted an irresistible one-man play from the most peculiar of fictitious premises -- an underemployed Los Angeles actor goes to work in Barbra Streisand's Malibu, Calif., basement -- allowing the playwright to ruminate with delicious wit and perspicacity on the solitude of celebrity, the love-hate attraction between gay men and divas, and the melancholy that lurks beneath narcissism. In the capable hands of the director Stephen Brackett and the wickedly charming actor Michael Urie, this seriously funny slice of absurdist whimsy creates the illusion of a stage filled with multiple people, all of them with their own droll point of view (1:30). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (David Rooney)
'The Cheaters Club' The latest from the Amoralists is a murky swamp of a gothic drama, (over) written and directed by Derek Ahonen, about New York siblings who head south for a weekend of adultery and find themselves involved in spooky doings in ghost-ridden Savannah, Ga. (2:30). Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (866) 811-4111, theamoralists.com. (Isherwood)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). Fridays and Saturdays only. St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
'Cuff Me: The Fifty Shades of Grey Musical Parody' What can I possibly say that isn't said by the title of this production? Here's one thing: It's not exactly great theater, but I'd still rather see ''Cuff Me'' than read the novel upon which it's based (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Claudia La Rocco)
'Harbor' Family and children are on the playwright Chad Beguelin's mind in this comedy about a gay couple and the manipulative sister who came to stay. ''Harbor'' doesn't quite succeed as social satire -- the humor often feels overfamiliar and the sister's quips about gayness start to grate the audience as well as their intended targets. But the play, a Primary Stages production, does better as a study of characters realigning family loyalties in a changing world (2:00). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (Rachel Saltz)
'It's Just Sex' Jeff Gould's lightweight comedy, a long-running hit in Los Angeles, is about three married couples whose party turns into an evening of spouse-swapping and postcoital navel-gazing (metaphorically). The cast is personable, but the script's only deep thought is that if women were told they could talk only to one person for the rest of their lives, they would understand why sexual fidelity is so stifling for men (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
'Me and Jezebel' Kelly Moore (that's Mr. Kelly Moore) is great fun to watch as Bette Davis in Elizabeth Fuller's real-life ''Man Who Came to Dinner'' story. Too bad Ms. Fuller, who plays herself, isn't really an actress. This comedy about a movie star taking over the guest room and the lives of a Connecticut family one month in 1985 is admirably self-deprecating (1:45). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 921-7862, ticketmaster.com. (Gates)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Two-Character Play' Playing strung-out sibling theater troupers in Tennessee Williams's rarely seen fever dream of an eternal folie à deux, Amanda Plummer and Brad Dourif don't just strike sparks. They're a raging conflagration that keeps changing form and direction. Gene David Kirk directs this revival of a demented, messy and oddly affecting self-portrait from an American master (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Unbroken Circle' Eve Plumb, a k a Jan of ''The Brady Bunch,'' demonstrates a flair for grown-up comedy as a born-again Christian with drinking and divorce habits in James Wesley's comic drama. Too bad the production is uncertainly paced and a little unpolished, because this story of a 1970s Texas family dealing with the death of an abusive patriarch has a lot going for it (1:50). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
&#x2605; 'The Weir' This first-rate revival of Conor McPherson's play gathers a group of friends as they tell ghost stories to drive away a loneliness than can be even more frightening (1:30). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Ken Jaworowski)
Off Off Broadway
'Avi Hoffman's Still Jewish After All These Years' Avi Hoffman's 75 minutes of songs and reminiscences is sometimes no more than warm and cabaret-cozy, but it has its moments, like a powerful performance of ''Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?'' and a lovely tribute to his father (1:30). Stage 72, 158 West 72nd Street, Manhattan, (800) 838-3006, stage72.com. (Gates)
&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended. A guided tour of Wonderland, created by Third Rail Projects, leads its participants through a series of rooms and an interactive evening of dance, poetry, food and drink (2:00). The Kingsland Ward at St. John's, 195 Maujer Street, near Humboldt Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 374-5196, thenshefell.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Vaudevillians' The drag performer Jinkx Monsoon (real name: Jerick Hoffer) and her accompanist, Major Scales (Richard Andriessen) turn a simple conceit into a hilarious evening. They are vaudeville performers who were frozen in an avalanche in the 1920s. Thawed out in the present, they find that many of their songs -- ''I Will Survive,'' for instance -- have been repurposed by more recent performers. They reclaim them, vaudeville style (1:25). Laurie Beechman Theater at the West Bank Cafe, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 352-3101, SpinCycleNYC.com. (Genzlinger)
'Wanda's Monster' Making Books Sing, which turns children's books into musicals, has adapted Eileen Spinelli's 2002 picture book about Wanda, a little girl who knows that a monster lives in her closet. Barbara Zinn Krieger, who wrote the script, has transformed Wanda's Granny -- the only adult who acknowledges the truth of Wanda's perception -- from a sensible soul into a kick-out-the-jams rocker. This characterization works beautifully with the show's upbeat score and lyrics by the children's pop star Laurie Berkner. This charming production brings home a point worth considering at any age: embrace what you fear, and you just may find a friend (1:00). Vineyard Theater, 109 East 15th Street, (646) 601-1406, wandasmonster.com. (Laurel Graeber)

'My Name Is Asher Lev' (closes on Sunday) Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place: the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic neighborhood in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30).

&#x2605; 'Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812' (closes on Monday) Dave Malloy's transporting pop opera dramatizes an emotionally potent slice of Tolstoy's ''War and Peace.'' Rachel Chavkin directs a superb young cast who bring the loves and losses of 19th-century Russian aristocrats to vibrant, intimate life in a stylish cabaret setting expressly built for the production (2:30). Kazino, West 13th Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (877) 704-2821, thegreatcometof1812.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Potted Potter' (closes on Sunday) With no new Harry Potter adventures to pore over, what's a Muggle in need of a fix to do? One answer: this gloriously goofy parody by Daniel Clarkson and Jefferson Turner, which compresses a retelling of the seven books into 70 minutes, complete with a game of Quidditch. Clearly the two comics attended Professor Flitwick's charms class, because they cast the perfect spell over the audience: reductio ad absurdum (1:10).

&#x2605; Summer Shorts 2013 (Series A) (closes on Friday) The first set in this year's edition of short plays at 59E59 Theaters -- a tasty and astringent foray into show-business rivalry by Neil LaBute, an imagining of Sarah Palin's job interview with John McCain by Lucas Hnath and a fairy tale satire by Tina Howe -- is consistently entertaining without dramatic histrionics or knee-slapping hilarity (1:45). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Andy Webster)
Summer Shorts 2013 (Series B) (closes on Saturday) The three comedies in Series B of 59E59 Theater's annual roundup of short plays are a mixed bag. Marian Fontana's heartfelt, if predictable, ''Falling Short'' has great one-liners but mines familiar territory to win sympathy for its online-dating heroine; Paul Weitz's ''Change'' lampoons drug burnouts and the bourgeoisie in such scrupulously equal measure that its criticism of the characters neutralizes itself. But Alan Zweibel's ''Pine Cone Moment'' -- about lovers in their autumn years haunted by their dead spouses -- is a deliciously goofy, romantic and sometimes joyously antic confection. You'll leave the theater smiling (1:45) 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Webster)
'Timmy the Great' (closes on Sunday) The title character is a 9-year-old who attains the throne of the Kingdom of Hearts in this ambitious family musical by Sandra Hochman, Stavo Craft and Gary Kupper. The tunes (by Mr. Kupper) and the cast are excellent, but the story sprawls, with the most interesting plotline in the second act, when King Timmy gives all children the rights of adults, and vice versa. As enjoyable as the show can be, you can't help feeling that buried in its hour and three-quarters of sketches, jokes, songs and vaudeville routines, a smart, funny 60-minute musical is dying to get out (1:45). Theater for the New City, 155 First Avenue, at Ninth Street, East Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Graeber)

HEADLINE: A Regents Chief Determined to Avoid the 'Fray'

BYLINE: By REEVE HAMILTON. 
rhamilton@texastribune.org

 BODY:
After Paul L. Foster was named chairman of the University of Texas System Board of Regents in August, Charles Miller, a Houston businessman who had served in that position for more than three years, sent him a note.
''I told him it's an easy job,'' Mr. Miller said. ''You just have to solve difficult problems 24/7 and spend the rest of your time putting out the resulting fires.''
Mr. Foster, of El Paso, is no slouch. His predilection for hard work began with a paper route at age 11 and developed during summers as a teenager laboring in the New Mexico oil fields where his father worked. Now the executive chairman of Western Refining, a company he formed in 1997, Mr. Foster is a self-made billionaire.
Still, as Mr. Foster recently said of his new post with the U.T. System, ''In terms of the scope and magnitude of the job, it's probably the biggest job I've ever had.'' 
And expectations could not be much higher.
For the 30 months that Mr. Foster's predecessor, Gene Powell, served as chairman, the U.T. System board's internal relationships and those with the administration of its flagship university and state lawmakers seemed to have deteriorated steadily, with charges and countercharges over issues including rising tuition costs and governance style. Many hope that a change at the top can turn things around.
Lawmakers have accused certain people on the nine-member Board of Regents of engaging in a ''witch hunt'' against William Powers Jr., president of the University of Texas at Austin. During the recent legislative session, restrictions on the board's spending authority were added to the state budget. And a legislative committee is considering whether to proceed with impeachment proceedings against one regent, Wallace Hall of Dallas.
(The University of Texas at Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune. Mr. Foster is a major donor to The Tribune.)
''Something needs to change,'' said State Senator Kirk Watson, Democrat of Austin. ''I'm not indicating who is right or wrong, but I don't know if it's ever good for there to be this much controversy between the governing body of a system and the Legislature. Sometimes a simple change in leadership in any organization can make a change in the tone and tenor of the way things go.''
Mr. Foster recently completed his first six-year term on the board and was confirmed for a second term this year after a legislative hearing lasting hours in which one lawmaker urged him and his fellow board members to ''move beyond the controversy.''
Mr. Foster said he remained committed to that. ''As chairman, I'm going to try to provide leadership in the best way I know how,'' he said. ''In general, that has involved trying to build consensus in various areas and trying to identify the best path forward. So I'm determined that I'm not going to get dragged into the fray here.''
This represents something of a contrast with Mr. Powell's style, which Mr. Powell, a San Antonio businessman, readily acknowledged.
''In every organization I've ever run, from the time I was about 17 years old, I've always had this kind of discord,'' he said. ''The reason is because I'm always pushing. When you are pushing people beyond their comfort limits, you get some discord.''
Despite the tensions, the regents ticked off a number of accomplishments under the leadership of Mr. Powell, who will remain as the board's vice chairman.
For example, the system began the process of merging two universities to create a major institution in South Texas and the board dedicated money to a new medical school planned for Austin.
Gov. Rick Perry, who appointed each regent, has compared the board's struggle to the Battle of the Bulge. In March, via e-mail, he encouraged a small group of regents, including Mr. Hall and Mr. Foster, to ''stay focused and team-oriented.''
In a statement this week, a spokeswoman said the governor hoped that Mr. Foster would continue the work of Mr. Powell's tenure, which the former chairman jokingly described as ''the best of times and the worst of times.'' Mr. Powell said he never felt an obligation to rein in the other regents to operate as a more unified board.
Mr. Foster said he was not sure he had much legal recourse for demanding that regents behave a certain way. ''I think it's more in terms of leadership style: trying to build consensus and trying to get people all rolling in the same direction,'' he said.
But James R. Huffines, who served two separate terms as board chairman for a total of nearly five years, said there was more to it than that. ''Any chairman of any public board has certain levels of authority and power that can keep the board focused in a single direction,'' he said, adding that he believed Mr. Foster ''will do an excellent job.''
As for Mr. Miller, he believes the onus for calming the waters falls on the Legislature, which he criticized for focusing too much on the regents' activities while failing to approve a popular plan to issue bonds for campus construction projects.
Throughout the session, legislators expressed support for Mr. Powers and concern that regents might try to remove him from U.T.-Austin. During his confirmation hearing, Mr. Foster admitted that Mr. Powers ''has been a challenge to the board at times.''
He said he still had that concern but intended to leave the evaluation of presidents up to the system's chancellor, Francisco G. Cigarroa, who he said ''has the support and trust of the board.''
''It's not my role to second-guess. It's not my role to criticize,'' Mr. Foster said. ''I am concerned about it because it's the issue that is causing all the controversy, but I'm not going to weigh in on it.''
He did weigh in on the investigation of Mr. Hall, who is being scrutinized by the Texas House Select Committee on Transparency in State Agency Operations, in part for demanding access to thousands of documents at U.T.-Austin. In a recent letter to the committee, Mr. Hall's lawyers said that his efforts have been ''bringing to light acts, omissions, misrepresentations and favoritism within the U.T. System that some would strongly prefer remain undisclosed.''
''I think it's almost ironic that you have a committee on transparency and you have a regent who is being chastised pretty badly for what appears to be an effort to create transparency,'' Mr. Foster said. ''I don't think the objectives on either side are very different from one another. I think there's a way to get everybody focused on what's important.''
Through his philanthropic efforts, Mr. Foster has demonstrated the extent to which he values higher education. In addition to giving millions to his alma mater, Baylor University, and to the University of Texas at El Paso, he made the largest single gift to the Texas Tech University System that it has ever received: $50 million for a medical school in El Paso that now bears his name.
''I just think the most significant driver for economic development and the prosperity of a region or a state or the country is the level of education, particularly higher ed,'' Mr. Foster said. ''Statistically, it bears out over and over and over.''
More than 200,000 students attend the 15 institutions in the U.T. System.
''It touches a lot of lives and has a huge impact on the future of the state,'' Mr. Foster said. ''This is a position from which you can have a great impact and, hopefully, with good results, a positive one.''

HEADLINE: The Mayoral Candidates on the Parks

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO

 BODY:
The parks system in New York City expanded and -- many would argue -- flourished under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, with the creation of nearly 800 acres of new parkland, reclaimed stretches of waterfront and myriad park renovations.
But the administration also further blurred the line between private and public, rankling park advocates and residents alike on issues like the growing clout of park conservancies and a proposal to erect a soccer stadium in the heart of Flushing Meadows-Corona Park.
The next mayor not only will inherit those flash points, but also must decide whether the streetscape will continue on its current trajectory, with more room for bicyclists and pedestrians. Though less contentious than bike lanes, pedestrian plazas have emerged across the city, with many more planned. Some credit the plazas with making New York a more livable city, but others say they worsen traffic.
The New York Times asked the leading candidates in contested mayoral primaries three questions about parks. The description of their positions is drawn from their responses and previous statements. 
Should the city allow Major League Soccer to build a stadium on 13 acres in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park?
Bill de Blasio (D), who called Flushing Meadows-Corona Park the ''jewel of the Queens park system,'' criticized the idea of putting a stadium there. He argued that the city had already ceded too much parkland to what he termed ''corporate entities,'' and called the stadium idea a ''bad deal for New Yorkers.''
John C. Liu (D), who lives in Queens, has consistently opposed a stadium plan for the park, most recently at a candidates' forum in June. In explaining his position, he said that ''scarce public space'' should be kept accessible to the public and argued against privatization of parkland.
Christine C. Quinn (D) at a candidates' forum in June deferred to a councilwoman, Julissa Ferreras, whose district includes Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. In response to the Times questionnaire, Ms. Quinn said that she had not taken a firm position because a formal stadium proposal had yet to be submitted. However, she said that the city should build on parkland ''only when necessary'' and only when ''an equal or greater amount of open space'' replaces it.
William C. Thompson Jr. (D) was noncommittal about a possible stadium, saying that the city needed to ''proceed with caution.'' A stadium in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park would raise environmental concerns while reducing parkland for Queens residents, he said. He adopted a wait-and-see approach, concluding that the city must ''monitor the situation very carefully'' in order to maximize the financial benefit and expand parkland.
Anthony D. Weiner (D) said he was ''open to the idea'' of building a soccer stadium that would both host a professional team -- Major League Soccer recently announced the formation of its 20th club -- and provide more places for Queens residents to play soccer. When the soccer league unveiled its plan last fall, it offered to renovate nine soccer fields in the vicinity of the stadium.
John A. Catsimatidis (R) said other sites should be considered for the stadium, calling it the ''judicious thing to do'' before parkland is developed. In contrast to Mayor Bloomberg's strong support of the contentious stadium plan, he said that the city should not take sides, but should be an ''honest broker.'' Ultimately, Mr. Catsimatidis said he would support a soccer stadium in the Queens park, as long as it had community support and feedback from local residents.
Joseph J. Lhota (R) rejected the stadium plan outright. While he supports bringing Major League Soccer to New York, he said that a park was not an appropriate location for such a stadium and he urged the league to look at other sites in order to preserve parkland.
What changes would you make to the parks financing system? Would you limit the role of park conservancies in the interests of equity?
Reiterating an idea he has championed during the campaign, Mr. de Blasio said that he would like to see well-financed conservancies contribute money to a neighborhood parks alliance. The alliance would then distribute it to neglected parks in low-income neighborhoods and in boroughs outside Manhattan. ''Every New Yorker deserves access to well-maintained parkland close to their homes,'' he said.
Mr. Liu called for more equitable financing for parks, but stopped short of calling for wealthy parks to help needy ones. ''It is great that New Yorkers want to contribute to parks, but we cannot simply rely on private funding,'' he said. That, he said, leads to the ''current situation'' in which parks in low-income communities lack resources.
In an indirect reference to the High Line and Brooklyn Bridge Park, Ms. Quinn said that the city should shift its focus from ''destination parks'' to ''revitalizing and restoring parks in our neighborhoods.'' She would ''baseline'' financing for parks to make budgets more stable, a change from the practice under Mayor Bloomberg, when budgets for park maintenance contracted while capital financing for parks ballooned.
Mr. Thompson said he would expand the city's focus on parks beyond ''central Manhattan'' to other boroughs, where a vast majority of parks lack conservancies, but he did not call for the redistribution of wealth between parks. Rather, he said he would protect parkland through more conservation and the restoration of maintenance budgets.
Mr. Weiner expressed support for park conservancies, which supplement city budgets through private fund-raising and also organize volunteers. Most conservancies are in affluent neighborhoods, and Mr. Weiner said that he would not limit them but would try to ''expand their reach to less glamorous parks'' throughout the five boroughs.
Mr. Catsimatidis called for more public-private partnerships when it comes to parks, declaring that ''every park should have'' a conservancy-type group. He said he would leverage private financing wherever possible and encourage private investment in public enterprises, including parks.
Mr. Lhota praised the network of conservancies, saying they had been ''invaluable in sharing the costs'' of enhancing and maintaining certain city parks. He said he would like to see a citywide conservancy that attracts donations to benefit all parks. And to encourage more volunteerism, he would offer tax incentives to New Yorkers who spend a certain amount of time each year sprucing up parks.
Would you support the city's plan to create more pedestrian plazas on streets currently open to automobile traffic?
Mr. de Blasio lauded the pedestrian plaza concept, crediting the car-free zones with easing congestion, improving safety and enhancing neighborhoods. He singled out Times Square and Herald Square in Midtown Manhattan, two of the most prominent such plazas, where office workers can sit and eat lunch in the middle of Broadway, calling them ''wildly successful.'' And he said that a ''livable streets agenda'' should expand to all five boroughs.
Mr. Liu expressed support for pedestrian plazas, but he warned that the city needed to be sensitive to the needs and desires of residents and businesses. ''These projects should not be implemented without proper community outreach,'' he said.
Ms. Quinn said that she supported the expansion of pedestrian plazas, but only after receiving community comments. In 2011, the City Council approved measures supported by Ms. Quinn that require the city to consult with a variety of agencies and community boards before creating new pedestrian plazas and bike lanes, and to make data available on safety and traffic impacts.
Mr. Thompson praised pedestrian plazas for improving traffic safety and voiced support for adding more in the boroughs beyond Manhattan, saying that they ''deserved the same benefits and resources.''
When Mayor Bloomberg and transportation officials introduced pedestrian plazas to the city's streetscape, they hailed the spaces for their ability to reduce traffic and cut air pollution. But Mr. Weiner appears unconvinced, saying that he would support more plazas, but not at the ''cost of additional congestion and pollution.''
Mr. Catsimatidis signaled a reluctance to approve additional pedestrian plazas, pending a hard look at their costs and benefits. ''Decisions like these need to be made on a case-by-case basis,'' he said, adding that they ''may be appropriate in some areas, but not in others.''
Mr. Lhota said that any more plazas must await careful study of the effect of existing plazas on traffic patterns. ''Our economy and quality of life hinge greatly on our ability to move freely throughout the city,'' he said. ''Any plans to eliminate precious road space must be incorporated in an overall transportation strategy.''

HEADLINE: The Central Challenge in U.S. Health Policy

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Without wealthier households sharing more costs of health care, many Americans will continue to find health care unaffordable, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
"Health Care Costs Climb Moderately, Survey Says" read the headline in The New York Times last week. It appears that health insurance premiums for job-based family coverage rose "only" 4 percent between 2012 and 2013, although still twice as fast as did wages. 
The survey in question is the Kaiser Family Foundation's annual survey of employment-based health insurance, widely viewed as a gold mine for anyone seeking information on that part of the American health system. The full report is easily accessible, or readers may prefer to read just the summary or browse through the fine group of charts the foundation provides. Here is a telling chart from that pack. 
The premiums shown in this chart are in current dollars, meaning they are not adjusted for inflation. They do not reflect a common benefit package. Furthermore, they are only averages that differ substantially from the experiences of individual companies.

For example, as is shown in Figure 2 (which is a slightly different format of Exhibit 1.7 in Kaiser's full report), 21 percent of the companies in the Kaiser survey paid premiums in excess of $19,387 for families and in excess of $7,062 for singles in 2013 - a hefty amount. At the other end, about a fifth of the companies in the sample paid less than $13,225 for family coverage and less than $4,708 for single coverage. The other bars in the chart can be similarly interpreted. 
There is also apt to be considerable intercompany variance not only in the level of premiums but also in the year-to-year growth of premiums. That will be especially so among small companies that are experience-rated - which means their premiums are based on the average health status of only their few employees. Many of these companies experienced premium growth in the double digits last year, as has happened every year in the past. 
At the moment, there is great uncertainty about the premium increase between 2013 and 2014 that these small companies may experience as a result of the onset of community rating, beginning in 2014.
The Kaiser surveys include detailed data on the contributions that employees make out of their paychecks toward the premiums for their coverage, but they do not include data on the out-of-pocket spending for health care by employees and their families through deductibles, co-insurance and exclusions of health care services from coverage.
The benefit consulting firm Milliman annually publishes its Milliman Medical Index on the average total cost of health care for a typical American family of four under age 65, covered by a preferred provider plan, or P.P.O. That index includes not only the employment-based health insurance premium paid by employer and employee but also an estimate of the family's out-of-pocket spending. In other words, if estimates total annual health spending for the hypothetical family. A time series of the index is shown in Figure 3, below. These figures, too, are in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation.
The Milliman index is not directly comparable to the Kaiser data, because it is a composite actuarial estimate for a particular hypothetical family of four and a particular form of insurance policy and benefit package whose estimated average premium is higher than the Kaiser average. These actuarial estimates (again, in non-inflation-adjusted dollars) are based on the large database of coverage of the firm's clients. 
According to Milliman's report, the total cost of $22,030 in 2013 is composed of a total premium for insurance coverage of $18,430, of which the employer is estimated to contribute $12,886 and the employee $5,544. The rest represents out-of-pocket spending of $3,600.
Although not directly comparable, taken together these two data series raise the question of how many American families could afford this kind of health spending strictly with their own financial resources, if one took the extreme position that health care is a private consumption good for which American households themselves should be financially responsible. I hasten to add that I do not know anyone who actually holds that extreme position; the argument is and always has been only over how extensive such support should be.
But the numbers are daunting just the same, if one contrasts them with data on the distribution of household money income (after taxes and transfers) by income group, as is done in Figure 4. 
The data in Figure 4 comes from Table A-2 (Page 39) of the Census Bureau's report "Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage in the United States: 2011." It is seen that in 2011, 20 percent of American households had incomes below $20,262. Although the figure includes households of various sizes, including singles, it is nevertheless a small sum to absorb even Kaiser's premium numbers for single coverage. Median household income in 2011 was $50,054, meaning that close to 50 percent of households had an income below that number. 
The data in Figure 4 is for 2011 only (in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation). While the nominal median household income in the United States has increased substantially since 1975, in constant-dollar terms of 2011 it has been remarkably and disappointingly flat, as is shown by the line for "real income" in Figure 5 below. That chart is based on Table H-6 in the Census Bureau report "Historical Income Tables: Households." 
As Figure 5 indicates, after 2008 nominal median household income in the United States has been flat, while real income has fallen somewhat, by about 8 percent (see Figure 1 in this report). It is not clear when real median income will return again to its previous high. Most of the growth in real gross domestic product in the last several decades has actually accrued to households in the top quintile of the income distribution and, within that quintile, to the top 1 percent. 
The gist of the preceding array of data is that even under what we now call "moderate" growth in health care costs, stagnating incomes for millions of American households will put American health care as we have come to know it out of their financial reach, unless they receive substantial help from households in the upper third or so of the household income distribution. 
This central political dilemma in American health policy - leave health care to those who can afford it or increase tax revenues to broaden coverage - will continue as far as the eye can see. A good part of the current shouting match over the Affordable Care Act expresses anger over this dilemma, and it will not subside even after the act has been fully put in place.

HEADLINE: Today in Small Business: Optimism!

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: Where is this optimism coming from? (You won&#8217;t find it at Nevada&#8217;s brothels.) Why Twitter&#8217;s conversation view is a big deal. Take a vacation!

Management

        
Jesse Lipson explains how your Labor Day vacation can improve your performance at work: "Bottom line: Vacation - or, if the word scares you, call it 'creative recharge' - is a critical component of working at a high level. It stimulates parts of your brain that you don't use in a typical workday. It keeps you fresh. It helps you generate new ideas. And if nothing else, it forces the people you work with to build systems that can operate smoothly without you."

Ruslan Kogan explains the secret power that prompts customers to pick crowded restaurants over empty ones: "When we walk into a store and see lots of people lining up at the cash register to buy something, our brain automatically tells us two things: This place must be safe to buy from. There are lots of people who have assessed this store and concluded that it's a good store to buy from. The deals in this store must be pretty good because lots of people are buying, and they wouldn't be buying if the deals weren't great."
Social Media

        
Om Malik explains why Twitter's new conversations view is a big deal: "By turning tweets into conversations, the company has introduced the ultimate Facebook-like object - status/comments/conversations - into its stream. And when that happens, Twitter will have turned the 140-character limit into the ultimate payload-carrying, content-object missile."

HEADLINE: Oral Infections Causing More Hospitalizations

BYLINE: CATHERINE SAINT LOUIS


HIGHLIGHT: Surprising numbers of patients are being hospitalized with serious, sometimes fatal tooth abscesses, a new study finds. 

 BODY:
Left untreated, a serious tooth abscess can eventually kill. 
In 2007, Deamonte Driver, a 12-year-old boy in Maryland, died after bacteria from an abscessed tooth spread to his brain. The case drew widespread media attention, and his is the cautionary tale cited whenever politicians and advocates .
But a new study suggests that deaths from these preventable infections may not be as rare as once thought and that the number of Americans hospitalized with them may be on the rise. 
Studies have shown that dental problems account for . The new analysis, published in the September issue of the Journal of Endodontics, focused on patients who had to be hospitalized because of an infection of the tip of the tooth's root, called a periapical abscess. It is a common consequence of untreated tooth decay, and it can be dangerous if it spreads.
After reviewing national patient data from 2000 to 2008, researchers in Boston found that the people hospitalized for dental abscesses increased by more than 40 percent, to 8,141 in 2008 from 5,757 in 2000. Some 66 patients died after they were hospitalized, according to the new analysis.
"We have not had verification before of the number of deaths," said Dr. Frank Catalanotto, chairman of the department of community dentistry and behavioral science at the University of Florida College of Dentistry, who was not involved in the report. "The seriousness of dental infections that go untreated or are treated too late is a bigger problem than we had estimated."
When money and access are not problems, an abscessed tooth can easily be treated with a root canal or an extraction. But increasingly, Americans rely on hospital emergency rooms for dental care, instead of regular dentist visits - a trend exacerbated by a lack of insurance coverage and trouble paying out of pocket.
Last year, a Pew Charitable Trusts report estimated that preventable dental conditions, including abscessed teeth, were the primary reason for 830,590 emergency room visits in 2009 - a 16 percent increase from 2006.
Until now, it has been unclear just how many patients end up hospitalized specifically for abscessed teeth or how much they cost the health care system. According to the new analysis, that figure was $858.9 million, after adjustment for inflation, from 2000 to 2008.
"That's what we are paying instead of paying up front, and it's such a waste, one with a high human cost," said Shelly Gehshan, the director of the Pew Children's Dental Campaign. "Dental insurance is eroding little by little, and affordability of dental care is something the industry has not addressed."
A periapical abscess is a "rare event, and to have significant morbidity is even rarer," said Dr. Bruce Dye, a dental epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Still, the number of patients hospitalized for them is "creeping up."
But Dr. Dye cautioned that the analysis did not address whether patients were able to afford dental care; some may have ended up at the emergency room for a complication after receiving a root canal from a dentist. "You can't make the statement that this is a sign of increased problem of access to care," he said.
Medicaid coverage for routine dental services for adults varies widely by state; Medicare does not cover routine dental care. The programs do pay for hospital stays, however, and the new study found that Medicare paid for roughly 19 percent of hospitalizations for dental abscesses, while Medicaid shouldered 25 percent and private insurance plans paid for 33 percent.
In recent years, Dr. Samuel Dorn, a chairman of endodontics at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, said he had seen an increase in hospitalizations for dental abscesses.
"People put it off until they find their face all swollen or they can't breathe, and they run to the hospital," he said. "And that's when we have these emergent conditions."
His colleague Dr. Mark Wong, the chairman of oral surgery at the university, said residents' logs showed that in 2008, 273 "incision and drainage" procedures because of abscessed teeth were done in local hospitals. Last year, the number was 488; 248 patients were hospitalized.
"To call this an epidemic of dental infections we are seeing in major hospital environments and in our emergency rooms - it's not an overstatement," Dr. Wong said.
An acute abscess of an upper tooth can cause cheek swelling and, untreated, lead to a brain abscess or a sinus infection. If bacteria spread from an abscess in a lower tooth, the swelling can constrict the airway. Some patients underestimate how serious the condition can be.
"It's better to have it treated when it's treatable than to wait until it gets out of hand and is possibly life-threatening," said Dr. Gary R. Hartwell, the president of the American Association of Endodontists. The increase in hospitalizations is part of a sea change in dental care, he said: "Now it's reached a point unless something's bothering them or they've got pain, people say, 'I'm just not going to go to the dentist.'

HEADLINE: A Lesson for Boardroom Battles

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: A proxy battle involving an Israeli company listed in the United States could serve as a lesson for how the proxy access rule could be used as a weapon in boardroom battles. 

 BODY:
Proxy access may be dead in the United States, but it lives in Israel, to the great regret of Taro Pharmaceutical Industries. 
Taro is facing a proxy battle involving two external directors nominated by the asset management firm BlueMountain Capital Management. While unfortunate for Taro, it all shows an alternative universe of what, for better or worse, could have happened had proxy access been in place in the United States. 
Taro Pharmaceuticals is a $3 billion pharmaceutical company founded and organized under the laws of Israel. But like many other Israeli companies, it is not listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. Instead Taro's stock is listed and traded only on the New York Stock Exchange. 
As securities lawyers know, this creates hybrid regulation governing the company. Because Taro is a foreign-based company, a so-called foreign private issuer, it is exempt from many of the United States securities laws. This includes the proxy rules as well as quarterly reporting requirements for American companies. 
But it also means that Taro is still subject to Israeli rules governing companies incorporated there. 
And Israel has rules intended to give substantial protection to minority shareholders. Israeli companies must have two external directors selected by noncontrolling shareholders. These directors serve three year terms and have certain defined duties, including sitting on the companies' audit committee and signing off on any conflicted transactions with management or controlling shareholders. 
This is not so unusual, and the United States effectively requires that boards of public companies without controlling shareholders have a majority of independent directors. 
What is unusual is that Israel has adopted proxy access for these directors. 
Proxy access was a Securities and Exchange Commissionrule that allowed shareholderswho in the aggregate owned at least 3 percent of the company for at least three years to nominate up to 25 percent of a company's board. The kicker was that the company would have to include these names in its own proxy. This would spare the nominating shareholders the expense of hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, required to prepare and circulate their own separate proxy statement.
The idea was to hold boards and directors more accountable, something that many feel is lacking. A recent study I co-authored found that, after the financial crisis, directors of financial institutions had only a 0.99 percent greater chance of being ousted for poor performance. 
Proxy access was bitterly opposed by public companies and blockedby the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia on controversial grounds, namely that the S.E.C. had not conducted sufficient cost-benefit analysis of the rule. In the wake of the rule's defeat, the S.E.C. has moved on, and new proxy access rules are unlikely any time soon. 
The case of Taro highlights the potential benefits and possible problems of proxy access. Taro has a controlling shareholder: India-based Sun Pharmaceuticals, which owns 66.5 percent of Taro, a stake it acquired in 2010. 
In 2012, Sun offered to acquire the rest of Taro for $39.50 a share. The offer was approved by Taro's board, including its two external directors. The Taro board found Sun's offer to be fair. Notably, the final deal was a marked improvement over Sun's initial offer of $24.50.
Still, the proposed buyout was criticized as being underpriced. Using these arguments, the investment funds IsZo Capital Management and Black Horse Capital Advisors successfully forcedTaro and Sun to cancel the transaction. 
One of the main reasons IsZo and Black Horse succeeded was another protection Israel has for minority shareholders. This is a flat-out requirement that any buyout by a controlling shareholder be approved by the majority of the noncontrolling shareholders. (This feature is also being employed to good effect by shareholders in the Dell buyout). Taro and Sun simply couldn't get enough shareholders to approve the buyout under this threshold. 
IsZo and Black Horse were right. Taro's stock now trades at about $65 a share. 
Now, BlueMountain is asking for accountability. BlueMountain is not normally an activist investor, but in this case, it wants to replace the external directors who signed off on the failed buyout. 
The reason is simple: as IsZo stated in supportof BlueMountain's nominees, "We do not believe that the incumbents should be rewarded." 
And BlueMountain, which only owns 1.5 percent of the shares, is doing this in a simple way. It is using proxy access to nominate two new candidates as external directors. Taro has opposed this nomination and stated that it is not sure whether the candidates have adequate "financial and accounting expertise." 
Taro did not reply to an e-mail request for comment.
But Taro is on its back foot. First, BlueMountain doesn't have to do much to oust the old external directors. Under Israeli law, the external directors need to get a majority of the minority vote as well as a majority of all the votes to be elected. 
There is a twist. If that vote is not obtained, the candidates can be rejected if 2 percent of shares vote against them. 
The consequence is that if a majority of the minority shareholders representing at least 2 percent of the shares vote against Taro's candidates, then re-election of Taro's candidates will be blocked even if Taro's own candidates don't win. If this happens, there would be no external directors on Taro's board.
This would put Taro at a disadvantage, because it would need the approval of the external directors to sign off on conflict transactions, including any future potential buyout by Sun. Without external directors, no such transaction could take place. 
BlueMountain is also aware of this and while it would like its own candidates to serve as external directors on the board, it has also said that it would settle for this type of stalemate. 
Taro's shareholder meeting on these nominations is scheduled for Sept. 12. But there are already lessons for the United States. 
Proxy access was opposed because many companies thought it would be too disruptive to their business. Many other people, though, thought that the requirement for a three-year holding period would mean it would go unused. 
The case of Taro shows that there are likely to be shareholders who will use proxy access and that, yes indeed, it will be used disruptively to oust directors. In Taro's case, the provision is being used to hold directors accountable. 
Still, this does not mean that proxy access is a good thing. It may arguably be good in Taro's case, but in today's activist environment, it could easily be used by hedge funds and institutional investors for less-useful purposes. 
In the United States, proxy access is dead, but like zombies, regulatory ideas have a habit of being hard to kill. If proxy access does re-emerge, we will have some 120 Israeli companies that are like Taro - listed in the United States but with Israeli governance - as an example.

HEADLINE: With Britain Haunted by Iraq, a Harsh Lesson for Cameron

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE and STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
LONDON -- Humiliated by lawmakers over Syria, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain seems destined to cut a lesser figure, weakened both at home and abroad by a self-made debacle that has also highlighted his war-weary country's reluctance to get involved with another American project in the Middle East.
No British prime minister in memory has sought and failed to win support from his legislators for military action, and the rebuff of Mr. Cameron late Thursday means the United States will have to intervene without its closest security and intelligence ally. In a reversal of the situation in Iraq, it may be France, Britain's neighbor and rival, that gives European military and political cover to President Obama.
In the wake of the shocking parliamentary defeat, Mr. Cameron's closest political friend, the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, conceded that the vote would provoke a period of ''national soul-searching'' about Britain's role in the world. But he also cautioned against exaggerating the impact of the vote. ''I hope this doesn't become a moment when we turn our back on all of the world's problems,'' he said. 
The growing isolation of Britain appears on the European level, too. After more than a decade of involvement in conflicts -- and ground down by a weak economy -- the British public is increasingly skeptical about its membership in the European Union, whose single currency is just starting to recover from a near-death experience.
Some of those Conservative politicians most critical of the European Union seem also to have little faith in the other pillar of Britain's postwar foreign policy -- its ''special relationship'' with the United States.
The Labour Party leader, Ed Miliband, put it this way to the BBC: ''I think being an ally with the United States and having a special relationship with the United States cannot simply be about doing what the American president says he wants you to do.''
Calling the reluctance to use military force abroad ''a pretty profound change,'' Malcolm Chalmers, research director at the Royal United Services Institute in London, which specializes in defense and security policy, said, ''It has the feeling of the post-Vietnam change in the United States.''
Mr. Chalmers saw ''a disconnect between the political elite and the public,'' adding: ''It's there on military intervention, it is certainly there on Europe and on immigration. There is a sense among the British public that we should look after ourselves rather than other people.''
In fact, the events that unfolded during the week were shaped by prosaic political miscalculation, with the leaders of all three main political parties misjudging the public mood and losing control of their parties. Mr. Cameron was probably encouraged by the fact that British lawmakers had supported military intervention in Libya in 2011, and thought he had a compromise deal with Mr. Miliband, for example, who discovered that his backbenchers would not accept it. In the end, both Mr. Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, leader of the Liberal Democrats, found themselves unable to keep their legislators in line, even on an essentially meaningless motion that authorized nothing.
Even if, in several months, it turns out that recent events have saved the country from an unwise military intervention, that will be of little comfort to Mr. Cameron. In those circumstances, his political opponents will be able to cast further doubt on the prime minister's judgment and claim that they -- not he -- deserve the credit for averting another foreign policy misstep.
The experience of Iraq hung over the debate. With a public discussion about the intelligence assessments, the work of United Nations weapons inspectors and the legal case for military action, few could miss the parallels with the invasion of Iraq. That war wrecked the premiership of the former Labour Party leader, Tony Blair, who was ridiculed as Washington's poodle and accused of misrepresenting intelligence about Saddam Hussein's supposed possession of weapons of mass destruction.
Even before military action in 2003, the prospect of invading Iraq was unpopular in Britain, with as many as one million protesters marching in opposition at one point. Mr. Miliband had not yet been elected to Parliament, and the fact that he never voted for military action was an important element in his campaign to become party leader.
Mr. Cameron was all too aware of the legacy of Iraq. His decision to recall Parliament from vacation, and to publish legal advice on the case for action and the intelligence assessment, were intended to demonstrate transparency and underline the difference between him and Mr. Blair.
Initially, Mr. Cameron wanted authorization for limited military strikes. After discussions with Mr. Miliband, he was forced to retreat, ending with a bland motion that promised a second vote after United Nations inspectors in Damascus had completed their work.
To the fury of Mr. Cameron's office, Mr. Miliband could not deliver in the face of hostility from Labour legislators. Many of them remembered being persuaded against their better judgment to support Mr. Blair on Iraq and, now in opposition, were in no mood to do Mr. Cameron a similar favor.
The anger over Mr. Miliband's stance surfaced after his speech when one Cameron aide -- identified by the Labour Party as the director of government communications, Craig Oliver -- agreed, in response to a question from a reporter, that Mr. Miliband had given ''succor to Assad.''
But Mr. Cameron also has problems within his own party. There is rumbling discontent among a minority of Conservatives over his leadership, particularly among those never reconciled to joining a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats.
The vote also reflected the diminished international status of Mr. Obama, who no longer enjoys the benefit of the doubt on foreign policy that existed at the start of his first term, Mr. Chalmers said. ''After Iraq and Afghanistan, there is much more questioning about the role of military force in discretionary operations in the Middle East,'' he said.
Nigel Sheinwald, a former British ambassador both to Brussels and Washington, said there would be some damage to Britain's standing, but nothing irreparable. ''There is no doubt that in any alliance reliability, dependability and predictability are all key facets,'' he said. ''Britain will have to find a way of restoring that reputation.''
But Mr. Sheinwald said that many of the issues raised in Britain will be familiar to President Obama from the American debate. ''Syria was an issue on which the West has struggled to get a coherent policy for the last two and a half years,'' he said. ''I don't think it is going, necessarily, to be the model for the future any more than Libya was.''

HEADLINE: Five Years After Chaos, Shares of Many Big Banks Are Still Struggling

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
FINANCIAL markets were nervous five years ago, as September 2008 began, but hopeful that the world would stabilize.
Two weeks later, Lehman Brothers failed and a panic began. The crisis demonstrated how interconnected the world financial system had become and how vulnerable even apparently healthy banks were when their competitors began to crumble. In the weeks that followed, most large banks around the world had to be bailed out. Their share prices plummeted. 
Since then, however, some big banks have performed much better than others -- a difference based to a significant extent on just how well, or badly, each bank had been run in the months and years leading up to the crisis.
The accompanying charts show the performance of 25 large banks around the world. As the crisis began, each of them ranked in the top 20 in the world in at least one of three measurements -- market capitalization, book value or total assets.
In the weeks and months that followed, all but one of them lost at least half of their market value, as measured in the local currency of the bank's primary market. The exception was a Chinese bank, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, whose shares lost less than a third of their value.
The charts also show the performance of the Bloomberg World Bank Index, which comprises more than 140 banks and has done better than most of the large bank stocks. This was a crisis where bigger was not necessarily better, and where some of the largest banks proved to be far from adequately capitalized, notwithstanding what their books had indicated before Lehman collapsed.
This spring, the world bank index got back to within 3 percent of its level at the end of August 2008, although it has since slipped back and is now 11 percent lower. Few of the large banks shown have done as well.
But a handful of banks turned out to be profitable long-term investments that August. Shares of both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo in the United States are now more than 40 percent higher than they were. Shares of two of the three Chinese banks shown -- Bank of China and China Construction Bank -- are higher now than they were five years ago, while the third is approximately unchanged. In Britain, HSBC is up about 13 percent, a much better performance than was shown by other large European banks. It did not hurt that HSBC had a significant presence in many developing countries, most of which rode out the recession reasonably well even though some have stumbled this year.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Some Banks Recover, Most Don't: Five years ago, the financial crisis was on the verge of getting much worse. Now, an index of bank stocks around the world has recovered most of the ground it lost. But most large banks are still down, some by significant amounts. (Sources: Bloomberg

HEADLINE: Chinese Chicken Processors Are Cleared to Ship to U.S.

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The Department of Agriculture on Friday approved four Chinese poultry processors to begin shipping a limited amount of meat to the United States, a move that is likely to add to the debate over food imports.
Initially, the companies will be allowed to export only cooked poultry products from birds raised in the United States and Canada. But critics predicted that the government would eventually expand the rules, so that chickens and turkeys bred in China could end up in the American market.
''This is the first step towards allowing China to export its own domestic chickens to the U.S.,'' said Tony Corbo, the senior lobbyist for Food and Water Watch, an advocacy group that works to promote food safety. 
The U.S.D.A.'s decision follows years of wrangling over the issue, and comes as Americans are increasingly focused on the origin of their food.
In recent years, imports have been the source of contamination, prompting broader worries about food safety. The Food and Drug Administration just released an analysis of imported spices, showing high levels of salmonella in coriander, oregano, sesame seeds and curry powder.
China does not have the best track record for food safety, and its chicken products in particular have raised questions. The country has had frequent outbreaks of deadly avian influenza, which it sometimes has been slow to report.
Recently, an F.D.A. investigation tied the deaths of more than 500 dogs and a handful of cats to chicken jerky treats that came from China. The treats, which were eventually recalled, additionally were blamed for sickening more than 2,500 animals.
The proposed sale of Smithfield Foods to Shuanghui International, a major Chinese food processor, has added to the industry scrutiny. In July, senators from both parties questioned Larry Pope, the chief executive of Smithfield, about the implications of his company's deal for food safety and United States employment.
Mr. Pope responded that the deal was intended to address the rising demand for meat in China and that American workers would be employed in that effort. ''This means increased capacity for U.S. producers, more jobs in processing and more exports for the U.S. economy,'' Mr. Pope said. ''At the same time, we will continue to supply our same high-quality, renowned products to U.S. consumers.''
The poultry trade between the United States and China has been contentious for years. Under the Bush administration, the U.S.D.A. moved to allow imports of chicken from China, which has banned imports of American beef since 2003 over worries about mad cow disease.
In response, Congress blocked Chinese chicken exports. China retaliated by slapping huge tariffs on American chicken. The fight ended up at the World Trade Organization, which ruled that the tariffs were too high.
After that, the U.S.D.A. then audited Chinese processing plants, giving its approval for them to process raw birds from the United States and Canada.
Under the new rules, the Chinese facilities will verify that cooked products exported to the United States came from American or Canadian birds. So no U.S.D.A. inspector will be present in the plants.
And because the poultry will be processed, it will not require country-of-origin labeling. Nor will consumers eating chicken noodle soup from a can or chicken nuggets in a fast-food restaurant know if the chicken came from Chinese processing plants.
''We certainly don't look forward to any more imports, but we also realize free trade is a two-way street,'' said Tom Super, spokesman for the National Chicken Council, which represents big chicken processors in the United States. ''We're hoping the Chinese will look a little more favorably on our chicken products and on other U.S. agricultural imports.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Spending and Income Rose a Faint 0.1% in July

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Consumers increased their spending just 0.1 percent in July from June, as their income rose by the same small percentage, the Commerce Department reported on Friday. 
After rising 0.3 percent in June, income was held back in part by steep government spending cuts that reduced federal workers' salaries. Overall wages and salaries tumbled $21.8 billion from June, with a third of the decline coming from forced furloughs of federal workers.
Consumers cut their spending on long-lasting manufactured goods, like cars and appliances. Overall spending had risen 0.6 percent in June.
The tepid gains suggested economic growth was off to a weak start for the quarter.
A measure of consumer confidence slipped this month from a six-year high in July, as Americans expressed less optimism about the coming months. Americans said they were less confident that the job market would improve, but more confident that their income would rise.
Consumer spending drives roughly 70 percent of economic activity. So the weak spending report led some economists to sound a more pessimistic note on growth in the current quarter.
''This is a disappointing report on a number of levels,'' said James Marple, senior economist at TD Economics. ''Prospects for a pickup in economic growth in the third quarter hinge on a broad-based acceleration in spending by households and business to offset the ongoing drag from government. The data for the first month of the quarter are not following this script.''
Several analysts said that economic growth was unlikely to match the 2.5 percent annual rate reported Thursday for the April-June quarter. That was more than twice the growth rate in the first quarter and far above an initial estimate of a 1.7 percent rate for April through June.
The Federal Reserve will consider the latest data at its September meeting, when it decides whether to begin pulling back on its stimulus efforts. The most critical factor the Fed will weigh is the August employment report, due out next Friday.
Another concern is that rising interest rates could dampen consumer spending, particularly on homes and cars. Mortgage rates have already risen more than a full percentage point since May.
The small rise in spending was driven by a 0.9 percent gain in purchases of nondurable goods, like clothing. Purchases of durable goods like cars fell 0.2 percent, while money spent on services like utilities and doctor's visits was unchanged in July.
A price gauge tied to consumer spending was up 0.1 percent in July compared to June. Prices excluding volatile food and energy are up just 1.4 percent compared to a year ago, significantly below the Federal Reserve's 2 percent target for inflation.

HEADLINE: A Much Less Special Relationship

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
LONDON -- Britain's decision not to stand with the United States, its closest ally, in possible military action to punish the Syrian regime for a deadly chemical weapons attack marks a watershed moment that leaves the ''special relationship'' in search of meaning and Britain in search of its role in the world.
The trans-Atlantic alliance has been a central pillar of the security of the postwar world. The core of it was the British-American bond, developed after a depleted Britain passed the baton of global leadership to Washington in 1945. Differences soon emerged, not least over Suez in 1956, but this was a relationship built on the notion that its importance overrode inevitable frictions, especially in matters of war and peace. 
When Britain opts for the sidelines with Germany, leaving an American president to look to France and Turkey for support in holding Bashar al-Assad accountable for breaking the world's taboo on chemical weapons, there is little or nothing special left. Rather than standing shoulder-to-shoulder with its ally, Britain has turned its back.
It has been a very long time since a British prime minister lost a war-and-peace vote in Parliament, as David Cameron did on Syria in a stinging personal defeat. He paid the price for the ''dodgy dossier,'' ''Bush's poodle'' and all the other damning epithets that came to accompany Tony Blair's support a decade ago of the war America fought in Iraq on false pretenses. Something broke then in the U.S.-British bond. It is now clear that Barack Obama, for all the hopes vested in him, has failed to rebuild it.
''The real reason the vote was lost was not so much doubt about strategy as the toxic nature of association with the United States, the idea of being dragged along again like a poodle in a U.S.-led military operation,'' said Jonathan Eyal of the Royal United Services Institute. ''For Britain's self-defined status in the world the vote was catastrophic. It has fatally hit the special relationship.''
As Cameron acknowledged, the vote by 285 votes to 272, with 30 defections from his own Tory party, contained an irrefutable message: ''It is clear to me that the British Parliament, reflecting the views of the British people, does not want to see British military action.''
That is right: The British, like other Europeans, are weary of war, and more mistrusting than before of the United States of Guantánamo, Abu Ghraib, post-9/11 bellicosity, mass surveillance and the banking crisis. A U.S. hangover permeated the House of Commons. So did the memory of the more than 600 British dead in Iraq and Afghanistan.
The emblematic figure of this fiasco was Ed Miliband, the opposition Labour Party leader. If his older brother David, a firm friend of America who was defeated by Ed for the party leadership, had been leading Labour at this moment, the outcome might well have been different. But Ed Miliband, 43, with no particular sentiment toward the United States, and little feeling for the 20th-century accomplishments of NATO and the trans-Atlantic alliance, is representative of his generation. (Equally, Obama has no particular sentiments toward Britain.)
After the vote, Miliband articulated his vision of a new cherry-picking relationship with Washington: ''There's a lesson for Britain, though, which is that we must lead in the right way for Britain from our national interest and indeed our global interest. Now sometimes that will mean agreeing with what America is doing and the way it's going about things and sometimes it will mean doing things in a different way.''
That leaves Britain picking cherries nowhere in particular. The United States has always represented the alternative to the European Union for an island nation unsure about European integration. Now, at the very moment when Britain is moving toward a referendum on E.U. membership and hostility to Brussels is at an all-time high, London has snubbed Washington in its hour of need.
It was a very European vote, in its anti-war sentiment, and it stands as a monument to British confusion about its identity. As George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, said, it was a moment of ''national soul searching about our role in the world.''
I do not expect any quick answers to that search. Britain is an angry state, and Europe or the United States can at different moments become the object of that ill-defined anger against the ''establishment'' or ''the powerful.'' The world is also in transition; wherever it ends up, the trans-Atlantic relationship is going to count less because power will lie elsewhere.
Britain and the United States will continue to matter a great deal to each other. But for anyone who believes as I do in the ultimate beneficence of Pax Americana, in the values of the trans-Atlantic world and in the critical importance of American credibility on the red lines it draws for global security and against the horrors of gassing, the British vote represents a bleak turning point.

HEADLINE: In Des Moines, a Bonanza That Not Everyone Wants

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
DES MOINES -- Nearly a decade ago, Lisa Connett, newly divorced and struggling on a tight budget, decided to fight City Hall over its ''franchise fee'' on residents' utility bills. Now, as a result of her class-action suit, consumers here stand to collect some $40 million in refunds on fees that courts deemed an illegal tax.
But not everyone eligible for a refund is happy. Some have even written to City Hall officials telling them to keep the money. 
''We are worried about cuts in services,'' said Lance Henning, the executive director of the Greater Des Moines Habitat for Humanity, who said his organization would prefer to forgo the more than $6,000 in repayment it has coming. ''We want a strong city.''
A City Council representative, Christine Hensley, said many Des Moines residents tell her they oppose the refunds because, as they see it, ''they're probably just going to have to turn around and pay higher taxes'' to cover the cost.
Ms. Connett, 42, is puzzled by some of the sentiment. ''They act like I've done something wrong,'' she said.
To the contrary, according to judges, it was the city that erred by creating a tax without proper authority. To address the legal issues with the franchise fee, the Iowa Legislature in 2009 granted the appropriate taxing powers.
But the fees collected by the city between 2005 and 2009 were unauthorized, the courts ruled, and must be returned to the customers of the utility, MidAmerican Energy.
So after nearly a decade of legal battling -- a case that twice reached the Iowa Supreme Court -- the Polk County District Court will soon select an administrator to determine the precise refund owed to each consumer.
Brad Schroeder, the lawyer for Ms. Connett and other plaintiffs, said the sums would vary, from hundreds of dollars for individual homeowners to many thousands for large businesses and big nonprofit organizations.
The city is considering a range of measures to make up for the money it will need to repay, said Rick Clark, the city manager. Those options include cutting services, issuing bonds, or going to the voters to ask for an increase in the utility franchise fee, now that it is a legal tax.
''For a city of our size,'' Mr. Clark said, ''$40 million is a huge number to replace.''
The notice to consumers will include an option to waive the refund, Mr. Clark said, adding that many utility customers had vowed to refuse the money out of a sense of civic purpose.
It was civic duty, Ms. Connett said, that propelled her fight. She attended almost every court proceeding, using vacation time and rearranging her work schedule to keep tabs on the suit. She said her determination to see justice for consumers never waned, even when she learned she had breast cancer in 2010. Doctors now say she is healthy.
''My hair has grown back,'' she said.
Her lawyer, Mr. Schroeder, said he was troubled that Ms. Connett, ''who will not be enriched in any way'' by this case, was sometimes ''attacked for causing trouble'' for the city.
''In a lot of ways,'' he said, ''Lisa became a target.''
Mr. Schroeder, who practices law from a storefront office in downtown Des Moines, said he handled the suit on a contingency basis, sometimes resorting to loans to cover expenses. He now stands to collect significant legal fees, a sum to be determined by the court.
The franchise fee was levied in the first place, he said, because the city was under economic duress and the local government was loath to raise property taxes. Park and library services were diminished. Police and firefighter work forces were reduced. In the last seven years, the city has cut more than 300 full-time positions.
''The franchise fee wasn't designed to make government bigger,'' Mr. Clark said. ''We were just trying to protect social services.''
Despite the cost, Des Moines is in no danger of becoming another Detroit or any of the other cities facing solvency issues. Standard & Poor's recently gave the city a AAA bond rating. Unemployment in Des Moines, a hub for financial and insurance businesses, stands below 5 percent, far better than the national numbers.
Ms. Connett said she had no regrets about her role in tangling with the city. ''They weren't being truthful or fair,'' she said. ''That bothered me.''

HEADLINE: The Mayoral Candidates on City Spending

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
New York is in better financial shape than many other cities, but it faces serious fiscal challenges. During Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's 12 years in office, annual city spending has increased to $73 billion, from roughly $44 billion; the city's health care costs have nearly doubled; and its pension costs have nearly quintupled.
The costs of pensions and health benefits for nearly 300,000 city workers and 200,000 retired city workers who are still too young to qualify for Medicare are continuing to rise fast. For every $100,000 the city pays in salary to a police officer, it pays roughly $104,000 more toward the officer's health care and future pension benefits.
Mr. Bloomberg bears some responsibility, having supported pension sweeteners approved by Albany and having handed out raises to city employees without getting concessions on pensions or health care. 
All of the city's major labor contracts have now expired, and the next mayor will face the task of renegotiating those contracts at a time when public employee union members are demanding retroactive raises.
The New York Times asked the leading candidates in contested mayoral primaries three questions about city spending. The description of their positions is drawn from their responses and previous statements.
Would the number of city employees grow or shrink under your administration?
Bill de Blasio (D), like most of the candidates, did not answer the question directly, asserting that the number of city employees was ''not a zero-sum game.'' He said that achieving his goals would ''require some agencies to expand, particularly those providing early education to our kids, and some to be restructured'' -- presumably a euphemism for cuts.
John C. Liu (D) did not answer the question directly but said he would decrease the ''city's reliance on overpriced contractors.'' He was one of the fiercest critics of CityTime, a project intended to modernize the city's payroll system that became more costly because of fraud.
Christine C. Quinn (D) did not answer the question directly but said that, while it was ''impossible to predict what the city's finances will be,'' she would try to avoid reducing the number of teachers, police officers and firefighters. On the campaign trail, she mentions her role in preventing firehouse closings and in a 2011 budget deal that averted 4,100 teacher layoffs.
William C. Thompson Jr. (D) who did not answer the question directly, said he would focus on educating city employees in technology in order to reduce the cost of consultants.
Anthony D. Weiner (D) said he would reduce waste in agencies, but did not rule out hiring more people. He suggested that he would turn desk jobs currently being performed by police officers over to civilians.
John A. Catsimatidis (R) did not answer the question directly, but implied that the number of employees would either stay the same or shrink and said he would put into effect ''a voluntary attrition program.'' He also said that ''on Day 1'' he would ''freeze all taxes the mayor controls.''
Joseph J. Lhota (R) said ''Shrink,'' adding that he would reduce the head count through attrition. He said the growth in the city's budget over the tenure of the Bloomberg administration had been harmful to the economy.
How would you tackle the rising cost of health insurance premiums for city workers?
Mr. de Blasio said that he would create up to 20 health clinics at city employees' work sites that would offer them and their families routine checkups, basic lab tests, prescriptions, vaccines, and chronic disease management. A 2011 paper by the Government Finance Officers Association cited research showing that such clinics can could save employers $1.60 to $4 for every dollar invested.
Mr. Liu said that he would reduce premiums by offering so-called wellness incentives, in which employees would commit to measures like regular health screenings or smoking-cessation counseling. Such programs can reduce costs when tied to a reduction in employee health care contributions, but most city employees do not pay anything toward premiums, so it is unclear what would motivate them to join these programs.
Ms. Quinn said she would work with city workers to explore a number of options, including rebidding the city's health insurance businessproviders, eliminating co-payments for medication for chronic diseases like asthma and diabetes to reduce emergency room visits, and creating free clinics like those that the hotel workers' union offers its members.
Mr. Thompson declined to provide any specific ideas, using the oft-cited explanation that he would not ''negotiate contracts in public.''
Mr. Weiner has said that a Medicare-like system he has proposed to cover city employees and retirees would curb costs by reducing the role of insurance companies. He has said he would also ask city workers and retirees to contribute 10 percent of their premiums, and smokers 25 percent. That proposal would probably encounter resistance from unions, which would probably demand raises to offset new costs.
Mr. Catsimatidis said that the rising cost of health benefits and pensions was ''unsustainable'' but that he would not negotiate publicly. ''We can't continue to pay someone for another 50 years after they have worked for 20 years and retired,'' he said.
Mr. Lhota suggested that he would ask city employees to contribute toward their premiums, saying that city workers ''need to pay a fair amount of their health insurance, just like everyone else.'' He will have to convince persuade unions, which would most likely ask for raises to compensate for any extra costs to workers.
What would you do to reduce overtime in the Police and Fire Departments, without reducing public safety?
Mr. de Blasio said he would ''draw a line in the sand'' over further personnel reductions in the two agencies. He said he would shift officers from desk jobs to patrol responsibilities. But there is a limit to how many officers can be moved from desk jobs to the streets: Some officers are on administrative leave for disciplinary or mental health reasons.
Mr. Liu said he would increase the number of police officers and firefighters so that the departments relied less on overtime. But hiring new officers and firefighters would also cost money, and he did not explain where it would come from.
Ms. Quinn proposes hiring 1,600 new police officers, turning office jobs in the department over to civilians and reducing the time between arrest and arraignment. But not all police desk jobs can be turned over to civilians, and the Bloomberg administration has already made some headway in reducing the time between arrest and arraignment.
Mr. Thompson said his police and fire commissioners would ''look for ways to trim costs,'' but he was not specific about what those might be. He has said he would hire 2,000 new police officers.
Mr. Weiner said he would use civilians and retired police officers, rather than active-duty police officers, to put up barriers at parades and street fairs. Parades and fairs are a significant source of police overtime, since the city does not want to reduce the number of police officers in other parts of the city during a parade.
Mr. Catsimatidis declined to answer the question, saying he had ''learned from experience as a businessman that you can't be on the outside looking in and make these type of decisions.'' He added, ''On Day 1, I will open the books and get the true financial picture of the city with my team of professionals.''
Mr. Lhota said he would try to reduce arrest-to-arraignment time -- a significant cause of police overtime, because the arresting officer is often required to talk to the district attorney's office either in person or by phone before the arraignment. Mr. Lhota said that he would work with the district attorneys to expedite the process using technology.

HEADLINE: Making the Safety Net More Visible

BYLINE: By JON HURDLE

 BODY:
PHILADELPHIA -- Like many poor people in this city, Gladys James did not know she was entitled to free home help or discounted water bills. She had no idea she was eligible to re-enroll for food stamps after being cut off last year because of a misunderstanding.
Ms. James, 92, a former factory seamstress, lives on Social Security and a small pension totaling about $688 a month, or $8,266 annually. That puts her income well below the official federal poverty line of $11,490 a year for a single person. 
She is one of 430,000 people in Philadelphia -- 28 percent of the city's population -- who live below the poverty line, the highest rate among the 10 largest American cities. Some 200,000 live on income that is less than half the federal poverty threshold, placing them in the ''deep poverty'' category, according to city statistics.
In North Philadelphia, one of the poorest sections of the city, as many as 65 percent of individuals in some neighborhoods meet the guidelines for the Community Services Block Grant, a federal program that funds local agencies providing services to low-income communities, according to 2010 census data.
But with an array of public and private agencies providing different services in different locations, many poor people here are not getting the assistance available to them that could help them find work or qualify for benefits.
In response, Philadelphia initiated an effort this summer that offers ''one-stop shopping'' in local outreach centers to help people get all the assistance they need -- with food, housing, job training, financial counseling, child care and other services -- in one place.
The effort, called Shared Prosperity, is a response to the recent growth in the number of poor people, many of whom are not benefiting from the city's current economic recovery, said Eva Gladstein, executive director of the Mayor's Office of Community Empowerment and Opportunity, which runs the program.
''We've been bringing our economy back, but we haven't paid attention to people with the fewest skills,'' Ms. Gladstein said.
One-fifth of eligible residents are not receiving food stamps under the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, and about the same number are not getting cash payments available to the working poor under the earned-income tax credit, city officials say.
After the intervention of Community Legal Services, a nonprofit group that advocates for low-income people, Ms. James eventually qualified for a city program under which she pays only $25 a month toward her water bills, and will shortly be receiving free visits from workers who will help her with chores in her North Philadelphia row home.
After getting help from a social worker, she has also recently requalified for food stamps, worth about $85 a month, after being cut off in November because she did not know she had to enter a new identification number to receive the benefit.
''She was the one that told me I should be getting food stamps,'' Ms. James said of the worker, sitting in the cluttered, dimly lighted living room of the house where she has lived since 1955.
Clients of the new program include Cola Dockery, 34, who was released from prison in February after serving six months for burglary and armed robbery, and has since been living in a Philadelphia homeless shelter. Through the program, he got Internet access that allowed him to apply for jobs, qualified for food stamps and received mentoring by city staff members.
He also learned for the first time about how to set up a bank account, how to qualify for assistance from a food bank, and how to obtain free bus tokens so he could travel to job interviews.
Recently he landed a job as a kitchen worker at a local college, for which he is paid about $250 a week. It is not enough to allow him to move into his own place anytime soon, he said, but he is grateful for the work, and credits the city's poverty services for helping him get it.
To increase job opportunities for the poor, who often lack education or work experience, the new program aims to use tax credits to attract businesses in fields like hotel and restaurant work, health care and transportation that provide entry-level jobs and opportunities for career advancement. Officials hope to create 25,000 more jobs, including 1,700 in hotels and restaurants, by 2015.
In an attempt to break a cycle in which successive generations live in poverty, the program also hopes to increase the number of children entering kindergarten with pre-literacy skills, and to increase enrollment in high-quality child care. And to reduce the impact on the poor of predatory lending and costly check-cashing services, it will offer financial counseling to help clients open bank accounts, raise credit scores and reduce debt.
The services will also help former inmates, who face some of the biggest challenges in finding work.
Phillip Fundenberg, 49, said he had benefited from the city's services after being released from prison in January, and urged officials to do more to publicize the new program.
''The city really doesn't let the public know about all the stuff that's out there,'' Mr. Fundenberg said.

HEADLINE: Rupee Drops, And Outlook Grows Darker For India

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER; Neha Thirani Bagri contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MUMBAI, India -- The statistical evidence is piling up that India's economy may be in even worse shape than had been thought.
India's economy slowed in early summer to its weakest pace since the bottom of the global economic downturn in 2009, government statistics released Friday evening showed.
The Central Statistics Office in New Delhi said that the economy grew 4.4 percent in the quarter ended June 30, well below economists' expectations of 4.8 percent. The quarter was the weakest since output grew 3.5 percent in the quarter that ended March 31, 2009. 
The accumulating signs of economic distress -- slower growth, a widening current-account deficit, higher oil prices and rising inflation in general -- suggest that the monthlong fall of the Indian rupee in currency markets may be a symptom of fundamental troubles in the Indian economy and not just part of the broader difficulties experienced by Asian emerging market currencies in recent weeks.
Hints that the Federal Reserve in the United States may soon shift to a tighter monetary policy have prompted global investors to shift billions of dollars out of financial markets from São Paulo to Jakarta to Mumbai, eroding the value of local currencies in developing economies. But the Indian rupee has fallen the fastest of any emerging market currency in the last month, down 8.1 percent. Broader investor disenchantment with emerging markets has been compounded here by worries about India's economy, the third-largest in Asia after China's and Japan's.
Manufacturing and mining have been hit the hardest. A court-ordered halt to most iron ore mining across India for environmental reasons has hurt steel and other sectors; state governments have been raising taxes on the sector, and broader demand has begun to falter.
''The fact is, yes, the manufacturing sector has slowed down,'' said Raj K. Singh, the chairman and managing director of the Bharat Petroleum Corporation, an oil refining and marketing company that is two-thirds owned by the Indian government and is one of the country's largest businesses.
The data was released after stock market and currency trading had ended for the day, despite government promises to stay with the regular Friday morning release. After a week of considerable volatility, the rupee and the Mumbai stock market both had showed modest gains earlier Friday.
India enjoyed annual growth of 8 to 9 percent in the years leading up to the global financial crisis but has struggled to reach 6 percent since then, despite heavy government spending and large fiscal and trade deficits.
From corner stores to corporate boardrooms, the consensus in Mumbai these days is that stagnation may continue over the next few months, although almost no one expects a steep downturn.
Sitting in his office on Friday morning in front of an abstract Indian painting in blues and yellows, Mr. Singh voiced concern about a 7.2 percent drop in nationwide diesel consumption during the first three weeks of August from a year ago. Nationwide diesel consumption was also down 5.9 percent in July from a year ago.
But heavy monsoon rains have limited the need for diesel in irrigation pumps, making the comparison less clear, Mr. Singh cautioned. Rohit Dawar, the top diesel demand expert at the Petroleum Ministry in New Delhi, said in a telephone interview that diesel consumption had been artificially inflated in July and August last year by a peculiarity in government fuel subsidies, since removed, that temporarily made it cheaper to burn diesel instead of other fuels in industrial boilers.
Even allowing for all of these factors, however, ''there is a slight slowdown'' in diesel demand recently, Mr. Dawar said.
Plentiful monsoon rains, a key indicator for the Indian economy for thousands of years, have produced lush fields that could yet help stabilize broader measures of the economy in the coming months and forestall a steeper slowdown. While World Bank data show that value added in agriculture is only one-sixth of the economy these days, a good harvest could still play an outsize role in limiting recent increases in food prices.
Inflation will probably remain a problem, however, given that India relies almost entirely on imported oil, which becomes more expensive with each drop of the rupee. So important is oil to India's trade deficit that desperate bidding for scarce dollars by Indian refiners helped drive the rupee briefly to a record low on Wednesday, before the Reserve Bank of India stopped the rout that evening by arranging to transfer dollars from its reserves to oil importers.
''Prices are rising for everything -- petrol is more expensive, vegetables are more expensive,'' said Bharat Hirji Gada, a local shopkeeper.
India has some advantages compared with European and other Asian countries that have experienced steep economic downturns following currency declines over the last two decades. The biggest advantage may be that the Indian government has long prohibited borrowing in foreign currencies by poor or middle-class households and by small and medium-size businesses.
Foreign debt has been concentrated among blue-chip companies and wealthy individuals. Many of these loans are to borrowers whose revenue is largely denominated in dollars, limiting their currency exposure, said Haseeb A. Drabu, the chief economist for the Essar Group, one of India's heavy industry giants.
''The bulk of it would be hedged,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Why India's Economy Is Stumbling

BYLINE: By ARVIND SUBRAMANIAN. 
Arvind Subramanian, a senior fellow at both the Peterson Institute for International Economics and the Center for Global Development, is the author of ''Eclipse: Living in the Shadow of China's Economic Dominance.''

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- FOR the past three decades, the Indian economy has grown impressively, at an average annual rate of 6.4 percent. From 2002 to 2011, when the average rate was 7.7 percent, India seemed to be closing in on China -- unstoppable, and engaged in a second ''tryst with destiny,'' to borrow Jawaharlal Nehru's phrase. The economic potential of its vast population, expected to be the world's largest by the middle of the next decade, appeared to be unleashed as India jettisoned the stifling central planning and economic controls bequeathed it by Mr. Nehru and the nation's other socialist founders.
But India's self-confidence has been shaken. Growth has slowed to 4.4 percent a year; the rupee is in free fall, resulting in higher prices for imported goods; and the specter of a potential crisis, brought on by rising inflation and crippling budget deficits, looms. 
To some extent, India has been just another victim of the ebb and flow of global finance, which it embraced too enthusiastically. The threat (or promise) of tighter monetary policies at the Federal Reserve and a resurgent American economy threaten to suck capital, and economic dynamism, out of many emerging-market economies.
But India's problems have deep and stubborn origins of the country's own making.
The current government, which took office in 2004, has made two fundamental errors. First, it assumed that growth was on autopilot and failed to address serious structural problems. Second, flush with revenues, it began major redistribution programs, neglecting their consequences: higher fiscal and trade deficits.
Structural problems were inherent in India's unusual model of economic development, which relied on a limited pool of skilled labor rather than an abundant supply of cheap, unskilled, semiliterate labor. This meant that India specialized in call centers, writing software for European companies and providing back-office services for American health insurers and law firms and the like, rather than in a manufacturing model. Other economies that have developed successfully -- Taiwan, Singapore, South Korea and China -- relied in their early years on manufacturing, which provided more jobs for the poor.
Two decades of double-digit growth in pay for skilled labor have caused wages to rise and have chipped away at India's competitive advantage. Countries like the Philippines have emerged as attractive alternatives for outsourcing. India's higher-education system is not generating enough talent to meet the demand for higher skills. Worst of all, India is failing to make full use of the estimated one million low-skilled workers who enter the job market every month.
Manufacturing requires transparent rules and reliable infrastructure. India is deficient in both. High-profile scandals over the allocation of mobile broadband spectrum, coal and land have undermined confidence in the government. If land cannot be easily acquired and coal supplies easily guaranteed, the private sector will shy away from investing in the power grid. Irregular electricity holds back investments in factories.
India's panoply of regulations, including inflexible labor laws, discourages companies from expanding. As they grow, large Indian businesses prefer to substitute machines for unskilled labor. During China's three-decade boom (1978-2010), manufacturing accounted for about 34 percent of China's economy. In India, this number peaked at 17 percent in 1995 and is now around 14 percent.
In fairness, poverty has sharply declined over the last three decades, to about 20 percent from around 50 percent. But since the greatest beneficiaries were the highly skilled and talented, the Indian public has demanded that growth be more inclusive. Democratic and competitive politics have compelled politicians to address this challenge, and revenues from buoyant growth provided the means to do so.
Thus, India provided guarantees of rural employment and kept up subsidies to the poor for food, power, fuel and fertilizer. The subsidies consume as much as 2.7 percent of gross domestic product, but corruption and inefficient administration have meant that the most needy often don't reap the benefits.
Meanwhile, rural subsidies have pushed up wages, contributing to double-digit inflation. India's fiscal deficit amounts to about 9 percent of gross domestic product (compared with structural deficits of around 2.5 percent in the United States and 1.9 percent in the European Union). To hedge against inflation and general uncertainty, consumers have furiously acquired gold, rendering the country reliant on foreign capital to finance its trade deficit.
Economic stability can be restored through major reforms to cut inefficient spending and raise taxes, thereby pruning the deficit and taming inflation. The economist Raghuram G. Rajan, who just left the University of Chicago to run India's central bank, has his work cut out for him. So do Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, also an economist, and the governing party, the Indian National Congress. These steps need not come at the expense of the poor. For example, India is implementing an ambitious biometric identification scheme that will allow targeted cash transfers to replace inefficient welfare programs.
India can still become a manufacturing powerhouse, if it makes major upgrades to its roads, ports and power systems and reforms its labor laws and business regulations. But the country is in pre-election mode until early next year. Elections increase pressures to spend and delay reform. So India's weakness and turbulence may persist for some time yet.

HEADLINE: Orchestra Calls In Big Gun In Dispute

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
He brokered peace in Northern Ireland and spent two frustrating years as an envoy in the Middle East. Now George J. Mitchell, the former senator from Maine, is trying to bring peace to the Midwest, as the mediator in the Minnesota Orchestra's bitter labor dispute.
The acrimony there will test his diplomacy skills as the orchestra hurtles toward a Sept. 15 deadline that is likely to determine its fate, and whether it is able to retain its acclaimed music director, Osmo Vanska. 
The orchestra's musicians have been locked out by management since they rejected deep pay cuts last October. The festering dispute silenced the ensemble's entire 2012-13 season, forced the cancellation of a September recording session for its Grammy-nominated Sibelius cycle, and could force it to cancel a pair of crucial Carnegie Hall concerts in November.
Mr. Vanska has threatened to resign if the Carnegie concerts are canceled. To ensure that the musicians are ready for Carnegie, the orchestra and Mr. Vanska said this week, the players would have to be back at work for the proverbial practice, practice, practice by Sept. 30. For that to happen, the orchestra said, the sides would need to reach an agreement by Sept. 15.
The lingering dispute has pained music lovers and dealt a blow to the psyche of Minneapolitans, silencing their beloved local orchestra just as it was gaining in stature nationally, and calling into question the idea of ''Minnesota nice'' with its hardball tactics.
''This has been a real catastrophe,'' Mayor R. T. Rybak of Minneapolis said in an interview, explaining that it has deeply upset people in a region that takes the arts seriously, and hurt business at local restaurants and hotels. ''It's shaken the confidence of the civic community in an institution that has survived depressions, wars and everything else.''
Mr. Mitchell was called in to mediate this summer after key political figures, including Gov. Mark Dayton of Minnesota, urged both sides to find a resolution.
A proposal Mr. Mitchell put forward to bring the players back to work -- for two months at their old salaries, and for two more months at a 6 percent cut -- was accepted by musicians but rejected by management, which said it would widen the deficit without guaranteeing a full season. (Mr. Mitchell declined a request for comment.)
The standoff began last year, when the orchestra, whose endowment suffered in the recession and which has been running deficits, proposed a contract cutting the base pay of the musicians by nearly a third, to $78,000 a year from $113,000. (The average pay would have been higher.) When the players rejected that, after about six months of talks, but did not offer a counterproposal, management locked them out when the contract expired on Oct. 1.
Since then, the state of the negotiations might best be described as minimalism interrupted by loud bursts of dissonance.
Management insists that costs must be curbed substantially to make the orchestra sustainable, while musicians warn that deep cuts could change its very nature.
Michael Henson, the president and chief executive of the orchestra, said in an interview that he was ''puzzled and amazed'' that a resolution had proved elusive, and that the institution could not afford to keep running deficits and sap its endowment.
''There's no point having a wonderful orchestra that buries its head in the sand and has to declare bankruptcy in three years' time,'' he said. ''Part of what we're trying to do is be responsible stewards for the long-term benefit of the musicians, to ensure that they have continuity of employment.''
But musicians warn that this attempt to fix the orchestra's finances could effectively destroy it if the ensemble loses another season, recording deals, longtime musicians and, very possibly, its music director.
Timothy Zavadil, a clarinetist who is the chairman of the musicians' negotiating committee, said that the orchestra had become a draw for talented musicians.
''Our concern now is that, with the proposals that our board and management are putting forth -- the drastic reductions in pay, the work rules changes -- we will lose our status as a destination orchestra,'' he said. ''The conditions that led us to develop our signature sound will be lost if this turns into an orchestra where people want to spend a few years while they're practicing to move on to another one.''
As the musicians saw their paychecks stopped, some collected unemployment, some played local concerts, and others retired or took leaves to play with other orchestras. More than 20 have left the ensemble over the last two years; some have taken temporary jobs that will allow them to return, but others may have left for good. The musicians posted a photograph of the orchestra, with the members who left whited out, on a Web page that calls them the ''ghosts'' of the lockout.
Mr. Henson, the orchestra president, said that any musicians who do not return can be replaced. ''When we get up and running again,'' he said, ''as other orchestras in this position have, we will advertise for the jobs that we need to replace, and I'm sure we will get an astonishing bunch of individuals who will want to perform and live in this great city.''
Adding to the discord is a $52 million renovation of Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis that has just been completed. Though the construction was done with funds raised for that purpose, it has left some questioning the expense as management tries to cut pay. Mr. Zavadil said that ''the juxtaposition of being locked out while they are doing a $52 million building renovation is what has really, I think, incensed our fans.''
There was some movement this week when management offered to give the players two months at their old salaries, and then two years with a cut in base pay of nearly a quarter. The musicians said the offer resembled one they recently rejected. But the offer, made outside of Mr. Mitchell's mediation process, may spur new talks.
Mayor Rybak recalled a concert he helped arrange in February to celebrate the orchestra's Grammy nomination for its recording of Sibelius's Second and Fifth Symphonies.
''The beauty of it was there were musicians, board members, community members, focused on what we need to do more of: the art,'' he said. ''I just hope that everybody who's negotiating hears that Sibelius recording in the background, and says that that great sound shouldn't be shut off because grown-ups can't solve a problem.''

HEADLINE: Fertility Treatments Produce Heirs Their Parents Never Knew

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
THE number of children conceived through in vitro fertilization has doubled over the last decade. The technology that has made these children possible has also challenged inheritance laws, especially in circumstances when a child is conceived after the death of a parent.
While this may sound bizarre, posthumously conceived children can become a quandary for the rich and the not-so-rich alike. The problem is always about money. The rich worry about who will get their assets after they are dead, while people of more meager means have turned to the courts in the hope of collecting federal benefits.
''We're going to see a flurry of activity on this, because new technologies are ballooning,'' said Sharon L. Klein, managing director at Wilmington Trust and chairwoman of the trusts, estates and surrogate's courts committee of the New York City Bar Association.
''You read about women in their late 20s and early 30s who are saving their eggs and want to focus on their careers and haven't met the right partner yet,'' she said. The woman's eggs could be used to produce a child even if the woman never wanted the eggs used after her death. 
The law is clear on one thing: when a trust document does not address the issue, Ms. Klein said, ''children born with the new technology are entitled to inherit with the same rights as a natural-born child.''
Consider the example of a sick person who, before undergoing chemotherapy that will cause sterility, donates sperm or eggs to be frozen, in hopes of having children later. The patient intends to have the children after recovery. But should the patient die without something in writing stating this intent, the surviving partner could have a claim on that genetic material and could use it to produce a child.
Other possibilities exist. A couple who has embryos left over after having children through in vitro fertilization could, instead of destroying them, donate them to a woman, essentially giving her a child they created. That could have unintended consequences. ''It's not inconceivable now that if the father and mother of that embryo were to strike it rich, the child born of that other woman could say, 'Those are my genetic parents,' '' said John M. Olivieri, a partner at White & Case. And if the child says that, chances are he or she would ask for a share of the genetic parents' wealth.
''Posthumous reproduction is the perfect storm of competing interests,'' said Susan M. Wolf, professor of law, medicine and public policy at the University of Minnesota School of Law. ''There's the surviving partner who wants to reproduce, the interests of the deceased while they were alive or as they memorialized them, the pre-existing kids who don't want their interest diluted and finally the kids who are brought into the picture but who may be financially most at risk.''
Several lawsuits have already tested this issue, and many more have been settled privately, lawyers said.
In 2007, the New York County Surrogate's Court decided in the case In re Martin B. that two posthumously conceived children could benefit from a trust created by their grandfather, Martin B., for his two sons and any grandchildren. (Real names were not used in the suit to protect the children.)
The case was brought jointly by Martin B.'s wife and the widow of their son, whose frozen sperm had been used to conceive two children three and five years after his death. They wanted to know whether the posthumously conceived children were descendants for the purpose of the trust.
The answer decided whether tens, if not hundreds, of millions of dollars from the estate of Martin B. went to those children or if all of it was divided among the surviving son and his children.
What made this case even more intriguing was that Martin B.'s wife had the ability to divide the assets in the trusts her husband set up as she saw fit. Lawyers on both sides said even if her posthumously conceived grandchildren were not considered, she could have cut her living son out of his inheritance.
''Biologically, were they the grantor's grandkids? Yes,'' said Jonathan Blattmachr, the lawyer who represented Martin B.'s wife. ''But legally, were they his grandkids? Most people would say yes.''
Mr. Olivieri, who represented the surviving son, had a different interpretation, hinging on the motivation of the widow for conceiving two children after her husband's death. ''My take is here is a woman who married into a wealthy family,'' he said. ''The only way she could stay on the gravy train was by having his children.''
He added: ''She wasn't hated. She was going to be O.K. But she got herself a better situation.'' While she did not directly benefit from the settlement, her children were ultimately deemed to be descendants and therefore entitled to distributions from the trust.
At the other end of the economic spectrum is the case of Astrue v. Capato. It was brought by Karen K. Capato against the Social Security Administration to claim benefits for twins conceived after her husband died.
Last year, the United States Supreme Court reversed a lower-court ruling and said that state law should determine such claims. Since at the time of his death the father lived in Florida, which does not recognize posthumously conceived children not mentioned in a will, she could not receive Social Security benefits for them. Right now about a third of the states have laws recognizing the rights of posthumously conceived children; of that group, Ohio is the only other one that does not allow them to received federal benefits.
So how should people wade through this murky area of the law and ensure that children who are genetically linked to them are treated fairly?
In the example of the couple with leftover embryos from their own I.V.F., Mr. Olivieri said he would encourage them to write into their estate documents that frozen embryos exist but that children born to someone else using those embryos are not considered descendants.
When it comes to setting up a trust for children conceived after death, the conversation shifts. Joshua S. Rubenstein, managing partner at Katten Muchin Rosenman in New York, who represented the surviving brother's children in In re Martin B., said he had pressed clients to consider this issue for more than a decade.
''To anyone who thinks about it, 99 times out of 100 they don't want to include children born after they're dead,'' he said. ''They've lived with their own kids and they want them to get their things and not some kid who was born years later that they never knew.''
Mr. Rubenstein said that he had represented both sides of this issue and that he counseled people planning to conceive a dead spouse's child posthumously to understand that having the right to use genetic material for a child is not the same as having the right to inherit as if that spouse were still alive.
If a trust prohibits children born to unwed parents from inheriting money, there could be problems. Mr. Rubenstein pointed out that any child conceived posthumously automatically falls into this category, because the parents are no longer married when one of them is dead.
If they don't exclude those children, Ms. Klein said clients generally set a time limit for them to be conceived. Otherwise a frozen embryo could be used decades later and be considered a descendant, eligible for a share of an estate that has already been settled.
Of the states that have passed laws clearing up the inheritance rights of posthumously conceived children, eight have set time limits of one to three years.
In New York, legislation setting guidelines for posthumously conceived children passed the Assembly but was not taken up by the Senate. For the child to inherit, the proposed legislation requires written consent from a person that genetic material can be used posthumously and sets a time limit on when the child must be conceived and born.
Ms. Klein said setting a time limit was important in all cases and should be written into estate plans. ''The fundamental issue is balancing competing interests,'' she said. ''There is the need for certainty and finality versus the interests of these children born as a result of scientific advancement.''

HEADLINE: Seamus Heaney, 1939-2013; He Wove Irish Strife and Soil Into Silken Verse

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX; James C. McKinley Jr. contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Seamus Heaney, the 1995 Nobel laureate in literature, who was often called the greatest Irish poet since Yeats, died on Friday in Dublin. He was 74.
His publisher, Faber & Faber, announced the death. The Irish poet Paul Muldoon, a longtime friend, said that Mr. Heaney was hospitalized after a fall on Thursday. Mr. Heaney had suffered a stroke in 2006.
In an address, President Michael D. Higgins of Ireland, himself a poet, praised Mr. Heaney's ''contribution to the republics of letters, conscience and humanity.'' Enda Kenny, the Irish prime minister, said that Mr. Heaney's death had brought ''great sorrow to Ireland, to language and to literature.''
A Roman Catholic native of Northern Ireland, Mr. Heaney was renowned for work that powerfully evoked the beauty and blood that together have come to define the modern Irish condition. The author of more than a dozen collections of poetry, as well as critical essays and works for the stage, he repeatedly explored the strife and uncertainties that have afflicted his homeland, while managing simultaneously to steer clear of polemic. 
Mr. Heaney (pronounced HEE-nee), who had made his home in Dublin since the 1970s, was known to a wide public for the profuse white hair and stentorian voice that befit his calling. He held lectureships at some of the world's foremost universities, including Harvard, where, starting in the 1980s, he taught regularly for many years; Oxford; and the University of California, Berkeley.
As the trade magazine Publishers Weekly observed in 1995, Mr. Heaney ''has an aura, if not a star power, shared by few contemporary poets, emanating as much from his leonine features and unpompous sense of civic responsibility as from the immediate accessibility of his lines.''
Throughout his work, Mr. Heaney was consumed with morality. In his hands, a peat bog is not merely an emblematic feature of the Irish landscape; it is also a spiritual quagmire, evoking the deep ethical conundrums that have long pervaded the place.
''Yeats, despite being quite well known, despite his public role, actually didn't have anything like the celebrity or, frankly, the ability to touch the people in the way that Seamus did,'' Mr. Muldoon, a winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the poetry editor at The New Yorker, said in an interview on Friday. ''It was almost like he was indistinguishable from the country. He was like a rock star who also happened to be a poet.''
Mr. Heaney was enraptured, as he once put it, by ''words as bearers of history and mystery.'' His poetry, which had an epiphanic quality, was suffused with references to pre-Christian myth -- Celtic, of course, but also that of ancient Greece. His style, linguistically dazzling, was nonetheless lacking in the obscurity that can attend poetic pyrotechnics.
At its best, Mr. Heaney's work had both a meditative lyricism and an airy velocity. His lines could embody a dark, marshy melancholy, but as often as not they also communicated the wild onrushing joy of being alive.
The result -- work that was finely wrought yet notably straightforward -- made Mr. Heaney one of the most widely read poets in the world.
Reviewing Mr. Heaney's collection ''North'' in The New York Review of Books in 1976, the Irish poet Richard Murphy wrote: ''His original power, which even the sternest critics bow to with respect, is that he can give you the feeling as you read his poems that you are actually doing what they describe. His words not only mean what they say, they sound like their meaning.''
Mr. Heaney made his reputation with his debut volume, ''Death of a Naturalist,'' published in 1966. In ''Digging,'' a poem from the collection, he explored the earthy roots of his art:
Between my finger and my thumb
The squat pen rests; snug as a gun.
Under my window, a clean rasping sound
When the spade sinks into gravelly ground:
My father, digging. I look down
Till his straining rump among the flowerbeds
Bends low, comes up twenty years away
Stooping in rhythm through potato drills
Where he was digging.
The coarse boot nestled on the lug, the shaft
Against the inside knee was levered firmly.
He rooted out tall tops, buried the bright edge deep
To scatter new potatoes that we picked,
Loving their cool hardness in our hands.
By God, the old man could handle a spade.
Just like his old man.
My grandfather cut more turf in a day
Than any other man on Toner's bog.
Once I carried him milk in a bottle
Corked sloppily with paper. He straightened up
To drink it, then fell to right away
Nicking and slicing neatly, heaving sods
Over his shoulder, going down and down
For the good turf. Digging.
The cold smell of potato mould, the squelch and slap
Of soggy peat, the curt cuts of an edge
Through living roots awaken in my head.
But I've no spade to follow men like them.
Between my finger and my thumb
The squat pen rests.
I'll dig with it.
Though Mr. Heaney's poems often have pastoral settings, dewy rural romanticism is notably absent: instead, he depicts country life in all its harsh daily reality. His poem ''A Drink of Water'' opens this way:
She came every morning to draw water
Like an old bat staggering up the field:
The pump's whooping cough, the bucket's clatter
And slow diminuendo as it filled,
Announced her. I recall
Her grey apron, the pocked white enamel
Of the brimming bucket, and the treble
Creak of her voice like the pump's handle.
Mr. Heaney was deeply self-identified as Irish, and much of his work overtly concerned the Troubles, as the long, violent sectarian conflict in late-20th-century Northern Ireland is known.
But though he condemned British dominion in his homeland (he wrote: ''Be advised, my passport's green/No glass of ours was ever raised/To toast the Queen''), Mr. Heaney refused to disown British tradition -- and especially British literature -- altogether.
The writers who influenced him deeply, he said, included not only the Irishmen William Butler Yeats and James Joyce but also the Englishman Thomas Hardy.
In his poem ''Whatever You Say, Say Nothing,'' whose title became a byword in Northern Ireland for the linguistic subterfuge that underpins biographical conversations, Mr. Heaney wrote:
Smoke-signals are loud-mouthed compared with us:
Manoeuvrings to find out name and school,
Subtle discrimination by addresses
With hardly an exception to the rule
That Norman, Ken and Sidney signalled Prod
And Seamus (call me Sean) was sure-fire Pape.
O land of password, handgrip, wink and nod,
Of open minds as open as a trap,
Where tongues lie coiled, as under flames lie wicks,
Where half of us, as in a wooden horse
Were cabin'd and confined like wily Greeks,
Besieged within the siege, whispering morse.
As a result of Mr. Heaney's inclusive stance, some supporters of the Irish Republican cause condemned him as accommodationist. His rejoinder can be found, for instance, in lines from his 1974 essay on the Russian poet Osip Mandelstam, who was exiled to Siberia by Stalin's regime and died there in 1938.
In the essay, Mr. Heaney set forth an observation that could be applied with equal force to contemporary Ireland:
''We live here in critical times ourselves, when the idea of poetry as an art is in danger of being overshadowed by a quest for poetry as a diagram of political attitudes,'' he wrote. ''Some commentators have all the fussy literalism of an official from the ministry of truth.''
The eldest of nine children of a cattle dealer, Seamus Justin Heaney was born on April 13, 1939, at Mossbawn, his family's farm in County Derry, west of Belfast. The farm's name would appear throughout his work. Mr. Heaney's intoxication with language, he said in a 1974 lecture, ''Feeling into Words,'' ''began very early when my mother used to recite lists of affixes and suffixes, and Latin roots, with their English meanings, rhymes that formed part of her schooling in the early part of the century.''
Later in the lecture, he ventured an alternative scenario: ''Maybe it was stirred by the beautiful sprung rhythms of the old BBC weather forecast: Dogger, Rockall, Malin, Shetland, Faroes, Finisterre; or with the gorgeous and inane phraseology of the catechism; or with the litany of the Blessed Virgin that was part of the enforced poetry in our household: Tower of Gold, Ark of the Covenant, Gate of Heaven, Morning Star, Health of the Sick, Refuge of Sinners, Comforter of the Afflicted.''
In 1961, Mr. Heaney earned a bachelor's degree with first class honors in English language and literature from Queen's University of Belfast. He wrote poetry as a student, publishing under the modest pseudonym Incertus, the Latin word for ''doubtful.''
He went on to earn a teaching certificate in English from St. Joseph's College in Belfast and was later appointed to the faculty there. He began writing poetry seriously in the mid-1960s, joining a workshop led by the noted Northern Irish poet Derek Mahon.
Mr. Heaney followed ''Death of a Naturalist'' with collections including ''Door Into the Dark'' (1969), ''Wintering Out'' (1972), ''Station Island'' (1984) and ''The Midnight Verdict,'' published in 1993.
In 1995, he became the fourth Irishman to win the Nobel in literature, following Yeats, who received it in 1923; George Bernard Shaw (1925); and Samuel Beckett (1969).
In awarding the prize to Mr. Heaney, the Swedish Academy cited his ''works of lyrical beauty and ethical depth, which exalt everyday miracles and the living past'' and also commended his cleareyed analysis of the Northern Ireland conflict.
Though Mr. Heaney was lauded throughout his career, a few critics condemned his work as facile.
''If Heaney really is the best we can do, then the whole troubled, exploratory thrust of modern poetry has been a diversion from the right true way,'' the poet and critic Al Alvarez (also known as A. Alvarez) said in The New York Review of Books in 1980, reviewing Mr. Heaney's collection ''Field Work.'' Mr. Alvarez continued:
''Eliot and his contemporaries, Lowell and his, Plath and hers had it all wrong: to try to make clearings of sense and discipline and style in the untamed, unfenced darkness was to mistake morbidity for inspiration.''
Among Mr. Heaney's other volumes of poetry are ''The Spirit Level'' (1996); ''Opened Ground: Selected Poems, 1966-1996'' (1998); ''Electric Light'' (2001); ''District and Circle'' (2006); and his last, ''Human Chain,'' published in 2010.
Mr. Heaney's survivors include his wife, the former Marie Devlin, whom he married in 1965; two sons, Christopher and Michael; and a daughter, Catherine, The Associated Press reported.
His other writings include critical essays on Yeats, Joyce, Joseph Brodsky, Ted Hughes, Stevie Smith and Italo Calvino; ''Finders Keepers: Selected Prose, 1971-2001'' (2002); and a verse translation of ''Beowulf'' published in 2000.
In ''The Cure at Troy,'' his 1991 verse adaptation of Sophocles' play ''Philoctetes,'' about the Trojan War, Mr. Heaney wrote these evocative lines:
History says, Don't hope
On this side of the grave.
But then, once in a lifetime
The longed-for tidal wave
Of justice can rise up,
And hope and history rhyme.
In April, Vice President Joseph R. Biden, citing Mr. Heaney as ''one of my favorite poets,'' quoted those lines at the memorial service for Sean Collier, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer killed in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings.
Mr. Heaney was the subject of a spate of critics' studies and the biographical volume ''Seamus Heaney: The Making of the Poet'' (1993), by Michael Parker.
In a 1991 interview with the British newsmagazine The Economist, Mr. Heaney described his essential professional mandate.
''The poet is on the side of undeceiving the world,'' he said. ''It means being vigilant in the public realm. But you can go further still and say that poetry tries to help you to be a truer, purer, wholer being.''

HEADLINE: Who Will Prosper in the New World

BYLINE: TYLER COWEN


HIGHLIGHT: Who will prosper in the new, increasingly automated world? 

 BODY:
Self-driving vehicles threaten to send truck drivers to the unemployment office. Computer programs can now write journalistic accounts of sporting events and stock price movements. There are even computers that can grade essay exams with reasonable accuracy, which could revolutionize my own job, teaching. Increasingly, machines are providing not only the brawn but the brains, too, and that raises the question of where humans fit into this picture - who will prosper and who won't in this new kind of machine economy?
Who will do well? 
 THE CONSCIENTIOUS Within five years we will are likely to have the world's best education, or close to it, online and free. But not everyone will sit down and go through the material without a professor pushing them to do the work.
Those who are motivated to use online resources will do much, much better in the generations to come. It's already the case that the best students from India are at the top in many Coursera classes, putting America's arguably less motivated bright young people to shame. "Free" doesn't really help you if you don't make an effort.

 PEOPLE WHO LISTEN TO COMPUTERS Your smartphone will record data on your life and, when asked, will tell you what to do, drawing on data from your home or from your spouse and friends if need be. "You've thrown out that bread the last three times you've bought it, give it a pass" will be a text message of the future. How about "Now is not the time to start another argument with your wife"? The GPS is just the beginning of computer-guided instruction.
Take your smartphone on a date, and it might vibrate in your pocket to indicate "Kiss her now." If you hesitate for fear of being seen as pushy, it may write: "Who cares if you look bad? You are sampling optimally in the quest for a lifetime companion."Those who won't listen, or who rebel out of spite, will be missing out on glittering prizes. Those of us who listen, while often envied, may feel more like puppets with deflated pride.
 PEOPLE WITH A MARKETING TOUCH There will be a lot more wealth in this brave new world, but it won't be very evenly distributed because a lot of human labor won't seem like a special or scarce resource. Capturing the attention of customers with just the right human touch will command an increasing premium. Don't forget that Mark Zuckerberg was a psychology major in addition to being a tech genius. Sheer technical skill can be done by the machines, but integrating the tech side with an attention-grabbing innovation is a lot harder.
 MOTIVATORS A lot of jobs will consist of making people feel either very good or very bad about themselves. Coaches, mentors and disciplinarians will spread to many areas of life, at least for those of us who can stand to listen to them. These people will cajole us, flatter us and shame us into improving our lives, our work habits and our consumption. That's why so many people go to yoga class instead of relying on the podcast. Managers who are motivators of first-rate talent will see their earnings continue to rise.
Who will be most likely to suffer from this technological revolution?
 PEOPLE WITH DELICATE FEELINGS Computing and software will make it easier to measure performance and productivity.
It will be harder to gloss over our failings and maintain self-deception. In essence everyone will suffer the fate of professional chess players, who always know when they have lost a game, have an exact numerical rating for their overall performance, and find excuses for failure hard to come by.
Individuals will have many measures of their proficiency. They will have an incentive to disclose that information to get the better job or social opportunity. You'll assume the worst about those who keep secrets, and so openness will reign. Many of us will start to hate the idea of Big Data.
 PEOPLE UNLUCKY IN HEALTH CARE Quality surgery and cancer treatment cannot be automated very easily. They will be highly expensive, and unlucky health breaks will be all the more tragic because not everyone will be able to afford the best treatments.
With marvelous diagnosis available online, some people will get the right treatments early on, whereas others will know exactly what they are dying from.
 PEOPLE WHO DON'T NEED MONEY We are used to thinking in terms of rich, poor and middle class, but those categories will change. Berlin's eastern neighborhoods and Williamsburg, Brooklyn, are a window onto our future. These urban areas are full of people who are bright, culturally literate, Internet-savvy and far from committed to the idea of hard work directed toward earning a good middle-class living. We'll need a new name for the group of people who have the incomes of the lower middle class and the cultural habits of the wealthy or upper middle class. They will spread a libertarian worldview that working for other people full time is an abominable way to get by.
 POLITICAL RADICALS: A mechanized, computer-driven, highly unequal future is sometimes viewed as a recipe for rebellion. But the Edward J. Snowden saga shows this won't be easy, as tech is at least as much an instrument for surveillance and control as it is for revolt. We're also aging rapidly, and that tends to make society more peaceful, less violent and less extreme in all directions. It was the 1960s, a peak era for manufacturing jobs and the American middle class, that brought so much social turmoil and unrest. The more that work is done by machines, the less compelling is the case for putting your manufacturing in a distant country where wages are low. If there is any big winner from all of these trends, it is probably the good ol' United States.
 Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University and the author of the forthcoming book "Average is Over," from which this essay is adapted.
