Talks in Northern Ireland May Soon Include Sinn Fein
Gerry Adams, the president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army, said he had urged the guerrilla group to resume a cease-fire and expected a positive reply soon. A cease-fire would allow Sinn Fein to take part in Northern Ireland peace talks. 1
 
A New Crew May Fix Mir
Crew members on the Russian space station Mir were ordered to get three days of rest after a series of mishaps damaged the space station's power supply. Russian ground officials said they would probably wait for a new crew to arrive before undertaking a space walk to repair the damage. 5
 
Kenya Arrests 7 for Massacre
Kenyan police arrested seven high-ranking officials in the former Rwandan Government. The officials were accused of being part of a hard-line Hutu elite that planned and carried out genocide against Tutsi civilians in 1994 before the government was overthrown. The arrests were made at the request of the United Nations war crimes tribunal in Tanzania, and suggested warmer relations between Rwanda and President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya. 4
 
U.S. Pressure Urged on China
The former secretary of Wei Jingsheng, China's most prominent political prisoner, said Washington should pressure Beijing to release him or at least to improve his conditions. Tong Yi, herself freed from a prison camp last year, described the pro-democracy movement in China as at its lowest ebb since 1989. She urged the Administration to pressure President Jiang Zemin in the process of arranging his upcoming state visit. 5
 
Lethal Rains in Central Europe
Flags were at half-staff as Poland held a national day of mourning for the 48 people who have died so far in flooding that has devastated the south of the country and wrought havoc and destruction across central Europe. Heavy rain was expected to continue in the Czech Republic, where at least 48 people have died.

Canada Laments Overfishing
In a terse missive to Washington, Canada accused the United States of breaching an international treaty by overfishing in Alaska. Alaskan fishermen have caught about 350,000 sockeye salmon bound for Canadian waters so far in 1997, triple the average of previous years, Fisheries Minister David Anderson contended in Ottawa.

Angry Gorilla Nabs Fugitive
An angry gorilla at the Johannesburg Zoo in South Africa corralled a man who trespassed in his area while trying to flee the police. The suspect shot the 260-pound lowland gorilla, without being able to subdue the animal. The police finally shot the suspect but had to knock the furious gorilla out with a tranquilizer dart during the fracas. The suspect was hospitalized but all other parties escaped serious injury.

Police Say Murder Spree Began With Cryptic Remark
Just before the killings began, Andrew Cunanan told friends in San Diego that he was flying to Minnesota to "settle some business" with an old friend, Jeff Trail. It is perhaps the most tantalizing clue in the mystery of why Mr. Cunanan began what the police call a murderous spree, starting with the killing of Mr. Trail, an engineer, on April 27, and the shooting of another friend, David Madson, a Minneapolis architect, six days later. Mr. Cunanan continues to elude the authorities in the Miami area, where he is wanted in the killing on Tuesday of the fashion designer Gianni Versace. 1
 
G.O.P. Votes Against Change
Republican Party members endorsed the recommendations of a study group that opposes campaign spending limits, opposing public financing of campaigns, but favors preserving political action committees and continuing to allow parties to raise and spend "soft money," which is often used by the parties to skirt Federal campaign finance regulations. 8
 
Donor Faces Record Fine
The Federal Election Commission levied a $323,000 fine against a German businessman, the largest penalty ever against an individual for campaign finance violations. In a settlement agreement, Thomas Kramer admitted to making illegal campaign contributions directly, through his businesses and through his secretary to a number of state and Federal party committees and candidates. 8
 
Bullets Missing in King Case
After a week of searching, prosecutors said they still had not found the bullets fired 29 years ago in F.B.I. tests of the rifle they believe was used by James Earl Ray to assassinate the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Proving that the .30-06 rifle did not fire the shot that killed Dr. King is crucial to Mr. Ray's efforts to win a new trial because his fingerprints were found on the rifle. 7
 
Gore Defends Balanced Budget
Vice President Al Gore defended the Clinton Administration's drive for a balanced budget against those in his party who say that strict balance is less important than investment and economic growth. While he never mentioned his rival by name, Mr. Gore was clearly answering Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House minority leader who is expected to challenge him for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 2000. 7
 
New Charges in Army Case
The Army charged its most senior enlisted soldier with sexual misconduct involving a female officer, the fifth woman to come forward since the investigation against him began last February. The woman, a major based in Europe and the first officer to make such accusations, said that in 1994, when she was a captain, Sergeant Major Gene C. McKinney assaulted her on one occasion and asked her to have sex on another, Army officials said. 6

Storms Cause 3 Deaths And Many Power Outages
Severe thunderstorms flashed across the metropolitan region, knocking out power lines and uprooting trees in bursts of rain, wind and lightning that left two people dead in Queens and one in New Jersey. The storms caused power failures from central New Jersey to eastern Long Island. 1
 
Immigration Law Rejected
A Federal judge ruled that despite a longstanding New York City policy, city workers cannot be forbidden from alerting the authorities if an illegal immigrant is using public hospitals, schools or other city services. The decision marked a setback for Mayor Giuliani, who had sued to restore a city policy that allowed undocumented aliens access to services without fear of being reported to the Federal Government. 21
 
Successor Sought at CUNY
The chairwoman of the board at the City University of New York, Dr. Anne A. Paolucci, accused the outgoing chancellor of "virtually lying" to the trustees, and asserted that the new Chancellor would have to have "good personal chemistry" with her. Chancellor W. Ann Reynolds said this week that she had accepted a job as president of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. 23

Court Reverses F.C.C. Rule
A Federal appeals court struck down key elements of the Federal Communications Commission's rules for opening local telephone markets to competition.

HEADLINE: Merchants With Stubborn Hopes;
Welfare Cuts Don't Dash the Optimism of Store Owners

SERIES: WELFARE NEIGHBORHOOD: Hoping for profits in a new era

BYLINE: By JOE SEXTON 

 BODY:
William Rodriguez and his financial backers understood the risks when they decided to reopen a supermarket on Havemeyer Street in the Southside section of Williamsburg. Welfare, which for years had accounted for the bulk of the supermarket's revenues, was being overhauled. The number of people on public assistance was shrinking, and benefits, including food stamps, were being denied to tens of thousands of legal immigrants, hundreds of whom live in the Brooklyn neighborhood. A supermarket association was reporting that business was off by 10 percent in the city as a result of the changes.
Mr. Rodriguez, who had come to Southside from the Dominican Republic at age 9 and whose first job was in his father's bodega on Grand Avenue, listened to people call him irresponsible for even thinking about taking a chance in such circumstances. 
 But Mr. Rodriguez, with bank loans and credit from wholesalers, made the deal this spring. And in so doing, he made a large private bet on the future of welfare reform -- a $1 million gamble that his C-Town Supermarket could make it, that even in a welfare-dependent neighborhood facing significant change there was still plenty of money to be made.
"People have said that I am crazy, that more changes are coming, that the location depends too much on public assistance," said Mr. Rodriguez, who owns three other supermarkets in the city. "Maybe the people will find work, and the neighborhood will improve. Maybe, though, I live in another world."
For Mr. Rodriguez and other local business people, who have never been on welfare and are not targets of the effort to end welfare dependency, the overhaul of the country's system of public assistance is an intensely personal matter. As much as 80 percent of his Southside supermarket's business has been in food stamps, so profound changes in his clientele's incomes could produce serious changes in his own.
For the moment, Mr. Rodriguez, 36, is convinced that he can make money. He opened the Southside store after its previous owner closed it and filed for bankruptcy when a loan bid failed. And he bluntly says that his concerns are more about profit margins than the social safety net. "People will have to eat," he said.
The stakes are high for Mr. Rodriguez, as well as for Santa Valdez, a 22-year-old cashier, Willie Palino, a 37-year-old stocker, and 18 other store employees. And the fortunes of other stores along Havemeyer Street, many of which benefit from the shopping traffic the supermarket generates, will be shaped, as well, by its fate.
Proponents of the revision of welfare are convinced that Mr. Rodriguez, the store and the neighborhood's commercial life will prosper. As people move off welfare and into private jobs, they say, their incomes will improve and so will the fragile economy of Southside.
But skeptics abound, both here and across the country, where other poor neighborhoods face the same uncertain future -- and where the early evidence is not encouraging.
Mr. Rodriguez, whose other supermarkets are in working-class neighborhoods in the Bronx, Queens and Manhattan, is president of the National Supermarkets Association, a trade group for independent supermarket owners. He said members of the association throughout the city have reported a 10 percent reduction in total sales over the last year, a falloff they attribute to fewer food stamps. Such shifts can have major ramifications for stores operating at the margins of profitability. More than three-quarters of the $300,000 in business Mr. Rodriguez did in his first month came from food stamps.
In Cleveland, officials with the Council for Economic Opportunities, a nonprofit organization, studied the reductions in welfare caseloads in the city's 93 neighborhoods over the last three years. The neighborhood with the highest proportion of people on welfare, the analysis found, had lost 14 percent of its aggregate income.
"If Wall Street had lost one-seventh of its money, you would have people jumping out of windows," said George Zeller, who conducted the Cleveland study.
In the Glendale section of Los Angeles, a neighborhood of 40,000 people that has the highest percentage of legal immigrants in the country, reductions in food stamps will decrease spending on food by 7 percent, or $5.5 million, according to researchers at the University of Southern California.
Clearly, Southside's economic staples -- welfare dollars and food stamps -- are diminishing. More than 10 percent of the people in the neighborhood on welfare (those on welfare automatically qualify for food stamps) have been moved into private jobs or merely removed from the rolls over the last three years. And Southside's supply of food stamps will decrease further. Next month, 100,000 legal immigrants in the city who currently receive the coupons will be cut off as a result of last summer's vast Federal revision of welfare.
The reductions occur in an already bleak commercial landscape. The five blocks of Havemeyer Street that make up the heart of the commercial strip have 59 storefront operations. Seven are variety stores, six of them beauty or nail salons. A dozen are boarded up. Merchants, from Victor Franqui at the travel agency off South Second Street to Sonia Lowenbraun at Lowen's Variety on South First Street, say business is the worst it has been in a half-dozen years.
"So much of this debate has focused on clients," said Jennifer Wolch, a professor at the University of Southern California who produced the report on Glendale, "but not on the places in which these policies play out."
They have already played out starkly at the Latin Corner, a bodega on South Second Street owned by Angel Feliciano. Mr. Feliciano did $3,200 in food stamp business in June, about two-thirds of the store's receipts for the month. Mr. Feliciano said that in a good month two years ago, he took in $5,500 in food stamps. And competition is stiff: in addition to Mr. Rodriguez's supermarket three blocks away, there are 52 other bodegas in the surrounding 25-square-block vicinity.
And, as in the supermarket's case, more is at stake than Mr. Feliciano's own income, which he says is roughly $24,000 a year. The Latin Corner extends credit to customers, as many bodegas do. Credit is a vital component in the minimalist machinery of a welfare-dependent neighborhood's economy, and if the bodega closes, there will be less available credit, less in the way of survival tools. The Latin Corner also provides occasional odd jobs to the older men who play cards every day in the back.
"I don't know how most of these people live now," Mr. Feliciano said. "Without me, without credit, it won't be easier. Maybe I can hold on for another five years, go back to Puerto Rico. But business hasn't been this bad in years. I used to be able to do $1,500 worth of food stamps in a day if it was near the first of the month. No more."
There is consensus, among experts in the grocery industry and academics who study the economic impact of changes in welfare, that bodegas will be squeezed harder and earlier than supermarkets by the shifts in public assistance. Mr. Feliciano does not doubt it.
Born in Lares, Puerto Rico, and the son of a sugar cane cutter, Mr. Feliciano came to New York at 21 and drove trucks. Six years ago, he rented the storefront, sank $7,000 into refurbishing and stocking it, borrowed from loan sharks and became a neighborhood fixture.
Mr. Feliciano, now 35, can still make $100 in food stamps in an hour of making sandwiches. One recent morning, Alex Rodriguez, 9, came to buy three sandwiches, turning over a handful of coupons. Juan Cortes, a recipient of Federal disability welfare benefits, spends his food stamps in the bodega because Mr. Feliciano will cash his Government check.
Lorraine Morgan, working after 15 years on welfare, still receives food stamps because her income is so modest. And she still spends them at the Latin Corner because Mr. Feliciano extended her credit when she needed it. "Look, the taxpayers have been paying for the crooked side of welfare for years, and so if they go after those people who are cheating, that's great," Mr. Feliciano said. "Food stamps are my business. People say there will be more money in the streets with jobs. We'll see."
It is impossible to project how much income will be lost or gained in a neighborhood under welfare reform. But officials with Community Food Resources, a nonprofit advocacy organization that has done extensive research on both welfare reform and the supermarket industry, did a computer analysis of Southside's welfare and food stamp caseloads. The organization estimated that in 2002, when recipients begin to approach the new Federal five-year limit on cash benefits, total welfare and food stamp payments could be $17.3 million less a year than if the welfare system had not been changed. That figure would represent about one-tenth of the neighborhood's aggregate income. Southside, with a population of nearly 30,000, has an aggregate income of $160 million.
Economists and social scientists say any number of things could happen as the welfare system changes. Some people now on welfare might move into what is known as the informal, or underground economy. As it is, many people in the neighborhood already work in the world of unreported income, from off-the-books factory workers to women selling meals from their kitchen.
"There might be jobs, but not likely reliable jobs," said Bennett Harrison, a dean at the New School for Social Research who has studied economic development in urban neighborhoods. "Demand for credit will go up; the ability to pay will go down. Welfare was many things, not the least of which was reliable."
And so Mr. Rodriguez, the supermarket owner, frets and strategizes. He said he would have to take in $100,000 a week to have a chance of survival. Aware that the neighborhood is undergoing increasing gentrification by young white artists from Manhattan, he has stocked Boar's Head meats and Ben and Jerry's ice cream. And because he often does two-thirds of his month's business in the first days of the month because of the timing of Government benefits payments, he staggers his workforce, often laying off cashiers at the end of the month.
"I worry," he said. "And I look for another way of doing business."
 
Welfare Neighborhood
 The nation's welfare system is being reshaped by an array of new Federal, state and local laws and regulations. Since March 10, this series has examined how the changes come together in one Brooklyn neighborhood, Southside in Williamsburg. Other articles have examined fear of change, welfare fraud, and the closing of a welfare office.

Japanese Official Backs Corporate Tax Cut

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Japan's Vice Trade Minister, Osamu Watanabe, said yesterday that the Government should cut Japan's corporate income taxes by 10 percent. Mr. Watanabe was asked at a news conference for his opinion on the Ministry of International Trade and Industry's recently released report on taxes and economic growth. That report said cutting the corporate tax rate by 5 percent would stimulate enough economic growth to eliminate the deficit within five years. 
 Japan and Germany both have 50 percent corporate tax rates, the highest in the industrialized world. By comparison, the United States corporate tax rate is 41.1 percent, and Britain's is 33 percent.

Stanley Works Cuts Jobs And Refocuses Products
Almost one-quarter of the employees, or about 4,700 workers, of Stanley Works will lose their jobs as the company, a manufacturer of hand tools and hardware products, moves to refocus its businesses. 
 The overhaul comes as John M. Trani, the chairman and chief executive who joined Stanley in January from General Electric, starts a much-anticipated program to improve revenues and profits at the company, based in New Britain, Conn. [Page 33.]
 
Court Slows Phone Competition
The rocky road toward telecommunications deregulation received another blow yesterday as an appeals court struck down key elements of the Federal Communications Commission's rules for opening local telephone markets to competition. The decision could slow the start of unbridled competition and the lower prices expected to result from that competition, because it would allow states to develop different rules for bringing new companies into the market rather than following uniform F.C.C. guidelines. [1]
 
Talks for Sale of Signature End
Montgomery Ward and HFS have ended talks for the sale of Ward's Signature Group direct-marketing unit. Ward rejected a revised offer from HFS, contending that it was too low and set too many conditions. Montgomery Ward filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws last week. [35.]
 
Columbia Employees Subpoenaed
Four employees involved in obtaining reimbursement from Medicare for hospitals operated by Columbia/HCA Healthcare have been subpoenaed to testify before a Federal grand jury in Florida, people with knowledge of the situation said. Federal prosecutors are investigating whether Columbia hospitals illegally inflated those cost reports for the purpose of increasing reimbursement from Medicare. [33]

Trade and Stocks Hurt Dollar
News of the trade deficit's rise to $10.2 billion in May, a selloff in the stock market and a Japanese minister's forecast of higher Japanese interest rate sent the dollar lower. But traders said the trend for the dollar remained up. The dollar settled at 115.57 yen in New York, down from 116.07 Thursday, but up from 114.02 yen a week earlier. Against the mark, the dollar settled at 1.7927 marks, down from 1.7941 marks, but up from 1.7744 marks a week earlier. [30]
 
Treasury Prices Fall
Investor concern over next week's Congressional testimony by the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, sent the prices of Treasury securities down. The yield on the 30-year bond, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.52 percent, from 6.49 percent on Thursday. [41]
 
Prices of Crude Oil Decline
Crude oil prices fell as a hurricane moved away from production and import sites in the Gulf of Mexico, ending speculation that supplies would be disrupted. Corn and soybean futures rose after predictions of rain for parched portions of the Corn Belt proved wrong. [30]
 
A Buyer for The American Lawyer
The investment banking firm Wasserstein Perella is buying the magazine The American Lawyer and its sister publications from Time Warner Inc. Terms of the sale were not announced. Time Warner said in February that it was buying the stake held in American Lawyer Media L.P. by Steven Brill, its founder. [33]
 
Connecticut Deal Faulted
The awarding of nearly $20 million of business to Morgan Stanley has come under criticism from Connecticut auditors. They said the State Treasurer, Christopher B. Burnham, should have completed a written agreement with the firm when he hired it to reinvest $6 billion from the state pension fund. Mr. Burnham is expected to leave office next week. [24.]

Campaigning to Be Seen in a New Light

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT 

 BODY:
IT'S hard to know how seriously to take Geraldo Rivera when he says that his goal is to be "one of the wise men" of his generation. Certainly not as seriously as he seems to take the sentiment himself. But perhaps a bit more seriously than one would have thought possible a mere five years ago when, in front of a live audience, Mr. Rivera underwent cosmetic surgery involving the transfer of fat from his rear to his face.
For the last few years, Mr. Rivera has been engaged in a very public crusade for journalistic redemption, telling almost anyone who cares to listen that he is not the man America apparently mistook him for in the late 1980's, when his name became practically synonymous with sleazy talk show fare. 
 "I've run far away from butt fat in my forehead and chairs thrown in my nose," Mr. Rivera said solemnly during a recent interview.
About half an hour before the interview, he had charged into his office at CNBC headquarters in Fort Lee, N.J., to begin work on his third show of the day. That afternoon, in Manhattan, he had taped two episodes of his syndicated daytime program, "The Geraldo Rivera Show." And now, as the sun set over the Palisades, he was preparing to go on the air with his nightly legal affairs show, "Rivera Live."
In his campaign for renewed respectability, Mr. Rivera has been greatly assisted by his affiliation with CNBC and three-year-old "Rivera Live," which is shown on the cable network at 9 P.M. As Mr. Rivera himself likes to point out, before he was a journalist he was a lawyer -- he graduated near the top of his class at Brooklyn Law School -- and he clearly enjoys the jargon-strewn legal sparring that goes on every night on "Rivera Live."
Mr. Rivera argues that despite his celebrity as a daytime personality, he actually feels more at home in the comparatively sedate world of evening television. "I've always felt that daytime -- and now remember I'm finishing my 10th year -- it wasn't my strong suit," Mr. Rivera said. "I've always felt a little bit like Michael Jordan when he went to play baseball. My strong suit is what I'm doing right now."
To be sure, "Rivera Live" is not as much of a stretch from daytime television as its host sometimes makes it out to be; it seems safe to assume that few viewers are tuning in for insight into the weightier legal questions of the day. With the end of the O. J. Simpson trials, "Rivera Live" has leaned heavily on the lurid and as yet still-unsolved killing of 6-year-old JonBenet Ramsey, and is far more likely to feature a segment on the rape trial of Alex Kelly than on, say, the question of attorney-client privilege as it relates to White House lawyers.
The show started out as a general news program, but shifted gears when Mr. Simpson took off in his white Bronco. During Mr. Simpson's murder trial, "Rivera Live" became the show of choice for true O. J. junkies; virtually every night of the criminal trial, Mr. Rivera and his guests dissected the events of the day, sometimes with the help of key participants like Christopher Darden and Mark Fuhrman.
In February, when the verdict in the Simpson civil trial was announced, nearly two million households tuned in to "Rivera Live," making it the top-rated prime-time program in CNBC history.
At the same time that Mr. Rivera has been working on his redemption in prime time, he has also made a concerted effort to clean up his act during the day. As People magazine recently pointed out, Mr. Rivera's daytime show will still "never be confused with '60 Minutes.' " But it has become a lot more staid, and it has the lower ratings to prove it.
"In the glory days we got about a four and half," Mr. Rivera said. "Now we get about a two and a half."
"A clean two and a half," he added, "is better than a dirty four and a half."
As in all good television stories, Mr. Rivera's decision to tone down his daytime show features a moment of epiphany. "It happened in a single day," he related. "I just said: 'Oh, this is absolutely appalling. I'm not going on.' "
"We had finished a show that never aired -- I saw it on 'Sally' a couple weeks ago -- called 'Terrible Family Secrets,' " he continued. "And I had just finished telling a real abusive, wife-beating young punk that his wife was leaving him and that one of their two kids wasn't his. He stood up and punched the set wall and said 'Thanks, Geraldo,' as he stormed off the stage."
After the taping was over, one of the show's producers pronounced, "We're going to hell," Mr. Rivera recalled. "And I said, 'We're already there.' And that's when I decided to quit."
Mr. Rivera maintains that he was genuinely thinking of quitting his day job when William J. Bennett, the former Secretary of Education and self-styled virtues czar, made him think again.
"It was Bill Bennett who brought me back with all his criticism of talk shows," he said. "I thought it was so politically motivated and hypocritical. I said: 'Damn it, I'm not going to leave this business with my tail between my legs. I'm going to try my best to resurrect what is left of my professional reputation.' "
In fact, for those with long enough memories, Mr. Rivera's professional reputation is a substantial one. In 1972, as a young reporter for WABC-TV, he slipped into the Willowbrook State School for the mentally retarded and exposed the dreadful conditions there, winning several awards for his efforts. Later, working for ABC, he became one of the highest-paid correspondents on television.
He was working for ABC's "20/20" in 1985 when a dispute with Roone Arledge, then head of the network's news division, forced him out. Mr. Rivera took the dispute public, a move he now says he deeply regrets.
"Roone's a good man," Mr. Rivera said. "He deserved better."
After a few months of unemployment, Mr. Rivera received an offer to play host for a syndicated special on Al Capone. His agent recommended that for the sake of his journalistic reputation he turn it down; Mr. Rivera accepted. During the special, he blasted open what was supposedly Capone's vault. The show was being broadcast live, and much to Mr. Rivera's horror, the vault was empty.
"It was the most humiliating night of my life," he recalled. "But the fact of the matter is the next day I had 22 job offers."
Mr. Rivera says he is not sure what he will do next; his contracts with CNBC and for his daytime show expire within the next year. But he insists that whatever he does, it will be something he can be proud of. And his efforts in this direction, he maintains, are already paying off.
"What I find in the post-Simpson era is that I hear a lot less about the chair and Capone," he said. "I used to think that those things would be engraved on my tombstone. Now I'm confident that they'll just be part of my overall experience."

 THE DEATH OF
 THE BANKER
 The Decline and Fall of
 the Great Financial Dynasties and the Triumph of
 the Small Investor.
 By Ron Chernow.
 130 pp. New York:
 Vintage Books. Paper, $12. 
 My idea of the perfect vacation book is shaped by the fact that I commute by bus and tend to lug my workaday reading material around on a 40-something shoulder. Not until long lakeside afternoons in Vermont await me can I gather up the fat histories that I crave -- Simon Schama's "Citizens," at a robust 948 pages, or Richard Rhodes's "Making of the Atomic Bomb," at 886 pages, or Ron Chernow's book "The Warburgs," at a comparatively svelte 820 pages. So when I heard there was a new Chernow in store for this summer, I immediately reserved space next to the croquet set and mosquito spray.
 But what's this? A paperback original light enough for the bus stop? From Ron Chernow, as elegant an architect of monumental histories as we've seen in decades? He calls this slim volume "The Death of the Banker." Some fastidious fans will inevitably call it "Financial History for Dummies" or "Chernow Lite." But I call it a delight -- an intimate chat with a writer so thoughtful and well informed about his topic that one closes the book feeling far more worldly and intelligent than when one opened it.
The heft of Chernow's earlier works did not deter the critics. "The House of Morgan" won the National Book Award for nonfiction, and the Warburg book was honored with the Columbia Business School's Eccles Prize for economic writing. With a track record like that, Chernow could easily have found an audience for a book as big as a sumo wrestler -- indeed, he admits to being at work on a biography of John D. Rockefeller Sr., a canvas certainly large enough for his talents. So why this delicate effort?
 He explains in a disarmingly wry introduction: "Sometimes authors are guilty of such excruciating subtlety that even their most faithful readers fail to spot the themes artfully embedded in their work. Such, I fear, was the case with my two lengthy sagas of banking dynasties. . . . I welcome the chance to exhume those buried themes."
 That chance grew out of an invitation to give the Barbara Frum Memorial Lecture in Toronto, in honor of a noted Canadian broadcaster, in April of this year. The first third of "The Death of the Banker" -- for readers of Chernow's earlier books, by far the most fascinating section -- is an expansion of that engaging speech. The two final sections, on J. Pierpont Morgan and the Warburgs, are nouvelle cuisine versions of Chernow's first two books. But for readers who have not yet devoured them, this book can serve as an appetizer for the feast ahead.
 "In this trio of essays, I try to explain why the financial dynasties have receded to the status of historic dinosaurs," Chernow writes. Merchant bankers like the Morgans and the Warburgs were essentially "glorified go-betweens" who connected the users of capital (governments and businesses, mostly) with the providers of capital (savers and investors of all sorts). When investors were wary and scattered, and businesses and governments were exceedingly needy, bankers held most of the cards. How they lost that winning hand, amid this century's epochal changes in the scale of business and the nature of investing, is the theme that Chernow feared had sunk beneath the abundant details of his earlier books.
 He is too hard on himself. But if we have self-flagellation to thank for this illuminating treatise, I say hooray for it. And perhaps next summer will bring that Rockefeller biography?

HEADLINE: Market Analysis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 My review of "The Big Ten," Jeffrey E. Garten's study of big emerging markets, observed that one of its central arguments is based on a wildly inaccurate claim about the markets' current economic importance to the United States. In his response (Letters, June 29), Garten counters my "highly misleading" claim that American exports to "many" of the Big 10 countries are growing relatively slowly by observing that in 1996 American merchandise sales to these markets collectively grew nearly twice as fast as sales to industrialized countries. But the aggregate figures he cites mask wide divergences among the Big 10. 
 From 1988 to 1996, American merchandise exports to some Big 10 countries, like Mexico, Argentina, Poland and Indonesia, grew considerably faster than American worldwide merchandise exports -- which increased 94 percent. But exports to other Big 10 countries -- Turkey, India and South Africa -- grew considerably more slowly, and American exports to some of the fastest-growing Big 10 markets, like Poland, Indonesia and Argentina, are expanding from tiny bases.
 Moreover, the Big 10 aggregates are significantly skewed by Mexico, whose share of American merchandise exports to these countries grew from 37.3 percent in 1988 to 40.3 percent in 1996. In fact, Mexico accounted for more than 42 percent of all the American merchandise export growth to the Big 10 during this period.
 Mexico is especially important for another reason. As a study sponsored by the Clinton Administration reported, the increase in United States-Mexico trade since the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement has been driven "almost entirely" by the growth of intracompany trade. Such trade consists of American multinational corporations "exporting" parts and components of products to Mexico for further processing, and re-exporting the final products back to the United States. Mexican statistics indicate that such exports jumped from 40 percent of the total American goods exported to Mexico in 1993 to 62 percent in 1996.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Honolulu

BYLINE: By JOCELYN FUJII; JOCELYN FUJII, author of "Under the Hula Moon" (Crown), lives in Honolulu.

 BODY:
Honolulu residents are endlessly amused by the mainlanders' penchant for proclaiming Hawaii seasonless. Local people know it's spring when gardenias and pikake (jasmine) reappear and the air around Chinatown's lei stands is thick with their heady fragrances tempering the scents of burning mugwort, dried herbs and fresh fish. Hand-painted "Mangoes 4 Sale" signs beckon along country roads, and the voluptuous fruit, along with litchis, bulge on trees, all the better to fuel the picnics and festivals of summertime Honolulu.
Islanders know they can count on these things despite the wilting morale induced by a beleaguered economy and the second-highest cost of living in the nation (San Francisco is first, New York City third). But at the beaches and parks, music, hula, feasting and festivals are a balm for the spirit: the barbecues are alight, and the ocean is at its warmest. 
 One summer celebration is the annual tribute to the man who ruled as King Kamehameha V in the 1860's. The death of Lot Kamehameha, a self-proclaimed nativist and take-charge king, in 1872 ended the 77-year-old Kamehameha dynasty, but his legacy continues at the Prince Lot Hula Festival, which is holding its 20th anniversary this weekend. Lot was all for the Hawaiian monarchy and did what he could to revive Hawaiian traditions such as the hula and the native religious practices suppressed by missionaries. Lot Kamehameha would be proud to see the resurgence of things Hawaiian celebrated at the tree-shaded Moanalua Gardens, just off H1 (take the Tripler Hospital exit), where loyalists and hula enthusiasts gather every summer in his name, on grounds owned by the estate of Samuel Mills Damon, a prominent missionary.
 
Events
 At Ward Seafood next Sunday, from 9 A.M. to 4 P.M. chefs, seafood and keiki (children's) hula share the limelight at three adjacent festival sites in the Ward Avenue-Ala Moana Boulevard area. Awaiting the hungry: seafood from top chefs ($2 tastings), cooking demonstrations, a Hawaii-food-products fair, and a chance to taste nine types of fish, side by side and simply prepared so that the subtle tastes and textures are easier to compare. Free, except for the food; call (808) 591-8411 for information.
Across town in the Diamond Head area, summer is in full swing with the Waikiki Aquarium's fund-raising concerts on Aug. 6 and 27, at 7:30 P.M. on its outdoor stage, right by the ocean. Hawaiian musicians (The Makaha Sons and Ka'au Crater Boys respectively) and traditional Hawaiian dancers will perform at sunset. Spectators can spread picnic suppers on the lawn and watch the sun set over the ocean and cast a golden halo on Diamond Head. Tickets are $15; Waikiki Aquarium, 2777 Kalakaua Avenue; (808) 923-9741.
Across the street from the Aquarium, at the Waikiki Shell in Kapiolani Park, Natalie Cole will sing during "An Unforgettable Evening With the Honolulu Symphony," with Charles Floyd as guest conductor, on Aug. 1 at 7:30 P.M. Reserved seats are $50 and $75; lawn tickets, $20. For tickets and information, contact Honolulu Symphony, 677 Ala Moana Boulevard, Suite 606; (808) 538-8863. Tickets may also be charged through The Connection, (800) 333-3388.
The Hawaii International Jazz Festival, which runs from July 31 through Aug. 3, has a new home this year: the Hawaii Theater. Built in 1922 in the Beaux-Arts style as a vaudeville movie palace, the theater reopened a year ago after a $22 million restoration of the interior. Concerts start at 7 P.M. and include the singers Linda Hopkins and Marlena Shaw and the saxophonist Ernie Watts. Tickets are $10, $18 and $25; Hawaii Theater Box Office, 1130 Bethel Street, (808) 528-0506, or The Connection, (800) 333-3388.
The Bankoh Ki Ho Alu Festival has a new home, too, on the grounds of the 104-year-old Bishop Museum, at 1525 Bernice Street, Kalihi, (808) 847-3511. The world's finest players of slack key acoustic guitar converge Aug. 17 for an all-day celebration of this soulful Hawaiian tradition. The music's unique, lingering resonance is created by slackening the strings for a variety of tunings, a technique introduced by Spanish and Mexican cowboys in the 1830's. 11 A.M. to 5 P.M.; $14.95.
 
Sightseeing
 Chinatown is now in full bloom with the harvests of summer. Exotic fruits -- sapodilla, soursop, dragon's eye, litchis, pirie mangoes -- disappear quickly at the Maunakea Marketplace, at the corner of Maunakea and Hotel streets. The takeout counters next to the market display a feast of ethnic cuisines, from Italian to Vietnamese to Filipino.
The Bishop Museum is showing an interactive exhibit called "Ocean Planet," developed by the Smithsonian Institution, through Oct. 5. A Hawaiian princess founded this four-story, lava rock museum, the world's greatest repository of cultural and natural artifacts from Hawaii and the Pacific. Feathered capes worn by kings, a grass house, 13 million insect specimens, a 50-foot sperm whale skeleton and rare wood implements are among the permanent exhibits. Open 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. daily; admission, $14.95; telephone, (808) 847-3511.
There are no grass houses or pre-Western works at the Contemporary Museum, one of Hawaii's pre-eminent cultural treasures; its six galleries, David Hockney pavilion, Oriental gardens, cafe, gift shop and newly opened Biennial of Hawaii Artists, through Sept. 21, are the lure. The works of six of Hawaii's foremost artists in various media are on display in this 1925 architectural marvel in the Tantalus neighborhood, a gracious, forested residential area with views of Diamond Head. The museum is at 2411 Makiki Heights Drive; (808) 526-0232. Open Tuesday to Saturday 10 A.M. to 4 P.M.; Sunday, noon to 4 P.M.; $5. The third Thursday of each month is free.
 
Where to Stay
 Hotel rates in Hawaii remain high, but this is the off season, which means lower prices than the December through April high season. The Diamond Head end of Waikiki is the place to be, particularly the New Otani Kaimana Beach Hotel, 2863 Kalakaua Avenue; (800) 356-8264, fax (808) 922-9404. The 125 rooms, in pastels and tropical decor, are on the third to ninth floors of an atrium-style building and have balconies and small refrigerators; some have kitchenettes. The New Otani is on the beach, near Kapiolani Park and the Waikiki Aquarium, and its restaurant, Hau Tree Lanai, is practically on the sand. Doubles: from $110.
Nearby, Diamond Head Bed and Breakfast is awash in the fragrances of Tahitian gardenias and puakenikeni, at the end of a drive lined with estates discreetly hidden behind royal palms and pandanus trees. An easy walk from Kapiolani Park and Sans Souci Beach, the house is nearly 50 years old and filled with family heirlooms, including the four-poster koa bed of Princess Ruth, who was reputed to have weighed more than 300 pounds. Immense trees in all directions shade the three units, each with a lanai. Doubles: $100 to $125. Book through Hawaii's Best Bed and Breakfasts, Post Office Box 563, Kamuela, Hawaii 96743; (800) 262-9912, fax (808) 885-0559.
Budget: The Royal Grove Hotel, 151 Uluniu Avenue, (808) 923-7691, fax (808) 922-7508, as pink as the Royal Hawaiian Hotel, is a tad frayed at the edges. But it is two blocks from Waikiki Beach, clean, convenient and friendly, with the usual amenities (phone, kitchenette, air-conditioning, TV), as well as a pool. Guests who can do without fluffy towels and room service will enjoy the price: doubles are $57.
Also near the beach is the Breakers, at the opposite end of Waikiki, 250 Beach Walk; (800) 426-0494, fax (808) 923-7174. The two-story walk-up has 64 units, a pool, lush foliage and a walkway leading to the Urasenke Foundation's tea room, where a free tea ceremony is open to visitors every Wednesday. All rooms have a kitchenette. Doubles: $91 and $97.
Luxury: The 456-room Halekulani, 2199 Kalia Road, (800) 367-2343, fax (808) 926-8004, remains the darling of Honolulu, unfailingly gracious in its attention to detail. In plush rooms with lanais, three phones and all the comforts (an individual toaster for hot toast is supplied with room service), you can see Diamond Head even from the bathtubs. The House Without a Key, the hotel's informal outdoor cafe, is the favorite place for sunset Mai Tais and hula under a 100-year-old kiawe tree, close to the swimming pool with an orchid mosaic on the bottom. The Halekulani's two swanky restaurants, Orchids and La Mer, have considerable followings. Doubles from $295.
Five miles from Waikiki, in an upscale residential area, the 370-room Kahala Mandarin Oriental, 5000 Kahala Avenue, (800) 367-2525, fax (808) 739-8800, tries hard to reclaim the loyalty it once held as the Kahala Hilton. Away from the crowds of Waikiki, hotel balconies look over the mountains, golf course or the ocean, and the rooms are tasteful (grass cloth walls, four-poster beds). Some look over a lagoon where dolphins leap and spin. Old-timers may miss the old Plumeria Cafe and Maile Restaurant, but the new Hoku's has better views, international cuisine and a bamboo floor. Doubles start at $275.
 
Where to Eat
 At the top is Alan Wong's Restaurant, the shrine of Hawaii regional cuisine, on the fifth floor at 1857 South King Street, (808) 949-2526. Here you can dine indoors next to an open kitchen, or in a glassed-in terrace with mountain and street views. Specials include ahi lumpia, fresh scallops in saffron sauce, and grilled opakapaka (pink snapper). Mr. Wong should get a medal for his rose-apple sorbet. Dinner for two with wine: $120 to $160.
At A Pacific Cafe, Jean-Marie Josselin, triathlete and master chef, shows how he lost 40 pounds while serving feasts at four restaurants. His new light menu is a counterpoint to the regular selection -- with such offerings as tiger-eye sushi tempura, butter-tender ribeye steak and the signature sesame-crusted mahi mahi -- not designed for deprivation. Dinner for two with wine: about $120. The restaurant, decorated in shades of blue and gold with lamps made with beach glass, is at Ward Center, 1200 Ala Moana Boulevard; (808) 593-0035.
In an industrial area toward the airport, at 580 North Nimitz Highway, Sam Choy's new Breakfast, Lunch and Crab is one of the busiest spots in Honolulu. A diner by day and a crab house by night, it serves superb king crab legs, fresh oysters and stone crab, unusual for Hawaii, in a huge room with brewery vats, an oyster bar and an authentic wooden sampan that serves as a dining area. Enormous servings are Choy's signature. Fried poke (fresh tuna) omelet and wok-cooked chicken and saimin (noodle soup topped with crab and condiments) are noteworthy items for breakfast or lunch. Dinner for two with microbrewed beer: about $90. Breakfast and lunch are much less. Telephone: (808) 545-7979.
At Hawaii Seafood Paradise, 1830 Ala Moana Boulevard, (808) 946-4514, you may be the only non-Chinese diner. Among the crowd-pleasers are nine types of duck (the Peking is superb), sizzling platters, 228 Cantonese and Szechuan items (including an excellent Thai-style prawn soup that's not on the menu) and the hours -- open until 3 A.M. Dinner for two with beer: about $50.
Inland from Waikiki, not far from Alan Wong's, is Jimbo's, 1936 South King Street, (808) 947-2211. Customers must bring their own alcohol to this noodle house, which has fewer than a dozen tables. Homemade noodles come in savory, smoky homemade broths, with equally tasty vegetable and chicken toppings. The menu also includes cold noodles, fried noodles and steamed-rice dishes called donburi. Dinner for two: about $20.

HEADLINE: Personal Perspective On the Sound

BYLINE: By FRED MUSANTE 

 BODY:
FROM the observation tower at the Connecticut Audubon Society's coastal center at Milford Point, Mary Parker Buckles, author of nature books, pointed out a small, weathered wooden platform barely visible about a half mile west down the barrier beach. "That's where I wrote the shorebirds section of my book," she said.
The observation perch presents a panoramic view of the Milford Point salt marshes, the mouth of the Housatonic River and the dunes, beach and sandbars that make up the Charles E. Wheeler Wildlife Management Area and part of the Stewart B. McKinney National Wildlife Refuge. It is a place where ospreys, shore birds and snow white herons and egrets nest and soar. 
 From that vantage, Mrs. Buckles explained how each day she watched the shore birds lift into the air from their roosts on the beach side and fly to the marshes as the incoming tide coaxed out a bounty of succulent crabs, worms, fish and other tasty treats.
Her latest book, published in June, "Margins: A Naturalist Meets Long Island Sound," is about such places, where the land, the sea, the air and the marshes join. Mrs. Buckles, a native of Jackson, Miss., who arrived in Darien in 1989, said she began working on "Margins" virtually from her first day as a Connecticut resident.
The result is a work that celebrates the beauty of the Sound, describes the lives of its wild inhabitants and narrates her personal adventure in getting to know the estuary.
She has managed to do this without indulging in the excess and sentimentality that makes mush of much nature writing, by grounding her narrative in accurate science and the stories of many of the scientists and wildlife advocates who watch over the Sound.
Mrs. Buckles explained that most of what has been written about Long Island Sound has focused on its problems -- low oxygen levels that cause periodic summer fish kills, toxic algae blooms, the loss of wildlife habitats, sewage spills and floating trash. While she didn't ignore these problems, she chose a different direction.
" 'Margins' is not a prescription for how to behave on the Sound," she said.
A central motif is her gradual discovery of the estuary, beginning with the view from the windows of her home.
"This is a first-person, impressionistic account," she said. "That idea of discovery is what I think makes this book interesting to someone elsewhere."
Mrs. Buckles lived in Mississippi until she went to Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn., for her graduate degree in English literature. Her father was a biologist and her mother an avid gardener. In 1970, she and her husband, Steve, an economist, moved to New York City where she found a job as an editor preparing educational materials at the National Audubon Society. "It brought together my interest in the natural world and my interest in literature," she said.
In 1975, she and her husband moved to Missouri, where she wrote her first three books: "Mammals of North America" and "Animals of North America," guides to identifying animals in their habitats, and "The Flowers Around Us," a collection of her father's closeup photographs with her text explaining the flowers' natures. She wrote the introduction to the latter book in the first person, and found it comfortable.
In Connecticut, having been an inland and city resident most of her life, she was captivated by the shoreline environment. "I got caught up in this," she said. "I never lived anywhere before that just took my breath away."
She immediately began writing down her observations, about such things as the quality of the light over the water and the rhythm of the tides. "Gradually, as I began to make these entries, I became aware that they were taking form," she said.
Mrs. Buckles explained that she approached the Sound as if it had a personality of its own, and she got to know it as a person who changed in different seasons. "I focused on things that were close to home, and that I was comfortable with, at first," she said.
Then she ranged out along the shoreline, meeting fishermen, scientists and conservation officials, and accompanying them on their missions on the water, bays and tidal creeks -- whether harvesting oysters or banding ospreys.
She described the osprey as the perfect symbol for the Sound. It nests in high perches, soars over the tidal marshes and feeds on fish offshore. That defines the margins that give her book its title, she said.
Good nature writing "is literature or it's nothing," noted Annie Dillard, who won the Pulitzer Prize in 1975 for "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek," a work that explored theology and nature. "There's nothing intrinsically superior to the form," said Ms. Dillard, who is writer in residence at Wesleyan University. But there is one requirement for any writer who attempts the genre: serious attention to natural science. "You have to know your stuff," she said. And nature, she said, is "dark and cruel, like Job or the Odyssey."
Ms. Dillard is still embarrassed by many of the imitators of "Pilgrim at Tinker Creek," who, she feels, sentimentalized nature, professed New Age philosophies and gushed confessional thoughts, but ignored the rigors of the serious naturalist.
Mrs. Buckles's book doesn't fall into that group. Whether she is writing about the copper beech trees planted on estates to be seen from vessels offshore, or why cormorants are maligned, the bedrock of research is evident. "I did a lot of homework," she said.
Mrs. Buckles also sees nature as filled with violence and passion. In one passage she describes how she watched, through a telescope, a great horned owl attacking another of its species over breeding rights: "The subdued animal lifted its head, and I could see that its left eye was pecked out. The dominant owl, whose face was bloody, threw up its tail again and gouged the victim with its beak. Whenever the weaker owl rallied, the conqueror inclined itself like this and delivered its triple whoo."
"Two extraordinary things happened then. After a silence the wounded bird gave a call entirely new and soothing. It was soft as a lullaby, almost like a musing. Simultaneously, the dominant owl brought me into the drama, intermittently swiveling its head and fixing me with huge yellow eyes. I kept my own eyes hidden, one behind the telescope and the other behind a mittened hand."
Yet, as fierce as they are, great horned owls are vulnerable to the indignity of being chased from tree to tree by mobs of raucous crows, which the author describes in deadly humorous detail.
To Mrs. Buckles, such details about plants and animals, most of them more benign than that owl, are fascinating. The shoreline environment examined closely reveals how complex life is along the margins of Long Island Sound, and the more she discovered, the more she felt compelled to write. "What I tried to do," she said, "is give the reader a sense of my excitement."

HEADLINE: FILM;
A Final Journey Into the Heart Of Cuba

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI

 BODY:
TOMAS GUTIERREZ ALEA was already ill with the cancer that would soon kill him when he made "Strawberry and Chocolate," the bittersweet comedy that in 1995 became the first Cuban film to go into general release in the United States and be nominated for an Oscar. So when the success of that movie led to other offers, he understood from the start that he had received a rare gift: a final opportunity to sum up a lifetime of work and ideas.
The result is "Guantanamera," which opens Friday and addresses, not surprisingly, the twin themes of love and death. Delineating the odyssey of a dead woman's body and the friends and relatives who accompany her coffin from one end of Cuba to the other, the movie manages to ridicule the rigid Stalinist bureaucracy that was one of Gutierrez Alea's favorite targets (though not to the extent desired by his exiled compatriots here) even as it exalts human attachments and passion. 
 "All of Titon's movies are a mixture of love, tenderness and acid humor," Mirtha Ibarra, the Cuban actress who is Gutierrez Alea's widow and appears in both "Guantanamera" and "Strawberry and Chocolate," said during an interview here, using the nickname for her husband by which he was known in Cuba. "But this one may be especially so because of the circumstances under which it was made."
Born into a well-to-do Havana family, Gutierrez Alea, who was 69 when he died last year, originally studied to be a lawyer. But the films of the Italian neo-realist movement captured his imagination, and he went to Italy in the early 1950's to learn about movie making. His international reputation was established by "Memories of Underdevelopment," which was released in 1968 and chronicles a bourgeois intellectual's difficulties in adapting to life in a revolutionary society. But within Cuba, he was probably best known for sly satires like "Death of a Bureaucrat," a 1966 work that foreshadows "Guantanamera" in both theme and style.
In fact, when "Guantanamera," which takes its title from the famous Cuban ballad and reworks the song's lyrics so that it comments on the plot, was shown in Havana in 1995, audiences flocked to theaters to see it, fearing that it would soon be withdrawn from circulation. They chuckled at the figure of Adolfo, a pompous bureaucrat whose every utterance is a stale cliche of revolutionary sacrifice taken straight from the pages of Granma, the official newspaper of the Cuban Communist Party, and roared at the misadventures that befall the corpse because of an absurd Government plan to make burials more efficient.
Working with Gutierrez Alea "was a privilege on both the professional and personal levels," Juan Carlos Tabio, who because of the director's illness became co-director of both "Strawberry and Chocolate" and "Guantanamera," said from his home in Havana. "He was the master of modern Cuban cinema, and part of what made him so was his flexibility and his spirit of criticism and self-criticism."
"We knew each other for more than 30 years and had a relationship that was profound but hard to explain," Mr. Tabio continued. "He worked with me in one way or another on every project I've ever done. It's not that Titon was able to find some sort of philosopher's stone that eluded the rest of us. But he had the strength to accept reality and tackle that reality in his work."
In fact, as bizarre as the plot of "Guantanamera" may seem, it was born, the director's widow said, of a newspaper story Gutierrez Alea clipped in the late 1980's, when Cuba's shortage of gasoline was becoming acute. To save fuel, Communist Party bureaucrats had actually devised a plan that would require coffins to be transferred from one vehicle to another any time the boundary of a province was crossed, in order that no province exceed its gasoline quota. To that idea, Gutierrez Alea added, as was his habit, observations from his own notebook and snatches of dialogue heard on the streets of Havana.
"When this movie came out in Europe, they thought it was a comedy of the absurd," Ms. Ibarra said. "But it's not. It is a comedy drawn from reality, an X-ray of the island of Cuba."
Indeed, anyone who has traveled the length of Cuba in recent years will quickly recognize scenes from daily life that Gutierrez Alea reproduces almost intact: the eerie absence of traffic on the highways; the families that wait for hours and hours for buses that never come, then crowd into the back of the rare passing truck; the flourishing illegal roadside commerce in meat and vegetables, which are bought and sold in American dollars, not Cuban pesos. "Guantanamera," in short, is a road movie that shows a society dispirited and in decay.
BUT MANY CUBAN DIRECTORS and screenwriters now in exile in the United States, including several who say they still regard Gutierrez Alea as a mentor or friend, argue that in "Guantanamera," as in his earlier movies, he compromises his principles and does not go far enough in showing the Cuban system's faults. Sergio Giral, who defected to the United States six years ago and has recently directed a documentary about the Cuban cinema called "The Broken Image," is one of them.
"Titon was a filmmaker and intellectual who sought in every way to use the means of expression at his disposal to question the system," Mr. Giral said in an interview here. "But he fell into a trap and was never really able to do any damage to that system, which is inhumane. In Cuba there are no films that really dispute the system, because the Government will never permit it. When something critical is released, it comes out too late and thus is no longer critical. It has lost its value, which is precisely why it is allowed to come out."
Jorge Ulla, a Cuban filmmaker who now lives in New York, also has mixed feelings about Gutierrez Alea. "To me, he is a tragic figure," said Mr. Ulla. "He was a great narrator and storyteller, a shrewd critic who created a vast body of work that shows a fine intelligence. But he couldn't, or wouldn't, talk about the real problem, which is intolerance. In the final analysis, this is a man who was torn between his Socialist convictions and his reservations about the figure of Fidel Castro. Once embarked on this revolutionary adventure, he was unable to break with it, and that limited his message and his work."
Politely but firmly, Ms. Ibarra refused to be drawn into any discussion of the political controversy surrounding her husband's work.
"I don't see why I should have to do that," she said. "If I were an actress from another country, you wouldn't even be asking me such questions." But she rejected outright the notion that Guiterrez Alea had ever softened his message or sacrificed his integrity as an artist in order to please the authorities.
"Titon was honest and always said what he wanted to say," she said. "He believed in many of the values of the revolution, and defended them. Besides, censorship is relative. In your country, the producer gets the final cut. That's censorship, too, and Titon never had to contend with that."
To Ms. Ibarra, "Guantanamera" is first and foremost an elegy, a work of art rather than a political statement. "This movie is a song in praise of life and love," she said. "That's what he wanted; he was very clear about that. He knew this was going to be his last movie, that death was there, within reach, waiting for him. So he wanted to deepen his sense of life, and speak out in favor of awakening and living one's life intensely."
"Guantanamera" reunites Ms. Ibarra with one of her fellow cast members in "Strawberry and Chocolate," Jorge Perugorria, who played the role of the homosexual Diego, who strikes up an unlikely friendship with a fervent Communist who is heterosexual. This time out, Mr. Perugorria is cast as Mariano, a macho, bearded truck driver who has a girlfriend at every stop along the road. Ms. Ibarra, in turn, exchanged her role as a conniving but earthy black marketeer for that of an economics professor trapped in an unhappy marriage.
"That was deliberate," Ms. Ibarra said. "After 'Strawberry and Chocolate' became a success and the Spanish came in as co-producers for 'Guantanamera,' one condition they set was that both of us, Jorge and me, be in the movie. So Titon said, 'Let's reverse the roles.' So we revised the script and revised the characters, which only enriched the story."
Gutierrez Alea left behind at least two scripts that Ms. Ibarra says are "ready to be filmed this instant." One is a Caribbean version of "The Tempest." The other, written with Mr. Tabio and a Cuban playwright, is called "Weekend in Bahia" and is essentially, said Mr. Tabio, "a dialogue for two characters, a Cuban woman who returns on a visit from the United States and the fiance left behind whom she re-encounters."
"Even before he became ill, Titon worried about time getting away from him, that there was not enough time at hand to accomplish everything he wanted to do," Ms. Ibarra said. "But those last five years were happy years, despite the cancer. They were rich, intense years in which he enjoyed everything. He painted and he listened to music. But it was the cinema he loved most of all and which fused all the artistic restlessness he had."

HEADLINE: A Music Mecca Loved but Reluctantly

BYLINE: By BERNARD HOLLAND 

 BODY:
IF ARCHITECTS HAVE VISIONS AND MUSICIANS have needs, why did so much go wrong in the building of Lincoln Center? Momentous decisions of design and financing attend the birth of any arts center, but they are eventually reducible to one: the needs of the arts versus the art of the possible. I suggest that the first has been sacrificed in the name of the second.
In so many ways, Lincoln Center, now immersed in the second season of its namesake summer festival, has been an enormous success over its 35 years of life. The location is central; the address is prestigious; the publicity flows endlessly. The surrounding neighborhood has flowered. The four main theaters have elbowed their way to the center of New York's, and thus the country's, musical life. Carnegie Hall may have the patina of tradition, but Lincoln Center has the television cameras. 
 Are Lincoln Center's tenants happy? Are their customers? Are the needs of both parties met? You may find adaptability and resignation, but true contentment? Rarely. In one way or another, the buildings have let their inhabitants down, but with little hope of significant change, we have gotten used to them. I wonder how many of us, in our heart of hearts, really like Lincoln Center, yet we go there anyway. It is where things happen.
The New York State Theater, the Metropolitan Opera House, Avery Fisher Hall and Alice Tully Hall (reading the map of Lincoln Center's musical buildings from south to north) emerged between 1962 and 1969. The real-life neighborhoods of "West Side Story" were swept aside to make room for them, and more than five million patrons drop in every year, buying tickets to operas, plays, dance programs, concerts and recitals.
The city owns the land; a nonprofit corporation, the buildings. Crassly put, Lincoln Center is New York's shopping mall for the performing arts. If you can't get into "Carmen" at the Met, Bruckner at the New York Philharmonic is a few hundred feet away.
Arnold Toynbee told us that civilizations thrive more readily in harsh climates than in ecological paradises. For the making of music, Lincoln Center has certainly challenged rather than welcomed. Artists struggle daily with bad decisions made years ago, and these struggles, waged against conditions now inscribed in stone, may actually represent the most gripping theater Lincoln Center has to offer.
Lincoln Center has 11 constituents -- dance, film, theater, libraries, schools -- but music is the topic here, so first of all, how do these theaters let us hear? Not terribly well, in most cases. Acousticians wax long-winded about the science of sound, but the brief history of Lincoln Center demonstrates the crapshoot that is acoustics. Why else have the State Theater and Fisher Hall (originally Philharmonic Hall) been continually tinkered with and on several major occasions completely overhauled? Repairmen dominate the acoustical trade today. Indeed, rejiggering the mistakes of colleagues is big business for firms, any one of which might consider Hindsight Inc. as an appropriate trade name.
Another subject to think about is fit. Are the various artists of Lincoln Center operating in the right places? Wynton Marsalis seems happy to be heading up Lincoln Center's jazz division, but he still hasn't found a hall in it where jazz really belongs. (A contemplated theatrical space across Broadway on 64th Street may be helpful.)
 
New York State Theater
For Emerging Voices, A Dilemma in a Paradox
 The State Theater gets in opera's way. A good place for dance, say those who know, it does not serve the New York City Opera well. Backstage areas are small for operatic purposes, the wings even more claustrophobic. While operating areas are cramped, the State Theater's towering audience space is the opposite, reducing any hope of intimacy. Putting on Broadway musicals as part of its season is one of the City Opera's brighter ideas in recent years, but these entertainments are lost in the State Theater. The need for significant amplification makes the productions seem artificial; the distances make them cold.
Acoustically, the State Theater is certainly better than it was: that is, after several significant makeovers in the last 15 years. Its stage floor was designed to muffle the sound of dancing feet. Over the years, that floor has done much the same for singing voices. The City Opera is caught in paradox: being an important way station for emerging American voices yet presenting an environment that can strain young techniques.
The devisers of Lincoln Center and of the City Opera never wanted each other in the first place. The New York City Ballet was desirable -- indeed, necessary -- to the center, but the City Opera's cut-rate fare would undermine competing activities of other constituents, all offered at higher prices. The City Opera feared the inevitable comparisons with its huge, international next-door neighbor and was right to do so. But it also knew that if it stayed at the City Center, the Met would create its own budget opera at the State Theater and squeeze the City Opera out of business. Accepting the City Opera made Lincoln Center's job of dealing with the city easier, so it did.
Moving this brave if helter-skelter company to a smaller, more opera-friendly house -- perhaps a Broadway theater -- has been talked about for years. Money is a problem. With little or no endowment of its own, the City Opera badly needs its yearly slice of the Lila Acheson and DeWitt Wallace Fund for Lincoln Center, which in recent years has averaged $3.4 million. Independence, a heady thought, makes board members understandably queasy, for the Wallace money would not go with them.
 
Met Opera House
Wanted: Singers Built Like Defensive Tackles
 A few yards to the northwest is the Metropolitan Opera House. Seating 3,800 patrons, the Met is the King Kong of opera houses. The new Opera de la Bastille in Paris, at 2,700 seats, is already vastly larger than the old Palais Garnier (1,900 seats); it seems small beside its New York colleague. Typical European houses -- Geneva (1,500 seats), Cologne (1,350 seats) or Stockholm (1,100 seats) -- are midgets in comparison. Many of the bel canto pieces regularly produced at the Met were conceived for Italian houses of 1,000 seats or less; one thinks of the Teatro del Giglio in Lucca, where a stage whisper is perfectly audible in the balcony's last row. The Met is twice too big for its own good, and that is not hyperbole.
Forget, for yet another while, a Mini-Met in that proposed new theater across the street. People inside the Met point to the high union and production costs for first-rate productions in a small house and shake their heads.
Given its intractable problems, size being one, the Met shows admirable resolve and intelligence. Acoustics that are relatively good, considering the gargantuan dimensions, help a lot. The Met has also developed the most sophisticated and smoothly operating backstage in the world. Foreign directors, who don't necessarily like the space, come here because things work. Under James Levine, the Met has built a pit orchestra of uncontested superiority.
But the Met can't make its stage any smaller; nor can it propagate intimacy in a setting that screams of bigness. It tries, and with intermittent luck: pushing sets closer to the edge of the stage ("Cosi Fan Tutte"), focusing the eye on central points ("Queen of Spades"), repeatedly framing smaller stages within the given one. Exploiting the Met's grandiosity can backfire, as it did this year in the distant, scattered setting for "Eugene Onegin." Franco Zeffirelli's bloated Puccini extravaganzas are huge audience successes, even if Puccini is lost among the towering columns and gold-leaf decor.
The Met's major artistic challenge is finding voices that can be heard in it. Some were always there, but a new generation of consistent heft and brilliance is beginning to arrive. Think of football: the 200-pound lineman of 30 years ago looks puny on the field today; a changing athletic world has bred athletes nearly twice his size. It may not be an exaggeration to suggest that the Met is nudging us toward a whole new operatic culture. Singing teachers, impresarios and agents around the world now scout big voices and discourage smaller ones. The Met is a major part of any international career, and every singer knows it.
With gain there is loss. Finer, smaller voices are lost to Met audiences. The heldentenor Siegfried Jerusalem, by all accounts a splendid Tristan at Bayreuth and Vienna, could not do it here. Newly arrived, on the other hand, is Ben Heppner, with a big tenor sound of quality, seemingly engineered with the Met in mind. Jane Eaglen will thrive in this house. Voices with presence, Deborah Voigt's or Karita Mattila's, will also succeed.
As these singers enter, another culture, nearly extinct already, exits. I remember seven years ago, at the Opera Theater of St. Louis, a young tenor named Stanford Olsen singing Donizetti exquisitely before a sold-out audience of 950 at the Loretto-Hilton Theater. Mr. Olsen's subsequent career at the Met has been less happy. Four times bigger, the New York house has not only smothered his singing but may have damaged his voice as well.
The Metropolitan Opera House's bigness signals American exuberance, but it also has to do with money. Surrounded in the world by subsidized opera houses, the Met has gone it virtually alone and done remarkably well. Seats must be sold, lots of them, every night.
 
Avery Fisher Hall
By Any Name, A Chronic Head Case
 The building just to the northeast of the Met is Lincoln Center's resident manic-depressive. Limping from disappointment to disappointment since it opened as Philharmonic Hall in 1962, the home of the New York Philharmonic finally had to be closed, excavated and rebuilt as Avery Fisher Hall in the mid-70's. Dull and dead-sounding in early life, it became garish and top-heavy.
Helping not at all was the Philharmonic's choice as music director for the 1980's. Zubin Mehta's relish of loudness and brilliance, often expressed in superficial terms, compounded the felony of Fisher's new acoustics while playing on the worst instincts of a virtuoso urban orchestra. Yet another revision five years ago, featuring new ceiling panels and tumorlike protrusions along both sides of the stage, has done much to bring Fisher's sound to an acceptable medium ground.
Yet none of the recent changes recognize that listeners hear with their eyes as well as their ears. Fisher gives off a glare, a brightness, an unpleasant impression of heat. Listeners and musicians feel its effects. The new appurtenances, helpful as they are, add more hideousness to what was already an antimusical atmosphere. Great performances overcome adversity, and they happen at Fisher Hall. The most recent to my knowledge was in the spring: the Verdi Requiem conducted by Sir Colin Davis, a remarkable evening.
 
Alice Tully Hall
To Be or Not To Be A Chamber Hall
 Across the street to the north is Alice Tully Hall. Hamlet-like, it never made up its mind. Lurking in Tully's design is an element of greed, a desire to have it both ways. For here a theater that claims to be a home for chamber music ends up seating almost 1,100 patrons, not the 400 or 600 one would await. The Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center is the titular resident here, but Tully's tall, fan-shaped space makes string quartet performances, not to mention duos, trios and quintets, too remote for comfort. Hearing a solo pianist from Tully's balcony, unless the artist has a truly extraordinary presence, is really no different from listening at the back of the much larger Carnegie and Fisher Halls.
Full orchestras can crowd themselves on stage at Tully, and the acoustical space handles them acceptably. But in the end, the hall is too big for the small and too small for the big. Its wood panels are not ugly. The seats are nicely spaced for leg room. Doors close silently. Gone, unfortunately, are the lobby's marvelous purple carpets, now replaced by play-it-safe green.
Some things work in Tully Hall: smaller orchestras like the New York Chamber Symphony, pianists like Garrick Ohlsson. Concert performances of smaller-scale operas come across well. The Lincoln Center vocal series, an excellent enterprise, features Met-size voices in recital, and they have been a good fit. But Lincoln Center has no truly appropriate chamber music hall. The Walter Reade Theater is the right size, but the dullness of the sound reflects its purpose as a place for movies, not music.
 
Juilliard Theater
The Little Auditorium That Could
 Is there a Lincoln Center hall that works as it should? One, but constituents will never get their hands on it. Buried in the bowels of the Juilliard School behind Tully Hall is the Juilliard Theater. It is a treasure, an oasis. The size, capacity 900, is sane for most of the opera repertory. The amphitheater design offers good sound and sight lines. It, like Carnegie Hall, is a place listeners feel good to be in.
Juilliard has fended off outsiders and kept it for school purposes, which are many. There is another problem: The Juilliard Theater does not employ union stagehands, and the other crews at Lincoln Center would not respond kindly to its use by the center at large.
WHAT TO DO? NOTHING, really. The buildings won't go away. They do big business. The tinkering will go on, and one hopes for the best. There are lessons for the future, perhaps, one being not to entrust artistic decisions to committees consisting primarily of lawyers and politicians. It also might be a good idea to find architects with a bolder, more selfish vision, people less ready to mollify the moneymen and city planners.
Somehow, America's best qualities, the ones that fuel our social, economic and political engines, never work with art. Killing the National Endowment for the Arts, for example, makes perfect sense to a lot of good people raised on American ideas of self-reliance and private enterprise. The isolated, inexperienced capitalist mind finds it hard indeed to fathom the ways art lives and works, so it is little wonder that lawmakers and businessmen remain bewildered if not hostile.
Artistic vision requires a certain totalitarianism. Consensus succeeds in much of America, but consensus in the arts produces Lincoln Centers. The Europeans have a lot of bad ideas about how to run a country, but they have a knack for finding the right person for a job and then letting the job be done. An example is the architect Frank Gehry, who has more or less had his way in the building of a new Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. A similar design, the Disney Concert Hall in Mr. Gehry's hometown, Los Angeles, remains a mighty struggle, pushed and pulled by politicians and money-raisers.
I doubt that many of us would trade our passports for Spanish ones, but at moments one feels a certain wistfulness. Then again, maybe Toynbee was right. Maybe all the things wrong with Lincoln Center are meant to test us, provoke us to listen harder, play better and sing like angels. Roll up your sleeves.

The Advantages of a 2-Family Start With Purchasing Power

BYLINE: By DIANA SHAMAN 

 BODY:
RECENTLY, Allen and Linda Sinowitz signed a contract on their first home, a two-family house under construction in Long Beach, where they are renting an apartment for $1,200 a month.
Mrs. Sinowitz's aunt, Marianne Veitt, a retired teacher, will move into the downstairs rental apartment and help with the mortgage payments, said Mr. Sinowitz, who works as a nursing-home administrator in Brooklyn. Mrs. Sinowitz is the director of social work at a local nursing home.
"We have two children and since we both work, this will also be a perfect opportunity for someone to be there for the kids when they get home from school," Mr. Sinowitz added. "So it works out well for both of us." 
 Whether for family reasons or for economic ones, many families are discovering the advantages of purchasing legal two-family houses. They are also discovering that few such opportunities are available, especially in Suffolk County.
In Nassau, the inventory of legal two-family dwellings consists mostly of older homes converted before zoning rules took effect. New construction, though permitted in some areas of the county, is limited because of restrictive zoning. And in Suffolk, two-family houses have only been built under pilot programs sponsored by nonprofit groups.
"There's a bias against two-family houses because of the inherent prejudice on Long Island against anything that seems to smack of New York City," said Jim Morgo, president of the Long Island Housing Partnership, a nonprofit housing group in Hauppauge.
Yet one of the Partnership's most successful projects was an enclave of eight two-family houses built in Bay Shore two years ago on land donated by the Town of Islip. The $116,500 price was made possible by a $50,000 New York State grant for each house. The houses were designed by Burton Behrandt Smith of Patchogue.
The rental income -- tenants have to be over 60 and rents are capped at 75 percent of fair-market rents in the area -- allowed buyers like Karen Commander, who is single, to qualify for a mortgage. She occupies the three-bedroom upper apartment, and rents out the one-bedroom lower unit for $750 a month.
"I never thought I'd be able to buy a house," said Ms. Commander, who works in the public relations department of a local hospital.
She had been paying $550 a month for a studio rental. Now she pays $1,200 monthly for her $110,500 mortgage, but the rental income brings the cost down to $450, plus utitilities.
"And besides, it's nice to know there is someone downstairs," Ms. Commander added.
Even in much higher price ranges two-family houses are "a very good housing option because you pay less for your own apartment than you would pay in rent," said Abraham Shokrian, one of the principles of Charman Construction of Long Beach, which is building the Sinowitzes' house.
The five houses still available that Charman has under construction in Long Beach are priced from $300,000 to $350,000 depending on lot size and location. Each has two three-bedroom, two-bath apartments and a one-car garage. Upper units, usually occupied by the homeowner, are 1,600 square feet in size. The lower, 1,300-square-foot units typically command rentals of $1,400.
If a buyer were to make a 20 percent down payment on a $330,000 house, the $2,700 monthly mortgage payment on the $264,000 mortgage, which would include $500 in taxes, would be partially offset by a rental income of $1,400, Mr. Shokrian pointed out. The $1,300 difference, he added, would be less than the homeowner would pay to rent a comparable apartment in the community. In addition, the homeowner benefits from tax deductions that include a depreciation allowance for the rental unit.
EDWARD MAYOURIAN of Old Westbury builds two-family houses in Glen Cove and Port Washington, communities that also permit two-family house construction in some sections. The problem is not demand, but finding land to build on, Mr. Mayourian said. Prices for his houses, which have two- or three-bedroom side-by-side apartments, range from from $275,000 to $370,000.
Prices for existing two-family houses in Williston Park, Mineola and Port Washington start at $220,000, but the rental income puts them within reach of first-time buyers, said Evelyn Atanas, owner of the Atanas Realty agency in Williston Park.
"It's a wonderful way to get a start in homeownership," she said. Mortgage payments, including taxes, on a $220,000 house typically average $1,800, but with one-bedroom apartments commanding rents of $900 and in strong demand, a buyer could cut monthly expenses in half, she noted.
"The rule of thumb is that $1,000 of rental income is enough to pay for $130,000 in mortgage debt based on an 8 percent interest rate," said Wayne McCann the owner of the Harmonious Homes brokerage in Sea Cliff, another area where older two-family houses are available.
PRICES for two-family houses in Sea Cliff generally start at $160,000 and go up to $250,000, Mr. McCann said. The rental market is extremely strong, he added, with only a 2 percent vacancy rate. Harmonious Homes also has a rental department -- the tenant pays the fee -- and runs credit checks on tenants for the homeowner.
Mr. McCann pointed out, however, that buying a two-family house means sacrificing some privacy and adapting to being a landlord. "It's not for everyone," he warned.
Nevertheless, Andrew Lapinksy, who with his wife, Lisa, purchased a 60-year-old former carriage house in Sea Cliff three years ago through Harmonious Homes, said they made the right decision.
They paid $183,000 for the property, putting down 10 percent. The downstairs one-bedroom apartment brings in an $850 monthly income, which reduces their monthly mortgage payment of $1,250 to $400. However, they are responsible for heating the house, which adds about $200 to their monthly cost.
Their own one-bedroom apartment, which has a finished attic, would rent for at least $1,000, said Mr. Lapinsky, who works as a sales representative for an oil company. "And here we can own our own house at a cost of only $400 plus utilities," he said.
Manor Haven, an incorporated village just south of Sands Point, is another area where two-family houses are available, said Dorothy Waxman, owner of the Sandsport real estate agency in Port Washington. The community has a private beach, a muncipal pool and tennis courts and is within the highly rated Port Washington School District.
The rental income allows buyers who might not be able to afford a single-family house in the village to buy a home there, Mrs. Waxman said.
Her current listings range in price from $220,000 for a 53-year-old house with two one-bedroom apartments to a 3-year-old dwelling with 2 side-by-side 3-bedroom apartments with dining rooms, priced at $439,000.
Mortgage interest rates for two-family houses are competitive with those of single-family homes, said Neil Krumper, vice president of Sterling National Mortgage in Great Neck,a mortgage broker.
When qualifying buyers for a mortgage, banks normally take 75 percent of rental income and add it to a buyer's income. Under the standard formula, a buyer can spend no more than 28 percent of income on housing costs, and no more than 33 percent of income on all monthly debt.
But the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), which purchases mortgages that banks originate, has a more liberal program for purchasers of two-family houses. To qualify for the program, Fannie Mae allows buyers to factor in 75 percent of their rental income in calculating their monthly mortgage outlay, thereby letting them fall within the 28 percent and 33 percent debt limits.
Down payments under the program can be as low as 5 percent, but the mortgage amount cannot exceed $274,550. Although there are no income restrictions, buyers who want to participate in the program must attend a counseling session, and must make at least $1,000 more in gross monthly income than their housing expenses.
A pamphlet, "Becoming a Landlord," is available by writing Fannie Mae at 3900 Wisconsin Avenue, NW, Washington, D.C. 20016- 2899. Information on counseling sessions is available by calling (800) 7-FANNIE.

New Uses for Old Sites in Clifton and Nutley

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
FOR decades they stood as familiar, and largely empty, landmarks along the stretches of Route 3 and the Garden State Parkway that run through Clifton and Nutley. Now plans are advancing to turn the commercial complexes, or their sites, to new uses, ranging from housing to retail and office space.
Most of the properties are in the Passaic County city of Clifton. There, the former Shulton Industries site, where men's soaps and toiletries once were produced, is being targeted for housing. The old ITT and Automatic Data Processing (ADP) sites are planned to become a retail/enterainment center. And the former research building used by the BASF Corporation, the chemical conglomerate, is being recycled into a Class A office structure. 
 In neighboring Nutley Township in Essex County, another ITT property is to become a town-house community. The site, now vacant, once housed the company's avionics and military and electronics division, including its 325-foot research tower.
In nearly all cases, developers are responding to rezoning of the industrially zoned parcels for new uses. They are also trying to take advantage of the state's improving economy -- 250,900 of the 262,200 jobs lost during the recession have been regained, figures from the Labor Department show. Well-positioned former manufacturing sites are considered candidates for re-use.
The Nutley and Clifton sites are rarities in northern New Jersey: large development sites near highways and job centers, including Manhattan, 15 minutes away.
But the re-use of such tracts poses a delicate balancing act for the towns as they seek ways to expand their tax bases while preserving quality of life of their residents. A main concern, within and across town boundaries, is that the new developments do not strain municipal services, particularly roads and schools.
In Clifton and Nutley the opportunity for redevelopment comes from the loss of industry, which has dominated the highways since they cut through those towns earlier this century.
For over the last decade companies like Shulton shut down and others like ITT, which split into three companies in 1995, reconfigured its space needs, providing the towns with space to redevelop for the first time in many years.
New Jersey, like the nation, has seen its manufacturing base erode. As of 1996 there were 610,600 manufacturing jobs in the state, down from 915,500 in 1979, according to data from the state's Department of Labor.
"We cannot wait for a single industrial user to fill the empty sites we have," said Mayor James Anzaldi of Clifton. "By rezoning them we took a pro-active stance that will serve the land with multi new uses."
City Manager Robert P. Hammer said the redevelopment also would help Clifton, which still has a substantial industrial base, to retain its position of having one of the lowest tax rates in the county. "We are exploring the options brought on by market trends and will select what is best for and has the least impact on the city," he said.
FOR the 205,000-square-foot former BASF site, at the intersection of Route 3 and Exit 153 of the Garden State Parkway, the answer is for Reckson Associates Realty Corporation to turn it into offices.
"The are no large blocks of space along Route 3 west of the Meadowlands or along the Parkway south of Paramus and north of Cranford," said Mark D. Schaevitz, senior vice president of the real estate investment trust, which is based in Melville, L.I.
Reckson is demolishing 25,000 square feet of the building for parking space. The remaining 180,000 square feet is being stripped to its skeleton and will be reclad with glass and aluminium. The new building, to be completed by next spring, will be leased to one tenant or could be divided into 10,000- to 15,000-square-foot blocks, said Mr. Schaevitz
The former 42-acre Shulton site, which has been closed since 1991 and is off Exit 154 of the Garden State Parkway, at Colfax Avenue, is expected to be sold soon and converted to housing. The seller is American Home Products, based in Madison, which acquired the site as part of its acquisition of American Cyanamid in 1995, and wants to "dispose of the property as quickly as possible," said Peter D. Blanchard. He is senior vice president of the Garibaldi Group, the Chatham-based real estate brokerage marketing the site for American Home Products, a manufacturer of pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.
The buyer, industry sources said, is Town and Country Developer, a division of Whiteweld, Barrister & Brown, a real estate investment company with offices in Woodcliff Lake and Manhattan. Town and Country is also advancing plans to redevelop the former ITT property in Nutley into housing. No one involved in the deal would comment.
The site is part of a 130-tract, which also includes the vacant Athena Steel property as well as a parcel occupied by Parkway Iron, that the city has rezoned for a mix of uses. The Shulton parcel is closest to existing neighborhoods, and as such works best as housing, said Mr. Blanchard.
He said the plan being advanced called for 800 for-sale town houses, of which 200 would be reserved for active adults age 55 and over. The sale is contingent on the plan's gaining approvals from the city's planning board.
Mr. Hammer said Clifton wanted a variety of houses, particularly those that will meet the needs of its older residents. That, in turn, will also temper the impact additional housing would have on city schools, he said.
ON July 10 the city approved plans to turn part of the old ITT and ADP sites along Route 3 into a 285,000-square-foot retail-entertainment center, comprising a 16-screen movie theater, a 70,000 square foot supermarket, 130,000 square feet of stores and two restaurants. The developer is Related Clifton Corporation, an affiliate of the Related Companies, a large Manhattan development company.
It bought the 62-acre ITT site and the 11-acre ADP parcel last year because "whatever the market, finding 73 acres this close to Manhattan is an irreplaceable opportunity," said James M. Jarosik, executive vice president at Related.
The complex, called Clifton Commons, is the initial phase of a larger mixed-use development that eventually will occupy the combined sites and include up to 750,000 square feet of hotel, office, housing and additional retail uses said Mr. Jarosik.
The first phase, scheduled for completion by next spring, will rise on 22 vacant westerly acres of the ITT site and the entire ADP site, which borders Nutley. Mr. Jarosik said the location supported the retail-entertainment concept because 236,000 people with an average household income of $55,000 live within three miles of it and the closest moviehouse is six miles away. The remaining 40 acres is home to a 950,000-square-foot building the avionics division of ITT Industries has leased back from Related until 2002.
Nutley has concerns about the project's first phase, mainly its density and its having an entrance off Kingsland Avenue. A second entrance from the avenue was recently eliminated, but Nutley residents are still worried that traffic from the project will spill onto their local streets.
Mayor Garry J. Furnari of Nutley called the project an example of overdevelopment. "They are trying to squeeze a gallon-sized project on a pint-size parcel of land," said Mr. Furnari, adding that his community would consider appealing the approval.
Meanwhile, Nutley, which rezoned the former 65-acre former ITT site within its borders for housing, is reviewing Town and Country's plan to build 582 town houses and 33 detached homes there. The company is under contract to buy the site contingent upon approvals, which Joseph L. DiBernardo, its senior vice president said he hoped to get next month.
Mr. DiBernardo said prices for the 1,400- to 1,800-square-foot town houses would be in the low $130,000's to $220,000 range. Construction is expected to start in September.

Pfizer Adding 100 Labs to Its Groton Complex

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

DATELINE: GROTON

 BODY:
JUST a few hundred feet from Pfizer's laboratories here, where scientists are carrying out delicate experiments, construction workers are blasting a three-acre hole into solid granite, removing 2,000 cubic yards of rock a day to make way for 550,000 square feet of new research space.
It is the latest round of expansion for the pharmaceutical company that has enjoyed phenomenal growth in southeastern Connecticut. Pfizer's Central Research Division, which is based here, will add 700 workers when the new, 100-laboratory building opens in 1999, bringing its total to 3,400. 
 Dr. Nicholas A. Saccomano, a vice president of Pfizer in charge of medicinal chemistry in the neuroscience section, said the new building would bring a variety of disciplines under one roof. The expectation is that by bringing them together, new perspectives and new discoveries will be generated.
"In some places people are still building separate chemistry and biology buildings," Dr. Saccomano said. "If you're going to build a car, are you going to have the people who put the front wheels on in one building, and the people who put the back wheels on in another? It wouldn't make sense. It's inefficient. This one building will house all the disciplines we need to turn ideas into products."
In a region that has been hard hit by cuts in military spending, Pfizer's expansion has been greeted warmly.
"I think we're the envy of every community in the country," said Bette J. Giesing, Groton's Mayor. "It's every community's dream to have this kind of campus-like setting generating a lot of good jobs and taxes and helping our community flourish."
Years ago, there were some complaints about the manufacturing part of the operation, across Eastern Point Road from the research site. But the company has invested millions of dollars in pollution-, noise- and odor-control equipment. The last time she received a complaint was two years ago, said Mayor Giesing. "Within two weeks they were changing their manufacturing process and the smells went away," she addded.
"That makes a real good neighbor," she said, "when they respond so quickly."
Pfizer executives have suggested the expansion might only be the start. Dr. John L. LaMattina, vice president for discovery, said that in 1988 Pfizer constructed a 260,000-square-foot laboratory that led to discoveries that are now moving into the trials in a new clinical building opened this year. Financial analysts have said Pfizer's pipeline of products awaiting final Food and Drug Administration approval is among the strongest in the industry.
"The decision was made that we need to discover more, to maintain our pipeline over the years to come," Dr. LaMattina said. "So we're building discovery space. And in a few years time, if we're as successful as I expect we will be, we will have to expand in the development and clinical areas. This is kind of like a tsunami -- it just keeps rolling along and picking up momentum."
Business leaders in the region have said Pfizer's decision to increase the size of its Groton research site sends a strong signal to other high-technology companies.
"It shows the state's business climate is starting to improve," said William D. Moore, president of the Southeastern Connecticut Chamber of Commerce. "They're good, high-paying jobs that Pfizer is bringing to the region, and other companies are going to take notice."
John C. Markowicz, the director of the Southeastern Area Regional Economic Development Corporation in New London, said Pfizer could prove to be a magnet for other, smaller drug companies that might be looking to collaborate with the pharmaceutical giant, or some vendors.
"One biotechnology company has just decided to move into the Norwich Industrial Park, and one of their primary customers is going to be Pfizer," Mr. Markowicz said. "That's a sign that it's already starting to happen."
Others expect an impact on the residential market as well. John P. Read, president of Atlantic Financial Services, a mortgage broker in Groton, said the expansion will mean an influx of well-educated, affluent consumers who he predicts will look for houses in the $200,000 and up price range, double the median house price in New London County.
"They're going to be buying better houses, they're going to be buying better cars, they're going to be spending more money in the local retail stores," Mr. Read said. "There's going to be a tremendous impact on the local economy."
Gary D. Smith, the developer of the 41-unit cluster development called Peppermint Ridge on 100 acres in nearby Old Lyme, said that about two-thirds of his buyers were Pfizer employees from previous expansions.
"Most of them are looking for an upscale community to live in, and Old Lyme fits that bill," Mr. Smith said. "In the past, a lot of them looked at Mystic and Stonington. But with the tourism expanding in that area, we're seeing more of the Pfizer people come this way."
THE new research building will be five levels, including two below ground, said Michael J. Mirabito, the senior project engineer. Visitors will enter into an atrium that looks up three stories into glass-walled laboratories. Conference space, coffee nooks, and other building amenities will be designed to get people from different labs to mingle. "We're going to get people out of their labs, talking with each other, and the hope is that it will foster quicker discoveries," Mr. Mirabito said.
He said one difficulty had been trying to shoehorn the building onto a 137-acre campus that is already crowded with more than 75 buildings. Because of the constraints the construction is going down two floors, into solid granite, and up three floors.
"Logistically, it's a very tight site," Mr. Mirabito said. "You've got roads, railroad tracks, the parking garage, and other buildings all around it -- there is no flexibility in any of the boundaries,"
And there are the problems singular to laboratory construction, he said, most of them a result of the air-flow requirements. Chemistry labs generally need a flow hood that can remove any harmful vapors.
"There's ductwork in there that you could drive a car through, that we need to deliver the volumes of air that we need," Mr. Mirabito said. All counter and floor surfaces must be durable to chemical spills, and easy to clean, he said. And labs require a lot of services -- compressed air, vacuum, nitrogen, a drainage system for chemical waste and a separate system for sanitary waste. "It's almost like building two buildings."
Dr. Saccomano said Pfizer was in the middle of an international expansion of research capacity, with projects under way in England and Japan. But the Groton expansion is by far the largest, and reflects the fact that most of the company's drug discoveries already come out of that site. "We know we've got a good engine -- why not run it a little bit faster?" Dr. Saccomano said.

HEADLINE: The Bronx Is Named an 'All-America' City

BYLINE: By F. ROMALL SMALLS 

DATELINE: THE BRONX

 BODY:
A RECENTLY restored 11-story limestone building here in this busy neighborhood, the Morrisania section of the South Bronx, stands prominently as a striking example of urban renewal in America.
And as a result of ambitious projects like this one, which is called Urban Horizons and is housed in the former Morrisania Hospital, the borough was named an "All-America City" by the National Civic League last month. 
 New York City's only mainland borough has for years been considered a prime example of urban blight. But within the last 10 years, community leaders, along with various government agencies and philanthropic groups, began the task of redeveloping the area.
To many Westchester County residents, the nearby Bronx has often seemed to be the converse image of the suburban prosperity.
The Bronx and Westchester were one community 300 years ago. But after the consolidation of New York City into five boroughs in 1898, the two communities have had a tacit affiliation.
Much of the isolation, negative perceptions and dilemmas that have scourged the Bronx for more than three decades, however, will become a distant memory if its recent national recognition and the desire of community groups and city officials are any indication.
Hy Frankel, chief of staff of the Bronx Borough President's Office said he had suggested that the Bronx apply for the National Civic League "All-America City" award because he felt that the story about the revitalization of the Bronx was largely untold. "Winning this award was an extremely significant moment as far as telling the story of the Bronx's resurrection," he said. "You don't think of the big cities and the Bronx as 'All-American.' New York City and the Federal Government had given up on the Bronx. But changes have occurred from the bottom up, and what a story about the human spirit to fight."
Mr. Frankel was part of the 15-member delegation representing the borough at the competition in Kansas City, Mo. He, along with community leaders and other officials, presented the record of development in the Bronx for the last 10 years.
There were 1,400 communities vying for the award and the field was narrowed to 30 finalists.
The "All-America City" award is based on a community's application and presentation, which includes questions relating to community challenges and concerns and citizen participation. Applicants were also responsible for corroborating the degree of success in realizing community goals, by describing in detail three recent community-driven projects that made a difference in the last three years.
The award is given to 10 cities each year, and each of the winners receives a $10,000 grant. This year's "All-America City" awards were underwritten by the Allstate Foundation. Bronx officials and civic leaders said that the urban renewal accomplishments in the borough represent a definite change, which illustrates the significance of grass-roots problem solving.
The three Bronx projects highlighted in the award-winning application were the Mid-Bronx Senior Citizen Council, one of many nonprofit community development corporations in the borough, which have worked at rebuilding the housing stock throughout the region; the Undercliff/Sedgwick Neighborhood Safety Service Council, which, with residents of this western area of the borough and city officials, worked to rid the community of blight and crime, and the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation, which has addressed the issues of women living in the Morrisania section of the Bronx by obtaining $23 million in state, Federal and private funds to create Urban Horizons, a collaborative effort to provide affordable housing, child care, health care and economic development.
"People are really stunned when they walk through our neighborhoods and they don't see the textbook definition of devastation," Fernando Ferrer, the Borough President, said.
Mr. Ferrer, who called the Civic League award the "Super Bowl for cities" is most proud of his administration's ability to forge partnerships with local community organizations to help solve problems in the borough.
"Our partnerships have got their hands around these vexing problems, that is amazing," he said. "All the people of the Federal Government claim they know the answers to urban problems. But we are carrying out these solutions right under their noses."
Mr. Ferrer also said that the Bronx has built or refurbished 30,000 housing units, carried out community-based policing that has contributed to a 25 percent reduction in crime and, with the aid of state and federally financed Economic Empowerment Zones, has attracted 522 new businesses to the area and increased construction in the borough by $2.6 billion.
Bernd Zimmermann, president of the Bronx Economic Development Corporation, said the "All-America City" award indicated that urban areas are regaining civic stature.
He said closer ties between suburban and urban communities are needed to compete in the world market. "We have to understand ourselves as an economic region competing with the world," Mr. Zimmermann said, adding that the isolation of inner cities adversely affects all of society.
To help develop a regional economic philosophy between the Bronx and Westchester, a joint transportation center, which will connect Bronx bus lines with the Metro-North Commuter Railroad in the South Bronx, is expected to be completed this summer.
For 48 years, the National Civic League, based in Denver, has awarded the "All-America City Award" to to cities and communities in recognition of their civic achievements and grass-roots approach to solving problems.
Michael F. McGrath, communication director of the National Civic League, said: "The Bronx is an example of a community 20 years ago that was an example of urban blight. What we look for in an 'All-America City' is not perfection. It is a city with a strong civic infrastructure where people do really creative things to address these challenges."

HEADLINE: Public Housing's New Design

BYLINE: By R.L. FELSON 

 BODY:
IT looks like a scene from a wealthy suburban school: children in after-school programs, designing their own Web pages, developing photographs in a darkroom, learning computer skills, taking drum lessons or working on creative writing or video projects. Some children are outdoors playing basketball or soccer or running laps as part of a track club.
But the scene is from a Hartford housing project, where some of the poorest residents in the city live, and Hartford Housing Authority officials say it represents just one dramatic change underway within the 4,500 units of public housing in Connecticut's capital. 
 Within three years, the agency intends to "dramatically improve the quality of life for every family within public housing," said the authority's executive director, John D. Wardlaw.
Most visible will be the renovation, reconfiguration or demolition of every unit in the city's dilapidated public housing, which is scattered in high-density projects throughout the city. According to Paul Capra, an assistant to Mr. Wardlaw, the number of public housing units in Hartford will be reduced in density by a third or a half. Demographics could also change as officials build new units and neighborhoods, requiring residents who return to be employed or in training for employment.
As demolition continues through the summer -- the first section of Charter Oak Terrace in the southwest part of Hartford was razed more than a year ago -- displaced residents are being relocated to market-rate private rental units under the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 8 subsidy program.
The dispersal of residents who for generations lived in housing projects is not only making the once-crowded housing complexes safer, authorities said, but is also having a ripple effect on neighborhoods and schools throughout Hartford and some of its suburbs as they adjust to their new neighbors, many of whom never lived in private housing before.
"It's a historical moment in the life of Hartford," Mr. Wardlaw said. "This is a test case, a laboratory. If we can make it work here, we can make it work around the country."
To date, 1,000 of the 4,500 families in public housing projects have moved into private units under the Section 8 program, in which landlords' rent is guaranteed by the Federal government.
Ninety percent of those residents are moved to housing within Hartford; the remaining 10 percent have moved to suburbs including West Hartford, East Hartford, Bloomfield, Manchester and New Britain.
The most dramatic project underway is at Charter Oak Terrace, where $41 million in Federal financing is being spent on what was once a haven for gangs and drug dealers.
From a peak of 1,000 units, the complex will be replaced with just 280 units by 2001, more than a three-quarters reduction. The first new homes, 50 in number, is scheduled for completion in December.
But Mr. Wardlaw said the reconstruction is more than one of bricks and wood. Unlike traditional housing projects that were islands unto themselves, the new development on 22.5 acres will blend into the adjoining neighborhood.
Existing neighborhood streets, for example, will be extended and joined to streets in the housing project, and the new single-family houses will be built on 6,000-square-foot lots, not unlike typical suburban developments.
The reconstruction also means the end of barracks-style buildings, which were originally put up as cheap housing for factory workers.
Besides rebuilding the community, the agency has embraced a economic development study by the Capitol Region Growth Council, and paid for by Aetna. The study calls for the creation of 500 jobs and a business park on 25 acres at Charter Oak now free of housing. The office and factory park would straddle the Hartford and West Hartford town lines.
"It's not just housing. It's jobs. It's education. It's everything a neighborhood should have," said Mr. Wardlaw.
Plans also include new training programs for children and their parents in what has been called "a campus of learners."
The program, run by a five-year-old New Haven-based mentoring program called Leadership in Education and Athletics in Partnership, or LEAP, aims to turn Charter Oak into a campus of self- sufficient, employable residents who may eventually own the homes they live in, one of the other goals of the public housing transformation.
An after-school program includes Web sites where students can post their work. They can use E-mail to communicate with their teachers about homework assignments.
"We're an additional support network in partnership with parents," said Mercedes Soto, who runs the program.
The Southern New England Telephone Company gave the city $15,000 to set up a system to access the Internet quickly and Trinity College has donated part of its Internet server to allow the Housing Authority to create its own Web site for the families who live in public housing.
Getting the children to feel comfortable with computers, Mr. Capra said, not only allows them to get what many suburban children are getting as a matter of course, but also will give them important skills they will need to enter the work force.
The Housing Authority has similarly ambitious plans at nearly all its other projects. One example is at Bellevue Square, a 309-unit complex in the North End of Hartford. With $15 million in Federal funds, it will be rebuilt and reduced in density to a 130-unit complex. Gone will be common entryways and common doors. Instead, each unit will have its own private entrance and a sense of private space.
Creating neighborhoods where residents are given a greater sense of privacy and responsibility, Housing Authority officials said, is seen as one tool to combat crime and drug abuse.
Mr. Wardlaw said many of the changes reflect the realization by officials that the public housing structure of the past no longer works. Twenty years ago, those in public housing may have been "poor in the pocketbook, but they were families," he said. "They didn't have the welfare system like today."
Over the years, as many families the very poor were left in increasing isolation, without a neighborhood to help them seek a way out.
Hartford's new public housing plan is meant to make sure it is not housing "for criminals . . . or ill-adjusted individuals," but housing "for poor people who need assistance and no longer want to be poor."

HEADLINE: Paying the V.A.T.

 BODY:

To the Editor: It was too bad that I did not read Betsy Wade's column "Getting V.A.T. Back, at a Price" (June 22) before a recent trip to Europe. But I have a warning to add.
A pitfall exists for those who are not leaving for the United States from the country where they made their purchase. The V.A.T. refund office will not process a refund request unless one shows a ticket for a direct flight out of the European Union. In my case, I was going from Vienna to London and then New York. My purchase at a Vienna stationery store was rejected at the Vienna airport. I was told to resubmit it at Heathrow, which I did. However the staff at Heathrow seemed at a loss. They finally handed me a pre-addressed envelope and told me to drop it into a designated box. Naturally, there was relatively little time, but I believe I followed their instructions. You guessed it: The form never arrived and the merchant has refused a refund. So I imagine that the economy of Austria will receive an added infusion of my funds. 
 My conclusion is that there are no bargains in Europe.

HEADLINE: Enlarging the Preservation Band

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP 

 BODY:
IN her three-year stewardship of New York City landmarks, Jennifer J. Raab has developed some untraditional ideas about who belongs to the preservation community. Like Bernard H. Mendik, chairman of the Real Estate Board of New York. And the ever-expanding Gap apparel empire.
"We've broadened the constituency of preservation," said Ms. Raab, who was named chairwoman of the Landmarks Preservation Commission in July 1994 by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "It's not about the battles any more." 
 The battles were fought against what preservationists saw as development plans that destroyed or compromised New York's heritage. While the commission was not exactly in their thrall, groups like the Municipal Art Society and even individuals like Margot Gayle, a champion of cast-iron architecture, had considerable access and influence.
Preservationists still have access. But Ms. Raab has made it plain that the days of Us vs. Them are over. "I don't see anyone as the enemy," she said. "Property owners are by nature potential preservationists. If they're going to invest in their buildings, they're going to make a tremendous contribution."
She believes that the preservation impulse is so widespread that it has exceeded the purview of traditional advocacy groups; that owners will gravitate toward restoration and renovation of historic properties if they are not unduly burdened by the government.
Her critics wonder whether Ms. Raab may be diluting the commission's authority -- and therefore the integrity of the city's landmarks and historic districts -- as she makes it into a "user-friendly" agency that is more of a partner in the economic development process.
They fear that the commission will become an instrument of city policy rather than a semi-autonomous deliberative body that can, if necessary, stand up to City Hall.
Overdue or overdone, the changes could probably have been made only by an outsider. And Ms. Raab was just that at the time of her appointment: a 38-year-old litigation associate at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison who had served as issues director in Mr. Giuliani's first mayoral campaign.
Although she once successfully defended a landmark designation on the Upper East Side from a legal challenge by its owner, Ms. Raab arrived at the landmarks commission with little experience in preservation.
She learned quickly. Between individual landmarks and historic districts, the 11-member commission regulates some 20,000 buildings, roughly 2.5 percent of all the properties in New York. It received nearly 6,000 work applications in the fiscal year that ended last month, an increase of more than 50 percent from 1990.
While other members work part-time without pay, the chairwoman receives $117,370 a year for a full-time job that includes heading an agency with 50 employees, a $2.7 million annual budget and its own landmark headquarters, the former First Precinct Police Station, an 86-year-old limestone palazzo at Old Slip and South Street.
"The commission has survived the awful budget-cutting that has gone on," said Anthony C. Wood, a private preservationist who worked for the agency in 1980 and has watched it closely ever since. "That is a real tribute to Jennifer Raab. Her good working relationship with the Mayor has been extremely helpful in keeping the commission an independent agency."
Not only has the commission survived but it has gained enforcement muscle, said Jack Taylor, a preservation advocate who frequently appears on items involving Gramercy Park, Union Square and Ladies' Mile. He said Ms. Raab had "come down very definitely on the subject of violations, far more than her predecessors."
Pushing to increase compliance with the landmarks law, Ms. Raab has created a new position in the agency, director of enforcement. She deals sharply with violators when they appear before the commission.
Perhaps her most important initiative is a bill that was introduced Tuesday in the City Council, at the Mayor's request, authorizing the commission to seek civil penalties, up to $5,000 a day, from owners or tenants who destroy or significantly alter the architectural features of a landmark.
Ms. Raab uses carrots as well as sticks. She gave a Preservation Achievement Award last year to Mr. Mendik for restoring the exquisite Art Deco lobby of the former General Electric Building, 570 Lexington Avenue, at 51st Street. She gave an award to the Gap Inc. for its "sensitive design" of stores in historic properties, particularly the Old Navy outlet in the Price Building on the Avenue of the Americas and 18th Street, in the Ladies' Mile Historic District.
"Why not recognize and reward that effort?" Ms. Raab asked. "Why not say to the Gap -- the 'big, bad corporation' -- that you're a preservationist?"
Under the preservationist rubric, Ms. Raab also includes neighborhood organizations like the Douglaston-Little Neck Historical Society and Jackson Heights Beautification Committee in Queens.
"There's an emphasis on community group input," said Vicki Match Suna, an architect and one of two commissioners remaining from the Dinkins administration. (The other is the Rev. Thomas F. Pike.)
Ms. Match Suna also noted a "cooperative spirit" on the commission, as did Pablo Vengoechea, an architect and city planner who was appointed vice chairman in February. "Opinions are formed almost by consensus as they go around the table," he said.
THIS is in sharp contrast to the contentiousness in which previous commissions were sometimes embroiled. Some preservationists worry that an emphasis on comity may come at the expense of rigorous give-and-take over esthetic and cultural issues. But those involved in hearings can now depend on the agenda proceeding at a steady clip and ending before dinner time, rather than dragging to midnight or beyond.
"Even her critics would agree that she's made a lot of progress in trying to expedite internal procedures," said Brendan Sexton, president of the Municipal Art Society.
The question in many minds, Mr. Sexton said, is whether Ms. Raab would choose development over preservation when push came to shove. That, critics say, seems to be happening at the Cottages, a modestly detailed but lushly landscaped two-story building on Third Avenue, between 77th and 78th Streets. It was developed by Robert Goelet in 1937 to designs by Edward Faile.
Above the ground-floor stores, which front on the avenue, is a row of eight one-bedroom apartments -- the Cottages -- which face a terraced courtyard and garden, hidden from view behind overhanging sycamore and apple trees. On this site, the developers Trevor Davis and Aby Rosen are planning to build a high-rise condominium.
A coalition called Save the Cottages and Gardens hopes to get the building designated as a landmark and counts among its supporters eight elected officials, the Municipal Art Society, the New York chapter of the American Institute of Architects and some 5,000 to 6,000 neighbors.
However, the Landmarks Commission has already declined four times to consider the Cottages for designation; once in 1988, twice in 1993 and most recently in May, based on its assessment of the property's architectural and historical qualities. That, as far as Ms. Raab is concerned, is that.
"I've made my decision on the Cottages," she said during a four-hour interview in her office on July 11. She noted that many of those who had written in favor of landmark designation spoke of the loss of light and air. "It's very important for people to understand that preservation is not a tool to stop development," Ms. Raab said.
Neighborhood opposition also confronted a plan by the American Museum of Natural History to raze the 62-year-old Hayden Planetarium, designed by Trowbridge & Livingston. It is to be replaced by the Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space. Permitting the demolition was not easy, Ms. Raab said, but "allowed what everybody considered a new landmark to be built." The new structure, designed by Polshek and Partners, is a glass cube enclosing a 90-foot sphere.
Though the current commission will rarely designate a property in the face of owner opposition, it has nonetheless kept busy under Ms. Raab. "Designations are coming fast and furious," said her immediate predecessor, Laurie Beckelman, now the vice president for external affairs of the World Monuments Fund, based in New York.
Under Ms. Raab, the commission has designated 57 exterior or interior landmarks, 20 of which apply to office towers in lower Manhattan, once considered off limits to the Landmarks Commission.
On Tuesday, the commission began a concerted look at potential Modernist landmarks, placing three buildings on its September agenda: both the exterior and the atrium lobby of the Ford Foundation headquarters, 320 East 42d Street, just now reaching its 30th year, a requisite for landmark status; the CBS Building, known as "Black Rock," 51 West 52d Street and the former Manufacturers Trust Company branch at 510 Fifth Avenue, at 43d Street.
In Ms. Raab's term, the commission has created four historic districts: part of Governors Island, Stone Street in lower Manhattan, Vinegar Hill in Brooklyn, Douglaston in Queens. It is expected to consider a Morningside Heights district and to expand the Mount Morris Park district in Harlem. It may also take a look at the possibility of a NoHo district in Manhattan.
"Areas are getting attention that did not in the past," said Eric William Allison, president of the Historic Districts Council, an advocacy group. "The downside is that in areas where there's opposition -- especially political opposition -- we get nothing."
Councilman Kenneth K. Fisher of Brooklyn, a Democrat who heads the landmarks subcommittee, said it might not be as much a philosophical stretch as it would first appear for a Republican administration to support wide-scale property regulation.
"There's a recognition on the part of the Giuliani administration that historic districts are an important tool for preserving a housing stock that's attractive to the middle class," Mr. Fisher said.
And Ms. Raab readily concedes that she seeks homeowners' cooperation. "Designation doesn't work if there's not local support for what we're doing," she said. "There's a science to preservation but the way it is applied needs to be discussed with the people who are affected by it."
Her interactions with applicants were on view at a public hearing July 1. The first major item was a proposal by the Brighton Heights Reformed Church in St. George, Staten Island, to build a new building on the site of its wooden Gothic Revival landmark, which burned down last year.
The new structure, designed by Diffendale & Kubec, is not a copy. For one thing, it would be built of brick. As Les Neuhalfen, one of the architects, explained, "They've had their experience with wood."
A landmarks commission of another day might have objected to a Fiberglas cornice or the mixture of Gothic and Colonial architectural details. But this commission seemed most impressed by the fact that the church chose to build a steeple again. "What was there before was a very important icon," said Mr. Vengoechea, who lives and works about six blocks away.
In less than 15 minutes, the commission unanimously approved the project. "All of us feel very proud of the church," Ms. Raab told the applicants, "and I'm really touched by the gesture of replicating the steeple."
THERE were no such kind words for the owners of an apartment building on Christopher Street, in the Greenwich Village Historic District. To keep loiterers off the stoop, they installed a gate without permission and were seeking retroactive legalization. Ms. Raab admonished them for their failure to obtain a permit and said the gate could remain only until they presented a more appropriate design.
She was even tougher with representatives of the Kmart Corporation who appeared with a proposal for new signage and shop windows at the underground entrance to the Astor Place Kmart. The entrance, from the west platform of the landmark Astor Place subway station, originally led to Wanamaker's department store.
Ms. Raab said angrily that Kmart had failed to carry out earlier work along the lines specified by the commission, having substituted metal panels for glass panels in the transoms over the doorway. "We were really extremely cooperative in getting you open for Christmas," she said. "Now we expect the same degree of cooperation."
Frank Gabeletto, project representative for Kmart, apologized for what he called a miscommunication. And a lawyer for the corporation, Caroline G. Harris of Stadtmauer Bailkin, assured the commission that the glass panels were being installed.
Later in the day, the commission wrestled with the future of Wildflower, the rambling Tudor-style mansion begun in 1924 for Arthur Hammerstein on the waterfront in Beechhurst, Queens. Long abandoned, it has suffered two devastating fires.
Kiska Developers has proposed to renovate the mansion as part of a 32-unit residential development on the site. Hammerstein's house would be turned into six separate dwellings. The project is designed by Faruk Yorgancioglu of Bridgehampton, L.I.
Mr. Yorgancioglu said he wanted to soften a roadway between the mansion and water by paving it with concrete blocks spaced widely enough for grass to grow between them. The problem, he said, was that the Fire Department insisted on an asphalt strip to bear the weight of fire trucks.
Ms. Raab volunteered to intervene on behalf of the unconventional paving. "I'll take it on myself to make a couple of phone calls," she said. Two weeks later, the Fire Department went along with the plan.
Running interference with other agency heads is a way to encourage owners, Ms. Raab believes. "I've now made it easier for an applicant to do preservation," she said. "I'm your partner."
Of that, she convinced Alan T. Kessler, president and chief executive of Commerical Developments International, a subsidiary of Kajima International. Until May, Kajima owned 55 Wall Street, the former Merchants Exchange and the National City Bank headquarters. Acting as asset manager, Commercial Developments tried to interest CompUSA or Barnes & Noble in the enormous former banking hall.
It was clear that the existing loading dock was inadequate. The owners told the commission they might have to demolish part of the five-foot-thick granite facade along Exchange Place to enlarge the opening.
"Ten years ago, if you went and said something like to them, they would have thrown you out," Mr. Kessler said. "I was shocked -- happily so -- to discover that their concerns at this point had become similar to our concerns, which was how do we get an obsolete building into the mainstream so it becomes economically viable and attracts tenants.
"I think they've become much more attuned to the needs of the business world," Mr. Kessler said, "and the fact that it's nice to own landmark structures but it's nice to make money, too."
Not long ago, the discussion of economics was anathema at the commission. While five-foot-thick granite walls are a rarity, the commission constantly faces applicants who want to know why they cannot replace wood windows with aluminum frames, or slate with asphalt shingles.
"I immediately reversed the policy that we're not allowed to consider cost," Ms. Raab said. "Our standard remains appropriateness. However, we are not precluded from finding a less burdensome approach appropriate. If you give someone the opportunity to present an argument as to why a new material will work as well as the replacement of old material in kind, we can all learn together."
Another change made under Ms. Raab gives the landmarks staff the discretion to approve a close but inexact restoration of certain architectural details when no archival photographic evidence exists, based on buildings of similar style and age. Cases like this would previously have come to the full commission for review.
"Are you losing the opportunity to find the just-right detail?" she said. "Maybe yes. But what you're gaining is that more people will invest in their historic properties because the process is friendlier and easier."
AS part of his development in the TriBeCa West Historic District, the restaurateur David Bouley planned to tear down a 153-year-old, four-story building at 161 Duane Street, whose floors did not align with an adjacent structure, 36 Hudson Street, which he is renovating. Ms. Raab said she would not support demolition but suggested the problem might be solved through an alteration of the facade. The result was a plan to add several courses of brick to No. 161. "Sometimes, in order to get buildings restored, you have to be creative," Ms Raab said.
Appealing as it may sound, this approach raises questions about the commission's rigor. "They are appropriately concerned with being user-friendly," Mr. Wood said. "But at some point, if you're playing a regulatory role, somebody's not going to be happy."
Like Mr. Sexton, Mr. Wood asked: "Does this commission really have a preservation backbone? The jury is still out. This commission has not faced that difficult test yet."
One test mentioned by several preservationists involves the plans for an apartment tower at 250 Water Street, in the South Street Seaport Historic District.
Another potential controversy involves a bill introduced earlier this month by Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver requiring that state and local laws do not "substantially burden the free exercise of religion without compelling justification."
The bill is modeled on the national Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which was used to challenge landmark regulations, among other laws, before it was declared unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court last month. Mr. Silver said his bill "is not a property-rights measure" but generally involved "personal rights to observe and practice religion."
Nevertheless, based on the way the Federal law was applied, Ms. Raab said she is "concerned about the potential impact it could have on historic preservation."
There is also likely to be a fight over the legislation in the City Council, which includes civil sanctions for the failure to keep a landmark in good repair, which Ms. Raab refers to as "demolition by neglect."
"We're not talking about removing a gargoyle," she said. "We're talking about the Biltmore Theater sitting there without a roof. We're talking about historic properties facing extinction." The abandoned landmark theater at 261 West 47th Street has been allowed by a series of owners to fall victim to vandals and the elements.
If the bill were passed, penalties for cases brought before an administrative tribunal would run up to $5,000 for the first offense and $250 a day for violations that continue after a respondent has been found liable or pled guilty. In the more unusual case brought before civil court, penalties can reach $5,000 a day.
But Ms. Raab emphasized that the goal was to improve compliance, not collect money. "I don't want $500," she said. "I want them to put up the right awning."
About her own future, Ms. Raab said, "I love this job and look forward to continuing in it." She said she would not play a role in Mr. Giuliani's re-election campaign because of time constraints, family commitments and the fact that her husband, Michael Goodwin, is the editorial page editor of The Daily News.
She is certain to stay in the spotlight as long as she is chairwoman of the commission. The panel gets a disproportionate share of press coverage compared to the planning commission and Board of Standards and Appeals, which arguably exercise greater influence over land use.
The commission has existed 35 years but was not given real power until 1965, after the demolition of Pennsylvania Station and the Brokaw Mansion at Fifth Avenue and 79th Street. Geoffrey Platt, an architect, was the first chairman. His nephew, Charles A. Platt, later served on the commission.
In its infancy, the commission picked its fights with care. It did not interfere with plans to raze the 19th-century Metropolitan Opera House at Broadway and 39th Street or the Singer Building on lower Broadway.
"They were terribly, overly conservative in their approach," Charles Platt recalled. "They were so worried about the vessel they were piloting through the channel, that there were so many rocks out there that could wreck it.
"The idea that the landmarks commission has been politicized under Jennifer is nonsense. The commission was politicized before it began."

HEADLINE: COPING;
In a 'Haven,' No Rap, Cola or Long Nails

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

 BODY:
"I BELIEVE in inoculating my students with both creationism and evolution," Trenton Hamidan, a seventh-grade science teacher, said last week. "Of course, my bias toward creationism comes out. But since both are philosophies that cannot be proved, there is a faith factor at work. Faith in creationism leads us to respect for God and to a frame of reference our children can fall back on when they are out of this haven and must make decisions."
Mr. Hamidan's "haven" is the Hanson Place Seventh-day Adventist School for kindergarten through eighth grade in Fort Greene. It began 33 years ago with 40 pupils in two rooms of the grand Hanson Place Seventh-day Adventist church, once Baptist. As more West Indians immigrated to Brooklyn, the church began buying properties. The school moved two blocks to a former coffin factory on Lafayette Avenue. 
 "This building says middle-class to me," said my friend and guide, Joel Millman, gesturing up at the concrete box. "This says we will build something for ourselves and our kids. Most people write about immigration as melting pot versus mosaic. I see it as a market. Instead of saving up to flee the city, we stay to invest in our own community."
Such investments have revitalized many neighborhoods, as Mr. Millman points out in his important new book, "The Other Americans: How Immigrants Renew Our Country, Our Economy and Our Values" (Viking). His title is his take on the controversial subject. But by digging in and creating communities, groups have also created ethnic and religious islands in the city. At Hanson Place, this is considered an advantage, especially for black Caribbean children whose parents and teachers want them sheltered from a perceived American black culture of "dog eat dog" and of sex, drugs and rap.
"It is easier to live with rules," said Mr. Hamidan, a 44-year-old from Guyana, who said he dropped out of medical school in Mexico for financial reasons.
"Even when the hormones are raging and there is a lack of immediate reinforcement. For example, we teach that violence is not the answer, and we use the Bible. We interpret the word 'meek' by discussing the domesticated lion. This is a symbol of pride, not timidity. This is a lion who chooses not to use his strength. He has the courage to walk away. On these streets, what is the alternative?"
Boys wear blue blazers and ties, girls white blouses and green jumpers. Caps, earrings, long nails and makeup are not allowed. School lunches may not contain pork, shellfish or cola drinks. Junk food and "flesh food" (red meat and chicken) are discouraged. Tuition is $1,425 a year for Hanson Place church members, $1,855 for other Seventh-day Adventists, and $2,170 for those outside the faith. About half the 300 students are not Seventh-day Adventists.
School was out last week, although about 100 children were attending an all-day seven-week summer program that costs $450. The director of the program, Gloria Nelson, who came from Jamaica almost 40 years ago to attend Brooklyn College, paused in my tour to try to talk to a 5-year-old Pakistani boy, who did not speak English. He could seem to communicate -- in a private language -- only with a little Chinese boy and a Trinidadian. Ms. Nelson shrugged expressively, as if a case had been made, even for creationism. Isn't this the answer, she seemed to ask.
"When you go to public school it's a battle," said Edison McPherson, a 36-year-old science teacher from Tobago. "You mix with others who don't share your same beliefs and children want to be like everyone else. But if we have done our job here they will see that the dysfunctions of the society around them are the result of not following God-given principles."
There are 15 Seventh-day Adventist elementary and middle schools in the Northeast. The only high school is the 75-year-old Northeastern Academy in Inwood, which reports that 95 percent of its graduates go on to college. The middle schools also feed three Brooklyn high schools, Midwood and Clara Barton, which have strong health science programs, and East New York Transit Tech, which sends many graduates to the buses and subways.
The West Indian success in New York has a touchy side, which the teachers approached carefully. West Indians often display a certain contempt for "American blacks" and at Hanson Place the word "multiculturalism" often includes the rub between contemporary black immigrants and the descendants of Africans who were kidnapped.
"We remind our students," Mr. Hamidan said, "that we inherited a legacy. We were not part of the civil rights movement. We owe them something for their struggles. In developing our own self-esteem, we must walk that line close to arrogance. We need to understand and be tolerant."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: BEDFORD-STUYVESANT;
Right Place, Right Time: Neighborhood Advocate's Victory

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
The routine is familiar: politicians visit a blighted neighborhood, make speeches deploring poverty and promising change, and then vanish, leaving only dashed hopes.
Occasionally, however, such a visit creates a tangible, lasting legacy, as it did in Bedford-Stuyvesant. In 1966, New York's two Senators, Robert F. Kennedy and Jacob K. Javits, toured the neighborhood, talked to community residents and promised to help. 
 Their visit led to Bedford-Stuyvesant's designation as a Federal Model Cities demonstration project, which in turn brought new housing, businesses and community resources to the area. Their visit also led to the creation of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, the nation's first community development corporation, which marks its 30th anniversary this year.
But were it not for the willingness of Elsie Richardson, a community advocate, to open her mouth, the Senators' visit might have led simply to one more study of Bedford-Stuyvesant's problems. A study was exactly what Senator Kennedy proposed when he met with community leaders at the Bedford Avenue Y.M.C.A. at the end of his visit. Mrs. Richardson, chairwoman of the Urban Planning Committee of the Central Brooklyn Coordinating Council, who had accompanied the Senators on their rounds, rejected that proposal. "I said: 'No, no. No more surveys. We've been surveyed to death,' " she said in an interview last week.
Senator Kennedy agreed, and he soon had people at work, acting on plans that Ronald Shiffman of Pratt Institute and others had drawn up to revitalize the area.
But Mrs. Richardson has never just urged others to action. An entire wall of the house on Prospect Plaza where she has lived for 42 years is covered with plaques and certificates thanking her for community service, whether helping to bring the first black-owned McDonald's to the area or raising money for Medgar Evers College. "A lot of work, a lot of work," she said of the commendations.
Now 75, she is acting chairwoman of the Coordinating Council and secretary of her block association. Her phone rings constantly.
She said she was pleased by the improvements in Bedford-Stuyvesant, proudly pointing out housing projects and community centers.
But Mrs. Richardson also sees too many young people being sent to prison, too many babies bringing babies into the world, as she describes it, too many aimless youths without jobs on street corners. She worries about big stores squeezing out mom-and-pop shops, and a city that pours money into Times Square while stinting on social services for poor areas.
She is most disappointed, she said, by the absence of strong and vocal political leadership in her community. She recalled that when Senator Kennedy was alive, "There was such a fervor. Lots of people were going into politics, getting into office.
"Now people get into positions and feel so satisfied," she said, "that they move away from the man on the street." AMY WALDMAN

The Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation was born from the belief that government could revitalize inner cities. With Federal aid, the corporation built and restored houseing, made loans, developed community programs, promoted culture and otherwise wove itself deep into the community fabric. The corporation turned the block of Fulton Street between New York and Brooklyn Avenues into a linchpin of local economic and cultural life, with the Restoration Plaza mall and the billie Holiday Theater. A few of the other commercial and housing complexes it has developed are below.
 
The corporation is turning its effots to providing loans and equity to small businesses, which can provide both jobs and badly needed services. "We are not looking at trying to create Silicon Valley," said Roderick Mithell, the corporation's president. "We just want people to invest in homes and businesses here."

Strip Mall Is Next Step for an Area of Weeds and Thieves

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
Weeds grow by the bushel on the lot at the southeast corner of Fulton Street and Ralph Avenue, but for local consumers, there are slim pickings. Throughout the neighborhood, empty buildings adjoin empty lots; stores, in contrast, are sparse.
That may soon change. In September, developers are scheduled to break ground on the lot for Partnership Plaza, a 19,000-square-foot retail complex that is to include a Rite Aid drugstore and State Farm insurance office, as well as local businesses. Alan Bell, a partner in the Hudson Companies, the plaza's developer, said the strip mall will employ more than 100 local residents when it is finished in about a year. 
 The plaza is part of the Giuliani administration's attempt to revive once-healthy business corridors, many of which have been moribund since the blackout 20 years ago. The eastern portion of Fulton Street has already benefited from the Saratoga Square project, a public-private urban renewal effort to enable about 1,250 families to buy homes in a 28-acre area bounded by Atlantic Avenue and Bainbridge Street and Ralph and Rockaway Avenues.
Providing shops is the next step. The city, state and Federal governments are providing approximately 30 percent of the $3.3 million for Partnership Plaza in the form of loans, grants, land and tax abatements. The New York City Investment Fund, which was set up by local business executives to aid distressed areas, is providing $290,000 in equity.
"Retail is now hot for New York City," said Richard Roberts, Commissioner of the City Department of Housing Preservation and Development. "We'd like these neighborhoods to be part of that phenomenon."
Waiting for a bus at the corner of Fulton and Ralph, Veronica Clark, 36, who owns a local shipping company, said she has to travel to the western end of Fulton or to downtown Brooklyn for "just about everything." She and other residents said the most pressing need was for a supermarket -- the nearest one closed after a fire several months ago. By then the city was too far into negotiations with other prospective tenants to change plans. But Kathryn Wylde, president of the Investment Fund, said officials hoped to attract a supermarket to the corner of Fulton Street and Saratoga Avenue.
Still, residents were hopeful that the new development would bring not just goods and services, but greater safety too. Louis S. Scarborough, 69, who has lived in eastern Bedford-Stuyvesant for 33 years, said thieves had been so emboldened by the general desolation that they had even stolen his phone cables. "I've seen the neighborhood die," Mr. Scarborough said. "I hope to see it revive." AMY WALDMAN

HEADLINE: MUTUAL FUNDS;
Despite Consolidations, There's Room for Many Funds

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
BIG institutions with big money are doing a lot of talking about getting into the mutual fund business. Among the recent spate of splashy, headline-grabbing deals was last month's agreement by the Zurich Group, Switzerland's biggest insurance company, to purchase Scudder, Stevens & Clark, the old-line fund management company. Other deals are also in the works, as big banks like J. P. Morgan negotiate to buy stakes in fund companies like American Century Investments of Kansas City, Mo.
Nevertheless, the pace of consolidation in the mutual fund business is about the same as it was last year, industry analysts say. And despite the stock market's sharp rise in the last 12 months, the prices being paid for firms are only marginally higher than in 1996. 
 So while economies of scale suggest that big companies operating in a wide variety of markets will dominate the fund business, widely publicized predictions that small firms will wither have not yet been borne out.
In fact, it appears that there is room in the fund industry for several different kinds of companies, according to Putnam, Lovell & Thornton, an investment bank that specializes in the asset management business. "A multi-tiered industry organization is evolving," the firm's analysts wrote recently in a research report, "in which asset flows and growth dynamics sustain organizations with wholly different strategies."
And that may be good news for fund investors who value the innovative management and hot performance associated with small companies over the marketing muscle and shareholder services big companies can provide.
In the first six months of this year, 23 money management firms that together managed more than $316 billion were bought, mostly by large financial institutions. Excluding Scudder -- which alone manages about $120 billion and is being acquired in a deal valued at $1.67 billion -- this year's activity is very similar to last year's, when 22 deals involving just over $200 billion in assets were announced in the first six months.
"The upward trend has not been very dramatic," said Neal M. Epstein, Putnam Lovell's director of research. "Rather, it is high and constant."
There is no single motive for the deals this year, analysts said. Some buyers are looking for new ways to sell their funds; some "are making a strategic acquisition or seeking to expand their basic product mix," said Geoff H. Bobroff, a mutual fund industry consultant based in East Greenwich, R.I.
"A lot of sellers have reached the age where they are looking for liquidity," he added, referring to the founders of companies who are interested in retiring or are planning their estates.
In general, fund companies are no more valuable this year than last year, based on the prices they are fetching, with one exception. "Prices have escalated for recognizable properties," said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services and a longtime analyst of the fund industry.
Consider the deal announced last Tuesday, when the John Nuveen Company said it had agreed to buy Rittenhouse Financial Services for $145 million in cash -- about three times as much as Rittenhouse was offered just two years ago by Corestates Financial, in a deal that ultimately fell through.
Of course, the amount of assets Rittenhouse manages has more than doubled in that time, to $9 billion from about $4 billion, noted Burton Greenwald, who runs a consulting firm in Philadelphia.
Analysts were reluctant to predict which firms might be the next takeover candidates. But Mr. Bobroff said rumors continued to swirl around Neuberger & Berman Management of New York and Columbia Funds Management of Portland, Ore., two private firms.
EVEN though the fund industry has been in something of a consolidation phase for five or six years, the 30 largest firms in the business have only a smidgen more of the overall market than they did in 1991: 72.1 percent at the end of March, versus 71.8 percent at the end of 1991, Mr. Bobroff said. A number of fund managers, meanwhile, "came out of nowhere" and grabbed important shares of the fund market, according to Putnam Lovell. The investment bank identified 10 firms that, from 1991 to 1996, saw assets under management grow at a compound annual rate of more than 40 percent and now manage at least $5 billion apiece. They include Warburg, Pincus; Janus Capital, and Pilgrim Baxter, all of which prospered through strong fund performance.
"Even as firms merge, there are lots of managers and investment professionals going off on their own and forming new firms, which blurs the consolidation trend," said Kathryn Steele, a research analyst at Investment Counseling Inc., a consultant in West Conshohocken, Pa. In 1989, 450 firms had more than $1 billion in assets under management, Ms. Steele said; by last year, that number had more than doubled, to 960.
Much of that growth must be attributed to the bull market, which has experienced few missteps in the last decade and which has helped increase the assets of even less-than-stellar fund companies. Some of those firms may be wiped out in a prolonged market downturn, analysts note, leaving the biggest and strongest as survivors.
Even if the stock market tumbles, big American and European institutions will remain interested in buying fund managers.
"There is no question you will see new deals, and I don't think demand will change if the Dow Jones is at 8,000 or at 6,000," said Mr. Epstein of Putnam, Lovell. "People see market opportunities developing and competitors getting into position, and are faced with the choice of either building the business or buying it before they have lost the race."

Are These Seats in a Club or on the Exchange?

BYLINE: By DAVIDSON GOLDIN 

DATELINE: SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y.

 BODY:
MOST Saturday nights, Matt Handler and seven friends from his summer house reserve a table adjoining the buzzing dance floor at Jet East, the newest place to see and be seen in the Hamptons.
Mr. Handler, who is 27 and a natural-gas broker, thinks it's a nifty idea. "You go on the dance floor, come back and the alcohol is still sitting there waiting for you," he said. But here in the region's toniest resort area, that table has a price: with tax and tip, Mr. Handler's party coughs up $1,000 on their Saturday night jaunts. 
 With a booming Wall Street just 100 miles away, many young clubgoers don't seem to blink at the latest extreme in a place known for extremes.
This summer, popular nightclubs in Southampton, the heart of East End night life, have added lounge areas -- complete with banquettes and tables and seats in the form of king-size beds -- to spaces otherwise stingy with places to rest your pups. But the tables come with a pricey minimum charge, which covers equally pricey libations sold only by the bottle.
Charges vary, depending on the night and the number of people in a party. For example, at Jet East, which opened this season, two people would pay a $300 minimum; a table for eight carries an $800 minimum.
The Tavern, another popular late-night spot in Southampton that introduced a lounge area this year, charges $500 for a table for two or more, and M80 wants $200 for the first four people (add $200 for the next one to four).
"Truly, I never thought it would get like this out here," said Terrence Cassidy, 52, the chairman of National Wireless, a communications company, who was a guest of friends in the Tavern's privileged perch. He shook his head, scanning the 20- and 30-something crowd.
Club owners are well aware that they have the economy to thank for what has turned into a booming business of their own.
"People are making more money and feeling better than the last couple of years, and they're going out and spending more money," said Gordon Von Brock, an owner of the Tavern.
"As opposed to a traditional cocktail-waitress bar, we make it feel like your own living room," he added.
And the club owners say it was just a matter a time before bottle-only service made its way from Manhattan to the beach.
The concept of serving full bottles of liquor instead of individual cocktails originated some 20 years ago in St.-Tropez and quickly spread to other European resorts, including Cannes and Ibiza. City and beach club owners say that the idea was popularized in New York City with the opening of the midtown club Au Bar in 1987 and spread to the South Beach section of Miami Beach. Then last fall, several new Manhattan clubs, including Jet Lounge, Chaos and Cheetah, began offering bottle service at tables.
But unlike the beach, most Manhattan clubs don't have minimum charges based on the number of people at a table; instead, they require each table to order at least one bottle, whether for 2 or 12.
With bottles at the Southampton clubs costing from about $200 for a basic vodka or gin to $600 for a high-end Scotch or Cognac, it is not hard to reach minimum charges. On a recent Saturday night at Jet East, the popular combination seemed to be a $250 bottle of Ketel One vodka, which retails for $20, mixed with orange juice or cranberry juice. Mixers are complimentary.
For those not willing or able to buy a seat, the typical $20 cover charge provides access to the dance floor and standing room only at the bar. But there's a catch: clubgoers without table reservations -- or their names on a "guest list," showing they are known to the owners or promoters -- usually spend much of the night waiting outside on line.
"It's hard as hell to get into this place, so the minimums are definitely worth it," said Brian Abramson, 33, a Manhattan equity trader, who paid $125 on a Saturday night for his share of a table at Jet East. "Just look at all the girls."
But not everyone is comfortable with what it all represents.
"It's a little bizarre and excessive," said Shreve Hicks, 28, a Columbia Records employee on her first visit to Jet East. She could not imagine paying the table minimum.
"This is very Roman," she said.

High Cost Of Fun
 
Want to take a load off? Here are minimum table charges at some popular nightspots; prices can vary depending on the night.
 
AU BAR -- (41 East 58th Street, Manhattan): $60 a person.

HEADLINE: OFF THE RACK;
Sounding an Alarm From the Newsstand

BYLINE: By FRED BROCK 

 BODY:
THE dog days of summer should be a time for hammock-swinging and lemonade-sipping, but the gyrations of the stock market haven't exactly been cooperating in this idyll. And the August issues of personal-finance magazines aren't helping, either.
The theme of the month is that stocks are overvalued, risks are rising and now may be the time to take some profits and run because the market is headed for a correction in coming months. Money magazine cuts to the chase: "Sell Stock Now!" screams its cover headline in giant red letters -- advice we've heard from various quarters almost every time the Dow has hit a new high in the last year or so. And Fortune, on its July 21 cover, asks, "Time to Cash In Your Blue Chips?" 
 Of course, plenty of analysts say that history is no guide to this bull market and that the Dow Jones industrial average may climb to 10,000 and beyond. Maybe all this conflicting expertise helped drive Jonathan Steinberg's Individual Investor magazine to run a column on Crawford Perspectives, a monthly newsletter by Arch Crawford that uses astrology to predict the market. Mr. Crawford sees a 35 percent to 50 percent drop in the next 30 months.
And Smart Money could be onto something -- relief, maybe? -- in its so-called Real Life Index. Among other things, the index tracks the price of a month's supply of Prozac around the country, from $64.53 in Tucson, Ariz., to $74.69 in Philadelphia.
 
WHAT TO DO? Money's Michael Sivy says the long-term outlook for stocks remains good, but he contends that share prices have risen too fast since 1994. A result, he argues, is that today's stocks are overpriced by 15 to 20 percent. He recommends trimming stock holdings by 20 percent, to about 60 percent of a portfolio.
Mr. Sivy, who cites one investment strategist's prediction that the Dow will dip to 6,200 in a sharp correction lasting six months or so, also offers this advice:
* Don't expect blue-chip shares to hold up in a market slump.
* Consider selling growth stocks with price-earnings ratios above 22.
* Add to bond holdings if yields on long-term Treasury bonds bounce back above 7 percent.
* Bolster cash reserves to as much as 25 percent of your portfolio.
In his column, Frank Lalli, Money's managing editor, reminds readers that in 1994, his magazine urged readers to buy stock when the Dow stood near 3,700, and that those who followed the advice have fared well. Sell some stocks now, he advises, and have cash to invest when the market becomes the bargain it was three years ago.
"Whatever you do, don't just sit there," he says.
Mr. Sivy, in his separate monthly forecast, says that if you are buying stocks, he recommends shares of natural-resource companies because of rising population, economic growth and a long-term likelihood of revived inflation. His picks: Newmont Mining, Georgia-Pacific, Alcoa, Phelps Dodge and Exxon.
Fortune takes a tack similar to Money's and cites specific companies whose share prices it sees as overvalued for various reasons: Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, Philip Morris, Merck and Motorola.
 
SHORT-TERM PLAN Smart Money's cover article, by Ken Brown, a senior editor, examines ways to invest money you know you will need within three to five years. Buying individual stocks for such a short time is unwise, he argues, pointing to 1990, when the Dow plunged 21.2 percent in just 12 weeks.
If you are very safety-minded, Mr. Brown recommends sticking with tried-and-true certificates of deposit and zero-coupon Treasury bonds. If your risk tolerance is higher, he likes loan-participation funds, which invest in bank loans to companies with less-than-perfect credit; these funds have been yielding 6.8 percent to 8.5 percent. They pay bond-like yields, but their returns increase when rates rise. But first, you might want to research this option a bit. The writer points out that cashing out can be tricky because the bank loans the funds hold are illiquid, most funds charge an early exit fee and investors can usually sell only once a quarter. The article recommends two such funds: Van Kampen American Capital Prime Rate Income Trust and Eaton Vance Classic Senior Floating-Rate.
For those with even higher risk tolerances, stock and bond funds are next. Four are recommended: The Janus Fund, which has never lost money over any 36-month period in its history; T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation; AARP Growth and Income, and Invesco Industrial Income.
 
GOODBYE, PRIVACY Kiplinger's and Money have articles on threats to privacy posed by electronic data bases and other widely available sources of information. Kiplinger's concentrates on the danger that your Social Security number could fall into the wrong hands. Money looks at specific practices -- including workplace snooping and improper use of medical information -- that can prove especially harmful. The bottom line is that many people have less privacy than they think.
 
HOME ALONE Smart Money offers a good explanation of the circumstances under which you can deduct the costs of a home office. It also points out that the latest Republican tax plan would allow deductions for home offices that are used for essential business functions when no other suitable space is available. This is an effort to deal with a 1993 Supreme Court decision that a home office must pass a tough "principal place of business" test.
 
COMING BACK? Kiplinger's takes a look at the efforts of Fidelity Investments to regain its performance edge in the mutual fund industry. Mutual Funds magazine examines the competition between Fidelity and its main rival, the Vanguard Group.
 
BITS AND PIECES Worth, which had a combined July-August issue, has a special issue for August on investing in technology; it will go only to subscribers. . . . Smart Money rates 10 market gurus, with Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs winning the top spot.. . . . Kiplinger's reports that if you earn $50,000 a year in Chicago and want to duplicate your life style in New York, you'll need $96,382; in St. Louis you will need only $37,263.

HEADLINE: The Beltway Talks Back;
Wake Up, America: Apathy Can Be Dangerous

 BODY:
Unless the heat has warped our memory, it was only a couple of years ago that Americans were so mad at Washington there could have been a new Congressional election every month. Today, the cry of "throw the bums out" is seldom heard, and the people storming the ramparts of the Capitol are mostly the usual suspects looking to cut the usual deals.
John Huang had ties to a company with ties to the Chinese Government while raising millions of dollars for the Democrats? The loyalists whom Newt Gingrich had taken to his bosom tried to ace him out? What does any of this have to do with the price of a double-decaf iced mocha latte? 
 The reason for this complacency, according to the polls, is that most Americans believe the country as a whole and they themselves are better off than at any time since who knows when. But boredom with government is a threat to the people's long-term interests, including people who make a living saying things like "boredom with government is a threat to the people's long-term interests" -- the experts, pundits, gurus and others known collectively as the Beltway insiders.
A few leading commentators and others were asked to explain once again just why all good citizens must get serious. Here are their responses:
 
Ralph Nader is the author of "No Contest: Corporate Lawyers and the Perversion of Justice in America."
Strange, isn't it, that thousands of corporate lobbyists are actually excited about what is going on in Washington. For they are pushing legislation to limit or eliminate their liability for their corporate crime, fraud and abuse against citizens and investors whom they injure. These corporate interests use Orwellian language to call their bills "tort reform," "securities reform," "regulatory reform" and "banking reform."
Should these measures pass, you will pay more and have less recourse to justice, and health and safety standards will be weaker and less vigorously enforced.
On another front, more of your tax dollars will go to huge corporate welfare programs and giveaways ($70 billion worth of public airwaves to existing TV broadcasters, for instance) if people do not back the politicians -- both liberals and conservatives -- who are fighting in Congress to end these boondoggles.
Stay bored and government becomes more of an instrument of the rich and powerful against the rest of America. Get active with your fellow citizens and you might just see more government of, by and for the people.

Norman J. Ornstein is resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute.
Peace and prosperity: great developments for the country, but tough going for politicians and pundits. Good times mean complacency among voters; combine that feeling with the underlying cynicism about politics, and it is no wonder that, outside the Beltway, events in Washington are even less compelling than they were in the halcyon days of cold war tension and economic turmoil.
The benign neglect of Washington has been fed by a sense that President Clinton, Speaker Newt Gingrich and the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, have found ways to cut deals to make modest changes that steer the nation in the right direction.
Their ability to keep the process on track has been admirable, but it is plenty tenuous. The very lack of outside threat or internal crisis leaves a vacuum that has been filled by often vicious partisan bickering and ideological warfare that could, if unchecked, poison the atmosphere enough to make further compromise and action impossible.
"So what?" you ask. Times will not always be good. If we continue to make small but tangible progress in areas from Medicare reform to expanding free trade to campaign finance reform, we can prevent pain and dislocation down the road when we can least afford it.
 
David Gergen is editor at large of U.S. News & World Report.
People are so bored with Washington, says my friend Mark Shields, that they are turning off C-SPAN in favor of the Weather Channel. True enough, but there's much about our long-term future that needs attention.
Beyond the obvious lack of nerve in reforming Social Security and cleaning up campaign finance, we seem unable to figure out what can be done to rebuild American families. The past 40 years have witnessed the largest collapse of family life in recorded history -- and it won't be repaired with V-chips and $500 tax credits.
Meanwhile, much of Washington is also strangely silent on the disasters unfolding in public universities in California and Texas -- and soon to appear elsewhere -- as affirmative action is thrown out. Racial preferences are no longer sustainable politically, but a return to segregation would be even worse. Clearly, we need to pursue much stronger efforts at remediation in secondary school.
On a wholly different front, we are shortchanging one of our most vital long-term investments: basic scientific research. Federal spending has dropped four years in a row and is still heading down. To allow a continued deterioration would compromise prospects for our security, economy and quality of life.
 
Marian Wright Edelman is president of the Children's Defense Fund.
Congress and President Clinton have a historic opportunity to address a shameful and solvable problem shared by 10 million uninsured children, most of whom live with working parents. The House-Senate conference committee will soon decide whether to adopt a Senate plan to insure at least six million children with good benefits.
The Senate plan is partly financed by a 20-cent tobacco tax that would curb teen-age smoking and save hundreds of thousands of lives. The inferior House plan leaves the door open for special interests to raid the child health fund and gives no assurance that a single child will actually receive coverage.
Every American must speak out for our children's health so that special interests like Big Tobacco are not the only voices our lawmakers hear.
 
Lynne Cheney is former chairwoman of the National Endowment for the Humanities.
One reason that people outside the Beltway should care about what's going on there is that Washington can render state efforts moot. Consider "whole math" instruction, which has been making its way into schools for several years. The idea is that mathematics is a natural activity that students will invent procedures for if only they are given mathematically rich problems to solve.
Parents concerned that this idea will prove destructive are working to be sure that states require instruction in basic skills. They've made headway, but the Administration could reverse it. The national math test for eighth graders being planned for 1999 could easily overwhelm state efforts, and it is being shaped entirely by advocates of the "whole math" approach.
 
Arianna Huffington is chairwoman of the Center for Effective Compassion.
A very important piece of legislation -- the charitable tax credit -- is getting scant attention in Washington. The proposal would allow families to give up to $1,000 of what they owe in taxes to a poverty-fighting charity of their choice. Not only would it provide billions of dollars for effective grass-roots groups but it would also strengthen the frail bonds of community.
In the course of deciding what group to support, citizens would have the opportunity to become more involved in the lives of those in need. And the charitable tax credit would establish a hierarchy of charitable priorities at a time when both political parties have tragically neglected the crisis of poverty and violence in our inner cities.
 
Kevin Phillips is editor and publisher of American Political Report and author, most recently, of "Arrogant Capital."
For voters to ignore Washington's corruption hearings because Congress won't pass meaningful reform anyway is sagacity, not apathy.
Besides, Washington is never the nation's prime focus near the peak of a financial boom and stock market bubble -- not in the early 1890's, not in the late 1920's and not now. That's true even though money's corruption of politics often tops out close to other peaks of the money culture -- the record-setting Dow and the economists' announcement of the end of the business cycle. When (and if) the bubble pops, voters will get involved with a vengeance.
 
Michael Mandelbaum is the author of "NATO Expansion: A Bridge to the Nineteenth Century."
As Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic received invitations to enter NATO, and American officials assured Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania that they, too, could join, one feature of NATO expansion received less attention than it deserves: the price tag for Americans.
Upgrading the military establishments of the new members and sending Western troops to the territories of the three Baltic countries to protect them from their huge neighbor, Russia, could cost hundreds of billions of dollars. The new members cannot pay; the Western Europeans will not pay.
So Americans would foot the bill, requiring higher taxes, less social spending, abandoning a balanced budget, or all three. All Americans should care about that.
 
Zbigniew Brzezinski was national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter.
Three issues deserve public attention; each, if mismanaged, could affect every American's pocketbook and even cost American lives.
The first involves Europe. By widening NATO, we can reduce the chances of new intra-European conflicts. Otherwise, Americans could soon find themselves again engaged in European bloodshed.
The Middle East cries for more engagement by the United States in the stalemated Israeli-Palestinian peace process. Renewed conflict could quickly ignite a major energy crisis.
Last but not least, a more powerful China is emerging, while America's relationship with that awakening giant is in a state of drift. By portraying China already as our enemy, some commentators are engaging in a self-fulfulling prophesy.
In brief, ignorance is not bliss.
 
Vinnie Rosario is a bartender at The Capital Grille.
As the economy has heated up, Washington has seen a revival of 80's indulgence with a 50's retro twist, demonstrated by the unusual number of martinis, cigars and steaks being ordered at The Capital Grille when Congress is in session.
And over the hustle and bustle of bar interaction, the old jokes can be heard, like, "How many politicians does it take to screw in a light bulb?" The most timely response these days, though, is, "They'd immediately form a committee to determine the most effective way to meet the challenges of this great task."
What does all this mean for the rest of America? Hey, a bartender never reveals his secrets.

The World Resurrects Che

BYLINE: By TINA ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
Thirty years after his assassination in the Bolivian mountains, Ernesto (Che) Guevara has captured the public fancy in ways he never intended. At least three biographies and several movies about Che will come out this year. The silk-screen Che icon with beard and beret now hawks compact discs, beer, Swatch watches, skis, designer dresses and a host of other products not traditionally associated with international Communism. Scientists have now found his body, one of seven skeletons in a pit in Bolivia, and brought it to Cuba.
What would a Che alive today make of all this? He might not approve of the more crass commercialization of his name and image, but if the ideological migrations of his comrades are any indication, he would be firmly in the capitalist camp. Unlike his body, Che's politics remain entombed. Armed, leftist revolution is today found only in Cuba, and in a few violent but tiny bands in Colombia, Peru and now Mexico. 
 In Europe and the United States, Che's image owes its commercial appeal to the absence of political content. Yuppies who would never have worn a Che T-shirt when it could have been taken seriously now find Commie-kitsch hip and ironic. In Latin America, many still admire what they see as Che's idealism. While he was capable of great brutality, to them he was also uncorrupted by power, happier suffering in his disastrous attempts to foment revolution in the jungles of the Congo or Bolivia than as a bureaucrat in Havana.
But his politics are long gone. The old leftist revolutionaries are now closer to European-style capitalism than anything Che ever preached. Chileans reacted with amusement a few years ago when Carlos Ominami, Economy Minister of the democratic Government that came to power in 1990, proudly announced a record year of foreign investment. Foreign capital was Mr. Ominami's enemy when he was a guerrilla of the Leftist Revolutionary Movement two decades earlier. Chile's revolutionaries are now largely social democrats, as are the vast majority of Latin America's former guerrillas.
In Colombia, Venezuela, Guatemala and El Salvador, to name a few countries, guerrillas have come down from the mountains to found reformist political parties, some of which are now indistinguishable from the competition. The Sandinistas in Nicaragua ran in last year's elections on a free-market platform. In Argentina and Uruguay, survivors of guerrilla groups decimated by death squads now support social democratic political movements. All these groups advocate a version of what Jorge Casteneda, a Mexican political scientist, calls "Rhineland capitalism" -- the welfare state, strong unions and high tax burden of Germany today.
The guerrillas have been transformed by time. Middle-class kids are revolutionaries at 20. Middle-class men of 50 are anything but. There is no new generation to succeed them because Latin America, too, has changed. The military dictatorships most of the guerrillas battled gave way to nominal democracy in the 1980's. Even before the Soviet Union collapsed, depriving the armed left of weapons, cash and ideological backing, revolution had proved unsustainable except through the intense repression of Cuba, a model that gave many leftists pause. Since the 1960's, both left and right in Latin America have converged on the goal of what revolutionaries once scornfully derided as bourgeois democracy.
That goal is not yet within sight. While the left's solutions to Latin American poverty and injustice have changed, by many measures the problems are worse today than when Che died. Although the poor form a smaller percentage of the population of Latin America than they did, there are 50 million more Latins living in poverty now than in 1965. The Mexican minimum wage, earned by 17 million people, buys a quarter of what it bought 20 years ago. All that Western Europeans enjoy -- like a living wage, the rule of law, access to justice, schools and hospitals -- seems as fantastical to most Latins as any revolution Che Guevara ever dreamed up.

The Angels Are Proving to Be More Than the Sum of Their Stats

BYLINE: By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
If anyone had suggested before the season began the possibility of a Freeway Series, the West Coast version of a Subway Series, most people would probably have wondered along which freeway the Los Angeles Dodgers would find an American League opponent.
Try I-5. 
 The Anaheim Angels live there, and they are threatening to reside in first place in the American League West, too. A 10-game winning streak, the league's longest this season, took them from six and a half games behind Seattle to half a game back entering the weekend. But don't insult Bill Bavasi, the general manager, by calling the Angels a "surprise."
"We get written up as a surprise, and I don't feel it's that surprising," Bavasi said. "It's a team we put together prior to spring training that we felt pretty good about. There are some good players in our clubhouse. We are where we are, and we don't have one guy having a career year."
Indeed, the Angels don't stand out in any phase of the game. They are fourth in hitting, seventh in pitching and eighth in fielding, and have barely any players among the leaders in hitting and pitching categories.
They do not frighten opposing pitchers with the threat of long balls (they are 10th in homers and slugging percentage), but they do give up a lot of long balls (their pitchers are third in most home runs allowed).
Mark McGwire and Tino Martinez each have more than twice as many home runs as the Angels' leading sluggers (Jim Edmonds and Tim Salmon with 16 each). Two of their starting pitchers have earned run averages above 5.00, and their leader in victories and e.r.a. is a rookie (Jason Dickson, 10-4, 3.26).
What do the Angels have? They have a team that can sustain long winning streaks (they won seven straight in May and six straight last month before this month), and long winning streaks have a way of catapulting teams into division races. "We're chasing the Mariners, so we have to take care of ourselves," Bavasi said. "We have to play as well as we can and put them in a position where they have to play their best."
The Angels do not have the glamour players the Mariners have -- Ken Griffey Jr., Alex Rodriguez and Randy Johnson. But Edmonds, their center fielder, has made himself almost a household name with his spectacular catches, and players such as Salmon, Garret Anderson, Jim Leyritz, Darin Erstad and Dave Hollins have played steadily and productively.
Eddie Murray, on the disabled list for more than five weeks with a wrist ailment, has not been missed, but that is because of Tony Phillips, the unpredictable but productive leadoff hitter and player of many positions. Phillips, who played for the Angels in 1995, returned in a May 18 trade with the Chicago White Sox and has done his usual good job of getting on base and hitting with some power.
The Angels also have overcome losses more critical than Murray's:
Troy Percival, the closer, missed six weeks early in the season with a shoulder problem; Mark Langston, their top starting pitcher, had elbow surgery in May; Mark Gubicza, another starter, has been on the disabled list since April 12 with a troublesome shoulder, and Randy Velarde, the second baseman, has been out all season following elbow surgery.
The most intriguing aspect of the Angels' current strategy is the decision of Manager Terry Collins to go with a four-man pitching rotation. Dickson; Allen Watson, the New York native; Chuck Finley, at 34 years old the senior member, and Dennis Springer, the knuckleballer, are in their third round of working as a four-man corps.
"We don't plan on going with it forever," Bavasi said. "We'll go with it as long as they feel good. We felt better with the bullpen we had than a fifth starter. We just felt we could go with four guys and figured it would make them more consistent."
Entering the weekend, the pitchers each had made one start with three days' rest, and the Angels had won all the games. When the Angels make up two rainouts with doubleheaders on a road trip that begins in New York on Tuesday night, Collins will insert Kevin Gross in one of the extra games and Matt Perisho in the other.
 
Parting With McGwire
 As the July 31 deadline for trading players without waivers approaches, the Oakland Athletics are faced with a dilemma unique even for these agonizing economic times. Going nowhere, they would like to trade Mark McGwire rather than lose him as a free agent after the season and get nothing for him. But how can they trade him, then watch him attack the home run record in another uniform?
"No club has talked to us, so no trade is imminent," said Bob Cohen, the agent for McGwire, who must approve any trade. "You hear all the rumblings, but you don't know how much is fact."
He said he has spoken to Sandy Alderson, the Athletics' president, and understands the team's dilemma. "Sandy hasn't said it directly," Cohen said, "but I sense they realize they have to trade him because he will be a free agent. But Sandy himself has said on numerous occasions it's a very difficult decision. He's almost in the ironic position that he wants to trade him but doesn't want him to do too well."
Widespread speculation has had the Angels as the leading contender to get McGwire, perhaps for Jim Edmonds, but the Angels don't look as if they are going to make a deal. The St. Louis Cardinals are another team often mentioned.
But Cohen said: "Mark wants to play for a contender in southern California. That's his first choice. And his second choice and his third choice. But does everybody get their first choice in life?"
The Athletics will not give him the kind of contract he can get as a free agent. But assuming they would pay him the going rate, Cohen said, raising the question himself, would McGwire re-sign with them?
"It's not a closed issue," the lawyer said. "But it does not appear likely."
 
Nieves Vvs. Gwynn
 Tony Gwynn, it is no secret, is the best hitter in baseball. But Gwynn, who is flirting with .400 this season, is hitting well below Melvin Nieves when they each hits the ball.
Nieves, a young outfielder with the Detroit Tigers, has struck out 113 times, the most in the majors and 100 more times than Gwynn. San Diego's perennial batting champion has been the toughest to strike out, only once every 28 at-bats (Nieves is striking out once every 2.35 at-bats).
But when they make contact, Gwynn is hitting .412, Nieves .454. Over all, Gwynn is hitting .395, Nieves .260.
 
Williams Cheers the Giants
 In his last seven seasons with the San Francisco Giants, Matt Williams suffered through five years with losing records and a season in which the team won 103 games but missed the playoffs. Now in his first season away, the Giants have been in first place for the past 10 weeks.
"I'm happy for Dusty and Rod and Barry and all the guys I played with," Williams said, mentioning the manager and a couple of former teammates. "It was tough on all of us the last couple of years, so it's nice to see them do well."
But doesn't he miss being there, being able to enjoy the winning and possibly the division championship? "No. We're in first place and playing well," he said of his new team, the Cleveland Indians.
When the trade was made last November, Williams was as stunned as Giants fans. "Unfortunately, sometimes you don't have any say in the matter," he said. "It took some time to get over wondering why, things like that. But it's baseball. You don't know what's going to happen the next day. I'm good with that."
The arrival of Williams and some other newcomers, notably David Justice and Marquis Grissom, represented a major change in the team that won the A.L. Central the past two seasons. The Indians' play on the field reflected that turnover.
Unlike the 1995-96 teams, these Indians struggled. They have been in first place for all but one day the past nine weeks, but only in the last couple of weeks have they begun exhibiting the ability to pull away.
The Indians gave Chicago every chance to stake their claim to the division lead, but the White Sox sputtered even more. When Albert Belle's new team finally put together a winning streak -- seven straight -- before and after the All-Star Game break, they gained only one game on the Indians, from three and a half to two and a half behind.
Then the White Sox lost four in a row leading to the weekend and tumbled five and a half back, only half a game from their largest deficit of the season.
"A lot of people expected them to be way out in front of us because they signed Belle," Hargrove said, "but I never agreed with that theory."

HEADLINE: Housing Drives Service Members to Poverty

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: TIJUANA, Mexico

 BODY:
On a recent morning, Casey Williams fell in with the tide as tens of thousands of Mexicans crossed the border here on their way to jobs in San Diego. He carried a green duffel bag, standard United States military issue, which advertised clear as the desert sky who he was: an American sailor on his daily commute to work from his home in Mexico.
There are no rules about where sailors can live. But the main reason Airman Williams, 26, a native of South Carolina, moved to Tijuana more than a year ago is something the Navy worries about: he thinks his employer, the Federal Government, does not pay him enough to allow him to live in the country he has vowed to serve and protect. 
 Many San Diego sailors who live in Mexico have ties there. Petty Officer 2d Class Cesar Deciga, 24, a son of Mexican immigrants, lives in Tijuana because it is inexpensive. As a result, he said, his life has become a curious circle.
"My family migrated to America to live the American dream," he said. "To have to come back and live over here -- I don't know. I never thought it would be like this."
In part, the situation faced by the San Diego sailors grew out of the surrounding geography and economy -- the proximity to Mexico, with its low cost of living, and the high real estate prices and falling apartment vacancy rates near the bases. But these sailors' lives also offer a glimpse into the wider question of how well service members live at many bases nationwide, especially in high-cost urban areas. Many military advocates in Congress and the Pentagon worry that economic survival has become harder for military personnel and that morale, and, therefore, the nation's overall fitness for war or defense, is hurt.
The strains are evident around the nation, especially in expensive areas like San Diego, Hawaii and Washington, where housing prices have outstripped military cost-of-living increases in the last several years. The Pentagon considers about two-thirds of the housing it administers around the country to be unacceptable because it is too small, too old or too rundown.
About 12,000 military personnel are on food stamps (more would qualify but wince at the idea of taking them). At many bases, service members live in rundown neighborhoods or trailer parks, sometimes in crowded squalor. Many take second jobs to keep their families afloat, and, in a few sad cases, marry people they do not love to get extra pay and benefits.
These problems afflict young enlisted personnel worst, particularly those with families, something the Pentagon does not encourage among its younger members. But it seems clear that those who serve in the military at all ranks and ages make sacrifices in things like pay, housing and time away from their families that the Pentagon calls "quality of life" issues.
For example, just after 5 A.M. one day earlier this month, at a mall parking lot in Temecula, Calif., four sleepy sailors, three of them with high rank, piled into a van for a drive more than an hour south to the North Island Naval Air Station in Coronado, outside San Diego. Chief Petty Officer Dave Whitefield had already commuted 30 miles to get to the van, for a daily round trip of 184 miles.
Behind the wheel, Master Chief Petty Officer Jack Napier, 42, who is at the Navy's highest enlisted rank, which pays more than $3,000 a month, said that commutes of an hour or longer were common among the sailors. He said he had been forced to move far away so he could buy a decent house.
"I'd rather be closer," he said, as the sun began to glow over the desert mountains. "I'd rather be asleep another 30 minutes than drive."
No one is certain how many sailors live in Mexico and cross the border each day to work at the mammoth San Diego Navy Base. The Navy itself has no idea. Guesses from officials and sailors living there run from several dozen to a few hundred.
Questions about the quality of life in the military have raged around Congress and the Pentagon for several years, especially since the cold war ended, the number of personnel was slashed, and more became expected of fewer people. Those concerns have spurred initiatives to improve housing and raise pay.
This year, at the Pentagon's request, Congress is debating a proposal to fix some of the worst deficiencies in off-base housing by providing allowances closer to what housing actually costs in various areas of the country. A Defense Department official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the proposal would allow people to live closer to their bases and in better conditions than they do now, particularly in high-cost areas.
But most efforts to address the problem have been piecemeal, as the military struggles to balance competing demands: saving money, upgrading expensive weapons programs and taking care of the troops. James A. Martin, a former Army colonel who is now an associate professor at Bryn Mawr College, said there was wide agreement in the Pentagon and in Congress that the quality of life in the military was at a low, but that the costs of large-scale improvements were prohibitive.
He contends, though, that the price of dismissing the issue is high: in the Persian Gulf war, he said, the soldiers with the greatest problems were families in bad housing or in some way unsettled.
"They were preoccupied with worrying about their families," said Mr. Martin, who is part of a group studying housing issues for the Pentagon. "If the buddy next to you -- who you may depend on for your life -- is preoccupied with things back home, you are at risk."
But as politicians debate what to do, members of the armed forces are finding their own solutions, like living in Mexico -- which, it turns out, can raise their standard of living considerably, even to include the trappings of luxury.
Petty Officer 2d Class Oscar Moreno, 22, grew up in Los Angeles but has lived in Tijuana the entire five years he has been in the Navy, which enables him to afford many extras. Mr. Moreno, now married and with a 3-year-old son, said that he would not want to move back to the United States.
"Here I'm upper middle class," he said on a recent night in his kitchen. In the United States, he said, his family would be "probably lower middle class -- low, low, low. It would change dramatically."
As if to underscore the point, he heard a knock on the door a few minutes later and let in a woman with her teen-age daughter. "This is the lady who cleans my house," said Mr. Moreno, who also has a gardener and a baby sitter and sends their son to private school in Tijuana so he can learn English.
Not all sailors who live in Mexico do so with such comforts, but a striking theme emerged in almost every interview: since the draft ended in 1973, the armed forces have become more a career choice than a patriotic obligation -- and it has become a career chosen often by people from low-income families trying to find economic security. Because of the high-priced areas around San Diego, sailors said, living in Mexico is a way to keep that tenuous grasp on the middle class.
"I could live up there, and I could afford it," said one sailor, a 37-year-old native of Wisconsin, speaking on the condition of anonymity, who pays $300 a month rent in Tijuana with his wife, a Mexican medical student.
"But then I couldn't afford to buy other things."
And because the military has become a career for more of its members, the percentage of service members who are married has risen -- to 61 percent today, compared with 42 percent in 1955 -- and that has created even greater financial strains, both for the Pentagon and the individual service members.
Even though the Navy takes no position on sailors' decisions to live in Mexico, it appears to be uneasy about the issue. Master Chief Petty Officer Keith Goosby, the senior enlisted sailor in San Diego, said that about three years ago the Navy began hearing that high rents were pushing sailors into Mexico.
He said an informal survey then -- and a second one last winter -- had ended with the conclusion that money was not the primary reason sailors based in San Diego moved south of the border. Most of those sailors, he said, had family ties, like a Mexican wife or fiancee.
Master Chief Goosby said he would like to talk to any sailor who thought he had to live in Mexico. "I want to know: what is it we're not doing?" he said. "If a sailor has to choose to live in Mexico because of the cost of living, it's a problem very embarrassing to us. You mean we can't do any better than that?"
Navy officials in San Diego -- where roughly 67,000 sailors are stationed -- have worked to ease the hardships. They have started programs to build military housing, to renovate old apartments and houses and to help sailors find affordable private housing.
But roughly 38,000 Navy families are eligible for 8,700 units of military housing, which are free but vary greatly in quality. The average wait for military housing is 18 months, though it can be as long as several years, said Capt. Jill R. Usher, who is in charge of Navy housing in the San Diego area.
Captain Usher said private housing that was comparable to military housing cost roughly $1,000 a month, which is above the housing allowances for even the highest ranking enlisted sailors. The average one- or two-bedroom apartment in San Diego costs about $700, above the means of many sailors, especially young ones with children or whose spouses do not work outside the home.
While it is possible to find affordable housing, Captain Usher said, "it's a challenge."
Petty Officer 3d Class John Seymour, 23, and his wife, Melissa, 22, looked at apartments in Tijuana as they considered ways to save money. But in the end, Mr. Seymour said, national pride got in the way.
"I'm not going to enlist myself in the military and live in TJ," he said, referring to Tijuana. "It's my country, and I'm going to stay in it."
Still, the Seymours said it was hard living in the $700-a-month, two-bedroom house they rent in Imperial Beach, a small city south of San Diego, where they had a drug dealer for a neighbor. Mr. Seymour brings home $1,500 a month, which also has to cover about $200 for utilities, $400 for two car payments and $200 for insurance.
In Mexico, sailors say, they pay around $160 a month for small apartments and $500 to $600 for entire houses, sometimes within blocks of the beach. Nearly all of them said money had been a factor in their decision to move to Mexico. For some -- like Mr. Deciga, the immigrants' son from Tamaulipas, across from Brownsville, Tex. -- it was the most important one. His two-bedroom apartment near downtown Tijuana costs $300 a month.
But Mr. Deciga gets tired of the commute, which requires him to wake up at 4:15 A.M. and sometimes takes two hours -- a long trip, but not an unusual one for sailors living in Mexico. His neighborhood, too, is not the safest.
"I love San Diego," he said. "It's one of the most beautiful cities in the country. But the cost of living -- I just can't afford to live there."

HEADLINE: About New York;
For Some Hispanic Immigrants, a Sense of Kinship With the Silent Laborers

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

 BODY:
THEY come from dust-blown villages and jam-packed cities, young men barely old enough to work up a decent lather on their wispy mustaches, all drawn by the lure of the American dollar. They blend into neighborhoods like Jackson Heights, where waves of Latin immigration have made the commercial strips look like an entrepreneurial outpost of the Organization of American States.
The siren song of opportunity is so loud that it resonates even in the bodies of those who cannot hear. Yesterday's discovery of 62 mostly deaf and mute Mexican immigrants who the police said were being held virtually captive in two Queens homes underscored for some young immigrants just how desperately some of their compatriots want to get ahead. 
 The police said the immigrants in the two homes earned their keep, and possibly paid off their passage, by selling key chains and pens on the subway and at airports. It is humbling work, long days of being shunned by commuters and pedestrians who sometimes wave them off with a dismissive glare. But it is work, even for los muditos, the mute ones.
"All Latin America is poor," said Juan Martinez, a 20-year-old from Puebla, Mexico, who lives down the block from one of the houses on 93d Street. "Mexicans and the other Latin Americans want to come here, any way they can, to make a little money and a little progress. Los muditos cannot talk. But they have hands and feet."
THEY are all gears in the hidden machinery of the city's service economy -- nameless delivery boys for delis, quiet caretakers at corner flower stands, faceless dishwashers in restaurants. They barely make an impression on the public, as long as they labor.
"You know, in this country, the immigrant sustains it," said Mr. Martinez, who sells fruits and vegetables from a van. "Whatever restaurant you go to in New York, you will find Latins working in it. You could not eat if they left."
In a city that has long been a magnet for Hispanic immigrants and migrants, the Mexicans began heading here in sizable numbers during the 1980's. They moved into blocks that already were home to Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Colombians and Ecuadoreans. Such are their numbers that in places like Spanish Harlem, the number of Mexican bakeries and taquerias rivals that of longstanding cuchifrito joints.
The mix is even more striking along 37th Avenue in Jackson Heights. A restaurant sign in bold yellow, blue and red -- the Colombian national colors -- faces its Mexican counterpart, where the awning is festooned with tiny banners for Tecate beer and a sign that announces, "Hoy, mariachis." Nearby, a phone-calling and money-transfer business -- a booming industry providing immigrant lifelines -- proudly displays the flags of Mexico and Colombia.
"Cocos!" shouted a coconut vendor outside a Dominican bodega. "From my corner to your refrigerator!"
The less welcome northern cold is a hard adjustment but a small concession for people like Mr. Martinez and his friend, Ruben Colmenares, both of whom paid coyotes -- smugglers -- to come to New York. Unlike cities in the Southwest, they said that la migra -- immigration authorities -- rarely bothered them here.
"In California, la migra is hard on you," Mr. Martinez said. "In this city, there's no problem because they let us work."
Mr. Colmenares, who makes deliveries for a midtown deli, agreed.
"For every 5,000 that are sent out of New York, 20,000 arrive each day," he said grandly.
"It's easy for us," Mr. Martinez said. "Even if la migra got me, I would be back here in a week."
MR. MARTINEZ said he paid a smuggler $1,200 to bring him here last year. Mr. Colmenares, who arrived five years ago, paid $650. In both cases, they paid half in Mexico and half here. They doubted that the immigrants discovered in the house on their block could have been still paying off their passage.
"Here, you pay the coyote first," Mr. Martinez said. "He would not bring you if not."
The real exploitation, the two men said, came at the hands of others who hired them in this city. In a way, they felt a certain kinship of silence with their less fortunate neighbors.
"In the delis and restaurants, they abuse us," said Mr. Martinez, who until last week worked 60 hours a week as a dishwasher in a restaurant for $130 in cash. "When I wanted to tell the owner something, it was either be quiet or go. Since I would have no money for food or rent, I stayed."
Why don't the police go after the business owners who paid low-ball wages, he asked. He looked across the street, to the house where los muditos had lived. A police officer on guard sat in a chair on the shaded stoop.
"He gets paid to sit," Mr. Martinez said. "I'd like a job like that."

HEADLINE: Mission to Mars Gives New Life to Space Program

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD 

 BODY:
After decades in which the space program drew more yawns than cheers, the heavens are suddenly alive with the tragicomedy of the Russian space station Mir and the triumph of Mars Pathfinder's roving exploration of the red planet.
Policy analysts say the burst of activity hints at things to come. The drama, they say, will continue or even rise in years ahead as astronauts take on risky new jobs and waves of low-cost robots explore other worlds. 
 The public has been largely apathetic about the space shuttle since the excitement of the early launchings and missions, which began 16 years ago. The shuttle's job of hauling payloads to orbit is often seen as dull.
In contrast, the emerging phase of the American space program is characterized by new promise and peril.
Dozens of probes are to head for comets and asteroids, moons and planets, deep space and beyond, analyzing the fabric of the heavens, searching for signs of extraterrestrial life and hunting for Earth-like worlds around distant stars.
Closer to home, astronauts are to build, service and repair an international space station the size of a football field -- an endeavor steeped in the danger of sudden death.
"There's going to be thrills, chills and spills," said John E. Pike, director of space policy at the Federation of American Scientists, a private group in Washington. "All this stuff is exciting in a way the space program hasn't been for a long time."
Dr. Louis D. Friedman, executive director of the Planetary Society, a group in Pasadena, Calif., that advocates space exploration, said the program was entering a vigorous new phase.
"We're coming out of a slump," he said in an interview. "The 1980's were dark and lost. They were dark because we sent back no images from other worlds, and lost because we forgot why we were in space. 'Routine access' was the mantra, when what people really wanted was to explore new worlds."
"There's a sense of real vitality now," Dr. Friedman added. "The excitement has returned for the first time in decades."
The pace of activity is to pick up in the years ahead for robots and astronauts alike, which is already creating a major challenge for people who are trying to keep track of the new undertakings.
"There are so many missions," said Donald Savage, a spokesman at the headquarters of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in Washington. "It's difficult to keep up."
Experts agree that the high point of the American space program occurred as men landed on the Moon in the late 1960's and as the first wave of deep planetary probes swept the solar system in the 1970's.
After that, the program became bogged down in increasingly costly programs and spectacular failures like the 1986 explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, which killed seven astronauts. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched into orbit in 1990, only to have scientists learn that its main mirror was distorted by a serious flaw that astronauts later repaired.
The new era of revitalization is partly attributed by analysts to the influence of Daniel S. Goldin, who became the NASA administrator in early 1992 and started a vigorous campaign to make the agency's projects smaller, cheaper, faster and better, as he put it. He is still pushing that agenda hard.
The other rejuvenating factor is President Clinton, who, after taking office in 1993, ordered NASA to abandon its long rivalry with Moscow and join its Russian counterparts in creating a new East-West program of piloted exploration of the heavens.
It was the first time that the White House had paid close attention to the space program since the Moon landings. Its political goals were to strengthen the shaky Russia economy and engage Moscow in constructive space work in exchange for ending practices like exporting advanced rocket gear to developing countries.
To date, five American astronauts have lived and worked aboard Russia's Mir outpost. The East-West collaboration is to culminate in the international space station, a 470-ton, 356-foot behemoth that is to hold as many as seven people studying heaven and Earth, and things like human physiology, while moving through space at more than 17,000 miles an hour.
The cascade of accidents that has shaken the 11-year-old Mir has raised questions about whether the station should be set aside in favor of the new one, which is viewed as safer. But many analysts say that logic is flawed, that the new outpost will have its own accidents and dangers, some of which could be major.
"All the things that have happened could happen in the future," said Jerry Grey, policy director of the American Institute of Astronautics and Aeronautics in Washington, a professional group of aerospace engineers. "If we planned the use of Mir in the most effective way, we would have had all these accidents. It's invaluable experience."
The new outpost is to be assembled in space by astronauts. Just sending all the parts and crews into orbit will require 42 launchings, which are to begin next year. Construction is to be finished in 2003.
"There will be a fair amount of excitement" as astronauts work as orbital builders and mechanics, said Dr. John M. Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University. He added that the drama would center on "fixing problems" and avoiding the risk of "killing people."
Danger is rooted in the size, which makes the station an easy target for speeding asteroids and space debris. In January, the National Academy of Sciences in Washington called on the station team to pay more attention to shielding the station and developing repair techniques.
Another risk is age. The station is designed for a life of 10 years and will cost some $50 billion to build and run. But given the expense, analysts say, its life will undoubtedly be extended to 20 or 30 years by astronauts' repairs.
So the aging patchwork that is Mir is likely to be repeated in the new outpost, only over a longer period.
"Mir has had two fires and one depressurization in 11 years," said George Cleghorn, a former aerospace executive who was chairman of the National Academy of Sciences panel on the outpost. "You can extrapolate that" to a higher number of tribulations over three decades for the new station, he said, adding that it could also be safer in many respects.
The robotic part of the American space program is also entering a new phase, which, in stark contrast to the costly station venture, involves large numbers of low-cost missions.
The new approach was on display at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., on July 4 as joyous controllers oversaw the first landing of an American craft on Mars in 21 years and the first exploration of any planet by an itinerant robot. The effort was success on a shoestring, costing less than one-tenth what the Viking landings did two decades ago.
Experts say a whirlwind of new missions is planned or already winging its way toward distant targets. The highlights include the Lunar Prospector, which is set for launching in September to orbit the Moon in search of minerals and ice deposits; Stardust, to be launched in February 1999 on a mission to catch part of a comet's tail and take it back to Earth, and the Planet Finder, a cluster of four infrared telescopes tentatively set for launching in 2005, that is to orbit beyond Jupiter while hunting for Earth-like planets around distant stars.
Not all the missions are very likely to have the same degree of public interest that has typified the Mars Pathfinder success, in which a plucky little robot is traversing and analyzing Martian soil and rocks.
"They'll be taking different forms of scientific measurements that will not always translate into arresting images," said Dr. Logsdon of George Washington University.
But the rising quantity and intensity of space exploration, experts say, is sure to expand greatly the opportunities for success and failure, giving the program new lift and drama.
"The space program is always fragile," said Dr. Friedman of the Planetary Society. "But all the things being accomplished now are a preview of things to come. They're setting a new standard, and that's good. We need high standards" in the exploration of new worlds.

Some highlights of the dozens of planned unmanned space exploration missions:
 
Lunar Prospector, set for launching in September, is to orbit the Moon in search of minerals and ice deposits.
 
Mars Global Surveyor is to reach the red planet in September, orbiting and analyzing it.
 
Mars Surveyor 1998 Orbiter is to be launched in December 1998.
 
Mars Surveyor 1998 Lander it to blast off in January 1999. During descent, the lander spacecraft is to drop a separate payload that deeply penetrates the Martian soil, investigating its makeup.
 
Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous is to reach the rocky asteroid Eros in February 1999, going into orbit for detailed analyses.
 
Stardust is to be launched in February 1999 on a mission to catch part of a comet's tail and bring it back to Earth.
 
The Comet Nucleus Tour, to be launched in 2002, is to investigate a trio of icy comets.
 
The Planet Finder, tentatively set for launching in 2005, is a cluster of four infrared telescopes that is to orbit out beyond Jupiter and hunt for Earth-like planets around distant stars.

HEADLINE: The July of Loren Easton;
Not All at Horace Mann Are From Upper East Side

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I read the article with interest since my own daughter graduated from high school this June. 
 Hannah began her education at P.S. 173 in Fresh Meadows, Queens (no aptitude test required, thank you). When we moved to Douglaston, she transferred to P.S. 98, entering a third-grade class with 34 children, a teacher-student ratio that I'm sure would horrify any Horace Mann parent or faculty member. Her middle school was M.S. 67, and in ninth grade she began her high school career at St. Francis Preparatory School.
Like so many parochial schools in our city, St. Francis has students from a wide range of economic, racial, ethnic and religious backgrounds. It gives its students an excellent education, yet I'm sure the good brothers and sisters and other dedicated faculty members of St. Francis would not be comfortable with the label "elite." Certainly no one would mistake the large brick building and surrounding parking lot for a small college campus. The tuition, less than $4,000, is bargain-basement, compared with the schools in your article.
Having then received this education that the privileged students of New York's 70 independent schools would no doubt find unremarkable, perhaps even inferior, what is my daughter to do with her future? Actually, she's going to Penn. See you there, Loren!

HEADLINE: Coup Halts Lifeline to Cambodia Poor

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KVET, Cambodia, July 19

 BODY:
It costs a full day's wages here $1.70 -- to take a motorcycle taxi through the rice fields to the marketplace seven miles away. Yet the people are so poor and isolated that social service groups say it is useless to offer them credit programs.
This tiny village, like thousands of others around the country, depends for its welfare on a wide range of international assistance that substitutes throughout Cambodia for Government services. The four-room schoolhouse was built with foreign aid. So was the narrow, rutted dirt road that links it to the outside world. 
 Health education and a literacy program, as well as information about AIDS, are provided by foreign aid groups. The village's economy now depends on an internationally financed "cow bank" that has lent 32 cows to the subsistence farmers here.
The village of Kvet, with its 520 people -- including 63 war widows -- is one of many examples of the success of a broad and idealistic program of international aid that is helping this broken country to begin to heal. It also offers a glimpse of the ways in which the withdrawal of aid -- now being discussed in the United States and other nations -- would affect the lives of the poor villagers who make up the overwhelming majority of Cambodians.
Ten days ago, after the violent seizure of power by Hun Sen, the Second Prime Minister, the United States suspended its aid programs to Cambodia for 30 days. These programs include $35 million in direct assistance as well as about $7 million in Defense Department money, most of it for the removal of land mines.
Other countries and organizations have also cut off aid or said they were considering similar moves. Japan suspended its program of about $150 million a year. The World Bank is considering whether to continue a $54.3 million program that includes $1.4 million for disease prevention and eradication and $20 million to improve agriculture. All told, the amount of foreign aid that has been coming in is equal to the national budget.
When its suspension ends on Aug. 9, the United States must decide whether, or to what extent, to resume its aid. The difficult decision faced by donors is how to punish or influence Mr. Hun Sen without hurting people like the villagers in Kvet.
"Teach a lesson to Hun Sen?" said Kien Serey Phal, who heads the Cambodian Women's Development Association, an aid group that uses money from the United States and other countries to help villagers. "But the poorest will suffer as a result of that lesson, not Hun Sen."
Few countries are as dependent on foreign assistance as Cambodia. From 1975 to 1979, more than a million people died when the radical Communist Government of the Khmer Rouge launched a campaign to kill the country's educated people and destroy its culture, industry and civil institutions.
When Vietnam ousted the Khmer Rouge and installed a new Communist Government, almost no doctors, lawyers, teachers or trained civil servants were left. A civil war ensued, during which few institutions were rebuilt, as the country remained isolated from most of the world.
A $2 billion effort coordinated by the United Nations established democratic forms of government in 1993 and huge amounts of foreign aid began flowing in. More than 100 non-governmental organizations now work in Cambodia, using foreign funds to provide everything from legal aid to irrigation projects to immunization programs.
But relatively little of the country's official budget reaches the people. In a statement last month, the United Nations complained that much of the budget was being drained off by military spending; much of the rest was disappearing into the pockets of Government officials.
Aid workers say their programs fill an additional, perhaps even more important need: training Cambodians in the basic skills and principles of administering a democratic society.
Indeed, the Cambodians they are training represent the foundation of what could become a genuine democratic opposition. An immediate fear among these workers after the coup was that it would be Mr. Hun Sen himself -- not foreign governments -- who would shut their agencies down.
"To the extent that non-governmental organizations represent a segment of civil society that is not controlled by the Government -- an alternative voice within the country -- their disappearance is not something the Government would be upset about," said an American aid worker, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The people of Kvet live much as they have for generations, and the Government plays little role in their lives.
Two years ago, the Government built a small clinic to serve seven neighboring villages, but it has no medicine. The Government also provided those villages with four water pumps, but the people here say they cannot afford the gasoline to run them.
Few people here have ever visited the capital, Phnom Penh, though it is less than an hour's drive away. But they could hear the big guns of Mr. Hun Sen's coup two weeks ago.
"We heard the sounds, boom, boom, boom," said Tith Sam On, who helps run literacy and health care programs here for Ms. Serey Phal's organization. "We were afraid it was war again."
Since then, villagers said, the political upheaval in Phnom Penh has had no effect on their lives. But they seemed terrified today by the prospect that aid could be halted.
"Please continue the aid!" cried a group of old women who were gathered for a ceremony at a local temple, when a foreign visitor arrived. "Don't stop the aid! Have pity on the people!"
Cheoun Pheap, 37, said the cow she had received from the Cambodian Women's Development Association offered hope that her five children could live a better life than she and her husband, who works as a laborer for $1.70 a day.
Her 10-year-old daughter, Net, who cares for her younger siblings when her parents are working in the fields, said she wanted to be the first in her family to finish all seven years of school.
"I want to be a nurse," she said, "and help the people of the village."

HEADLINE: As Leaders Bicker, Haiti Stagnates and Its People Fret

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 18

 BODY:
Nearly three years after American troops and aid began pouring into this country in an effort to build democracy and a working economy, the Haitian Government is all but paralyzed by internal squabbling that has left the economy moribund and the populace irate.
The latest crisis began early in June when Prime Minister Rosny Smarth resigned after intense criticism by allies of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Six weeks later, no replacement has been found, $100 million in vital foreign aid is still bottled up in Parliament, and a runoff election seen as the first step to resolving the stalemate has been indefinitely postponed. 
 The dispute has eroded the prestige of President Rene Preval, a disciple of Mr. Aristide, who now finds himself advocating policies the former President has publicly attacked and sought to undermine.
"Preval doesn't know what to do," said Jean-Claude Bajeux, who was Mr. Aristide's Minister of Culture and is now critical of the former President. "He is torn between his fidelity to Aristide and his duties as chief of state."
As the stalemate drags on, people's impatience and frustration are growing. Prices are rising, jobs are scarce, electricity blackouts are more frequent, and the quality of other public services is declining.
By law, the caretaker Government now in place is prohibited from introducing new legislation, which might ease these pressures. But Parliament cannot even assemble a quorum to vote on several bills already introduced, whose passage is a requirement for release of the foreign aid that makes up 60 percent of the Government's budget.
"The political class is wasting time playing stupid games," said Monfort Jean-Jacques, 25, who was playing dominoes with a friend at a downtown street corner here because, they said, neither could find work. "In the meantime, all the rest of us are struggling to survive."
For the most part, such discontent has not yet led to violence. But several weeks ago, teachers, some of whom had not been paid in more than a year, went on strike just as final exams were to be held, provoking street protests by students that turned into rock-throwing, tire-burning and clashes with the police.
In an interview here, Mr. Preval pointed to several Government commissions or agencies he said were continuing normal activities. But with very little money in the pipeline, he has been reduced to promoting a school uniform program as if it were a major initiative and pleading with Haitians to give him more time to assemble a new Government that can function properly.
"Today, the car is in the repair shop, and they are checking the spark plugs and other parts," Mr. Preval said at a news conference this week with Bill Richardson, the American delegate to the United Nations, which has a peacekeeping mission here whose mandate expires July 31. "I don't want to start the car in Port-au-Prince and get stuck on the road. I want to be able to drive it all the way to Cap-Haitien."
One of the two quarreling factions in the coalition that American troops restored to power in September 1994 supports Mr. Preval and controls the largest bloc of seats in Parliament. It favors a program to sell off money-losing state companies and talks of building a political system based on parties, not personalities. The other faction, loyal to Mr. Aristide, who may run for President again, argues that the Government's privatization plan betrays the country's impoverished majority.
Tensions between the groups erupted after balloting in April for the Senate and local councils. Mr. Aristide's new party came out ahead in that vote, which attracted less than 10 percent of the electorate and has been widely criticized by international monitoring groups for widespread irregularities. The faction supporting Mr. Preval is demanding that those results be annulled and the election commission overhauled.
In an interview, William L. Swing, the American Ambassador, said he viewed the impasse as "prima facie evidence that democracy is working." He said it was "just a question of how long it is going to take them to put a package together," an assessment that other diplomats repeated.
"We've seen this type of situation before -- the country comes close to the brink and a solution is achieved," said Enrique ter Horst, director of the United Nations mission here. "I am confident it will also happen this time."
In public, the President has been careful not to criticize Mr. Aristide for behavior that most diplomats here, and many of his countrymen, regard as obstructionist.
Asked this week whether he regarded Mr. Aristide as a supporter of his Government or the leader of the opposition, Mr. Preval would not respond. "I think it would be better for you to ask the person concerned, not myself," he said in an interview at the National Palace. "It is dangerous to speak on behalf of someone else."
Mr. Aristide himself has been vague and elusive. At a news conference on Tuesday that coincided with his 44th birthday, he spoke of the need to "engage in a national dialogue with all sectors" in order to "reach a political equilibrium," but also said the results of the April vote should be ratified.
The United States faces a quandary. Having made a large political and economic investment in the restoration of democracy here, the Clinton Administration does not want to see the Government collapse in squabbling that would discredit the international effort or encourage Haitians once again to set sail for Florida.
Mr. Preval "ought to be given the opportunity and diplomatic space to govern," Nicholas Burns, a State Department spokesman, said last month. "It is very difficult to succeed someone as charismatic and popular as President Aristide."
But Mr. Aristide, whom Haitians and foreigners alike regard as likely to return to office when elections are held in 2000, if not before, must also be taken into account. That approach, though, only feeds speculation that Mr. Aristide is the country's real center of power.
Mr. Preval's first choice as the new Prime Minister is said to be Eric Pierre, who is Haiti's delegate to the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington. But diplomats and Haitian leaders say Mr. Pierre is just the kind of figure who would be anathema to the Aristide camp: a technocrat committed to a program of reduced spending and privatization of state companies.
"Whether he comes from abroad, from heaven, or a political party is of no interest to me," Mr. Preval said when asked what qualities he was seeking in a nominee. Then, with a rueful laugh, he added, "I just hope he doesn't come from hell."

HEADLINE: Item in Tax Bill Poses Threat to Job Benefits

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
In Congress and in thousands of workplaces, the nation's business community is seeking to change longstanding rules and practices to turn many people classified as employees into independent contractors -- a move that could cause many Americans to lose health insurance and pension and unemployment insurance benefits.
In a little-noticed provision in its tax bill, the House of Representatives has approved a new -- and, many experts say, more inclusive -- test to determine who is an independent contractor. The Clinton Administration is fighting the provision, asserting that it would strip millions of workers of their basic benefits. But business groups say the legislation is needed to clarify the often fuzzy definition of who is an independent contractor. 
 Outside Capitol Hill, employers from small construction companies to giants like Microsoft and Pacific Bell are increasingly hiring new workers as independent contractors rather than as traditional employees -- a not entirely new practice that is expanding rapidly as employers strain to cut costs. Such a strategy not only gives employers more flexibility to shrink their work forces, but it saves them thousands of dollars per worker because companies do not have to make Social Security, Medicare, unemployment insurance or workers' compensation contributions for independent contractors.
"What's clear is employers are seeking increasingly to have more flexible arrangements," said Sara Horowitz, the executive director of Working Today, an advocacy group on workplace issues. "But what that means in reality is people are working increasingly without benefits. They're working not only without health coverage but without the protections of the major labor legislation of this century: pensions, minimum wage, occupational safety, unemployment insurance, age discrimination. The list goes on."
Opponents of this practice say companies are wrongly lumping people usually considered employees, like truck drivers and middle-level managers, into the independent contractor category, which traditionally referred to people in business for themselves.
At last year's Olympic Games in Atlanta, for example, several hundred broadcast technicians hired by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games had to sign contracts saying they were freelance independent contractors rather than employees, who are protected by overtime and unemployment insurance laws. A Maryland catering company that books 1,000 events a year insists that the 75 waiters it hires on average for each event are independent contractors, not employees. Texas A & M University recently hired 400 low-wage farm workers for its 18 agricultural extension programs and classified them as independent contractors rather than employees -- a move the Internal Revenue Service found to be illegal. Pacific Bell laid off hundreds of experienced middle managers several years ago and has hired many of them back as independent contractors, but without the health insurance, pension plan and unemployment coverage they used to have.
Corporate America defends the trend toward hiring independent contractors, saying it gives companies the flexibility to cut back easily during downturns. Business groups also assert that because this is an age when Americans are becoming more entrepreneurial and are increasingly working at home thanks to computers, it only makes sense to classify more workers as contractors.
The corporate groups that have persuaded the House and are pushing the Senate to rewrite the definition of who is an independent contractor contend that the legislation is needed because the common-law definition is arcane and vague. They say that because many companies fear harsh I.R.S. punishment, existing law pushes employers to classify workers as employees when they should be considered independent contractors.
Nelson Litterst, manager of legislative affairs for the National Federation of Independent Business, a small-business group that is pushing hard for the legislation, said: "The interest of small business has never been to find loopholes in the law to create wholesale switches of workers to independent contractors. Our intention is to clarify the definition so there is less of a gray area."
But a senior Treasury Department official argued that the provision passed by the House appeared intended to greatly increase the number of independent contractors, currently 8.3 million. "The number of employees who will be shifted will be in the millions," said the official, who characterized the House legislation as far broader than traditional definitions of independent contractor. "I'm not even sure if I would characterize this provision as a sieve. A sieve at least strains things out."
Martin Regalia, chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, interprets the House language far more restrictively, saying it merely defines borders instead of opening up new territory. "To allege there will be wholesale expansion of independent contractors and that thousands of individuals will lose their benefits is pure rhetoric," he said.
The A.F.L.-C.I.O. is working to torpedo the House provision on independent contractors, insisting that it would eliminate basic protections for millions of workers, creating a cost advantage for many employers that would in turn push their competitors to transform their workers into independent contractors. That trend is especially worrisome for organized labor, which is struggling to increase its ebbing numbers, because independent contractors are not allowed to form or join unions under Federal labor law.
"What you have here is another window into the Republican leadership's view of the role of government," said Peggy Taylor, the labor federation's director of legislative affairs. "In this instance, they're trying to put government on the side of those corporations and employers who want to get away from any responsibilities for the people who work for them."
Because the House included the independent contractor provision in its tax bill, but the Senate inserted no such language in its tax bill, Administration officials and members of Congress say it is hard to predict whether conferees will keep the provision in the final tax bill.
The House language, introduced by Jon Christensen, Republican of Nebraska, sets up three tests to determine who is an independent contractor:
First, there should be a written contract between the worker and the company.
Second, the worker has a principal place of business that is not the company's, does not work primarily at the company's place of business or rents an office at the company. An alternative second test is whether the worker is not required to work exclusively for the company and whether the worker performed a significant amount of work for other companies the previous year.
If a worker meets the first and second tests, satisfying any of the following criteria makes a worker an independent contractor: The worker has "a significant investment in assets and/or training," the worker is primarily paid on commission, the worker has significant unreimbursed expenses or the worker's service is for a specific amount of time to complete a specific task.
Mr. Regalia, the Chamber of Commerce economist, said these criteria would create far more certainty than the common-law test, which turns on whether the employer controls not just the results of a worker's service but the means a worker uses, such as the route a worker drives or how a worker dresses.
But analyses prepared by the Clinton Administration and the A.F.L.-C.I.O. indicate that the new test will sweep many more workers into the independent contractor category. Pizza deliverers could easily become independent contractors because they do not work primarily on their company's place of business, they own their cars (a significant investment in assets), and they obtain most earnings from tips (primarily paid by commissions). Similarly, carpenters and painters might overwhelmingly be considered independent contractors because they own their tools (a significant investment in assets), they do no work on their companies' premises and they might sign a contract to do a specific job over a specific period.
According to the Treasury, many secretaries could become independent contractors if companies pay them a little extra and then require them to buy their own computers and pay a modest rent for their offices.
"We're heading into a two-tiered economy," said Ms. Horowitz of Working Today, the advocacy group. "The first tier has a New Deal safety net, protected by all the different labor laws. Then there is a second tier that's short term, flexible, many of them independent contractors. That tier doesn't receive benefits or labor law protections.
"The labor law and social protections are completely out of sync with this work force. If the rules of the game are changing and people are going to become independent contractors, then we have to have a new safety net that serves these people, too."

HEADLINE: Under the World's Eye, Postwar Liberia Goes to the Polls

BYLINE: By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr. 

DATELINE: MONROVIA, Liberia, July 19

 BODY:
Under the unusually attentive eyes of a world that normally ignores it, this African nation founded by American slaves went to the polls today in what is hoped will be its first free and fair election.
Former President Jimmy Carter is here to watch, along with a White House special envoy and delegations from the United Nations, the European Union, the Organization of African Unity and other organizations. About 500 outside monitors are in the country to keep an eye on about 2,000 polling places. 
 And in a capital that normally has only two FM radio stations, there are now temporarily eight, one set up by the United States and one by the Roman Catholic Church, which both want access to more objective news coverage. Three of the others are controlled by former faction leaders. To make sure that rural Liberians hear the news, the United Nations has handed out 5,500 wind-up radios, to avoid the need for electricity, which is scarce, or batteries, which are expensive.
By early afternoon in Monrovia, there appeared to be a large turnout at the polls, and voting was proceeding without incident.
With no reliable opinion polls, the outcome is anybody's guess. Among the 13 candidates are 2 leading antagonists, each boasting with absolute certainty that he or she will collect the 51 percent needed to win on the first ballot.
The first is Charles Taylor, 49, who was both a student and a prison escapee in Massachusetts before returning to Liberia in 1989 to lead a coup. That led to occupation by troops from other West African countries, seven years of civil war in the countryside and the destruction of much of Monrovia last year.
The second is Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, 58, a Harvard-educated former Citibank vice president and United Nations official in charge of African development. She once supported Mr. Taylor in his coup against the dictator Samuel K. Doe, but changed her mind as the ensuing war became increasingly vicious.
Several diplomats have predicted that neither will win a majority, and that in a runoff two weeks from now most other candidates will back Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf.
The worry is that Mr. Taylor will prove a sore loser. Even though the militias that sacked Monrovia last spring have nominally been disbanded, everyone thinks Mr. Taylor could rearm his soldiers, many of whom are youths. But in his final campaign speech, on Thursday, he assured a crowd, "To those of you who are worried about violence -- you have nothing to fear from me."
A Nigerian-led peacekeeping force now controls the country. There are soldiers at every border post, in every village of more than 500 people and at checkpoints throughout the capital. On a 10-minute drive through downtown, a car may easily be stopped 5 times, and the trunk checked for weapons.
The force's jocular but tough-talking commander, Maj. Gen. Victor Malu, has warned that his troops will "go after" any losing candidate who tries to resort to violence, and the response, he has said, will be "heavy and decisive."
During the campaign, when candidates were threatened in rural areas, General Malu assigned each a military escort and gathered party leaders to warn against violence.
In the last six months, former militia members have turned in 20,000 weapons. General Malu said his troops had not been confronted by armed men since February, even during arms raids of houses.
But the 10-nation peacekeeping force's mission ends in 6 months, and Nigeria and Ghana, the largest contributors, are said to be eager to drop the expense.
The United States, which has helped finance the mission, has also spent $7.5 million to help assure that the election goes well today. Its chief interest is in seeing democracy succeed, said William B. Malim, the American Ambassador.
The United States is deeply entangled in the history of Liberia, which was settled by freed slaves in 1822 and declared independent in 1847. English here is spoken in the antebellum accents of rural Carolina counties, and many Liberians have studied in the United States, have relatives there and wonder why the average American is not more concerned with the fate of this country. The United States used to have important C.I.A. listening posts and military stores here, and Firestone has the world's largest rubber plantation.
Diplomats from the United Nations and other agencies said they were pleased with the preparations for the election. About 750,000 out of an estimated million voting-age Liberians have been registered, although all figures are a bit shaky. The civil war is believed to have killed 150,000 of the 2.4 million population and driven 1.5 million from their homes, many into exile in neighboring countries.
Ballot boxes have been delivered to rural areas. The elections commission has agreed to report all the tallies as they come in, which cuts down the possibility of fraud. And wild rumors that spread during the campaign -- like one that the ballot lines for Mr. Taylor's party were printed in disappearing ink -- have been quickly denied.
Voters are also being asked today to choose a vice president and a legislature comprising 26 senators and 64 representatives.
The campaigning between Mr. Taylor and Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf has been personal and ugly. He has called her candidacy "an insult to traditional Liberian women," who he said do not think women should hold office. He has put himself forward as the only candidate strong enough to insure peace.
She calls herself the only candidate without blood on her hands and the best qualified to fix the country's economy. She has called Mr. Taylor a "desperate man, grabbing at straws," and has accused him of telling rural voters that he had already won and inviting them to the victory party.
On the street, people profess love for their candidates, though it is often unquestioning love.
"Charles Taylor spoiled this country, so he's the best man to fix it," insisted Carro Kannah, 19. "I'm going to sleep at the voting place tonight to be the first to vote for Charles Ghankay Taylor."
A 25-year-old supporter of Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf who spoke on condition of anonymity said: "God is never unjust. Everyone who votes for Charles Taylor tomorrow will be punished." The woman described seeing Mr. Taylor's boy soldiers hack her stepfather to death with a cutlass for being a former policeman. Her two young children died of malnutrition in the civil war, she said.
While Mrs. Johnson-Sirleaf has borrowed against her United Nations pension and does her campaigning in old cars, Mr. Taylor has a fleet of four-wheel-drive vehicles and even a helicopter, and can afford to feed and give T-shirts to voters who attend his rallies.
Poor as Liberia is, it exports diamonds, gold, hardwoods and rubber, and Mr. Taylor's party has held official posts that have allowed it to collect fees on exports.
In 1985, according to the newsletter Africa Confidential, Mr. Taylor escaped from Plymouth County jail in Massachusetts, where he had been held for 15 months on an extradition request filed by the Liberian Government of Mr. Doe. That Government accused Mr. Taylor, its former General Services Agency director, of embezzling $1 million. Mr. Taylor's lawyer, Ramsey Clark, said the charge was trumped up.
Asked earlier this month how the United States would react to a Taylor presidency, Nicholas Burns, the State Department spokesman, said: "Lots of people with checkered pasts participate in elections. Redemption is an important theological element in diplomacy."

HEADLINE: A Year Later, Some Atlantans Are Asking: What Olympic Legacy?

BYLINE: By RICK BRAGG 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 19

 BODY:
For two weeks last summer, even the sky seemed bluer.
Many Atlanta residents, frightened of rumors of huge traffic jams during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games, left their polluting cars at home. The commuters rode public transportation, car-pooled, worked at home or went on vacation. The sky, usually shrouded in a dingy, grayish-brown haze from the freeway system that surrounds the city, was bright and clear. 
 Freakishly, even the weather was less humid and cooler than normal, as if the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, which organized the event, had bought off God. Former Mayor Andrew Young had, indeed, prayed hard for a cool spell.
Today, one year after the Games began, the traffic and haze are back, the heat and humidity are again at a stifling norm, and Atlantans are asking if the Olympics left any significant legacy, or if it was all just an interesting break in routine.
The consensus, even from some who worked to make the Games a success, seems to be that the lasting effect of this event fell short of expectations in most ways. The Olympics left Atlanta with a grand new baseball field and an assortment of other new and renovated sports venues, but the Games do not seem to have become a seminal moment in history, not in economics, not in the city's character and certainly not as a boon for poor neighborhoods.
And no one seems very surprised. Expectations, many here said, were just too ridiculously high.
The impact was "less than many people would like to think it would have been," said Lyn May, former director of communications for the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, now vice president of the Georgia Foundation for Independent Colleges. "There was always an overestimation of what the Games were supposed to be."
She added: "Any time you set your expectations too high, you're going to be disappointed. People did, and people are."
It is not so hard to find the worst legacy of the Games, the bombing in Centennial Olympic Park that killed an Albany, Ga., woman. That crime, which resulted in the bizarre investigation and later exoneration of Richard Jewell, a security guard, is still unsolved, and investigators seem no closer now than in 1996.
It is also not difficult to find the lasting changes in the city's infrastructure. But most of the new construction the Olympics ushered in -- like the Olympic Stadium that is now home to the Atlanta Braves, the Olympic Village, now student housing, and the Olympic Natatorium, a spot for the Georgia Institute of Technology's community to cool off -- was work that had to be done simply to accommodate the events. Some had hoped that the Olympics would quickly spark construction of other new business and housing.
While there has been a sprinkling of new housing in poor neighborhoods, more or less linked to the Games, the building has been less than expected.
"The biggest impact it had was on the construction industry and the infrastructure improvements that were made, the biggest part of that before the Olympics," said Kenneth L. Bernhardt, professor of marketing at Georgia State University.
Construction unrelated to the Games was deferred a year or so by the frenzy of the pre-Olympic building. "That prevented a major recession," Mr. Bernhardt said. "That helped even out things post-Olympics."
"We got a boost that put us on a higher plateau than we otherwise would have been on," Mr. Bernhardt said, "but there's very little legacy in terms of its long-term economic impact. People don't invest their capital because a city has the Olympics. That was part of the hype."
There was plenty of hype.
Billy Payne, the chief executive officer of the Atlanta committee, had predicted "the greatest peacetime event in the 20th century."
That, as people like to say down here, was a tough row to hoe. But Mr. Payne stands by his predictions of an economic windfall.
"I laugh about folks who are impatient about it," said Mr. Payne, now a vice president at Nationsbank in Atlanta. "We've created a location which has overnight seen sellers of land literally licking their chops. We have not yet seen the forces of supply and demand meet."
Mayor Bill Campbell agreed. "The economy is poised for success in the future," he said.
But others are less optimistic.
When the Games were over, Atlantans and Georgians and Southerners in general would describe the Olympics as one of the most exciting times of their lives, and say that just being part of the event -- however small a part -- was a treasured memory.
But Atlanta reached for much more than that, in a flare of chest-thumping civic pride that some visitors tried to douse early with criticism, contending that Atlanta fell short of Barcelona, the host in 1992. Then, when the Olympic Committee president, Juan Antonio Samaranch, refused to proclaim Atlanta "the best Olympics ever," as is the custom -- the latest one is always supposed to be the best -- it hurt.
Of the international press -- much of which criticized Atlanta for problems in everything from transportation to computers -- Ms. May said, "That was colored by their self-centered need to be coddled. As a result, Atlanta ended up with a less glowing image than we would have hoped."
But most people, "who saw wonderful events, who saw records broken, most of those people will tell you they'd come back to Atlanta," she said.
What they have not seen is a city that followed through on its grand promises. A year later, Centennial Olympic Park is still under construction. While Mr. Campbell says the downtown is more vibrant than ever before, nightfall still chases away most people except the homeless. The Olympic Games were supposed to create an atmosphere that would draw people to this sterile area of high-rise buildings.
The poor neighborhoods that were supposed to see major redevelopment were mostly disappointed. Of the 16 downtown neighborhoods targeted for redevelopment, only two areas, Summerhill and Techwood, saw new housing and other improvements, said Steven P. French, director of city planning at Georgia Tech.
But Atlanta, an image-conscious city that seems to be forever striving for bigger and bigger conventions and recognition as a true international city, will ultimately, like any good public relations firm, discard the bad and talk up the good.
"Atlanta had a pretty good self-image and sense of itself, even before the Games," Ms. May said. "Atlanta was full of itself even before the Games. Atlanta is like an egotistical guy. His pants may be a little shorter than they should be, and he may be balding a little on top, but he has not lost one bit of his swagger."

HEADLINE: Policy Centers Rethink Their Images

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 19

 BODY:
The staid community of Washington "think tanks" has been trying over the last year or so to find new ways to capture the attention of a post-cold-war America, realizing that the only way they can change the world is to get somebody to listen.
The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace has hired a new president known for applying her scientific training to new, "global" issues like terrorism and the environment. And it has revamped its magazine, "Foreign Policy," to look more like a literary magazine and to grab a broader audience.. 
 Over at the Brookings Institution, the new President, Michael H. Armacost, feared that the organization was too closely associated with the Democratic Party and that people were too busy to read its scholarly research. Mr. Armacost hired a centrist Republican to direct foreign policy studies. He is known for his quick mind and media savvy and has become one of Washington's most quoted experts. At the same time, Brookings is paring down its list of fellows and asking them to write shorter research summaries, or "policy briefs," for Washington politicians and professionals.
The appointments of Jessica T. Mathews, 51, as head of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and Richard N. Haass, 45, at Brookings, are supposed to be part of each institute's answer for a new look, and desire for new financial support.
Ms. Mathews made her mark as an innovator. A former Washington Post columnist, she turned down a top job in the Clinton Administration to become Carnegie's president. While she is well-grounded in traditional areas and has served on the board of both Carnegie and Brookings, her appointment is emblematic of the search for a new, more global rationale.
"I don't think my appointment had symbolic value to the search committee," she said in her sunny, spacious office. "But it clearly does to others," who have sent her hundreds of letters.
In part, she said, it is "a sense that I don't have a traditional foreign-policy background," with a career-long effort to try to integrate new themes like the spread of nuclear weapons, human rights and the environment and new actors into foreign policy. And in part it is her ability, like Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, to break gender ceilings.
The changes at Brookings, which also has major divisions in economic and governmental studies, are less striking and more traditional. For the last 18 months Mr. Armacost has been engineering a quiet shake-up to make it more nonpartisan "in a way that shapes the public agenda and is useful to policy makers," he said.
"The public is looking for practical answers, not ideology," he added.
At a time when money for foreign policy is decreasing , whether in Congress or among charitable foundations, there is a new, competitive concentration on salesmanship -- getting the message pithy and quotable, for legislators and a wider, national audience.
The paradox, as Mr. Haass sees it, is that "as the old paradigms are shifting and nothing has taken their place," the study of foreign policy by outsiders should be thriving, since Government officials are generally too busy to think.
"But with the cold war over, there's less urgency, and interest in foreign policy is smaller than it's been in the last 30 or 40 years," he said.
Ms. Mathews said the main difficulty for the policy research groups, a problem Ms. Albright also faces, is that "while there is general recognition that we're the indispensable nation, the question remains, 'Indispensable for what?' "
"But the one-answer answer isn't working, and without one answer in a sound-bite society, it's hard" to articulate a rationale without the cold war's military imperative, she said.
Starting as a science adviser to Congress with a Ph.D. in molecular biology, Ms. Mathews became director of issues and research in Morris Udall's 1976 presidential campaign, and then, at 30, created the Office of Global Issues in Zbigniew Brzezinski's National Security Council under President Jimmy Carter, where Mr. Armacost and Ms. Albright also served.
Her mother, the late historian Barbara Tuchman, pushed her to write -- "she said it's a muscle you need," Ms. Mathews remembered, "and a way to learn to write is through journalism." After President Carter's defeat, she wrote editorials for The Washington Post for three years, then helped found the World Resources Institute, one of the first research institutions to focus on the environment and Government policy. When she left 11 years later, its staff had grown from 3 to 110, and taught her about institution-building, fund-raising and promoting research that affects Government policy.
She left to enter the the Clinton Administration as Deputy Under Secretary on Global Affairs, but quit in frustration after nine months. The size of the bureaucracy, its traditional training and emphasis on crisis management made it hard to concentrate on global issues.
"It's the difference between a chronic illness and a severe one," she said. "In Government, you think it's all about the cables you read, and it's hard to see that things are happening that are beyond your control."
Increasingly, she argues, key actors are nongovernmental agencies or citizens' groups like Amnesty International and international institutions like the World Bank or the United Nations.
Other institutions, like the Heritage Foundation or the Cato Institute, continue to thrive on more ideological grounds. This use of ideas as weapons crafted for political wars by "combat intellectuals" -- rather than "nonideological tools to be employed by policy makers regardless of their political affiliation" -- was the focus of a valedictory essay by Charles William Maynes, after 17 years of running Foreign Policy, Carnegie's subsidized magazine.
The magazine's first issue under a new editor, Moises Naim, has just appeared, with shorter articles, summaries of key articles in foreign and foreign-language journals, more reviews of books published abroad, a new web site, and more photographs. While Carnegie has a large endowment, raising funds is increasingly important as some traditional givers, like the Pew Charitable Trust, have stopped financing foreign-policy projects.
Ms. Mathews also wants to address "this whole question of public attention to foreign policy, of which the shrinking pool of funds is a reflection." Polls show great public interest in foreign policy, "while there's a complete disconnect between the polls and Congress," which is more isolationist. "The problem is not the general public so much but Congress," she said. "We have to really think about this."
Brookings is also thinking about where to downsize. On the Middle East or arms control, "a lot of the conceptual work has been done," Mr. Haass said. "It needs to be implemented, but that's insider work." He has encouraged some scholars to go into Government or do field work to re-energize themselves and favors shorter-term appointments.
"I see Brookings as a place where you spend part of a career," he said. "Maybe people shouldn't spend 40 years at a think tank."

HEADLINE: WESTCHESTER BRIEFS

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:

Dual Infection Possible
For the first time, researchers at the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla have proved that a person can become ill with Lyme disease and ehrlichiosis simultaneously. Although the possibility of a dual occurrence had been suspected by doctors for several years, it had never been documented. The findings were published in the July 3 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. 
 There were earlier instances in which patients were believed to be infected with both tick-borne illnesses, but the diagnoses were not considered definitive because they were based on blood tests, which can only suggest and not confirm dual exposure to the diseases.
The new findings should put residents of Westchester, Rockland, Putnam, Dutchess, Ulster, Orange, Suffolk and Fairfield Counties -- where the diseases are prevalent -- on the alert, doctors said.
It will also alter the prescribed medical treatment for the illnesses. For example, Lyme disease has often been treated with amoxicillin, which is not effective against ehrlichiosis. Now doxycycline is the recommended treatment for cases of dual infection.
In related news, Gov. George E. Pataki last week vetoed a bill proposed by the Action League for Lyme, based in Chappaqua. The bill would have expanded the governing committee of the State Department of Health's Tick-Borne Disease Institute to include Lyme victims, patient advocates, doctors, local health department officials and legislators.
The Governor said the bill was not consistent with his desire to streamline government. State Assemblyman Ronald C. Tocci of New Rochelle, a sponsor of the bill, said he would work to resubmit it
 
Layoffs Imminent
About 140 workers at the White Plains-based Tambrands are facing layoffs as early as this fall as a result of the company's recent merger with Procter & Gamble.
Scott Stewart, a spokesman for Procter & Gamble in Cincinnati, said the layoffs will occur now that the merger has been approved by regulators in several countries where Tambrands conducts business. The United States Justice Department had already authorized the $1.85 billion deal.
Most of the Tambrands employees in White Plains work in sales, marketing and financial services. Tambrands produces Tampax and has two manufacturing plants in this country -- in Claremont, N.H., and Auburn, Me. The company, which employs 2,600 workers worldwide, also operates plants in Britain, Ukraine and China.
Procter & Gamble markets some 300 brands, including Tide detergent, Crest toothpaste, Pampers disposable diapers, Ivory soap, Head and Shoulders shampoo and Bounty paper towels.
Mr. Stewart said the White Plains offices on Westchester Avenue would be closed. The company occupies about 76,000 square feet in the 128,000-square-foot building and has a lease until 2001, the spokesman said.
 
No Tuition Increases
County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke, has submitted his budget for Westchester Community College, and students at the two-year college can sigh with relief.
For the first time in seven years, there is no tuition increase scheduled for the coming year for full-time students who pay $2,350 a year, said the college's president, Joseph N. Hankin.
"We don't want to decrease access in any way to the college," Dr. Hankin said.
The proposed community college budget for 1997-98 is $48.6 million, with gross capital costs of $1.7 million. For the first time in four years, the college will add 10 new positions to meet the demand for expanded campus, student and computer services.
The student body is 58 percent female, 42 percent male and from "lower socio-economic backgrounds," Dr. Hankin said. The average age of a student is 29, he said.
"Many of the students are needy," he said. "We were afraid of approaching that point of discouraging them because the tuition kept going up."
 
Settlement in Blast
A settlement of $2.25 million has been reached in lawsuits resulting from a propane truck crash on Interstate 287 in 1994.
The defendants in the suit -- Ryder Truck Rental, which owned the truck, and Paraco Gas Corporation, which hired the driver -- reached the settlement with the plaintiffs -- 15 people living within 400 feet of the blast -- in the fifth day of a trial in State Supreme Court in White Plains.
Henry Miller, a lawyer representing 14 plaintiffs, said 2 of the plaintiffs, Edward and Michelle Brunner, testified in court about how the propane tank exploded, shot 300 feet in the air like a missile and landed in their bedroom.
Twelve other lawsuits have been settled out of court, but the terms were not disclosed.
Earlier this year, Paraco was fined $1 million by a Federal judge in Federal District Court in White Plains after the company admitted to falsifying records of drivers' hours. The company violated Federal safety regulations, which mandate periods of rest for truck operators.
Last year, the National Transportation Safety Board found that the accident occurred when Peter Conway, the 23-year-old driver, fell asleep at the wheel. Mr. Conway died in the explosion.
 
Golf Course Plans
The Briarcliff Manor Planning Board has taken its first formal look at a draft environmental impact statement submitted by Donald Trump to renovate and expand the 144-acre Briar Hall Country Club. The proposal before the board is to expand the course, rebuild the clubhouse and build 87 town houses.
Lynn M. Crumb, Briarcliff Manor's manager, said that although a previous owner of the property had obtained the village's approval to build 87 residences, some neighbors were upset that the houses would be near them. The previous plans called for 12 town houses and 75 housing units in a single building. Under Mr. Trump's plans, there would be 87 town houses.
Because of the lengthy review process, Mr. Crumb estimated it would be at least six months before Mr. Trump could put a shovel in the ground.
Mr. Trump also plans to build a golf course with surrounding houses on his Seven Springs Estate, which stradles the towns of New Castle, Bedford and North Castle, and the county is planning to build a golf course -- its sixth -- in New Castle. The course would be built on 150 acres off Route 134 to be bought from I.B.M. The course, Hudson Hills, would cost about $9.7 million, County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke said.
Two public hearings were held last week on the proposal. Interested citizens who missed the hearing can still obtain a copy of the executive summary of the draft environmental impact statement by calling the county Department of Planning at 285-4400.
 
How to Ride the Ferry
The Hudson Maritime Company, which runs a ferry service from Peekskill to Bear Mountain State Park and West Point from May through October, operates only on weekends.
Ferries depart from Peekskill's Riverfront Green Dock at 10:15 A.M. and 1 P.M., with the last trip returning to Peekskill at 3:45 P.M. Round-trip fares to West Point are $14, $7 for children. Round-trip fares to Bear Mountain are $12, $6 for children. Babies and toddlers ride free.
Capt. Gregory A. Hanchrow can arrange weekday trips for groups of 15 or more.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Aging Shop of Horrors: The C.I.A. Limps to 50

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
ON July 26, 1947, with memories of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor still fresh and fear of a cold war rising, President Harry S. Truman signed the law that gave birth to the Central Intelligence Agency. Fifty years on, the elite C.I.A. has become a pariah in American culture, a prisoner of its public history as a spy agency.
The evil that spooks do lives after them; the good is interred by secrecy. The agency insists that it has scored dazzling successes over the decades, but prefers not to discuss them. And so people remember the Mafia hit men hired to kill Fidel Castro, the coups gone bad, the rebel groups seduced and abandoned, the drunken scoundrel Aldrich Ames. 
 Now, in sadness and anger, several of the men who led the agency through the cold war are saying that the C.I.A.'s heart itself is failing, that its clandestine service to the nation may be nearing the end of its useful life.
The agency has been on a losing streak ever since it won the cold war. Its last two directors, R. James Woolsey Jr. and John M. Deutch, blamed "the culture of the C.I.A," which in victory lost its elan. Milt Bearden, the agency's last chief of Soviet operations, said in a recent interview, "The collapse of our enemy ensured our own demise."
"The only remaining superpower doesn't have enough interest in what's going on in the world to organize and run an espionage service," said Richard M. Helms, the Director of Central Intelligence from 1966 to 1973. "We've drifted away from that as a country."
James R. Schlesinger, Mr. Helms's successor, says, "The trust that was reposed in the C.I.A. has faded." The spy service "is now so battered that its utility for espionage is subject to question."
Retired Adm. Stansfield Turner, the agency's director from 1977 to 1981, says the nation has to build a new clandestine service from the ground up, outside the C.I.A. And Duane R. Clarridge, a legendarily brash covert operator, writes in a new memoir that the C.I.A. "is finished as a really effective intelligence service."
The Central Intelligence Agency, Mr. Clarridge writes, "will be reinvented or restored to competency only after some appalling catastrophe befalls us" -- perhaps another Pearl Harbor.
The Japanese attack was predictable. But no one had pulled the facts together. The idea of the C.I.A., Mr. Helms said, "was that we've got to get an organization where analysts could look at everything from overseas, no matter how secret. The agency was created to analyze intelligence, not for covert action. It was no one's intention that the Agency should become identified with nothing but espionage." That the Central Intelligence Agency became known for spying, he said, was "an accident of history."
In 1948, the year after the C.I.A.'s founding, another new agency, the National Security Council, set up a clandestine service to fight fire with fire -- to counter what it called the "vicious covert activities of the U.S.S.R." with propaganda, economic warfare, sabotage, subversion and secret support for resistance groups. There was nowhere to hide that secret organization but the newborn C.I.A.
The C.I.A.'s charter members -- "bankers and tycoons, safecrackers and forgers, printers and playwrights, athletes and circusmen," as a future director, William J. Casey, wrote -- were a talented crew forged in the fires of World War II. New recruits came from the nation's best universities. Soon there were thousands. Their power grew with the cold war.
 
Send in the Spooks
 President Dwight D. Eisenhower told them to launch coups in Iran and Guatemala. "These succeeded," Mr. Helms said. "They attracted a lot of attention. With the attention, the C.I.A. was identified with covert action," a tool of an imperial President in imperiled times.
The agency convinced President John F. Kennedy that covert operations were a cheap alternative to sending in the marines -- then refuted the argument with the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961.
"Public support began to erode with the Bay of Pigs," Mr. Schlesinger said. So did a measure of Presidential support. President Lyndon B. Johnson never got over discovering the Kennedy-C.I.A.-Mafia plot to kill Castro. President Richard M. Nixon railed against the agency for failing to subvert the anti-war movement at home -- which would have been illegal. "What use are they?" he once asked. "They've got 40,000 people over there reading newspapers."
Throughout the 1960's, the C.I.A. briefed Gerald R. Ford, who was then a Congressman appropriating Pentagon funds. "They had charts on the walls, they had figures," President Ford recalled in a speech last month. "And their conclusion was that in 10 years, the United States would be behind the Soviet Union in military capability, in economic growth, in the strength of our economy. It was a scary presentation.
"The facts are," Mr. Ford continued, "they were 180 degrees wrong. These were the best people we had, the C.I.A.'s so-called experts."
In 1975, as Saigon fell, the C.I.A.'s own ramparts were breached by Congressional investigators who exposed the agency's relationships with foreign governments, generals and goon squads.
The investigations "set back our liaison relationships around the world; they caused many people abroad to pull away from cooperating with the C.I.A.; and they devastated the morale of perhaps the finest group of dedicated public servants this country has," President George Bush, the agency's director in 1976, said in a written response when asked about the C.I.A.'s performance during his tenure. By then, the last of the World War II generation of spies was out the door.
President Jimmy Carter, also in a written response, said there was never a hint of impropriety at the agency under his Naval Academy classmate, Admiral Turner, who cleaned house, canceled some long-running covert operations and started few new ones. "We were aware that some of the unqualified and incompetent personnel whom he discharged were deeply resentful," Mr. Carter said, "but I fully approved."
Then in the 1980's, Mr. Casey hired 2,000 new covert operators and revived the black arts of secret war. The revival ended with the indictments of the barons of the clandestine service. And while they were shipping missiles to the contras and to Iran, Mr. Ames, their Soviet counterintelligence branch chief, was smuggling secrets to the Russians.
Since 1991, the agency has had five directors; not one has lasted as long as two years. "We're a confused group, dying for stability," the agency's inspector general, Fred Hitz, said in a May speech. With the turnover at the top, those who remain worry about the brains and bravery of the new generation.
 
Too Many Yuppies
 The spy service no longer attracts America's best and brightest, Mr. Clarridge says. "I was saddled with an overabundance of yuppie spies," he writes. "For them, the C.I.A. was just a job."
The agency's chief analyst, John Gannon, recently spoke of its "lack of expertise." And in June, the House intelligence committee reported that the agency lacks "the analytic depth, breadth and expertise to monitor political, military and economic developments worldwide."
Mr. Helms's sense that American espionage is at the end of the line may seem like an epitaph. But as his biographer, Thomas Powers, put it, intelligence services are as inevitable as taxes and telephones. A nation with an army is going to have an intelligence agency. The question is what kind.
The agency may have to go back to its beginnings if it is to have much of a future. For in the beginning, the C.I.A. was going to be a small, sharp news service delivering hot tips and cool analysis to the President's desk, not the secret weapon of American foreign policy.
To succeed, Mr. Hitz says, the agency must focus on "five or six" targets, not a dozen, as it is doing, or a hundred, as it did a decade ago. The dirty half-dozen are easy to divine: the handful of heavily armed nations that might harm the United States. Mr. Helms says there are "too many people" and too much "bloat" in the clandestine service; a far smaller organization would be far sharper.
"The goals," Mr. Hitz said in May, "remain remarkably close to President Truman's original hopes for C.I.A. in 1947": to provide the President with "timely, focused intelligence information." That calls for exceptional people devoted to anonymous Government service -- and a revival of the cold-war spirit in a new generation.
Persuading a new generation to sign up with the C.I.A. will require restoring its reputation. There may be a way to do that: telling the public exactly how the agency helped win the cold war. But the C.I.A. has sworn to carry those secrets to the grave.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 30, 1998, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sept. 29 discussed the release of 60,000 secret documents on the killing of President John F. Kennedy. Their declassification occurred over a period, leading up to the final report of a citizens' commission created by Congress six years ago to dispel lingering suspicions that the truth had been hidden.
Discussing criticism of the Warren Commission, which investigated the assassination at the time, the article said that one member, Allen W. Dulles, a former Director of Central Intelligence, had failed to tell fellow members "that Kennedy had ordered the C.I.A. to assassinate Castro." The article did not cite evidence or authority for the assertion about the President.
 Earlier articles, on July 20, 1997, and Nov. 23, 1997, also declared without qualification that Kennedy ordered Fidel Castro's assassination.
A number of prominent historians and officials with knowledge of intelligence matters in that era have asserted in interviews that President Kennedy gave such an order. But others, also close to the President, dispute their account. The Times's practice is to attribute or qualify information that it is unable to report firsthand. That should have been done in these cases.

HEADLINE: LIVES;
A Holiday in Bali

BYLINE: By REBECCA CHACE; Rebecca Chae is the author of "Chautauqua Summer: Adventures of a Late-20th-Century Vaudevillian."

 BODY:
It is a spring evening in Bali. My husband and I are seated on cushions at a low table, sipping cold mango drinks. The sound of gamelan music is drifting toward us from one of the small lighted homes that seem almost suspended in the reflection of the still water of the rice paddies that stretch out in front of us. Our 5-year-old has long since passed out on the cushions, and the waiters come and go almost silently, avoiding her sprawl, with no expression of irritation.
 
 We are sitting with a group of American and British expatriates, who are passionately discussing the need to warn other Westerners of a spiritual teacher who they think is a charlatan. Well, of course he is, I'm thinking. What better place for a guru to set up shop than Bali? I don't say that out loud, however, because most of these people came to Bali in their late teens and early 20's to pursue spiritual disciplines and have ended up staying for 20 years. Instead I change the subject and ask about education for the children. One woman tells me that she sends her boys to the international school halfway down the island. That must be a long schelp, I say. Oh, no, she responds, I have a driver.
 That, in essense, is the definition of the expatriate community we found in Bali: baby-boomers, New Agers of a sort who are nonetheless living a completely 19th-century life style. Many of them have become entrepreneurs running small export and design companies. Because they can employ help both at home and at work for next to nothing, they are free to lead a life of contemplation, pursuing the Hindu or Buddhist teachings of simplicity, karma and transcendence of the material.
 Another woman I spoke to said she had always wanted a daughter in order to name her Sinead, a Gaelic name, but had only had sons. Then she went on: "So when the boys' Ama - she's been with us forever - had a girl, we named her Sinead." I was stunned "We?" I felt as if I were talking to Scarlett O'Hara. The catch was that this was not a young girl who had been brought up in the antebellum South, but a grown woman who had adopted this way of life rather than being born into it.
 It would be easy to say that I condemned them for this, or that they were well meaning but ultimately tyrannical. My dirty little secret is that I liked these people. They were smart and interesting. But as for having servants and never having to do any errand or chore that I didn't choose to do, I have to admit that for two weeks, I loved every minute of it. I was living the life of the idle rich for less than the cost of a room at a Best Western in Nebraska.
 We don't usually live like this. Even this two-week vacation took a year and a half to prepare for, and we might never have gone except that it was in honor of a good friend's 50th birthday. Our vacations tend to be done on frequent-flier miles to visit family, and the last time I went to Europe I was sleeping in a tent and sharing a van with five other people. (And that wasn't so long ago and I wasn't that young.)
 As I lay under the shade of a thatched bungalow near the beach innorthern Bali and received a full-body massage for an hour (for the equivalent of about $4), I did feel a little guilty, and very white. That was my problem - if it was indeed ever a problem - I couldn't live like a colonial in the Dutch East Indies without my good old American liberal guilt taking over. But I kept it at bay for as long as I could, and eyed the first-class cabin hungrily as I walked my daughter up and down the aisles on our 16-hour flight home. I remembered my father telling me that my grandfather's policy was always, "If we can't go first class, Jimmy, we don't go at all." Which of course meant that they never left town. But somewhere over Hawaii I thought he had had a pretty good point.
 When the pictures from our trip were developed, and I saw snapshots of us riding through the jungle on the back of an elephant like a family of self-satisfied pashas, I thought that it had been an incredible two weeks, but I also knew that I couldn't live in the Far East as my friends do. I wouldn't be able to close my ears to the overwhelming silence ofthe "help" who are waiting, endlessly waiting, for my next need to arise. It is a world of masters and servants, and despite one's best intentions it is not really possible to mold itinto something else. I assume that one would eventually stop trying and simplly attempt to be a good master.
 But while I was on vacation I behaved no differently than my colonialist friends; after I came back to my house in the States, with the dog, the shopping and the 5-year-old all competing for my time, I couldn't help asking my husband, with more than a touch of irony: Where are all the servants?

 ASPHALT NATION
 How the Automobile Took Over America, and How We Can Take It Back.

 THE CITY AFTER
 THE AUTOMOBILE
 An Architect's Vision.
 By Moshe Safdie with Wendy Kohn.
 Illustrated. 187 pp. New York:
 A New Republic Book/Basic Books. $24. 
 Americans, as all the world realizes, are peculiar. They own more cars and, paper coffee cups in hand, drive them farther than anyone else on the planet. Their town and city centers, especially after dark, are forlorn and quiet because most families shop, work and play on the urban edges, where free parking and well-maintained roads are expected as a kind of natural right. They set their houses far apart from one another, and in the middle of lawns that by the standards of other nations are gargantuan. They regard this suburban-style, automobile-dependent environment as, if not ideal, at least the inevitable result of a free people making free choices in a free market. Why, they think, would anyone want to live in a congested neighborhood when the alternative is a suburban Shangri-La?
 Moreover, the deconcentrated pattern of the United States seems to be in accord with the technological demands of the future and their possibilities. In recent years, such prominent authors as Paul Hawken, John Naisbitt and Alvin Toffler, among others, have created almost a cottage industry out of the prediction that a new science of telecommunications will make face-to-face interaction unnecessary in the 21st century. In their scenarios, automobiles are necessary; cities are not.
 To many observers, this is a vision of hell rather than of paradise, and at least since the publication of Jane Jacobs's "Death and Life of Great American Cities" in 1961, a series of authors has excoriated the drive-in, low-density character of the United States. Jane Holtz Kay's "Asphalt Nation" falls squarely within this tradition -- although it is more passionate and unforgiving than most of its predecessors. Essentially, Kay argues that unbridled, motorized sprawl has been destructive to our communities, destructive to our environment, destructive to our economic competitiveness and destructive to our safety. And that is just for starters.
 In her book's first section, "Car Glut: A Nation in Lifelock," Kay, the architecture critic for The Nation, reports that more driving does not mean more mobility because the number and length of trips needed for everyday life are increasing; that the elderly and the young, who are unable to drive, have been transformed into virtual prisoners; that the United States gives automobiles at least seven times the subsidies it earmarks for public transportation; that improvements in emission controls have been canceled out by an increase in miles driven; that salt used on ice and snow causes trees and vegetation to wither; and that Americans are fat because they drive rather than walk.
 The problem with tires is perhaps typical. Although most of us never think about the 250 million tires we collectively discard every year, one observer says: "You can't bury 'em. You can't put 'em in the water. No one will steal them. They're just there."
 Kay's second section, "Car Tracks: The Machine That Made the Land," explains how the automobile evolved from 1908, when Henry Ford introduced the Model T amid predictions that it would reduce pollution by replacing the horse, to 1954, when the United States became a net importer of oil, to the present, when Americans collectively spend eight billion hours each year stuck in traffic. The third section, "Car Free: From Dead End to Exit," points toward a future when, Kay hopes, the front porch, the corner grocery and pedestrian-friendly streets will be the norm rather than the exception.
 To her credit, Kay recognizes that the automobile is not the only culprit. She points out, for example, that Europeans have avoided many American problems not just because of high gasoline taxes and excellent public transportation systems but also because they regard land as a scarce resource to be controlled in the public interest rather than exploited by whoever happens to own it at a particular moment. Thus, European governments have traditionally exercised stringent controls over land development, and they have operated on the theory that the preservation of farms and open space is an appropriate national goal. In Dusseldorf, Germany, possibly the richest city in the world, truck farmers tend their crops within a couple of miles of the city's skyscrapers, not because alternative land uses would not yield a higher return, but because the law prohibits the very possibility of development.
 Although "Asphalt Nation" largely succeeds in proving that it is possible to get where we are going without destroying where we live, it does not offer a systematic argument, and it does not break new conceptual or methodological ground. Essentially, Kay has taken a hundred quotations and a hundred random statistics and cobbled them together into an attractive narrative package. The result is a well-written, even dramatic, volume that may persuade many readers to hop onto the bandwagon.
 One wishes, however, that Kay had more effectively anticipated and countered the likely questions of the 40-million-member American Automobile Association and the other powerful elements of the highway lobby. What do current gasoline taxes, meager as they are, pay for? Who should pay for the construction and repair of local roads that serve residential areas? If cars are becoming cleaner and more efficient over time, why will pollution not take care of itself? Who gets the bill for the uninsured motorists who cause the innocent to live out their days in wheelchairs? Are there many instances or places where motorists subsidize the general population, as is the case in New York, with its high bridge and tunnel tolls? If so, what has been the result? Why should a driver who never uses buses or subways contribute to their support? Does not the fact that Americans have purchased 250 million vehicles constitute a kind of referendum that government officials should respect? Kay has performed an important service in putting the issue of transportation before a potentially large audience, but she has only continued the debate, not taken it to a higher level.
 "The City After the Automobile," by Moshe Safdie, with Wendy Kohn, is a briefer and less ambitious volume that picks up where Kay leaves off. Safdie is an architect best known for Habitat, an attempt to revolutionize cities that was constructed for Montreal's Expo '67 (Kohn is the author of a monograph on his work), and like Kay, he proposes stronger land-use controls to restrict development on the urban edges. He points out, for example, that shopping malls are subsidized in hidden ways with public funds. Part of his book is an analysis of what has gone wrong with large agglomerations of people in the 20th century and part of it is a review of his plans -- some realized and some not -- for rebuilding sections of places as diverse as Las Vegas, Singapore, Israel and Italy.
 Safdie's most unusual suggestion is for the introduction of rentable electric automobiles, or "utility cars." Essentially, his idea is that while we need the convenience of private motor vehicles, they should be owned in common, and used by whoever needs them at a particular moment. Rather like taxis, except that we would drive them ourselves, they would be retrievable from storage depots and would be kept by a person or a family only as long as they are needed, with billing in accordance with time and mileage.
 Another of Safdie's ideas is for a "New Cardo," or "linear center," a mile-long place of maximum interaction that would become a public arena for concentrated development. This proposal is rather fanciful and not fully discussed, but it at least has the virtue of being a potential replacement for the ubiquitous shopping mall.
 Taken together, these books deliver an important message in suggesting that the solution to congestion, to environmental pollution and to urban decay is not more cars and wider roads but more effective planning and more responsive public transportation. As Jane Holtz Kay concludes: "We are not only stuck in traffic, we are stuck in spending money that promotes more of the same. By underpricing and oversubsidizing the automobile, the highway and sprawl, we have made this life style the overwhelming option and diminished the alternatives."

HEADLINE: At Long Last, Greece and Turkey Tiptoe Toward Reconciliation

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

DATELINE: ATHENS, July 18

 BODY:
By itself, the joint communique signed by Greece and Turkey at the recent NATO summit in Madrid amounts to a series of platitudes, including promises not to use force against each other and to observe existing treaties.
But in the context of a feverish relationship that had taken a turn for the worse in recent years, such language is being read as a breakthrough of sorts. According to Greek and foreign analysts, it may even be the start of a new discussion between countries whose history of mutual hostility has been one of NATO's most troublesome problems. 
 "It is substantial progress, because it allows us to meet," Greece's Foreign Minister, Theodoros Pangalos, said in an interview here. "It is the first signal of hope."
The communique, brokered by the United States and signed July 8 by Prime Minister Costas Simitis of Greece and President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey, comes a year and a half after the two nations seemed close to war over a couple of rocky islets in the eastern Aegean Sea, a few miles from the Turkish coast.
Those islets -- known as Imia to the Greeks and Kardak to the Turks -- are still in dispute, and the list of issues that divide Greece and Turkey is as long as ever, including the divided island of Cyprus and Greece's right to extend its continental shelf 12 miles into the Aegean Sea. Behind those questions lurk enmities that date back centuries, to the days when the Ottoman Turks occupied Greece.
But the Madrid communique did succeed in blunting the issue of the 12-mile limit, which Turkey no longer regards as a possible "cause for war."
As for the age-old animosities, there are Greek officials who will now openly discuss what was once unthinkable -- namely the cultural affinities that bind Turks and Greeks, despite the history that has divided them.
"Ironically, many people feel that Greece and Turkey could have common ground, notwithstanding their historical enmity," a foreign diplomat said. "Greece has had a terrible historical experience with Turkey, but they don't have any feelings of cultural or racial superiority."
For several months, there have been hints that the overheated atmosphere surrounding the Aegean crisis was beginning to cool. In Turkey, attention has centered on a domestic political drama, which ended this month with the collapse of the Government headed by Necmettin Erbakan, leader of a pro-Islamic party. He was replaced as Prime Minister by Mesut Yilmaz, leader of a center-right party with strong secularist and pro-European traditions.
Here in Greece, Mr. Simitis, the low-key successor to the flamboyantly combative Andreas Papandreou, has given Greek foreign policy a calmer tone, with a new stress on international cooperation.
"You have a mood that is different here, and that is really important," a foreign diplomat said. "There is a resolve to solve problems."
Since the death of Mr. Papandreou a year ago and Mr. Simitis's election, the new Government has made significant progress in improving its image and its relations with neighbors and allies.
It is still negotiating with the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia over the legal name for that country, but the nationalist fervor that once fed opposition to any sharing of the Macedonian name has virtually vanished.
"I want to get rid of this problem," Mr. Pangalos said, "because there is no substance to it."
The new tone has also spread to Greek-Turkish relations, which for Athens more than for Ankara, remains the top diplomatic priority.
A year ago, Mr. Pangalos was calling the Turks "international criminals" who lie like "fascists and Stalinists." Now, Mr. Pangalos talks of a future when, if certain conditions are met, Turkey will be "a very important partner" for Greece, and Greece will no longer provide camouflage for misgivings among other Europeans about letting Turkey into the European Union.
"There are other countries in the European Union that have other problems with Turkey and who are hiding behind my back," said Mr. Pangalos, pointing to his ample girth. "I have a big back, as you can see, but it can't cover all that crowd. I want them to come out and say what are the difficulties they have with Turkey, because they do have difficulties that are much more substantial than Greece has."
It was Mr. Pangalos who in March defended Turkey's "European vocation" after a group of European Christian Democrats issued a statement challenging the idea that a mostly Muslim country straddling the divide between Europe and Asia could be a valid candidate for membership in the European Union.
"I cannot accept this approach," Mr. Pangalos said. "Turkey is very much part of European history, and Islam is already part of Europe. The conditions for membership should be uniform, and based on whether a country meets the economic, social and political conditions required."
To its dismay, Turkey was not on the list of six countries recommended for European Union membership issued this week by the European Commission. But many analysts have concluded that in softening its position toward Greece, Turkey -- in particular the new Yilmaz Government -- has signaled a long-term diplomatic effort to win support in Europe.
Still, given the difficulties, few analysts expect quick results from the Madrid communique.
"We didn't solve any problems in Madrid," Mr. Pangalos said. "We established a framework to try to find ways to solve them. Maybe it will take 1, 2, 3 or 10 years. I don't know, but I suspect it will be a long process."

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Republican Shows Flair for Lead Role in Inquiry

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
As he sits and gently rocks at his committee chairman's post, Fred Thompson, the movie actor who became a senator and is now chief of the inquiry into campaign abuses, seems to be polishing the role of the avuncular partisan, the country sheriff with as sharp a sense of politics as of mission.
"Well, we're going to have an opportunity to have a little bipartisanship here right now," Mr. Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, announced last week in his rich baritone, stressing the line for its irony midway through the monthlong session of initial hearings. 
 A grin creased Mr. Thompson's usual expression of gruff courtliness, in recognition that bipartisanship is about as likely as a round of moonshine-sipping at the combative hearings of the Governmental Affairs Committee.
Handicapped by sparse television coverage, the Senator has had to develop his role before the inquiry's daily attendees, who look forward to his unscripted asides. These are often provoked by his designated nemesis, Senator John Glenn of Ohio, the ranking Democrat, who is getting rave reviews from his own party for peppering the proceedings with earnestly intoned objections. ("We're not just being fair and objective about this thing, Mr. Chairman.")
But the chairman is the chief player. Mr. Thompson's allegation of a brazen and illegal Chinese plot to buy into American politics promises to carry him toward the millennial Presidential race. But it is his more impassioned ad-libs that the audience savors. In these, the Senator seems braced by the inquiry's relentlessly partisan gamesmanship, and in fervid moments, he orates in a kind of senatorial Stengelese.
"I'm sure," Mr. Thompson said in one riposte to Mr. Glenn, "we will not get diverted down rabbit trails about concocting the most elaborate and sinister possible motive and because people who wag records over to some commercial person's office to brief them on because they don't know anything that went on wrong, that we should not be allowed to make ourselves -- to avail ourselves -- of all information that is available to us. And that's what we've done."
 
Seeking Testimony of Nuns
With the hearings devoid of telegenic moments, Republicans are aching to overcome an immunity dispute with the Justice Department so they can bring before the public four Buddhist nuns connected to a temple fund-raiser that Vice President Al Gore attended last year. The event, which involved John Huang, the zealous money-raiser for President Clinton and the center of Mr. Thompson's inquiry, can only embarrass the Democrats further if the committee hears testimony from the nuns, who were listed for $5,000 party contributions despite vows of poverty.
Michael J. Madigan, the committee's chief counsel, talked tantalizingly of having already deposed one of the nuns and finding out all about the temple fund-raiser from a most convincing witness. "The little nun herself," Mr. Madigan said, yearning to put her before the panel, "she's very, uh, she's very -- she's about 4-foot-10 and about 80, 90 pounds."
Nervous laughter rippled forward as Mr. Thompson rushed to keep his counsel within the bounds of political correctness. "Be careful, Mr. Madigan," he said. "Be careful."
 
An Eye-Catching Exhibit
Even as the Republicans try to target President Clinton, a politician who has already won his last big race, the subtext of the hearings burbles with mentions of Vice President Gore, a fellow Tennessean who could conceivably face off against Mr. Thompson in the next Presidential election. Thus the gleam in some Republican eyes when Exhibit 125 was introduced.
This was a letter to the Vice President's chief of staff, Jack Quinn, from Mr. Huang in 1993, when he worked in Los Angeles for the Riady family in their Lippo empire, which has business ties to the Chinese Government. He thanked Mr. Quinn for receiving him and Shen Jueren, chairman of China Resources, the commercial wing of the Chinese Government. "Vice President Gore was just super," Mr. Huang said in his letter, referring to another meeting three days later in Los Angeles.
Committee Republicans had that to-be-continued look.
 
Gingerly Defending Huang
The hardest task for committee Democrats has been to press for weaknesses in the Republican charge that Mr. Huang was an economic spy for foreign interests yet not come off as his partisan defense lawyers. Mr. Clinton's advice to the Democratic National Committee to hire Mr. Huang as a fund-raiser is now seen as a notoriously bad recommendation -- the committee has had to return half of the $3 million he raised for the President. The Democrats would rather take Mr. Huang for a fool than a spy.
"If he was a spy, if he was compromising our national security, isn't it curious that he would not only leave a paper trail, but a paper freeway of thousands of documents?" asked Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, citing voluminous committee exhibits.
Republicans focused suspicion on the fact that Mr. Huang, as a Commerce Department official, was in touch with the Chinese Embassy. But Mr. Durbin countered that this had been a reasonable part of Mr. Huang's department rounds and that he had openly put taxi rides to and from the embassy on his Government expense account. "This man, if he'd taken the time to read one John LeCarre book, would not have done some of the things that you're alleging he's done," Mr. Durbin said.
 
Outrage Over Absentees
For all the Democrats' gloating about the paucity of hard evidence of fresh scandal so far, there is no way they can avoid Republicans' complaints that any weakness in the hearings is rooted in the absence of crucial witnesses who richly supported Mr. Clinton's re-election and were once honored in his presence. These include Mr. Huang, who is seeking at least partial immunity from criminal prosecution; the Riadys, whose ties to Mr. Clinton go back to his days as Governor of Arkansas, and a half-dozen other big-money supporters who are reported to be in Asia and elsewhere and have shown no inclination to testify.
"If Ms. Kanchanalak and Mr. Hubbell and Mr. Middleton and a few others weren't either hiding somewhere outside this country or taking the Fifth Amendment, we might have more amplification," Senator Robert C. Smith, Republican of New Hampshire, told the Democrats, citing a few of the missing figures, Pauline Kanchanalak, Webster L. Hubbell and Mark E. Middleton.
Democrats took care to concede the point on the record. One, Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, said: "Whatever outrage we have felt about other issues or differences does not begin to compare with our outrage with people who have escaped the subpoenas of this committee or continue to avoid participating and cooperating."
 
More Rehearsing Needed
In the inquiry spotlight, the unrehearsed words of committee members can go awry. On opening day, Senator Sam Brownback, Republican of Kansas, could be seen silently practicing some phrases and gestures of emphasis for his initial speech, which he delivered forcefully. Later, however, when questioning a witness about Mr. Huang's bonus arrangement in fund-raising for the Democrats, Mr. Brownback said, "No raise money, no get bonus." A sudden hush was discernible in parts of the audience, and just as suddenly, Mr. Brownback, wary of intimations of an ethnic slur, said, "No slight by my statement previously."

Indonesian Balancing Act

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia

 BODY:
When all is said and done the Clinton foreign policy is going to be judged very heavily by how well it manages the two great historical transitions now under way: the decline of Russia and the rise of China. For now, Russia's decline is going relatively well (thanks to Boris), but the rise of China is another matter. It's critical that China's rise at the close of this century be handled better than Japan's rise at the start of this century, since Japan's emergence as a powerhouse led to three wars in Asia.
But there's no way the U.S. can manage the rise of China alone, or even with Japan. And that brings me to Indonesia. Indonesia has played one of the most important, but least understood, roles in managing China's rise. This is not only because with its 200 million people Indonesia is second only to China in weight in Southeast Asia, but also because Indonesia is the keystone of the Association of South East Asian Nations (Asean). Asean isn't NATO or the E.U., but it does a pretty fair imitation of both. 
 And Asean, which next week celebrates its 30th anniversary, would never have been created without Indonesia and without the policy President Suharto initiated when he took power from President Sukarno in 1965. Mr. Sukarno believed in an Indonesia that bullied its neighbors, sparking constant disputes. Mr. Suharto preferred to do business with them instead, while focusing on Indonesia's internal development. So he formed Asean, as an economic-trade association, comprising Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand and Brunei, and he transformed Indonesia's foreign policy from bully to gentle giant. Indonesia today has a defense budget two-thirds that of tiny Singapore.
"Ever since Asean was formed this region has entered into an unprecedented period of stability and economic growth," Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, said to me. "And I think it's not too much to say that Asean was formed because of Indonesia -- because a new Government came in which renounced the earlier policy of throwing our weight around."
Asean was also a de facto security alliance, designed originally to block Communism from Hanoi. But in the last decade Asean quietly shifted from balancing North Vietnam to balancing China (and Japan). That transition was formalized last year when Vietnam -- the most powerful and historically anti-Chinese force in Southeast Asia -- was added to Asean. This year Asean is adding the remaining loose pawns on the chess board before they fall too heavily under China's sway, namely Burma, Laos and Cambodia (if it gets its house in order).
China's Asia strategy is to deal with everyone bilaterally so that China's weight can be used to maximum advantage. This is particularly true when pressing China's claims to oil fields in the South China Sea that are also claimed by Asean members. But Asean, by using solidarity as a substitute for military power, has forced China to deal with its members as a group. So when the Philippines found itself in a dispute with China over the oil-rich Mischief Reef, Asean stood behind the Philippines and swayed China into a dialogue on the issue. It helps too that Asean nations are among the biggest investors in China.
"Although strategically Asean is not a cohesive military entity, China cannot challenge any one of these states without having a problem with all of them," said Juwono Sudarsono, Indonesia's leading strategic analyst. "And, as long as China's internal economic problem is so massive, it can't just assert its military might unilaterally. It needs the good will and investment of its neighbors" -- particularly Indonesia, which controls the straits through which a growing China will soon have to import tons of oil from the Middle East.
With Asean, Japan and the U.S. Seventh Fleet each balancing China in its own way, the world stands a much better chance of seeing an emerging China that settles regional disputes through dialogue, not force.
But there's no Asean without Indonesia. The U.S. has some real problems with Indonesia today on labor and human rights. America cannot ignore Indonesia's abuses. But they also can't be the only lens through which Indonesia is judged. The best U.S. policy here would be one that carefully targets -- and when necessary sanctions -- specific Indonesian domestic abuses, while also supporting Indonesian foreign policies that have contributed so heavily to stability in this region. Without an effective Indonesia policy, the U.S. will never have an effective China policy.

For Giants, Offensive Line Is Still Evolving

BYLINE: By BILL PENNINGTON 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 20

 BODY:
One of the first things Jim Fassel did after he was hired to coach the Giants was watch a hit horror film.
It was a compilation of all the 1996 sacks and knockdowns of quarterback Dave Brown. 
 "It was brutal," Fassel said. "People have been talking to me about what I can do to make Dave a better quarterback. The biggest thing I can do is get him better protection."
So if keeping the quarterback upright is such a priority, then why is the makeup of the Giants' offensive line still a mystery?
A piece of the offensive line puzzle may fall into place Monday, when Lance Smith, an unrestricted free agent who started at left guard last season, may report to camp. People familiar with contract negotiations between Smith and the Giants said today that an understanding between them was nearly complete. Smith's arrival would hardly resolve the offensive line picture, but it would certainly give Fassel more options.
For Smith, 34, the first assignment would be winning back his starting spot. In his absence, Fassel has promoted Roman Oben, a second-year player with limited pro experience, to left tackle and moved Greg Bishop, who started at left tackle last season, back to his more natural position of left guard, where he played in 1995.
The picture will get more confused when Smith returns and Bishop begins competing simultaneously with Oben at tackle and Smith at guard.
The resolution could rest on Oben, who, except for a handful of plays, has played only on the Giants' field-goal team.
If he can do a dependable job at left tackle, then Smith, a 12-year veteran, could play guard and Bishop could back up both. If Bishop wins the spot at left guard, the Giants will be overloaded with linemen, including Rob Zatechka and Jerry Reynolds.
But starting Oben would be a big gamble for the Giants. Brown was the most-sacked quarterback in the National Football League last season, in part because Bishop -- protecting the quarterback's blind side -- was often beaten by speedy pass rushers. Can the Giants afford to place Brown's health and well-being on the limited experience of the 24-year-old Oben, who has played in two games?
 "I would be comfortable going into the season with Roman at left tackle," Fassel said. "He's looked great in camp so far."
The Giants like Oben's quick feet, an asset in pass blocking. Although he is 6 feet 4 inches and 310 pounds, he somehow appears compact and less bulky than his massive contemporaries on the offensive line. A star at Louisville, where he earned a degree in economics, Oben might have been rated a first-round pick had he been drafted after his junior season, when he excelled. Some pro scouts considered Oben's senior season disappointing.
When left tackle Jumbo Elliott left the Giants for the Jets, Oben became a natural choice to replace him.
"It's an opportunity for me," Oben said today between practice sessions on the SUNY-Albany campus. "Lance Smith is a good player, and I want to see him back.
"But I have to know that this is my chance to get better."
Oben's responsibilities may be easier than Bishop's were a year ago. Watching the Giants practice this weekend, it has become obvious that Fassel's offense plans to limit Brown's time in the pocket. Fassel relies on quick passes and short drops and, at times, he seems eager to move Brown away from potential pass-rushing pressure.
This is good news for Oben, not to mention Brown.
"Dave just can't be expected to take the pounding he has and still perform," Fassel said. "That has to change."

EXTRA POINTS
Linebacker MARCUS BUCKLEY sprained his left ankle in Sunday's afternoon practice; the rookie tight end BRANDON JESSIE partially dislocated his left shoulder, and cornerback MARC WILLIAMS strained his right hamstring. Punter BRAD MAYNARD, who sat out the morning practice with a sore left hamstring, resumed punting in the afternoon.

America the Beautiful? (A Rare Rave)

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: BEIJING, July 19

 BODY:
At a time when many of the best-selling books in China promote the idea of standing up to America or other forms of chest-thumping to herald China's rise as a great power, one author has returned from a long sojourn in the United States to testify that it is a fairly normal place, a land of great opportunity, deliciously free and full of "real people."
Qian Ning's "Studying in America" is not a sentimental paean, but an objective chronicle of the lives of Chinese students who have become a significant presence on almost every university campus in the nation that is known in Chinese as "Meiguo," or "beautiful country." 
 "My first impression when I arrived in Ann Arbor was the singing, the laughter and the smell of barbecue at parties on the campus I saw that evening," wrote Mr. Qian of his first day at the University of Michigan. It was August 1989, just weeks after he had witnessed the large pro-democracy demonstrations at Tiananmen Square and the military crackdown that led to the massacre of hundreds of unarmed students and workers by Chinese troops.
"This world in front of my eyes was so different from the world on Tiananmen Square, that it was impossible to connect them together in my mind," he continued. "But at that moment, I understood a simple thing. We Chinese -- at least the younger generation of Chinese -- can have a different kind of life, free from the repetitious political movements in the past and life-and-death struggles."
No one would call Mr. Qian a political dissident or firebrand. In simple and elegant terms, much the same as those used by Alexis de Tocqueville to describe the early United States to Europeans, the 37-year-old Mr. Qian seems to undermine the rancorous literature of Chinese nationalism.
Having left China troubled and confused eight years ago, he described the United States he found and the Chinese he encountered there. Among them was a visiting scholar who was having difficulty coping with freedom after years of regimented life in China. "Here nobody controls you, but nobody cares about you," he told Mr. Qian.
There are stories of Chinese who became millionaires in the United States but who are still haunted by the persecutions they suffered in China under Mao, and there are stories of those who failed to assimilate or struggled against the anxiety, insecurity and deprivation of an immigrant class.
One student in economics arrived from China on a one-year scholarship and described his "sense of being an elite." Initially sought out by his American colleagues to lecture on the Chinese economy at university seminars, he discovered a different side of life in a capitalist society when he had to find a way to support himself.
"When his scholarship ran out, he found out how miserable and tiny he was," Mr. Qian writes. The visiting scholar took a job in a restaurant cutting up chickens into breasts, legs and wings and "all his elite sense was lost."
Mr. Qian's book, which was published last winter, is exceptional not only because it offers millions of Chinese readers an objective antidote to the nationalistic streak that has infected Chinese literature, but also because it carries the authority of Mr. Qian's family background. He is the son of Qian Qichen, who is China's Foreign Minister and a Deputy Prime Minister.
Like many of the 250,000 students -- China's best and brightest -- who have traveled to the United States in the last two decades, the younger Mr. Qian experienced the metamorphosis of a child who grew up during China's most turbulent decade -- the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution -- only to discover a different reality outside China.
"Chinese students who went to America had simple but firm beliefs that their leaders should control the people," he said. "We thought that the values and standards in our society were only natural and absolute. It was only when we got into another society that we realized the limitation of our own ideology.
"My impression after arriving in the United States was, 'Wow, who would have thought that a man could live this way!' "
With books like "China Can Say No," and "The Demonization of China," the state-controlled publishing industry and a number of opportunistic authors, most of whom have never visited the United States, have attempted to cash in on popular sentiments and Communist Party pronouncements that the United States, Britain and the West in general are seeking to "contain" or restrain China's emergence on the world stage.
Mr. Qian's writing rejects this view of the United States in favor of a more empirical study of how Chinese students have been discovering the land they have read so much about since Deng Xiaoping, the late paramount leader of China, picked America as the country that was essential to China's modernization.
Sipping coffee in a hotel lobby in Beijing, to which he returned in 1995 to become a consultant to the American accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand, Mr. Qian explained his view of the complicated state of relations between China and the United States.
"I think that in China, as well as in America, there is a gap between what the politicians say about each others' country, and what the people think," he said. "I would have to say that when you look at a newspaper here, maybe you will find a lot of criticism of one thing or another about the West, but people here do not take it very seriously; they know this is the official culture. When you look at China -- or America -- what is more important is the real of life of the people."
Most Chinese, he said, do not share the critical view of the United States that is expounded by Communist Party propagandists. And he does not believe that Chinese and Western civilizations are fated to clash.
"I don't go along with this theory," he said. "A lot of Chinese in the United States have adapted to the American life style without much effort. I think the trouble is caused by ideology. It is not really cultures that are clashing, it is ideology that is clashing, or politics, and that is understandable."
Still, Mr. Qian says that the average Chinese has done more to try to understand the United States than the average American has done to understand China.
"We are at a different stage of development," he said, and therefore many Chinese look to the United States as a role model for China's modernization.
"Maybe we can avoid some of the mistakes that America has made, but very few Americans really get a chance to learn a lot about China," he said.
Mr. Qian returned to China flush with optimism that he can contribute to China's transformation to something better by working for its economic development.
He avoids the political implications of this goal, but the subtext of what he says is a powerful message to China's leaders that the coming generation has already rejected the ideology of their elders and that freedom, much more of it than now exists, is high on its agenda.

BYLINE: By KATE MURPHY 

 BODY:
Working cattle at the Decatur County Feedyard in Oberlin, Kan., has always been a complex craft. But there was a simplicity to some jobs, like inoculations. "We used to hold them in the shoot, give them their vaccination and then kick them out," explained the head cowboy, James L. Fortin.
Today things are different. Using a large variety of electronic equipment, Mr. Fortin now takes detailed records identifying each animal and collecting data about its size and health, to determine the amount of food and medicine it needs. "They call me the ultrasound man, now," Mr. Fortin said. 
 Technology is transforming the cattle and dairy industries. Competitive pressures, high feed costs and the demand for prime, specialty beef have forced more farmers and ranchers to drive their herds into the electronic frontier.
Cowboy gear may now include electronic scanners along with the more predictable ropes, chaps and pocket knives. The scanners collect identifying data from the electronic ear tags that, when downloaded into laptop computers, automatically calls up each cow's family and medical history.
A slightly different sort of scanner is also mounted on the doors of dairy barns to read which cows come in to be milked. "The technology allows tracking," from calf to carcass, "which is the first step toward herd improvement," said David C. Warren, president of Allflex USA Inc., a privately held Dallas manufacturer of electronic animal identification devices.
None of the experts in cattlemen's professional organizations, Federal or state agencies or universities can say for sure how many of the nation's 87.8 million beef cattle and 9.3 million dairy cows are raised with electronic aids. But technology is clearly making inroads in a business whose reliance on physical skill and intuition have made it a metaphor for the American experience.
Still, whatever the folklore surrounding them, cattle are a business proposition. Tracking them through their lives to determine how to produce the food Americans want is crucial to improving profit margins. Historical information can explain why one animal in a herd fetched top dollar for its prime cuts while another ended up as ground chuck -- or why one cow yields butterfat-rich milk while another does not.
The results can mean as much as a $300 difference in the value of an animal. On average -- and the averages reflect significant annual fluctuations in price -- a single head of cattle, which usually weighs between 1,000 and 1,300 pounds, now sells for 64 cents a pound, according to Cattle Fax Inc., a private research company based in Englewood, Colo.
"There are so many things, from genetics to type of feed, that can make a difference," said Warren Weibert, owner and general manager of the Decatur County Feedyard, one of the most technologically sophisticated agricultural operations in the country.
Mr. Weibert's yard fattens 24,000 cattle for slaughter every six months. For the last three years, he has electronically tagged 15,000 to identify what factors contribute to production of the uniform, high-quality product that meat processors seek.
Raising cattle to suit the market's taste has become more crucial since Americans have become increasingly health conscious, looking askance at everything from whole milk to hamburger. But even though overall meat consumption has declined in the last decade, demand for prime grade cuts has risen.
"Cattle producers' goal nowadays is to come up with those higher grades that consumers have demonstrated they will pay higher prices for," said Chuck Lambert, chief economist with the National Cattlemen's Beef Association in Washington, D.C. The cattle industry generated $50 billion in retail sales last year.
Decatur is one of a handful of feedlots in the United States that has installed $150,000 to $250,000 systems like Amarillo, Tex.-based Micro Chemical Inc.'s Accu-Trac to electronically monitor their cattle. In fact, according to Rod Fee, the livestock editor of Successful Farming, buying such a system makes sense only if an operation's herd exceeds 15,000 head.
Central to the system are electronic ear tags that trip sensors that record how often and how much animals eat. An electronic tag cost $10; the hand-held scanners, between $3,400 and $4,000.
Veterinarians scan the tags to chronicle the immunizations and medicines they administer. Computerized scales and electronic eyes track cows' weight and height. Feedlot owners -- who buy 500-pound calves from the "cow-calf" operations and sell mature animals to the slaughterhouses -- create digitized ultrasonic images of cattle to determine leanness and marbling of their meat.
"You can imagine how helpful that can be when the price of feed hits the ceiling like it did last year," Mr. Fee said. "If the ultrasound picks up a lot of excess fat, you know that animal's getting too much feed."
Mr. Weibert said his profits rose an average $20 for each electronically monitored head last year, compared with the previous year.
In addition to helping with management decisions at the feedlot level, electronic monitoring makes it possible to inform the million or so cattle operations that supply the country's approximately 39,000 feedlots about the animals they breed. "They get back that final carcass data and can make some genetic corrections," said Walter Koers, president of Koers Turgeon Consulting Services Inc., a consulting firm in Salina, Kan.
In the past, those running the farms where calves are born and raised -- before feedlots get them -- had little idea what kind of beef their animals produced. "Getting that information is the key to breeding better animals," Mr. Koers said.
"We're moving closer to making electronic tagging a requirement because of the ability to track cows all the way back to the beginning," said William C. Wagner, who runs veterinary medicine programs at the Department of Agriculture's Cooperative Extension Service in Washington. Such records could help combat outbreaks of disease.
Electronic monitoring is already common in the $22.8 billion dairy industry. Electronic sensors are a standard feature on milking equipment. The sensor notes when tagged cows enter the milking parlor and hitch up to a machine. As the milk begins to flow, sensors on the milking machines record how much milk a cow produces, its fat content and the milk's white blood cell count -- a clue to the animal's health.
A third of all dairy farmers send this information by modem to a data base in Beltsville, Md., operated by the Department of Agriculture's Dairy Herd Improvement Association. The data are compiled and analyzed there, with the results returned to farmers.
Another sensor, implanted in a cow's hindquarters, alerts farmers when the cow allows other cows to mount her -- signaling the start of her 6- to 12-hour period of maximum fertility. Milk production is initiated by hormonal changes, so "You can't milk if you don't calf," said David Forgey, who owns and operates a 112-head dairy farm in Logansport, Ind.
For the last year, he has used Heatwatch sensors manufactured by DDx Inc. of Denver, which have improved his reproduction rate and consequent milking yield by 25 percent. The basic system costs $3,000; the sensors are $55 apiece.
The majority of the 250 or more companies creating software that run such systems are small businesses started by farmers who either gave up or had their farms foreclosed during the downturns in the volatile business.
"I got squeezed out so I got into software," said Norman Teegardin, a former grain farmer who now owns CTN Data Service Inc., which manufacturers FarmWorks livestock and crop management software in Hamilton, Ind. University based agriculture extension services also sell software like the University of Minnesota's popular DairyChamp program.
But there are no dominant players in this category yet, said Darrin Drollinger, general manager of the Agricultural Electronic Association, a Chicago-based trade group. "There are definitely no Microsofts," he said. That's because the market remains, for the most part, resistant to change, according to Bill Turner, professor of beef cattle science at Texas A & M University in College Station, Tex.
"For old boys running cows out on the range, high technology is a pickup truck," Mr. Turner said.

Chart: "High Tech Down on the Farm"
About 4.5 million of the nation's 9.3 million dairy cows -- and their milk -- are monitored electronically, with the data analyzed by the Dairy Herd Improvement Association. Now, electronic monitoring is coming to beef cattle, as ranchers seek to improve meat quality. Here are a few examples from both.
 
Electronic Branding
A tag attached to a cow's ear identifies it throughout its life.
 
Weight
The cattle can be weighed before and after feeding, to tell if it is getting too fat or too thin.
 
Height
Sensors can be placed at barn doorways identifying the cattle by their tags and measuring their height.
 
Eating
Food in the trough can be weighed before and after feeding to track how much is consumed.
 
Slaughter
Before cattle are slaughtered, their ear tags can be scanned again. The ranchers who raised the animals can check on which animals yielded the highest quality beef.
 
Health
By scanning the ear tag on a sick cow, veterinarians can gain access to its medical history.
 
Dairy
Before dairy cows give milk, their tags can be scanned. The milk can then be analyzed; total output and nutritional content are recorded.

HEADLINE: With Times Square Reborn, Attention Turns to Coney Island

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Inspired by the success of efforts to redevelop Times Square, private investors and state officials are now turning their attention to another long-neglected part of New York City: Coney Island.
The efforts have gained new momentum in recent weeks because Bruce C. Ratner, a developer with a proven track record in several large projects, has shown interest in Coney Island. Mr. Ratner's most notable project so far is the Metrotech office complex, which has been credited with reviving downtown Brooklyn. 
 Coney Island, perhaps more than any other address in New York, most approaches the historical flamboyance and cachet of Times Square -- and still retains a mythic reputation as a land of roller coasters, snake handlers and other amusements. But the reality is much grimmer: The amusement area has shrunk to 3 blocks in length from 20 blocks in the 1940's, and much of the land abandoned by amusements lies vacant.
Mr. Ratner's proposal, which involves a private investment of $100 million, is to link a new multiplex theater and virtual-reality amusement park with a decade-old plan for an amateur sports center that would be built with money from state bonds.
For Mr. Ratner's proposal to go forward, he would have to acquire the land from the city, which now owns it. The plan must also pass environmental and zoning reviews, a process that could take several years. But state officials said they believed that Mr. Ratner's proposal complied with zoning rules for the Coney Island area.
Mr. Ratner has refused to comment publicly on his proposal. But Charles A. Gargano, the chairman of the Empire State Development Corporation, a major player in Times Square, said that the state was committed to redevelopment of the area and that Mr. Ratner's involvement was a major boost for these efforts. He added that he had spoken to other developers who he said also thought that such a Coney Island project would work, and that he and the Governor had had "many discussions" recently about Coney Island.
"If we can rebuild 42d Street, we can certainly rebuild Coney Island," Mr. Gargano said. "What it needs is some investment."
The current discussion is linked to the status of Sportsplex, a proposed 12,300-seat indoor athletic center that would be in the old Steeplechase Park amusement area -- once the centerpiece of Coney Island. Financing for Sportsplex is part of the current budget negotiations in Albany and would require $75 million in bonds from the state; the Legislature has failed to approve the proposal for the last two years. State officials say Mr. Ratner's project is based upon approval of Sportsplex.
Mr. Gargano said the project's prospects were sweeter this year because of Mr. Ratner's proposal and because of several other developers' interest in commercial developments to accompany the arena.
Mr. Gargano pledged state help with transportation and other infrastructure improvements, as well as aid in acquiring private land. He said Gov. George E. Pataki, who he said supports Sportsplex, is eager to prod development of Coney Island, regardless of whether Sportsplex goes ahead.
"Sportsplex would be a good part of it, but it doesn't have to be," Mr. Gargano said. "There wasn't one of those when Coney Island was booming."
Nevertheless, development efforts face many obstacles, not the least of which is that, unlike Times Square, Coney Island is far away from the main stomping grounds of tourists. Also, its main attraction in the early part of the century -- the beach -- is not the draw it once was, since automobiles have made places like Jones Beach and other spots easily accessible.
Furthermore, the current redevelopment efforts are predicated on a combined public-private effort, and the decades-long effort to improve Times Square showed how difficult these efforts can be.
Caroline Quartararo, a spokeswoman for the Empire State Development Corporation, the state economic development agency, said she believed that the project would pass environmental and zoning reviews, adding, "When the public sector gets involved, it reduces unnecessary roadblocks for the private sector."
So far, only Mr. Ratner has put forth a concrete proposal, but other developers agree the time may be right for a showy commercial development in Coney Island, particularly if it is accompanied by the sort of governmental aid Times Square received. There, the state spent $75 million, largely in condemnation proceedings, to stimulate $1.6 billion in private expenditures.
"We believe it's a ripe area for development," said Philip Wolf, who is overseeing the building of Brooklyn's first new hotel in 50 years for the Muss Development Company in the borough's downtown area. "It could be terrific."
Lewis Rudin, a leading real estate developer and chairman of the Association for a Better New York, suggested that what he termed "a modern-day entertainment center" could redirect Brooklynites' recreational patterns. "There are 2.4 million people in Brooklyn, and they don't all go to Times Square," he said. "They'll turn their cars around and head south."
The backers of Sportsplex asked Mr. Ratner to do a business analysis of the area around Sportsplex's proposed site. Mr. Gargano had suggested that such an analysis was likely to make the project more attractive to the Governor.
The developer returned with a full-scale development proposal, which foundation officials and their consultants say he has already submitted to the city.
The details of his proposal were contained in an economic analysis conducted by TAMS Consultants Inc. The proposal involves a more than 400,000-square-foot entertainment and retail complex to stretch from 15th to 19th Streets. It would include the sort of electronic games now popular in Times Square, and it would partly occupy land presently occupied by the skeleton of the Thunderbolt roller coaster, which closed in 1983. It would generate more than 1,000 construction jobs and more than 300 permanent jobs, TAMS said.
Andrew Parker, a principal of the consulting firm, said his and Mr. Ratner's own analysis assumed no subsidies, other than being given vacant land owned by the city. TAMS calculated that the project would generate $12.1 million in new annual tax revenues for the city and $9.5 million for the state after subtracting $4.8 million a year in debt service on state-backed bonds.
Mr. Ratner, a major contributor to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, has also been involved in the redevelopment of the Times Square area and developed the Atlantic Center mall project in Brooklyn.
The Sportsplex project is a 262,000-square-foot facility where 12,300 spectators could watch basketball games, track meets and other indoor athletic events.
Backers say there are only 54 public gyms in Brooklyn, a borough that is home to an estimated 600,000 amateur athletes, some of whom practice track events in school hallways. In addition, there is no athletic venue in Brooklyn with more than St. Francis University's 1,800 seats.
Because there are so few venues between Madison Square Garden and small high school gyms, school officials said Sportsplex would attract athletes from beyond Brooklyn.
"We don't see it as a Brooklyn facility; we see it as a citywide facility," said William C. Thompson, president of the Board of Education, which has pledged to pay $1 for each student using Sportsplex. Brooklyn colleges have promised $2 a user.
Sportsplex planners also hope to rent the center for events as varied as business conventions and ethnic festivals.
They have also discussed possible bookings with the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, the Harlem Globetrotters and organizers of professional wresting and tractor pulls and other events they see very much in the tradition of Coney Island's raucous show business heritage. They calculate that rent from such events, expected to take up only 9 percent of Sportsplex's bookings, would more than cover the center's estimated $2.5 million annual operating cost.

Philippines to Get Emergency I.M.F. Loan
In an important test of new methods to cope with instability in world financial markets, the International Monetary Fund has for the first time used emergency procedures set up after the Mexican financial crisis to arrange an urgent loan of $1 billion to the Philippines.
The move was an unusual response to the pressure placed on some other Southeast Asian economies since Thailand was forced on July 2 to devalue its currency. [Page A1.] 

New Cap Near for Outpatient Bills
Relief is in sight for elderly people who, in recent years, have been forced to pay a large and rapidly growing share of the bills for hospital outpatient services like cataract surgery, hernia operations and all sorts of diagnostic tests. The budget bill moving through Congress would impose new limits on what Medicare beneficiaries pay for such services. [A1.]
 
At the Silicon Ranch
Technology is transforming the cattle and dairy industries. Competitive pressures, high feed costs and the demand for prime, specialty beef have forced more farmers and ranchers to drive their herds into the electronic frontier. Perhaps it was inevitable when cows started appearing on those Gateway 2000 boxes. [D4.]

Intel Settles Suit Over Chips
Intel has settled a class-action suit brought in the wake of the disclosure last year that an error in a testing process had led the company to overstate the speed of some microprocessor chips by about 10 percent. The chip maker will offer rebates on the purchase of new processors for some customers and add new language warning computer users to carefully assess comparisons of processor speed. [D6.]
 
A Loud Battle in Audio Systems
A war is under way for control of the music and the video soundtracks Americans play in their living rooms.

HEADLINE: To Ease Crisis, I.M.F. Makes Philippines Emergency Loan

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 20

 BODY:
In an important test of new methods to cope with instability in world financial markets, the International Monetary Fund has for the first time used emergency procedures set up after the Mexican economic crisis to arrange a $1 billion loan to the Philippines.
The move was an unusual response to the pressure placed on some other Southeast Asian economies since Thailand was forced on July 2 to devalue its currency. On Friday, officials of the fund said today, its board approved a special loan request from Manila to help its central bank shore up the value of the Philippine peso, which was allowed to float on July 11 and has since lost 12 percent of its value. 
 Though the loan is small in comparison with an unprecedented $17.8 billion that the fund lent Mexico in February 1995, the instability of some Southeast Asian economies has been worrisome to international institutions like the I.M.F. and to the United States Government.
The Mexico crisis of 1994-95 provided further evidence to world financial authorities that global markets are tightly linked, and that instability even in smaller emerging markets can be sufficient to disrupt financial centers like those of New York and London.
During the Mexican crisis, world financial institutions were criticized for not moving fast enough. This helped lead to the establishment of emergency procedures that were put to their first test late last week.
"It's a very good thing that's happened," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "This is the first sequence of financial disruptions since the Mexico crisis that has radiated out from one country to a financial contagion affecting lots of other countries. It's imperative that the I.M.F. be able to deal with these crises very fast and demonstrate that to the markets. And the Philippines deserves a lot of credit for going to the fund quickly to seek help. So both sides have learned, and hopefully this will help mitigate any spillover of the contagion."
The International Monetary Fund's board approved Manila's request to draw on $600 million from an existing loan program that was due to expire on Wednesday. It extended that loan through the end of this year, and augmented it with a further credit line of $435 million. The credit is expected to help Manila defend the peso and build up its reserves, after its central bank had spent about $1 billion trying -- and failing -- to support the currency's earlier fixed rate of exchange against the dollar, fund officials said.
Manila's request was approved within a week, an extremely quick turnaround, under the fund's Emergency Financial Mechanism set up in September 1995.
While a senior fund official said that the Philippines qualified for the new credits under normal criteria, "it was a good occasion to try out these new procedures," made easier because fund officials were already in Manila negotiating a review of the Philippines' current I.M.F. loan program. Normally, it takes the fund at least six weeks to approve a credit request, the official said.
Two years ago, at a meeting of top leaders of the Group of Seven industrial nations in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the American Secretary of the Treasury, Robert E. Rubin, persuaded representatives of other nations to set up funds within the I.M.F. for emergencies, so that loans would not be entirely dependent on American financing that would require Congressional approval.
The pressure on the Philippines, as on other fast-growing countries in Southeast Asia, was a consequence of a slowdown in exports; the strength of the dollar against the Japanese yen, which made their own currencies stronger against the yen as well, and deepening troubles in Thailand's economy. There, an overheated real estate market led banks and their customers to invest heavily in what proved to be bad projects, borrowing from Japanese and American lenders to do so.
There had been a reluctance to devalue the Thai currency, the baht, which was fixed to the dollar, because it would make those loans more expensive to repay. As a result, fund officials said, the Thais waited too long to devaluate the baht in order to make their exports more competitive.
Currency speculators, however, put pressure on the baht and finally forced Thailand to give in on July 2 and allow the currency to float. Speculators then took aim at the currencies of Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore, as well as the Philippines, the weakest of these economies.
In return for the new credits, the Philippine Government agreed to continue to keep interest rates high, reduce inflation to 6.5 percent in 1997 from 8.4 percent last year, keep its budget deficit to 4.5 percent of the gross national product and try to pass the rest of a tax-reform package. It also pledged to tighten the exposure of banks to real estate markets, which set off the crisis in Thailand. The fund expects the Philippine economy to grow this year by 6.3 percent, up from 5.7 percent in 1996.
I.M.F. officials noted that the analogy of Southeast Asia to Mexico is not precise, and that the economies of the Southeast Asian nations -- especially Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore -- are fundamentally sound, with strong growth. These countries, as well as Thailand, in many respects already have the kinds of dynamic economies that Mexico is trying to develop.
While Thailand does not have a loan program with the I.M.F. and says it does not want one, its Finance Minister visited Japan last week. But he did not, as expected, ask for a loan, because the Japanese are said to have made clear that no money would be forthcoming unless Thailand first approached the I.M.F.

HEADLINE: Lilco's Hard Journey

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 20

 BODY:
The State of New York finally agreed to a takeover of most of the Long Island Lighting Company last week, but the fate of the company may have been sealed on March 28, 1979.
On that day, the cooling systems at a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania failed, a reactor overheated, plutonium fuel rods melted, mounting pressure threatened to burst the concrete shell and radioactive steam and water were released to prevent an explosion. The plant, Three Mile Island, became synonymous with the dangers of nuclear power. 
 The accident galvanized local opposition to the Shoreham nuclear plant, then under construction on the North Shore of Long Island, and that opposition prevented Lilco from putting the plant into service. The accident at Three Mile Island also resulted in new safety requirements for nuclear plants, pushing the cost of Shoreham sharply higher. The utility spent $5.5 billion on an investment it could not use, forcing it to buy power elsewhere, causing electric rates on the island to balloon and leaving the company staggering under its debt.
State officials have been searching for more than a decade for some way to lower Long Island's electric rates, which are more than double the national average. And for more than a decade, state officials assigned to solve the problem have concluded that the answer was a state buyout.
Indeed, despite years of pitched political battles and position reversals by key players, including Gov. George E. Pataki, the agreement approved last week by the state's Public Authorities Control Board had about it the air of inevitability.
"It had to happen," said Frank G. Zarb, until recently the chairman of Long Island Power Authority, the state agency that will effect the takeover. "It was just a matter of time."
The Power Authority plans to borrow $7.3 billion to buy Lilco's transmission and distribution system and to take over its debts. Lilco, which is merging with the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, will keep its power plants, though the power authority will have the option of buying them in a few years. The deal still must be approved by several Federal agencies.
The control board promised that rates would average at least 14 percent below current levels for the next 10 years; the administration says it will be 19 percent.
The savings would derive from three basic factors: The state agency can borrow through tax-exempt bonds, refinancing Lilco's debts at a low interest rate; the authority does not have to pay income taxes, as Lilco does, and it does not have shareholders to whom it must pay dividends.
A public buyout has been part of the Lilco debate for more than a decade, though each new set of public officials to enter the fray had to take up and discard other options before arriving at that one.
In the mid-1980's, Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse M. D'Amato obtained a Long Island exemption to a Federal law that barred the use of tax-exempt bonds to refinance utility debts. In 1986, the state created the Long Island Power Authority specifically for the purpose of taking over Shoreham or other Lilco assets, or even the whole company.
"The surprise is that it took this long, and that it's a Republican governor who's doing it," said Gordian Raacke, executive director of the Citizens Advisory Panel to Lilco, which was appointed by a Federal court as part of a lawsuit against the utility in the 1980's. Mr. Raacke is critical of the deal, though not of the takeover notion in general.
The Power Authority made unsuccessful offers for the company in 1988, though they were meant primarily to prod Lilco into giving up Shoreham, which it turned over the state the next year.
"In the beginning, nobody wanted to see a friendly takeover," said Richard M. Kessel, the chairman of the Power Authority and a member of its board since it was created. "Seizing it by eminent domain, maybe. But we tried our best to look at every other alternative, and we had to conclude that this was the only way to go."
So what took so long?
"The notion that government should somehow undertake a massive thing like this turned off a lot of people," said Mr. Kessel, a Democrat. "And for years, everybody was preoccupied with closing Shoreham. But mostly, people hate the company, and that gets in the way of everything. Any solution means making a deal with the company, and the passions are so huge, it's hard to get people to understand that. It took me a long time to cross that bridge."
Mr. Zarb gave a shorter answer: "Politics."
Takeover bids under Governor Mario M. Cuomo met with stiff opposition from Republicans in the Legislature.
"The Republicans stopped it," Mr. Cuomo said. "Ask them why it didn't happen earlier."
In October 1994, locked in a desperate race for governor against Mr. Pataki, Mr. Cuomo proposed a complete takeover of Lilco. Some important details were different, but in its broad outlines, it was much the same plan that Mr. Pataki proposed two and a half years later.
But at the time, Mr. Pataki derided the idea as a cynical attempt to buy Long Island votes, and as a misguided, big-money initiative typical of the Democrats, and discarded the plan after he was elected.
Mr. Zarb, a Republican, noted wryly that, "taking over anything wasn't exactly a Republican formula."
The new Governor ousted Mr. Kessel as chairman of the Power Authority. Mr. Kessel arrived at the authority one day to find his desk cleaned out and his things piled in a corridor. Mr. Pataki proposed his own formula, to break up Lilco into several pieces and sell them off. After that plan wilted under widespread criticism, he appointed Mr. Zarb as chairman and asked him to find a better answer.
Mr. Zarb and Mr. Kessel, along with administration officials, spent a year negotiating the deal with Lilco that was announced in March. Then Mr. Zarb left the Power Authority to become president of the National Association of Securities Dealers. To replace him as chairman, Mr. Pataki appointed Mr. Kessel, the man the Governor had forced out of that post two years earlier.
"Nothing about this whole history was easy," Mr. Kessel said. "It might have been inevitable, but it was a lot of work."

Private Guards Credited With Decrease in Crime

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 20

 BODY:
A 50 percent drop in crime in Hollywood is being attributed to a business improvement district's hiring of private security guards.
Drug-related activity, trespassing and other nuisance crimes have decreased over the past several months, business owners and the police said on Friday. 
 Aggravated assaults and vehicle break-ins were down two-thirds in the second quarter of 1997 compared with the same period last year, and robberies were down 25 percent, said Valerie Munoz, a crime analyst for the Hollywood division of the Los Angeles Police Department.
The Hollywood Business Improvement District was formed six months ago with a five-year goal of changing the area's seedy image and attracting new retail businesses and restaurants.

HEADLINE: From Rags to Riches: Versace's South Beach;
Designer Left His Stamp On Community

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO 

DATELINE: MIAMI BEACH, July 20

 BODY:
When the fashion designer Gianni Versace announced in the early 1990's his plans to demolish a boarded-up three-story hotel here to make room for his swimming pool, George T. Neary fought him. Mr. Neary, the executive director of the Miami Design Preservation League, said he was more interested in saving a building in the historic Art Deco district than gaining a celebrity for it.
But by the time Mr. Versace, who ultimately got his swimming pool, was gunned down in front of his house on Tuesday, he had won over his former opponents, restoring a former apartment building as a magnificent home that won awards and helping local preservationists successfully lobby for stronger laws to protect other buildings. 
 "We've lost a neighbor," a saddened Mr. Neary said this weekend of the enemy who became an ally.
Mr. Versace's death has brought the familiar international outcry about violence in America to this city's South Beach section, a bustling district of historic architecture, topless beaches and relentless night life that is the jewel of tourist attractions in Miami's metropolitan area.
The vision of preservationists, the growing Hispanic population of South Florida and the arrival of celebrities like Mr. Versace have helped promote the area's stunning transformation in less than two decades from a decaying area to a vibrant one. But South Beach has an aura of danger, thanks to television.
Nancy Liebman, a Miami Beach commissioner and longtime historic preservation advocate, traces South Beach's dramatic rise -- from a crime-ridden enclave best known for its poor retirees, crumbling hotels and refugees from the 1980 Cuban boatlift -- to three milestones.
The first was the inclusion of a one-square-mile district in Miami Beach's southern tip in the National Register of Historic Places in 1979, which saved South Beach's early 20th-century architecture from bulldozers. The second was the worldwide publicity generated by the Bulgarian-born artist Christo, who stayed with his staff in South Beach hotels in 1983 while wrapping a cluster of Biscayne Bay islands in pink fabric in the name of art.
Then, in the mid-1980's, the television show "Miami Vice" brought South Beach to the masses with a violent but stylish portrayal of a Miami area steeped in crime and clad in sockless loafers. The exposure helped draw fashion photographers looking for winter shooting locations to South Beach, as well as developers who restored pastel Art Deco hotels and added sidewalk cafes and television and record companies. It also attracted hordes of tourists, now the economic engine of the area.
"The place became known for the excitement," Ms. Liebman said. But after Mr. Versace, 50, was fatally shot at the gate of his South Beach estate -- the suspect is sought in four slayings elsewhere and remains at large -- the district finds itself in need of damage control.
The American press treated the Versace killing as an act aimed at a particular victim that could have happened anywhere, said Mayco Villafana, a spokesman for the Greater Miami Convention and Visitors Bureau, but the foreign news media related it to tourist killings in the Miami area in 1992 and 1993 that led to a drop in visitors.
The bureau is planning trips for journalists from Italy and other European countries to dispel fears, Mr. Villafana said.
"This was an issue of a man and not a place," Mr. Villafana insisted.
Mr. Versace found relaxation and inspiration in South Beach, his friends and acquaintances said, and he turned up the voltage on its glitter. His catalogs and advertisements featured South Beach backdrops, and he devoted one of his collections to Miami, emblazoning the city's name, 1950's Cadillacs and Art Deco hotels across $1,800 silk shirts and other clothing items that sold worldwide.
"He promoted the city in a way that had never been done," said Glenn Albin, editor in chief of Ocean Drive Magazine, a monthly here. "It was outstanding."
Mr. Versace also stimulated the local market by buying his Ocean Drive residence in 1992 and later opening a store that soon was in the company of other high-end fashion shops. And Mr. Versace impressed the preservation watchdogs in Miami Beach, a city of about 93,000 where voters recently passed a referendum calling for limits on high-rise development, with his elaborate renovation of Casa Casuarina. He bought the 1930 Mediterranean Revival-style structure for $2.9 million, then then invested millions more, building a pool and a garden. Ms. Liebman called it "the most perfect restoration in South Beach, to the last detail."
But Mr. Versace was also attracted to the more hedonistic side of South Beach, a sexy and carefree world of stretch limousines and glamorous models, of bare navels and bulging muscles in bronzed bodies and after-hours clubs. Its large gay population tends to be apolitical and incohesive. It is no coincidence, some say, that many gay men with AIDS have come to South Beach to spend their last years.
"This is a place of escape for people from all walks of life," said Eugene J. Patron, who writes about gay issues for The Miami Herald and serves on the board of the South Beach Business Guild, the gay chamber of commerce, which has 140 members.
When in town, Mr. Versace, who was gay, frequented restaurants, nightclubs and the beach within walking distance of Ocean Drive, a beachfront strip of hotels and restaurants where he owned the only house. In a growing Hispanic area and vacation hot spot for European and South American tourists, he enjoyed the international atmosphere and exhibitionism, translating his impressions into the color and vibrancy of fashion, some who knew him said.
"He saw it as a civilized bazaar," said Israel Sands, a local florist who decorated many of Mr. Versace's parties and dinners and, last week, his casket and the urn with his ashes. "People have a lot of energy and come here to express it. It stimulated him."
But it is also a transient world where someone like Andrew P. Cunanan, the 27-year-old suspected of killing the designer, could easily disappear.
Described as a gay prostitute by law-enforcement authorities, Mr. Cunanan is now believed to have stayed in a Miami Beach hotel for two months before the murder. Hotels workers have said he usually left his hotel room after 10 P.M. and would not come back until morning.
In recent years, some residents of South Beach have complained that the area may be a victim of its own success. They say the overpriced shops, scarce parking and appreciating real estate have robbed South Beach of the bohemian character given by the artists, gays and others who first moved here because of cheap housing.
And while Miami Beach police say robberies are still a worse problem than homicides, Mr. Versace's violent death has robbed many of a sense of innocence.
"You feel this overwhelming sense that the community is so shaken by this that it can't help but taint things," said Bob Guilmartin, vice president of the Florida Hotel Network, a reservations company here.

HEADLINE: America's Vital Interest in the 'New Silk Road'

BYLINE: By James A. Baker 3d; James A. Baker 3d, Secretary of State under President George Bush, is honorary chairman of the James A. Baker 3d Institute for Public Policy at Rice University.

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
On Aug. 2, 1990, when Iraqi troops crossed the border into Kuwait, I happened to be meeting with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in Siberia.
The next day, he and I issued a joint statement condemning Iraq, despite the fact that the document had not been formally cleared with the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Mr. Shevardnadze made the decision on his own because he felt it was simply the right thing to do. "When the two of us meet," he told me, "there must be results." Such personal and political courage exhibited by Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze throughout this period helped write an end to the cold war. 
 Mr. Shevardnadze has been in Washington these last few days in his new role as President of Georgia. He talked to President Clinton, members of the Cabinet and business leaders about opportunities for American companies in Georgia. I hope they will listen sympathetically: Georgia needs American investment, and more important, it is in the strategic interests of the United States to build the strongest possible economic, cultural and political ties to Georgia.
Under Mr. Shevardnadze's leadership, Georgia has emerged as one of the most Western-friendly countries of the former Soviet Union, with a rapidly growing economy. Georgia's importance is its location at the nexus of Europe and Asia, with ports on the Black Sea. The country is poised to be a principal outlet for bringing the oil and gas resources of the Caspian Sea to international markets. Caspian oil may eventually be as important to the industrialized world as Middle East oil is today. Georgia's future security, therefore, is important to America's security.
Georgia sits at the Western end of what is often described as the "new silk road," the revival of historical trade routes linking China and Central Asia with Europe. In addition, Georgia's oil and gas resources will lead to the development of new road, rail and communications links. Development of this Eurasian corridor is receiving priority from a number of international organizations.
These changes have transformed the continent from the north-south character of the former Soviet Union into the east-west orientation of the new independent nations. Enders Wimbush, a leading analyst of the region, has called this change "one of the fundamental political shifts of our time, with important consequences for U.S. strategic interests from Europe to China."
Mr. Shevardnadze sees this transformation more clearly than most. He understands the cultures involved, the historical relationships, the importance of timing. He has carefully nurtured relations with his country's neighbors and actively promoted regional economic cooperation and growth to bring a new stability to the region.
American businessmen in the region speak of his ability to get things done. Some cite the way he re-opened the important rail link between Baku in Azerbaijan and the Georgian port of Batumi that had long since fallen into disuse, but now carries over a million barrels of oil a month from Kazakhstan to the West.
To me, Mr. Shevardnadze has always been more than a politician and diplomat. He has an ability to predict with great accuracy the future flow of world events.
His current visit, the first as President of his country, is important not only to Georgia but also to the United States. We can benefit from listening to this man of experience and understanding.

CORRECTION-DATE: July 26, 1997, Saturday

 An Op-Ed article last Monday by former Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d called for the United States to build strong ties to the country of Georgia partly because of its potential importance as a shipping outlet for oil and gas. Mr. Baker's law firm represents an oil consortium and other companies in the region. The Times should have made those interests known to the reader.

HEADLINE: Dads' Staying Home Won't Erase Black Poverty

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I was disturbed by "A Pitiful Giant," Bob Herbert's July 18 column lambasting the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People for not making black children's "abandonment by their own fathers" the first priority at its annual convention. 
 Mr. Herbert's assertion that children who grow up in fatherless homes are more likely to be in poverty may well be true, but is the lack of fathers a cause or effect of poverty? Just having fathers live with their children will not resolve the severe problems confronting many blacks in the inner city: underfinanced, poorly managed schools and a lack of decent-paying jobs.
Will a poorly educated father unable to find a job be able to save his child from poverty, crime and unemployment just because he resides in the same home? I doubt it.
Who cares if Kweisi Mfume, the N.A.A.C.P.'s president, fathered illegitimate children in the past? At least he regrets his past and has made an effort to be a good father.
Yes, as Mr. Herbert implies, the black community -- like all communities -- needs to do some soul searching. Yes, Mr. Mfume and the association's chairwoman, Myrlie Evers-Williams, may be too quick to use vague, paranoid rhetoric. However, in a country where racism still abounds and equal opportunity is little more than an oxymoron, I hardly think flawed leadership and absentee fathers are the slavery of the late 20th century.

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
A 'Shrew' As Good As Gold

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY 

DATELINE: STRATFORD, Ontario, July 18

 BODY:
And you thought it was a boy beats girl story. It's money -- not love, not the clashing of the sexes -- that makes the world go round in the Stratford Festival production of "The Taming of the Shrew." This is the not entirely unwarranted view set forth by the young director Richard Rose in his lively if overburdened interpretation of the comedy.
Reset in Little Italy in Manhattan, with a Petruchio who says (sorry Shakespeare, sorry Cole Porter) he comes "to wive it wealthily in America," the production is awash with images of people flashing bankrolls and symbols of conspicuous consumption. The show ends with a shower of what look like greenbacks falling over the newly renovated Festival Theater. And Mr. Rose has been quoted as saying that the play's title character is "a shrew because she is being treated as an economic product." 
 Actually, a preoccupation with things fiscal is understandable in anyone associated with this ever-worthy 44-year-old repertory company, which remains unmatched in North America in its ability to bring large audiences (now more than half a million people, 35 percent of them Americans) to see a Shakespeare-oriented roster of classic theater every summer. Artistic ambition may remain a cornerstone. But there is also a pervasive, slightly weary sense that what is put on the stages here must indeed be viable economic products.
Under Richard Monette, the artistic director since 1995, the festival would seem to be in the pink of health. Forty years after it replaced the giant tent under which the legendary showman Tyrone Guthrie staged the company's first productions in 1953, the Festival Theater has undergone a $10.5 million renovation (all figures in American dollars), which has been celebrated this season with events that included a visit from Queen Elizabeth II.
Its acclaimed 1995 production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" has been turned into an equally acclaimed film. Its mounting of Christopher Plummer's one-man show "Barrymore" was transferred to an award-reaping Broadway run. And plans are being made to take two Festival Theater productions to City Center in New York annually, beginning at the end of 1998. But as in the United States, government subsidies for the arts are shrinking like cotton clothes in an overheated dryer. In the last three years, about 35 percent of the money from the Ontario Arts Council has disappeared, and overall government support is now just over 6 percent of the festival's $20 million budget. No one's making a secret of the way this necessarily shapes the company's artistic policy.
In a special festival edition of The Beacon Herald, Mr. Monette, whose tenure has been extended through 2000, comments: "These theaters were not designed to work without subsidy. Because what will happen is we will become more and more reliant on box office successes. It's already a difficult balancing act."
Accordingly, there is always at least one big, familiar musical on the schedule. (This year's is "Camelot," in a sumptuous production designed expressly by the company veteran Desmond Heeley to match the glamorously refurbished interior of the Festival Theater.) And the standing repertory of actors is flecked with stars from Canadian television, including Al Waxman, who does a creditable Willy Loman in Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman."
Even within productions of classics, however, the feeling of Mr. Monette's balancing act is clearly in evidence. The festival's most intriguing offerings -- a revival of Peter Shaffer's "Equus," directed by and starring Brian Bedford, and a re-creation of the company's famed 1955 production of "Oedipus Rex," modeled after Tanya Moiseiwitch's original designs and masks -- have yet to open. But four current productions ("Shrew," "Camelot," "Coriolanus" and "Salesman") offer an index of the festival's strengths and weaknesses.
All are handsomely staged, often creating a sense of lavishness from minimal means. And the general standard of acting, particularly in terms of ease with Shakespearean language, is higher than that generally found in American productions, including those of the New York Shakespeare Festival.
Yet each production gives off an aggressive air of overeagerness that sacrifices nuance for attention-getting broad strokes. The whimsy quotient of "Camelot," directed by Mr. Monette, is raised to an almost assaultive level, with the result that nearly every musical number seemed to end with the unspoken question, "Are we having fun yet?"
The domestic squabbles of "Salesman," as staged by Diana Leblanc (the director of the festival's production of "Long Day's Journey") take on an operatic intensity that nearly eclipses Mr. Waxman's touchingly straightforward portrait of a loser. And the martial sturm und drang of "Coriolanus," directed by Mr. Rose, registers as a noisy pageant of 20th-century war-is-hell images that doesn't reckon with the psychological pathology of its central characters.
Mr. Rose's "Shrew" also suffers from a surfeit of flash, but it does occasionally open a window onto new perspectives on the comedy. Petruchio (Peter Donaldson) is portrayed here as a down-at-heel Italian immigrant in the New York of the 1960's. The production's Little Italy (or Nuova Padua, as the characters, who speak Elizabethan English with thick Italian accents, call it) is a world of mercenary padrones, garishly decorative women and small-time hustlers. (When a character says, "There are good fellows in the world," it has special significance.)
The director fills the stage with a San Gennaro-like festival of tipsy ecclesiastics and musicians, actors dressed up as Manhattan tourist attractions like the Chrysler building, a creepy castleful of cartoonish Gothic servants at Petruchio's moldy estate in Italy and cardboard yellow taxis in traffic jams. It all gets out of hand finally. (The newly married Petruchio and Kate, played by Lucy Peacock, take Alitalia flights to and from Italy.) And there's the sense that the production is often running on a track that parallels rather than intersects with Shakespeare's text.
But the show convincingly illuminates the work's emphasis on materialism. And Ms. Peacock and especially Mr. Donaldson, who finds a wry, reflective strain of self-awareness in his volatile Petruchio, make an attractive case for the characters' relationship as a process of mutual education. Mr. Rose's ingenious justification of Kate's final, submissive speech should pacify even militant feminists.
It's harder to believe in the romantic triangle in "Camelot," in which King Arthur (Tom McCamus), Guenevere (Cynthia Dale) and Lancelot (Dan R. Chameroy) all register as giddy adolescents playing medieval dress-up, with an unfortunate tendency to annotate the songs' lyrics with literal-minded gestures.
In "Shrew," however, Ms. Dale does a witty take on Bianca as a spoiled Italian-American princess. The sprightly, slight-bodied Mr. McCamus, while a winning performer, is miscast both as Arthur and Coriolanus, though he does manage to hold the center of the stage with an inflexible sneer as Coriolanus. And Martha Henry, a longtime Festival Theater favorite, is truly dominating, even terrifying, as Volumnia, Coriolanus's autocratic mother.
In a testament to the opportunities for actorly stretching afforded by repertory companies, Ms. Henry also shows up as Willy Loman's drab, faithful wife, Linda, in "Salesman," although costumes aside, there's little drabness in the character here. In fact, with her deep, resonant voice and high-wattage presence, the actress brings a residual touch of Volumnia to Linda, which gives a whole new, unsettling flavor to the Loman sons' relationship with their mother.
When this Linda says, "Attention must be paid," it's a stern, booming command that you don't dare ignore. Getting people to pay attention, after all, is what Stratford specializes in.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
The Connecting Line

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL 

 BODY:
In just one day last week three stories were reported that told of the stunning successes the Chinese Politburo has achieved in manipulating America and diminishing it as a credible political player in the Far East.
Americans can find similar stories almost every day in their press. But American journalism, like American diplomacy and politics, has failed to show the clear line that connects the stories. And historically -- meaning from tomorrow deep into the next century -- that failure can be the Politburo's biggest triumph of all. 
 One story dealt with China's plan to influence the American Presidential race and how President Clinton insisted that the agent of Beijing's chief overseas economic commercial partner be given a role in the campaign.
This agent, John Huang, received regular C.I.A. briefings. If the White House does not understand that anything interesting the C.I.A. told him found its way through his Indonesian masters to their Beijing partners, it would be obscene self-delusion amounting to dereliction of duty.
Another story was about the growing worry in Congress that U.S. intelligence has not kept track of how China's increasing military and political power affect America. The House has called for a report within a year. It appropriated $5 million to hire academics to help our multibillion-dollar intelligence machinery.
The third story told of how the dissident movement has been crushed in China. The Communists got a free hand when the Clinton Administration dropped human rights as a goal of its foreign policy. The Communists then had no worry about economic penalty for the torture and murder of Chinese guilty of trying to express themselves. So they set to work.
Just another human rights story. But the connecting line among all the successes of China is human rights. The line begins with President Clinton's decision in 1994 to renege on promises he had made to use economic pressure to help imprisoned Chinese and Tibetan dissidents.
Human rights for Chinese -- the right to speak, write and worship as they choose -- should be important in themselves to Americans. They should make us cherish and protect our own, inspire us to give a hand to those who have none.
The apologists for China sneer at all that. What are we, missionaries? They say Americans supporting human rights thirst for enemies after the Soviet breakup and select China for the role.
This is a knowing falsehood. The opposite is true. Like other police-state rulers, Chinese Communists live in fear of their people's desire for liberties. They see American democracy as the danger to the Communist Party, the inevitable enemy. They search out other dictatorships for help in damaging America.
That is why China sells nuclear technology to the likes of Iran. To weaken America -- that is the connecting line in Politburo policy.
For Mr. Clinton, the decision to betray Chinese human rights was the beginning of the line to the other accommodations and appeasements that flowed from it. Could he have brought into his campaign a man useful only because of his links with China, direct or indirect, if he were still standing up to what the Communists were doing to dissidents?
The President's men, and women, walk the line with him. For career reasons, they pretended to believe his cynical fantasy that deserting human rights would somehow make the Communists improve human rights. They said straight-faced that it would also persuade the Politburo to safeguard America's security interests -- no more sales of cruise missiles and nuclear technology to the Irans of the world.
So when American intelligence did report those sales, the Administration whined a bit but accepted Beijing's insulting answer that it knew nothing about the sales. They expected Americans to believe even pistols could be exported from China without Beijing's approval.
Only one thing prevents Beijing from fully relishing its double victory over Chinese human rights and America's claims to international moral leadership.
Beijing has not yet stamped out one human rights struggle -- the passion for freedom of worship. Yesterday the U.S. again acknowledged the persecution of Christians in China. America's Government will try to remain detached. America's people may not.

HEADLINE: France Raises Business Taxes, and Anxiety Over Euro

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: PARIS, July 21

 BODY:
France's Government raised taxes sharply for big business today after an audit showed that this year's budget deficit is running well above the target set to qualify for the European Union's planned single currency.
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the Finance Minister, announced a 15 percent increase in taxes on large corporations and vowed that France would qualify for the euro, the common currency, "in the same conditions as our partners." 
 But with less than 18 months to go before the planned introduction of the euro, the French budget difficulties seemed certain to accentuate German anxieties. Germany is already deeply nervous about the imminent abandonment of its mark, the symbol of its postwar economic strength and stability.
The German Finance Minister, Theo Waigel, put a brave face on the French problems, declaring that Mr. Strauss-Kahn had assured him by telephone of his commitment to meeting the budget targets set for the euro. But it seemed clear from today's announcements that France's notoriously swollen public employment rolls are still far from being brought under lasting control.
The euro is much more than a financial project, in the absence of any momentum toward political union in Europe. It amounts to the cornerstone of efforts to revive European integration and so eventually to form a credible counterweight to the United States.
The French and German political investment in the plan is enormous, and their joint commitment to overcoming any last-minute hitches is considerable. But tension is mounting as the German Bundesbank, the rock on which the mark's strength has been based, grows increasingly concerned that attempts will be made to fudge economic criteria in the name of political imperatives.
Two independent auditors appointed last month by the new Socialist Prime Minister, Lionel Jospin, reported today that the French deficit for 1997 would, without corrective measures, amount to between 3.5 and 3.7 percent of gross domestic product, or total national output.
This would be well in excess of the 3 percent deficit set as a target by the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, which laid out a road map to a single European currency. These steps were supposed to insure that the euro would be backed with the same economic rigor that sustained the German mark for decades and made it the world's second-largest reserve currency, behind the dollar.
The members' 1997 deficit figures and compliance with other targets concerning inflation and the national debt are to be used by European leaders next May in choosing which countries qualify for the scheduled introduction of the euro on Jan. 1, 1999. Thus the French deficit figure for this year is critical, as a euro without its central promoters, France and Germany, is widely viewed as untenable.
Announcing measures today that he said would lower the projected 1997 deficit by $5.3 billion, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said that the corporate tax rate would be raised to 41.6 percent from 36.6 percent for companies with annual sales of over $8.3 million. The increase will apply to this year and 1998; after that, the tax will gradually be lowered again.
In addition, corporate capital gains, previously taxed at 19 percent, will be permanently taxed at the same rate as profits. Over all, these tax increases -- called the "euro surcharge" by commentators -- will bring in about two-thirds of the $5.3 billion, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said.
The remainder of the money, he said, is to be found through spending cuts, particularly in the military budget, and through a special contribution from the profitable state-owned electric utility.
The Finance Minister declined to set a specific target for the 1997 budget deficit, but he said the measures "concern 0.4 percent of gross domestic product." Thus, in the absence of further taxes or spending cuts, the French 1997 deficit seems set to total between 3.1 and 3.3 percent of total output, still above the Maastricht target.
But if some flexibility is shown to France over the criteria for qualification, it will be very difficult to deny the same treatment to Italy, Spain and Portugal, which also seem likely to come just above the 3 percent target. The inclusion of these countries, especially Italy, would deepen fears in Germany that the euro would lack credibility and so resemble the lira more than the mark. Already about two-thirds of Germans express deep doubts about the euro.
Since last August, the mark has dropped about 18 percent against the dollar, and concern has grown about what kind of currency the euro will be. It has also dropped 32 percent against sterling, which is being viewed as a haven from euro-related turbulence because Britain has indicated it will not join the euro in 1999. Recent comments from Hans Tietmeyer, the president of the Bundesbank, suggesting that the mark's fall has gone far enough have done little to stabilize it.
French businessmen reacted angrily to the tax increases, saying they were precisely what France does not need. "Raising taxes will slow growth," said Georges Jolles, the vice president of the employers' federation. "France already taxes too much, and the state spends too much."
The new 41.6 percent tax rate compares with a rate of between 25 percent and 33 percent in Britain and is also well above the American corporate tax rate. The taxes help finance France's public spending, which amounts to about 55 percent of total national output, compared with an average of 40 percent in other major industrialized countries.
Mr. Jospin, who was elected last month in a surprise Socialist victory, made clear commitments during the election campaign to maintain the size of the public sector. He criticized privatization and suggested he would create 350,000 new state jobs.
Since then, under severe budget pressure, he has retreated somewhat, but his maneuvering room in raising money needed to meet the Maastricht targets is very limited.
In this context, he opted for new corporate taxes rather than for other measures. Nevertheless, his Communist coalition partners and some Socialists are already criticizing him for making the euro a higher priority than tackling an unemployment rate of close to 13 percent.
The choice of new taxes rather than lasting cuts in public spending will only increase the Bundesbank's anxiety. In that the measures announced today are more onetime measures than real structural changes that would balance France's budget in the long term, they are unlikely to satisfy the German bankers or to ease growing concerns that the euro is destined to be weak.

HEADLINE: A Budget Deal Not Worth Saving

 BODY:
The current budget negotiations between the President and Congress are often portrayed as an epic struggle over how to cut taxes, trim spending, invest in education and balance the budget for the first time in a quarter-century. But a less flattering version would note that the roaring economy is already driving the deficit close to zero, making a final deal superfluous if not harmful. Indeed, the deficit could be eliminated quicker if the budget deal collapsed.
Some of the budget deal's potential provisions smell rancid. An unfair allocation of very steep Medicare cuts could damage urban hospitals that train doctors and care for the poor. Various proposals would create tax dodges for wealthy investors, eviscerate tax collections a decade from now, encourage colleges to raise tuition and starve nearly every discretionary spending program. No one need mourn if the members of Congress who harbor misgivings, from Senator Phil Gramm of Texas on the right to Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota on the left or a President pushed to his limit by excessive tax cutting for wealthy families, decide to scuttle the deal. 
 With tax revenue soaring, this year's deficit may fall below $45 billion, a pittance in a $7 trillion economy. Though the budget deal would eventually trim the deficit, it would actually slow deficit reduction next year because its tax cuts and spending hikes kick in immediately, while spending cuts are postponed. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a corporate-financed nonpartisan group, the budget would be balanced by 2001 if Congress merely locked current policies in place. Under the budget deal it would take one year more to achieve balance. Either way, the deficit will eventually rise again, to large numbers, early next century.
It may be asking too much for Congress, or the President, to admit publicly that the budget plan has gone off track. But the booming economy ought to change the dynamics of the negotiations, by making a final deal less important. Fratricide among Republicans after the failed coup against House Speaker Newt Gingrich could further alter the dynamics. President Clinton negotiates with a weaker Speaker, but one who can no longer afford to jeopardize his tenuous hold on conservative allies.
Mr. Clinton has vowed to reject many of the G.O.P.'s tax proposals that either open huge holes in the budget or favor the nation's wealthiest families. If he recognizes that the budget deal is at best of marginal value, he might stiffen his resolve to beat back the worst excesses of the Republican plans. If the Republicans then threaten to back out of the budget deal, so much the better.

HEADLINE: COMPANY REPORTS;
Boeing Has Its Feet on the Ground

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
In the aerospace business, Boeing seems invincible. By placing big bets on new aircraft and paying close attention to research and engineering, it has grown to dominate its industry by a wide margin. When it has tried to diversify outside the notoriously volatile aircraft industry, though, it has a remarkable history of missing the mark.
Through the years, the Boeing Company has made everything from windmills and hydrofoils to rail cars and computer-controlled buses. In its early days, it even tried making furniture. And while most of these ventures were considered technical successes, they all drained cash until the company shut them down. 
 Now, undeterred, Boeing is breaking out into new areas again. But there is a difference this time: The company finally appears to have learned from its mistakes. In recent months, the Seattle-based Boeing has announced a number of new ventures -- such as selling corporate jets and training pilots -- that suggest that it has decided to stay close to its aerospace roots.
"Boeing has learned that if it reaches too far afield, it gets burned," said Wolfgang H. Demisch, an aerospace analyst at BT Securities. "So it is trying to somehow extend its presence by building on its existing franchises."
More is at stake than simply erasing Boeing's dubious record in sideline businesses. For one, the new ventures, if successful, can help smooth out the cyclical swings that have long buffeted Boeing's stock price and the size of its work force.
That search for balance was a big reason Boeing announced last December its intention to acquire the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, whose strength in military contracting should complement Boeing's commercial aircraft business. But that deal, scheduled to be completed early next month, has encountered sharp criticism from the European Union, which has threatened to oppose the merger tomorrow in its final ruling unless Boeing accepts severe restrictions on its operations. The Clinton Administration has signaled that it may retaliate if the European Union decides to impose stiff fines on Boeing.
For all its problems with European regulators, Boeing has another kind of problem -- the kind any company would love to have. It expects to generate such hefty profits in coming years that it will be forced to find new uses for all the cash. Yesterday, it reported second-quarter net income of $334 million on revenues of $9.29 billion. The results were short of analysts' expectations, and the stock fell $1.6875, closing at $54.375. But that is probably just a blip on the radar. And this time, Boeing is not waiting to start searching for new businesses only after aircraft orders have slumped and it is struggling to keep its workers busy.
"That is a significant difference between the past and where we are today," said Lawrence W. Clarkson, president of Boeing Enterprises, a division created in January to seek out and manage new ventures.
Boeing, for example, is now in the corporate jet business. The idea grew out of conversations between Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chairman, and John F. Welch, chairman of the General Electric Company, a big supplier of engines to Boeing as well as a big buyer of jets for its aircraft leasing division.
According to Boeing executives, Mr. Welch had already committed to buying two 737's for corporate use, but mentioned to Mr. Condit that they still lacked the range of traditional, smaller corporate jets.
Boeing then set 100 engineers to work designing a 737 with the most modern wings and bigger fuel tanks to get its range above 6,000 miles. Offered this new capability, Mr. Welch immediately switched his order to the new version and, convinced such a plane would appeal to other executives, joined Boeing as a partner to start Boeing Business Jets. The planes, at about $38 million to $40 million each, are approximately the same price as the smaller, top-of-the-line corporate jets made by Gulfstream and Bombardier.
At a news conference last year to announce the venture, Boeing officials had planned to say they expected to sell six to eight business jets a year, but Mr. Welch persuaded them to push the estimate to 10 a year. None of them were right. In the first year, Boeing has taken orders for 20 corporate jets, including one from the golfer Greg Norman, whom Boeing has signed up as a pitchman to help sell the planes.
Perhaps the strongest validation of the new market for large corporate jets came from Boeing's biggest rival, Airbus Industrie, which announced last month that it, too, would start selling a modified version of its A319 as a corporate jet.
In January, Boeing Business Jets was folded into the new Boeing Enterprises division, which has moved quickly into other ventures. In March, it joined forces with Flightsafety International, a company acquired last year by the investor Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., to train commercial-jet pilots. And in May, Boeing Enterprises agreed to a joint venture with Aero Vodochody, a Czech manufacturer of military jet fighters.
Mr. Clarkson said Boeing Enterprises was considering a number of other businesses. One is heavy maintenance of aircraft, work that many airlines prefer to farm out to subcontractors. If it proceeds with that idea, Boeing may find itself competing against some of its airline customers. Lufthansa, for example, handles heavy maintenance for more than 100 airlines. Lufthansa said it did not see Boeing conflicting with its interests unless Boeing went after some of its maintenance clients.
Other possibilities, Boeing Enterprises executives say, include managing the installation of aircraft interiors, an increasingly complex task because of the growing sophistication of in-flight video and audio systems.
Boeing officials declined to predict how much revenue Boeing Enterprises may generate in coming years. But Nicholas Heymann, an aerospace analyst at Prudential Securities, has estimated that Boeing Enterprises could take in $5 billion by 2000, with operating profit margins of about 20 to 25 percent. He also predicted that the division would grow 8 to 10 percent a year.
Boeing officials said two overarching criteria would guide Boeing Enterprises' expansion into new areas: It must know at least something about the products and their customers.
As sensible as that strategy sounds, Boeing is nevertheless adding to the challenges it faces in coming years, particularly in trying to absorb McDonnell Douglas into its corporate culture.
"The jury is still out on whether they are overreaching themselves in other business," Mr. Demisch said. "What they are attempting is pretty ambitious."
For all the challenges of the corporate strategy, though, one thing is clear: Boeing will leave behind fewer curiosities for historians. When the aircraft industry slumped in 1918 after the end of World War I, for example, Boeing tried to augment its modest plane-building business by making flat-bottomed boats called sea sleds and furniture like dressers and phonograph cases.
Boeing had hoped to sell the boats to the Navy, but they eventually wound up in the hands of private owners who bought them at a discount. And Boeing's own employees bought much of the furniture at clearance prices. According to "Legend and Legacy," a history of Boeing by Robert J. Serling, the company sent out a notice to employees that included this sales pitch: "P.S. If you have delayed getting married on account of the high price of furniture, now is the time to get a good start."
The next big push to diversify came after World War II, when Boeing's production lines for bombers were almost shut down. It considered getting into the car and household appliance businesses, but Boeing executives determined that that would be too much of a stretch even for them. The company tried the turbine engine business instead.
In the late 1960's, when business was so slow that Boeing at one point went 18 months without getting a single aircraft order, the company branched into a wide variety of businesses. It built passenger and military hydrofoils, wind-powered turbines, public transit equipment, even police radio scramblers. At one point, Boeing was planting and selling potatoes as part of an irrigation experiment.
Boeing officials said at the time that their goal was to have a third of the company's revenue coming from nontraditional areas by 1980. "We are going to respond to social needs," a Boeing official told Time magazine in 1971. "If we do not, we will be a limited company."
But as demand picked up for planes, particularly with airline deregulation in 1978, Boeing eventually left all these businesses to focus on the products and customers it knew best. In the process, it became a far narrower company, although a far more prosperous one than if it had continued pouring money into extraneous ventures.
Since then, Boeing has gone through a fundamental change, and has come to see itself as an aerospace company, rather than a company with engineering prowess that can be applied to just about anything.
One former Boeing executive who was involved in many past diversification efforts, John H. Goldie, summed up Boeing's mistakes in "Legend and Legacy," although his words serve as a warning to all companies:
"Boeing never had a strategy to diversify in any intelligent way," Mr. Goldie said. "It gets into these things on an ad hoc basis. Somebody promotes an idea and if he's reasonably capable, it'll work. But if the guy's an idiot and doesn't do any market research, it'll be a disaster."

Over the years, Boeing has diversified to try to protect itself against downturns in the aircraft industry. But these attempts have not been commercially successful. Now it is embarking on new ventures. This time, though, Boeing's plans, such as custom fitting 737's as corporate jets, are within its area of expertise.

Bonds Quiet As Greenspan Is Awaited

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices were little changed yesterday as investors braced for Congressional testimony from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, as well as for the Treasury's sale of $27 billion in new debt this week.
"Greenspan is a bit of a wild card tomorrow" for the bond market, said Bill Girard, who helps manage $3 billion in fixed-income assets at Scotia Capital Markets in Toronto. 
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 4/32, to 101 5/32. The bond's yield, which moves the opposite direction from its price, rose to 6.54 percent, from 6.52 percent on Friday.
The Fed chairman delivers his semiannual testimony on the state of the economy to the House Banking Committee today and its Senate counterpart tomorrow. His comments often set the tone for bond trading because investors look for clues to how the Fed has read the latest economic reports.
Mr. Greenspan's comments today come just an hour after the bidding deadline for the Government's sale of $15.5 billion of two-year notes. That may prompt investors to demand higher yields on the securities, in case the central bank chief says something that roils the market.
The Government will also auction $11.5 billion in five-year notes tomorrow. Wall Street firms required to bid at Treasury debt sales often drive yields higher beforehand to stir demand from investors.
"We've got to get through Greenspan's testimony" before investors grow more bullish on bonds again, said Bill Edwards, a trader at Nikko Securities Company International. "There is going to be some anxiety until then."
Many traders expect the Treasury rally, which pushed the yield on the 30-year bond down about 60 basis points since late April, to resume after the Fed chairman completes his testimony. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Still, traders also expect Mr. Greenspan to be circumspect in his assessment of the economy so as not to fuel optimism among investors.
"The environment he would create would stimulate the economy and that could be negative in the long run," said Tony Crescenzi, head trader at Miller Tabak Hirsch & Company. "He has to sound a little bit hawkish."
In the corporate bond market, Stater Brothers Holdings Inc., the Autotote Corporation and Safety Components International -- all rated below investment grade -- raised $200 million, taking advantage of the low borrowing rates.
The Riverwood International Corporation and several other companies are expected to sell about $3 billion of debt this week.
In the municipal market, New York City plans to sell $445 million in general obligation bonds today.
In connection with its tax-exempt issue, New York City sold $75 million in taxable floating-rate notes yesterday to European investors. The securities pay interest at a rate equal to the three-month London interbank offered rate plus 25 basis points.
The Treasury sold $23.4 billion in three-month and six-month bills at its regular weekly auction. The three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 5.11 percent, up from 5.05 percent last week, and the six-month bills at an average rate of 5.17 percent, up from 5.09 percent. In when-issued trading yesterday, the new two-year notes were being offered at a price to yield 6.17 percent.
Following are the results of the auction of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: A Pulse That Lingers

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL 

 BODY:
Inflation is dead, right? After all, despite more than six years of uninterrupted economic growth and with unemployment now near the levels last enjoyed in the 1960's and early 1970's, consumer prices have risen at a mere 1.4 percent rate so far this year. And the cost of manufactured goods is actually falling.
But don't count out the old nemesis just yet. While hardly anybody is predicting apocalypse soon, there is reason to believe that unemployment is already below the rate consistent with price stability. 
 Indeed, for all the widespread economic optimism that has helped power both the stock market and President Clinton's popularity to new highs, inflation may already be creeping through the economy on little cat's feet.
Robert Gordon, a specialist on inflation at Northwestern University, warned, for example, that wage increases are being disguised as promotions. "It will take at least a year to see it happening," he said.
Inflation's prospects are also being bolstered by the likely end to the set of conditions that have helped hold it in check, such as the low price of oil and the strong dollar, which has kept imports inexpensive.
So far, the news on the inflation front has been so good that the Federal Reserve has barely nudged short-term interest rates higher this year. Indeed, despite his reputation as a inflexible inflation fighter, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has been willing to hold off against considerable pressure from colleagues within the Federal Reserve to raise rates much more sharply.
But when he testifies to Congress today about the outlook for the economy and monetary policy, Mr. Greenspan may give some hints about whether he thinks this rare combination of shrinking unemployment and lower inflation can continue for much longer.
To be sure, the expansion of the 1990's is nearly as old as the 1980's boom without any of the kick-up in prices that brought the last business cycle to an end. Jobs are going begging, but wages have risen only slightly; all the statistics suggest that inflation is locked tightly in its box.
Certainly some things are different and economists have revised their estimates of how low unemployment can go without setting off a new cycle of higher wages and prices. In the early 1990's, Mr. Gordon pegged this figure at slightly more than 6 percent. Now his computer model says the so-called non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment is around 5.3 percent -- three-tenths of 1 percent above the current rate.
Good news has many fathers. Dale Jorgenson, an economist at Harvard, noted that the average worker is older and more experienced than in the late 1980's and thus easier to integrate into a new workplace without a decline in productivity. Then, too, there are more workers "at the margin" -- everyone from retirees to welfare mothers to immigrants (legal and illegal) -- who can be coaxed into the labor market without sharply raising wages.
Rudi Dornbusch, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, emphasizes the diminished role of unions. "There isn't anyone around to organize the pressure for wage increases that has been traditional this late in the business cycle," he said.
All in all, William Dudley, the chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs & Company, concluded, "We've been very lucky."
But there is a dark lining in this silver cloud. The new American jobs machine, suggested Paul Krugman, an economist at M.I.T., is built on a foundation of fear. "The success of what could be called 'the intimidation economy' depends on workers worrying more about security than wages," he argued. "Being nice to the rich hasn't made much difference to the American economy, but being beastly to the poor does seem to increase efficiency."
Other factors -- some of which may be about to run their course -- have also played a role in suppressing inflation. The prices of oil, metals and other commodities have been depressed because there is considerable slack in economic activity outside the United States. And consumers have reaped the benefits of the strong dollar, which has made imports cheaper and kept import-competing manufacturers -- notably auto makers -- from raising prices.
Add, too, the sense that business is finally reaping the productivity rewards from heavy investments in computers.
But the most frequently cited factor explaining the persistence of wage and price stability has been the insecurity of workers. While the actual impact of downsizing on job tenure is debatable, the perception of increased risk is clear.
According to the Pew Research Center in Washington, just 18 percent of workers were "very concerned" they would lose their jobs in May 1988. But in October 1995 -- deep into the current economic boom -- the comparable figure was 34 percent. And it rose yet again, to 47 percent, in March 1996. "The fear lasted, even though the economy kept getting better," explained Larry Hugick, an analyst at Princeton Survey Research, which did the polling for Pew.
All this has contributed to a giddy optimism in which the old assumptions about the lack of free lunches are being challenged. Factors ranging from globalization to outsourcing to computerized inventory control have changed the fundamentals, economists say. "Competitive processes have so intensified," argued Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, "that we're looking at a world in which deflation -- not inflation -- may be the norm."
But many other economists insist that what has dubbed "the new paradigm" is little more than sound financial management by the Federal Reserve and some good luck. The rest, they argue, is wishful thinking.
Mr. Dudley, the Goldman, Sachs economist, distinguishes between changes that have fundamentally improved the trade-off between employment and price stability, and those providing only a temporary breather. Much of the recent restraint on inflation -- the strong dollar, weak commodity prices, lower costs for health insurance -- falls in the latter category.
Why, then, hasn't the pressure shown up in the wage or inflation data? Perhaps only because the pressure builds very slowly, Mr. Gordon said. Based on the experience of the last two decades, his computer model suggests that unemployment at a full percentage point less than the sustainable rate translates into an increase in inflation each year of just four-tenths of a percentage point. So if the sustainable rate is, say, 5.5 percent -- only a half-percent above the current rate -- the impact to date could easily be lost in the numbers.
Besides, Mr. Gordon added, a hard look does offer hints of inflation ahead. While the employment cost index, the Government's most comprehensive measure of wage pressure, has not budged, other measures are beginning to rise. One reason higher wages may not yet be visible in the cost index, Mr. Gordon said, is that employers are using promotions and other rewards to satisfy key workers. "A valued secretary may become an 'executive assistant' at higher pay," he said.
Of course, the only way to know for certain whether unemployment could be driven down further without igniting prices is to try. But economists are leery. "At this point," said Barry Bosworth of the Brookings Institution, "the risks are mostly on the downside."

HEADLINE: German Merger Would Create Europe's No. 2 Bank in Assets

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 21

 BODY:
Two big German banks announced plans today for a $10 billion merger that would create one of the biggest banks in Europe and an institution with more assets than any bank in the United States.
The merger involves the two biggest banks in Bavaria, Bayerische Vereinsbank A.G. and Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank, and is the most dramatic move so far by European banks to shore up their strength to compete in an increasingly borderless economy. 
 Bankers and analysts have been bracing for a big wave of bank mergers in Germany for at least a year. Like several other European countries, Germany has far more banks and bank branches than it needs, analysts say. That has made it progressively harder for banks to earn respectable profits and to brace against new rivals as the drive toward European unity accelerates with the planned adoption of a single currency, starting in 1999.
Though Germany's hometown banks were once able to manage with mediocre profits or growth, they now face the prospect of growing rivalry from neighboring countries and a need for more investment capital in order to serve a broader European clientele.
The new bank would have assets of $472.4 billion, second in Europe only to Deutsche Bank A.G. in Frankfurt and considerably more than the $340 billion in assets of the Chase Manhattan Corporation, the biggest American bank. The combined company will almost certainly have significantly fewer employees, as it shuts down unneeded bank branches and reduces services within others.
Executives at Bayerische Vereinsbank said the deal had been conceived in part to emulate the success of American "supra regional" banks like Nationsbank of Charlotte, N.C., and Banc One of Columbus, Ohio, which have become powerhouses by acquiring scores of smaller institutions over the last decade and shutting down overlapping branches. The two German companies, both based in Munich, predicted that within five years the merger would save them about $600 million a year, largely by cutting back on bank branches and reducing services within branches.
"We have watched very closely what is going on in the world," said Martin Hufner, chief economist at Bayerische Vereinsbank. "It is the banks like Banc One and Nationsbank that have been the fastest growing and most profitable."
In another sign of the growing influence and emulation of American financial services here, both banks were advised by the same American investment bank, J. P. Morgan, which mapped out a complex, two-step merger. Representing both sides in a merger is illegal in the United States, but not in Germany.
The deal would have a major effect on European finance by creating a major new player virtually overnight. It could also prompt more mergers and acquisitions, particularly among smaller banks.
"Europe is overbanked, and the industry is under increasing competitive pressure," said Matthew Czepliewicz, a banking analyst at Salomon Brothers in London. "This is a sign that the banks are recognizing that and are willing to act in fairly radical ways."
The competitive pressure on banks has been particularly fierce in Germany, where there are nearly twice as many bank branches per capita as in either the United States or Britain. Germany has one bank branch for every 1,500 people, compared with one for every 2,723 in the United States and one for every 2,931 in Britain.
The weight of all that infrastructure is apparent in the profitability of the two Bavarian merger partners. Both have a return on equity of about 8 percent, in contrast to a return of 20 percent or more that has been typical of American banks, according to Piers Brown, a banking analyst at UBS Securities.
"The problem that these banks all have is that they have been consuming capital at a rate far faster than they can generate it internally, so they have had to keep going back to the markets" to raise more money, Mr. Brown said.
Indeed, even today, Bayerische Vereinsbank announced that as part of the merger it would try to raise a significant amount of money -- probably more than $1 billion -- to replenish its capital after buying 45 percent of the stock of Hypobank, as its merger partner is known.
Under the proposed merger, Bayerische Vereinsbank will first buy that 45 percent stake, valued at about $4.6 billion, in exchange for shares that it owns of the German insurance company Allianz A.G.
Bayerische Vereinsbank then plans to go back to the market and raise money to shore up its financial position. Next spring, the two banks would then merge into a single entity with new stock.
The deal values Hypobank's shares at 70.8 marks each, or $39.42, based on Allianz's closing stock price today. The value of Hypobank's shares would be above the closing price of 67 marks in Frankfurt, up 8.45 marks, and the total value of the company would be 18.2 billion marks, or $10.13 billion.
Executives at Bayerische Vereinsbank said the virtue of the complicated structure was that it would protect shareholders from seeing their shares diluted. Under this plan, they said, the fully merged company would have 20 percent fewer shares than if it had executed a more conventional merger.
The question on many minds today, however, was whether more big mergers were on the horizon. Mr. Czepliewicz of Salomon Brothers said the deal would probably not set off a frenzy of deals, though it could lead to several combinations of second-tier banks in Germany or mergers by some of the country's big state-owned banks, known as Landesbanks.
Analysts also said that Germany's two biggest banks -- Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank -- were strong enough to proceed on their own and were probably more interested now in foreign acquisitions.
But the announcement today did prompt speculation about Germany's fourth-largest bank, Commerzbank A.G., which would be bumped to fifth place and is widely viewed as needing a new partner of some sort.
Deutsche Bank, which started much of the talk about German bank mergers last year by acquiring a 5.2 percent stake in Bayerische Vereinsbank, said it was pleased with the planned merger. Analysts said that was probably because the merger would not strengthen the hand of Commerzbank or some other powerful Frankfurt-based institution.

HEADLINE: Stocks Mostly Fall, Though Dow Is Up

BYLINE: By SHARON R. KING 

 BODY:
Stocks ended mostly lower yesterday, as nervous investors awaited the semiannual appearance of the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, before Congress. In his two days of testimony, he will detail the central bank's outlook on the economy.
Prices were also depressed, analysts said, as stocks reeled from a hangover caused by the Dow Jones industrial average's ascent above 8,000 last week and another decline in technology issues. 
 Despite the hand wringing of investors, the Dow Jones industrial average eked out a modest gain, ending up 16.26 at 7,906.72.
But the broader market indexes all ended lower, and declining issues outnumbered advancers on the New York Stock Exchange by a margin of slightly more than 2 to 1. The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 11.76, to 1,536.23, while the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 2.36 points, to 912.94.
Microsoft lost more than 3 percent, finishing at 135 15/16, down 4 9/16, as investors continued to sell in the wake of what some saw as disappointing earnings for the quarter ended June 30, announced last week.
Although the earnings were in line with expectations, Microsoft is known for returns that exceed market forecasts, said Robert Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers Inc. in New York.
Intel also finished lower, off 3/4, to 85 11/16.
The Pacific Stock Exchange technology index fell 3.01 points, or almost 1 percent, to 312.14.
But for the most part yesterday, equity investors were wondering what Mr. Greenspan will say today.
Several market analysts said they did not expect the Federal Reserve chairman to roil markets, given the positive combination of moderate growth and low inflation that the economy is now experiencing. But they all said Mr. Greenspan still had the ability to surprise investors and cause selloffs, as he did in December when he suggested that the market might be exhibiting "irrational exuberance." Since then, the Dow has risen nearly 24 percent.
Given how much the stock market has risen recently, said Thom R. Brown, managing director of Rutherford, Brown & Catherwood, a Philadelphia-based investment management firm, investors are "a little bit apprehensive about what Chairman Greenspan is going to say."
But he and other analysts said that if Mr. Greenspan merely said the central bank could raise interest rates if the economy grew too fast, then investors should not panic.
Among the stocks leading the Dow higher was Eastman Kodak, which rose 1 1/4, to 67 1/2. On Friday, the chairman of Kodak, George M. C. Fisher, said that he was not a candidate for the top job at AT&T.
One of the biggest gainers on the day was Signet Banking Corporation, which jumped 13 1/2, or 37 percent, to 50 3/16. First Union Corporation agreed on Sunday to buy Signet for $3.3 billion, or 3.5 times Signet's book value. The hefty premium marks one of the most expensive bank deals in history. Shares of First Union took a hit, falling 3, to 94 7/16.

HEADLINE: John E. Hines, Episcopal Leader, Dies at 86

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
The Right Rev. John Elbridge Hines, the 22d Presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church who guided the denomination through the social turmoil of the 1960's and helped open its clerical ranks to women and blacks, died on Saturday in Austin, Tex. He was 86 and had moved to Austin from North Carolina four years ago.
Bishop Hines had been bed-ridden and in declining health since breaking several ribs in a fall last Christmas. Associates said his condition deteriorated swiftly after a stroke in recent days. 
 His commitment to social justice prompted his elevation by the Episcopal House of Bishops to spiritual head of the church's three million members in an extraordinarily disruptive period. From 1965 to 1974, he pursued profound changes in the church's structure and its outlook.
He assumed his duties as Presiding Bishop of the Protestant Episcopal Church on Jan. 1, 1965, and at 54 he was the youngest man to hold that position.
As his predecessor, the Right. Rev. Arthur Lichtenberger had done, Bishop Hines kept his church in the forefront of ecumenical and civil rights movements.
He resigned at 63 in 1974, saying he was in good health but wanted to make room for a younger leader. At the time he was still pressing the church's law-giving body to allow the ordination of women as priests and bishops, an emotional issue since the 1970 convention decreed their acceptance only as deacons.
Presiding at church headquarters in Manhattan, he served as chief executive as well as pastor of the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul in Washington and representative to other denominations and the Anglican Communion.
Managing a large staff, he was accused by critics of overlooking administrative detail as he focused on social issues. He stood for liturgical renewal, the ecumenical movement and the promotion of minority members and women in church councils.
Lending a Christian perspective to the problems of racism and poverty, he responded to the urban riots of 1967 with a plan to reorder the Episcopal Church's fiscal priorities. He advocated measures to give the poor of the ghetto financial help with no strings attached, and with it political and economic independence.
His call for social justice and self-determination inspired a General Convention Special Program. Intended to purge his church of racism, the program accomplished much in the neighborhoods it served. But it was unable to enlist the rank and file and provoked dissent, leading many congregations to withhold money, which drastically reduced the church's national budget.
Bishop Hines nevertheless broke new ground in 1971 by taking his fight against racism to South Africa. He started a divestment campaign that spread to other denominations and American public and academic institutions.
Wielding the power of shareholders at annual corporation meetings, the movement persuaded some big businesses to cut back or shed their investments in apartheid-era South Africa. Bishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa said the movement played an important role in the demise of apartheid.
Bishop Hines brought the Office of the Presiding Bishop to its highest level of centralization. Many objected, but he never wavered in his conviction that the church had to take an uncompromising stand for the poor and defenseless and serve as an inspiration for others to do so.
When he left office before the end of his term, The Christian Century said he "remained astride the bucking bronco of a polarized church during one of the most controversial decades of American history." Many blamed him for drops in church membership, but since his retirement more national and local Episcopal bodies have engaged in the kind of social outreach ministries he propagated.
Bishop Hines was born in Seneca, S.C., and excelled in academics, athletics and student leadership at the University of the South. He graduated from Virginia Theological Seminary in Alexandria and filled his first ministry at the depth of the Depression in St. Louis.
There he came under the spell of Bishop Will Scarlett, one of the Episcopal preachers of a "Social Gospel" that sought to imbue American society with Christian values.
He was sent at age 26 to Georgia, where he attacked racism while starting his lifelong defense of those who lacked political, economic, social and educational opportunities. He moved to Houston in 1941 as rector of the Church of Christ and a builder of nationally reputed institutions, including a seminary, college chaplaincies and 41 new congregations. He became Bishop of Texas in 1955, and led his diocese through a racial integration of its institutions.
In retirement, he lived for nearly 20 years in North Carolina, staying out of the spotlight but occasionally preaching, lecturing and taking part in the consecration of bishops.
He was married to Helen Orwig, with whom he had four sons and a daughter, who survive. Helen Hines died last year.

HEADLINE: Learning to Love a Disaster;
The Edsel, With All Its Quirks, Is Hailed as It Turns 40

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON 

DATELINE: MIDDLESEX, N.J., July 19

 BODY:
Ted Girvan would not let anyone else drive his: the muffler is loose. Richard Jump worried about how much gas was left in his: the fuel gauge is broken. Bruce Paterson finally got the passenger-side door on his to stay shut: it did not close on the first try. Or the second, the third or the fourth.
"It takes a special finesse to close the door on an Edsel," Mr. Paterson said. 
 Only someone who enjoys shifting with a clunky push-button transmission would use the word "finesse" in the same sentence as "Edsel," or spend a Saturday afternoon at a picnic for a dozen hard-core members of the Garden State chapter of the Edsel Owners Club and the International Edsel Club. (Yes, there are two different organizations devoted to an automobile that has not been made for 37 years, and that became a chrome-laden dinosaur almost as soon as it rolled off the assembly line. One owner's group has scheduled its annual national convention for next week in Orlando, Fla., the other the following week in Spartanburg, S.C.)
As Edsel owners know only too well, the Edsel was a flop of such colossal proportions that its name quickly became synonymous with failure. It was not simply another road monster that hit the streets in the days of giant, gleaming tail fins and gas-guzzling engines that came in two sizes -- large and larger -- but the most spectacular failure from the Big Three automobile makers in the go-go years after World War II.
It had been introduced in 1957 with an expensive publicity campaign that included everything from full-color magazine advertisements to an hourlong television special starring Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and Rosemary Clooney. Edsels, which sold for between $2,200 and $4,000 and could seat six people in near-Barcalounger comfort, were supposed to compete with General Motors's mid-priced lines.
But after being on the market for only about three years, the Edsel was dropped. America had taken a look at the oval-shaped front grille and couldn't decide: was it more like a horse collar, a fish's mouth or, as Time magazine put it, "an Oldsmobile sucking a lemon"? The country snickered and and stayed out of the showrooms; psychologists declared the Edsel emotionally displeasing. Ford, Edsel's parent company, is said to have lost at least $125 million on its ungainly offspring, named after Henry Ford's only son.
Now, though, as Edsel owners prepare to celebrate the car's 40th anniversary, they seem to be having the last laugh. They love their cars -- the 5,000 or so that are still out there somewhere. They have learned to live with the ribbing they take from friends or relatives. They even repeat Edsel jokes, like the one Mr. Jump relayed today at the picnic at Mr. Girvan's house here. "God said, 'I gave them control of the air, the sea and the land, and what did they do? The Hindenburg, the Titanic and the Edsel.' "
But their passion is so all-consuming that they do not find Edsel jokes funny, their devotion so complete that the women among them talk about painting little E's on their fingernails. They are not dismayed by headlights that flicker, engines that overheat and transmissions that have been known to shift from forward to reverse without warning, while the car is moving.
And when the Edsel name is used in the same breath as other failures, they get angry.
When Plumbing and Heating magazine referred to a newly introduced product as "the Edsel of bathroom fixtures," Mr. Paterson, who is 46 and works for a plumbing and heating contractor in Garwood, N.J., grabbed pen and paper. "I actually wrote a letter saying, 'I take offense,' " he said.
And as for a Dunkin' Donuts commercial now seen on late-night television that shows the devil in the driver's seat of an Edsel?
"We're insulted," he said.
Some automobile historians say that Edsel owners have every right to be. "We've committed greater follies than the Edsel," said Jane Holtz Kay, the author of "Asphalt Nation: How the Automobile Took Over America, and How We Can Take It Back" (Crown Publishers, 1997). The Corvair? The DeLorean?
Michael Marsden, a dean at Northern Michigan University in Marquette, goes even further, arguing that the Edsel does not deserve its besmirched reputation. "Depends on who you talk to, of course, but design-wise, it was a car ahead of its time," he said. "It had a lot of good innovations in it." Edsel owners say the forward-thinking included a speedometer that could be set to warn the driver when he was speeding and idiot lights that later replaced gauges on other cars with one- or two-word messages like "service engine" or "door ajar."
Mr. Marsden said the Edsel's real problem was bad timing. "Had it come a little bit earlier or a little bit later, the car would have been a huge success." But it was introduced in a recession. A month after dealers began selling Edsels, the Soviet Union launched the first Sputnik satellite, catching the United States unprepared in the space race. Some sociologists say that because it was a behemoth that suffered from infamously poor workmanship, the Edsel fell victim to national soul-searching that followed Sputnik.
As if that were not enough, there are Edsel owners who find bitter irony in the fact that the man they hold responsible for the Edsel's demise went on to become a principal architect of American policy in Southeast Asia during the early years of the Vietnam War. Before he went to Washington, Robert S. McNamara, who was the Secretary of Defense in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations, had been a top executive at Ford. Edsel owners maintain that Mr. McNamara was no fan of the Edsel.
"Well, they're right," Mr. McNamara said in a telephone interview. But, he added, "Any of those who claim I irrationally caused its death had better go back and read history. There was absolutely no way it could have been saved, nor should it have been saved. It was a disaster."
Mr. Girvan is reluctant to admit it, but even he concedes that Mr. McNamara -- who shepherded the smaller Ford Falcon into being -- might have been on to something. "When you figure that the smallest Edsel engine got 8 miles per gallon," Mr. Girvan said, "that was a problem."
Other cars from the 1950's have become increasingly pricey collectors' items -- the 1953 Chevrolet Corvette and 1957 Ford Thunderbird, for example. But the Edsel, whose value as a used car in the 1960's lagged behind other cars from the 1950's, is still a relatively poor investment. "A lot of people think because you've got an Edsel, it's worth a lot of money," said Mr. Jump, a 36-year-old cook who was born 18 months after Ford stopped making Edsels. "It's still an Edsel. I call it the poor man's collector's car."
His own 1959 station wagon has had seven owners. Once it was raffled off, only to be rejected by the winner. Its next owner disconnected the battery and left it in a garage for 16 years, where Mr. Jump found it four years ago. It was his second Edsel. He already had a 1959 two-door hardtop.
"Even as a little kid, I always wanted an Edsel," he said. "For a long time my family would rib me on it, asking why I was putting all this money into this old car. I said, 'Look, I could have been an alcoholic, I could have been a gambler, I could have been into drugs. I can look at the car and know where the money's gone.' "
But on Saturday, he indulged in his Edsel obsession, trading leads on where to find windshield wiper blades, turn signals and tailpipes while Edsel club members had hamburgers and hot dogs at Mr. Girvan's house. Unlike Mr. Jump, some members were original owners. Dominick Rullo of East Brunswick, N.J., bought a 1959 convertible when it was brand new -- his car payment was $26 a month.
Four years later, he made what he still considers the big mistake: he sold it, for $200, to a cousin who junked it within six months. It took 20 years, but he finally found the blue-and-white Edsel he has now. The price: $4,500.
Mr. Girvan, who spent $1,200 to buy his car and $1,100 to have it shipped here from Champaign, Ill., has spent more than $10,000 restoring it, including a $3,000 paint job. Some Edsel parts are expensive. Mr. Girvan said that a hood ornament -- a chrome circle with an E in the center -- sold recently for $600 in Las Vegas.
To spend a couple of hours with a dozen Edsel owners is to take a crash course in automotive trivia. It is to understand why the owners of 1958 Edsels disdain the 1959's, the owners of 1959's disdain the 1958's, and the owners of the few 1960's that were manufactured have little use for the others. (All that really needs to be said is, the parts are not interchangeable.)
Edsels did not come in just any colors, they came in "president red" or "chalk pink." Mr. Girvan's hardtop, parked proudly on the lawn in front of his split-level house, is "spruce green metallic," a dark green that looks bluish from a certain angle, with "ice green" trim.
And then there is Roy Knapp's 9-passenger station wagon, with seats that seem as wide as some living-room sofas. The car, he said, is "jet stream blue" and "snow white" -- "without the dwarfs," he said, "though they could all fit in there."

Court Curbs Tax on Business

BYLINE: By TONY MARCANO 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
In a unanimous decision, the State Supreme Court ruled yesterday that business equipment and machinery cannot be taxed by cities and towns.
The ruling stemmed from a long battle between the City of Linden and General Motors Corporation, which sued the city for what it considered high tax assessments from 1983 to 1985 on its automobile plant. The state's highest court upheld an appeals court decision that the 1992 Business Retention Act, which says that equipment necessary to operate a business is exempt from local property taxes, does not violate the State Constitution. 
 The ruling was hailed by Joan Verplanck, the president of the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce, who said it would have been "disastrous" for economic development efforts had the court struck down the Business Retention Act. Edward J. Kologi, the city attorney for Linden, declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Upstate Glass Plant Agrees To Give Up Pollution Credits

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 21

 BODY:
State and Federal environmental officials have reached a tentative agreement with a major glass manufacturer that will require the company to significantly reduce pollution at a new plant in central New York and return to the state hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of so-called pollution credits.
The settlement removes a major obstacle for the company, Guardian Industries of Auburn Hills, Mich., to open a $120 million, 250-employee glass plant next year in Geneva, about 60 miles west of Syracuse. But the agreement, which was prompted in large part by a lawsuit brought by opponents of the plant, does not resolve a debate over whether the state should be giving away pollution credits to help companies expand or open within its borders. 
 Earlier this year, the Pataki administration gave the company 150 pollution credits, worth between $150,000 and $450,000, as an incentive to build the plant in Geneva. Under the Federal Clean Air Act of 1990, manufacturing plants must acquire a certain amount of the credits from other companies before they open. Guardian was having trouble purchasing enough credits on the open market until the state stepped in and provided some of its own.
The credits are awarded to companies or government agencies that keep their pollution below Federal limits, and they can be sold or traded on the open market. The credits essentially give companies permission to pollute.
Some environmental groups and Democratic legislators contend that the state should not be giving away its credits, but retiring them permanently to reduce future pollution. Indeed, the Atlantic States Legal Foundation, a nonprofit group, said today that it was suing the state to prevent it from giving away pollution credits as an economic incentive.
Under the agreement announced today, Guardian will return 125 of the 150 pollution credits to the state, said Gary Sheffer, a spokesman for the State Department of Environmental Conservation. The state can now turn around and give those credits to other companies seeking to expand or open here. The remaining 25 credits will be held by Guardian until the Geneva plant closes, when the credits must be returned to the state. The provision effectively retires the 25 credits for the lifetime of the plant, estimated at 40 years.
The settlement also calls for Guardian to reduce its emissions of nitrogen oxide, a component of smog and possibly acid rain, by 30 percent of the amount originally authorized by the state. It will set the strictest standard for nitrogen oxide emissions by a glass plant in the country and will become a national benchmark for future emission permits, New York and Federal environmental officials said.

HEADLINE: AT LUNCH WITH: Sheila Lukins;
Only in the Kitchen Are There No Letdowns

BYLINE: By ALEX WITCHEL 

 BODY:
SHEILA LUKINS fits best in the kitchen.
When she walks through the other rooms in her sprawling apartment at the Dakota, the ceilings are so very tall and she is so very short (five feet) you can easily imagine the place as a duplex. The formality of those rooms, despite their abundance of chintz, seems at odds with this intense, almost austere presence in black pants, white shirt and dark hair. 
 But in the kitchen, the woman who was a co-founder of the Silver Palate food shop in Manhattan, who conceived the recipes for five cookbooks that have more than 5.5 million copies in print, seems to grow. In spite of the requisite equipment -- professional grill, professional stove -- the room feels personal enough to be a teen-ager's bedroom. A picture of Elvis, a pitcher filled with sunflowers and two stuffed Campbell Kids dolls reside on the windowsill. On the counter is an array of bottles filled with olive oil, some greenish, some gold, some full, some not, clustered the way other women gather perfumes on the vanity; all at the ready, the perfect one waiting, to suit her mood. Or more important, her mouth.
"I feel so cozy in my kitchen," she says. "It's so familiar."
Cozy, however, is not the feeling Ms. Lukins exudes. It's more tense. Intense. Settled among the chintz in the living room, she shoots up when asked a simple question about why she covers the pan while frying chicken. Trekking down the hallway, she summons her assistant, Laurie Griffith, with an almost grim determination to prove, in stereo, that the chicken will not turn soggy. O.K., O.K. It was just a question.
"I take everything very seriously," Ms. Lukins says.
You would think that at 54, having established herself as a pre-eminent home chef and cookbook author (co-author of the Silver Palate books with her former partner, Julee Rosso), with her two daughters grown and happy and an apartment as big as Nebraska, she could take a little chicken in stride.
But things are not all they seem. In 1991, while Ms. Lukins was in her kitchen cooking a dinner for a charity event, she developed an excruciating headache, which caused her to lie down. She woke up in the hospital after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage so severe she was expected to die. The entire left side of her body was paralyzed and she developed an infection in her skull, which required a second operation. Finally, she landed at the Burke Rehabilitation Center in White Plains, where she spent three months relearning how to feed and dress herself.
The hemorrhage came while Ms. Lukins was in the midst of her first solo effort, "All Around the World Cookbook" (Workman, 1994), and although she could barely walk while recovering, she insisted on traveling to 33 countries to conduct research, accompanied by Ms. Griffith or her husband, Richard Lukins. She was in such bad shape that when she went to food markets in India or Morocco, she jokes, "they didn't know whether to ask me for money or give me money."
Still, she finished the book only three months past deadline. She then embarked on her newest, "U.S.A. Cookbook" (Workman, $19.95), which she describes as a celebration of American regional cooking. It was published in April, and 255,000 copies are already in print.
Yes, the story is a triumph, but at a price. Though Ms. Lukins can walk by herself now, her gait is a bit lopsided. She has not regained full use of her left hand, despite an experimental treatment at Baylor University in Houston, which fitted her for a wire-mesh glove that gives electric shocks to stimulate the nerve endings. And she and her husband have separated. Suddenly, tense makes sense.
"You ask me any question and I'll answer the way I answer," she proclaims.
Fair enough. Is it time for lunch yet?
Ms. Lukins and Ms. Griffith have prepared a gorgeous spread on the kitchen table, all from "U.S.A. Cookbook" recipes, and it tastes as good as it looks. It is almost impossible not to eat the entire plate of deviled eggs. Pulled pork in a burnished red sauce is also wonderful, served with homemade Parker House rolls, potato salad, picnic slaw and homemade bread-and-butter pickles. How Ms. Lukins stays so tiny is a mystery.
There's a smile. "Both Laurie and I taste," she says. "We don't eat that much. When I'm traveling, though, I do what it takes, and sometimes that means arches, if you know what I mean." The smile gets bigger. "They have great french fries."
She serves herself picnic slaw. Did she use a mandoline to get the vegetables so thin?
"No," she says emphatically. "I cut with a knife. I don't much go for gadgets. I have a Waring blender, coffee maker, juicer and an ice-cream maker. I'm pared down. We just test everything like crazy. I will kill myself to get a recipe right."
She will?
"Sheila is the Rodney Dangerfield of food," says Clark Wolf, a food and restaurant consultant in New York whose recipe for bruschetta is in "The New Basics Cookbook" (Workman, 1989). "She didn't get no respect. Because she and Julee wrote books that were fun and easy and accessible and sold millions of copies, all the food historians whose books sell 6,000 copies got very cranky.
"Sheila made a significant contribution for women who want to make a special meal and still be at the office at 9 the next morning. But it's taken a long time to get respect, as populist things do."
Even more populist than her books is Ms. Lukins's position as the food editor of Parade magazine, with a readership of 83 million, a job she inherited from Julia Child in 1986 and shared with Ms. Rosso until 1991. When Ms. Lukins ran a contest for best one-pot meal in 1995, she got 15,000 entries -- and tested most of them. The recipe for the winner, Wisconsin Cassoulet, which is made with maple syrup and brown sugar, is included in "U.S.A. Cookbook."
In a telephone interview, Julia Child said: "Sheila Lukins is a very, very good cook. I'm a home cook, too, so I think they're the best." While Miss Child said that she owned all of Ms. Lukins's cookbooks, she hastened to add: "I only use my own. But Sheila is right at the top of her career, a tremendous success. She should be very proud of herself."
Sheila Lukins was born in Philadelphia, grew up in Westport, Conn., and graduated from New York University with a degree in art education. When her husband's security guard business took him to London in the early 1970's, she went, too, studying at the Cordon Bleu while doing freelance graphic design for theatrical productions. The couple moved to Paris for a year, where she continued her studies.
After returning to New York, she opened the Other Woman Catering Company. Ms. Rosso, then an advertising executive, hired Ms. Lukins to cater a corporate breakfast. The two joined forces in 1977 and rented a Columbus Avenue storefront for $400 a month, and Ms. Lukins spent her days cooking Silver Palate dishes in her Dakota kitchen and running them over to the store. In 1988, the pair sold the business, which, besides the cookbooks, spawned a line of prepared foods like salad dressings and chutneys.
Last spring, Ms. Lukins signed on with United Airlines to upgrade its economy class meals, devising 17 regional entrees from her "U.S.A. Cookbook," including Shaker cranberry brisket and backyard barbecued roast beef. Robert Sobczewski, manager of on-board service for United, says: "Our food ratings are significantly up. They have exceeded our highest expectations."
What is most important to Ms. Lukins about the "U.S.A. Cookbook," she says, is that "it's about local ingredients, American ingredients." She continues: "There is no foie gras, and not a drop of lemon grass. I ate in diners and luncheonettes. When we went to Louisiana we didn't go to New Orleans. We went to Lafayette and danced with boys named Doris, eating in zydeco clubs."
For dessert, she has made chocolate pudding with homemade whipped cream. "Just a bite," she orders, knowing it will turn into more. It is spectacular.
The phone rings. It is Ms. Lukins's publicity agent, checking in. The author is on a short break from a daunting three-month book tour that is taking her everywhere, from bookstores to food fairs in 40 American cities. "Ever since I was sick, I really don't travel alone," she says. "I check into some hotels at 1 A.M. and have to get up at 4 A.M. to do a 5 A.M. TV show. I would say I need company for moral support alone, but the physicality is just impossible."
She looks out the kitchen window for a few minutes without speaking. She looks as though she might cry.
"I wrote about my illness in Parade and got letters from thousands of people who needed help," she says. "I sent a number of people to my program at Baylor. Those people are better now. I can only imagine that is why I got sick. To help other people. Why else would someone get sick at the height of their career, the height of their family? When I was in a wheelchair, one man wouldn't let me in his store. You can't imagine how lucky we are when we are whole. I was never empathic before. I am now."
But did she have to push herself quite so hard and quite so fast to finish her "All Around the World Cookbook?" Why didn't she ease up a little?
"My career has never let me down," she says softly. "It's the only thing in my life, except my children, that hasn't. Everything else has, including my health. Work is a constant. It gave me my independence back. I hated being dependent on everybody else when I was ill. I was so driven because I couldn't stand it. I used to dream I was fine, and then I'd wake up and it would be so horrible. I had such a great life, and I didn't want to get better and have a different life. I wanted not only to be alive but to have the same kind of life."
Her voice is rough. "If having a brain hemorrhage didn't kill me, then nothing will kill me," she says. "It was completely a fluke. I must have had 20 M.R.I.'s since then and they're completely normal, as if nothing had happened."
Beside being the year of her illness, 1991 was also the last time she spoke to Ms. Rosso. In a much-publicized fallout, Ms. Rosso, who moved to Michigan after the sale of the Silver Palate and started a newsletter, wrote to her subscribers that the publication was late because of Ms. Lukins's illness. Ms. Lukins was not connected to the newsletter, and when she protested, Ms. Rosso claimed that an assistant had written the comments and signed her name without her knowing it.
Ms. Lukins sighs. "It was really unfortunate for it to end so unpleasantly," she says. "It was so unnecessary, so silly. But there was no question when we did 'The New Basics' that that would be our last project together. We both wanted out of the Silver Palate, to have our own lives."
Ms. Lukins says she is not sure what her next book will be. She is still in love with her "U.S.A." food, as evidenced by an exploration of her refrigerator.
Hellman's Mayonnaise. Heinz Ketchup. A-1 sauce. Philadelphia Cream Cheese. Hershey's Chocolate Syrup.
Oh. It looks like everyone else's.
Finally, a laugh. "Mine is not a chef's book," she says. "It's a Sheila book."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Surges Against Mark As Greenspan Soothes Traders

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The dollar surged to its highest level against the German mark in six years yesterday, buoyed by soothing remarks from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, and a growing perception that Europe's planned single currency would be broad based and weak.
Mr. Greenspan told a House Banking subcommittee that United States growth appeared to be slowing and that he was confident of modest inflation through the end of 1997. 
 His remarks sent stock and bond prices sharply higher and lifted an already soaring dollar above the 1.82 mark threshold for the first time since August 1991.
"The risk was that Greenspan would come back and say there was a chance of increasing inflation," said Lizbeth Goldberg, assistant vice president of foreign exchange at Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechselbank. "He did not say that, the bond and stock market took off, and the dollar just followed."
In late trading in New York, the dollar rose to 1.8240 marks, up 1.5 percent from 1.7965 marks on Monday and the strongest level since July 1991. But the dollar fell to 115.15 yen, from 116.15 yen on Monday. The pound rose to $1.6790 from $1.6785.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks added additional fuel to a dollar rally against the mark, which began overseas because of mounting doubts about the strength of Europe's planned common currency, the euro.
These doubts increased on Monday, when a French budget audit showed that the country would fail to bring its budget deficit to within 3 percent of gross domestic product -- a required level for countries participating in the introduction of the euro.
Yesterday, German officials appeared to welcome French plans to increase corporate taxes and cut spending in order to get closer to the 3 percent target, while shrugging off the importance of meeting that precise level.
Without German insistence on a strict interpretation of the criteria for monetary union, many fear that a large number of countries will qualify, leading to a weak euro.
These fears were exacerbated when a Bundesbank council member, Hans-Jurgen Kobnick, told German radio yesterday that the euro could be stable even if Germany and France missed the targets.

HEADLINE: Immigration Angst

BYLINE: By Alan Wolfe; Alan Wolfe is a professor of sociology and political science at Boston University and author of the forthcoming "One Nation, After All," about middle-class morality.

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
Long before gays in the military became a political issue, Americans had adopted a "don't ask, don't tell" approach to illegal immigration. Immigrants did not tell because they did not want to be noticed. And the rest of us didn't ask because we knew the details of their passage would turn our stomachs. Some illegal immigrants would eventually realize the American dream, and then their story could be celebrated. But the American dream was not supposed to include forced labor.
The tales emerging out of New York of Mexican immigrants held in virtual bondage force us to confront realities of illegal immigration we would rather avoid. But now that we know what illegal immigration can mean, what exactly should we do? 
 Those who have always had their doubts about immigration will surely find in the news from Queens confirmation of their fears that immigrants undermine the American way of life. Ask those who hold this view what the American way of life actually means and they will often respond that it involves speaking English, working hard and believing in God. To this can be added living in freedom. That immigration has brought to our shores the kind of peonage abolished in this country long ago would seem to confirm the belief that allowing indiscriminate entry into the United States would corrupt our most fundamental values.
For defenders of immigration, by contrast, it was only a matter of time before someone, seeing the profits to be made by employing illegals as gardeners or shopping-bag packers, got the idea of making money by forcing them to peddle trinkets in the subways. To people who maintain this perspective, those who smuggled the Mexicans to New York City are different from agribusiness companies that employ illegal immigrants only in degree; both thrive by finding the cheapest workers they can. And workers cannot come cheaper than the truly desperate: deaf mutes, already cut off from the hearing world around them, condemned to obedience in a land not their own.
From this viewpoint, the lesson to be learned from Queens is that illegal immigrants are especially vulnerable to exploitation, which can be remedied only by allowing all immigrants to remain in the country legally.
Stories contrasting the wealth and opportunity of the United States with the downtrodden struggling against odds to make it here touch a nerve among Americans. Before the Mexicans there was the Golden Venture, the ship smuggling Chinese immigrants that ran aground off Queens four years ago.
But the very emotional power of these tales suggests why we should avoid drawing too many conclusions from them. Immigration policy is too important to the politics, economics and culture of the United States to be made by anecdote.
Moved by the plight of people barely capable of communicating their distress, we might decide that the nation has a humanitarian duty to help the vulnerable, especially those attracted to this country by the opportunities it offers. That would be a wrong conclusion. This was not, after all, a tale of wealthy Americans exploiting helpless immigrants, but of one group of immigrants exploiting another in a country to which neither belonged. Headlines in Mexican newspapers screamed about slavery in New York, ignoring the fact that their bosses were just as Mexican as the peons.
But even more important, sainthood is for saints, not policy makers. Just because people suffered greatly to get here, and then suffered even more after they arrived, is not by itself reason to allow them to stay. A society that extends its obligations to everyone extends them to no one. So long as some of our fellow citizens are in need -- and who can doubt that some of them are? -- they must have first claim on our conscience. Sympathy has to be rationed. As much as our hearts go out to people as vulnerable and exploited as the Mexican trinket sellers, our heads must insist that they be returned to their country.
Yet we would also be wrong to conclude from the events in Queens that we ought to be hard-nosed realists and close our borders. Immigrants have rejuvenated the American work ethic. Many of them are deeply religious, and they have re-invigorated American religious life. And they have brought vitality to many American cities. Several new American citizens were born to the deaf illegal immigrants in Queens. They may wind up being the fortunate in this unrelenting tale of misfortune.
At least in this country, conditions so alien to freedom do not survive once exposed to the light of day. Yet what happened in New York City is not a parable of evil or compassion. It is not a parable of anything. The very aspects of the story that make it newsworthy also make it atypical. We would be wise to allow the gut-wrenching emotional impact of these recent events to pass before deciding whether to tighten or further open our borders.

HEADLINE: Caterpillar Profit Advances 16% On Record Results for Quarter

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., July 22

 BODY:
Caterpillar Inc., the world's largest maker of tractors and construction equipment, today posted a 16 percent profit gain for the second quarter, exceeding expectations.
Caterpillar said sales and earnings in the quarter were its highest ever and forecast moderately higher results for the second half, compared with a year earlier. It said the world economic outlook continued to improve, but said it expected demand to weaken in Europe and Japan. 
 Even a forecast of moderate growth was "very extensive, very upbeat and for a second-quarter release very unusual for these guys to do," J. Blair Brumley, an analyst at Dain Bosworth Inc., said.
Earnings climbed 16 percent, to $435 million, or $1.15 a share, from $374 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier. The prior year's results were adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split.
The earnings surpassed analysts' expectations of $1.09 a share. But Caterpillar shares fell 56.25 cents, to $56.1875, as investors took profits following a strong run-up in the stock.
Caterpillar has been one of the best-performing stocks this year among the 30 component issues of the Dow Jones industrial average.
Revenue rose 16.5 percent, to $4.87 billion from $4.18 billion. Domestic sales climbed 20 percent, and international sales gained 14 percent.
"Their shipments continue to outpace the overall business of the industry," Lisa Shalett, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said this week. In the past, she noted, Caterpillar had cut inventories to become more attuned to industry demand.
When it reported earnings for the first quarter, in April, the company expressed concern about the dollar's strength against the yen, which raises the cost of Caterpillar's exports in terms of the Japanese currency, and the possibility that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates again. But the dollar has cooled off against the yen, and the Fed has not tightened monetary policy since March.

HEADLINE: Madelon Talley, 65, a Pioneer On Male-Dominated Wall Street

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Madelon DeVoe Talley, an investment manager who was one of Wall Street's first female executives, died Friday in a car accident near Wyndam, N.Y., her husband, Truman M. Talley, said. She was 65.
Despite a longtime interest in finance, Mrs. Talley did not begin her career until 1969, when she was in her late 30's and in the midst of raising three children. 
 In his book "The Go-Go Years," an account of Wall Street during the 1960's, the author John Brooks said Mrs. Talley was a "New York housewife who had tired of full-time housewifery," when she took a job as an assistant analyst at the Dreyfus Corporation.
A year later, she was named co-manager of the Dreyfus Leverage Fund, a promotion that made her the first female fund manager on Wall Street.
During her tenure at Dreyfus, which lasted until 1977, Mrs. Talley managed several funds, was a member of the firm's executive committee and earned a reputation as one of the sharper financial minds around.
During that period she also received a B.A. from Sarah Lawrence College.
"She had a lot of energy, talent and ability in the field, and did very well," said Howard Stein, the retired chairman of Dreyfus.
Mrs. Talley left Dreyfus to develop programs for the American Women's Economic Development Corporation, a joint venture of the Small Business Administration and the Commerce Department that aids women entrepreneurs.
Mrs. Talley said she took the job to hone her interest in small business rather than further an interest in business.
"Everybody in my family has started his own business," she said in a 1979 interview.
"My father-in-law started a paperback book company; my father started two businesses on Wall Street, and my grandfather started two businesses in Hoboken."
The call of the investment world was strong, however, and seven months after taking on her new position Mrs. Talley returned to it.
In February 1979 she was appointed New York State's director of the division of investments and cash management, a job that included the management of the state's $16 billion common retirement fund.
"Madelon Talley set the procedures and processes for the retirement funds, so that when the markets started to rise in 1982, when the Dow Jones industrial average was at 800, we were set," said Edward V. Regan, the former New York State Controller who hired her. "It was a very, very major contribution."
Mrs. Talley kept her Albany job until June 1982, when she left to join Rothschild Inc. as president of its asset management unit. She held the post for two years, leaving to set up a hedge investment fund for private investors.
In the last decade, Mrs. Talley devoted much of her time to writing about investing and serving on various boards.
From 1993 to 1995, she served as a governor of the National Association of Securities Dealers. In 1995, she was appointed a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. She wrote two books and numerous articles for a variety of publications.
At the time of her death, Mrs. Talley was vice chairman of W. P. Carey & Company, a real estate concern, a member of Alliance Capital Management's International Advisory Committee and a member of the board of the Joffrey Ballet.
"She knew our business as a customer and a vendor, and she did a great job for New York State by getting the state heavily into stocks in the early 1980's, which was the right thing to do," said Dave Williams, chairman of Alliance Capital.
A lifelong resident of Manhattan, Mrs. Talley was a 10th-generation New Yorker, her forebears having emigrated from Alsace-Lorraine in the mid-17th century.
In addition to her husband, Mrs. Talley is survived by a son, MacDonald W. Talley of Pacific Grove, Calif.; two daughters, Melanie Talley Whately and Marina Talley, both of Manhattan, and a brother, Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. of Sea Girt, N.J.

City's Jobless Rate Reaches 10 Percent

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
New York City's unemployment rate rose to 10 percent last month, up from 9.6 percent in May, the State Department of Labor said yesterday. Not since January 1994, just after the end of a deep recession, has the seasonally adjusted jobless rate been in double digits. The statewide unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.3 percent.
The new higher jobless number for the city has become a running theme in the current economic expansion: tens of thousands of new jobs in private business have been created in the city, but even more people have come out to look for those jobs, creating greater joblessness. Meanwhile, the number of jobs in government -- a large employer especially in some neighborhoods in the city -- has continued to contract. 
 Over the last 12 months, state officials said, New York City has added more than 45,000 jobs in private business and lost about 10,000 government jobs, for a net increase of 35,000. That accounted for almost all the growth in the eight-county metropolitan region tracked by the Labor Department -- the city's five boroughs plus Westchester, Rockland and Putnam Counties. Westchester, in fact, lost jobs over the last year.
The city's unemployment rate, meanwhile, has steadily risen, from 8.7 percent in June 1996 to its new peak reached last month. The unemployment rate in Westchester, by contrast, has actually fallen -- from 4.2 percent in June 1996 on a non-seasonally-adjusted basis, to 3.4 percent last month, the state said.

Start-up and low-fare airlines continue to remain out of favor for corporate fliers, despite savings.

BYLINE: By Edwin McDowell 

 BODY:
AFTER the Valujet crash in the Florida Everglades in May 1996, many travelers started booking away from not only Valujet, but also many other start-up, low-fare airlines. A new survey suggests that they remain out of favor with corporate travel managers.
According to the National Business Travel Association, a survey it conducted of 565 corporate travel managers showed that only 18 percent of them considered booking employees on low-cost or start-up airlines as a way to reduce travel costs. 
 With the last-minute fares typically used by business travelers hovering near record levels, corporate travel managers are using a number of methods to reduce costs, the survey showed. More than half of the managers surveyed said they encouraged the use of Saturday night layovers to get lower fares. Other methods include routings that might include a connection instead of a direct flight, or using secondary airports near their employees' destinations.
Barry Jagoda, a spokesman for the association, said more challenges might be coming for corporate travel managers. "As Congress considers more taxes and fees, the threat of even higher business air fares has led travel managers to consider a variety of measures to reduce air fares,"
 
Organic Fare
Swissair introduced organic food last month (including organic baby food) on all flights out of Zurich and Geneva, and Ulrich Wohn, the director of marketing services, said it had been a huge success. So successful, in fact, that by the year 2000 the carrier wants 90 percent of the food and beverages it serves in economy, business and first class to be organic.
This winter, Swissair will add organic salads, next summer it will add organic appetizers and soup, and in the winter of 1998-99, snacks, deserts and cold meals will also be organic. Inspiration for serving organic food, Mr. Wohn said, "came from our best customers, those who travel most."
 
A Reassuring Voice
They may never dispel the movie or TV image of the snarling New York taxi driver, yet visitors may find it reassuring when in a cab to be reminded by Placido Domingo, Eartha Kitt and Jackie Mason to buckle one's seat belt for safety, and be sure to take one's belongings and get a receipt at the end of the ride.
The other celebrity voices, on digital chips that are in many taxis already and required to be in all 12,000 cabs by Aug. 1, are Joan Rivers, Joe Torre, Dr. Ruth Westheimer and Judd Hirsh. The voices will be rotated every four to six months, although some of the original voices will return with new messages.
 
World Corporate Games
Time is growing short for those intending to compete in the World Corporate Games but who have not yet registered. Now in their 10th year, the games will be held in Aruba from Sept. 13 through Sept. 20, and participants must be registered by Aug. 13.
Texaco and British Petroleum have signed up, but the games are essentially corporate in name only, since any individual or any organization can also compete in any of six age categories. The 21 sports include many of the usual ones, plus bocce, dominoes, six-person soccer, table tennis and that favorite spectator sport of couch potatoes and other television addicts, beach volleyball.
Information in available by telephone at 954 767-3395 or on the World Wide Web (www.arubagames.com).
 
Auto Club's New Logo
Chartered 95 years ago as the American Automobile Association, that organization will formally become AAA, effective today. To mark the occasion, the familiar logo with the three red A's surrounded by an oval will also receive its fifth face lift, the first since 1983.
The new logo, with more contemporary lettering, will also be adorned by a blue ring apparently meant to suggest motion and progress. Over the next few years it will be converted on millions of membership cards, as well as signs at participating lodgings, restaurants and attractions.
The change, the association said, better reflects AAA's growth beyond automobile services to include travel, financial and insurance services. With 40 million members, 44 percent of whom are business executives, managers, doctors, lawyers and other professionals, AAA is indeed a powerhouse. It claims to be the world's biggest seller of American Express traveler's checks ($2.4 billion worth sold in 1996), the world's biggest travel publisher (300 million copies of travel-related books and maps each year) and it says that at any one time, 24 percent of all hotel rooms nationwide are occupied by an AAA member.
Meantime, AAA is not out of the auto emergency business. Last year it charged the batteries, changed the tires and otherwise helped out 30 million stranded motorists.

HEADLINE: Robust Economy Shrinks Federal Deficit

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
The Federal budget deficit shriveled to $10.87 billion for the first nine months of the fiscal year as a vibrant economy generated a record surplus for June, the Treasury Department said today.
The monthly report bolstered the notion that the surprising vitality of the United States economy could raise enough revenue to wipe out the deficit by the end of next year. 
 In June, revenues from taxes, fees and other sources exceeded expenses by $54.52 billion, topping the previous record surplus for that month of $34.34 billion in 1996, the Treasury said. In May, the Government had a deficit of $48.49 billion.
With the Government awash in unexpected cash, the deficit through the first nine months of the 1997 fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, has fallen 85 percent, to $10.87 billion, from $74.02 billion at the similar point in 1996.
Many economists expect the current fiscal year to wind up with a modest budget deficit of about $50 billion, after a deficit of $106.99 billion in 1996. They expect it to fade completely by the end of next year if current policy is left unchanged by Congress and the White House.
A budget deal including tax and spending cuts could widen the deficit next year, even though it would wipe out the budget shortfall by 2002. The last time the United States posted a budget surplus was 1969.
In June, outlays were $118.84 billion, down from $142.99 billion in May but up slightly from $117.66 billion in June 1996. Revenues rose to $173.36 billion in June from $94.49 billion in May and $152 billion in June 1996.

HEADLINE: Boeing Is Said to Give In to European Demand on McDonnell Deal

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, July 22

 BODY:
Hoping to avoid a bruising trade battle, the Boeing Company apparently capitulated today to a key demand by the European Commission in a bid to win approval by the commission of Boeing's $14 billion merger with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
One day before the commission, which is the executive arm of the 15-nation European Union, was expected to formally reject the merger, Boeing indicated a willingness to alter or drop its use of exclusive aircraft supply contracts with major American airlines, trade officials said. 
 The move came after weeks of fruitless negotiations that had threatened to escalate into a battle between the United States and Europe over control of the worldwide commercial aircraft market. The commission's threats to reject the deal had led American officials to vow to retaliate.
The focus of the dispute has been the exclusive supply arrangements, which Boeing has struck with three United States airlines. European officials say these arrangements pose a threat to the survival of Airbus Industrie, the European consortium, based in Paris, that is rival to Boeing in the commercial aircraft market.
Until today, Boeing had appeared unwilling to alter or drop those arrangements, as the Europeans had demanded. But late in the day, Karel van Miert, the European Union's top antitrust official, indicated that Boeing had sent him a new offer, signaling a willingness to do so.
"There is certainly a very important new element this afternoon," Mr. van Miert told Bloomberg News. "It seems Boeing is now ready to scrap the exclusive contracts. We are now looking at their latest offer, and we will tell you more tomorrow."
In Washington, Clinton Administration officials confirmed Boeing's concession and expressed hope that it would produce a peaceful resolution of the conflict. President Clinton, while not mentioning any specific details, predicted that a deal could be reached. "I think there is a way to work this out," Mr. Clinton said at a White House news conference, "and I'm hopeful that by Wednesday, when the commission meets, an agreement will have been reached."
Publicly, Boeing officials remained reticent. "We think we have done everything possible to reach a resolution," said Craig Martin, a spokesman for the company in Brussels, where the commission has its headquarters. "We are sort of stuck now waiting for the vote."
The vote on Wednesday is critical because the European Union has asserted its authority to reject the merger on the ground that Boeing is a major aircraft supplier across Europe. Although it could not technically block the deal, it could make it difficult for Boeing to do business in Europe by trying to impose fines of up to 10 percent of Boeing's worldwide revenues.
In addition to the exclusive contracts, a number of other aspects of the merger have drawn the opposition of the Europeans. Though McDonnell Douglas has seen its share of the commercial aircraft market shrink to less than 10 percent -- compared with about 60 percent for Boeing and about 30 percent for Airbus -- Mr. van Miert says that McDonnell's giant military business would in effect amount to a Government subsidy for Boeing.
American officials have pointed out that several companies in the Airbus consortium themselves have substantial military contracting businesses. And Boeing has argued that its exclusive sales deals are merely a refinement of long-term contracts that have been the norm for years in the aircraft industry, and that Airbus itself has tried to negotiate such contracts.
The Federal Trade Commission, in announcing its decision recently to allow the merger, said the long-term contracts did raise concerns but did not pose a sufficient reason in themselves to block the deal.
Until today, Boeing and the European Commission had made virtually no progress toward a settlement and appeared on track for a politically loaded trade battle. But with the scheduled vote less than 24 hours away, Boeing came up with its offer and a compromise suddenly seemed more likely. "There appear to be signs that the American side is softening," Germany's Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel, said after a briefing by Mr. van Miert. Saying a trade war should be avoided, Mr. Kinkel added that he had spoken with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright about the Boeing case on Monday.
White House officials have spoken by telephone with European officials, and Mr. Clinton said he had tried to speak with several heads of state. Joel Klein, the new head of the antitrust division of the Justice Department, has also been working behind the scenes with the White House's National Economic Council to nudge Boeing and the Europeans closer to a peaceful resolution.
United States officials have said that even if the European Union rejected the merger, they would continue to fight for the deal. The dispute would almost certainly be taken to the World Trade Organization in Geneva, which has the authority to resolve trade disputes and strike down government actions that it decides are merely protection measures that block free trade.

Fed Chief's Remarks Spur Surge in Bonds

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices surged yesterday and drove yields to their lowest levels in almost eight months after investors took comments from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to suggest that the Fed would not soon raise interest rates.
"The recent performance of the economy, characterized by strong growth and low inflation, has been exceptional -- and better than most anticipated," Mr. Greenspan said in his semiannual testimony before a House banking subcommittee on the state of the economy. 
 The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 1 21/32, to 102 26/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, from the price, fell to 6.41 percent from 6.54 percent on Monday.
Bond investors regarded Mr. Greenspan's comments as a clear sign that the Fed chairman was not overly concerned inflation would quicken any time soon.
"This is a huge sigh of relief for the market," Kevin McClintock, who manages $5 billion of bonds at the Dreyfus Corporation in New York, said of the market's activity after Mr. Greenspan's testimony.
Mr. Greenspan also suggested that there might be room for the economy to grow even faster without speeding inflation -- the nemesis of bondholders, since it erodes the value of bonds' fixed payments.
"From the Federal Reserve's point of view, the faster the better," Mr. Greenspan said.
Joseph Liro, chief economist at CIBC Wood Gundy Securities, said: "There's nothing on the immediate horizon that would suggest a rate hike. If the economy behaves itself, the Fed will behave itself."
Bond prices received another lift earlier in the afternoon when the Treasury sold $15.5 billion of two-year notes at a price to yield 5.93 percent -- less than the 5.94 percent many market participants had expected.
In contrast to yesterday's rally, bond prices tumbled on Feb. 26, after Mr. Greenspan used his House testimony to suggest the central bank was poised to raise interest rates to head off inflation. A month later, Fed officials lifted the target for overnight lending, by a quarter-percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
Few expected Mr. Greenspan would issue such a blunt warning in his testimony yesterday, and he did not. Reports in recent weeks suggest that the economy has slowed since the first quarter, while inflation is running at an annual rate of just 1.4 percent, the slowest in 11 years.
"Compared to his last testimony, these comments aren't nearly as bearish," said Mark Sauvigne, a five-year-note trader at Chase Securities. "He was much more concerned about inflation then -- it's a much rosier picture this time."
Fed officials next meet to debate monetary policy on Aug. 19 and again on Sept. 30. Judging from current rates on Eurodollar futures contracts, or dollars on deposit outside the United States, few anticipate a rate shift any time soon.
The securities are among the most sensitive to changing Fed rate expectations.Yet the September three-month Eurodollar contract recently had an implied yield of 5.75 percent, the same as the rate for three-month borrowing. That suggests investors see little or no chance for higher rates before the contract expires.

HEADLINE: Questions Grow Over Haiti Peacekeepers' Role

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, July 18

 BODY:
For nearly three years, ever since 22,000 American soldiers landed here to restore then-President Jean Bertrand Aristide to power, foreign troops have been an accustomed part of the Haitian landscape.
But with the mandate of a United Nations peacekeeping force scheduled to expire at month's end, their continued presence is rapidly becoming the focus of a broad national debate. 
 Barring a veto by China or Russia, the United Nations Security Council is likely to extend the peacekeeping mission through Nov. 30. Signs of fatigue are emerging, among both Haitians, who originally welcomed the American-led intervention in September 1994, and the countries that have since backed the peacekeeping effort here.
"There is a generalized recognition that this will be the last four months of the military component of the mission," Enrique ter Horst, director of the United Nations contingent here, said in an interview. But, he added, Haiti's Government, especially its fledgling national police force, "quite clearly will continue to require technical assistance" even after the military leaves.
[Citing "daunting political and economic challenges," United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan submitted a report on Tuesday to the Security Council recommending the four-month extension for what will now be called a "transition mission." After November, he said, it will remain vital for the international community to offer "strong support to the building of a professional police force."]
At the moment, the United Nations presence here consists of 1,300 Canadian and Pakistani soldiers and 250 police officers from several nations. The United States is not formally part of the current peacekeeping mission, but has a parallel force of about 500 soldiers that it calls a "support group." Those numbers are likely to drop only slightly when the mandate is renewed later this month, with the United States and Canada paying a larger share of the costs in order to satisfy China and Russia.
The jubilation that greeted the arrival of American troops is gone, replaced by a general indifference, a sense of disappointment or even, in some cases, outright opposition. Around the capital and in some parts of the countryside, graffiti have begun appearing on walls, proclaiming "down with the occupation" and demanding that "blan soldiers get out." The word "blan" means both "foreigner" and "white" in Haitian Creole and can have pejorative connotations.
Similar graffiti warnings were common three years ago, when a right-wing military dictatorship, which had deposed Mr. Aristide, was trying to avert the American-led intervention. This time, however, "popular organizations" on the left, most of which say they are loyal to Mr. Aristide but are not widely known, are issuing the threats. One such group has gone so far as to warn United Nations forces to stay out of its neighborhood after July 31.
Mr. Aristide, who exited the presidency last year after heavy pressure from the United States and its allies that he fulfill a pledge to do so, has muddied the issue by refusing to publicly endorse an extension of the United Nations mission. Instead, he has criticized the Government of his successor, Rene Preval, as being "indebted to imperialism" and accused the international community of trying to undermine the country's democratic forces.
"If they believe they can deplete the battery of our morale by programming hunger and a rising cost of living, they have miscalculated," Mr. Aristide said in one of several recent fiery speeches. Those arguments appear to be resonating among at least some parts of the populace.
"They have been here three years, but the economy is still a mess, and even though there are soldiers in the streets, the criminals continue to prey on us," said Hypolite Sanon, an unemployed resident of Cite Soleil, a sprawling slum on the outskirts of the capital. "If the foreigners cannot supply us with what we need, then it is best that they leave our country."
In an interview here, Mr. Preval said that though he recognizes that opposition to the United Nationspresence exists on both the right and left, he favors maintaining the mission for another four months. But he also indicated that when the next deadline comes, the "technical support" he wants could come under the auspices of other international bodies.
After November, Mr. Preval said, "one cannot exclude the possibility of bilateral assistance from the countries of the Caribbean Community," the 14-member regional group of predominantly English-speaking nations, which admitted Haiti as a member earlier this month. Jamaica in particular, he added, is a likely candidate to provide assistance in police and security matters.
The focus of much of the concern remains the Haitian National Police, which has been involved in recent incidents in which officers have used excessive force to quell demonstrations and have killed bystanders by firing wildly while trying to apprehend suspected criminals.
"For myself, it's not reasonable to ask this young and inexperienced police force suddenly to have to take over full responsibility for a safe and secure environment," said William L. Swing, the United States Ambassador here.
Beyond November, Mr. Swing added, "the responsible thing to do is ask what do Haitians want?" He added: "One needs to listen to people, take cues from the government and try to maintain some sort of international support group" that includes "a residual international security program."
But with the collapse of the United Nations-brokered accord in Cambodia and mounting concerns about the fragility of the Bosnian peace agreement, members are eager to avoid similar problems here. In addition, some countries have made it clear they are reluctant to do a job they view as primarily an American responsibility.
"Have we come to the point of diminishing returns?" one longtime United Nations official here asked. "I think locally the feeling is yes, despite their own apprehensions about the police not being up to the job."

HEADLINE: GREENSPAN UPBEAT BUT WITH CAVEATS

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, suggested today that the central bank was inclined to leave interest rates steady for the time being, but he issued a gentle warning that today's nearly perfect combination of low unemployment and scant inflation was too good to last forever.
Mr. Greenspan's generally upbeat assessment of the economy, although laden with caveats, dispersed lingering anxieties among investors that the Federal Reserve would raise rates next month to head off any possibility of inflation infecting an expansion that has lasted more than six years. 
 Coming hours after strong earnings reports from big companies like Philip Morris, Caterpillar and Pepsico, Mr. Greenspan's comments were seen as a green light on Wall Street, which sent stock prices to new highs. [Page D1.]
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 154.93 to close at 8,061.65. The bond market also surged, pushing long-term interest rates, which move in the opposite direction of bond prices, down sharply. At the end of the day the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond yielded 6.41 percent, its lowest level in more than seven months.
"The markets reacted to the notion that there wasn't any immediate threat," said Richard D. Rippe, an economist at Prudential Securities, "either in the way Greenspan perceived the economy or in what he implied about monetary policy."
But Mr. Greenspan's comments, Mr. Rippe said, contained a "clear implication that he thinks it's more likely that they will have to tighten monetary policy in the period ahead than it is that they would ease."
Speaking before a House subcommittee, Mr. Greenspan said prices were as stable as they had been since the 1960's. And he said that after growing at a 5.9 percent annual rate in the first quarter of this year, the economy cooled off considerably in the second quarter, dispelling any immediate fears that inflationary pressures might be building.
But he said growth appeared to be accelerating again. And he said the low unemployment rate -- currently 5 percent -- meant that wages might soon begin rising more rapidly, a development that would be good news for workers but worrisome to policy makers because many economists see wage increases that outstrip productivity gains as leading to broader price inflation.
"Unless aggregate demand increases more slowly than it has in recent years -- more in line with trends in the supply of labor and productivity -- imbalances will emerge," Mr. Greenspan warned on the first of two consecutive days of testimony he will deliver to Congress on monetary policy.
"We do not know, however, at what point pressures would develop, or indeed whether the economy is already close to that point," Mr. Greenspan said. "Fortunately, the very rapid growth of demand over the winter has eased recently."
To Wall Street, what Mr. Greenspan did not say was perhaps even more important than what he did. With financial markets storming ahead even as his words were being transmitted to trading desks around the world, there was no mention of "irrational exuberance," the phrase Mr. Greenspan coined last December to describe the stock market when the Dow Jones industrial average was 1,600 points lower than it closed today.
He gave only a veiled hint that he remained worried about the recent heights scaled by the market, leaving unspoken the idea that investors might benefit from a look back into history. "With the economy performing so well for so long," Mr. Greenspan said, "financial markets have been buoyant, as memories of past business and financial cycles fade with time."
Reflecting the strong growth rate of the first quarter, Mr. Greenspan said, the Federal Reserve has increased its forecast of economic growth for the full year by a percentage point, to a range of 3 percent to 3.25 percent, up from the last forecast in February. The Fed now expects growth in 1998 to slow to 2 percent to 2.5 percent, within the range most economists believe can be sustained without igniting inflation.
Nonetheless, the new forecast projects inflation to rise from a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent this year to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent next year. It assumes that this year's drops in food and energy prices will not be repeated next year.
Mr. Greenspan's testimony reflected the thinking of traditionalists within the central bank, including Laurence H. Meyer, a Federal Reserve governor appointed last year by President Clinton. They believe that low unemployment and strong growth almost inevitably results in rising wages and prices.
"I have no doubt that the current stance of policy -- characterized by a nominal Federal funds rate around 5.5 percent -- will need to be changed at some point to foster sustainable growth and low inflation," Mr. Greenspan said, adding that any such change should be seen as routine.
"For the present, as I indicated, demand growth does appear to have moderated, but whether that moderation will be sufficient to avoid putting additional pressures on resources is an open question," he said. "With considerable momentum behind the expansion and labor market utilization rates unusually high, the Federal Reserve must be alert to the possibility that additional action might be called for to forestall excessive credit creation."
But Mr. Greenspan also used his testimony to elaborate on his often-stated belief that technology, among other factors, might have helped change the economy in fundamental ways that would allow higher levels of noninflationary growth.
Although he emphasized that he remained skeptical of the idea of a "new economy," he said there was more evidence to support the notion that heavy investments by business in computers, telecommunications equipment and other technology were generating increases in productivity not fully captured in economic statistics.
"What we may be observing in the current economic environment is a number of key technologies, some even mature, finally interacting to create significant new opportunities for value creation," Mr. Greenspan said, citing such examples as the combination of lasers and fiber optic cable in transforming telecommunications and the mix of computer software and hardware that created the Internet.
'We do not now know, nor do I suspect can anyone know," he said, "whether current developments are part of a once-or-twice-in-a-century phenomenon that will carry productivity trends nationally and globally to a new, higher track, or whether we are merely observing some unusual variations within the context of an otherwise generally conventional business cycle expansion."

HEADLINE: Ruth Messinger Gets Specific

 BODY:
Ruth Messinger started her mayoral campaign in earnest yesterday with a speech on budget issues that dared to state some hard truths about the way New York City delivers its services. For the first time this year, it seemed possible that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani might have to do more in his re-election campaign than put price tags on Ms. Messinger's laundry list of worthy but costly projects.
In an address to the 14th Street-Union Square Local Development Corporation, Ms. Messinger answered those who had demanded that she explain how she would pay for the increased spending on schools and teacher salaries she has been calling for. Her proposed savings included targets seldom mentioned by Democratic or even Republican mayoral hopefuls, like the 35-hour workweek many city employees enjoy, teacher sabbaticals and "released time" that allows hundreds of workers to collect city paychecks while devoting some or all of their time to union duties. 
 Many of Ms. Messinger's other ideas for merging city agencies and for improving productivity by allowing private businesses to compete for contracts have been made before. Some proposals, like replacing police officers who do desk jobs with cheaper civilians, seem to come up on almost a weekly basis. But voters seldom get to hear a serious debate about their practicality.
Until now, Ms. Messinger seemed incapable of forcing Mr. Giuliani to defend his record as a manager. Her early speeches, which listed familiar complaints about crumbling schools and overcrowded classrooms, seemed meaningless without an explanation of where the money would come from to do more than the Mayor has done. Her suggestion that the city's teachers, police and firefighters be paid the same salaries as their suburban counterparts was unrealistic. Tactically it was an even bigger mistake, since she may have made Mr. Giuliani look like a tougher negotiator of union contracts than he has actually been.
The Giuliani campaign has violently disputed almost everything Ms. Messinger proposed, especially her claim that the ideas would save $1.1 billion a year. The Mayor also noted that her economies in the Police Department would require a smaller uniformed force. This sort of argument is healthy, and all Ms. Messinger's proposals should be debated in full. The city's unions should join in the debate too, along with the other Democratic primary candidates, Sal Albanese and Al Sharpton.
Ms. Messinger re-emphasized her commitment to activist government. But she added that 20 years in politics had taught her to value productivity too. If she can make her party, which is often captive to special interests, an advocate of government that is compassionate, fair and efficient at the same time, this campaign could be a valuable one.

HEADLINE: 5 Days in 1967 Still Shake Detroit

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, July 22

 BODY:
During this city's riots 30 years ago, Officer Isaiah McKinnon of the Detroit police was pulled over by an unmarked police car while driving home from a 12-hour shift spent trying to stop arsonists and looters from torching businesses and carrying off sofas, radios, even groceries.
Mr. McKinnon still had his uniform on that night and was one of the few black officers then on a police force so brutal and infected by racism that a routine raid of an after-hours club touched off the rioting. When Mr. McKinnon was approached by the two white officers who had stopped him for violating a riot curfew, he yelled that he, too, was on the police force -- to little effect. 
 "The older guy, he had his gun out and he made a racially derogatory comment to me," Mr. McKinnon said. "I could see that he was pulling the trigger. I dove back into my car as he fired, and I just floored it."
Much has changed since the night three decades ago when the white officer's shot missed Mr. McKinnon. City Hall, then run mostly by whites, is now run mostly by African-Americans. This city of almost a million people, which is 76 percent black, is the nation's largest with a black majority. More than half the members of its police force are black, and Mr. McKinnon has risen through the ranks from rookie to Chief.
But other scars from the riots remain. Hundreds of burned or looted businesses were never rebuilt. Tens of thousands of Detroiters moved to the suburbs, including many middle-class and affluent families. The city's tax base shrank and the quality of its schools declined.
City officials have found it easier to fix a police force under their control than to repair the economic wounds left by the riots.
Although public debate about the city's police force has largely disappeared, the struggle continues to rebuild what is also the nation's poorest big city.
"A lot has changed," said Detroit's Mayor, Dennis W. Archer, who is black. "The residents know and respect our officers."
But the Mayor acknowledged that other problems persisted.
"Whatever damage you inflict to your own city, it is likely to remain permanent," Mayor Archer said, "because in the very same areas where there used to be flourishing businesses, they do not exist today, and in the very same areas where there used to be dense housing units, they no longer exist today."
There were nearly four dozen riots and more than 100 smaller cases of civil unrest in the United States in 1967, but Detroit's riots were the deadliest. A Presidential commission later attributed most of the 43 deaths to police officers and National Guardsmen who, in the commission's view, had gone out of control.
The long-simmering anger of black residents at an abusive, mostly white police force erupted here in the early morning hours of July 23, 1967, and lasted five days. The flash point was a raid by white police officers on an after-hours drinking and gambling club at the corner of 12th and Clairmount Streets, in a heavily black neighborhood. By the time the smoke cleared almost a week later, 683 buildings across the city had been damaged or destroyed and tanks had rolled through the streets.
Whole blocks had gone up in flames, and the looting was so extensive that in some neighborhoods, alleys and sidewalks were lined with old sofas and armchairs that residents had cast out to make room for new furniture. Along 12th Street, smoldering piles of debris had replaced a bustling neighborhood of apartment houses, grocers, bars, a shoe store, a dry cleaner, a meat market and a bicycle shop.
Today, empty lots of thigh-high grass cover much of the area. Only one business owner at the epicenter of the riots, Carl Perry, still hangs on, operating a tiny photography studio next to a boarded-up storefront.
Mr. Perry's studio was here during the riots, too. Worried about looting, he moved all his expensive equipment into a drugstore he owned in the next block, where he served ice cream sodas to neighbors. Then a nearby grocery was torched, and the flames consumed his drugstore, destroying everything inside, including the expensive cameras and darkroom gear.
"It burned, it all burned," said Mr. Perry, who winced as he remembered the sight, even three decades later. "I didn't have one cent of insurance."
Mr. Perry, who is black, repaired store windows broken during the riots and kept his photography studio open. In the decades since, he has opened a small shop in the vacant storefront next door, and occasional customers buy soda, candy bars and potato chips there. But a grassy lot now occupies the site of his once-bustling drugstore.
Like other big cities, Detroit has never regained the prosperity it had in the mid-1960's, partly because of the riots' lingering effects and partly because of broad economic changes over which the city had no control.
For instance, jobs dwindled at the General Motors Corporation, the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, the Motor City's hometown employers, when the companies could not match the competition from Japanese auto makers.
But the riots exacerbated demographic shifts that had begun a decade before in many big cities. Around 1940, many Southern blacks, like various immigrant groups before them, moved to Detroit for the work in the automobile factories. The city's population at the time of the riots was one-third black, and by 1990 that percentage had grown to 76 percent.
Even before the riots, many middle-class Detroit residents, particularly whites, had begun moving to the newly built suburbs, commuting to work on the broad highways being built. But the riots turned the steady stream of people moving to the suburbs into a torrent. Businesses followed their customers. Thousands of houses were abandoned as the city's population plunged to 992,000 from 1.6 million at the time of the riots.
"We still have a huge inner-city problem in Detroit -- of housing, homelessness, joblessness, an incredibly decrepit education system, high crime rates, drug abuse, welfare dependency, teen-age pregnancy," said Representative John Conyers Jr., a Democrat who has represented Detroit since 1965.
One in 3 Detroit residents lives in poverty, compared with 1 in 13 in the city's suburbs. The median family income here was $22,566 in 1990, only three-fifths of the national median.
"All the statistics may have gotten worse in the last 30 years," Mr. Conyers said.
But there is some evidence that the city hit bottom some years ago and is beginning to turn around, particularly since the 1993 election of Mr. Archer, a pro-development Mayor who has concentrated on luring back suburban business leaders.
There are plans to build a new football stadium and a baseball stadium in the inner city, along with three casinos. G.M., the world's largest company in terms of sales, recently decided against moving out to the suburbs and bought a downtown office complex for its headquarters instead. Developers have built hundreds of new, middle-class homes in the city for the first time in decades.
Over the past 30 years, there have been a few hints of recovery near where the riots broke out. A strip mall with a supermarket, a drugstore and a bank opened with much fanfare -- and subsidies -- 15 years after the riots. A small subdivision of houses has sprung up in the last several years.
While economic progress has come slowly, the city has cleaned up its police force. In the process, the level of tension in the city has fallen sharply, civic leaders said, greatly reducing the likelihood of future explosions of violence.
The Detroit police used to be hated by large segments of the black community, and officers were viewed more as an occupying army than as keepers of the peace. Particularly notorious were what were called Big Four. These were squad cars carrying four officers, usually all white, and they inspired widespread fear.
The Big Four are remembered for their racially derogatory remarks and were widely blamed for beating up blacks who loitered on street corners or refused to obey police orders promptly.
"You might wind up with something upside your head" for not moving quickly, Mr. Archer recalled.
To be sure, some black residents maintained good relations with the police in that era. Esther Gordy Edwards, the sister of the Motown founder Berry Gordy Jr., said that when white officers were dispatched to Motown's headquarters on a residential street because of noise complaints, they often stayed to listen to recording sessions.
But many residents had very different experiences. In 1965, a then-former police commissioner warned prophetically that relations between the police and local blacks were so strained that a race riot could occur.
The old system hit its nadir during the riots, when many white officers proved too willing to shoot blacks. Police officers shot at least 20 people to death, and Army troops and National Guardsmen killed up to 10 more, according to Lyndon B. Johnson's National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, popularly known as the Kerner Commission. Of the 43 killed, all but 10 were black.
Even today, some black residents refer to the upheaval here 30 years ago as a rebellion against racist white authority rather than a riot. The site where the troubles began, 12th Street, was renamed Rosa Parks Boulevard in 1976, after the civil rights heroine from Montgomery, Ala., who refused to give up her bus seat to a white man and who later moved to Detroit.
But to Mr. McKinnon, the police Chief, the disturbance was a riot, and he and his predecessors have taken steps to keep anything like it from happening again. These days, there are far fewer citizen complaints, and they stem from isolated incidents, not accepted police practices.
The city's 4,072 police officers receive special training in handling riots. The city now makes elaborate preparations even for celebrations, like the Detroit Red Wings' recent victory in the Stanley Cup hockey championships. The police predict where crowds will form, map those neighborhoods using a grid system and then make each officer accountable for keeping the peace in a vicinity. Police officers face investigation if an unusual number of citizens complain about their actions, Mr. McKinnon said.
Mr. Perry, the only businessman left on the block where it all began three decades ago, remembered when that was not the case.
"We seem to be having a pretty good relationship with the police now," Mr. Perry said. "Before the riot, it was just a different day and age."

HEADLINE: ACCORD REACHED ON TAX MEASURE, REPUBLICANS SAY

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 22

 BODY:
House and Senate Republicans said tonight that they had resolved nearly all the differences between their respective tax bills and that they would present a united front in trying to reach a deal with the Clinton Administration.
The differences between the ways the House and Senate arrived at an $85 billion tax cut were substantial and had complicated negotiations between Republican leaders and the Administration on a compromise that President Clinton would sign. 
 But in agreeing to take a single position in the talks with the White House, Republicans adopted some positions that were closer to the House bill, which Mr. Clinton had made clear was unacceptable, and away from the Senate bill, which Administration officials had said provided a reasonable starting place for negotiating a compromise.
"We had a very, very good negotiation," House Speaker Newt Gingrich told reporters after the meeting. "We're very close to getting this done."
The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Pete Domenici of New Mexico, said the Republicans were ready to start discussing the issues with the White House on Wednesday. "We have reached sufficient agreement among ourselves," he said.
Republican leaders did not disclose details of the deal they worked out on the House and Senate bills. But people involved in the talks said it retained a provision in the House bill that would allow investors to subtract the effects of inflation in calculating their capital gains. Mr. Clinton said such a provision would lead him to veto the bill because it would cost the Government so much in revenue in coming decades that it could send budget deficits out of control again.
The Republicans also maintained their opposition to making more low-income working families eligible for a proposed tax credit of $500 per child. Mr. Clinton has pressed the Republicans on the issue, saying families making $20,000 to $25,000 a year who already benefit from the earned income tax credit deserve the child credit as much as families making more money who do not benefit from the earned income credit.
The unified Republican plan would adopt a position on the child credit between the House bill, which the Administration considers unacceptable, and the Senate bill, which is closer to what the White House wanted.
But Republicans said they had adopted a position closer to the Senate version on credits for college tuition.
The Republicans, however, apparently left unresolved two major differences between the House and Senate bills: whether to increase taxes on cigarettes by 20 cents a pack, and how to structure an extension of a tax on airline tickets.
Republicans said they hoped to begin full-scale negotiations with the Administration on the tax bill Wednesday and to send a bill to Mr. Clinton for his signature by the time Congress recesses in early August.
Republicans said they had decided against a strategy under consideration in the last several days of passing a tax bill even if there is no agreement with the White House and sending it to President Clinton, knowing he would veto it. Instead, Republicans said, they had decided to keep negotiating with the White House even if there is no deal by the summer recess.
Republicans said they might consider sending the legislation to Mr. Clinton if negotiations resolve most, but not all, of the differences between the Republicans and the Democrats.
The tax package is a centerpiece of the balanced-budget agreement reached by Congress and the Administration this spring, and if enacted, would be the first Federal tax cut in 16 years.
White House officials had no immediate comment on the Republican plan. But they have harshly criticized both the House and Senate bills as giving too much to the wealthy at the expense of working people and putting the nation's fiscal soundness at risk in coming decades through cuts that would explode in cost over the years.
Administration officials have made clear that they believe they would have the political advantage if the Republicans sent Mr. Clinton a bill that he vetoed, even if it meant a long standoff.
In closing ranks on the tax bill, the Republicans were clearly motivated to some degree by a desire to show that they could work together in the wake of a failed effort by some conservative House Republicans to oust Newt Gingrich as Speaker.
Among the issues certain to be vigorously debated between the White House and Republicans is the size of any cut in capital gains taxes. The Treasury Department today released an analysis that it said showed how the cost of the capital-gains cut proposal in the House bill would spiral out of control after 10 years.
The Treasury study showed that the House proposal, including the provision allowing investors to subtract the effects of inflation, would cost the Government even less in the first 10 years than Congressional estimates. But the study found that the costs would escalate to $196.6 billion between 2008 and 2017.
Administration officials said the Government would be particularly hard pressed to absorb such large costs during that period, because Medicare and Social Security expenditures would be rising sharply at the same time because of the retirement of baby boomers.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Greenspan's Report

BYLINE: By Dow Jones 

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from testimony yesterday by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, before a House Banking subcommittee: 
 The recent performance of the economy, characterized by strong growth and low inflation, has been exceptional -- and better than most anticipated. . . .
With the economy performing so well for so long, financial markets have been buoyant, as memories of past business and financial cycles fade with time. Soaring prices in the stock market have been fueled by moderate long-term interest rates and expectations of investors that profit margins and earnings growth will hold steady, or even increase further, in a relatively stable, low-inflation environment. . . .
The key questions facing financial markets and policy makers are what is behind the good performance of the economy and will it persist. . . .
In gauging the potential for oncoming strains, it is the effective capacity of the economy to produce that is important to us. . . .
Capacity itself, however, is a complex concept, which requires a separate evaluation of its two components, capital and labor. It appears that capital, that is, plant and equipment, can adapt and expand more expeditiously than in the past to meet demands. Hence, capital capacity is now a considerably less rigid constraint than it once was. . . .
Yet despite significant increases in capital equipment in recent years, new additions to labor supply have been inadequate to meet the demand for labor. As a consequence, the recent period has been one of significant reduction in labor market slack. . . .
The rise in the average workweek since early 1996 suggests employers are having increasingly greater difficulty fitting the millions who want a job into available job slots. If the pace of job creation continues, the pressures on wages and other costs of hiring increasing numbers of such individuals could escalate more rapidly. . . .
As I noted, the recent performance of the labor markets suggests that the economy was on an unsustainable track. Unless aggregate demand increases more slowly than it has in recent years -- more in line with trends in the supply of labor and productivity -- imbalances will emerge. . . .
Fortunately, the very rapid growth of demand over the winter has eased recently. To an extent this easing seems to reflect some falloff in growth of demand for consumer durables and for inventories to a pace more in line with moderate expansion in income. But some of the recent slower growth could simply be a product of abnormal weather patterns, which contributed to a first-quarter surge in output and weakened the second quarter, in which case the underlying trend could be somewhat higher than suggested by the second-quarter data alone. Certainly, business and consumer confidence remains high and financial conditions are supportive of growth. Particularly notable is the run-up in stock market wealth, the full effects of which apparently have not been reflected in overall demand, but might yet be. . . .
I have no doubt that the current stance of policy -- characterized by a nominal Federal funds rate around 5 1/8 -- will need to be changed at some point to foster sustainable growth and low inflation. Adjustments in the policy instrument in response to new information are a necessary and, I should like to emphasize, routine aspect of responsible policy making. For the present, as I indicated, demand growth does appear to have moderated, but whether that moderation will be sufficient to avoid putting additional pressures on resources is an open question. With considerable momentum behind the expansion and labor market utilization rates unusually high, the Federal Reserve must be alert to the possibility that additional action might be called for to forestall excessive credit creation. . . .

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, excerpts in Business Day yesterday from testimony given by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, misstated a figure used by Mr. Greenspan for the Federal funds rate. He noted that the nominal Federal funds rate was around 5 1/2 percent, not 5 1/8 percent.

HEADLINE: Stocks Rally On Comments By Greenspan

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
Stocks soared to record levels again yesterday after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told investors just what they wanted to hear: There is no imminent threat of a rise in interest rates.
In his upbeat assessment of the economy before Congress, Mr. Greenspan also failed to caution investors about "irrational exuberance" or "excessive optimism" in the financial markets -- as he had in earlier comments -- choosing instead to emphasize the strength of the economy and its long-term prospects. 
 "What many investors were saying today was that Mr. Greenspan has a view that is not very different from theirs: The U.S. economy is competitive, it's generating profits and jobs, but at this point it's not generating inflation," said Abby Joseph Cohen, co-chairwoman of the investment policy committee at Goldman, Sachs & Company. And, she added, "what really drives the equity market is confidence in the durability of earnings."
After slumping for several sessions, stocks were rallying even before the Fed chairman spoke yesterday because of strong earnings performances. But Mr. Greenspan's remarks propelled share prices even higher.
The Dow Jones industrial average soared 154.93 points, or 1.96 percent, to 8,061.65, a new closing high. That gain puts the blue-chip average up 25 percent this year, or more than 1,600 points higher than it was in early December, when Mr. Greenspan first warned of the possibility of "irrational exuberance" in the stock market.
Broader measures also ended higher. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index surged 21.04 points, or 2.3 percent, to a record 933.98. And the Nasdaq composite rose 27.63 points, or 1.8 percent, to 1,563.86. In the bond market, the yield on the 30-year Treasury tumbled 13 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.41 percent, its lowest level of the year.
In effect, Mr. Greenspan's comments yesterday affirmed what many on Wall Street have been saying for some time: that the economy is in a "sweet spot," bolstered by robust economic growth, low inflation and soaring earnings. That combination, analysts said, has made stocks an increasingly attractive investment.
Indeed, Ms. Cohen said that investors and the Fed were coming to terms with a dynamic new economy, one that was being driven by a technology revolution, greater productivity and, right now, an elongated economic cycle -- what she called a "Silly Putty cycle."
"What we're talking about is a huge structural transformation of the economy," she said. "The average experiences of previous cycles don't hold. Inflation does not rise as easily and economic growth lasts longer. In other words, many of the assumptions that investors use have been torn asunder."
Indeed, such gains in productivity have spurred rising profit margins, many of which were on display yesterday. For instance, there were strong earnings reports yesterday from Walt Disney and Philip Morris, Dow component companies, as well as Warner-Lambert and RJR Nabisco Holdings.
"Today, we've gotten encouragement on all fronts," said Hugh Johnson, a market analyst at the First Albany Corporation. "It's been a very good earnings season. And then we have Greenspan's comments, and he's telling Congress: 'you really couldn't ask for a better economic backdrop.' "
Indeed, stocks were higher in early, but subdued, trading before Mr. Greenspan's testimony. The Dow was up about 55 points just before 2 P.M. Shortly thereafter, when news agencies transmitted accounts of his remarks, the financial markets rocketed higher.
"Mr. Greenspan's remarks hit the wires around 2 P.M., then the bonds jumped more than a point, the stock futures picked up and then it just ran the market," said Richard Cripps, a market analyst at Legg Mason in Baltimore. "The market seems to be in celebration rather than anticipation. We already had the Goldilocks view of the economy, and now Greenspan has given people the view that monetary policy is on hold."
With the economy in such a Goldilocks phase -- not too hot, not too cold, just right -- investors returned yesterday to many of the banking, drug and technology issues that have led the market higher this year.
Of the Dow's 30 component stocks, 28 gained yesterday, led by Du Pont, up 3 3/8 a share, to 66 3/16; Chevron, up 2 3/4, to 77 5/8, and Disney, up 2 7/16, to 77 5/8. Caterpillar lost 9/16, to 56 3/16, while Philip Morris, the Big Board's most actively traded issue, rose 2 1/8, to 42 5/8.
Among drug stocks, Warner-Lambert rose 3, to 142 1/2; in technology issues, Microsoft was the powerhouse, up 8 5/16, to 144 1/4. RJR Nabisco rose 1 1/16, to 30 7/8.
On the Big Board, advancing issues outpaced decliners, 2,094 to 842; volume was heavy at 580 million shares.
While many on Wall Street were expecting Mr. Greenspan to paint a rosy picture of the economy, many also feared that even the slightest dose of criticism yesterday might rattle the markets. But there was none of that.
Donald Fine, the chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management, said: "No one was expecting the Fed to tighten any time soon. But this removed any fear, and the market took off. After listening to his testimony, the risk of investors being wrong was greatly reduced."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
As the Dollar Keeps Rising, 'The Trend Is Your Friend'

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar reached another six-year high against the German mark yesterday and rose in most other dealings after top officials from the Bundesbank and the Federal Reserve signaled that they did not oppose the dollar's latest ascent.
Momentum from Tuesday's gains also helped carry it higher. Many traders bought dollars, fearing that they might miss a profitable opportunity. "We haven't broken out of the bullish trend," said Thomas Lapinski, chief dealer at the MTB Bank Corporation in New York. "You don't want to stand against the train coming at you. The trend is your friend." 
 The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.8325 marks, the strongest since July 1991, before settling in New York at 1.8268 marks, up from 1.8240 late Tuesday. The dollar rose to 115.65 yen from 115.15 yen. The British pound fetched $1.6804, up from $1.6790.
Traders said the dollar got an early boost from remarks by Guntram Palm, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council, who said that its strength against the mark does not create the risk of higher German inflation.
Although the dollar's strength could raise import prices, Mr. Palm said the effects were offset by Germany's weak economy, high unemployment and slow-growing money supply, which have discouraged spending.
His comments were widely viewed as a sign that German monetary policy makers were willing to let the mark weaken against the dollar as long as the decline is orderly. The weak mark could help stimulate German exports and help the economy grow.
Robert Fullem, a trader at NatWest Markets in New York, put it this way: "If you were a Bundesbank council member and you had a high unemployment rate and no inflation and were trying to get the economy to move forward, what are you going to do? There's no reason to have the mark strengthen."
Later, the dollar got further help from a second day of positive comments about the United States economy from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. He called the combination of steady growth and low inflation exceptional, with no mention of the dollar's strength as a possible risk.

HEADLINE: Concession With Little Immediate Effect

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT 

 BODY:
The Boeing Company's concession to European Union officials -- giving up exclusive 20-year contracts to supply aircraft to American, Delta and Continental airlines in return for approval of the acquisition of the McDonnell Douglas Corporation -- will have little practical effect for years to come, industry experts said yesterday.
After all, the airlines, having placed orders for the next 20 years, still want the aircraft they have ordered for the foreseeable future. And there are powerful incentives to remain with one manufacturer, including reduced training costs for pilots and mechanics, and the lower costs associated with carrying inventories of spare parts for only one brand of aircraft. 
 Boeing acceded to European demands that the exclusivity clauses be dropped so that Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that is Boeing's biggest rival, would not be frozen out of competition for new orders for so many years. However, Airbus or any other potential competitors to Boeing would have to offer strong incentives to airlines to complicate their fleets with new aircraft types.
"That will be a powerful force in deterring the airlines from making any radical changes," said Edmund S. Greenslet, an industry analyst who runs ESG Aviation Services in Ponte Verde Beach, Fla. "It's going to be a tough sell, but not an impossible sell."
But, he added, "For the next five years, even 10 years, I don't think it means anything."
Beyond that time, though, the Boeing concession appears to be a slight positive for Airbus and the airlines that signed the agreements with Boeing, and a slight negative for Boeing itself.
The airlines will continue to hold on to the steep discounts they received for new aircraft in return for wedding themselves to Boeing. At the same time, they are free to consider new offerings from other manufacturers before the end of their 20-year contracts.
"Now we get the best of both worlds," said Gordon M. Bethune, chairman of Continental Airlines.
In a news conference in Washington yesterday, Philip M. Condit, Boeing's chairman, said that Boeing had been reluctant to give up the exclusivity clauses, although he said that Boeing expected the change to have little impact on aircraft orders.
"Given this agreement, we can have, if not zero impact, then minimal impact on the bottom line," Mr. Condit said.
To the degree that removing the exclusivity clause on its contracts chips away at the competitive advantage of Boeing, the change benefits Airbus.
Airbus had feared the 20-year contracts for good reason. In practical terms, by the time an airline had moved to an all-Boeing fleet after 20 years, any airline would be reluctant to start carrying the additional costs associated with bringing in new plane types.
"Exclusive deals are not for 20 years, they are for eternity," Jean Pierson, managing director of Airbus, said at the recent air show in Paris.
Now, Airbus will at least have an opportunity to make sales pitches to top airline executives, particularly when leadership at AMR's American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Continental changes over the next two decades.
That thinking was reflected when Airbus mounted an aggressive public relations campaign against Boeing's long-term contracts following Delta's announcement of the Boeing deal in March.
John J. Leahy, an Airbus senior vice president, contended at the time that the contracts deprived airline investors of a chance to get an even better deal in the future.
"Airline managements in the future are going to wonder what their predecessors got them into," Mr. Leahy said.

HEADLINE: New York's Prison Building Fever

 BODY:
The battle over prison construction is one of the remaining disputes holding up New York State's budget. Gov. George Pataki, trying to prove he can be tough on crime, had proposed to build 7,000 new prison beds over three years at a cost of about $635 million. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver says only 800 new beds are necessary. For several reasons, the Speaker is more right than the Governor.
Mr. Pataki says more prison beds are needed to handle an increasing number of violent offenders. But the jail population of New York City, which supplies the majority of state prison inmates, has been declining, and 60 percent of those sent to state prisons last year had been convicted of nonviolent crimes. That would seem to justify reversing New York's expensive habit of building more and more prisons. The state could use existing cells more effectively if Mr. Pataki would push for reform of mandatory sentencing laws that force the courts to imprison many nonviolent offenders who might be handled more cheaply outside and to keep some offenders in prison much longer than necessary. 
 Mr. Silver proposes that the state build only 800 new maximum-security beds and supplement that with 800 new drug treatment beds to try to wean addicts from their habit. That targets two specific areas of need -- more space for some of the toughest inmates and treatment for those with serious drug problems.
Mr. Pataki seems more interested in grandstanding on the crime issue or satisfying upstate legislators who see prisons as economic development engines for their districts. By holding up the budget for a misguided response to crime, Mr. Pataki does the state a double disservice, harming both the budget and the criminal justice system.

HEADLINE: 3M Earnings Increase 9.7% But Fall Short of Expectations

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: ST. PAUL, July 23

 BODY:
The Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company said today that earnings rose 9.7 percent in the second quarter, slightly less than analysts expected, as the strong dollar and new-product costs cut into higher sales.
The company's financial health is often considered a benchmark for the economy because of the manufacturer's large and diverse base of consumer and commercial products. 
 Net income at 3M, whose products include Post-It brand notes and Scotch brand tape, rose to $418 million, or $1.01 a share, from $381 million, or 91 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.
The per-share results fell short of the $1.03 that analysts, on average, had expected. On the New York Stock Exchange, 3M declined $1.875, to $98.4375.
Sales increased 8.4 percent, to $3.82 billion from $3.52 billion.
While sales in the United States and abroad were better than expected, rising 10 percent in this country and 15 percent internationally, the dollar's strength reduced earnings by 5 cents a share. As the dollar rises, sales denominated in other currencies produce less American currency.
International prices dropped 1 percent, and costs increased because of investments in the Pacing Plus new-products program, 3M said.
Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said, "Revenue beat our forecasts handily due to strong international volume growth, implying the company must have had a very strong June." Operating profit margins were not as strong as expected, he said, because of the dollar's strength and the cost of the new products.
The manufacturer said both of its two major product sectors -- industrial and consumer products and life sciences -- did well.
Research and development costs increased $20 million from a year ago as 3M stepped up production of brightness-enhancement film, which is used on laptop computer screens, as well as chemicals that replace chlorofluorocarbons. Both are part of the Pacing Plus program, which speeds development of products that 3M believes have the potential for large sales and profits.
The company said it expected strong growth to continue in the second half despite the impact of currency conversions.

Bond Prices Dip on Sale Of New Notes

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices fell slightly yesterday after what traders called an expensive auction of new five-year notes.
The second day of Congressional testimony from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, had little effect on bonds. 
 Mr. Greenspan repeated the favorable assessment of the economy and inflation that on Tuesday spurred the biggest bond rally since October. He added yesterday that long-term yields were high relative to inflation. Some investors took those comments as a sign that bonds could rally further.
Laurence H. Meyer, a Federal Reserve governor, and Alice Rivlin, the Fed vice chairwoman, also testified before Congress yesterday and gave optimistic assessments of the outlook for growth and inflation.
"Life is good right now," with moderate growth and low inflation making a good environment for bonds, said Alan Day, who manages $900 million at Stratevest Group in Burlington, Vt.
Still, the price of the benchmark 30-year bond fell 9/32, to 102 18/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.43 percent, from 6.41 percent on Tuesday.
Bonds gave back early gains after the Treasury sold $11.5 billion in five-year notes at a yield of 6.024 percent, below traders' expectations. That raised concern that Wall Street firms that bid on the notes might have a tough time finding buyers for the securities.
"It came too expensive," said Bill Kirby, a trader at Prudential Securities Inc., one of the 39 primary dealers required to bid at Treasury debt sales.
On Tuesday, bond prices surged after Mr. Greenspan said the economy was on an "exceptional" path of strong growth and slow inflation, easing worries about an imminent increase in interest rates. He repeated those remarks to the Senate Banking Committee yesterday, concluding his semiannual testimony to Congress.
His comments cheered investors because many were bracing for the usually cautious central banker to sound an alarm about the dangers of future inflation.
Instead, "Greenspan basically came out and said they won't be tightening in the near future," said Jim Madelmayer, a trader at Dresdner Securities Inc. "The market will continue to do better."
The Fed last raised rates in March, increasing its target for the Federal funds rate by a quarter percentage point to 5.5 percent.
Still, some investors said there was little fresh incentive to buy Treasury securities at the highest prices this year.
"A lot of good news is already priced into the market," which may curb further gains, said David Schroeder, who manages $2 billion in bonds for American Century Benham in Mountain View, Calif.
In the corporate bond market, the McDonald's Corporation, the Riverwood International Corporation and PT Polysindo EKA Perkasa, a textile company in Indonesia, sold a combined $650 million of bonds as companies rushed to take advantage of the recent rally in Treasury securities.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of new five-year notes:

HEADLINE: Greenspan Silence on Stocks Speaks Volumes to Investors

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 23

 BODY:
He was concerned about the lofty level of stock prices when the Dow was at 6,400 late last year. But when Alan Greenspan assessed the economy for Congress this week, he hardly mentioned Wall Street -- never mind that stocks were bursting through 8,000.
So what changed? 
 Through his silence this week about the risks of a stock-price bubble, Mr. Greenspan may have been conceding that the market was right after all. What's more, he appeared to acknowledge that he, the all-powerful chairman of the Federal Reserve, was wrong in December when he coined the phrase "irrational exuberance" to describe investor psychology.
Certainly, investors took it that way. Stocks rallied to a high after his statements on Tuesday and rose again, though with less vigor, today, in part because Mr. Greenspan waved no red flags and characterized the economy as humming along at a near-perfect pitch.
Analyzing Mr. Greenspan's thinking from afar can be a perilous business, but many economists believe that Mr. Greenspan's concerns have been assuaged by the strong profits American businesses have enjoyed this year, making stock prices relative to earnings less inflated than they might have seemed.
Which is not to say that stock prices could not still crash, or that they are certain to go on rising. Or that Mr. Greenspan was not justified in exploring the question of how a booming market -- or a crashing one -- might affect the economy and monetary policy.
But the strong corporate earnings performance appears to meet the test that Mr. Greenspan laid out when he sought to explain his "irrational exuberance" comments during testimony in March.
"Analytically," Mr. Greenspan said at the time, "current stock-price valuations at prevailing long-term interest rates could be justified by very strong earnings growth expectations."
Since then corporate America has posted robust increases in profits, generated for the most part by solid improvements in sales and productivity rather than by financial gimmicks.
"Greenspan said earlier this year that he'd accept the view that stocks are reasonably priced if we saw that expected profits or profit margins were ultimately realized," said David Jones, an economist at Aubrey Lanston & Company in New York. "That's precisely what happened. He set up the criteria and essentially they were met."
To some extent, Mr. Greenspan may have been reticent to raise the subject again because of the storm of criticism that showered down on him after his statements in December. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, asked whether the Federal Reserve's independence needed to be reviewed. Economists wondered why Mr. Greenspan, a strident free marketer, was questioning the efficiency of the financial markets. And many small investors asked what business the Fed chairman had trying to talk down the value of their portfolios.
"There's no question he was smarting from the criticism," Mr. Jones said.
But economists who follow the debates within the Federal Reserve and speak to officials there said Mr. Greenspan also seemed to change his outlook gradually during the winter and spring. They said he had asked a lot of questions about corporate profits and spent a lot of time studying reports about strong earnings and low inflation. His thinking may also have changed after the market fell by almost 10 percent in March and April and then promptly rebounded with no apparent damage to the economy, the financial system or investor confidence.
"Suddenly he was less warlike on the stock market's elevation, and even his concerns about the inflation threat seemed to become more muted this spring and summer," said Lawrence Kudlow, an economist at the American Skandia Life Assurance Corporation.
Mr. Greenspan's thinking may have been influenced by research suggesting that stock prices were not excessively high by historical standards when the climate of low inflation and steady growth were taken into account along with strong profits. Mickey D. Levy, an economist at Nationsbank in New York, developed a model -- taking account of measures of earnings growth, inflation, interest rates and stock-return volatility -- that concluded that equity valuations "are broadly consistent with the fundamentals."
Similarly, Allan H. Meltzer, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University and the American Enterprise Institute, compared valuations during periods of strong growth and low inflation with periods of slow growth and high inflation. He found that current valuations were more or less in line with those of other eras of strong growth and low inflation.
"Both the quality and the quantity of profits are increasing at a pretty steep rate," Mr. Meltzer said. "Even if profits were to level off, you wouldn't get a huge drop in the stock market."
If the outlook for corporate profits has improved, it would support the theory floated by Mr. Greenspan, most recently during his testimony this week, that big investments in technology by businesses were paying off with productivity gains. Increased productivity would not only help explain and support higher corporate profits but would also help explain why the economy has been able to grow steadily without inflation -- even though unemployment has fallen well below the levels at which rising prices have historically started to destabilize the economy.
Mr. Greenspan made clear that he was not yet ready to accept that theory in whole, and other Fed officials continued to argue that the old rules governing the relationship between inflation, unemployment and growth have not changed. But three of the Fed's key policy makers, in their own Congressional testimony today, agreed with Mr. Greenspan that the path ahead, while not without some risks, is as clear as any central banker is willing to concede.
"The economy as a whole is functioning amazingly well," said Alice M. Rivlin, the Fed's vice chairwoman.
And Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, was even more upbeat. "The performance of this 'good news' economy," he said, "is enough to make you want to cheer."

HEADLINE: Maidenform's Problems Reflect Industry Pitfalls

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
In the world of apparel, few things are as complicated as a bra. It may have 20 pieces and come in more than a dozen sizes and colors. Fit is extremely important -- no woman is going to buy a bra and take it to her tailor to have it altered. All of this makes production a real headache.
Production, far removed from the shopper's eye, is what most likely led to the downfall of Maidenform Worldwide Inc., which filed for protection under Chapter 11 on Tuesday night, and could threaten other intimate-apparel companies that do not keep an eye on the back office. 
 Efficiency is important to all clothing makers, but it has become increasingly essential in the intimate-apparel business, where a few giants have become dominant in the last five years, playing on their sheer size to achieve economies of scale and production efficiencies.
While Maidenform was apparently doing a fine job of staying ahead in fashion trends, the company ran into serious trouble getting its products from design room to factory to retail store in a timely manner, people with knowledge of the company said, and the production problems spiraled down to the balance sheet.
"Money is made and lost in keeping your manufacturing going," said Lee Chaden, the chief executive of Sara Lee's intimates division.
The Sara Lee Corporation is the biggest player in the $10 billion domestic intimate-apparel business, with about a 29 percent market share; the Warnaco Group and the VF Corporation have about 7 percent each. The privately held, New York-based Maidenform has 3.5 percent, on sales last year of about $400 million, and dozens of smaller players pick up the rest. Victoria's Secret, a unit of Intimate Brands Inc., says it has a 10 percent share, although several other companies make its apparel.
Over the last five years, these biggest players have become more aggressive with acquisitions here and in Europe, snatching up smaller brands and gaining efficiencies along the way. VF, for example, cited intimate apparel as one of the key growth areas that contributed to its strong second-quarter earnings, which the company announced this week. VF was recently in talks to acquire Maidenform, but the negotiations collapsed.
Each company has also tried to eke out as many new fashion trends as possible in an area of apparel that is least driven by fashion. The Wonderbra, a Sara Lee product that made cleavage fashionable again, invigorated both that company and the many competitors that copied the bra in 1994 and 1995.
And sales of so-called shapewear, a relatively new product that functions more or less as a newfangled girdle, grew 12.7 percent last year.
Designer licenses for underwear lines have also become a key point of competition. Maidenform sells apparel under the Oscar de la Renta name, Warnaco has the Calvin Klein license and Sara Lee recently acquired the rights to make Ralph Lauren intimates, which are hitting the stores now.
But most important is the manufacturing of bras. According to the NPD Group, a research firm, bras accounted for $3.6 billion, or more than a third, of the intimate-apparel industry last year. And unlike other apparel, which in their simplest form can be put together with a few seams and a zipper, bras are complicated to make and their production requires careful management.
"Bras are one of the most complex pieces of apparel," said Adelle Kirk, a manager at Kurt Salmon Associates, a management consulting firm that specializes in the apparel and retail businesses. "There are lots of different styles, and each style has a dozen different sizes, and within that there are a lot of colors.
"Further, there is a lot of product engineering. You've got hooks, you've got straps, there are usually two parts to every cup and each requires a heavy amount of sewing. It is very component intensive."
To manage this complex production, bra makers have to wring the most they can out of each component -- such as getting the same type of strap or color palette to work for five different bras -- and manage their factory orders carefully.
With so many pieces involved, coordination is especially important. Order inefficiently, and factories can lie dead for long periods, only to be overwhelmed at the last minute and unable to keep up with the workload. This results in not getting the products to the store in time. Several retailers have complained over the last year that while they liked Maidenform's lines, they had trouble getting the products in time to sell.
Maidenform had caught up with the shapewear trend -- its Subtract line had about 30 percent of the shapewear business. It had a strong designer name in the Oscar de la Renta line. And few could beat the brand -- Maidenform is a household name among those old enough to have sat through at least one humiliating department store bra fitting.
But Maidenform, which like other companies in its field looked for growth through acquisitions, did not carefully manage the integration of operations when it bought 92 percent of NCC Industries, another intimate-apparel company, in 1995.
"That acquisition diverted management's attention and they were not realizing the synergistic benefits, which included cost saving in the back office and in operations," said Ted Stenger, the new president of Maidenform.
Further, the company was making up for inefficiencies by overspending, had tapped out its bank loans and was not ready to make a $4.3 million payment on senior notes that were due in September. And NCC had a shortage of materials needed to make the apparel, which slowed production and stunted distribution, causing sales to decline. NCC lost $1.3 million in the first quarter and its sales declined 46 percent.
Maidenform will now consolidate several divisions to cut costs and get better synergies.
Analysts say that because of its strong product lines and fierce brand name, Maidenform may well emerge from Chapter 11 a viable player, but only if it turns its focus on its production issues. "In the old days," said Laurence Leeds, an analyst at Buckingham Research Group, "if you did fair, you had a nice business. But now if you do fair, you go home."

HEADLINE: Boeing Concession Averts Trade War With Europe

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, July 23

 BODY:
The Boeing Company may rule the skies as the world's dominant commercial aircraft manufacturer, but it humbly gave in to the demands of European antitrust regulators and won approval today of its $14 billion merger with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
Boeing's last-minute concessions on Tuesday narrowly averted a trade battle between the European Union and the United States. European regulators, displaying an increased appetite for brinkmanship, were prepared to reject a merger between two companies based on American soil despite the approval of the deal by United States authorities and support from the White House. 
 European officials have argued for months that the merger poses grave threats to competition, given that Boeing already controls more than 60 percent of the global market for commercial aircraft and that its only real rival is the European consortium Airbus Industrie.
In particular, they objected to exclusive contracts Boeing had signed with three United States airlines. Today, in its key concession toward winning approval from the European Union's executive arm, the European Commission, Boeing agreed not to enforce the exclusive-supplier provisions of those deals, though analysts said that would have little effect on Boeing's bottom line.
While a trade war was avoided, experts on both sides of the Atlantic said increasing economic globalization would make further disputes like this one inevitable. Despite growing international agreement on issues like tariffs and import restrictions, as more companies with global operations seek to merge, clashes between countries with different policies for promoting competition and regulating trade are bound to recur.
"A train wreck was avoided today, but we have many more trains coming down the track," said Michael Hodges, senior lecturer in international relations at the London School of Economics. "We need a new signaling system to keep them from colliding."
The agreement reached with Boeing marked a major display of power by Europe's Minister of Competition, Karel van Miert, and a clear sign that European leaders are willing to impose their will on global companies regardless of territorial boundaries.
But such clashes can and have been started just as easily by the United States. Indeed, the Federal Trade Commission successfully insisted on several concessions on patents before allowing the recent merger between two Swiss pharmaceutical giants, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, to proceed.
"This was not a one-shot, one-time deal," said Joel Klein, the Assistant Attorney General for antitrust issues at the Justice Department, who was involved in negotiations over the Boeing case. "As the world becomes more globalized, these are the kinds of problems we will be seeing."
Because Mr. van Miert got almost everything he had demanded, experts said his victory was likely to make the pugnacious and savvy antitrust chief even more formidable.
"American competitive authorities didn't entirely agree with us, but we have always insisted on our point of view," Mr. van Miert said triumphantly at a news conference here today. Boeing, he added, "must have realized that unless they made major concessions, the commission would act against them."
Although the European Commission had demanded and won concessions in one other deal between two American companies, the 1995 merger between the Kimberly-Clark Corporation and Scott Paper, never before had it threatened as loudly or as often to impose billions of dollars in fines on an American company if it did not get its way.
While the Europeans could not technically have blocked the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger, the fines could have made it difficult for Boeing to operate in Europe.
Boeing executives and a number of American politicians had accused Mr. van Miert of merely trying to protect Airbus, which is Boeing's main rival in commercial aircraft manufacturing. And many European politicians for several months have made plain their alarms that the new merger would put Boeing permanently in control of the world market.
Mr. van Miert always denied the accusation of protectionism, arguing that he had simply applied Europe's merger regulation guidelines and sought the remedies he felt were necessary to safeguard competition. Boeing currently sells more than 60 percent of the world's commercial aircraft, while Airbus sells about 30 percent and McDonnell Douglas sells less than 10 percent.
Analysts said Boeing's concessions would probably have little effect on the company's competitive position, at least in the near term. But Richard R. Albrecht, executive vice president of Boeing's commercial airplane group, acknowledged today that his company had blinked.
"We were faced with a very difficult decision," he said. "None of the alternatives that we faced seemed attractive."
Perhaps the least attractive option for everyone was a full-blown trade war. As recently as Tuesday morning, it looked as if both sides were at an impasse and a trade war was indeed possible. But as the European Commission's scheduled vote on the issue drew near, Boeing finally folded its cards and conceded to Mr. van Miert.
Investors appeared to be relieved that an agreement was reached as shares of Boeing rose 4.7 percent, to $59.0625, up $2.6875 on the day, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
As part of the agreement, Boeing also said it would license some patents on commercial aircraft to rivals. And it agreed to keep what remains of McDonnell Douglas's small commercial aircraft business a legally separate entity for a number of years, so as to prevent its being used to extend Boeing's control over the market.
But the big battle was over Boeing's long-term contracts to be the exclusive supplier of aircraft to American Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Continental Airlines. Mr. van Miert insisted that the exclusivity clauses be dropped and that Boeing agree not to strike similar deals in the future.
The Clinton Administration had tried to bridge the gap several weeks ago without success. Mr. Klein said the Government was primarily concerned about promoting the continued consolidation of the military industry, in which companies have been furiously merging as a way to survive in an era of reduced Pentagon budgets for weapons.
Even as the dispute was resolved, other trans-Atlantic mergers and alliances were being weighed. The Federal Trade Commission, for instance, is investigating the competitive effect of a proposed merger between two giant British consumer product companies, Guinness P.L.C. and Grand Metropolitan P.L.C.
And most experts predict big clashes over competition policy on telecommunications, an area in which European monopolies are being opened up and American companies are intensely eager to compete.
Moreover, American and European officials do not see eye to eye on how to deal with future conflicts like the Boeing case. Mr. van Miert noted today that the European Union had proposed that countries begin discussing ways to incorporate competition policy into the structure of the World Trade Organization, the Geneva-based agency that acts as an independent court to resolve trade disputes between countries.
But American officials have been against that idea, fearing, for instance, that it might endanger American rules against foreign companies exporting products to the United States at below their real cost, a practice known as "dumping."
"Competition policy has different meanings in different countries," said Jay Ziegler, a spokesman for the United States trade representative in Washington.
"The U.S. takes a consumer's eye on how the merger will affect consumers. Other countries look at how it affects other companies."

Boeing Gives In and Wins European Approval of Deal
Boeing gave in to European regulators' demands and won approval of its merger with McDonnell Douglas. At a news conference in Washington, the chief executives of the two companies -- Philip M. Condit of Boeing, left, and Harry Stonecipher of McDonnell Douglas -- discussed the agreement.
Though Boeing's capitulation put off the threat of a trade war, experts said increasing economic globalization would make similar disputes inevitable as other multinational companies seek to merge. [Page A1.] 

Though Boeing agreed to give up arrangements making it the exclusive supplier of aircraft to three airlines -- American, Continental and Delta -- the concession will have little practical effect for years, analysts said. [D5.]
 
Oil Earnings Unexpectedly Strong
Four large energy companies -- Mobil, Chevron, Shell and Conoco -- reported strong earnings, surpassing analyst expectations, as higher refining profits offset lower crude oil and natural gas prices. [D4.]
 
Mixed Results for Airlines
Trans World Airlines, the only leading American carrier that continues to lose money, posted a bigger-than-expected loss, $12 million. US Airways's earnings rose 2 percent, but that was less than expected. Continental's profit was down 23 percent but topped forecasts. [D6.]
 
Stock Market Again Sets Records
The stock market, continuing to bask in an economy that Alan Greenspan calls exceptional, scaled new heights. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.71 points to close at a record 8,088.36. With technology shares mostly stronger, the Nasdaq composite rose 3.79, to 1,567.65. [D8.]
 
Treasury prices fell slightly, with the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rising to 6.43 percent from 6.41. [D18.]
 
3M Profit Rise Is Disappointing
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, whose performance is often considered a benchmark for the economy because of the company's large and diverse product base, said earnings rose 9.7 percent, slightly less than expected. Its shares fell slightly on the news. [D5.]
 
Nomura Admits Payoffs to Gangster
The president of Nomura Securities acknowledged for the first time that the company had made payoffs to a racketeer, and he vowed to clean up the firm. [D8.]
 
Tarses Says She Will Stay at ABC
Jamie Tarses, the president of ABC Entertainment, said that she was staying at the network, flatly denying speculation that she was negotiating to get out of her contract or that ABC was attempting to force her out. [C16.]
 
Advantage, Union Pacific Resources
Though Pennzoil, which once courted Union Pacific Resources, is now fighting off a hostile bid from that company, Union Pacific Resources appears to be getting the upper hand in the struggle. Market Place. [D8.]
 
Swiss Bank Finds Old Accounts
Swiss Bank said that it had previously failed to report the existence of accounts worth more than $11 million that might include assets from Holocaust victims. [A10.]
 
Another Strike Against G.M.
Labor unrest continued at General Motors, as workers struck at a plant in Warren, Mich., that supplies parts for nearly all of the company's American-made vehicles. [D4.]
 
Lilly Results Match Estimates
Eli Lilly reported a net loss, reflecting a previously announced charge of $2.4 billion to write down its PCS Health Systems unit, but operating profit rose 21 percent. [D2.]

Milosevic Expands Powers As Serbia Deteriorates
Slobodan Milosevic switched jobs, becoming President of the Yugoslav federation, and stepping down as President of Serbia. He maneuvered to take the Yugoslav presidency, until now a figurehead job, because he was barred by the Constitution from serving again as President of Serbia. He promised "a peaceful, independent, just and developed country." But since the war that Mr. Milosevic presided over and that led to the breakup of Yugoslavia, the Serbian economy has declined sharply and has become largely criminalized. A3

Tuition for British Students
The British Government plans to impose tuition fees on all college students, effectively abandoning the country's long-held commitment to free higher education for everyone. In a nation where free education is considered a basic right, the announcement was taken as a further sign that Prime Minister Tony Blair's new Government was intent on dismantling many of the most sacred vestiges of Britain's old-style welfare state. A7
 
Irish Plan Opposed by Some
The main Protestant political parties voted to reject a proposal by the British and Irish Governments for disarming the Irish Republican Army and Protestant paramilitary groups. British and Irish officials, who expected the decision, said the setback would not kill peace negotiations, pointing out that the largest Protestant party has pledged to continue to work with the Government. A8
 
Swiss Bank Reports Mixup
As Swiss banks sought to restore credibility lost in their handling of dormant accounts thought to belong to Holocaust victims, one of the country's top banks acknowledged that it had failed to report the existence of accounts worth more than $11 million that may include Jewish assets. The admission, by the Swiss Bank Corporation in Basel, clouded an unparalleled move by the banks to publicize dormant accounts opened before the war ended. A10
 
Experts, Holocaust survivors and others studied the list of 2,000 long-dormant Swiss bank accounts made public this week and said they were angry that the banks had not done more to track down the depositors. A10
 
Weapon Cuts in Europe
The United States, Russia and 28 other nations agreed on the framework of a treaty to reduce the number of tanks and other non-nuclear weapons in Europe, especially in Central European countries of the former Warsaw Pact. The agreement would replace and expand a 1990 accord on conventional arms between NATO and nations that were then members of the Soviet bloc. A5

Clinton Aided Fund-Raising
President Clinton personally requested a list of potential contributors whom he offered to call to try to raise $1 million for the Democratic National Committee early last year, according to a White House memorandum recently turned over to Congressional investigators. Several weeks after Mr. Clinton had asked to call the donors, several people on the President's list gave $50,000 and $100,000 checks to the Democrats, according to Federal Election Commission records.

G.O.P Gets Budget Agreement
Republican leaders of the House and Senate agreed on a $16 billion plan to provide health care for uninsured children, the biggest investment in children's health since Medicaid was created in 1965.

Religious Groups Boycott City's Workfare Program
A coalition of 68 churches, synagogues and nonprofit groups in New York City is refusing to hire welfare recipients as part of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's workfare program, denouncing the program as unjust. Borrowing the language of abolitionism, the coalition, which includes the Judson Memorial Church and Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, hopes to use its moral stature to press the city to treat its 38,000 workfare employees with greater dignity and pay them far more than they now receive.

New York State is likely to insure that as many as 100,000 immigrants continue to receive food stamps, even after the Federal government stops paying for them next month, Gov. Pataki and legislative leaders said. B1

Liquor Product Draws Critics
A brewer of malt liquor has been testing a frozen version of the drink in five urban markets, including New York, since June. The drink is often sold in freezer cases next to traditional ice cream confections and critics of the alcoholic beverage industry seized on the new product as a blatant attempt to convert children and teen-agers into drinkers.

Anticipating that Metrocards will change the way commuters use buses and subways, transit officials said they would cut bus service on several major north-south routes in Manhattan, while adding service to crosstown lines and to routes running to the distant reaches of the other boroughs. The schedule changes start Aug. 31. B4

Europe Approves Boeing Deal
Boeing gave in to the demands of European antitrust regulators and won approval for its $14 billion merger with McDonnell-Douglas Corporation. Boeing's last-minute concessions narrowly averted an unprecedented trade battle between the European Union and the United States, in which European regulators were prepared to reject a merger between two companies based on American soil despite the approval of the deal by United States authorities and support from the White House.

Greenspan Mum on Market
Through his silence during Congressional hearings this week about the risks of a stock-price bubble, Alan Greenspan may have been admitting that the market was right after all, and that he, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was wrong last December when he attached the phrase "irrational exuberance" to investor psychology.

HEADLINE: Strike Closes Parts Factory In Job Dispute

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: WARREN, Mich., July 23

 BODY:
This has been the year of strikes at the General Motors Corporation, a series of contests pitting a union determined to keep the company from downsizing against a bloated auto maker struggling to get in shape as more and more customers buy from G.M.'s more efficient competitors.
The latest walkout came just before midnight on Tuesday here, where 2,510 workers build parts used on nearly all of the company's American-made cars and trucks. If the strike lasts more than a few days, it could shut down most of the company, resulting in tens of thousands of layoffs nationwide as other G.M. factories run out of the transmissions, wheels and other parts built here. 
 Indeed, late today General Motors notified 2,700 workers at the Flint factory, which builds Buick LeSabres and Pontiac Bonnevilles, not to report to work on Thursday.
Because of the magnitude of the impact, a settlement could come soon. People close to the negotiations said that considerable progress was made in talks today and that a deal might be reached quickly.
Members of the United Automobile Workers picketing outside the gates of the Warren Transmission Plant, a giant, red-brick factory in this suburb of Detroit, said they were determined to stay on strike until the company gave in to their demands for increased staffing.
The labor unrest here is the sixth strike this year at General Motors, and comes just five days after the end of a three-month strike at a pickup truck factory in nearby Pontiac. The company said that in the second quarter alone, strikes had cost it $490 million -- enough to build a new, state-of-the-art factory.
Reg McGhee, a spokesman for the union's national headquarters in Detroit, said the Warren strike was part of the union's effort to retain jobs.
"Manpower is a big issue there, as are health and safety," Mr. McGhee said. "It's much the same as in other negotiations by local unions."
Sean P. McAlinden, an economist at the University of Michigan, said today's strike reflected the auto maker's desire to reduce its labor force through attrition as new car and pickup truck designs require less and less labor.
"G.M. is still committed to their long-run restructuring of the corporation, which may eliminate anywhere from 50,000 to 75,000 hourly jobs," Mr. McAlinden said.
General Motors has about 220,000 hourly workers. At its peak in the early 1960's, it built three-fifths of all the automobiles sold in the United States. But its share of the market has been steadily shrinking, and last month it was down to a record low 29 percent, partly because of the strikes earlier this year.
The U.A.W. wants General Motors to hire 500 workers to fill union jobs lost to attrition as members retired from the factory here over the last several years.
"They haven't replaced a retiree in this plant in almost two years," said Bill H. Bagwell Jr., a committee member for the plant's union, Local 909. "We are hundreds of jobs short."
Other strikers said that the company was also trying to find a supplier to build the steel wheels now made by about 100 workers at the plant here, and that it planned to move other workers from a factory in Flint to Warren -- some with enough seniority to replace those here.
In addition, the union is negotiating with General Motors to fix various health and safety problems, and several strikers complained about a lack of respect for workers.
The company refused to comment on the causes of the strike.
Even if it reaches a deal here, it has more work ahead. The company is struggling to negotiate agreements with local unions at 10 more factories nearly nine months after it reached a broad agreement with the U.A.W.'s national leadership.

HEADLINE: CUNY Chancellor Followed Policy on Writing Test Requirement;
Help the Undereducated

 BODY:

To the Editor:
It is difficult to justify spending $1.1 billion a year to regain the imagined perfection of the past "when City College was viewed as the public Harvard" (news article, July 20). The City University of New York should stop competing for well-prepared students, since government aid programs insure that most bright students have access to a college education.
In contrast, there is every reason to support a public university that provides quality instruction to undereducated students and to immigrants of limited English proficiency. Many of these students will require more than a semester of remedial education. 
 At a time when the future of our economy is increasingly dependent on a college-educated work force, the failure of CUNY to articulate such a compelling mission makes it an easy target for continued budget cuts.

HEADLINE: British Students Facing a New Test: Tuition

BYLINE: By SARAH LYALL 

DATELINE: LONDON, July 23

 BODY:
The Government announced today that for the first time, Britain plans to impose tuition fees on all college students, effectively abandoning the country's long-held commitment to free higher education for everyone.
For Americans used to paying fees for state-run schools or tuition approaching $30,000 a year at Ivy League schools, the proposal -- to charge up to $1,600 a year -- may seem laughably modest. But the plan also means students would no longer be eligible for Government grants covering room and board, and many graduates will face debts of more than $16,000. 
 In a nation where free education is considered a basic right, the announcement was taken as a further sign that Prime Minister Tony Blair's new Government is intent on dismantling many most sacred vestiges of Britain's welfare state.
"Free tuition is seen as a right," said Liz Llewellyn, a spokeswoman for the National Union of Students, which says the prospect of leaving school deeply in debt will deter many young people from attending college at all. "We've always been told that if you choose to go on with your education, the state should pay because you'll give so much back to the state by getting a better job and paying more in taxes."
The Government's plan was outlined in a speech to the House of Commons this afternoon by David Blunkett, the Secretary for Education and Employment. He said Britain's universities, which face a deficit of up to $3.2 billion in the next decade, had fallen into a financial crisis that could be addressed only by imposing fees.
Tuition at British universities is free to citizens of Britain and other European Union countries; room and board is paid for by a combination of Government grants, student loans and parental help. Postgraduate and part-time students and students from countries outside the Union already pay tuition.
Under the Government's plan, all but the poorest students would be expected to pay tuition of up to $1,600 a year, as well as several thousand dollars for room and board. Student loans, to be paid back according to income and over a number of years, would be available for both tuition and living expenses.
Some students said today that the new charges would put an almost unbearable strain on their already shaky finances. Others said that while they would benefit from the more relaxed loan repayment schedule, they felt the Government had abdicated a basic responsibility.
"The issue is whether or not it's fair for students to pay fees," said Kat Myers, 21, a student at Loughborough University in Leicestershire, who does clerical work to help meet her living expenses. "The ethos of this country has always been that it should lie with the Government."
In most other European Union countries, university costs are paid for out of taxes and governments spend a comparatively higher percentage of gross domestic product on college-level education. But not even in Germany, for instance, where there has been considerable pressure to reduce social spending, has the Government proposed to levy university fees on students.
For a number of years, Britain's universities have been warning of an impending financial crisis. While the number of students has increased drastically -- in the early 1960's, one in 20 young people in Britain was enrolled in higher education; today the figure is one in three -- Government aid to universities per student has declined.
Some colleges at Oxford and Cambridge have their own endowments and have soldiered on with relatively few problems. But other institutions have had to scrimp and save.

HEADLINE: Stocks Keep Advancing; Dow Up 26.71

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

 BODY:
It's the kind of summer that investors have long dreamed about.
The economy is humming along. Federal Reserve policy makers are cheering it on. And the stock market is climbing to new heights. 
 Yesterday, a day after Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, told Congress that the economy was "exceptional," investors bid prices up even more.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.71 points, to a new high close of 8,088.36, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.58 points, to a record 936.56.
"Yesterday, Chairman Greenspan said some really nice things about the economy, and the Dow shot up 154 points," said Hildegard Zagorski, a market analyst at Prudential Securities. "It was a more subdued advance today, but this is still part of the ongoing bull market."
In fact, the Dow's gains have been spectacular. A year ago yesterday, the Dow stood at 5,346.55 -- its lowest point of summer 1996. Since then, the blue-chip average has soared 51.3 percent in one of the most powerful 12-month run-ups ever.
And in slightly less than seven months of this year, the Dow has nearly equaled its 26 percent climb for all of 1996. With the Dow up 25.4 percent this year, it is just 35 points shy of matching last year's advance.
Of course, the mantra heard repeatedly on Wall Street is that investors are being treated to a "just right" economy, a combination of steady growth, low inflation and rising earnings.
There is also talk about the continued strength of the dollar, a strong American economic position relative to Europe and Japan, and the undeniable power of euphoric investor sentiment.
"Clearly, sentiment is what's driving the market now, not earnings," said Gail Dudack, chief investment strategist at UBS Securities. "The trade-weighted dollar is near an eight-year high. And if the dollar's a safe haven, people want to buy more U.S. assets."
Falling interest rates in the bond market have also been a boon to stock prices. Yesterday, the benchmark 30-year Treasury rose two basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 6.43 percent. But since late May, the long bond has fallen sharply, down 60 basis points from 7.03 percent.
This economic brew has helped carry share prices out of a month-long slump that ended in mid-April and toward gains of nearly 27 percent.
Still, according to Jeffrey Applegate, the chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, this type of run-up was not at all unusual after a Fed tightening, which last occurred in late March.
"We've seen this movie five times before in the postwar period," he said. "It's the classic contraction-expansion scenario."
When the Fed tightens to slow economic growth, he said, as it did in 1962, 1966, 1984, 1987 and 1994, the market typically contracts. But in each instance Mr. Applegate cited, a year later -- after the economy retrenched -- stocks made double-digit percentage gains.
"The Fed is tightening because G.D.P. is too strong, and they want to slow it down," Mr. Applegate said. "And when the Fed achieves that goal, the bond market rallies, and stocks gain."
Yesterday, however, the gains came after a mixed bag of earnings reports, with DuPont beating expectations and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing failed to meet them.
Shares of DuPont rose 1 7/16, to 67 5/8; shares of 3M fell 1 13/16, to 98 1/2.
Technology shares were mostly stronger yesterday, with Compaq Computer rising 6 7/8, to 138 3/8; Gateway 2000 up 3, to 44 3/4, and Dell Computer advancing 4, to 164.
Travel Services, a travel agency based in Palm Beach, Fla., was a strong initial public offering, rising nearly 60 percent from its offering price to 22 1/4 on its first day of trading.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite rose 3.79 points, to 1,567.65. And on the Big Board, advancing issues outpaced decliners, 1,733 to 1,167; volume was heavy, at 620.6 million shares traded, in what has become an extremely active summer.
With investors continuing to pour money into mutual funds that track the indexes, such as the S.& P. 500, and portfolio managers trying to narrow their performance gap, the market has remained unusually active, analysts said.
"There was a time when people took a vacation," said William LeFevre, an analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. "But now the stakes are too high. People are either delegating, or they're not going away."

HEADLINE: Nonprofit and Religious Groups Vow to Fight Workfare Program

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Denouncing workfare as morally unjust, a coalition of 68 churches, synagogues and nonprofit groups is refusing to hire welfare recipients under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's program requiring people to work for their benefits.
Borrowing the language of abolitionism, the coalition said it wanted to use its moral stature to press New York City to treat its 38,000 workfare employees with greater dignity and to pay them far more than they now receive. 
 Beside a sign saying, "Rudy, We Will Not Be Your Slave Drivers," several clergy members and leaders of nonprofit groups said at a news conference yesterday that they would fight the program by refusing to take any workfare employees, at a time when the city hopes to place thousands of such workers with nonprofit agencies.
"This program fails miserably to meet the criteria of justice and fairness," said the Rev. Peter Laarman, the pastor at Judson Memorial Church in Greenwich Village. "We don't want to say five years from now, here was an evil system that grew up around us and we didn't resist it."
The members of the coalition include Judson Memorial Church, the Stephen Wise Free Synagogue, Congregation B'nai Jeshurun on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, the Convent Avenue Baptist Church in Harlem, the First Presbyterian Church in Brooklyn, the Legal Aid Society and St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery. [List, page B6.]
Mr. Giuliani defended the program yesterday as fair and effective in moving people from welfare to work, asserting that the city had cut its welfare rolls by 285,000, in part thanks to workfare.
Officials in some nonprofit groups that have used workfare employees say the workers enable them to stretch their tight budgets and provide services that they could not otherwise afford. Several officials also said their organizations gave workfare participants valuable training and supervision.
But religious leaders in the coalition likened the workfare program to slavery, saying it forces welfare recipients to work without pay and drives down other workers' wages. They also attacked workfare for forcing many recipients to quit college and having thousands of workfare employees do the work once done by higher-paid city workers.
The clergy members and leaders of nonprofit groups urged the city to pay workfare workers what they called a living wage, to provide them with job training and to insure them permanent jobs. The coalition is urging other groups not to participate in the program even as the Giuliani administration is looking to them to take more welfare recipients, as it expands its Work Experience Program from 38,000 people to an expected 100,000 in the next few years.
About 2,500 workfare participants now work for nonprofit organizations, with the rest working directly for the city, cleaning streets and parks and doing other jobs. City officials say it will be far easier to expand the program if it can place more workers in nonprofit agencies.
Gary Bretton-Granatoor, senior rabbi at the Stephen Wise Synagogue, said he viewed workfare as a moral issue and gave a sermon just before Memorial Day condemning the city's workfare program, which is by far the nation's largest.
"There's a section in Leviticus that says if somebody in your community comes under your authority and they need your help, you are not allowed to treat them as a slave," he said. "My problem with workfare is they're not getting paid for the work they're doing. They're asked to work because they're receiving benefits. They're not treated in a human way. They're not given adequate changing facilities. They're not given adequate bathroom facilities. There is no way to address their grievances. That to me is enslavement."
Mr. Laarman, who is coordinating the antiworkfare effort, said he hoped that the coalition's efforts would inspire the formation of similar groups elsewhere as the new Federal welfare law requires other cities to expand their workfare programs. The New York coalition, Mr. Laarman said, was inspired in part by a coalition of churches, synagogues, nonprofit groups and labor unions in Maryland, which persuaded that state to prohibit its communities from using workfare workers to displace government employees.
But Mr. Giuliani defended workfare at a news conference, saying: "The program is an excellent program, and it is the most realistic program you can have for a city that had over a million people on welfare."
Anthony Coles, the senior adviser to the Mayor who oversees workfare, says workfare is a transition program aimed at moving workers from welfare to work and should not be viewed as a regular job. City officials say workfare teaches welfare recipients the discipline of work and has helped make the city's streets and parks cleaner.
The city has been contacting private agencies to invite them to hire workfare participants, and leaders of the coalition said about a third of their organizations had already been approached by the city.
The Rev. Kevin Sullivan, chief operating officer of Catholic Charities for the Archdiocese of New York, said the archdiocese employed some workfare workers but nevertheless sympathized with the coalition's concerns. "We've taken a very clear position with regard to work and welfare," he said. "For us work is not a dirty word. However, we believe that to respect human dignity, work should have certain characteristics. It should be at decent wages. It should be at decent working conditions. It should not be a dead-end job. And such work should not displace current workers.
"In certain ways, the city's workfare program doesn't meet our conditions of good work, and it can hurt current workers."
Msgr. Howard Basler, director of social action at the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, also criticized some aspects of the workfare program, although he said the diocese has more than a dozen welfare recipients working as soup kitchen aides or in rectory jobs.
"We do everything we can to make sure the workers receive training and that it is not a dead-end job," said Monsignor Basler. But he noted that the diocese could not absorb many more workers, as the city is urging, if it wants to provide them with proper training.
The executive director of one neighborhood center in Manhattan, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said she used six workfare workers to help serve and cook food for the center's senior-citizens program. Although she said she was not enthusiastic about workfare, she said the center hired the workfare participants and offered permanent jobs to them when openings developed.
"We need the extra help," she said.
The coalition members said the workfare program often employed workers in unsafe conditions and frequently did not provide them with boots or gloves for winter work or dangerous jobs. Mr. Laarman of Judson Memorial Church also said the city's program was punitive to the poor and was dragging down the pay of low-wage workers in city government and in the private sector.
"Basically, it's unjust," said the Rev. Janice Glenn, associate minister of the Convent Avenue Baptist Church. "People are being used to do work, and they're not being compensated for it."
The city established its workfare program, which focuses on welfare recipients who are adults without young children, even before the new Federal welfare law required states and cities to set up such programs. The new law will force the city to expand the effort vastly by requiring it to put many welfare recipients with children to work as well.
The Giuliani administration began placing workfare participants in jobs at nonprofit agencies three years ago, but it has stepped up those efforts in recent months under Federal pressures to expand workfare. The 2,500 workfare participants now working for nonprofit groups work in soup kitchens, day-care centers, girls' clubs, home health care and neighborhood improvement organizations.

HEADLINE: Jittery on Thailand, Asia Currencies Dip

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, July 24

 BODY:
South Asian currencies were lower again today, on concern that amid problems at Thai banks they might become targets of new speculative attack.
"All the speculators see the baht being weak," Conny Chandra, an interbank dealer at PT Bank Tiara Asia, said, referring to the Thai currency, "and they expect the other currencies like the rupiah to be, too." 
 The baht fell for a second day, to a rate of 32.2 to the United States dollar from 31.6 on Wednesday. Thailand's banks and finance companies are faced with mounting bad loans as the country experiences its slowest economic growth in a decade.
Thai banks have started reporting their financial results for the first six months of the year, detailing how their earnings were affected by these bad loans.
Finance Minister Thanong Bidaya has said he will give details of a bailout package for financial institutions and on how to stimulate the economy in two weeks.
Thailand's problems weighed on other currencies. The Indonesian rupiah fell more than 1 percent, to a rate of 2,625 to the American dollar. Singapore's dollar fell seven-tenths of a percent, to 1.4787 to the American dollar, its lowest rate in almost three years. The Malaysian ringgit declined to as low as 2.6540 to the dollar, a drop of six-tenths of 1 percent.
Currency declines on Wednesday have prompted more businesses to buy the dollar for repayment of their dollar-denominated debts before the dollar becomes more expensive. This helped pull the Asian currencies lower today, traders said.

HEADLINE: In Tax Talks, Officials Play Game of Cat And Mouse

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration edged toward serious give-and-take with the Republican leadership today over how to cut taxes, with the outlines of a compromise apparent to both sides but neither willing to make the first big concession.
White House officials shuttled from meeting to meeting on Capitol Hill throughout the day and into the evening, sounding out the priorities of their fellow Democrats and providing Republicans with blunt assessments of what it would take to produce a tax bill that President Clinton would be willing to sign. 
 "We have started letting them know where we are willing to compromise, and vice versa," said Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader. "They're getting, I'm not going to say closer, but we have a better understanding on both sides."
Administration officials said the day's schedule amounted to no more than a "reconnoitering" mission.
"We discussed each issue, exchanged viewpoints, and that's about it," said Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff.
The effort to push the tax negotiations forward came as the Administration and Congressional leaders tried to resolve a separate dispute over the details of a bill covering reductions in Medicare spending, increased spending on children's health insurance and changes to welfare policy. Neither side reported significant progress, but each said it had emerged with a clearer understanding of the other's positions.
Republicans have been pushing hard to wrap up both the tax and spending bills in the next week and send them to President Clinton before Congress recesses on Aug. 1. But some Administration officials said they were in no particular rush to finish, a position also taken by some Senate Democrats.
The Administration and the Republicans are deeply divided over several important elements of the plan to cut taxes by $85 billion over five years. The Administration is demanding that Republicans scale back their proposed reduction in the capital gains tax, make more low-income working families eligible for a credit of $500 per child and increase tax breaks for college costs.
More generally, the Administration wants the tax plan modified to shift more benefits from the wealthy to lower and middle-income people and to limit the plan's long-term costs to head off a possible resurgence of big Federal budget deficits.
Privately, both Democrats and Republicans said they could foresee some of the likely tradeoffs. The Administration will have to grant the Republicans most if not all of the reduction they are seeking in the top rate on capital gains, from 28 percent to 20 percent, but the Republicans will have to give up their plan to allow investors to subtract the effects of inflation.
Mr. Clinton, they said, will probably win less than the $35 billion in college tax breaks he wants, but Republicans will probably have to make more lower-income families eligible for the child credit.
But there are many complex issues that remain in dispute. Although House and Senate Republicans have resolved most of their differences over how to apportion the tax cuts, they remain divided over the Senate's plan to raise the cigarette tax by 20 cents a pack and to use about half the proceeds to increase spending on children's health programs by $8 billion over five years.
House Republicans said today that they might soften their opposition to the tobacco tax, but said they would not want the proceeds to go to children's health or any other spending program. Democrats and some Senate Republicans said that removing the additional financing for children's health would seriously reduce the chances of any tax bill's winning Democratic support.
One consideration, members of both parties said, is moving the cigarette tax into the spending bill to link it more closely to the children's health issue and remove it as a point of contention in the tax bill.
Officials said the White House was unenthusiastic about the latest Republican proposal on the child credit, to allow low-income families whose income tax liability is eliminated by the earned income tax credit to "carry forward" the child credit into the future when they might have an income tax bill. The House bill would have made the child credit available only to families who have to pay Federal income taxes.
Republicans also appeared to be near a compromise among themselves on the details of a plan to extend the tax on airline tickets. Under heavy pressure from major airlines, Republicans said they are moving toward adopting a version of the tax close to that passed by the House rather than one passed by the Senate and opposed by the airlines. The plan would gradually reduce the current 10 percent tax to 7.5 percent and impose a $1 fee for each flight segment, rising eventually to $3.

HEADLINE: Khmer Rouge, With a 'Magic Trick,' May Have Made Themselves Disappear

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia, July 24

 BODY:
In the days leading up to the Cambodian coup earlier this month, Khmer Rouge guerrillas seemed to be provoking Hun Sen, the militarily powerful Second Prime Minister, by dallying with his political rival and by taunting him in radio broadcasts from their jungle stronghold.
Their machinations may have been just the impetus he needed. After months of infighting and growing tensions, Mr. Hun Sen turned his armed forces on those of his rival coalition partner, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, and seized sole power. 
 But whatever game the Khmer Rouge were playing, they appear in the end to have lost. The coup has left them weaker and more isolated than ever. Any chance they may have had of negotiating an amnesty seems to have faded, and any alliance they may form with Prince Ranariddh's defeated soldiers will pose little threat to Mr. Hun Sen's Government.
That much now seems clear. What is less clear is just what was going on in the Khmer Rouge headquarters in Anlong Veng, and why. Five weeks after the Prince began to offer a series of sensational accounts about turmoil in the Khmer Rouge leadership, none of his reports have been confirmed.
Mr. Hun Sen has described the entire episode as a "magic trick" masterminded by the evil genius of Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader. A number of foreign experts on the Khmer Rouge agree.
But there is no way to know whether Pol Pot himself was involved, or even whether he is still alive. The 69-year-old guerrilla has not been seen by foreigners since 1981.
The answers may never be known. This is a country where politics is played in the shadows, where illusion and disinformation are as much a part of politics as speeches and parliaments.
For the moment, Mr. Hun Sen holds the power in Cambodia. But his coup was only the most recent twist in a tangled history of alliances and rivalries that may not be laid to rest for years.
The latest chapter in the Cambodia drama began nearly a year ago when several Khmer Rouge commands broke with Pol Pot's hard-line leadership and defected to the Government. Both Mr. Hun Sen and Prince Ranariddh -- co-Prime Ministers with rival armies -- began lobbying vigorously for their allegiance.
In recent months, the stakes rose, with both sides reportedly sending representatives to talk with members of Pol Pot's inner circle at their northern headquarters in Anlong Veng.
In these negotiations, the Prince had an advantage over his rival: his royalist forces had been allies with the Khmer Rouge during a long civil war in the 1980's against the Vietnam-backed Communist Government of Mr. Hun Sen.
That Government had been installed in 1979 after a Vietnamese invasion put an end to the four-year rule of the Khmer Rouge during which more than a million people died. Mr. Hun Sen had himself been a Khmer Rouge cadre until he broke with Pol Pot in 1977 and fled to Vietnam.
In the three weeks leading up to the coup, the Prince increased the pressure on Mr. Hun Sen with a series of startling reports about events in Anlong Veng. He announced that the clandestine Khmer Rouge radio station was about to brodacast a pledge of allegiance to the Government.
The Prince's first report came on June 13, when he announced that Pol Pot had killed his longtime friend, the former Khmer Rouge Defense Minister, Son Sen, and run over his body with a truck. Political analysts here said they believed that Mr. Son Sen had been the figure with whom Mr. Hun Sen had been negotiating.
The Prince's reports continued: Pol Pot had fled into the jungle, sick and swinging in a hammock. Pol Pot had taken some of his supporters hostage, including another close aide, Khieu Samphan. Pol Pot had been captured by his own men and would soon be turned over for trial for crimes against humanity.
None of these reports were confirmed. Indeed, their only apparent corroboration came in Khmer Rouge radio broadcasts. These broadcasts were clearly aimed at provoking Mr. Hun Sen, whom they reviled as a puppet of Vietnam.
"It was a Khmer Rouge game through and through," said Christophe Peschoux, a scholar of Cambodian history, in describing the Prince's negotiations.
At first, Mr. Hun Sen was silent as the Prince's reports emerged. Then he began to complain that the Prince was transporting tough Khmer Rouge fighters into the capital in preparation for military action.
Then he attacked. On July 5, Mr. Hun Sen's troops began what one of his aides called a "mopping-up action," targeting the strongholds of the Prince's royalist troops on the outskirts of the city.
Lost in the din of the big guns that morning was the promised Khmer Rouge broadcast pledging allegiance to the Government -- too late to affect the course of events.
In a white paper issued three days later, Mr. Hun Sen's party said its armed attack came in response to what it called a "strategy of provocation" by the Prince. Among several actions, these were said to include both the negotiations with the Khmer Rouge and an infiltration of guerrillas into Phnom Penh.
"The military buildup and the alliance with the Khmer Rouge was virtually a declaration of war," the white paper said.
"The importance of the militarization of the Khmer Rouge and their introduction to Phnom Penh by Prince Ranariddh's military advisers cannot be minimized," it said. "For the first time since 1978, armed Khmer Rouge soldiers were present in the streets of Phnom Penh."
Western diplomats have similarly suggested that the Prince may have embarked on a tactic of provoking Mr. Hun Sen.
And Mr. Hun Sen had reason to be concerned about an emerging political alliance that could include the royalists, the Khmer Rouge and other smaller opposition groups -- a revival of the civil-war alliance of the 1980's.
But little evidence has emerged to support Mr. Hun Sen's claim that the Prince had brought Khmer Rouge fighters into the capital.
Indeed, Western experts who have analyzed the fighting on July 5 and 6 say there is stronger evidence to show that Mr. Hun Sen's forces included at least one unit of Khmer Rouge, commanded by Gen. Keo Pong, who defected with several hundred men in early 1996.
If the Khmer Rouge meant to provoke an open split between Prince Ranariddh and Mr. Hun Sen, it seems to have succeeded.
But if the guerrillas were hoping to be embraced in a new alliance, they may be out of step with history. It was the geopolitics of the cold war that provided the former alliance with its anti-Vietnamese and anti-Soviet support from the West and China as well as its sanctuary in Thailand.
The guerrillas' economic base -- an illegal gem trade -- disappeared last August with the large-scale defections of their Western commands.
And in Phnom Penh, the man in full control now is their enemy, Mr. Hun Sen. He is less likely than Prince Ranariddh to negotiate safe passage for the remaining hard-line leaders in Anlong Veng -- even if they were to hand over Pol Pot for trial.
"They are more marginalized than ever," said David Chandler, who has written widely about the movement. "They've got nobody to deal with in Phnom Penh. Their foreign patronage is all gone. They aren't going to get any deals from Hun Sen. He doesn't have to; they are no threat to him."

Chart: "Four Powerful Men, Four Decades of Battle"
The shifting alliances and enmities of the past few decades have become focused on the ambitions of four central figures: Second Prime Minister Hun Sen, who ousted his coalition partner, First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh, in a coup July 6; Prince Ranariddh's father, King Norodom Sihanouk, who remains in Beijing; and Pol Pot, the Khmer Rouge leader, whose shadow still darkens the nation. Here is a look back at the long intertwined paths of these four powerful men. SETH MYDANS
 
King Norodom Sihanouk, 74
After a decade in exile in China and North Korea, he accepted the titular role of constitutional King in 1993. During the recent coup he remained in Beijing.
 
Pol Pot, 69
Leader of the Khmer Rouge; possibly ailing or dead.
 
Hun Sen, 45
Supreme leader of Cambodia at the moment.
 
Prince Norodom Ranariddh, 53
The son of the King Sihanouk and formerly First Prime Minister of Cambodia, has fled the country searching for international support.
 
1953
Cambodia, under French control since 1863, gains its independence. A constitutional monarchy led by Norodom Sihanouk is established.
 
1965
Sihanouk breaks relations with the U.S., accusing it of antigovernment activity.
 
1969
The U.S. starts bombing North Vietnamese and Viet Cong in Cambodia.
 
1970
Cambodian Prime Minister Lon Nol, sup-ported by the U.S., over-throws Sihanouk while he is out of the country. Sihanouk allies with the Khmer Rouge in the resistance to Lon Nol.
 
1975
A radical Maoist group, Khmer Rouge, led by Pol Pot, seize power. Over the next four years, more than a million people are executed or die of starvation, disease or overwork.
 
1979
Vietnam invades Cambodia, overthrows Pol Pot and installs a puppet Government. A coalition of the Khmer Rouge, royalist and democratic forces launches a decade-long civil war.
 
1985
The Communist Party's Hun Sen becomes Prime Minister of the Vietnam-backed Government.
 
1991
The U.N. brokers a peace plan, the Paris Agreement, that calls for disarmament of all parties. Democratic elections are set for 1993, over Hun Sen's protests.
 
1993
Prince Norodom Ranariddh wins an election, boycotted by the Khmer Rouge and contested by Hun Sen. Prince Ranariddh is forced to share power with Hun Sen until the 1998 elections.
 
1996
Friction continues to build between the Prime Ministers and both amass troops and arms.
 
1997
With the Khmer Rouge frac-tured, Pol Pot is reportedly captured by his own men, but no evidence of this emerges. In an armed coup, Hun Sen ousts Prince Ranariddh, who is in France.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Dollar Rises Higher Yet; Even Swiss Franc Is No Haven

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the mark for a fourth straight day yesterday, on fresh hints that Germany would not oppose the rally and on unexpectedly weak Japanese economic news.
Demand for dollars also broadened to lower the Swiss franc, which had been less vulnerable to the dollar's latest ascent because of its perceived status as a safe haven from the uncertainties created by Europe's single-currency plans. The dollar touched a three-and-a-half-year high against the Swiss franc. 
 Stephen Jury, managing director for foreign exchange at the Union Bank of Switzerland, said that traders sold the Swiss currency "very aggressively."
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.8387 German marks, the strongest since July 1991, before settling in New York yesterday at 1.8348 marks, up from 1.8268 late Wednesday. The dollar has gained nearly 20 percent against the mark this year. It rose to 1.5065 Swiss francs, up from 1.4861 on Wednesday; that was the highest since December 1993.
The dollar also rose against the Japanese yen, strengthening to 116.05 yen, from 115.65 on Wednesday. It gained, as well, on the British pound, which declined to $1.6745, from $1.6804 late Wednesday.
The dollar has been rallying against the mark since Monday, rising along with stocks as reports continued to show a healthy American economy, German economic weakness and a growing conviction that the European single currency would most likely be weak.
The catalyst for further dollar buying yesterday was a decision by the German central bank to leave interest rates unchanged. In addition, the Bundesbank did not hold a news conference after the meeting; in the past, such occasions have been used to express views on currency rates and interest-rate trends.
"This was seen as a sign they're not even going to try jawboning the dollar," said John McCarthy, senior vice president for foreign exchange at ING Capital Markets Inc. in New York. "That started another wave of dollar-buying against the mark."
The dollar rose against the yen after a Bank of Japan quarterly report suggested that recovery from a prolonged slump, though it was proceeding, was "unlikely to gather significant momentum."

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims at Lowest Level in Year

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 24

 BODY:
The number of Americans claiming first-time jobless benefits dropped last week to the lowest level in nearly a year, the Government reported today in the latest sign of a strong jobs market.
Weekly jobless claims fell to 299,000 in the week that ended last Saturday from a revised 341,000 the week before. That was far below the 333,000 level that economists had forecast. Much of the decrease may have been attributable to the reopening of auto plants after their annual new-model retooling and the end of auto strikes. 
 The drop pushed weekly claims to their lowest level since the week that ended on July 27, 1996, when they were 297,000.
The four-week moving average, which helps to smooth out week-to-week swings in the data, also fell. The average of claims stood at 340,750 last week, down from 349,000 the week before.
The number of people continuing to claim benefits rose slightly, to 2,302,000, in the week ended July 12, the latest week for which the data were available.

Network Speeds Tempo of Downloading Songs

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
In a bid to demonstrate that a cable connection can expand the use of the Internet beyond exchanging E-mail and browsing the World Wide Web, At Home Network is expected to announce a service today that will enable subscribers to download the highest-quality audio recordings within minutes.
It is the first significant move by the company, which provides Internet access on a high-speed, high-capacity cable network, since an initial public offering two weeks ago. Yesterday, its shares closed down 62.5 cents, at $20, almost double the $10.50 initial offering price. 
 Downloading high-quality audio recordings can take more than an hour over normal telephone-line connections, but it takes less than five minutes with At Home's service. However, the move toward improved audio access is raising concerns within the recording industry about increased piracy and the potential for more disputes over intellectual property rights.
One of At Home's partners in the venture is N2K Inc., a company that operates Music Boulevard, a popular Web site. As part of the agreement, N2K will provide its library of 250,000 music albums for sale to At Home subscribers, but not for downloading. For 99 cents, users will be able to download music singles, each of which takes up about 6 megabytes of computer disk space.
"The speed is the huge difference," said Larry Rosen, chairman and chief executive officer of N2K in New York. "The appetite has always been there, but you really had to be patient."
Another key difference will be the quality of sound. Now, the faster recordings are downloaded, the poorer the quality. At Home's service provides high speed and high quality.
At Home's other partners include Net Radio Network and the DJ Network, which will provide broadcasts. Both provide broadcasts on the Internet, but the quality is low. At Home Network customers will hear broadcasts with the quality of compact disk recordings.
"The quality is so poor that it's really not a good experience," Charles Moldow, vice president of media development for At Home, said of current attempts to broadcast recordings over the Internet. But with cable connections, he said, "the audio is clear."
Analysts generally applauded At Home's move.
"They have created a compelling list of stuff to do," said Emily Green, an analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
For all its promise, however, the improved audio is not certain to prove profitable for At Home, which is owned by Tele-Communications Inc. and uses the networks of TCI, Comcast and Cox Enterprises.
"I don't think it will add significant equity to the company," said Michael W. Harris, president of Kinetic Strategies Inc., a company that monitors the Internet cable industry. "But it proves that they are the real deal, that all of this is not just talk."
At Home, based in Redwood City, Calif., has only 12,000 subscribers, but its potential market is much larger. At least 2.3 million homes now have cable Internet access, according to Kinetic.
Regardless of At Home's size, its service is raising concerns that piracy could become more rampant.
Mr. Rosen, N2K's top executive, has already heard from experts on the piracy issue.
"I've certainly talked to people who are concerned," he said. "There is no question that intellectual property rights become a major question in this new environment."
Hillary Rosen, president of the Recording Industry Association of America, who is unrelated to Larry Rosen, said: "I think it's scary. But we can't stop technology."
N2K, however, says its technology can help keep piracy of music singles to a minimum. It says users of the service can buy a song and play it on their computers. But unlike standard music files, the copies cannot be duplicated, and an internal encryption mechanism prevents them from being played on other computers.
"It's not like you can start a factory and crank out CD's," Larry Rosen said. "It's just not possible."

HEADLINE: AUTOS ON FRIDAY/Technology;
Toyota Ahead of Pack On Hybrid Production

BYLINE: By MICHELLE KREBS 

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
While many auto makers are working on electric vehicles and on hybrids that can run on multiple energy sources, the Toyota Motor Corporation seems most likely to become the first manufacturer to mass-produce a hybrid that delivers twice the fuel economy and one-tenth the emissions of a conventional automobile.
Toyota is planning to introduce its hybrid, a car sized between a compact Corolla and mid-size Camry, by the end of this year in Japan. 
 While purely electric cars are desirable because they produce no emissions, hybrids are appealing because they also have a gasoline engine that eliminates an electric vehicle's two chief drawbacks: a limited travel range and lengthy recharging periods. But with two power sources and high development costs, a hybrid car may ultimately cost more to buy.
Toyota's hybrid is equipped with a new, highly efficient 1.5-liter gasoline engine -- Toyota engineers say it should get 66 miles to the gallon -- and an electric motor with a high-voltage nickel-metal-hydride battery. The hybrid operates as an electric car under some conditions and uses the gasoline engine at other times to drive the wheels while also charging the battery. The idea is that the most efficient power source is always in use.
The yet-unnamed Toyota starts like an electric car and, in fact, the electric motor gets the car moving. Taking off from a stoplight, moving along at low speeds or descending a hill, the Toyota hybrid operates as an electric car. These are just the conditions that cause gasoline engines to emit relatively high levels of pollutants. As the hybrid picks up speed, the gasoline engine comes on. When decelerating before a stop, the gas engine switches off and the electric motor takes over again.
In a test drive of the hybrid, the switching back and forth between the electric motor and the gasoline engine was smooth and virtually imperceptible. Toyota engineers are working to make the switching even more transparent than it was in the prototypes recently demonstrated.
The Toyota hybrid does not require recharging, since the gasoline engine charges the battery while the car is running. Additional electricity is stored in the battery.
Toyota plans to sell at least 1,000 hybrids a year in Japan. It has no immediate plans for sales elsewhere, including the United States, although the car would meet California's strict emissions requirements.
The hybrid is part of Toyota's publicly stated strategy to establish itself as the producer of the world's safest and most environmentally friendly cars. That is a goal shared, no doubt, by other auto makers that are also developing low-emission, high-mileage vehicles with advanced safety features. Still, in an uncharacteristic move at the normally secretive company, Toyota has been showing its future technology to the press.
In addition to the hybrid, Toyota will introduce an electric RAV4 sport utility vehicle this fall in the United States and Japan. It has a range of 130 miles, made possible by nickel-metal-hydride batteries, the promising next generation of battery technology. Toyota will become the first to use these batteries, rather than the more conventional lead-acid batteries, in a production vehicle.
The battery packs are situated under the floor so that good stability and a roomy passenger cabin are maintained. The electric RAV4 is also equipped with a regenerative braking system that recaptures energy typically lost in braking. The electric RAV4 can be recharged using household current, with no need for charging stations like those required for the General Motors EV1, which is available for leasing in California and Arizona.
Toyota is also introducing what it calls its D-4 direct-injection gasoline engine. The engine operates on precise, ever-changing mixtures of fuel and air to decrease emissions and improve fuel economy.
And it has under development a fuel-cell electric car that uses an electro-chemical reaction of hydrogen, carried on board, and oxygen from the atmosphere to generate electricity that drives the motor. While other auto makers are developing no-emissions cars that use fuel cells, Toyota's uses a hydrogen-absorbing alloy in its system that makes the fuel cell more compact and better-performing.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices End Unchanged

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
Treasury prices ended unchanged yesterday, as several large corporate issues and a dearth of economic data curbed buying.
Still, traders and analysts said they continued to be bullish on the market following this week's upbeat assessment of the economy from Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman. 
 "The bond market is going to be fine in the near term," said Anthony Karadakis, senior financial economist at First National Bank of Chicago. "I don't see anything on the radar screen to shatter" the market's economic outlook, he said.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond was unchanged at 102 17/32 , leaving its yield at 6.43 percent.
Several large corporate bond issues held Treasury prices in check, analysts said, as investors sold Treasury securities to buy the higher yielding debt.
The most notable issue yesterday was $2 billion in Yankee bonds priced by Hutchison Whampoa Finance Ltd. of Hong Kong.
The multi-part offering was Hutchison's debut in the corporate bond market and met with very strong demand from institutional investors from around the world. It was a Rule 144A offering, which meant it was placed privately with institutional investors.
It was the largest global issue of Yankee bonds -- dollar-denominated debt issued by a foreign corporation or government -- ever by a corporation, said Carlos Cordeiro, managing director at Goldman, Sachs & Company, one of the lead underwriters of the deal.
"The enthusiasm this issue met in the market really speaks to the credit and the future of Hong Kong in so much as we are just barely 30 days into the new administration," he said.
Hutchison Whampoa Finance is a unit of Hutchison Whampoa Ltd., one of Hong Kong's largest conglomerates. The parent company owns a majority stake in Hong Kong International Terminals, the world's largest privately owned container terminal operator and the largest port operator in Hong Kong.
The largest of the issue's three offerings was $750 million of 10-year bonds. The other parts consisted of $500 million in 20-year bonds, $500 million in 30-year bonds and $250 million in 40-year bonds, which can be sold back to the issuer in 12 years.
The issue was rated A3 by Moody's Investors Service and A-plus by Standard & Poor's.
Analysts have said the issue, because of its large size and structure, is likely to be used as a benchmark for future Asian offerings.
In the Treasury market, meanwhile, investors will next turn their attention to today's report on durable goods orders in June.
But that figure -- notoriously volatile -- was not expected to have much market impact. More attention will be focused on Tuesday's report on the Employment Cost Index for the second quarter of the year.
The market will also have to contend with the issue of supply next week, when the Treasury is expected to announce the size of its planned sales of new 10-year notes and 30-year bonds in August.

HEADLINE: Dow at High Again, With 8,116.93 Close

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Stock prices rose to records again yesterday, rebounding from early losses as better-than-expected earnings from companies like Digital Equipment offset concern that prices had risen too far.
"The numbers that have been coming out have been as expected or better," said Don Fredell, senior managing trader at American Express Financial Advisors, which oversees $160 billion. Among the companies that like Digital rose on favorable earnings reports were Quaker Oats, Ericsson and Airtouch Communications. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which was down nearly 100 points at one point, rose 28.57, to a record 8,116.93. The benchmark 30-stock average rose for a fourth straight day, and closed above 8,100 for the first time.
Portfolio managers who failed to keep up with the broad market this year jumped in to buy when prices fell, traders said. The early declines were attributed to concern that the recent rally had pushed prices higher than justified, even with an economic and business backdrop that should result in growing profits.
"You're still seeing a lot of people chasing the recent strength in the market," said Franklin Morton, director of research at Ariel Capital Management, which oversees $1.7 billion. "It's been expensive in most of these last 15 years to be on the sidelines."
Stocks were buffeted by program trading throughout the day. Seven buy programs and three sell programs hit the market, according to Birinyi Associates Inc., a market research firm in Greenwich, Conn.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 3.74, to a record 940.30, and the Nasdaq composite index gained 1.48, to 1,569.13, about 11 points shy of its record from July 16.
Shares have rallied this week as the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, in testimony before Congress on Tuesday and Wednesday, said that the economy was performing exceptionally well without much inflation, suggesting that the central bank would not need to raise interest rates soon.
Digital Equipment rose 2 13/16 yesterday, to a 52-week high of 42 9/16 , after the computer maker said its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings more than doubled, beating estimates. The company also said it might buy back as many as 15 million shares, or 10 percent of its outstanding stock.
International Business Machines rose 2 11/16 , to 107 13/16 , and Dell Computer gained 6, to 170.
American depository receipts of Ericsson, the world's third-largest telecommunications equipment maker, rose 4 9/16 , to 46 5/16 , helping push the Nasdaq higher, after the company said second-quarter net income rose more than expected. Nokia A.B., the Finnish cell phone company, rose 3 13/16 , to 82 5/16 .
Airtouch Communications rose 3, to 31 1/2, after the cellular telephone service company said profit almost doubled, beating estimates.
A decline in Microsoft hurt the Nasdaq for much of the session. Microsoft fell 4 7/16 , to 138, on concern that 1998 fiscal year earnings might not rise as much as expected because the software company planned to significantly increase spending on sales and marketing.
Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing fell 2 7/8, to 95 5/8, dropping for a second day after reporting that the strong dollar and new product costs resulted in lower-than-expected earnings.
Quaker Oats rose 2, to 47 1/8, after the company reported better-than-expected earnings. Sales of inexpensive bagged cereals almost doubled.
Nellcor Puritan Bennett soared 7 5/32 , to 28 3/32 , after the medical products maker agreed to be acquired by Mallinckrodt for $1.9 billion in cash, or $28.50 a share. The price is a 36 percent premium to Wednesday's closing price for Nellcor shares. Mallinckrodt fell 1 1/2, to 38 1/4.

HEADLINE: Stadiums Aren't Saviors

 BODY:

To the Editor:
An alarming urban trend goes unchallenged in your July 23 news article about life in Detroit 30 years after its riots. If city planners are looking to new football and baseball stadiums as a solution to decades of social ills, they had better think again. Virtually no independent study has proved a link between new sports complexes and indicators of urban health like rates of unemployment, poverty and crime. 
 Such investments are more likely to drain public coffers than provide long-lasting and tangible improvements in a population's quality of life. And yet in Detroit, plans call for two costly structures -- despite the existence of Tiger Stadium, one of the country's oldest and most cherished baseball landmarks.

HEADLINE: In Ulster Drama, a U.S. Player Is Hopeful About Peace

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY 

DATELINE: BELFAST, Northern Ireland, July 24

 BODY:
Three days after the new I.R.A. cease-fire took effect, George J. Mitchell, the chairman of the Northern Ireland peace talks, sat in the unpretentious ground-floor restaurant of the Europa Hotel and assessed his three years of work toward ending sectarian warfare in this British province.
For one thing, the menu of the Europa, which claims to be the most-often-bombed hotel in Europe, no longer offers the B.L.A.S.T. sandwich, of bacon, lettuce and sliced tomato, a kind of cholesterol bomb that attacks from within. Mr. Mitchell, 63, the former Senate majority leader, opted for cottage cheese. 
 For another thing, Mr. Mitchell said, the peace effort just staggered through another obstacle on Wednesday afternoon.
A proposal by the Irish and British Governments to deal with the crucial issue of disarmament of the Irish Republican Army and Protestant paramilitary groups had been rejected because of the opposition by the three main Protestant Unionist parties. But the largest of these, the Ulster Unionist Party of David Trimble, said it would work for a compromise on the issue with the British Government when the peace talks resume on Sept. 15.
All political leaders in the North, Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, the I.R.A. political wing; Mr. Trimble, and even the Rev. Ian Paisley, the hard-line leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, agree with Mr. Mitchell that the process will continue in one form or another in September and that, if the cease-fire holds, Sinn Fein will be in the negotiations. That, Mr. Mitchell maintains, is encouraging, and not woolly-headed optimism.
As he spoke, officials and politicians were already saying that a new structure -- keeping the parties separate but having intermediaries shuttling between them -- could be a way out of the disarmament nettle.
"There's a lot of comment, including a good bit of hyperbole," about the rejection of the plan for discussing disarmament in the September talks, Mr. Mitchell said in the interview on Wednesday night. "But if you measure the process over a longer perspective, you can see that it's moving in the right direction."
He said that, during the first I.R.A. cease-fire, from September 1994 to February 1996, there were no peace talks. "Indeed, it was the absence of such talks that they cited as a reason for breaking the cease-fire," he said. "Now you have both a cease-fire and talks occurring and the largest Unionist party saying it's committed to peace talks, even though it didn't agree with the Governments' proposal on decommissioning," as disarmament is called here.
The Unionists wanted the I.R.A. to start to disarm once the talks reconvened. The proposal they rejected on Wednesday said only that disarmament would be discussed during the talks, with no guarantee that actual disarmament would occur.
In explaining the progress and stumbling blocks on the way to peace, Mr. Mitchell said: "There's a pattern to this process you can observe if you look back over the past three years. Each step forward is usually followed by a step backward. There's excessive optimism for the steps forward and excessive pessimism for the steps backward. The important thing is to ask whether the long-term trend is in the right direction. I believe it is."
Mr. Mitchell, a Democrat from Maine, pointed out that the events of the last few days were unusual in the course of the struggle for peace in Northern Ireland. "This week is the first time in modern history that both a cease-fire, observed by both sides, and a negotiating process are in existence at the same time," he said. "So, I'm hopeful."
Mr. Adams shares such hope. He has again demonstrated that he has strong influence with the I.R.A., by persuading the military commanders to try politics again instead of violence and to trust the new British Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to get real peace negotiations going.
But Mr. Adams has had to fend off a spate of criticism from radical Republican splinter groups that say he has abandoned the ultimate goal of a united Ireland, with the predominantly Protestant North absorbed by the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic to the south.
Virtually no one in Northern Ireland thinks that the talks will produce a united Ireland. British and Irish policy states that there will be no change in the political status of the North without the consent of the majority, which is 57 percent Protestant.
During the last two years, before the latest cease-fire, Mr. Adams rarely mentioned a united Ireland, using circumlocution to express his views on the issue, as he did in an article he wrote two weeks ago for The Irish Times. In it he urged the Irish Government "to uphold the legitimacy of Irish unity as a policy objective."
To a charge from a Republican radical that he would in effect be approving the partition of Ireland and the union of the North with Britain in any settlement produced by the talks, Mr. Adams said in an interview, "We are going to renegotiate the union; that is a different thing entirely." The renegotiation, he said, would include enhanced civil rights for Catholics and an end to job discrimination in the province, where the percentage of unemployed Catholics is twice that of Protestants.
And he is talking publicly again about a united Ireland as a subject Sinn Fein will raise in the talks.
At the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Paisley has pronounced the peace talks dead, but in the same breath stated that he would be willing to take part in restructured talks, possibly of the shuttle-diplomacy variety.
And John Hume, the Catholic leader of the mainstream Social Democratic and Labor Party, who with Mr. Adams was author of the current peace effort, said as he has hundreds of times, "Now is the time to stop shedding our blood and start shedding our sweat."

HEADLINE: Lake Tahoe's Legendary Clarity Is Threatened

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev., July 23

 BODY:
No less a cynic than Mark Twain proclaimed it "the fairest picture the whole earth affords." But these days, the crystal blue waters of Lake Tahoe are considerably less fair -- and are losing their world-famous clarity at a rate of nearly a foot and a half a year.
Twenty million visitors a year pour into the Tahoe basin, lured by the snow-capped granite crags of the Sierras that ring it and provide first-class skiing and hiking, by the gambling resorts that dot the Nevada shoreline, and by a lake so clear it looks like a 39-trillion-gallon swimming pool. They bring boats, Jet Skis and, above all, automobiles, whose exhaust contains nitrogen that winds up in the lake, fueling the growth of algae that in a generation or so could leave Tahoe a cloudy green muddle in the mountains. 
 "If we look 20 or 30 years out, we've got a really ordinary lake, unless we do something here soon," said Charles Goldman, a professor of environmental studies at the University of California at Davis who since 1959 has studied every aspect of the lake's ecosystem as director of the university's Tahoe Research Group. "Since I began studying it, the lake has changed dramatically from a classic limited nitrogen lake to one that has accumulated so much nitrogen that it is no longer a pure Western lake -- it is more like a Midwestern one."
Professor Goldman will have the chance to make that case this Friday and Saturday to President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, who are set to tour the lake in the university's research boat as part of a two-day "Tahoe summit" featuring a half-dozen Cabinet officials and the Governors and Senators of California and Nevada.
The Administration hopes to highlight Tahoe as a "shining example" that economic development and environmental protection not only can co-exist, but must, said Katie McGinty, director of the White House office on environmental quality.
And while Ms. McGinty would not elaborate, she said the President's commitment would include new money for "bread and butter" needs like sewage treatment and repairs to flood-damaged roads, along with stepped-up cooperation among the various Federal agencies that together own and control 78 percent of the land in the greater Tahoe basin, most of it national forests.
Already, local business, political and environmental leaders realize, that "everything that happens in the Tahoe basin winds up in the lake," said Senator Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada. That includes soil eroded by the construction of multimillion-dollar houses in this wealthy town along the Nevada shore, fertilizer from gardens and golf courses, gas and oil from Jet Skis, which dump a gallon of raw fuel into the water for every five they burn.
Altogether, Professor Goldman said, those factors are increasing the growth of algae by more than 5 percent a year, reducing visibility to around 70 feet today from about 100 feet in the early 60's. If corrective action is not taken within the next decade, he said, Tahoe will become a lake of ordinary clarity, with visibility only to about 40 feet.
Local officials say there is growing consensus that if that happens, the $1 billion annual tourist economy that depends on the pristine setting cannot continue to prosper.
"Ten or 15 years ago, there were tremendous clashes between the business interests here and the environmentalists," said Rochelle Nason, executive director of the League to Save Lake Tahoe, a 40-year-old nonprofit group "Today we're seeing a lot of common ground because local businesses realize the environment is their bread and butter."
Last month, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, the bi-state board established by Congress and the two states a quarter century ago to oversee development around the lake, voted to ban Jet Skis and other "personal watercraft" starting in 1999. That stand is far tougher than the Environmental Protection Agency and is one expected to be appealed by manufacturers and rental shops.
The agency has also compiled a "to do" list of reclamation projects totaling nearly $1 billion over the next decade or so that would require a mix of state, Federal, local and private money.
There are many proposals, some expensive, like rerouting the Upper Truckee River, the main stream that flows into the lake at its south end, to try to recreate the filtering effects of a marsh destroyed to build a housing development in the late 60's. Others are bound to be controversial, like erecting gates at the roads that ring the basin and then charging an entrance fee for cars.
For the moment, Cinda Pierce, who has lived in Incline Village since 1976, and seen its population triple from 9,000 and her property values increase more than sixfold, said the problems were all too obvious.
"I was out kayaking last week, and to see the algae and stuff attached to the rocks," Ms. Pierce said, her voice trailing off. "It just never used to be there."

Good Forecast for Economy

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN 

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK

 BODY:
New Jersey's economy is booming, forecasters said yesterday. By the end of the year, employment in nonagricultural industries is expected to rise by 1.8 percent, creating 65,000 new jobs, according to a report released yesterday by Rutgers University. 
 Personal income is expected to jump by 5 percent, while consumer prices are expected to increase 3 percent, said Nancy Mantell, director of the Rutgers Economic Advisory Service, which issues reports on the state's economy. She attributed the good news to low inflation, low interest rates, strong corporate profits and strong consumer confidence.

Rangers Add to Big Offers In the Race to Land Messier

BYLINE: By JASON DIAMOS

 BODY:
Negotiating his way brilliantly through a high-stakes poker game with his future as the pot, the Rangers' captain, Mark Messier, seems to have all the cards on his side right now. All the 36-year-old unrestricted free agent appears to be doing is playing out his hand.
At the table: the Vancouver Canucks with a three-year, $18 million offer; the defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings and their three-year, $15 million bid; and the Rangers, who are now believed to have raised their ante to two years, $10 million, with a club option or buyout for a third year that could increase the package's value to $15 million, too. 
 The Islanders announced yesterday that they have folded from the game. The Montreal Canadiens apparently never really were in. And contrary to popular belief, the Edmonton Oilers, Messier's former team, never tendered an offer.
"Of course I'm interested," said the Oilers' president, Glen Sather, a longtime friend of Messier's. "Can I afford him? No." The Rangers, the Red Wings and the Canucks apparently can.
The play is now Messier's. But he and his father, Doug, who serves as his agent, might make the Rangers' president, Neil Smith, and the folks at Madison Square Garden sweat a little more before they make their next move.
"I spoke to Doug Messier this morning because I wanted to know if those figures were somewhat accurate," General Manager Mike Milbury of the Islanders said yesterday of the various reported offers. "He said they were."
And so Milbury bowed out.
Neither Smith, Mark Messier nor the Garden's president, Dave Checketts, was commenting publicly yesterday, one day after the Rangers significantly increased their initial offer of one year for $5 million to Messier, with less than $4 million up front. The Rangers blinked because of the Canucks' enticing bid, which became public knowledge earlier this week.
"I don't know anything and I don't want to know anything," Rangers Coach Colin Campbell said yesterday from his summer home in Ontario, adding that he last spoke with Messier at Mike Richter's wedding earlier this month. "Certainly I would like to have Mark back and Neil as general manager would love to have him come back, too. But I have respect for both sides."
Campbell is not the only coach who would love to have Messier, however.
"As a coach, I'd take him as a player," Detroit's Scotty Bowman said yesterday, mindful that the presence of the veteran center, who has six Stanley Cup rings, might make it easier for the Red Wings to win another title this season. "But I'm not involved with the economics."
That responsibility belongs to Ken Holland, who became the Detroit general manager effective last Friday. It is believed that the Red Wings will not go four years and will not match Vancouver's offer.
SLAP SHOTS
The Rangers announced yesterday that their preseason schedule will begin on Sept. 14 in Montreal. Tickets for the three preseason games at Madison Square Garden will go on sale on Aug. 13. The Rangers will open training camp on Sept. 9 in Burlington, Vt.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Asian Central Banks Seek Ways to Block Speculators

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: SHANGHAI, July 25

 BODY:
Asian central bankers, reeling from speculative attacks in the foreign-exchange market, agreed today to study ways to increase the value of their countries' currencies but stopped short of promising to intervene in the market to support the currencies.
Moreover, currency traders and economists said the heads of the 11 central banks, who held a regularly scheduled gathering of the Executives' Meeting of East Asian and Pacific Central Banks, were fighting the wrong battle because it was slowing economic growth that had eroded their countries' competitiveness in world markets and left their currencies overvalued against the dollar. 
 Traders have been betting that the Asian nations, many of whose currencies are linked to the dollar through an overt peg or a "managed float" system, cannot keep pace with the American currency given the region's higher inflation rates and swelling trade gaps.
"They can no longer believe that there's a simple way of doing things," said Kenneth Courtis, chief economist at Deutsche Bank Group Asia-Pacific. "If you're going to tie your currency to another currency, you basically have to have the same monetary policies and the same type of economic development."
Asian currencies were mixed in the foreign-exchange market after the central bankers' announcement.
The bankers said that while economic fundamentals in the region remained "sound," they had asked local officials to assist the International Monetary Fund in studying arrangements for "facilities to assist" countries whose currencies were under attack.
The statement was aimed at curbing speculation in Asian currencies by making it more expensive for investors to bet against a currency, analysts said. "What they want to do is to reintroduce two-way risk," said Callum Henderson, managing currency analyst at MMS International S.& P. Asia in Hong Kong. "At the moment, it's a one-way bet."
Within the 11-country group, five members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations -- Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia -- also used the meeting to extend a currency-swap agreement that was established in 1977.
Thailand and Japan signed a pact last week under which Japan would come to the aid of the Thai currency, the baht, if needed. Officials declined to say at which level such help could be expected.
 
Dollar Strength Continues
(By The Associated Press) -- The dollar continued to strengthen in trading in Europe and New York yesterday, rising above 1.84 marks for the first time since July 1991.
Strong United States economic data, further doubts about the credibility of Europe's planned single currency and a French central banker's predictions of further dollar gains all combined to push the dollar up.
The dollar rose as high as 1.8403 marks, the strongest since July 1991, before settling in New York at 1.8384 marks, up from 1.8348 Thursday and up 2.5 percent for the week.
Against the yen, the dollar advanced to 117.02 yen in New York, up from 116.05 yen Thursday and the highest level since May 14. The pound fell to $1.6642 from $1.6745.

HEADLINE: Bond Prices Slide as Investors Await Data

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices slipped yesterday as investors waited for several economic reports next week for confirmation that inflation continues to be dormant.
Data on orders for durable goods and existing-home sales were released yesterday, but neither report affected the bond market much. Instead, investors were looking ahead to the quarterly Employment Cost Index on Tuesday, followed by a first look at second-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday and July's employment results on Friday. 
 About a dozen more economic reports will also be released in one of the busiest weeks of the year.
"The numbers will be very important next week," said Ken Anderson, who helps manage $7 billion in bonds for Evergreen Asset Management Corporation in Purchase, N.Y.
The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 6/32 yesterday, to 102 10/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.45 percent, from 6.43 percent on Thursday. A week ago, it was 6.52 percent.
Many investors remain bullish after Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, suggested earlier this week that he was in no hurry to raise interest rates. In semiannual testimony before Congress, Mr. Greenspan said the economy's combination of strong growth and low inflation was exceptional.
"It's going to be hard to derail the current rally," said Vic Thompson, who manages $105 billion of fixed-income assets at Boston's State Street Global Advisers. He said that he did not expect next week's reports to deflate investor optimism and that 30-year bond yields could fall to 6.10 percent by the end of the year.
"The mood is ebullient," said Ben Mayer, who helps manage $15 billion of bonds at AMR Investments in Fort Worth. "There is definitely the momentum" for 30-year Treasury yields to fall to 6.38 percent in the next few weeks, he said.
In the corporate bond market, GCI Inc., the Standard Commercial Corporation, Digital Television Services L.L.C. and three financial companies -- Norwest Financial Inc., Western Financial Bank and GBC Bancorp -- raised a combined $790 million yesterday, adding to this week's total of at least $7 billion in new bond sales.
Companies are rushing to sell debt as Treasury bond yields, the benchmark that companies use to price their debt, are near their lowest in almost eight months and as investor demand remains robust.
"It's nice to price into a market that's favorable," said Kevin Race, chief financial officer at Homeside Lending Inc., which sold $200 million of notes on Thursday. "We wanted to take advantage of that, and that's what we've done."

HEADLINE: Beliefs

BYLINE: By Peter Steinfels 

 BODY:
The nation's most widely shared religious ritual is undoubtedly the Sunday collection. It may also be one of the most mysterious.
Why, for example, do Mormons give more than 7 percent of their income to their church, while Christian Scientists and Unitarian-Universalists give less than 1 percent? 
 Why have contributions from Protestants, particularly those in liberal denominations, steadily slumped as a percentage of disposable income? Or, to take a question that has stirred sharp debate among Roman Catholics, why have they contributed at a rate, well under 1.5 percent of their income, roughly half that of Protestants?
Everyone has a favorite theory: One is that Catholics give less because they are angry over the Pope's stand on birth control. But there has been very little hard evidence -- until now.
"Money Matters" (Westminster John Knox Press, 1997) is a landmark study by two sociologists, Dean R. Hoge of Catholic University and Patrick McNamara of the University of New Mexico; an economist, Charles Zech of Villanova, and an independent researcher and writer, Michael J. Donahue. With support from the Lilly Endowment, the four authors profiled 625 congregations representing the diversity of churches in five denominations.
Two of the denominations were conservative and evangelical: the Assemblies of God and the Southern Baptist Convention. Two were moderate to liberal: the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). Catholics were the fifth group.
The authors collected data from each congregation about its receipts and expenditures, membership, programs, financial decision-making process, theological orientation and approach to giving.
They also surveyed a sample of each congregation's members, getting data on age, income levels, size of contributions, church involvement and satisfaction with the pastor, the denomination and the way church money was were raised and accounted for.
They checked these 11,000 questionnaires from laity against a national telephone survey of randomly selected Catholics, Lutherans and Presbyterians conducted by the Gallup Organization. Finally, they studied 12 financially successful congregations in depth.
"Money Matters" systematically reviews more than 20 hypotheses about why church members give large or small amounts. And many of the findings are surprising. Consider several popular explanations for the lower rate of giving by Catholics:
First, it is often said that Catholics give less because their parishes are generally much larger than most Protestant congregations. But the relationship between the amount of giving and smaller congregations turns out to be slight and inconsistent. A sense of community and ownership among congregants is important, the authors conclude, "but these qualities are not necessarily limited to smaller churches."
Another theory is that Catholics give less because their parishes are not democratic. "At most, a secondary factor," the authors say. "What is crucial is trust in leadership," and democratic procedures may or may not bring that about.
Even though Assemblies of God congregations have pro forma elections, "the ministers run the churches, and everyone accepts the situation as proper," the authors report. Giving is much higher than in the more democratic Presbyterian, Lutheran and Baptist congregations.
A third theory is that Catholics give less because they are angry with the Vatican or other church leaders. "Initially, we thought that the theory might be true," the authors say, "but now we conclude that it is largely false."
Catholics are more apt to feel they have an insufficient voice in parish financial decisions, the authors report, but "in our survey, Catholics are no angrier in general than the members of the other denominations." Anger about church teaching on birth control and women's ordination is "not associated with level of giving."
Nor do Catholics give less because they are paying for children in parish schools. Catholic families with children in parish schools actually give more than other families.
"Money Matters" does find a modest and sometimes indirect support for some other hypotheses about church contributions. But the largest factors, besides having affluent families to begin with and achieving a high level of church involvement, turn on theology.
In keeping with other studies, the book shows that religious groups with an evangelical theology and with practices that set members off from the prevailing culture inspire greater financial sacrifice.
Another important factor is the theological understanding of giving itself. The Assemblies of God and many Baptists expect members to tithe, to donate from 5 percent to 10 percent of their incomes, as a fulfillment of scriptural mandates, a sign of trust in God and a way to insure divine blessing.
Other religious groups, with a great deal of variation, emphasize stewardship, the biblical concept that the world is God's and that believers are temporary users accountable for a wise management of earthly resources.
The authors of "Money Matters" distinguish both concepts from simple fund-raising as matters of spiritual discipline, not just utilitarian means to an end. They "focus on the individual's need to give, not on the church's need to receive," they write, on "giving as an aspect of spiritual life and of people's relationship to God, not as merely a matter of meeting an institutional budget."
Tithing, of course, is clear-cut and effective but, to many pastors interviewed by the authors, theologically troubling. Appeals to stewardship are vaguer and their effectiveness is harder to measure, yet they clearly increase giving if congregants are led to ponder and pledge a yearly sum or percentage of income.
Just as "Money Matters" ultimately emphasizes theology, so does a parallel study by Robert Wuthnow, the Princeton sociologist of religion.
Bearing the all-purpose title "The Crisis in the Churches" (Oxford, 1997), the book is more revealingly subtitled: "Spiritual Malaise, Fiscal Woe." Mr. Wuthnow links the churches' financial future to an even wider agenda of teaching about faith, work, money and the marketplace.
More on that in a column in August -- closer, appropriately, to Labor Day.

HEADLINE: Lowest-Caste Hindu Takes Office as India's President

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, July 25

 BODY:
Half a century after Mohandas K. Gandhi led India to independence with a vision of a society that would rid itself of its ancient system of caste discrimination, a member of Hinduism's lowest caste took the oath today as the country's President and declared his elevation as proof that "the concerns of the common man" have finally taken precedence in the nation's affairs.
K. R. Narayanan, a 76-year-old former scholar, diplomat and Cabinet minister who once served as India's Ambassador to the United States, was chosen for the ceremonial post last week by an electoral college comprising all the country's federal and state lawmakers. While others have risen to be senior Cabinet ministers, top judges and high-ranking military officers, Mr. Narayanan is the first to realize Gandhi's standard of proof that India was finally resolved to stamp out the humiliations of the caste system -- the election of an untouchable as President. 
 Real power in India rests with the Prime Minister and Cabinet. But at a time when India seems destined to elect politically unstable coalition governments, some Indians believe that the President's role in choosing the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, judging who is most likely to be able to command a majority in Parliament, could see Mr. Narayanan emerge as crucially important political figure.
For the 150 million Indians who call themselves Dalits, a Hindi word meaning "the oppressed" that is now commonly used when referring to untouchables, Mr. Narayanan's story has the elements of a fable. He grew up in the southern state of Kerala in the 1930's at a time when untouchables were routinely denied the right to enter Hindu temples, draw water from wells reserved for Brahmins and other members of the higher castes, or walk along some village pathways; these restrictions still apply, even if they are unlawful, in many of India's 650,000 villages.
Because he was an outstanding student, rising from a village primary school to top academic honors at the London School of Economics, Mr. Narayanan found a way around obstacles that even today, consign many low-caste Indians to lives of social degradation. But well into adult life, he endured humiliations that would be recognizable to any untouchable, including an occasion when a university official in Kerala took exception to his wearing a silk-trimmed academic gown to classes, standard among Indian students of the time but judged unsuitable for a low-caste person who would traditionally have been restricted to scanty clothes like the loincloth that Gandhi often wore.
So today, the television images of Mr. Narayanan taking office had powerful symbolism all across India. Dressed in a cream-colored, high-buttoned suit of the kind named for Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister who approved Mr. Narayanan's entry into the Indian foreign service over the objections of high-caste officials, he rode in the gilded carriage once used by Britain's Viceroys, pulled by six gleaming horses and protected from the beating sun of the Indian summer by a red-and-gold parasol. Mounted lancers rode beside him with plumed pith helmets, and honor guards from the armed forces stood ramrod still as he passed by in review.
In his address in the ornate Central Hall of India's Parliament, Mr. Narayanan, who previously served as Vice President, began with a salute to the lawmakers who chose him in a ballot last week in which he won 95 percent of the votes, defeating the only other candidate, a former election commissioner, T. S. Seshan. Mr. Seshan, a well-known maverick, greeted his defeat with an angry outburst, telling reporters that it was "an insult" to Mr. Narayanan that the mainly upper-caste lawmakers chose him, in Mr. Seshan's words, "only because he was a Dalit."
Mr. Narayanan made it clear that he thought Mr. Seshan had gotten matters upside down.
"That the nation has found a consensus for its highest office in someone who has sprung from the grass-roots of our society and grown up in the dust and heat of this sacred land is symbolic of the fact that the concerns of the common man have now moved to the center stage of our social and political life," he said. "It is this larger significance of my election rather than any personal sense of honor that makes me rejoice on this occasion."
Mr. Narayanan went on to offer a stinging rebuke to the country's politicians, who applauded him repeatedly even as he politely condemned them.
With barely three weeks to go to the 50th anniversary of India's independence from Britain, he recalled Gandhi's ambition that a free India would "wipe every tear from every eye" by eliminating the country's ancient scourges, including poverty, disease, illiteracy and caste discrimination -- ills that are still pervasive, leaving India close to the bottom of virtually every international index of social progress. Among other things, India's official statistics say nearly 350 million of the country's 960 million people still live in deep poverty.
Gandhi, Mr. Narayanan said, described true democracy as "what promotes the welfare of the people," but the new President argued that the current generation of Indian politicians had placed personal ambition ahead of the abolition of poverty, ignorance and disease.
"Excessive obsession with the pursuit of pure politics has often overshadowed the social, economic and developmental needs of our people," he said. "Can we not sink our differences, as we have done on critical occasions in our history, and devote our undivided attention, for a time, to the development of the economy and the welfare of the people?"
But many Indian commentators shared Mr. Seshan's view that there was tokenism in Mr. Narayanan's appointment, and others said Mr. Narayanan had been co-opted by the Brahmins and other upper-caste Indians who still dominate in the country's politics, civil service and top corporations. A nephew of the new President told Outlook, a leading Indian news magazine, that Mr. Narayanan had turned his back on his caste origins, calling his uncle a "Harijan Brahmin."
But another view was that Mr. Narayanan could play a key role in encouraging lower-caste Indians to believe that there is a place for them in a caste-free society, instead of throwing in their lot with caste-based political parties that have become increasingly powerful as the Congress Party, the all-embracing vehicle of Gandhi and Nehru, has faded from its once all-conquering position.
The most powerful of these groups, the Bahujana Samaj Party, has used wily political horse-trading to gain power in Uttar Pradesh, the country's biggest state, with 140 million people. Low-caste political leaders, including Mayawati, the fiery Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh, have dismissed Gandhi's gospel of social inclusion for untouchables as a sham.
Indian newspapers often carry accounts of upper-caste village men escaping punishment after raping untouchable women, or parading them naked along village paths, or shaving their heads, usually for some alleged transgression of caste traditions. The response of Mr. Mayawati has been to order reverse discrimination, dismissing, demoting or transferring thousands of upper-caste civil servants and replacing them with untouchables, and ordering the arrest of thousands of people for alleged caste discrimination.
The Indian Express, one of the country's most powerful newspapers, expressed the hope that Mr. Narayanan's arrival as President would quell the turn toward caste-based politics. It said in an editorial that the appointment "advertises the fact that social mobility is no mere directive principle -- it can be an actual fact."

HEADLINE: U.S. Links Top Bosnia Serbs to Attacks

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
The United States has concluded that senior Bosnian Serb leaders are orchestrating attacks on NATO troops and senior Administration officials said today that NATO would retaliate if the incidents continued.
The attacks have presumably come in response to the arrest of one war-crimes suspect and the killing of another. The persistence and severity of the attacks -- which American and NATO officials initially discounted as isolated incidents, often involving drunken Serbs -- have raised concerns about the security of the 30,000 NATO-led troops in Bosnia. 
 A senior Administration official in Washington said there would be "serious consequences" in the event of "even one more such action."
"We've had enough of this," the official said.
Administration officials declined to specify how NATO forces would retaliate, though one said commanders in Bosnia had virtually unlimited authority to act when faced with a threat to the NATO troops.
The first steps are likely to be diplomatic, but the officials said the next ones could include cracking down on television broadcasts the Serbs have used to incite attacks and seizing caches of weapons the Serbs were required to warehouse as part of the Dayton peace accords.
In recent days, a parade of American and European envoys has denounced the attacks and warned Bosnian Serb leaders in their stronghold, Pale, against inciting attacks.
Today's sharper warnings came after yet another attack on NATO forces. Before dawn this morning, an American soldier's car was damaged by a firebomb in Vlasenica, a village in the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia, according to a statement issued by the American military headquarters in Tuzla. No one was injured and the fire was extinguished.
While no one has been killed in the series of attacks, several troops have been injured, including a Dutch soldier who was wounded by shrapnel from a grenade attack in Kotor Varos and an American who was attacked by an unknown prowler outside his home, also in Vlasenica.
The attacks, which initially were written off as isolated incidents, began after the surprise operation by NATO forces on July 10 in which British special forces killed a Serbian official indicted for war crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague and arrested another in a separate raid.
The actions against the suspects, who had been charged in sealed indictments, reflected a new resolve by NATO to enforce the terms of the Dayton accords, including the capture of suspected war criminals.
The arrests also struck fear in the Bosnian Serbs, particularly those in Pale, the nationalist stronghold still dominated by Radovan Karadzic, the former president of the Bosnian Serbs, who himself is under indictment on war-crimes charges.
In public statements, Bosnian Serb leaders have denounced the arrests, but at the same time urged people not to retaliate. However, television and radio broadcasts have been increasingly inflammatory, and in recent days posters have appeared defending Dr. Karadzic.
At first, NATO's commanders discounted the idea that the attacks might be coordinated, and officials here in Washington, while denouncing them, played down their seriousness.
"In the last day or two, some of the people subscribing to that view have begun to change," another official said today. "This turnaround is particularly pronounced at the Pentagon."
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there is evidence of the involvement of the Interior Minister, Dragan Kajic, who is known to follow the orders of Dr. Karadzic. Mr. Kajic was at the center of the recent power struggle among Serbian leaders, when the Bosnian Serb president, Biljana Plavsic, tried to fire him. Dr. Karadzic's supporters retaliated by expelling Mrs. Plavsic from the ruling party and demanding her resignation.
The officials said they would also hold the Bosnian political leadership responsible, including Momcilo Krajisnik, who holds the Serbian seat on the three-member presidency ruling all of Bosnia.
The officials said the attacks would not force NATO to back away from its more aggressive approach to the mission in Bosnia, including more arrests of war-crimes suspects. However, in recent days, NATO officials have indicated that more arrests are not planned for now.
Over the last few days, the American representative to the United Nations, Bill Richardson, and the American special envoy for Bosnia, Robert S. Gelbard, have traveled through the region and called for an end to the attacks.
One Administration official in Washington said NATO was stepping up its warnings to demonstrate its resolve to the Serbs.
The United States has also succeeded in forcing the International Monetary Fund to postpone for at least two months the release of $38 million in loans for Croatia.
The Administration has pressed the fund and other international financial institutions, like the World Bank, to deny Croatia assistance until President Franjo Tudjman does more to live up to the terms of the Dayton accords, including the arrests of war criminals.
The money was the second installment of a $486 million, three-year loan approved by the I.M.F. earlier this year, but the fund's directors, meeting in Washington, agreed to delay an economic review that would have freed up the money, fund and Administration officials said.

HEADLINE: New! The Itty-Bitty Body Politic

BYLINE: By Jeff MacGregor; Jeff MacGregor is a humor writer living in Manhattan.

 BODY:
So you wanna know about Tamagotchi(TM), the Virtual Reality Pet, eh? Well, who doesn't! . . . Tamagotchi has been incredibly popular, and manufacturing is working at full capacity to try to catch up with demand. . . . With proper care and feeding (accomplished by pushing buttons on the egg), Tamagotchi quickly grow into adorable virtual reality pets in a wide variety of shapes and personalities.
-- From the Web site of the maker of the popular Tamagotchi toy
 
 No computer games on Government time!
-- From a press release by Senator Lauch Faircloth, Republican of North Carolina, announcing a bill that would ban computer games in Federal offices
 We at Joy Fun Toy Technologies agree with the Senator! Get rid of computer games, and instead give each member of Congress NANOVOTER(TM), a CONSTITUENT CARE SIMULATION GAME(R) (sample enclosed; instructions appended). Developed for use by U.S. Congresspersons of every party stripe, it is made to teach the tough responsibilities of keeping just one (1) American voter happy with good care. Time management and political skills are needed! Not simply more government wastage or fun frivolousness, this cyber-electronic learning toy helps you keep your home state or district in the tiptop pink and smiling! Learn how! With NANOVOTER(TM)!
The object is to service NANOVOTER(TM) like a genuine registered-to-vote person. If you dote and coddle, NANOVOTER(TM) will grow healthy and strong! Your reward is re-election, perhaps in gaudy landslide style! Bad care, though, alienates NANOVOTER(TM); it becomes a puny thing, and vengeance-seeking. It will demand a recall! Or a special prosecutor, maybe! Split tickets next fall, you can bet!
So use good caring skills, or NANOVOTER(TM) wanders off and you are left to the sadness of the private sector. Be wary!
 
CONTROL
 Cancel/Reset/Mode Select
Move Left
Move Right
Move Center
PRESS TO START
There are two different game speed modes for NANOVOTER(TM): normal (off-year) and 4X game speed (election year).
 
MONITOR
Remember, the NANOVOTER(TM) is mostly helpless and extra needy! Be sure to take its temperature! (See FOCUS GROUP icon, below.) Keep your thumb on the pulse! (See POLLSTER function.)
(IMPORTANT: if the NANOVOTER(TM) gets sick and tired, call in the SPIN DOCTOR without delay!!!)
 
FEEDING TIME
Your little voter will always seem hungry. It is! Remember that NANOVOTER(TM) is part of a growing economy -- so feed it a big piece of the American Dream Pie if it wants one! Not enough? Press and two little chickens go cluck into every pot. More? Roll out the pig-in-a-barrel! Your NANOVOTER(TM) has a healthy big appetite for pork! Oink!
(If NANOVOTER(TM) begins losing weight, press and to issue A.F.D.C. coupons; check employment status right away!)
 
SLEEPTIME
Your NANOVOTER(TM) needs plenty of rest. When you see it snoring, be sure to turn out the lights. Best to keep your little voter in total darkness now. Ah, sleepytime. At last you can get some real work done! Entertain most-favored lobbyists in well-upholstered, open-bar posh fashion! Sell off underutilized national forests! Take a fact-finding junket to the N.F.L. Superbowl!
Shhhhh though; NANOVOTER(TM) is a light sleeper and cranky when roused. Caution!
 
PLAYTIME
Amusing the NANOVOTER(TM) is very important. Play time keeps little ones happy and distracted. Thriving! There are two games you can play:
Game 1 is HIDE AND SEEK. Can NANOVOTER(TM) find the Congressional pay increase rider in your new Disaster Relief Bill? Better move fast!
Game 2 is WHICH WITCH IS WHICH? Take your little one hunting! Follow the paper trail of campaign contributions! Game ends when the face of Old Joe McCarthy displayed. A favorite!
With each success NANOVOTER(TM) is happy! But bad results can mean despair.
 
CLEANING TIME
Sometimes your NANOVOTER(TM) makes a mess. Icky-stinky! Do you have to clean it up? Not unless your NANOVOTER(TM) owns Lippo Bank!
 
MEDICINE
Sometimes NANOVOTER(TM) feels sickly and will beg for national health care. NANOVOTER(TM) is out of its head with fever, maybe! Better to give the national economy a shot in the arm -- then everyone feels good! If no improvement, offer increased Medicare co-payments indexed to capital gains tax abatement. NANOVOTER(TM) doesn't always know what's good for it.
 
DISCIPLINE
Sometimes your NANOVOTER(TM) misbehaves. Threaten to reformulate its Social Security by pressing and at once. (NOT valid in 4X election year mode. If A.A.R.P. representative is displayed, press fast to backpedal.) NANOVOTERS(TM) need tough love!
 
POCKETBOOK ICON
When displayed you have 60 seconds to promise balanced budget; hold TV press conference () to call for tightening of the Beltway! Not to do so risks a dire decline in your approval ratings! Hurry!
 
ATTENTION ICON
If Sam Donaldson face appears, check your NANOVOTER(TM) immediately! Trouble lies ahead!
 
SUCCESS
Tender loving care is all your NANOVOTER(TM) needs to flourish! If not, simply push the usual buttons to restart game. Good luck!

U.S. Ambassador Is an Heir Right Under Swiss Eyes
Madeleine Kunin, the Swiss-born American ambassador to Switzerland, was surprised to discover her mother's name on the list of dormant accounts she herself had cajoled Swiss bankers to publish. 1
 
A complex set of schisms has developed between parties interested in the list of dormant World War II-era accounts published by Swiss banks. Paul Volcker, head of an independent investigative commission, warned that a class action suit that claims the assets of Holocaust victims are languishing in Swiss bank vaults could impede his team's progress and snuff out vital Swiss collaboration. 5
 
U.S. Sees Bosnian Serb Scheme
Attacks on NATO troops are being orchestrated by some Bosnian Serb leaders, senior officials have concluded. The United States and NATO vowed to be resolute if "even one more such action" occurred. An American soldier's car was firebombed in Vlasenica, a village in the Serb-controlled part of Bosnia. No one was injured. 5
 
Untouchable to Lead India
K.R. Narayanan became India's first "untouchable" President. He told Parliament and the nation that his election to the post symbolized the long-awaited arrival of an era when "the concerns of the common man" had taken precedence in the nation's affairs. 3
 
New Use for Cambodian Guns
Heavily armed troops were deployed around Phnom Penh, briefed to prevent high school students from cheating on their final exams. Photocopy shops were also guarded. Teachers in Cambodia are paid around $20 a month and bribery is widespread. The Government's crackdown follows its coup weeks ago. 4
 
Housing Angers East Jerusalem
The decision by the city government of Jerusalem to allow an American Jewish financier to build Jewish housing in an Arab neighborhood of East Jerusalem caught Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu off guard. He vowed to block the plan, which enraged Palestinians. 2
 
Albright Attends Asean Talks
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright arrived in Malaysia for meetings with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations on how Hun Sen might be persuaded to hold legitimate elections after the coup in Cambodia. Washington has suspended its aid to Cambodia for 30 days. 4
 
Strike Talks Resume in Israel
Israel's skies were quiet as flights were stopped and telephone communications were often cut by workers striking against plans to privatize Bezek, the country's telephone monopoly. After Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called the leaders of the Histadrut labor federation "Bolshevik dinosaurs" and they accused him of acting like a "Bolshevik regime," the strike was called off and negotiations resumed. 3

Ex-G.O.P. Chairmen Offer Differing Accounts of Loan
One former Republican National chairman contradicted another as Richard Richards told the Senate campaign finance inquiry that Haley Barbour had stressed an urgent need for a $2.1-million foreign loan guarantee to "free up" funds for Republican candidates in their 1994 campaign to take control of Congress. 1

Congress Adds Disability Aid
Congressional Republicans bowed to President Clinton's demands and tentatively agreed to restore disability benefits to more than half a million legal immigrants, as budget negotiators broke a week-long impasse. Republicans also agreed to extend Medicaid coverage to tens of thousands of children who will lose their disability benefits under the welfare law that President Clinton signed last August. 1

Caretaker Seeks Reward
The caretaker who stumbled on the hideout of Andrew P. Cunanan has filed a lawsuit in Dade County Circuit Court to claim a total of $65,000 in reward money that had been offered for the apprehension of Mr. Cunanan. Mr. Cunanan, who had been sought in the murder of five men, including the fashion designer, Gianni Versace, fatally shot himself on a houseboat in Miami Beach after the police were called by the caretaker. 6
 
Notoriety Follows Ex-Suspect
It has been almost a year since Richard A. Jewell was first identified by The Atlanta Journal as the focus of the Federal investigation into the July 27 bombing at Centennial Olympic Park. It has been almost nine months since the Justice Department cleared him of any involvement in the deadly attack. And yet, Mr. Jewell, 34, lives with his unwanted notoriety every day and his bitterness remains strikingly raw. 6
 
An internal Justice Department investigation into the bombing in Atlanta has concluded that a F.B.I. interview of Mr. Jewell was seriously flawed and resulted from a breakdown of communications within the law enforcement agency, Government officials said. 6
 
G.M. and Union Reach Accord
General Motors and the United Automobile Workers reached a tentative pact to end a strike at a transmission factory that had forced the company to idle six other plants. 7
 
Chrysler Seats Scrutinized
The Chrysler Corporation sent instructional videos last week to about 135,000 customers after receiving complaints that child seats built into its mini-vans malfunctioned. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating the matter. No injuries or deaths have been attributed to the seats, Chrysler and the Federal safety agency said. 7

Senate Backs Treaty Change
The Senate unanimously urged the Clinton Administration not to pursue a treaty that would limit the industrial world's emissions of greenhouse gases unless the agreement requires developing countries to control their rapidly growing emissions at the same time. 8

Jury Finds Gigante Guilty On Racketeering Charges
Vincent Gigante, the enigmatic figure known for wearing a bathrobe and pajamas in public, was convicted of being a powerful Mafia kingpin who conspired in plots to kill other gangland figures and who ran lucrative rackets in New York. At the same time, though, the jury in Federal District Court in Brooklyn acquitted him of ordering three gangland killings and could not agree on charges that he ordered four other murders. 1

Law enforcement officials said Mr. Gigante's racketeering conviction was unlikely to immediately weaken the Genovese crime family's powerful underworld position, since his active role as boss of the gang was reduced in recent years by intense law-enforcement pressure and a heart ailment. 25

Conviction in Cosby Trial
A Federal jury in Manhattan convicted Autumn Jackson of trying to extort $40 million from Bill Cosby, the man she claimed was her father. When she is sentenced on Oct. 22, she could receive a prison term of up to 12 years for her convictions on extortion and two other charges, conspiracy and traveling across state lines to commit the offenses. Her attorney said he planned to appeal the verdict and that Ms. Jackson is also considering a paternity suit against the actor. 1

Forced Labor Inquiry Expands
Federal agents raided two houses in a small North Carolina city and found more than a dozen illegal Mexican immigrants, most of them deaf, who officials believe were coerced into peddling trinkets at local shopping centers and giving most of the proceeds to "bosses" who oversaw the operation. The United States Attorney in Greensboro, N.C., said prosecutors were exploring whether the operation in Sanford was linked to the people charged last week in New York City with holding dozens of deaf Mexican peddlers in virtual slavery. 1
 
Crime Falls in New Jersey
Overall violent crime dropped 11 percent across New Jersey last year. The decline was far greater than the 7 percent decrease in violent crimes across the nation. 23

BUSINESS DAY 33-47

Columbia Chairman Resigns
The top executive of the world's largest health care company, the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, resigned amid a growing criminal investigation of the company's business practices. Richard L.

HEADLINE: Flake May Leave the Congress For an Expanded Church Role

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Representative Floyd H. Flake, an 11-year incumbent who also leads a sprawling congregation in Queens, said yesterday that he was considering retiring from Congress at the end of his current term to devote more attention to the church he has been pastor of for 21 years.
While Mr. Flake, a 52-year-old Democrat, said in an interview that he planned to make a decision within the next two weeks, several people who are close to him said that he had decided not to seek a seventh term in Congress, and that he would announce his decicion to his congregation next week. 
 Rumors of Mr. Flake's deliberations have traveled in political circles in Queens for several months as some thought that the Congressman might seek the position of bishop in the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in Jamaica, Queens. And although he declined to seek that post, that has not stopped several Democratic politicians from discussing a possible run for his seat in the 1998 Congressional elections.
The name mentioned most prominently by Queens Democrats is Gregory W. Meeks, 43, a state assemblyman with close ties to Mr. Flake who is also the chairman of the state Council of Black Elected Democrats. Another is State Assemblywoman Barbara M. Clark, 58, who has been in office since 1987 and has already begun discussing fund-raising strategies, several political officials said. Also, State Senator Alton R. Waldon Jr., 60, is said to be interested in the seat.
Archie Spigner, one of the City Council's most senior members, is also mentioned as a possible contender. Mr. Spigner yesterday described the idea of a Congressional race as "a rather stimulating concept," but declined to discuss the matter further. Mr. Meeks and Mr. Waldon were traveling yesterday and could not be reached, their staff members said. Ms. Clark did not respond to telephone messages.
Mr. Flake said he was considering leaving Congress because his duties to the Allen A.M.E. Church will expand with the opening of a $23 million, 2,500-seat cathedral. "I have a certain standard in terms of attending to my Congressional and church responsibilities," Mr. Flake said. "And I'm not certain I could really keep pace."
A Democrat who has leveraged his political power with Republicans to gain economic clout for his church in southeast Queens, Mr. Flake has developed a formidable social-service and economic empire at Allen A.M.E. that many suggest far outpaces the one established a generation earlier by Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. in Harlem.
Under the pastorship of Mr. Flake, who was once a Xerox Corporation market analyst, Allen A.M.E. has established an elementary school for about 500 students, a 300-unit senior citizens complex, a bus chartering corporation and a community center that operates a health clinic and a Head Start program. The church's development corporation has also purchased commercial storefronts.
Mr. Flake said that he did not wish to discuss any potential successor. "The seat is not vacant and, God knows, it may not be," he said. The Sixth Congressional District includes most of southeastern Queens, and includes the neighborhoods of Jamaica, St. Albans, Cambria Heights, Laurelton and South Ozone Park. It also includes the western portion of the Rockaway peninsula.
The new Allen Cathedral, which will have its first worship services on Sunday, will be the second-largest predominantly African-American church in New York City, after the Concord Baptist Church in Brooklyn.
Mr. Flake is known as an independent Democrat. He has decided not to join with the Queens Democratic organization, which has endorsed the mayoral candidacy of Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President. Mr. Flake said yesterday that he would not make a mayoral endorsement this year. "I feel favorably disposed to the positive things that have happened to New York in the last three years," he said, adding that his words should not be construed as an endorsement of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "But if the economy is up and crime is down, it's difficult to fight against the things you have fought for all of your life."
Mr. Flake has sometimes run into difficulties during his stewardship. In 1990, after a former church secretary's testimony to a grand jury in Brooklyn accused Mr. Flake of financial improprieties, Federal prosecutors charged the Congressman and his wife, Margarett Elaine, with not reporting $177,578 in income from the church and dodging Federal income taxes. The following year, three weeks into the trial, prosecutors, their approach derailed by an early ruling by the judge, dropped the charges against the Flakes.
But later in 1991, the Justice Department brought a civil suit against Mr. Flake, accusing him of improperly using Federal housing funds to build a portion of the church school. In a settlement in 1994, Mr. Flake and his church agreed to repay the $500,000 with interest but admitted no wrongdoing.

HEADLINE: Senate Urges U.S. to Pursue New Strategy On Emissions

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr. 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
The Senate unanimously urged the Clinton Administration today not to pursue a treaty that would limit the industrial world's emissions of greenhouse gases unless the agreement requires developing countries to control their rapidly growing emissions at the same time.
While it is not binding, the Senate resolution complicates the continuing negotiations for a new treaty to prevent global warming caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide as people burn more fossil fuel. 
 The Senate would have to consent by a two-thirds vote to the ratification of any such treaty by the United States. The resolution criticizing the Administration's current negotiating approach passed, 95 to 0.
In the debate, many senators expressed skepticism that global warming was a serious problem or that the United States, as the leading emitter of gases like carbon dioxide that trap heat from the sun, should do more than poorer nations to reverse it.
But even those senators who favor a treaty voted for the resolution after its chief sponsor, Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, expressly endorsed the scientific consensus behind the global warming theory and signaled that less developed countries ought to be granted more flexibility in cutting emissions, as long as they accept the treaty commitments.
The final negotiations for the treaty are to be made at a meeting in Kyoto, Japan, at the end of the year.The next round of bargaining is to begin next week in Bonn. The resolution that passed the Senate today disputes a basic premise of those talks: that the first and biggest steps ought to be taken by industrial nations like the United States.
Senator Byrd, a Democrat, said the proposal offered by the Administration in the talks was "simply unacceptable." That proposal would set binding limits on emissions of heat-trapping gases by industrial nations in the medium term, while deferring the time when developing nations would have to accept similar limits.
Mr. Byrd's resolution is supported by energy producing and consuming industries, especially the coal industry, which sustains the West Virginia economy and is powerful in many other states. Industry lobbyists have argued that reducing such gases threatens their prosperity.
Andrew Card, president of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association, called the vote "a wake-up call to the Administration to adopt a more open and realistic approach to global climate negotiations."
But Tim Wirth, the Under Secretary of State for global environmental affairs, tried to put the best light on the situation, saying after the vote that "we support the thrust of the Byrd resolution," and added: "We have been further out front than any country in pressing for developing-country commitments. The U.S. is much more aggressive than anyone else, and this strengthens our hand."
Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, a Democrat, and John H. Chafee of Rhode Island, a Republican, joined with Mr. Byrd in a carefully scripted colloquy on the floor during which they all seemed to agree that each country should make, as Senator Byrd put it, "unique and binding contributions of a pace and kind consistent with their industrialization."
Mr. Byrd added, "The developing world must agree in Kyoto to adopt some manner of binding targets and commitments which would begin during the same compliance period as the developed world, in as aggressive and effective a schedule as possible."
A scripted discussion in a Senate debate is important because it provides a legislative history intended to clarify the intention of a resolution.
Mr. Byrd also said his resolution "accepts the thesis, which is still the subject of some dispute," that global warming is a real problem.
Many scientists believe the warming of the planet could cause ocean levels to rise and would severely disrupt the earth's biological systems. Such a trend is likely, they say, because increasing levels of carbon dioxide and other gases trap heat from the sun in a process similar to what happens in a greenhouse.
In the colloquy, Mr. Kerry built support for the Administration's plan to allow developing and developed nations to trade credits with one another for reducing emissions, a plan intended to reduce the costs faced by industrial nations while decreasing the pollution generated by developing nations.
But the debate also highlighted strong feelings among some lawmakers against any treaty whatsoever. Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, accused President Clinton of using his "bully pulpit to terrorize the American people," and of "building a propaganda campaign" to support a new treaty.

HEADLINE: Orders in June For Durables Rose by 2.3%

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
Orders for durable goods rose 2.3 percent in June, more than expected, with half the increase coming from a flood of orders for commercial aircraft, the Commerce Department said today.
A separate report showed that home resales fell 2.6 percent in June. 
 Excluding the often-volatile category of transportation equipment, June's orders for durable goods increased eight-tenths of 1 percent.
In May, orders for durable goods, which are expensive items meant to last at least three years, fell a revised four-tenths of 1 percent. The decline had previously been reported as seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Economists caution it is difficult to discern trends from month-to-month shifts in the orders because they are heavily influenced by changes in orders for commercial jetliners and military weapons. Still, the June increase was another indication that the economy remained on a path of moderate growth, which should keep Federal Reserve policy makers from raising interest rates.
"Despite the unexpected strength of June orders, the trend in orders is not alarming," said Christopher Low, economist at HSBC Markets Inc. in New York.
During June, the Boeing Company, which is the world's largest civilian aircraft maker, received orders for 156 planes, bringing orders for the year to 224, or about $16 billion.
Excluding military hardware, orders increased 2.1 percent last month, the fifth increase in six months.
Unfilled orders, a gauge of pent-up demand, rose three-tenths of 1 percent in June on the heels of May's revised gain of one-tenth of 1 percent. Shipments, a measure of current demand, rose 1.8 percent after having fallen 1.5 percent in May.
In the report on June's home resales, the National Association of Realtors said resales fell 2.6 percent, to an annual rate of 4.14 million, the fourth decline in the last six months. Resales increased a revised 4.7 percent in May.
"While there has been a slight tapering off, the market has remained strong due to favorable economic conditions over all," the association's president, Russell Booth, said. "We expect this activity to continue with no major surges or dropoffs in the near future."
The figures represent actual closings, which lag behind contract signings by a few months. David Resler, an economist with Nomura Securities in New York, said before today's report that "these transactions would have gone to contract in March or April, just as people were getting ready to pay their taxes, not put a deposit on a house."
By region, resales fell 7.7 percent in the Northeast, to a 600,000 annual rate; were unchanged in the South, at a 1.58 million annual rate; rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in the Midwest, to a 1.08 million annual rate, and fell 6.4 percent in the West, to a 880,000 annual rate.
Home resales make up about 85 percent of all single-family home sales in the United States.

HEADLINE: A Gentler Hand at Columbia's Helm

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
In Thomas F. Frist Jr., Columbia/HCA Healthcare has the friendlier face it needs to reassure investors and perhaps strike a deal with Federal investigators.
Dr. Frist agreed to sell his Hospital Corporation of America to Richard L. Scott's company in 1993, seeing in Mr. Scott an aggressive manager better able to run the world's largest hospital chain. But as Federal investigators swarmed and allegations of wrongdoing multiplied, Dr. Frist questioned whether Mr. Scott had gone several steps too far. 
 "At any institution, there is a time for a different style to take it to the next level," Dr. Frist said yesterday, later adding, "There is a trust level that is not there."
Although Dr. Frist had offered some incentives for doctors to send their patients his way, he stopped short of Columbia/HCA's practice of making them investors in his hospitals. He is now scrapping this policy at Columbia/HCA.
And if the Hospital Corporation of America faced its share of challenges and lawsuits from aggrieved competitors and doctors, it was never confronted by Federal investigations of the nature facing Columbia/HCA.
Mr. Scott wears his intensity on his sleeve. Dr. Frist, whose brother, Bill, is a Republican Senator from Tennessee, comes across as a folksy Southerner -- Big Tommy, is his nickname.
"With Tommy, you really got the impression of a person who was comfortable in his position of authority," said Jeff Goldsmith, a hospital strategist.
Dr. Frist had urged Mr. Scott to lighten up. When the company headquarters were in Louisville, Ky., Dr. Frist successfully urged Mr. Scott to delay his 6 A.M. Monday teleconferences by an hour, complaining that the time difference forced him to stand ready at 5 A.M. in Nashville.
Unlike Mr. Scott, who is a lawyer, Dr. Frist is a doctor who made his career in the hospital business. Trained as a surgeon, Dr. Frist served as a flight surgeon in the Vietnam War but never practiced. Instead, he founded the Hospital Corporation of America with his father and another partner in 1968.
He was inspired by a fraternity brother whose father started the Holiday Inn chain, transforming an industry and bringing computerization, standardization and economies of scale. Obsessed with overcoming the stereotype of doctors as poor managers, he built and bought his way into making his company the nation's largest hospital chain by the late 1980's.
As Medicare cut payments, however, the Hospital Corporation of America and other chains fell from favor with investors. Dr. Frist and backers, including Richard Rainwater, responded by taking the company private in 1988 then public again in 1992. Mr. Rainwater, who was building his own hospital chain with Mr. Scott, was central in arranging the companies' merger in 1993.
Dr. Frist, 58, received a bachelor's degree from Vanderbilt and his M.D. from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. As Columbia's vice chairman until he became chairman and chief executive yesterday, Dr. Frist is also the company's largest individual shareholder. His 14.6 million shares, or 2.2 percent of the company, were worth $524.7 million at yesterday's close.

HEADLINE: TALKS ON BUDGET YIELD AN ACCORD ON DISABILITY AID

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 25

 BODY:
Congressional Republicans bowed to President Clinton's demands today and tentatively agreed to restore disability benefits to more than half a million legal immigrants, as budget negotiators broke a weeklong impasse and began making progress on several bitterly contested issues.
The Republicans also agreed to continue Medicaid coverage for tens of thousands of children who would otherwise lose it, along with their disability benefits, under the welfare law that the President signed last August. 
 After a day of talks on Capitol Hill between senior Republicans and Administration officials, negotiators were making headway more quickly on restraining spending to balance the budget by 2002 than they were on cutting taxes. But today's progress suggested that they might reach agreement on spending and taxes alike in time for Congress to pass both bills and send them to Mr. Clinton before leaving for the summer recess next Friday.
Negotiators pared their ranks today to the most senior participants, who met in the offices of the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, and Speaker Newt Gingrich. Aides said tonight that both sides, having adopted a get-it-done attitude, were spending less time posturing and speechifying and more time resolving specific issues.
The talks broke up shortly before 8 P.M., and Mr. Clinton's negotiating team returned to the White House to brief him. The negotiators plan to meet again at 11 A.M. on Saturday in hopes of resolving the outstanding issues.
"They're making a lot of progress on the spending side," a senior Administration official said.
But another White House official cautioned tonight, "A lot of work remains to be done."
Earlier in the day, Mr. Clinton sounded an optimistic note about the talks. "I think we're going to get this agreement," he said. But he also continued to pick apart the Republican tax-cutting plan, declaring that it fell far short of commitments to defray the cost of higher education that Congressional Republicans had made in the preliminary budget agreement.
Republicans agreed today to address two of Mr. Clinton's chief criticisms of the law overhauling the nation's welfare system, which he signed last Aug. 22. That law cut off most benefits for legal immigrants as of this fall.
Mr. Clinton criticized the law at the time for denying benefits to certain immigrants -- those legally living in the United States when he signed the bill -- if they were disabled, or became disabled later. He also said the law erred in changing the requirements for providing Supplemental Security Income to families with disabled children, so that tens of thousands of children would not qualify, and therefore also risked losing their Medicaid coverage.
Republicans agreed today to continue the disability benefits for legal immigrants and to extend Medicaid coverage for those children who lose the S.S.I. benefits.
Members of the Congressional Budget Office estimated that the agreement struck today would affect about 500,000 legal immigrants who were already disabled as of August. But it also estimated that one-third of those people could have ultimately received benefits anyway, because they would become citizens by 2000.
Congressional staff members said the changes would also help an additional 125,000 people who are estimated to become disabled in the future.
And 20,000 to 30,000 children are expected to benefit from the decision to continue Medicaid coverage.
Despite the progress on those two issues, several crucial disagreements over welfare remain, including the application of minimum-wage and other labor laws to welfare recipients in community service and workfare programs.
The principal author of the 1996 welfare law, Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., the Florida Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, was not in the room during the negotiations. His aides said tonight that he wanted to see the entire package of welfare changes before passing judgment.
The compromise reached tonight may prove unpalatable to Republicans who considered the curtailing of benefits for immigrants an important part of the 1996 law.
Negotiating for the Republicans today, in addition to Mr. Lott and Mr. Gingrich, were Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, chairman of the House Budget Committee. The White House negotiators were Erskine B. Bowles, the chief of staff; Franklin D. Raines, the budget director; Gene Sperling, the economic policy adviser, and John Hilley, the Congressional liaison.
As the senior budget negotiators huddled, Mr. Clinton continued his drumbeat of criticism of the Republican tax-cut plan. He said it would fail to defray the costs of higher education, a goal to which Congressional Republicans agreed in the preliminary budget accord.
In a speech to elementary-school principals in northern Virginia, the President jockeyed for the political high ground by portraying himself as the guardian of fiscal discipline and the protector of the middle class.
"The tax cut has to, first of all, put middle-class families who need the relief most at the heart of its objectives," Mr. Clinton declared.
Mr. Clinton also warned that he would oppose tax cuts that would cause the budget deficit "to explode in the out years."
"We have been handicapped severely for years and years and years because we went on a binge of deficit spending in the early 80's that we couldn't break," he said.
Around the edges, other politicians tried either to speed the negotiations or to slow them.
Republicans on Capitol Hill tried to speed them. They said they feared that it would be more difficult to pass such legislation in September than now. "It would be a real loss of momentum," said the Senate majority whip, Don Nickles of Oklahoma.
Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who leads the Senate Finance Committee, urged the President to release new Administration budget estimates, which are believed to show that the strong economy is shrinking the Federal deficit even more quickly than already expected.
"This is great news, and should not remain hidden," Mr. Roth said in a written statement. "A booming economy should allow us to provide a much larger tax cut for hard-working Americans."
For their part, an influential group of Senate Democrats said Mr. Clinton should be in no hurry to negotiate. Trying to stiffen Mr. Clinton's resolve and perhaps to strengthen his bargaining position, the nine Democratic members of the Senate Finance Committee called on the President to wait the Republicans out.
In a letter to Mr. Clinton, the nine Senators said: "We are troubled by the direction of the budget negotiations currently under way between the Administration and the Congress. The most recent Republican proposals on both the tax and spending bills move toward the House in many respects, which we find unacceptable."
Speaking before the negotiations were finished for tonight, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the committee's ranking Democrat, said that "it's not possible, nor do we think it wise," to complete work on the two bills by next Friday.
The Finance Committee Democrats are an influential group. They worked closely with the Republicans on the budget and tax bills, and if they oppose the final product there will be no chance of bipartisan support for the measures.
Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, echoed his colleagues' concern, saying, "I'd rather do it well than do it fast."
At the White House, Michael D. McCurry, the press secretary, said the President would be patient.
"We're not going to accept a deal just because Congress is going on recess," he said. "We'll stick around and wait to get something that the President thinks is in the best interests of the American people."
Mr. McCurry said that if necessary, the President would postpone his three-week vacation on Martha's Vineyard, planned to begin on Aug. 18, to continue negotiating.

State officials acknowledged yesterday that they had tentatively recommended a winner in the yearlong competition to develop one of the most coveted pieces of Manhattan real estate -- Columbus Circle -- based less on architectural and aesthetic considerations than on financial grounds.
The officials had long maintained that they wanted buildings that would please the eyes and revive the neighborhood by replacing the dowdy New York Coliseum. But after settling on a design by Millennium Partners for an angular 64-story glass tower and connecting complex, the officials said they were most influenced by the willingness of the developer to pay for the site even if, as is very likely, the project is tied up in litigation before any ground is broken. 
 The officials said Millennium Partners had agreed to pay more than $300 million upon signing a contract for the property, lawsuits or no lawsuits. Developers generally withhold full payment until litigation is resolved, so the provision in the proposed deal with Millennium is highly unusual.
No other bidder said it would pay the full price in the face of litigation, officials involved in the selection process said.
The provision shows that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the state agency that owns the site, was so wounded by its last attempt to sell the Coliseum, a nine-year effort that collapsed in 1994 under the weight of several lawsuits, that it is eager to prevent it from happening again.
The provision "insures that this thing won't drag on for many years," said a senior state official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Officials said the aesthetics of Millennium's proposal helped its prospects, but were in the end of secondary importance. Some neighborhood groups have in fact praised the developer's design for a complex of 1.2 million square feet, which includes a convention center, a luxury hotel, condominiums, an entertainment center and a health club.
A coalition of three community boards in the area that ranked the nine original proposals for the site described the Millennium plan as among the best, though it said it had reservations about all the designs.
Millennium's lead architectural firm is James Stewart Polshek & Partners, which also designed the plan for the new planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History.
The Polshek design for the Coliseum site would create a glass presence on Columbus Circle with two towers, one 750 feet tall and the other 282 feet. A smaller glass structure framed in metal would curve along the circle and would connect the two buildings. Its roof would house a restaurant and other public spaces.
The visual focus of the design is the 750-foot tower, which has a triangular, sloping top and, while largely glass, is partly sheathed in stone toward the western side of the building.
Earlier in the consideration phase, neighborhood groups had complained that the transportation authority should have held an architectural competition.
The groups said the agency then should have chosen a design and given it to the developer that bid the highest for the site. Instead, the authority asked developers to submit plans that included designs, proposed uses and bids.
As a result, the critics say, the authority signaled more interest in financial considerations than in architectural values.
The authority did include architectural criteria in its request for bids, so many of the original proposals shared similar features.
All included at least one 750-foot tower, though the width, building material and style of the structures varied.
Some civic organizations and neighborhood groups said they disliked those proposals that included what they considered to be hulking towers, like the one designed by Robert A. M. Stern for the developer Donald J. Trump.
The transportation authority has not formally designated Millennium, and it appears that at least two development groups -- one a partnership of Bruce C. Ratner, Daniel Brodsky and Peter M. Lehrer, and the other a partnership of the Related Companies and Himmel & Company -- have a lesser chance of winning.
But both partnerships have refused to make the promise that Millennium did -- to pay for the site even if there is litigation.
Both partnerships' designs shared elements with the Millennium proposal.
The design by Cesar Pelli & Associates for the Ratner, Brodsky and Lehrer group calls for building two slim towers, one that would be 750 feet tall and another 540 feet tall, joined by a curved base that would include a Sears department store, a movie theater and an aquarium.
Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, architect for the Related Companies and Himmell & Company, proposed three towers, and instead of placing retail space on the ground floors, created an area for a 420,000-square-foot television studio.
Another proposal that is said to be in the running no longer -- Murphy/ Jahn's design for Tishman Speyer Properties -- called for two 750-foot towers, with a curved glass base similar to the Millennium design.
The news that the transportation authority has picked Millennium Partners angered the other two development teams still in the running, which protested to the authority yesterday that Millennium would not follow through with its promise to pay immediately despite litigation, state officials said.
Senior officials at the authority declined to comment, as did Christopher M. Jeffries, president of Millennium Partners.
The other two teams may now try to take their case to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who can veto the authority's choice or approve the deal.
At a news conference yesterday, he declined to say whether he would support the tentative selection of Millennium.
But he did stress that he wanted to insure that the project brought economic benefits to the neighborhood, particularly by linking the site to Lincoln Center, which is a few blocks to the northwest.
"What that means is," Mr. Giuliani said, "where do we have the best opportunity for economic development, which project aesthetically is going to be the most beautiful, and then of real importance, which project is going to allow us to tie it into the Lincoln Center community in a way that expands cultural capacity, artistic capacity, rather than having something that is aberrational."
Giuliani administration officials said that the administration liked the proposals from both Millennium and the Related Companies, though they had some problems with the one from Mr. Ratner and his partners because it included a Sears store, which the officials said might not be suitable for such a location.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
Yankees Take Out Insurance in Incaviglia

BYLINE: By JACK CURRY 

 BODY:
Saying that the asking prices for power hitters have been too expensive, the Yankees went the economical route last night by signing Pete Incaviglia to a minor league contract. Incaviglia, a 33-year-old right-handed outfielder, will report to the Class AAA Columbus Clippers today in Rochester, and Manager Joe Torre said he could be promoted to the Yankees by next week.
He is not Jose Canseco or even Mike Stanley, two players the Yankees have talked about acquiring, but they believe Incaviglia might be a decent weapon against left-handed pitchers. And Incaviglia's imminent arrival could enable the Yankees to release Mark Whiten. 
 Incaviglia, who went directly from college to the majors and has never played in the minors, has a .247 career average and 206 homers in 10 seasons. He was batting .246 with 5 homers and 12 runs batted in when the Baltimore Orioles released him on Tuesday.
"We're going to give him some time to knock the rust off because he hasn't played for three weeks," General Manager Bob Watson said.
Watson emphasized that the acquisition would not prevent the Yankees from continuing to pursue a more formidable power hitter. But Incaviglia offers the Yankees insurance at a cheap price. Because the Yankees must pay him at only a prorated version of the $150,000 minimum salary, he will cost them only about $50,000. The Orioles are paying the bulk of his $650,000 salary.
"This is by no means the answer," Watson said, noting that certain players are now injured. "The answer may be lying within our own organization anyway. We've got Bernie Williams coming back. We've got Tim Raines coming back. We've got favorable reports on Darryl Strawberry, and we might see him by mid-August. All those guys don't cost anything."
With next Thursday's trade deadline looming, the chances of the Yankees obtaining a more bona fide slugger to replace the injured Cecil Fielder are dwindling. The candidates have shrunk to four or fewer because Kansas City's general manager, Herk Robinson, said yesterday that he would not deal Chili Davis.
So the Yankees opted for Incaviglia, who has played for the Rangers, Tigers, Astros, Phillies and Orioles and was Hideki Irabu's teammate with the Chiba Lotte Marines in 1995.
"We don't absolutely have to make a deal," Watson said. "We'd like to make one. We don't absolutely have to."

HEADLINE: Robust Profits Continue, and Smaller Companies Join In

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

 BODY:
Three-fourths of the way through the second-quarter reporting season, corporate America is once again showing robust earnings.
And the winners are not just the big players. Even smaller companies are showing surprisingly strong earnings gains, creating the first signs of earnings parity since the first quarter of 1996. 
 While Wall Street analysts had been expecting a gain of about 8.9 percent from the companies that make up the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, operating profits are up about 11.5 percent from a year ago, according to I.B.E.S. International Inc. and First Call, two companies that monitor earnings reports.
Operating profits at smaller companies, such as those that constitute the Russell 2000 index, are doing even better, up about 17.5 percent from a year ago.
"This is the continuation of the powerful earnings drive that started with the first quarter of 1992," said Charles Hill, director of research at First Call in Boston. "It will be the 20th out of 22 quarters that we've seen double-digit gains in the S.& P. 500."
Such a long string of earnings gains has not been accomplished since the 1960's. But in recent weeks, anticipation of such dynamic profits has helped bolster an already buoyant stock market, one that has seen the S.& P. 500 soar 26.7 percent this year.
Indeed, of the 367 S.& P. 500 companies that have reported, 82 percent have matched or exceeded expectations, according to First Call, the same number that did so in the first quarter of the year. Since 1994, the average has been 72 percent.
Before the earnings reporting season began, however, there were some ominous signs. Warnings of profit slowdowns at companies like Intel and MCI Communications were compounded by jitters about rising wage pressures, the lack of pricing power at home and the strong dollar, which hampers sales abroad.
Those concerns caused many analysts to revise their estimates downward. But earnings have been impressive.
"A lot of the things you would be expecting at this point in the economic cycle, from pressure on margins to wage pressure, seem to be strangely absent," said Steven Leuthold, president of the Leuthold Group, a market research firm. "There's no sign yet of fading momentum. It's almost eerily good."
Among the best performers are consumer goods companies, like Kellogg, the cereal maker, with operating earnings up 62.2 percent, and the energy field, where operating earnings at Exxon, for example, rose 25.3 percent.
The technology sector has outperformed all others, with the average company up 34 percent from a year ago, according to I.B.E.S. Soaring earnings at Dell Computer, Lucent Technologies and Texas Instruments, among others, have helped push technology-laden indexes, like the Nasdaq composite, to record highs this summer.
And while the second-quarter S.& P. 500 gains are not as strong as those from the fourth quarter of 1996 (11.8 percent) or the first quarter of this year (15.1 percent), they have been solid, particularly because most of the profits were gained during a time when many thought the economy was moderating.
In the first quarter of this year, the nation's gross domestic product accelerated to an annual growth rate of 5.9 percent, creating fears of rising inflationary pressure. But many economists believe that second-quarter G.D.P. slowed to about 2 percent.
"The indications we have from company earnings suggest that business wasn't as bad as some of the G.D.P. estimates led us to believe," said Thomas McManus, an investment strategist at NatWest Securities. "More companies are doing well because they are continuing to focus on the cost line. And we're still seeing some portion of the earnings gain coming from the continuing adoption of technological innovation."
In other words, corporations are still finding ways to cut costs and increase productivity. Indeed, even blue-chip companies that reported only modest revenue gains in the second quarter found a way to show solid profit growth. Revenues at the Ford Motor Company were up about 3.3 percent, but operating income rose 43.4 percent from a year ago.
Still, there are those on Wall Street who expect earnings growth to continue to slow. For instance, Richard Bernstein, the director of quantitative research at Merrill Lynch, said that behind all the solid earnings this quarter were hints of moderation.
"If you look at the stories in the paper, you'd think we were at the beginning of a profit cycle," he said. "There are so many positive surprises. But even the positive surprises can't mask the fact that the profit cycle has resumed its deceleration."
Mr. Bernstein argues that corporations are managing their earnings better, often talking down analyst estimates. But companies that once saw a 20 or 30 percent gain are now seeing 10 or 15 percent. In the first quarter of 1995, for example, S.& P. 500 earnings rose 28 percent from a year earlier. This quarter, the gain is just over one-third of that.
Peter Jaquette, a senior economist at the WEFA Group, holds a similar view. "Profits, instead of growing 10 to 12 percent a year, are going to grow at 5 percent," he said. "This is much less than anyone is willing to mention publicly."
The reason, Mr. Jaquette said, is that corporate profits will not continue to grow at a faster pace than the economy partly because companies can no longer count on benefiting from declining interest rates, which make it less expensive to borrow money and pay off debts.
But Mr. Bernstein says a moderating economy has helped push down interest rates. And that interest rate decline has actually offset the slight slowdown in earnings. And strong earnings with low interest rates, or inflation, means that stocks are very attractive, at least for now.
"The positive impact of interest rates has offset the negative effect of slowing earnings," he said. "And remember, there are certain things that kill bull markets: one is inflation and the other is recession. And neither one is out there right now."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 29, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Saturday about recent quarterly earnings reports included the second-quarter results of the Kellogg Company erroneously. Kellogg plans to report its results on Friday; the reference to a 62.2 percent gain applied to an estimate from analysts surveyed by First Call.

 BODY:

Chief Justice
 A Biography of Earl Warren.
 By Ed Cray.
 Illustrated. 603 pp. New York:
 Simon & Schuster. $30. 
 I MET Earl Warren years ago, and recall him as tall, genial and authoritative. Ed Cray's "Chief Justice" shows that he was not as tall as I thought (only 6 feet 1 inch), that his relaxed geniality masked an explosive personality and that, while his dedication to principle never varied, his principles were variable.
Warren was for much of his career a political type not uncommon in 20th-century America -- the dedicated prosecutor and tireless foe of crime, vice and corruption, standing for disinterested professionalism and positioning himself above partisanship. He would move out of prosecution to become a liberal governor and an ultraliberal chief justice, but the persona and the approach would remain much the same.
Born in 1891, Warren grew up in Bakersfield, Calif., the son of a Southern Pacific Railroad repairman. His Scandinavian parents passed on to him the values, if not the devout faith, of working-class Protestantism. Young Earl stayed out of trouble, worked part time after school, full time in the summers, saved his money and went off to the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a law degree.
In 1925, after a number of public legal staff positions, Warren became District Attorney of Alameda County, where he combined dutiful Republican partisanship with an independent progressive appeal. A hard-line lawman, he rigorously enforced Prohibition and relentlessly pursued wrongdoing by prominent public officials.
Erratic at best on civil liberties, he would from time to time release grand jury transcripts to the press and authorize investigative wiretaps. He instituted surveillance on fringe groups of both the left and the right in the interest of protecting Americanism, and on two occasions he ordered the confiscation and burning of books that "allegedly defamed" William Randolph Hearst. He made few distinctions between labor thugs and the union leaders who could not be proved to have authorized their excesses. Temperamental, emotional and self-righteous, he presented an image of "biblical rectitude."
By 1938, Cray explains, Warren was the most visible local law enforcement official in the state, nationally known and patently ambitious. Having already led a successful drive to increase the power and authority of the state Attorney General, he won election to that office in 1938, taking advantage of the California cross-filing system to score victories in the Republican, Progressive and Democratic primaries.
As Attorney General, he took his crusade against criminality to the state level. He also clashed repeatedly with the liberal Democratic Governor, Culbert Olson, on a wide variety of matters, including judicial appointments that he deemed too libertarian. A vocal advocate of evacuating Japanese-Americans from the state after Pearl Harbor, he remarked that it was possible to evaluate the loyalty of an individual of "the Caucasian race," but "when we deal with the Japanese we are in an entirely different field." In 1942, he ran for governor and easily defeated Olson, whom he accused of softness toward the evacuees, criminals and Communists.
As the head of a largely Democratic state, Warren spent freely on education, highways and social services. His one major defeat was on a proposal for state health insurance. Benefiting from a nonpartisan image and a booming postwar economy, he took both the Democratic and the Republican primaries in his 1946 re-election bid, and in 1948 he was Thomas E. Dewey's Vice-Presidential running mate. (His political identity had become so ambiguous that President Harry Truman hailed him as virtually a Democrat in disguise.) In 1950, still widely popular in California, Warren rolled to a third term. Three years later, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed him Chief Justice of the United States.
By temperament an activist, Warren became a tribune of civil liberties and individual rights. He played a pivotal role in pulling the Supreme Court away from the judicial self-restraint that had been the reigning doctrine of liberals up till then. The Warren Court made racial desegregation the law of the land, mandated one-person-one-vote standards for most Federal and state elections, stretched the boundaries of free speech by redefining the laws of libel and obscenity, protected radicals and alleged subversives from harassment and prosecution, banned school prayer and restructured the criminal justice system in ways that worked to the advantage of the accused.
Cray, a professor of journalism at the University of Southern California, chronicles this judicial revolution admiringly, perhaps giving Warren a little too much credit for placing himself at the head of trends that were taking shape independently. What he does not do is question Warren's judicial activism. "The right thing, the fair thing determined the Chief's jurisprudence," he remarks. But earlier conservative judicial activists had struck down progressive-era and New Deal social legislation in the sincere belief that they were administering simple justice. Moreover, Warren himself, even at the zenith of his liberal phase, could be arbitrary, especially in obscenity cases.
Warren's most important intellectual antagonist, Felix Frankfurter, sensed that the courts risked their authority if they became the ultimate rulers in a democratic society, and he consistently argued that law had to be based on rules that transcended the good intentions of judges. Cray deals with Frankfurter, one of the century's pre-eminent legal thinkers, mainly as a conservative pedant, motivated by pettiness. Other critics of Warren -- including Hugo Black, Warren Burger and William Rehnquist -- fare no better.
The rest of the book is about as superficial. The author favors the three-sentence paragraph and the 12-page chapter. He relies much too heavily on oral history and personal interviews, often sources of faulty memory and hearsay. His writing is clear, but frequently careless. Every hundred pages or so, he reminds us that his subject had simple tastes, was a good husband and dutiful father, had a loyal staff and so on. But he gives us no explanation of a seething personality and a far-ranging ideological transformation.
Those readers in search of a competently told, undemanding, hagiographic story will like this book. Those who want a probing examination of a complex and important life will have to wait.

MEXICO
 Biography of Power: A History
 of Modern Mexico, 1810-1996.
 By Enrique Krauze.
 Translated by Hank Heifetz.
 Illustrated. 872 pp. New York:
 HarperCollins Publishers. $35. 
 Earlier this month, front pages across the United States ran photographs of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, the new Mayor-elect of Mexico City, abandoning his careworn opposition-leader demeanor for a giddy victor's smile. Mexico had just gone to the polls, with the spectacular result that come this December, for the first time in seven decades the country's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party will be forced to share power. No word describes this kind of change better than "historic." Yet I suspect that few Americans will appreciate what these elections mean for Mexico's future, because few of us have even the shallowest acquaintance with its past.
Why is this so? The usual American arrogance is one obvious answer. "Mexico: Biography of Power," Enrique Krauze's history of the country since 1810, the year it began to fight for independence from Spain, suggests another. The thesis of Krauze's amazingly ambitious study is that Mexico carried into the modern era a dual Aztec-Spanish colonial legacy -- a premodern attitude toward authority that has made it, historically speaking, something of a parallel universe. "Combining two traditions of absolute power," Krauze explains, "one emanating from the gods and the other from God -- this political mestizaje conferred a unique connection with the sacred on Mexico's succession of rulers."
Mexican presidents have enjoyed a bizarre job perk: an intoxicating but temporary omnipotence that disappears as soon as their term is up. And this top-heavy power structure hasn't been entirely destructive. With a few cataclysmic exceptions, the country has been stable, immune to the Latin American plague of revolving-door military dictatorships. More often than not since independence, it has even been, on paper, an advanced constitutional democracy. But Krauze believes that until recently Mexico's politics were hobbled by a morbid fixation on the past. A parade of strongmen claimed, sometimes quite sincerely, to be carrying out the legacy of the Aztecs, or a liberal 19th-century hero, or a martyr from the revolution (1910-17). And instead of encouraging open debate, they turned Mexican politics into a kind of theater, a distracting re-enactment of old, half-true legends.
So an honest account would begin by examining the lives of these strongmen, and where necessary adjusting their reputations. Krauze deals with the basic Mexican canon of heroes and villains here. The material will be familiar to people who follow Mexico, so much so that to them this book will feel something like the newly restored print of a classic film. Certain scenes have been trimmed or slightly expanded, and the lighting has been touched up; the tinkering is subtle, but the overall effect is profoundly different from what one remembers.
Krauze takes on such sacrosanct figures as Miguel Hidalgo, whose 1810 cry of "Death to the Spaniards!" evoked the suffering of the Aztecs and roused thousands of Indians to battle; in Krauze's view this patriot priest was actually a quixotic hedonist who unthinkingly whipped up ethnic hatred. Benito Juarez, a 19th-century liberal president who is one of the most worshiped men in modern Mexican history, fares better. Yet here, too, Krauze wants to clear away the distorting fog of myth. He stresses Juarez's youthful approval of a horrifying dictator. He even suggests parallels between Juarez and a traditionally reviled president, Porfirio Diaz, a ruthless economic modernizer who rescinded freedom of the press and held on to power from 1876 to 1910. Diaz has often been seen as Juarez's evil opposite, but according to Krauze, both were stoic, inflexible men who tended to hoard power.
What other insights emerge? Beginning with the Aztec emperor Cuauhtemoc, a frightening percentage of Mexico's heroes have been murdered in the prime of life; this unbroken cycle of martyrdom has polluted the country's political rhetoric with an "esthetic of death." As for the good guys, on the rare occasions when they've reached power they've had no clue what to do.
This is especially true of the man who comes closest to being Krauze's hero, Francisco Madero. A gentle, introspective advocate of individual liberty, Madero rose to prominence in 1909 when he wrote a book urging Mexicans to dump Porfirio Diaz and demand real democracy. The book became a best seller, and Madero improbably found himself leading an insurrection. But he was a moralist, not a politician. He was obsessed with notions of duty and self-sacrifice that he'd encountered in the Bhagavad-Gita; for political strategy, he relied on Ouija-board consultations with the spirit of his dead brother Raul. Given the opportunity to steer Mexico through a peaceful reform, he wobbled and failed to assert himself. Little more than a year after Madero was elected president, a breakaway general (backed by a meddling, sinister American ambassador) had him whisked away by night and shot.
Following Madero's assassination, Mexico dissolved in a factious revolution. Krauze gives us the entertaining lowdown on a decade's worth of rebels, traitors, military masterminds and suffering saints. (There's a funny but disturbing anecdote about Pancho Villa, so charismatic that Hollywood talent scouts offered him food and uniforms in exchange for the privilege of filming battles; the action director Raoul Walsh, who was then an actor playing the role of Villa in the fictional footage, said Villa was asked to schedule big shootouts at sunup for optimal lighting.) But Krauze is really interested in the way Mexico's leaders rebuilt the country by making questionable use of themes from its past.
The 1920's witnessed a disastrous persecution of Roman Catholics, which was justified in the name of an arid 19th-century vision of secular enlightenment, but which Krauze also traces, fascinatingly, to President Plutarco Elias Calles's personal rage at being born illegitimate. The end of the 1920's saw the planting of seeds that eventually grew into the Institutional Revolutionary Party, that contradictory behemoth, with its dozens of interests competing for the favor of a paternalistic president. This party began as a logical compromise. But more and more power accrued to the president, who could surround himself with cronies and do just about anything he wanted, from breaking a strike to running up a huge national debt, all in the name of revolution.
This book displays a curious mix of influences. Krauze often writes for The New Republic and other American publications, and his quick and clear style, his journalistic delight in quirks of personality and his occasional bad habit of schematic punditry (all deftly captured here in Hank Heifetz's careful translation) will feel familiar to American readers. But he also belongs to a milieu that is less well known here: the contentious, delightful, frustrating world of Mexican letters. Allegiances and antipathies tend to be more strongly defined among Mexican intellectuals than they are in the United States. Krauze pays careful homage to his mentors. His volcanic sense of Mexican history as a series of eruptions of the past in the present draws on the historical meditations of Octavio Paz. And his attack on the pharaonic powers of the modern presidency borrows from a brilliant, cantankerous essayist named Gabriel Zaid, who has compared the PRI in its heyday to vast corporations like General Motors. (It's typical of Mexico's eccentric intellectual scene that Zaid is also a poet and a business consultant; for that matter, Krauze trained as an industrial engineer.)
I POINT out this background because Krauze has buried some polemics in his study. He justly praises a right-wing party founded in 1939, the largely Catholic National Action Party -- not for its rigidly moralistic policy positions, but for its long, persevering commitment to democracy. As for the PRI's decline, he dates the beginning of the end to the truly evil moment in 1968 when President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz ordered troops to storm a peaceful demonstration in downtown Mexico City, and hundreds of students were murdered. Krauze was a student then; he recalls this thwarted movement with deep feeling. And like a man comparing each new woman he meets with an idealized first love, he criticizes much of the post-1968 Mexican left. He takes a swipe at Carlos Fuentes for an early friendship with Castro. He faults left-leaning Mexican intellectuals for clinging to a defensive, knee-jerk suspicion of the United States. He believes that Subcommander Marcos, the charismatic, articulate guerrilla leader who claims to speak for the dispossessed Indians of Chiapas, represents more of the same old Mexican histrionics.
Some of these criticisms are fair. But one wishes that Krauze would be less circuitous, even sneaky, about these polemics. In places, his opinions seem to be conveyed in a kind of petty code; with people he dislikes, like Marcos, he has mastered the American journalist's art of sounding perfectly evenhanded while damning his adversary with scant and selective quotation. His repeated insistence that Indians in Mexico face no significant racial discrimination seems exaggerated. So, too, does his emphasis on the events of 1968. The tragedies of that year did provoke the first real mass disillusionment with the PRI, yet it has taken three decades for the party fortress to show signs of crumbling. In the interim, Mexico has suffered crisis after crisis, from debt overload to assassinations to the yet-to-be-clarified sins of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Compared with his nuanced grasp of Mexican history, Krauze's treatment of these spectacular recent events feels perfunctory.
On the other hand, one wants to give Krauze the benefit of the doubt. Over and over again, he asserts his desire for Mexico to open itself up to debate. From the looks of this month's elections (not to mention a newly vital Mexican press that gets livelier by the day), such openness now seems inevitable, and there's every reason to believe that when the moment comes, Krauze will enter the fray with glee, freed from his need to even old scores.
Meanwhile, this shrewd and in many ways brave book is necessary reading. With luck it will help Americans appreciate that Mexico is more than an abstract policy dilemma -- a tag-along trade partner or a border to be patrolled. Mexico has a history, and it turns out to be just as rich and as puzzling and as freighted with utopian aspirations as our own.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT;
Cheap Las Vegas Rooms Are Harder to Find

BYLINE: By MIKE RICHARD 

 BODY:
PILOTS preparing for takeoff at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas have been known to use this joke in their greeting to passengers: "Ladies and gentlemen, we will be circling back over the Strip on our way out of town today, so feel free to look down and wave goodbye to your money."
Gamblers used to be able to withstand modest losses, mostly because hotel and food rates were so affordable. The $4.99 buffets, 99-cent one-pound hot dogs and 75-cent shrimp cocktails are still easy to swallow in Las Vegas. But visitors who enjoy the nickel-quarter slot machines and the $3- to $5-minimum table games -- not the high rollers who have their suites discounted or provided free -- are finding that bedding down in the city of neon is becoming a more expensive proposition. 
 A check in late June at some of the better-known hotels on Las Vegas Boulevard, known as the Strip, showed an increase in the cost of the most economical standard midweek accommodations.
When the Mirage opened in November 1989, rooms could be had for $49 to $59 a night when checking in on Sunday through Thursday. As the hotel -- with its exploding volcano, art collection in the lobby, manicured tropical pool area, dolphin habitat and white tigers on display (part of the Siegfried & Roy magic show) -- garnered high ratings in national travel guides, its rates rose. A midweek stay at the 3,000-plus-room resort this month could cost $99 a night, while for late October, the price quoted by a reservation clerk was $149. "Rates can fluctuate dramatically here," said Alan Feldman, a Mirage spokesman, talking about Las Vegas in general. "It's demand. That's the easiest way to explain it."
Other Strip hotels have also raised their rates. At the Monte Carlo, a hotel toward the southern end of the Strip that opened in June 1996 and advertises its "European style, Las Vegas wild" mix of accents, the same room that cost $59 during an October 1996 midweek visit costs $89 in October 1997.
While Las Vegas travelers are accustomed to paying more for a hotel on Friday and Saturday night, when the city is jammed with people from nearby Arizona and Southern California, the surge in midweek rates is something of a jolt.
Mr. Feldman said capacity, conventions and holidays can be contributing factors in a hotel's pricing structure, adding that Las Vegas is different from other major American tourist destinations because gaming revenue is part of the economic formula.
"In May of this year," he said, talking about a shopping-center convention that took place at the Mirage, "rates changed from $139 to $89 to $59 to $199 -- all in one week."
The conventioneers, with their group advance booking, got first crack at the lower rates, and as the occupancy numbers for that week went up and down at the frequently sold-out Mirage, prices for other guests were determined. One reservation clerk likened pricing formulas for Las Vegas hotels to the airlines' economic rules -- that is, the rates tend to drop if capacity is gauged to be weak.
Because of the price fluctuation, it often comes down to when a Las Vegas trip planner calls a hotel. For example, at Treasure Island, the Mirage's sister hotel known for its pirate-ship motif, a call in early May found the best price for an October midweek stay to be $89. A call in late June requesting the same accommodations on the same dates got a rate quote of $49.
Myram Borders, news bureau chief for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, cited figures from a survey completed by her agency in January that showed a slight rate increase for accommodations from 1995 to 1996. She said the survey took into account all of the city's 101,100 hotel and motel rooms, including establishments without casinos.
"Our statistics show the average nightly room rate was $58 for 1996, compared to $54 for 1995," she said.
Finding rooms for under $60 a night may now be a long shot at the posh hotels along the Strip, but in downtown Las Vegas, about two miles north, hotel prices have remained constant and, for the most part, inexpensive. The Four Queens ($59) and the Lady Luck ($43), two glitzy lodging staples downtown, offered economical prices for the late-October midweek stay. This Casino Center section has recently been spruced up to compete with new attractions on the Strip.
Hotel managers and tourism officials said that while the city's hotels might be slightly more expensive than in the past, Las Vegas -- with its burgeoning family-friendly attractions, indoor and outdoor entertainment, hot-but-dry weather and affordable dining -- is still a bargain compared with other popular United States cities such as San Francisco, New York and Orlando, Fla.
Mr. Feldman, who estimated that 30 million tourists visited Las Vegas last year, offered this advice: "Shop around and be flexible. If you can be flexible, you can save lots of money. You have to arrive on certain days and on certain weeks. Conventions in town play a big role in prices."

HEADLINE: DANCE VIEW;
Why They Don't Dance Much in American Films

BYLINE: By Jennifer Dunning 

 BODY:
A ROW OF TROUSERED LEGS stretches across the screen. Waiting patiently, they move very little except to shuffle a step or two forward on the unemployment line. Suddenly the droning Muzak shifts to a disco beat. One leg kicks out a little and then another, almost unconsciously. The camera pans across the men to catch one, paunchy and no longer young, slipping into a modest but confidently executed turn. Dance, it seems, can spill into the dimmest corners of everyday life.
That moment is from "The Full Monty," one of three new films in which dance transforms a variety of humdrum or difficult lives. The movie, which opens in New York on Aug. 15, tells the story of a group of laid-off steelworkers in northern England who form a Chippendale-style kick-and-strip line. In "Alive and Kicking," which opened Friday, a young modern dancer with AIDS is kept alive by his will to move. And in the recent "Shall We Dance?," a middle-aged Japanese businessman with a graying soul falls in love with a beautiful but remote young ballroom dancing teacher and is drawn inexorably into an exotic world that is forbidden territory in circumspect Japan. 
 It is unsurprising that none of the films was made in the United States. Dance has played a part in American films only fitfully since the last great movie musicals in the 1950's. Dance seldom even figures as subject matter despite its potential for the kind of visual excitement that film alone can capture. And the movie dance numbers that once expressed emotions too joyous to be put into words have now gone the way of plots about the kind of uncomplicated romance that prompted most of that joy.
"So many of today's films stress the terrors that await us," Michael Kidd, the winner of a special Academy Award for career achievement this year, said in his acceptance speech. "Perhaps this award signifies an awareness that we have been missing something, namely the vitality and joy in living that movie musicals can express in song and dance."
There are no traditional dance numbers in "The Full Monty," "Alive and Kicking" or "Shall We Dance?," and certainly none of the films is remotely related to the American movie musical. But the art form that is regularly enlisted to sell everything from the songs at the heart of music videos to the nacho chips gobbled down by the chubby little strutter in television ads for Doritos, is used similarly in these three films to express and evoke powerful, liberating emotions.
" 'Shall We Dance?' epitomizes a society of repressed emotion, and I think that to a large degree exists in our society too," said Mr. Kidd, a choreographer and director of Broadway and film musicals that include "The Band Wagon" and "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers." "Ordinarily we don't release our emotions easily. That's why we can empathize with the dance, with that exuberance."
The lives depicted in "Shall We Dance?," "The Full Monty" and "Alive and Kicking" are specific and probably, for most viewers, somewhat foreign. But there is a vicarious pleasure to seeing Mr. Sugiyama, the quiet dignified hero of "Shall We Dance?," move from ramrod stiffness and pathetic hesitancy to the point where he can sweep across a ballroom with the young teacher Mai. The wildly exuberant antics of a rock-and-roll dancer at the school, revealed eventually as his nervous fellow employee Mr. Aoki in disguise, are similarly exciting.
The men in "The Full Monty" are seen rehearsing and performing for only a few brief moments, but there is a tonic familiarity to their endearingly comic struggles to overcome their embarrassment about looks and grizzled age, their uncomfortableness about female-seeming preening, and their fear of letting go in a world that has already made sport of them. And who, facing debility or simple exhaustion, has not had the experience of finding within oneself some unsuspected brute energy for survival, as Tonio does in the British film "Alive and Kicking"?
Dance is a sensual, demanding mistress. The mates of several of these unlikely dancers become jealous. "Alive and Kicking" may paint an unlikely picture of a modern dance company but there is nothing unbelievable about the explosion of rage by Tonio's lover, Jack, a hard-drinking psychotherapist desperately fighting to continue his work with AIDS patients as funds dwindle, as Tonio talks endlessly of rehearsals for a forthcoming production.
Mr. Sugiyama's pretty young wife is convinced that her husband, suddenly absent from home for his secret ballroom lessons, is cheating on her with another woman. In "The Full Monty," David's humiliation at his failure to find a job has made him impotent. His frustration turns to mute horror when his working wife lashes out at him after finding his stripper's bikini and assuming he has been having sex with some other woman.
None of these men are the sort of characters that movie musicals featured. True, as Mr. Kidd points out, the earliest musical scripts were built around the "Cinderella" plot. "If you go back to the original, what could be bleaker?" Mr. Kidd asks, referring to the innumerable wide-eyed chorines who were the heroines of those musicals. "Go out a chorus girl, come back a star. Somehow they marry a prince, though in different guises." But Fred Astaire and Gene Kelly followed.
"Astaire wasn't a real person," Mr. Kidd says. "He was strictly a musical comedy creation. You never thought of him as the guy filling your tank at your local gas station. Which Gene Kelly was, and that contributed to the tremendous popularity of musicals. The big, enormous contribution that Gene Kelly made was making the hero a 'regular joe.' "
Mr. Sugiyama, Tonio and even Gaz, the scrappy little instigator of the "Full Monty" line, live in a much darker world than the often humdrum but basically optimistic one inhabited by Kelly's men. In his films, dance was frequently a reflection of the inherent joy of life as much as its expression. Here, dance movement is one of the very few ways that joy can be realized and find an outlet.
Today, Mr. Kidd suggests, film choreography is largely a matter of the plotting of moves in action films. "It is the same meticulous choreographic planning we used to apply to musical numbers," he says. The stylized world of the movie musical has been supplanted by that of the action film. And movie musicals, an expensive genre to start, are not likely to be made again until a musical makes more money than the disappointing box-office returns for films like "Evita" and "A Chorus Line."
But love, hope and liberating joy can still push up through the sere ground of 1990's lives. One moment in "The Full Monty" communicates that best, when Gaz persuades David to return to rehearsals. It is hard and time-consuming work at first. David has found a job, which, though meager and dispiriting, is still a job. But at last he pulls away, dashing through the door of the chill, huge superstore in which he is working as a security guard.
Out he races into the parking lot, tearing after the speeding Gaz in one wild burst of running jumps. He will dance with his friends, a petty functionary turned star for a few mad minutes. There will be no work to return to. But after this, one surmises, there may even be a prince of a job on a suddenly expansive horizon.

HEADLINE: The View From: Elizabeth Park;
A Many-Hued Offset to the Concrete Acres of Hartford

BYLINE: By PEGGY McCARTHY 

 BODY:
THE sweat slid off Hugh Greer's face under an oppressive summer sun, but the 70-year-old man continued to bend over and pull weeds from the Medallion rose beds. Mr. Greer is a volunteer who works in Elizabeth Park in Hartford most weekdays because, he says, he wants future generations to enjoy the park he "kind of grew up in."
Elizabeth Park, 100 years old this year and on the National Register of Historic Places, is a haven where memories are made and life's milestones are recorded in photos and videotapes. In June and July, about 18 wedding parties each weekend pose for photographs there, said Donna J. Fuss, the park rosarian. 
 The park is said to have the oldest municipal rose garden in the country. In 1912, the All America Rose Selection tested roses there. And in 1990 the garden, with its arches, gazebo, and rose beds, was named the most outstanding of the 130 designated All America Rose Selection gardens in the country. There are 15,000 rose bushes in Elizabeth Park, along with perennials, annuals and rock and tulip gardens. It is listed in the Garden Archives of the Smithsonian Institution.
Since Hartford is a city where resources are stretched to meet needs like education and human services, the city relies on a group called Friends of Elizabeth Park to raise money, recruit volunteers and coordinate refurbishing projects. The city employs seven people who do everything from cleaning bathrooms to mowing the lawn's bowling greens, Ms. Fuss said.
"We all call it the jewel of the city," said Ms. Fuss, whose job is to consult on the care and purchase of roses, and to conduct tours and workshops.
The 102-acre park, with its formal gardens, greenhouses, pond and shade trees, is an escape from the concrete and traffic noise of the city. It is also a tourist attraction.
The park's history is as colorful as its roses and its existence has sometimes been fragile. Charles N. Pond, a New Haven Railroad tycoon, state treasurer and banker, willed the land to the city after prodding from the Rev. Francis Goodwin, then a Hartford park commissioner.
Mr. Pond is described as an alcoholic who often disturbed his neighbors by using his living room fireplace and backyard as a shooting gallery. He had planned that after his death his home would be turned into a refuge for alcoholics. But Mr. Goodwin, it is said, persuaded him to make a bequest of a garden park in memory of his wife, Elizabeth. Their home was torn down, but a building now being renovated for a restaurant is called the Pond House.
Over the years people used the park to picnic, sled, play sports and generally escape life's stresses.
In the 1970's, however, the city faced serious financial troubles and the rose gardens deteriorated, prompting city leaders to plan to pave them over. The gardens were saved by the establishment in 1977 of the Friends of Elizabeth Park. The organization provides trees, roses, bulbs, seeds, shrubs, supplies and equipment, and has undertaken major projects including the renovation of the Pond House. It is now planning a renovation of the park's three greenhouses.
In 1987 the group hired Ms. Fuss to be its rosarian.
On a recent afternoon, about 30 people joined a tour led by Ms. Fuss, who always wears dresses and skirts with rose designs on them, as well as earrings shaped like roses. Questions came from both knowledgeable and fledgling gardeners, stops were frequent to admire the scents and the hues -- pinks, purples, yellows and whites. Tourists with cameras wandered in search of the perfect layout.
Residents of nursing homes and the American School for the Deaf are among regular visitors to the park, as are workers taking lunch breaks and families grilling picnic dinners and tossing Frisbees.
"They come to shed the stresses of life," said the park's foreman, Paul Condon.
Maryanne Gryboski, a massage therapist from Easton, spends lunch hours in the park on the three days a week she works in Hartford. She said she enjoys the perennials, and she always checks the bed of Buckroses her family donated three years ago in memory of her parents, Albert and Mary Gryboski, who lived in New Britain and often visited the park.
Mr. Condon called the park an "urban arboretum," saying it is "all a garden to me." And he listed amenities other than flowers and trees: Nine tennis courts, one regulation Little League field, two softball fields, a picnic grove with grills and two lawn bowling greens. (The father of the volunteer, Mr. Greer, was president of the park's Lawn Bowling Association in 1924.)
The tennis courts are used yearround with participants pitching in to sweep the courts after rain. Only snow keeps the diehard players away, said Robert Petrunti, of West Hartford, one of the retirees who is a regular there. The players are retirees, teen-agers, people who are unemployed, and those who play after they get out out of work. Florence H. Filhoff, of West Hartford, said she has been playing there at least five days a week for 25 years. "This is absolutely a melting pot," she said.
Everyone who stops by the park seems to have memories connected to it, said Ms. Fuss. Her own go back to when she was pushed in a stroller by her parents. She fed ducks and learned to ice skate there, she said. As a teen-ager, she and her future husband went to concerts in the park.
Mr. Condon, who said the park was a popular sledding spot for him and his boyhood friends, said the first thing that ever attacked him was a goose from the park's pond. Mary Turner moved to Hartford seven years ago and quickly became a volunteer, working
"In the city, there is so much concrete. This is such a beautiful place to come. I want to keep it going, pass it on," Mrs. Turner said.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
In Italian Tradition, Classics Revitalized

BYLINE: By JOANNE STARKEY 

 BODY:
LA VIGNA has come full circle. This Greenvale veteran was part of a wave of northern Italian restaurants that swept across the North Shore more than 20 years ago. They were elegant and expensive and served the Italian-French food blend called Continental.
As times and tastes changed, so did La Vigna. Around 1990, it introduced an all-Italian menu that featured grilled and lighter fare. A year later it moved to family dining, that inflation fighter with lower prices and large platter- filling portions. 
 Today, La Vigna is much as it was 20 years ago: a traditional spot serving classic food. Spinach salad is still tossed at tableside by the captain and that old standard, roast duckling in orange sauce, is on the menu.
But La Vigna is not a tired leftover. Much of the food (especially the pastas) is exciting and the dining room has been revitalized.
Gone are the elaborate chandeliers and the formal look of yesterday, replaced by fabric-draped, modern lighting and rustic touches like brick trim, stucco ceiling and decorative strings of garlic and red peppers. Yet, the dining room is still elegant. The tables are well-spaced, the seating plush and comfortable, the noise-level conducive to conversation.
There have been changes in the kitchen as well. Last year, Gary Lanza, a Culinary Institute of America graduate who has worked at Le Bernardin in Manhattan, took over the restaurant from his father. He, along with the new executive chef, Paco Ortez, make all the restaurant's desserts, bread, pastas, sauces and mozzarella. They even cure their own prosciutto.
The made-daily, chewy rolls are noteworthy but it is the pastas that steal the show. Homemade saffron spaghetti, tossed with shrimp, asparagus, tomatoes, olive oil and lots of garlic, is a memory maker. So, too, is another unusual dish: flower-shaped pasta in a black, aged, finely minced, wild mushroom sauce. Very light gnocchi in a filet mignon sauce ignited by peppercorns keeps the winning streak going.
But other menu offerings are less consistent. A chopped salad, one evening, had no taste. Much better were the warm spinach salad (created with fanfare) and the classic Caesar. Best was the sprightly Sicilian salad that featured paper-thin slices of fennel tossed with arugula and fresh orange segments.
An impressive plate of grilled vegetables and a spirited seafood salad led the appetizers. But clams in olive oil, garlic and white wine were chewy and the broth forgetable. A special of portobello mushrooms and artichoke hearts, described as bathed in olive oil, garlic and rosemary, arrived in a dark-brown, heavy gravy. This is quite a shock for diners expecting a light vegetable opener.
A few of the entrees were marred by lack of seasoning. Two specials -- chicken breasts in Champagne sauce with asparagus and sole crowned with shrimp -- both needed a hefty addition of salt to bring them to life. Much better were tasty veal rolls filled with spinach and cheese in a rich wine sauce and moist swordfish with an olive oil, garlic and herb topping.
The prime pick from the menu is the velvety filet mignon in a creamy, brandy sauce dotted with green peppercorns. Also passing muster are the tender scaloppine piccata and chicken cutlets under a blanket of chopped salad.
Service varies. On a quiet weeknight, there were few slip-ups. But on Saturday, wine arrived without glasses, the bread basket was replaced sans additional butter and dishes were delivered auction style.
Gratis bruschetta, pizza pinwheels and an intermezzo of tangy lemon sorbet make an appearance on weeknights. On Saturday, the serving of bruschetta was hit and miss. Some tables received it; others did not.
The homemade desserts here are better than the usual Italian sweets. Best are the creamy tiramisu, the light Napoleon and the raspberry tart. The cassata cake was different on two tries: light with an airy chocolate mousse filling one time, heavy with the addition of cannoli cream another.
Although La Vigna's largely Italian and American wine list of more than 50 choices contains four or five selections that cost under $20, the average bottle is on the pricey side. (More are over $30 than under it.) A soft, jammy 1994 Caboche Chateauneuf du Pape ($31) is a medium-bodied red suitable for drinking now, while a $19 Mill Creek sauvignon blanc 1993 is a solid, subtle alternative to California chardonnays.

HEADLINE: Proposing New Goals for Workfare

BYLINE: By JOHN RANDAZZO 

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS

 BODY:
TEAMS of Westchester County welfare reformers and their New York City counterparts met here recentlyto consider new goals for workfare programs, which have saved both areas more than $100 million, Mary E. Glass, the county's Commissioner of Social Services, said.
On the table for discussion are topics ranging from obtaining minimum wages for people in the workfare programs to teaching them more marketable skills like car repair, plumbing and electrical work. The county started the workfare program in 1989. It requires able-bodied home-relief recipients to spend 20 hours a week in workfare, or as it is known, Pride in Work public improvement projects, to retain their subsistence eligibility. 
 Under state law, home-relief enrollees can be ordered to help county, city, town and nonprofit organizations perform clerical, maintenance, security, painting, repair and debris removal jobs, among others. About 750 people are signed into the current workfare program.
The home-relief case load, Ms. Glass said, is "currently at its lowest in 10 years and the lower the better." Meetings with the social services staff of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York City would make it even better, she said.
Mayor Giuliani, along with Gov. George E. Pataki, put workfare formulas into effect about three years ago. Both have said that it saves a lot of money..
County Executive Andrew P. O'Rourke started the county's operation in 1989 as an important approach to reforming welfare. He has called it an "unqualified success."
A 48-member investigative staff of the Department of the Social Services helps. A budget of more than $2 million for workfare combats fraud by weeding out ineligible applicants, no-shows, deadbeats who hold off-the-book jobs, enrollees who ignore interview appointments and absentees without satisfactory explanations.
A report from Commissioner Glass's office shows that 21,773 were removed from the rolls beginning in 1989 with 60 percent of them not returning. It vexes officials because they do not know why they do not get back on welfare. Almost 10,000 home-relief recipients have been involved in nine years of public improvement.
The report indicates that total work hours provided to municipalities and nonprofit agencies have plunged. In 1994, 511,350 hours were logged; last year, the total sagged to 440,870 hours and will be even lower this year.
In 1989 approximately 116,000 hours of work by home-relief recipients were approved for the communities.
The social services budget of $413.5 million for 1997 allots $339 millionfor all relief, including Aid to Dependent Children, Medicaid and food stamps, with 32.7 million of it allocated for home relief. Those in favor of workfare programs cite improved municipal buildings, garages, graffiti removal, roadway improvements and help to nonprofit groups in White Plains, Yonkers, Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and 17 towns and cities.
Mr. O'Rourke in a previous interview has said: "County and local agencies ask for help because neither has the time nor the funding to undertake expensive projects like these. The able-bodied gain work experience and self-respect and improved work habits and work ethic."
At the same time, he said, people unable to work because of drug or alcohol abuse, psychiatric and other ills are scheduled for treatment. The permanently unemployable are given disability reviews for continued subsistence payments, Mr. O'Rourke added.
Even as Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Pataki were expanding workfare operations, Westchester's declining home-relief case load puzzles Dennis Packard, Deputy Commissioner of Social Services.
"People just drop in and out of the subsistence" safety net, Mr. Packard said. "There must be a hidden economy out there because we don't know where they go." Public assistance payments average about $400 a month per person, he said.
A combination of factors is driving down welfare rolls, experts say. These include an exceptionally healthy economy's job market; double-dippers on the run and a perception that welfare handouts get no respect while paying jobs do.
Workfare meetings under way here are a continuation of a strategy to sharpen workfare. Commissioner Glass has visited New York City frequently to see how its program works.
Workfare has had its detractors. Union leaders have charged that jobs will be taken from union members, a fear that has failed to materialize. Some say, Demand minimum pay for workfare people, and the Clinton Administration recently said that workfare people should get minimum pay.
Other groups condemn the program because they say it teaches few marketable skills.
Commissioner Glass said study programs at Westchester Community College that teach jobs like auto repair, carpentry, plumbing and such did not work out, explaining that a transient population is difficult to invest in for marketable skills. Of the 16 people who underwent training for the jobs at the college, only one, a woman completed it.
Many people train themselves. Herbert Thomas Payne, 33, who said he is a recovering drug addict, lives with 61 other homeless men at the nonprofit Westhab Employment Residence on Tarrytown Road here.
In January Mr. Payne joined workfare. "I give my 20 hours a week," he said, "then I go to school weekends to learn plumbing and electrical work."
Orlando Davy of Mount Vernon, who lost his job at a Wall Street brokerage house, linked up with workfare, which led to a Civil Service examination for a receptionist with the Social Services Department.
He got the job and now earns $24,500 a year. Mr. Davy seeks broader horizons now and would like a job as an eligibility examiner, at $33,815 a year. "I'd like to advance within the department," Mr. Davy said.

HEADLINE: JERSEY;
Long Hours. Low Pay. Must Like Travel.

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY 

 BODY:
DOWN near the tip of the Jersey shore, a young woman more accustomed to the dappled greens and pastel blues of summer at home in rural Ireland blinked into the blistering lights of the Wildwood boardwalk and tried to describe her initial impressions of America.
Those impressions thus far had consisted of Kennedy International Airport and a van ride on the Jersey Turnpike and Garden State Parkway that ended at a blazing spectacle of amusement piers hoisted on pilings over a beach that takes a quarter-mile to get to the ocean. So it was a little like asking Dorothy what she thought of Oz shortly after the house dropped and the screen went to Technicolor. Wonder and awe are reasonable responses. But a smart girl from the country also spots the pasteboard beneath the glitter and watches for unpleasant surprises down the road. 
 "It's actually unlike anything I've ever seen," Mary McCormack, 20 years old, said with amiable diplomacy from behind the counter of an ice-cream and soda stand on Morey's Pier. Behind her rose the backlit herring-boned hulk of a monster new wooden roller coaster, radiating shrieks as its cars plunged down the 100-foot drop.
This summer, Miss McCormack and three girlfriends from college in Ireland came to the United States to take summer jobs in Wildwood, where the Morey Organization, which operates the three amusement piers and other boardwalk attractions, has been hiring Irish and British kids for many years to supplement its local summer work force.
What was the most remarkable initial impression?
"Well, the way Americans eat," she said, laughing after a moment's hesitation. "Every waking hour, they're eating something else." As if on cue, a fat man in droopy shorts waddled into sight stacking French fries into his mouth, one after another, from a cardboard bucket big enough to haul coal. A woman approached the counter nibbling daintily at the apex of a pizza slice. Some kids thumped by slurping ice cream.
Her second notable impression reflects the global pandemic of American television. One night shortly after settling into a Wildwood boarding house, the Irish women heard a loud argument on the street outside. Figuring a shootout would follow, "we all four got into one bed and slept with a kitchen knife under the sheet," she said.
Miss McCormack and her friends are among several thousand foreign college students recruited for summer jobs by American amusement parks, hotels and restaurants under student-exchange programs that allow them to work here from June through mid-October. In Wildwood, which is one of the leading American employers of foreign students for summer jobs, Irish and British young men and woman have traditionally predominated. But that is changing as more summer jobs open up in the voracious American leisure industry and more foreign students learn about the demand.
"These days, with so many American companies competing with us, we're getting kids from Latvia, Belarus -- places that send me to the atlas. Last year, we had a third-year Hungarian medical student working for us -- for $5.05 an hour," said Trina McSorley, the human resources director for Morey, which has 450 foreign students among its summer work force of 1,500.
Boardwalk employers in Seaside Heights, Point Pleasant, Atlantic City and Ocean City also hire foreign students. There are several reasons for the need to go abroad: Unemployment is low. And most Jersey seashore areas are surrounded by older, affluent populations with few teen-agers -- or, as in the case of Wildwood, are far from any population center.
Many foreign college students jump at the chance to come to America and work long hours at what Jack Morey, vice president of the family-run amusement business, frankly describes as "basically low-paid jobs at the beach." Part of the allure is that after the summer season ends, the students still have a month to travel in the United States.
This year, as the Fourth of July weekend approached, the Morey company was still about 100 workers short. So, like a modern incarnation of the employment agents who worked the East River piers in the 19th century, trolling for immigrant laborers to stoke the furnaces of the Industrial Revolution, Mrs. McSorley traveled to Kennedy airport in New York. Competing with agents from other major American amusement parks, and several casinos, she met flights from Europe, touting students on a summer in Wildwood. Finally, she filled her quota.
"It's become pretty competitive," she said. "I used to be pretty open about sharing information about where we get our students. Not anymore."

HEADLINE: Torrington Twisters Get Warm Embrace

BYLINE: By DON HARRISON 

 BODY:
THE man who collects the tickets at the ballpark in Torrington is older than it is, which speaks volumes about the durability of Joseph (Lefty) Silano.
The park was donated to the city in 1918 by Frederick Fuessenich in memory of his wife, Elizabeth Blake Fuessenich. Silano had arrived on this planet on Dec. 2, 1914. 
 His passion for baseball, which he played with considerable skill in distant yesterdays at Fuessenich and elsewhere, remains unabated. He was an outfielder capable of hitting .400 in the old semi-pro Connecticut State League and, much later, an umpire for 25 summers. In the early 1950's Silano played in an exhibition game at Fuessenich against a major league all-star team that included Phil Rizzuto, Mickey Vernon and Johnny Pesky.
On a recent warm afternoon, the old outfielder and umpire was collecting the usual $2 donations from a cluster of fans. He smiled or nodded as they walked toward seats in the grandstand built into the side of what was once known as Bishops Hill. Inside, the visiting Middletown Giants were preparing for their New England Collegiate Baseball League game against the Torrington Twisters.
"This is good collegiate ball; some of these kids will get signed up for the minor leagues," Silano said. "It's really shook up the town."
Silano is vice president of the Twisters and the eldest member of the 20-person board of directors. The group, with support from Mayor Mary Jane Gryniuk and other civic leaders, made the franchise a reality within the space of three months last winter.
Torrington is the newest member of the N.E.C.B.L., a four-year-old, six-team summer league sanctioned by the N.C.A.A. and Major League Baseball. The city, in the northwest corner of the state, has embraced the Twisters with open arms and open wallets.
The Rotary Club purchased uniforms; the daily newspaper, The Register-Citizen, donated warmup jackets. A radio station, WAPJ-FM, is broadcasting most games, home and away. During the Memorial Day parade, the Twisters were a uniformed presence aboard a float.
Like its more-established counterpart, the Cape Cod League, N.E.C.B.L. has rosters filled with players drawn from colleges across the country, nearly all of whom see themselves as "pro prospects," and many of them actually are. Eleven members of the Twisters, for example, were selected in the Major League draft, either in high school or college.
Prospects may be found, perhaps in less abundance, on the league's other teams: Middletown Giants, Danbury Westerners and Eastern Tides of Willimantic in Connecticut, the Rhode Island Reds and the Central Massachusetts Collegians.
On a typical game day, three or four professional scouts -- equipped with speed guns and cynical looks -- are apt to be found at Fuessenich. They're there to study athletes playing under actual professional conditions: using wooden bats. Professional teams have become reluctant to assess talent strictly on the basis of intercollegiate or high school competition, where aluminum bats are the staple.
"They were drafting guys who couldn't hit a lick with a wooden bat," said Gregg Hunt, a business teacher at the Gilbert School in Winsted and the Twisters head coach. "With wood, you have to know where the bat head is all the time and you've got to hit a lot more with your head."
Hunt considers himself fortunate to have a lineup of players who realize the importance of bat location: Justin Sherrod, a shortstop with six home runs and a .318 batting average; Dave Benham, the catcher from Texas whose six home runs have helped generate 26 runs batted in, and Jim Deschaine, a 19-year-old native of Bristol, batting .420 as the regular second baseman. Torrington leads the league with a 20-11 record.
The Twisters are also first in attendance, averaging nearly 800 people per game at refurbished Fuessenich Park. The opening game, on May 31 against Danbury, attracted a crowd of 3,320.
"Traffic was backed up for two miles in the third inning," recalled Kirk Fredriksson, the Twisters' 32-year-old general manager.
Fredriksson, a former semi-pro player who earns his livelihood as general manager of the Sherman I.G.A. supermarket, is responsible for the team's day-to-day operations. In April he helped organize a fund-raising event, a $20-a-plate celebrity breakfast that attracted 250 people and featured Fay Vincent Jr., the former Major League Baseball commissioner, as speaker.
On the baseball side, Fredriksson did his recruiting homework, even going to Florida during the spring to sign Sherrod and two other players from Rollins College.
He didn't have to look far to find Ben Power, an outfielder-first baseman, and Scott Barnsby, a pitcher. Both are Torrington residents and Power is the son of the team president. By conservative estimate, Fredriksson devoted an average of 30 to 40 hours a week to the Twisters during the formative months and perhaps 20 to 30 hours a week now. "I'm a volunteer general manager and I love it," he said. "I wanted to bring baseball back to the community level." Patrick Power, a lawyer who serves as team president, is clear in his admiration for Fredriksson's efforts: "Kirk is 95 percent responsible for the Twisters' success."
On a warm Sunday afternoon, the game was all that a baseball purist could ask for.
Both starting pitchers, Mike Galati of Middletown and Ryan Kearney of Torrington, were exceedingly sharp; neither allowed a run through seven innings. Deschaine, the Twisters' second-baseman, provided defensive support with a back-to-the-plate catch of a Texas Leaguer and a catch of a line drive that he transformed into a double play.
Kearney, a junior and collegiate all-star at the University of Massachusetts in Lowell, had hoped to be drafted, especially after pitching in the Cape Cod League the previous summer.
"It was kind of a disappointment," said the pitcher, who leads the N.E.C.B.L. with a 0.79 earned run average. "In this league, we don't have as many big-name players as the Cape, but the competition is just as stiff."
To earn spending money, Kearney, like some of his teammates, works part-time -- in his case, in a Torrington sporting goods store.
In the bottom half of the eighth inning, the deadlock was broken by Deschaine, who walloped a Galati pitch over the left field wall for his first N.E.C.B.L. home run..
Greg Jeffries, a junior from Queens College, replaced Kearney in the ninth inning and preserved the shutout by striking out two of the four Giants he faced.
Deschaine is the son of a former athlete in Waterbury and the nephew of a man who was an outstanding basketball guard at Gonzaga University; despite his athletic genes he wasn't in the Twisters' lineup at the season's beginning. "Jim didn't figure into our plans as an everyday player at first," Hunt said, but he's made himself into a starter. He's earned it."
For Torrington it is just the beginning. Next year, the restoration of Fuessenich Park will continue with a rebuilt grandstand, new restrooms, concession stands and press box. The project carries a $550,000 price tag, nearly half of which will come from the state, but the Mayor said she believes it's worth it.
"Baseball is an economic draw for Torrington. We draw from all the surrounding towns," said Gryniuk, who is enough of a Twisters fan to throw a party for the team at her home. "Torrington is a big sports town, always has been and always will be."

HEADLINE: Water Wars Along the Shepaug River

BYLINE: By FRANCES CHAMBERLAIN 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON and Roxbury have gone to battle stations in a long-simmering dispute with their larger neighbor, Waterbury, over rights to water from the Shepaug River.
In town meetings, called within 24 hours of each other on July 17 and 18, voters in the smaller towns flocked to their respective town halls and voted unanimously to join the Shepaug River Association Inc., the Steep Rock Association and the Roxbury Land Trust in a lawsuit alleging that Waterbury has violated a 1921 agreement, resulting in environmental damage to the Shepaug River. 
 The Mayor of Waterbury, Philip Giordano, responded last week by filing an action for a declaratory judgment in Waterbury Superior Court, seeking, he said, an unbiased legal opinion concerning a contractual agreement.
"I'm disappointed that Washington and Roxbury have decided to act in an adversarial manner," Mayor Giordano said in a statement. "For over a century, Waterbury has been operating its reservoir system in a responsible and prudent manner. Waterbury cannot and will not sit idly by while others seek to dictate the water policy, needs and uses of the City of Waterbury." Mr. Giordano continued: "It's a complex issue, but if the towns file suit against us, all the matters would probably be condensed into one issue. Our seeking an unbiased opinion would have some impact."
In Washington the special town meeting drew more than 250 people. William Fairbairn, a lawyer serving as moderator, opened the meeting by saying -- tongue in cheek it seemed -- "visitors and people from other towns can't vote, unless they vote the right way." It was clear within minutes what "the right way" was. One after another, people stood and pleaded support for the litigation.
In Roxbury the next night, First Selectman Edward Went pulled out extra chairs to accommodate the crowd. As people continued to arrive, he stopped the meeting briefly, collapsed room partitions to double the space and set up even more chairs.
At both meetings, the question was whether Waterbury, by diverting water, was killing the Shepaug River. One Roxbury fisherman said he had caught his first trout in the Shepaug in 1920. "Today, it's like putting your hand in a warm bath," he said. "Fish can't live in that river."
The old agreement, signed after Waterbury purchased property at the headlands of the Shepaug, stipulated that Waterbury release 1.5 million gallons a day from the Shepaug Reservoir from early spring to fall. But the complainants charge that Waterbury is using water only from the Shepaug and Cairns Reservoirs, while three other city reservoirs sit unused -- and that it is illegally selling the Shepaug and Cairns water to other towns. Mayor Giordano's staff say the question of resale is subject to interpretation.
Residents along the Shepaug say Waterbury's 1.5 million gallon diversion each day means the river virtually dries up in the summer months, leaving fish, crayfish and other wildlife dying in hot shallow pools. The water, as well as that from the Cairns reservoir, is channeled through pipes under Bantam Lake and into Pitch Reservoir, which belongs to Waterbury.
Washington and Roxbury residents believe that Waterbury uses their water, which is on higher ground, rather than supplies from the Morris or Wigwam Reservoirs, which are lower and would require expensive pumping. The Pitch Reservoir has a relatively low capacity, and the most economical solution for the city, they say, is to channel water from the Shepaug to the Pitch, and then into the water treatment plant.
Mayor Giordano's chief of staff, William Cugno, said that although the studies may suggest the Cairns/ Shepaug route for water, "the city officials have no technical data to support this." He went on: "We have no knowledge that our three reservoirs could supply the city's water and that's what precipitated the 1921 agreement."
Mayor Giordano, now in the second year of his term, inherited the thorny problem from his predecessor, Edward Bergin, and even before inauguration was put on notice that Washington, at least, was considering suit.
"I entered my administration with a force from those other towns publishing scathing articles in newspapers," Mr. Giordano said. "It took my administration 9 or 10 months to give them a call and explain our position. "They were rather apologetic. They had acted with a vengeance without regard as to whether we were willing to sit down and discuss this. I wanted to get the technical experts together and I thought we were making some strides, but unfortunately, passion and emotion have overridden the sense of fair play."
Washington's First Selectman, Alan Chapin, said efforts to reach a solution have been going on. The Rod and Gun Club, interested in fly fishing in the river, had initially gone to the Shepaug-Bantam River Board. The Department of Environmental Protection failed to approve a proposed plan, and a few years ago a new ad hoc committee commissioned a study by the Roxbury Land Trust, the Steep Rock Association, Town of Washington, the Washington Environmental Council and the Rod and Gun Club. That report was finished in April 1994 and forwarded to then-Mayor Bergin.
He responded to Mr. Chapin by saying, "Unfortunately, to date, the results of the negotiations have not provided me with a proposal which satisfactorily balances the City's primary concern, i.e. assuring sufficient water supply for future generations, with the Town of Washington's request for a reallocation of Waterbury's water supply. Until such balance is achieved, the City will continue to abide by the 1921 written agreement between the City of Waterbury and the Town of Washington."
Although Mayor Giordano has said he was ready to discuss the issue, Mr. Chapin said that six separate meetings were canceled in 1996, and at one held in September of that year, Mr. Giordano said that the Shepaug River was a low priority.
Mayor Giordano said that he did cancel one meeting, but that others were attended by city representatives who reported back to him.
A legislative task force, established by the General Assembly, ruled in January of this year that the diversion of water was causing serious problems and urged a resolution by April 30. Mr. Chapin said that again he was unable to schedule a meeting with Mayor Giordano.
On May 20, Mayor Giordano met with community representatives to discuss his process of dealing with the task force recommendations. "We said we would study the issue and provide correspondence within six weeks, which we did," the Mayor's representative, Mr. Cugno, explained. "The city has a charter that we must follow. No single individual can make a decision concerning an issue of this importance, but apparently this wasn't convincing enough."
Mr. Chapin and John Millington, president of Steep Rock Association, met with Mayor Giordano and his staff on July 15. "I told him that he should take this seriously," Mr. Chapin said, "but I don't think he understands how people here feel about the river."
In Mayor Giordano's recent statement he noted that a lawsuit "appeared to be inevitable. Millington was quoted as saying that the members of his group were 'chomping at the bit' to bring a lawsuit. Chapin noted that members of the Shepaug River Association, Steep Rock Association and the Roxbury Land Trust had already raised the funds necessary for the lawsuit, and at their meetings, both Towns also voted to commit additional financial support for the litigation."
Notices of the impending town meetings were published, and before Washington residents gathered on July 17, Mayor Giordano had faxed a response to Mr. Chapin's office.
"We recognize that there is strong sentiment held by some parties," Mr. Giordano wrote, "that it is necessary to engage in adversarial proceedings at this time. If necessary, the City is prepared to defend its legal rights with all of its energy and resources, and is confident that it will prevail in the end . . . if we establish a firm milestone schedule to address necessary matters in an amicable fashion, we feel that we can reach a satisfactory resolution before the start of the next dry season."
Mayor Giordano also said that upon receipt of the task force report, the city had a consulting engineering firm inspect the Shepaug and Cairns dams, reviewed the reports and studies of the Shepaug River Association, discussed alternatives with a consulting engineering firm, and investigated ideas like adding flashboards to impound more water for downstream release and potential piping changes.
Edwin S. Matthews Jr., president of the Shepaug River Association, speaking at both the Washington and Roxbury meetings, said that Waterbury's other three reservoirs produced 18 million gallons of water a day, more than enough to meet the needs of the city.
"Waterbury could use their system all year and not need to use the Shepaug unless there is an extreme drought," Mr. Matthews said. The legal action, he said, is based on several principles. "If Waterbury is causing environmental damage, the burden shifts, and they must show that there's no prudent alternative to using the water of the Shepaug," he told the crowd.
The Connecticut Environmental Act reimburses court costs for citizens who file suit if charges of damaging the environment are justified, he explained. "In addition, if an upstream owner causes problems for downstream owners, it is considered a nuisance," he continued. Also, by the terms of the 1921 contract Waterbury should only be allowed to divert water for its own needs. "Middlebury and Wolcott are now getting water illegally," he charged.
One Washington resident, Philip Farmer, who spoke at Thursday's meeting, said that a member of the previous Mayor's staff had told him that the Mayor and aldermen could never reach an agreement for political reasons. That sentiment was repeated Friday night at Roxbury's meeting.
"We have nine Republicans and six Democrats," Mayor Giordano retorted. "That is an absurd statement. We're no different than any other city and ultimately it boils down to passing an issue that affects the whole city."
The Shepaug River Association, the Steep Rock Association and Roxbury Land Trust have received pledges in excess of $300,000 to cover the lawyer's estimate of $200,000 to $300,000. But, Mr. Matthews said, it was essential to the success of the lawsuit that both towns express their support for the effort.
While Washington unanimously voted to appropriate $20,000 to contribute toward litigation, Roxbury voted to appropriate $10,000, reserving $10,000 for other legal expenses. Mr. Matthews says the towns will probably not be asked to contribute financially; their official support was the key element.
Roxbury First Selectman Edward Went explained that the town's legal counsel, a Waterbury firm, felt this was the prudent course in case of disagreement with other complainants or a decision to to withdraw from the case. In both Washington and Roxbury, votes at the town meetings were unanimous in favor of the lawsuit. No objections were voiced on any aspect of it.
In response to the towns' decision to sue, Mr. Cugno said, "we want to be cautious that this is driven by logic and not emotion." Mayor Giordano himself said, "Something as grave as the Shepaug, with the complexity of knowledge required, took me a couple of months to fully grasp. Unless you're running government with puppets you wouldn't want anything less than fully informed aldermen."
But at the conclusion of Washington's hour-long special meeting, Mr. Fairbairn asked the crowd to "stand up and yell 'aye' so the Mayor can hear us in Waterbury."

HEADLINE: Fair Time, From 4-H Plain To Midway Madness

BYLINE: By JACKIE FITZPATRICK 

 BODY:
DURING the school year, Billy Linkovich, 12, of Litchfield, has homework to do and baseball to play, so he tucks in visits to his grandfather's farm in East Canaan when he can. But in the summer, with the long stretch of hazy, hot days spread out before him, Billy heads to the farm every chance he gets.
He goes to help his grandfather and to spend time with Bambi, one of his grandfather's cows. He feeds the cow, grooms and works with her, all to prepare for the 4-H fairs. Bambi's getting a little old for showing now but Billy doesn't care. "He's quite attached to that cow," said his mother, Kim Linkovich. "He's proud to show her." 
 The 4-H organization has been in Kim Linkovich's family for four generations. When her grandmother, Isabelle Carlson, was a girl, she was in the 4-H sewing club, the cooking club and the dairy club. She and her friends would meet regularly at an American Legion Hall. "We made dresses. We cooked all kinds of things," Mrs. Carlson said. "I've always loved farm life. I wouldn't live in the city if you paid me." The tradition continued with Kim Linkovich's father, Douglas Carlson, who spent his 4-H time showing cows. Kim Linkovich did a bit of both -- working with animals and sewing. "4-H is such a great thing for kids," she said, "because it instills responsibility and it gives them the opportunity to work with animals."
And to their family, there is nothing at all to match fair season, which has just begun, a time of year when they get to show the fruits of their labor, when Billy has a chance to get Bambi spiffy and show a panel of judges what she can do; fair season is also when Mrs. Carlson participates in the old-timer showmanship contest, to show she hasn't lost her touch with cattle.
The Linkoviches are hardly alone in their enthusiasm. Connecticut is steeped in agricultural fairs, from the Durham Fair and the Goshen Fair to the Terryville Country Fair, the Beacon Grange Fair and the Hillstown Grange Fair and the New London County 4-H Exposition. Agricultural fairs have become one of the most popular destinations for in-state day-trippers and one of the major draws for out-of-state visitors. Hundreds of thousands of people hop into their cars during season and head to fairgrounds. They go in search of buttered corn on the cob or homemade pie or fried dough, to see the largest tomato someone has grown, to watch the pig races, to admire the needlework exhibits, to ooooh and aaaah over the tractor pull or the woodchopping contest and to learn more about farm life.
"Most people don't live near farms anymore. They don't know where their milk comes from or what farm life is all about and this brings them back, even for a day," Mrs. Linkovich said. Robert Pellegrino, the bureau director of marketing and technology for the State Department of Agriculture, agrees. "I think people don't really know how they obtain their food. They go to a store and pick it up," he said. "This shows them and it also shows them how vital farming is in the state."
Mr. Pellegrino is quick to point out the variety in the state. "The vegetable and fruit farms are doing so well and the nursery farms are exploding," he said, and he noted that "tobacco is very big in Connecticut."
Agriculture is a $2.1 billion industry in the state, which ranks No. 1 in New England in egg production, in milk production per cow, in mushroom production and value, in tobacco production and value and in the number of horses (60,000 according to 1995 statistics.) While farming is important to the state's economy, agricultural fairs are vital to Connecticut's tourism industry. As the executive director of the Connecticut Office of Tourism, Edward Dombroskas, explained it, out-of-state visitors plan extended weekend visits tying a visit to Mystic or Essex or the shoreline with a trip to a country fair and maybe a few stops at local vineyards. "We are seeing a lot of family travel." Mr. Dombroskas said, "and people want hands-on things to do, things that adults and children can enjoy. Fairs offer that to people."
The season officially began earlier this month with the North Stonington Fair, July 10-13. M. Eugene Bromley, who has the task of coordinating the North Stonington Fair, said that children clamor to see the pigs, sheep, horses and rabbits. The adults, he said, like to see teams of oxen pulling up to 10,000 pounds. "And some folks just like taking a ride on the Ferris wheel and looking out over the town," he said.
The fair season runs through October, and among the ones next month are the Lebanon Country Fair (Aug. 8-10), the Bridgewater Country Fair (Aug. 15-17), the Brooklyn Fair (Aug. 21-24), the Chester Fair (Aug. 22-24), the Woodstock Fair (Aug. 29-Sept. 1) and the Goshen Fair (Aug. 30-Sept. 1).
In addition, there are district fairs like the Hamburg, Preston City and Orange Country fairs, as well as 4-H fairs like ones in Windham County and in Hartford County. More than 20 local fairs also take place; among these are the Victory Grange Agricultural Fair in Colebrook and the Echo Grange Fair in Mansfield.
Some fairs are meant for thousands of tourists. They have boisterous midways, musical entertainment and dozens of food vendors.
Leonard Baginski is president of the Durham Fair, which often draws more than 275,000 people over three days in September. Visitors will flock to the rides on the midway and to see the llama competition, the baking contest winners and the crafts. "We draw the young and the old because everyone loves a fair," Mr. Baginski said.
Others, like smaller 4-H fairs, are decidedly simpler. There, members show their animals and their craftwork. They participate in the farm chore contest, taking bales of hay off the back of a pickup, for example and racing with it to a drop-off point. At these fairs, the focus is on the 4-H members.
Laura Marek, an educator with the UConn Cooperative Extension Service, said there are more than 300 young people statewide who participate in 4-H and the fair is their moment to shine. "They have the chance to show off projects they have been working on all year," she said.
While young people work toward a blue or red ribbon, adults put in countless hours behind the scenes preparing for the larger agricultural fairs. Paul and Joan Ziegler have worked for years as volunteers on the Connecticut Agricultural Fair in Goshen, which is taking place this weekend. They live in Danbury and have belonged to the Redding Grange for 25 years. "It's a lot of work," Mrs. Ziegler said, but rewarding.
Each year during fair time, committee members camp out at the fairgrounds. Late at night, after the last of the lights of the fair has gone out, they gather around and talk about the day's events -- the tractor pull, the photography contest, the excitement on the midway, the weather forecast. "We just sit up a long while and talk," she said. "The work is always worthwhile. Everyone has such a good time."
April Kapusta of Milford knows well the work involved, but, like the Zieglers, she loves it. Mrs. Kapusta, along with Richard and Lucille Murray of Stamford, owns World's Best Sundaes, an ice cream concession that goes to many agricultural fairs. She and her husband, Ed Kapusta, a teacher, started the business to make money for their children's college fund. The business flourished and the two families now work from June through October. On a given three-day weekend, they make 5,000 to 6,000 ice cream sundaes. They slice up 10,000 strawberries, whip 100 gallons of cream, mix 200 gallons of hot fudge and add 60 pounds of roasted almonds. Mrs. Kapusta's son slices the strawberries and is pretty much drenched in the color red all weekend.
"It's a very big job," said Mrs. Kapusta, who is also a real estate agent. "But everyone has always had a summer job, all the nieces and nephews. It was a way to be outdoors and to be together. We travel all over from fair to fair and so do many of the vendors, so we've met wonderful, professional people. It's like a second family."

HEADLINE: Connecticut Q&A: Michael P. Peters;
Paraphrase: 'What, Me Leave Hartford?'

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIZEL 

 BODY:
WITH his quick wit and short stocky physique, Michael P. Peters, the Mayor of Hartford, has been compared to the New York City Mayor Fiorello La Guardia -- and to comedians like Rodney Dangerfield.
In 1993 when the 48-year-old former firefighter entered politics and was elected Mayor, Mr. Peters said he had finally gotten the only job he ever really wanted. Voters in the state's capital city seconded his choice, re-electing him with more than 85 percent of the vote. 
 Mr. Peters is fond of saying that when he told his wife about his political aspirations she laughed for 20 minutes, but he says she's not laughing anymore. Neither is the Union of Retired Firefighters, which booted him out last year, even picketing his home because he successfully opposed a pension increase for them that would have included himself.
While he's been a controversial local figure as he tackled Hartford's fiscal problems, Mr. Peters has also gained some national recognition, and in his city hall office, Mr. Peters recently spoke about his tenure. Following are excerpts from that conversation.
Q. A few weeks back, after the state takeover of the school system and an announcement that the Whalers hockey team was moving out of Hartford, you were quoted as saying "It's been tough, we lost the Whalers and the Board of Education in one week." Don't both developments bode ill for your city?
A. I don't think so. Let's take the issues one by one. Let's start with the Board of Education. As everyone knows, the schools in our urban areas have been experiencing some very trying times -- not just in Hartford but in places like Trenton, New York, Los Angeles and Detroit. That's why we've been trying experimental approaches like the public/ private partnership of the schools a few years back. Even though it didn't work, I think it was worth the gamble.
Q. But that was a dismal failure; the city ended up having to buy out the company's contract to regain control of the school system. What went wrong?
A. I'll tell you what went wrong. It was just a bad marriage to start with. We felt very strongly that we needed some radical changes within our school system. Educational Alternatives Inc., the company that came in, was supported by the Board of Education and I also supported it. I thought we had to try something different. But we didn't realize the roadblocks that would be put up. People in Connecticut, like most places, are afraid of change. And that was the main problem.
Q. Why did you support Educational Alternatives?
A. Because I knew that our educational system was not working, particularly for the amount of money we were putting into it. Urban school systems in general have been trying to regain a sense of balance; we're all looking for new ways to solve some of the devastating problems like poverty, teen-age pregnancy, drug use and violent crime. I felt very strongly that we needed some kind of radical change, and I thought a public-private partnership was the answer. I was wrong. So we moved on.
Q. More recently, what about the state takeover and dissolution of the local, elected school board that was a first in Connecticut?
A. Look, one thing just about everyone in the city realizes and agrees on is that the school system has not been working to provide the best possible education for our youngsters. So we had to act. If it means calling the state in, then we did that. Most mayors would call this an embarrassment. I call this a new step, and hopefully a better step for the future of our children and our schools.
Q. What about losing all control of the school system? Isn't that a major blow?
A. No. I think what we have here is a board set up of professional people from every walk of life who understand what this school system needs. Do I think losing local control is a good thing? No, but what it says is that we're probably not electing the right people. The previous board got caught up in politics, favoritism and fiscal waste. If this new group of people appointed by the state can step in and make a difference for our children, then who can oppose that?
Q. What about the Sheff v. O'Neill desegregation case? The plaintiffs in the case are saying that there is still educational inequality and racial isolation in Hartford. They are going back to court because they say not much has happened.
A. So far, the plaintiffs are right when they say that not much has happened. I think the state legislature has to get more involved; they have to get moving on it. I think they are looking at this new state board to do something too. There are a multitude of possible remedies, including school choice, some form of desegregation, etc. But I don't think anybody wants nothing, that's not where we should be heading.
Q. As one of the 10 poorest cities in the nation and with the highest teen-age pregnancy rate and high crime rate, Hartford has a bad reputation. What would you say to the critics?
A. I would say that we are most certainly not a city on the decline. The crime rate has dropped dramatically -- about 30 percent -- and in fact is the lowest it's been in 10 years. We're linked up with the F.B.I. and the state police and because of that have been able to cut the heads off our gangs, and we're very proud of that.
Q. Whatever the perception of the city, you've managed to gain tremendous popularity. Why?
A. I think they like short fat guys. No, I think they look at my work ethic. I do work very hard. I'm the type of guy who gets into work at 7:30, 8 in the morning, and sometimes don't get home until 11 at night. I know the city like the back of my hand, having been a firefighter here for 22 years. I just think if you're honest, working hard and doing the best job you can -- people really appreciate and respect that.
Q. But the firefighters union says you're far too tough on them. Is that true?
A. I don't know. I do know that being a firefighter is a great job, a well-paying job, and when in you're in a city that is one of the poorest in the country you've got to deal with the unions and say, "Look, we can't afford to do this right now. Give us some time to get back on our feet and then we'll talk again." I think the unions have to sometimes be a little more realistic about money. They have to understand that when we can afford it, we'll take care of them.
Q. On a lighter topic, you're well known for your one-liners. Is it that being Mayor of Hartford these days requires a good sense of humor?
A. You've got to have a sense of humor to be mayor of any place, even East Cup Cake, N.J. Look, God gave me this gift of gab and sometimes I guess I'm kind of funny. Hopefully it's not insulting anyone. I have a good time with it, and I love this job and this city, so I get to be mayor and I guess a comedian at the same time.
Q. Back to the Whalers defection: what impact will that have?
A. Not much. We're not going to lose a beat because we're going to have a minor league team come in and play in the Civic Center. We may not have as many fans coming to the downtown area, but it will be a cheaper ticket and more opportunity for people who couldn't afford a Whaler ticket.
Q. But isn't the city, and for that matter, the state, going to miss having a major league franchise in Hartford?
A. Sure people are going to miss the Whalers. Am I sorry the Whalers left? Yeah. But the city of Hartford has been around for 358 years; the Whalers have been here for 22. I feel bad for the fans and players, but when you offer to build a $147 million arena and guarantee $50 million in annual revenue and they still want to leave -- then you've got to figure the gentleman who owns the team just did not want to stay here, no matter what.
Q. One of the Presidential debates was held last year in Hartford. What was it like having your city be host to such a major political event?
A. The debate was a great experience. For two weeks Hartford was a regular dateline or new item around the country, even around the world. I think the debate was also important locally. There was a definite short-term economic impact on the city -- we filled hotel rooms and saw considerably more activity in restaurants, bars and shops. And long-term, I think we generated new awareness and interest in Hartford. Many people had an old image of Hartford -- a snapshot from another time. This was our chance to update that image and I think we did it well.
Q. What about your own political future? You're up for re-election again in November. How long would you like to be Mayor, and do have any ambition to seek higher office?
A. I really don't know how long I want to be in this job. I grew up here, lived here my whole life and love being mayor. I'm just taking it one term at a time. The other day someone asked me if I wanted to run for Governor . . . and I asked them, "Of which state?" Seriously, I don't know where my future lies. Maybe some day I'll have a radio show, some people think I'd be good at that.

HEADLINE: Spec Houses Are Back in Season

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
IN 1989, Carol Konner was burned -- and burned badly. "I lost $8 million and went broke," said Ms. Konner, a tough-talking 60-year-old developer who was a major player in the Hamptons building boom of the late 80's -- and who finally has started to build again.
Last year at this time, Ms. Konner was either planning or building four houses. This year, she is actively working on 26, including a 100-acre subdivision in Bridgehampton, L.I., called Rolling Hills. 
 Ms. Konner builds "spec" houses primarily for weekenders or summer residents, and that type of construction, in the words of a contractor in Nantucket, Mass., had been "dead, dead, dead" ever since the late 80's. Speculative construction is still dead in many parts of the Northeast, even in areas where speculative second-home construction flourished in the heyday of a decade ago. According to realtors and builders, speculative second-home building is still rare along the Connecticut shore, in Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, in New York around Millbrook and Pawling and on much of the Jersey shore.
But with all kinds of residential construction booming in hot spots like Long Island's East End, speculative building of vacation homes has returned to the Hamptons and to a lesser extent in Nantucket, Martha's Vineyard and Cape Cod.
The rules, however, have changed; the spectrum has narrowed, for both builders and buyers. In both the Hamptons and elsewhere, speculative building has become a high-stakes game largely for professionals with proven track records. The banks are lending again to both contractors and homebuyers, but with vastly different criteria: Mortgage brokers and bankers say the banks want to see a lot more cash than they did in the past.
In the Hamptons, speculative construction for multimillion-dollar second homes has been gathering strength over the last couple of years, according to builders and brokers, and, as building permits multiply, land prices have soared, pushing prices ever higher. Right now, there are an estimated 100 spec houses under construction on Long Island's East End -- compared with close to zero five years ago.
On Nantucket, there are probably between 15 and 20 spec homes -- a far cry from the estimated 150 that were rising on the island in the middle 80's, according to real estate brokers there.
There are no statistics that separate speculative homes from the so-called custom homes, houses built to the specifications of the people who are going to live in them, and who are paying the construction bills. But in the Hamptons, there is clearly a building boom.
"Last week, I drove down Meadow Lane in Southampton," said Peter Hallock, president of Allan M. Schneider Associates, a real estate firm, "and there were probably -- I'm not exaggerating -- 150 trucks of workmen, working on new construction. And that's only one street. It's phenomenal." Both custom homes and speculative homes in the Hamptons range in price from $500,000 to over $3 million.
Melissa Cohn, a Manhattan mortgage broker who opened a branch in Water Mill at the end of May, said that last year, the company lent $5 million for new construction in the East End. So far this year, the company has lent $16 million.
In the Hamptons, people started building new houses because the price of existing houses had risen so much, according to Ms. Cohn: "Instead of paying too much for a house that isn't exactly right, they realize they can pick out the land and build what they want."
Speculative houses, she said, are perfect for the person who wants a brand new house "but can't bear living with the nightmare of construction for 12 months."
Nantucket, too, has been caught in the flurry of building. Two weeks ago, The Nantucket Inquirer and Mirror wrote that "building permits are as common as parking tickets on Main Street," and expressed concern that too much home building could overtax sewers and schools.
"There's quite a lot of spec building here, but it's different now," said Christopher C. Maury, an architect and developer involved in both designing and building several houses on Nantucket. "The market's a little out of whack now. It's a market of buyers who are cash-strong, and almost all of them are from New York, not Boston. In the 80's, there was heavy leveraging, and people were coming from everywhere. Now most are cash deals."
Curtis Barnes, president of Nantucket Real Estate, echoing the situation in the other parts of the region where speculative building is going on, said that "the day when carpenters, stone masons and local craftsmen were mortgaging their own houses to build a spec house is long gone."
"Those people lost their houses -- including their own," he said. "This time around, the banks are lending only to builders with deep pockets."
Mr. Maury said that in the 80's, the spec houses cost from $300,000 to $500,000. "Now, most are a half million to $1.5 million -- and up," he said.
ON Cape Cod, the only speculative building reported by Robert Kinlin, of Kinlin Grover Properties in Osterville, is on the highest end. "It started six to eight months ago," Mr. Kinlin said. "A builder from off the Cape came here to look at land. He bought 30 acres and spun off as a subdivision about 10 or 11 one-plus acre lots and kept a seven-acre waterfront parcel. Now he's building a 5,000-square-foot Royal Barry Wills-type design, a colonial with a pool. It's $3.2 million, and it's stunning."
That builder, John Lampe of Manchester, Mass., was "clearly the first -- and the only builder on the Cape to have a spec house for over $3 million," said the realtor.
Mr. Lampe owns a summer house in Dennis, Mass., on the Cape, and when the climate for new construction improved, he said, he started shopping for land. Speculative building, he said, "isn't that risky if you have enough capital, and you're not leveraged." He decided to trust his "gut feeling" and build a spectacular house, he said; "who knows whether it will fly?"
In the last six months, two more speculative homes were built: one in Cotuit, and then one in Osterville. Now, there is another speculative house on the golf course: a 4,500-square-foot Colonial with four bedrooms and three and a half baths -- "high ceilings, the whole nine yards," according to Mr. Kinlin. The house, on the market for $1.495 million, is a joint venture between Paul Birmingham, who owned the land, and Silvia and Silvia, a builder. Another owner/ developer, Bill Guarente, is about to break ground for a similar house, with 5,000 square feet, to be priced at $1.695 million, "and there's the likelihood that it will be a second home for somebody," Mr. Kinlin said.
On the Cape, the person who buys an expensive spec house is probably planning on retiring to it "three to six years from now," Mr. Kinlin said. "They'll probably split their time: six months here and six months on the east or west coast of Florida."
In the Hamptons, speculative building came back full force about 18 months ago, according to Frank Newbold, who heads the East Hampton branch of Sotheby International Realty -- "and it's back with a vengeance after being missing for 10 years."
Yet Mr. Newbold agrees with the other builders and brokers that the pattern of the speculative building market now is very different than it had been in the past.
"It used to be spec building dominated the middle market," he said. "There are still a few in the middle here, but we've never seen this before: spec homes over $3 million."
Mr. Newbold estimated that in the East End towns that are collectively referred to as the Hamptons -- East Hampton, Southampton, Amagansett, Bridgehampton, Sagaponack, Wainscott and Water Mill -- there are probably about 100 such speculative homes going up, (Town building departments do not separate houses built on speculation and houses built specifically for the person who will live in them.)
Spec homes are obviously a riskier proposition -- the developer is betting that he or she understands what homebuyer want -- but can also be more lucrative. In a commissioned house, the builder agrees to make only a certain percentage of the construction costs as profit; in a speculative house, only the market sets the profit limit.
"I don't have a set profit -- like 20 percent on every house," said Ms. Konner. "There are so many variables, like what you have to pay for the land. On some, I don't make even 20 percent. On others . . . " She paused. "I make a great deal more."
BOB IMMACOLATO, a Hamptons realtor, had until this year managed another person's office. He had made some money -- even though he began selling real estate just six months before the stock market collapse of October 1987.
"For six months I thought I was in heaven," he said. "Then the phone didn't ring for three years."
But largely because of the return of spec building, Mr. Immacolato decided it was time he went out on his own. "We started getting the risk-takers doing specs," he said. "One developer, Haddonfield and Associates, started with $800,000 houses four years ago, and now they won't do anything less than $2.5 million."
So this year, Mr. Immacolato bought a tiny little pale green house on the Montauk Highway in Wainscott, totally transformed it -- including a new pink bathroom -- and opened Twin Pines Realty, named after the two giant conifers that flank his office. So far he has sold two houses and one piece of land. "This is my shot at the gold ring," he said.
The most expensive, most quickly sold spec houses -- in the Hamptons, on Nantucket, and on Cape Cod -- look alike. Although developers almost always insist that every speculative house is different, in fact they share the same architectural personality.
First of all, they usually are covered with wood shingles. And they are designed to look as if they had been added on to over the years -- first the basic house, then more bedrooms, then a servant's wing, then a porch, then a country kitchen. Then, of course, there's a pool house -- also shingled, also with dormers. Then the big garage, often with a "studio" above.
"This is a Haddonfield house," said Mr. Immacolato, pulling into a 17-house subdivision called Seafields in Sagaponack, where many of the houses have water views from the second floors. "See the gambrel roof, the pillars, the shingles -- and all within walking distance to the beach."
Seafields is a good example of what is happening now. The subdivision went into foreclosure in the early 1990's before building began, and the land speculators gathered. Mr. Immacolato sold 10 of the lots, and bought one for himself.
"Construction here didn't really start until this year," he said. "They still haven't built on the one I owned." When he bought his foreclosed lot in 1992, he paid $194,000. Two and a half years later, he sold it for $268,000. Two weeks ago, the owners turned down $400,000, the realtor said.
DAVID SCHWARTZ, a partner in Haddonfield and Associates, leans against his white Land Rover up a rutted road in Southampton, at the site of his latest spec house. He is waiting for his wife, Jane, the other partner.
"Our niche is the $1.5 million to $3 million spec house," said Mr. Schwartz, 36, a dark-haired man who sold his Manhattan video services company in the late 80's and, after a stint selling pieces of the Berlin Wall, moved to the Hamptons in 1991.
"They found out the Berlin Wall had asbestos in it," he said. "We were all set -- Bloomingdale's was going to carry it. So I came out here -- and if you're in the Hamptons, you gotta be in real estate."
Of the two partners, he is the developer. "My wife's the builder; she has more patience with the crews and the customers," he said. "Once you sell somebody one of these houses, it's like you're married to them."
Ms. Schwartz, 30, arrives in her British green Range Rover, and they look over the latest plans for the 7,000-square-foot house whose concrete foundation spreads out into the distance. Mr. Schwartz looks at the plans skeptically. "So now we've got two eyebrow windows?" he asks his wife, who shrugs.
The house is another long and low extravaganza. To be sold on three and a half acres, it will sell for somewhere around $2.2 million, and is being designed by John Laffey, the same local architect Ms. Konner is using for Rolling Hills.
"See what happened," Mr. Schwartz began. "We started doing a certain house. Then people started copying us; they started to look like clones." This house will have "more of a European look; not exactly postmodern -- a lot of people use postmodern the wrong way -- it'll have a lot of windows, but it won't be exactly classical." Last Monday, the walls started rising; it will take about 10 months to finish. The Schwartzes predict it will sell long before that, judging from their record on their other 15 houses.
"In the 80's," he said. "they built glitter and glitz; white and bright and boxy -- just get it up. There were more doctors, pensioners and investors putting them up, so they leveraged. They put 10 percent down and they got a house, and they figured they'd make a bundle. People ran to the Home Depot, and if they were selling off surplus windows, they built a house around them."
Now, the amateur developers have dropped away, he said. "We're still very tied to Wall Street," he said, especially in the houses over $2 million. "We're just starting to deal with Silicon Valley."
The new customers want bigger and bigger houses. (Mr. Newbold of Sotheby's said four bedrooms was now necessary for a couple with two children, because the nanny must have a room of her own, too.) And increasingly, Ms. Schwartz said, they bring in consultants.
"The new thing is lighting consultants," she said. "You know, lighting for the pond they put in, mood lighting in the master bedroom; up until the last two or three houses we didn't hear 'boo' about lighting." One man who bought a house in the Parsonage Pond development in Sagaponack is bringing in a consultant in fiber optics. And one woman brought along a fitness consultant, to advise her architect on the design of the home gymnasium.
"It's not unusual for them to spend another $250,000 or $500,000 on the landscaping," said Ms. Schwartz.
BARBARA Kavovit, a first-time spec builder -- she has been a general contractor in New York City for years -- walked out of the pool house -- well, not the pool house yet. Like the rest of the compound on an acre a few hundred feet south of the Montauk Highway (the magic words) in East Hampton, the pool house is still just two-by-fours, plywood sheathing and a roof. But in the huge rambling two-story house frame, there is the beginning of the hundreds of feet of metal ductwork needed for the heating and cooling systems.
As Ms. Kavovit tries to talk, her workmen are hammering away on the pipe. "This is my first house," she said. "I'm starting another house in September." Ms. Kavovit bought a house for herself in Wainscott two years ago, and has subdivided the two acres to allow a second house, to be built on spec.
"There's an unbelievable housing boom for vacation houses," she said. "The baby boomers made their money, and they want to spend it. They're looking for houses with this type of price tag -- I hope to get $1.525 million for this one."
A "For Sale" sign is posted at the beginning of the driveway. Already, the shell of a house has been shown eight times in the last 10 days, she said. "Once the sheetrock goes up, people will really be able to see what it's going to look like."
As Ms. Kavovit plans her second house -- and as developers on Cape Cod and the Islands get ready to roll -- the old-timers in the Hamptons are already wondering if the spec house market may be becoming overheated again.
While they've been able to build their current projects on land they had bought cheaply in the recession or got several years ago at a modest price, both Ms. Konner and Mr. Schwartz wonder if land now has got too expensive for spec development.
And they are dealing with the possibility in different ways.
"Land prices here have tripled in three years," said Mr. Schwartz. "They've become really unreasonable -- what's on the market isn't even prime. To a user, I guess it's reasonable, but not for someone who has to make a profit, it's getting risky."
The Schwartzes will keep building in the Hamptons, they say, but they want to branch out. "We'd like to begin developing in the ski areas, in Utah," he said. "And we're exploring the Caribbean," she said.
Ms. Konner, too, is worried about soaring land prices. "I was fortunate to have picked up some distressed properties," she said. "If you stayed alive after the crash, you got a good feel and smell for land."
But land at affordable prices is getting scarce, and Ms. Konner wants to stay in what she calls the "mid range": spec houses that sell in the $500,000's and $600,000's.
"I see more and more people thinking that because the rents are so high, that they can buy a house and rent it out," she said, "and these people may end up in the same place as the folks did in the late 80's.
"Things are so high now that, having gone through the 80's, I'm hedging my bets," she said. "I think it's time to pull some money off the table."

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/Rockefeller Center;
Hard-Pressed a Year Ago, It's Bouncing Back

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
IT has been just about a year since an investment group led by Tishman Speyer Properties and Goldman Sachs assumed control of the then-bankrupt, Rockefeller Center.
In that time, Tishman Speyer, which manages the center, has landed Christie's, the noted auction house, as a tenant, has rented over 600,000 square feet of office space and is hatching big plans for upgrading the retail space in the center. 
 The new owners are also considering converting one of the 12 buildings in the complex into an upscale hotel and are deciding whether to continue with the current operators of Radio City Music Hall and the Rainbow Room or replace them with someone else.
In addition, they are trying to make the center more of a destination by doing things like holding a Duke Ellington jazz festival on the space used as a skating rink in colder months, shifting the flower show from the spring to summer and holding a classic-car competition on Rockefeller Plaza in the fall.
"We want to keep up the standards of Rockefeller Center, but with a more dynamic pace," said Jerry I. Speyer, the president of Tishman Speyer. "We want to bring the credibility of Rockefeller Center back to where it was 10 years ago."
Rockefeller Center, of course, is the Depression-era project of John D. Rockefeller Jr., who built the complex at a time when few other buildings were being erected. Although some of the structures are, in fact, over 60 years old, current managers say upgrades have kept them competitive with newer buildings.
"It's supposedly a known fact that at Rockefeller Center the ceilings are too low and there is not enough air-conditioning or electricity to run a business," said Philip M. Waterman 3d, a director of Tishman Speyer. "But if that was true, how could NBC or Lazard Freres or The Associated Press continue to operate?"
He said that improvements in air-conditioning, which had to be retrofitted to the older buildings in the center, had permitted raising ceilings from 7 feet to almost 9 feet, giving offices an expansive, rather than closed-in feeling. Mr. Waterman, who is usually known as Tod, said Tishman Speyer had embarked on a program of pre-building office space so that it could accommodate small tenants, such as accounting or software firms, without delay and to demonstrate what can be done with the buildings.
"We spent $50 a square foot to build out the space," Mr. Waterman said. "We want to have 25,000 square feet of this kind of space in inventory at all times."
At Rockefeller Center, this amount of idle space is hardly noticed. The 12 buildings to the east of the Avenue of the Americas have a total of 5,867,491 square feet of rental space, not including the space occupied by the NBC television network, which is a separately owned condominium. Tishman Speyer executives say that 331,183 square feet, or 5.64 percent of the total, is currently not occupied.
The old Rockefeller Center also included four buildings on the west side of the Avenue of the Americas, whose addresses are 1211, 1221, 1251 and 1271. Those are now managed by the Rockefeller Group, which is the successor to the company that sold the landmarked buildings to the east to the Tishman Speyer-led investment group. The Rockefeller Group is wholly owned by the Mitsubishi Estate Company of Japan.
Rockefeller Center was largely owned by Rockefeller family interests until the mid-1980's, when it sold the public shares in a real estate investment trust that held a mortgage on the property. Mitsubishi became involved in 1989 when it invested in the Rockefeller Group, which had continued to manage the center, ultimately buying 80 percent.
With rental rates for offices slumping during the real estate recession of the early part of the decade, the mortgage payments became unsustainable and a subsidiary of the Rockefeller Group filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on May 11, 1995. The Tishman Speyer, Goldman Sachs group reached agreement to take over the ownership later that year.
Although the two Rockefeller companies are now separated by the avenue, some entangling ties remain. One is Radio City Music Hall. Tishman Speyer executives have said they are thinking about a new operator for the theater. "We hope to have something to say soon about the Music Hall, and it should be pretty exciting," Mr. Speyer said in an interview last Monday.. Its existing lease with Radio City Productions, a subsidiary of the Rockefeller Group. expires next January.
But executives of the Rockefeller Group assert that the company retains ownership of the intellectual property associated with the Music Hall, including the Rockettes and the Christmas Show. This could make it difficult to bring in a new operator while retaining the Hall's most notable attractions.
Jonathan D. Greene, president of the Rockefeller Group's development corporation, said his company was still negotiating with the new owners about extending their tenure in the Radio City Music Hall. "We expect to negotiate a long-term occupancy lease," he said .
Tishman Speyer executives say they are still studying the feasibility of converting part or all of one of the center's office building to a hotel, to take advantage of the booming lodging business in New York.
"We are working on a concept for a very special hotel, but we don't know yet if it will work" Mr. Speyer said. "We expect to be able to say whether we are going to do it or not before the end of the year."
OTHER executives involved with Rockefeller Center say a hotel would be part of an effort to make the center an attractive destination for visitors, rather than a 9-to-5 collection of office buildings. Geoffrey P. Wharton, a managing director of Tishman Speyer, who is the day-to-day manager of the center, said his company had formed an affiliation with the Mills Company, which has been highly successful in developing entertainment-oriented shopping malls that have become leading tourist attractions.
"Those people are not in the retail business," he said. "They are in the total time-capture business. That is what we are trying to do here. We don't want people to spend 30 seconds on the skating rink and take a picture of Prometheus," he said, referring to the sculpture of the mythological figure that overlooks the rink.
"We want people to shop here, dine here and -- if we do the hotel -- stay here," Mr. Wharton said.
Hotel analysts said a luxury hotel could generate more revenue for the center's owners than office space. "If you are talking Rockefeller Center office space, the yield from a hotel could easily be higher," said James E. Fitzgerald, a hospitality consultant with KMPG Peat Marwick. "That might not be true of a newer property on Park Avenue."
The other big change expected at the center is to the retail space, which now is mainly populated with small shops catering to the tenants of the buildings. Tishman Speyer executives have made it clear that they expect to replace the shops with multilevel stores, using the below-ground concourse and the mezzanines in some buildings. They say the Christie's deal is an indication that they expect to go upscale.
"Christie's will change the retail environment at Rockefeller Center," Mr. Speyer said.
The auction house will occupy part of a parking garage that is in two buildings on 48th Street between the Avenue of the Americas and Rockefeller Plaza that will give it both storage and exhibition space. The key to the decision to locate there was the center's extensive underground loading docks, said Mary Ann Tighe, a broker with Insignia/ESG.
"Most office buildings are not equipped for intense loading and unloading," she said. But the combination of the space available in the garage and the availability of the docks make the location suitable for Christie's. "Christie's will go three stories below ground for its storage and restoration activities in addition to its showroom on the ground level and the actual auction rooms on the second floor," Ms. Tighe said. Retail analysts noted that some valuable ground-floor space in the center was occupied by relatively downscale tenants such as airline ticket offices, T-shirt shops and the Berlitz language school.
"They want to go high ticket," said Faith H. Consolo, senior managing director of Garrick-Aug Associates, a retail brokerage. "They want Armani. They'd kill for Ralph Lauren." But she said that the center's landmark status would make it difficult to make exterior changes to display new stores more effectively.
A hint of what the new Rockefeller Center retail environment will be like can be gleaned by the new Tuscan Square restaurant that is being built on 51st Street west of Fifth Avenue. The 11,700-square-foot eating establishment and store is being built on the ground floor and lower level of the building, so that passers-by at both street and the concourse levels can be enticed.
"Everything is going to go up or go down," said Richard Seligman, a senior managing director at Insignia/ESG. "You are going to see stores in the 25,000- to 35,000-square-foot range."

HEADLINE: ROAD AND RAIL;
Will Finishing a Trenton Highway Finish Riverside Life?

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN 

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
People can still remember when Trenton flourished as a riverfront city, replete with canoeing clubs, bathhouses, even lifeguards who watched boys and girls dive off 10-foot-high wharfs lining the Delaware River.
Then, in the 1950's, came the construction of Route 29 in the northern section of the city, a four-lane highway that effectively cut residents off from the river. But it was never finished, petering out onto a two-lane residential road, Lamberton Street, and leaving South Trenton's Lamberton Beach area, near the site of the current Trenton Thunder baseball stadium, as the last portion of the city offering unfettered access to the river. 
 Now, there is a proposal to complete Route 29 with a four-lane highway, linking it with Route 129 in Hamilton Township and giving drivers a smoother, faster trip to Route 1 and several interstates highways as well as the stadium.
To supporters, the 1.7-mile road would alleviate the crush of truck traffic that has rumbled down Lamberton Street in recent years. It would also, they say, spur economic redevelopment near the stadium reminiscent of that around Baltimore's waterfront stadium. But to detractors, a more appropriate analogy would be the argument, decades ago, against the West Side Highway in Manhattan, which brought in cars and pollution and cut off riverfront access.
"It's the kind of thing that has been very divisive," said Tom Arkinson, a teacher who has lived in the area for more than 20 years and supports the project.
The traffic problem started in 1994, when the state finished the Trenton Complex of roads south of the city -- connecting Interstates 195 and 295 to Route 129, and building a new ramp off Route 129 onto Lamberton Street, which rejoins Route 29 to the north.
What this work did, though, was offer trucks and other vehicles a shortcut to Route 1 and to Interstate 95. From 1994 to 1996, the number of vehicles traveling Lamberton Street in a 24-hour period climbed from 19,000 to 33,000, said John Dourgarian, a spokesman for the state Department of Transportation.
Many of the row houses in the working-class neighborhood rattle with each passing truck. Foundations are loosening, residents say. Doors and windows are kept closed, even in the summer, to try to block out the noise and the dirt.
So the Department of Transportation resuscitated the Route 29 proposal, which would build a new highway about 60 feet from Lamberton Street, along the river's edge. About one-third of the $90 million highway would be a tunnel between the Riverview Cemetery and the baseball stadium at Waterfront Park. The proposal would also create a park atop the tunnel and construct stairs 30 feet down to the river -- giving better and safer access to the river than the current dash across Lamberton Street, supporters say.
"Lamberton Street was not designed for 18-wheelers, and this will get them on a highway," said Patricia Stewart, president of the South Trenton Area Residents Society, a civic association that supports the project. "And the river, as it stands, is an eyesore. It is used now by drunks and drug addicts. With the new plan, it will look something like Baltimore harbor."
The governments of Trenton and Mercer County support the project, largely because of the belief that it would complement their plans to continue redeveloping the Waterfront Park area and promoting Trenton as a tourist destination.
"It is the key to everything," said Sharon Lauchaire, a Mercer County spokesperson, about the Route 29 proposal. "We want to create a little waterfront village."
There are many, though, who oppose the project, including the New Jersey Public Interest Research Group Citizen Lobby, the Tri-State Transportation Campaign and the Rutgers Environmental Law Clinic. They argue that a better alternative would be to ban trucks from Lamberton Street.
About 250 residents recently signed a petition urging the state to drop the idea.
On a recent overcast weekday, one of the signers, Leona Joyner, who lives on Lamberton Street, showed some visitors that the riverbank -- while admittedly a bit unkempt and strewn with debris -- was in fact accessible and used by people who liked to stroll, fish, swim or just watch the ducks.
She acknowledged that some work could be done to rehabilitate the crumbling stone stairs and clean up the pebble beach. But there are still well-worn trails, and spots for bird-watchers and fishermen.
"There's something calming about the water," said Ms. Joyner, who has lived in the area since 1978. "Now, who's going to have the view if this thing is built are the motorists who drive by for two seconds."
The project still needs permits from the state Department of Environmental Protection and the Army Corps of Engineers. But if it does go forward, construction could begin in early 1998, with a completion date set for 2001.
Neljane Rizzuto, who, with her husband, Sebastian, has lived in the area since before the Depression, is bracing for the worst.
"Just knowing that the river there is such a delight," said Mrs. Rizzuto, 82, whose sons were the last lifeguards to patrol the river in the mid-1950's. "We've swum. We've had boats. It's been a major part of our lives," she said. "But if they build this highway, there will be nothing left."

HEADLINE: SPENDING IT;
Owning a Fraction of a Jet

BYLINE: By DEBRA NUSSBAUM 

 BODY:
TIRED of airport lounges and inconvenient flight schedules? Wish you could get away from the guy with the bad breath in the next seat who wants to talk?
Here is an answer, if you can afford it: Buy a piece of a jet. 
 The market for partial ownership of small jets has taken off, helped by a strong economy, increased competition and -- perhaps most important -- growing interest among wealthy individuals.
Consider the 25 or so professional golfers, including Tiger Woods and Mike Hill, who share jet ownership through Executive Jet Aviation in Montvale, N.J. Mr. Woods has a one-eighth share in a Citation 10, and Mr. Hill owns a fraction of a Citation V.
There are many others. Don Imus, the radio personality, has a share in a Gulfstream, and Pete Sampras, the tennis star, has a piece of a Hawker.
Net Jets, a fractional-ownership program started in 1986 by Richard Santulli, the chairman of Executive Jet, has attracted corporations and what the industry calls "the concept buyer," an individual who has not previously owned a plane and is most likely not a Fortune 500 executive. About 75 percent of the owners are wealthy individuals, entrepreneurs and private companies, Mr. Santulli said.
Executive Jet has more than 650 customers who own pieces of 100 planes. For $389,000, a company or individual can buy a share in a Citation V Ultra that seats seven. The customer can fly 50 hours a year for a management fee of $3,730 a month and an hourly flight rate of $1,187 -- a total of about $100,000 a year. Such prices open a market for those who cannot afford $6 million for a whole plane -- not to mention expenses for staff and fuel.
Even if you can afford a jet, share ownership lets you move up. It costs $6.8 million for a quarter share of a Gulfstream IV, which seats 13; the part-owner pays a maintenance fee of $33,960 a month and an hourly flying charge of $2,662 for about 200 hours a year. Buying the plane outright would cost about $28 million, and maintenance could easily add $1 million a year.
With fractional ownership, your plane, or one just like it, is available on four to eight hours' notice. If there is a maintenance problem, another plane is provided. A key advantage to owning a part of small jets is that they can fly to 5,500 airports in the United States; big commercial jets can reach only 500.
About 8,000 companies own most of the 11,500 business jets and turboprops in the United States. Some 800 companies and individuals are fractional owners, holding from one-sixteenth to one-half of a plane, said Jack Olcott, president of the National Business Aviation Association in Washington.
Executive Jet sells fractions of many brands of planes, including Gulfstreams. In 1995 it entered a partnership with Gulfstream Aircraft, based in Savannah, Ga.; Gulfstream Shares does the marketing and Executive Jet handles operations and scheduling. The same year, the Dallas-based Business Jetsolutions, partly owned by Bombardier Inc., the jet maker, also entered the shares market.
Another jet maker, the Raytheon Company, based in Lexington, Mass., joined the field this year by starting Raytheon Travel Air. And Lynton Group, based in Morristown, N.J., started Helishare, where clients can buy quarter shares of helicopters.
So how do you decide if you want your very own jet, or a piece of one? Here is a quick formula from Mr. Santulli: if you fly fewer than 400 hours a year, you benefit by being a part-owner instead of a full-owner.
But part is not enough for John Travolta, Jack Nicklaus and Bill Cosby. They each have a Gulfstream to call their own.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/1998 Nissan Altima;
New and Improved. No Kidding.

BYLINE: By JAMES G. COBB 

 BODY:
THE vast middle of the family-car market has become a bit like Garrison Keillor's Lake Wobegon, where all the women are strong and all the men are good-looking. In this neighborhood, all the medium-sized sedans are above average.
But in an industry built on the four- or five-year product cycle, where competition is internecine and "longer, lower, wider" is still the blueprint for world domination, there is always room for improvement. Nissan North America is the latest to try to raise the bar for bread-and-butter family sedans, remaking its Altima for 1998. 
 By putting the car on sale this month, Nissan gets a jump on Honda, which will take the wraps off a new Accord in late August. Both cars come on the heels of a new Toyota Camry introduced last fall, the debut this year of General Motors offerings like the Chevrolet Malibu and Buick Century, and a recent revamping of the Ford Contour.
Mindful of the dangers of being radical in a segment as conservative as freshman Republicans -- the lukewarm response to the latest Ford Taurus is a case in point -- Nissan followed the usual playbook: take a strong-selling design, make it longer and wider and smoother, add features, cut costs and lower the price. And, of course, upgrade the all-important cup holders.
The Altima arrived as a 1993 model and found 670,000 buyers over four years, but it left plenty of room for improvement. While its drivetrain showed Nissan's knack for balancing spirited performance with economy, the body structure lacked tautness and many panels seemed tinny. The ride was a bit rough and noisy. The cabin was strikingly narrow and some appointments felt cheap. The last Altima I drove, a '97 version of the semi-sporty Altima SE, seemed overpriced at $21,517.
That car, thankfully, is now a memory. The '98 Altima, based on the same platform and the same 103.1-inch wheelbase, is 3.4 inches longer and 2 inches wider, and the distance between the opposite wheels has grown 1.6 inches. While those numbers seem small, they add up. The new car looks more substantial, feels more spacious and seems more sophisticated.
The new Altima's body is 20 percent more rigid, Nissan says, and the ride is noticeably smoother. The trunk has grown to 13.8 cubic feet, from 12.9. The car has gained 30 pounds -- not much, given the bigger size -- and is more aerodynamic.
Nissan has decided that its offerings will not be all things to all buyers. The Altima is available only with four cylinders, and the bigger Maxima only with a V6, so each car is engineered from the ground up for a particular engine. In contrast, the Accord, Contour, Malibu, Camry and Dodge Stratus, among others, can be had with either type of engine, but they usually work best with V6's.
The Altima gets along nicely, however, with a revision of Nissan's smooth 2.4-liter four cylinder. This dual-overhead-cam engine produces 150 horsepower, more than most four-banger rivals. Reducing internal friction has helped to add torque, or pulling power, at lower engine speeds. Still, the engine seems happiest when the tachometer needle is zipping around the dial.
Engine production has shifted from Mexico to a new plant in Decherd, Tenn. That change, along with greater reliance on parts made near the assembly plant in Smyrna, Tenn., means that the Altima is now a domestic car by Federal standards, with 78 percent American-made components.
The '98 Altima has four versions: the basic XE, starting at $15,460 including delivery charges; the midrange GXE, expected to account for 65 percent of sales, at $18,460; the performance-oriented SE, with a firmer suspension, at $18,960, and the leather-and-frills GLE, at $20,360. The prices have been cut -- the GXE's sticker is $1,500 lower, comparably equipped. Buyers of the old model have actually been paying about $17,000, so the asking prices have essentially been adjusted closer to the market value.
The GXE test car had a four-speed automatic transmission, an impressively smooth gearbox derived from the Maxima's. Well-suited to the peppy engine, the transmission picks its gears judiciously and engages in little of the gear-hunting that makes some cars surge and stumble in the hills and dells. The automatic is standard on the GLE and optional on the other models, on which a five-speed manual is standard.
The Altima's biggest deficiency is its steering, which is lighter and has more power assist than that of many rivals. The test car's wheel was reluctant to return to a neutral, center position after turning, forcing the driver to coax it back the final quarter-turn. While the car tracked well on curves, it showed a slight tendency to drift on the highway. On hard acceleration, it pulled to the side; this "torque steer" is fairly common with front-wheel drive, but Audi and Honda, among others, have largely tamed it.
None of this is to imply that the Altima is seriously flawed. It handles nimbly and competently, with a light-on-its-feet feel that complements the eager power train. In both city and expressway driving, the '98 compares favorably with the Camry. (If all midsize cars are equal, some -- like the Camry -- are more equal than others.)
While perhaps not as hushed as the Toyota, the Altima seems quieter than before, though there is some wind noise from the mirrors at cruising speeds.
Americans seemed to like the old Altima better than the Japanese did, so the new car was designed specifically for North America at Nissan's studios in California. A new grille with a horizontal crossbar provides the look of the Maxima, and large, canted taillights wrap into the fenders, accentuating the added width. In profile, the car looks familiar but more assertive.
And if the styling fails to break new ground, there will be no criticism of it here, not after the test model was pursued several miles up Manhattan's West Side Highway by a car-savvy young man in a Honda Civic low-rider. Alternately tailgating and pulling alongside, he repeatedly flashed thumbs-ups. I can't imagine that a Camry or a Malibu would have thrilled him so.
Inside, the Altima gets a revised dashboard, with prominent, no-nonsense gauges and big vents. The cup holders were moved off the dash, where they blocked some controls, into the center console. They have flip-up lids, and their proud fathers at Nissan brag that they will hold any cup from McDonald's. A bin under the center armrest has spaces for compact disks, cassettes and tissues. Both the glove box and the front-door pockets will hold 8-by-11-inch pads.
Such thoughtful touches do not apply to the back seat. Though comfortable and fairly spacious -- headroom is on the short side, as is par for this class -- the rear of the GXE does not provide a single storage space, map pocket, cup holder, ash tray, grab handle or armrest.
Other than that, the test car was not wanting. The popular midsize models now come with enough standard equipment that they're like Ralph's Pretty Good Grocery in Lake Wobegon: If they don't have it, you can probably get along without it.
Standard on the GXE are air-conditioning, power windows and locks, cruise control and a stereo with CD player. The test car also had a power moonroof ($849) and a convenience group ($549) including an upgraded stereo (with a rich sound and excellent controls) and keyless entry (which, unfortunately, doesn't include a trunk release).
The Altima is Nissan's anchor, and the company expects 170,000 United States sales a year, up from 148,000 last year. The car also kicks off an ambitious product-introduction drive, with a new Nissan vehicle to arrive every six months for four years.
The '98 Altima is a solid step toward buffing Nissan's image, which had been losing its sheen. While the previous Altima did not impress, I found the '98 more engaging. It may not have the polish of a four-cylinder Camry, but it is priced some $2,000 lower and is surely more entertaining to drive. And who can put a price on entertainment?
 
INSIDE TRACK: Midi-Maxima, medium cool.

HEADLINE: EARNING IT;
Talk-Show Host Puts His Mouth Where His Money Is

BYLINE: By DAVID J. MORROW 

 BODY:
THE house lights have just dimmed on the set of "Win Ben Stein's Money!" The game show's host, the tart-tongued actor Ben Stein, has settled into a soundproof booth while his opponent, a Los Angeles writer named Bob, tries to cough up correct answers to 10 obscure questions.
The stakes are unusually high. Unlike other game shows, which pay contestant winnings from sponsors' budgets, "Win Ben Stein's Money!" takes the booty out of the host's $5,000-a-show paycheck. The setup is a recipe for hostility. Just ask Bob, whom Mr. Stein has publicly dubbed "the trivia blob." 
 Earlier in the game, Bob looked unbeatable, easily defeating two other contestants for the right to face Mr. Stein in a final round. But now Bob, an ace who once racked up $200,000 in winnings on "Jeopardy," is struggling over game-show staples like "Which state first ratified the Constitution?"
Delaware.
Although it once sensed that it was about to witness a shellacking of Mr. Stein, the audience groans when he not only breezes through the questions but also comes up with miracle answers. Who among us knows that Uri and Zug are states in Switzerland?
Mr. Stein pocketed about $4,100 for his troubles, plus an undisclosed amount he receives under contract. Bob gets to keep the $1,900 he won in the two preliminary rounds. "Most everyone thought that he was going to beat me," the winner said. "But you can never tell what's going to happen on this game show."
"Win Ben Stein's Money!" has its debut at 7:30 P.M. Monday on Comedy Central, and it is bound to raise a few eyebrows. It stars Mr. Stein, who once wrote speeches for President Richard M. Nixon and is perhaps best known for his role as a pedantic teacher in the film "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" and for his stints as a Madison Avenue pitchman, notably for I.B.M., Western Union and Sterling Optical. History buffs may know him as the son of Herbert Stein, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under Nixon; he has also been a law professor at Pepperdine University and has written Hollywood-based novels including "Dreemz" and "Her Only Sin."
Not only is the show's format unusual -- no game show has ever docked a host's pay for poor performance -- it is one of the raciest since "The Newlywed Game." Mr. Stein's sense of humor relies heavily on hemorrhoids and hickeys, and includes remarks on recently taped shows about pubic hair and abrupt hand gestures to one's boss.
To insure that Mr. Stein does not see the questions or answers before his opponents, a security guard trails him while he is on the set, said the executive producer, Andrew Golder, 36. The security is necessary to avoid any suspicion that Mr. Stein sees questions or answers in advance, as occurred in the quiz show scandal of the 1950's.
Perhaps one reason that some people in the audience root against Mr. Stein is his TV persona, that of a Newt Gingrich wannabe. "Win Ben Stein's Money!" makes political conservatism way cool. Not only does Mr. Stein, 52, wear Reagan-red Hermes ties, he has a jolly good time poking fun at nearly everybody and everything. And he can seem downright pompous, often dismissing his opponents as "rogues," "plunderers" and "anti-war radicals."
His provocative approach to conservatism won't go unnoticed by the Republican Party, which has faced some internal turmoil of late. Comedy Central says "Win Ben Stein's Money!" should deliver an audience of 25- to 49-year-olds whose incomes average some $46,000 a year.
Certainly, the game's format is ripe for a daily spat. To win Ben Stein's money, three contestants answer general trivia questions, earning $50 and up for each correct answer. The two contestants with the most of Mr. Stein's money move on to Round 2, while the loser makes a speedy exit, after returning his or her winnings to Mr. Stein.
The snarliness heightens as the game progresses. Mr. Stein turns over the host duties to Jimmy Kimmel, a sports announcer for KROQ radio in Los Angeles, and becomes a contestant. His goal is to answer as many questions correctly as possible, assuring that no money leaves his pocket.
The loser of the second round gets the bum's rush, depositing his winnings back into Mr. Stein's coffers. The winner moves on to face Mr. Stein in a final one-minute round and can pocket $5,000 if he answers more questions than his host. But Mr. Stein is hard to beat: through tapings done by mid-July, he has a record of 38 wins, 15 losses and 8 ties.
None of this is easy. Behind every off-color category is a question that would rival many on "Jeopardy." Pick, for example, "Sitting at Home, Holden My Caulfield," and you'd get this as a follow-up: "The Glass family appears in two stories in what 1961 J. D. Salinger book?"
The answer: "Franny and Zooey."
Under another category: What is the nickname of the standard computer and typewriter keyboard? (Hint: it's named for the six upper-left letter keys.)
The answer: qwerty.
"We wanted the questions to be difficult enough to make them interesting," Mr. Golder said. "People who watch the show will think it's cool knowing this kind of stuff and that being intelligent is cool."
Clearly, the show's success rests on the well-tailored shoulders of Mr. Stein, and to a degree on Mr. Kimmel. Long known for his poison pen, Mr. Stein has tangled with the likes of Joan Rivers, who sued him in 1987 over an article he wrote about her in GQ magazine. Ms. Rivers contended that conversations attributed to her never took place. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court.
On camera, Mr. Stein shows that he still has an edge. When a contestant blurted out that there was a vaccine against syphilis, Mr. Stein roared with laughter and then said: "Well, I certainly don't think so. But if you really want to be sure, we can ask the cameramen."
Contestants appear to soak up the abuse. Anne Martel Mahoney, a creative assistant with New Line Cinema in Los Angeles, met Mr. Stein in the parking lot before the show. He wished her good luck. "I told him that we were going to kick" his backside, she said.
The slash was hardly forgotten. When Ms. Mahoney hadn't answered a question during the first few minutes of the show, Mr. Stein paused in the taping to tell her that she was there to play, too, and that she could begin any time she wanted.
"I found Ben to be absolutely charming," Ms. Mahoney said afterward. "Everyone involved with the show was very friendly. They really made it a lot of fun. I would do it again. Ben's so diligent and knows so much about everything. You want to beat him."
Mr. Stein may stimulate such feelings. Mention his name to some of his former Wall Street Journal colleagues -- he was a television columnist at the paper -- and they roll their eyes and smirk; acquaintances often describe him as a self-promoter, a term that makes the star bristle.
"What does this term, self-promoter, mean anyway?" Mr. Stein said. "I do very little self-promoting. I wanted to do this game show because I had nothing to do in the afternoon while my wife was at work and my son was at school. It's very lonely writing all day, so I decided to give this a try."
Mr. Stein taped four shows a day earlier this summer. Between each, he snoozes and listens to the original cast recording of "Hair," then changes into a new set of clothes, usually a gray or blue suit he has brought from home.
"These aren't power clothes," he said. "These are clothes for fat people." He said he and Mr. Golder had come up with a theory: "That this is the show for fat people. If you watch, the person who has the widest hips in the opening round usually always wins. I love it. I come home and I don't feel fat now that I've spent time with so many people who are heavier than I am."
So why the game show? "Let me tell you something," Mr. Stein explained during a recent dinner at Morton's in West Hollywood. "The easiest way to make money is to steal it and not pay it back. I've seen it all the time. This game show is a way to give people money."
What sounds like unvarnished capitalist talk may, in fact, not play well in some conservative circles even if the show is a hit. Although he is a vocal opponent of abortion, Mr. Stein has other, more liberal views.
"I just don't see how you can discriminate against someone just because they are gay," Mr. Stein said. "Some of my closest friends are gay, and it really makes me angry to think that they may not be treated fairly because of some silly bias. If people get a lesson about conservatives from the show, I hope they learn that we are not all what they think we are."
Madison Avenue is already betting on "Win Ben Stein's Money!" Coca-Cola, American Express, the Gap and Coors have bought space on Comedy Central's prime-time lineup and will rotate ads on the show. Microsoft and Intel are set to begin later this year.
And there's always the chance of a cult following.
Michael Jackman, a lawyer in Van Nuys, Calif., was one of only 15 people so far who walked away with $5,000 of Mr. Stein's money.
"How do I like the show? It was great," Mr. Jackman said. "I'm going to use this money to pay my student loans. Hey, Ben is a great guy. And he's real smart. So what if he didn't know what was the capital of Nebraska? Neither did I."

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
Creating a Parachute For a New Solo Flier

SERIES: FRESH START -- A periodic look at the crossraods of personal finance.

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN 

 BODY:
JANICE CROTTY hasn't got a job, but it doesn't seem to bother her.
Ms. Crotty, 31, last month gave up her $72,000-a-year position as a new-media editor at Netscape Communications to set up shop as a freelance Internet consultant. She hopes to do work for companies that are setting up their first World Wide Web sites or revamping the ones they already have. 
 And from all appearances, her timing may be just right: in Ms. Crotty's trendy San Francisco neighborhood on the south side of the city's multimedia gulch, nearly every building is home to some kind of Internet-related business.
"There's much more work out there than can be done," said Ms. Crotty, an Ohio native who likes to create collages in her spare time. She already has two clients lined up and can charge $100 an hour -- a rate that may double once she gains more experience.
This is the second attempt by Ms. Crotty, who seems born to be her own boss, at self-employment. Early last year she left her job as an editor at Gamepro magazine, a computer-game publication owned by the International Data Group, to become a freelance editor. Yet even after Netscape lured her away with what she calls a "dream job," she said she "never gave up that original vision of wanting to be independent."
In fact, her responsibilities at Netscape for Web page design and Internet business strategy "blew open my vision for what my job could be," she said. That idea, coupled with a disdain for the hourlong commute to Netscape's headquarters, she said, encouraged her to go out on her own again.
Barbara Gilliard, who owns Emeritus Investment Management, a financial planning firm in San Francisco, likes Ms. Crotty's approach. "She's not afraid," said Ms. Gilliard, who was asked by The New York Times to review Ms. Crotty's finances. "She knows she's heading down the right path and she knows she's taking some risks."
But Ms. Crotty also has much to do, Ms. Gilliard said. To start her own business, she must set priorities -- delegating bookkeeping and other tasks so she can have time to secure clients. And she should talk to a business lawyer to settle quickly legal questions like whether to incorporate.
Keeping expenses down is another important chore, Ms. Gilliard said. Ms. Crotty's goal for her first year is to match her Netscape take-home pay of $3,200 a month, and with the boom in the Web business she may well succeed. But the newly self-employed should always plan for adversity.
That is especially true for Ms. Crotty, who has few assets. While she has almost no debt aside from a $13,000 loan on a new car at 7.5 percent interest, her only nonretirement assets are a $4,000 account at a credit union, $2,500 due to her in insurance reimbursements and $2,000 owed by her clients.
Ms. Crotty has already cut her expenses considerably. A few months ago, she moved from a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco's gentrified Noe Valley district, which she had rented with her husband until they separated in October 1995, to a 2,500-square-foot loft that she shares with two friends in the less expensive Potrero Hill neighborhood. Each roommate has her own bedroom, but the three share the rest of the loft, including a large open area where they work. Ms. Crotty's "office" consists of a desk, a computer and a phone line.
Her share of the rent is $640, compared with the $800 she spent for her Noe Valley apartment. Her other major monthly expenses are $270 for the car loan; $100 total for telephone expenses and utilities; $150 for car and renter's insurance, and $100 for health insurance. Food, including eating out, comes to about $350, for total monthly expenditures of $1,610.
To trim costs further, Ms. Crotty, who says she rarely goes to the doctor, is taking Ms. Gilliard's advice and shopping for a health insurance policy with a low premium and a high deductible. She also hopes to cut back on other spending, she said.
Ms. Gilliard recommends that Ms. Crotty have three months of living expenses in an emergency fund. If Web consultants were not in such demand, Ms. Gilliard said, a six-month cushion might be better.
SETTING out to be one's own boss brings opportunities as well as risks, however, and an often-ignored one is the chance to reinvest retirement money. Ms. Crotty has $34,000 in tax-deferred retirement accounts from her jobs at International Data Group and Netscape, and now that she is on her own she can move those funds to any of thousands of possible investments, compared with the handful of options available through typical workplace plans.
Ms. Crotty's retirement accounts include about $20,000 in I.D.G. stock and $7,000 in I.D.G.'s 401(k) plan, allocated as follows: $4,200 in the Twentieth Century Ultra fund and $1,400 each in the Aetna Small Company fund and the Neuberger & Berman Guardian fund. She also has $7,000 in Netscape's 401(k) plan, divided among three Fidelity funds: Contrafund ($4,200), Emerging Growth and Equity Income ($1,400 each).
Ms. Gilliard generally recommends that Ms. Crotty roll this $34,000 in retirement funds into a more diversified portfolio that emphasizes long-term growth. "She's so young and she wouldn't need to touch it until she was 59," Ms. Gilliard said.
The $34,000 should be transferred to four mutual funds, the planner advises. She would put 40 percent in the Dodge & Cox Stock fund, which invests in large companies like Coca-Cola and I.B.M.; 25 percent in GAM International, a foreign fund; 20 percent in Oakmark, a mid-cap fund, and 15 percent in Longleaf Partners Small Cap. Over the last three years, the average annual returns of the four funds have been impressive -- 28 percent, 20 percent, 25 percent and 21 percent, respectively.
Ms. Gilliard cautions, however, that the recent high returns reflect the bull market. She says that over the long term they will probably post lower results.
"You want to be exposed to a range of markets" to help minimize the risk, Ms. Gilliard said in explaining her fund choices. While her recommendations include funds specializing in companies of different sizes -- just as Ms. Crotty's current fund choices do -- Ms. Gilliard's funds allow for more ways to diversify the assets. The foreign fund offers one such route, but perhaps the most important is the removal of the high risk of keeping 59 percent of Ms. Crotty's retirement money in the stock of just one company, in this case I.D.G.
While many of the mutual funds in Ms. Crotty's 401(k) plans are fine investments, Ms. Gilliard's selection shows the advantage of having a wide choice: On average, her four suggested funds have better three-year performance ratings from Morningstar than do the current 401(k) funds.
Whatever her choices, Ms. Crotty should not stop adding to her retirement accounts even though she is just starting out on her own, said Dirk Gilliard, a financial planner who runs Emeritus with his mother.
Ms. Crotty has plenty of other chores as she becomes her own boss. After 20 months of separation from her husband, she and he need to get the divorce they plan, Ms. Gilliard said. Although Ms. Crotty said she and her husband had already agreed on the division of their assets, the planner said, "You should clean things up and start out fresh."
But Ms. Crotty, as a single person with no children, will be able to take it easy on some fronts, like life insurance.
Also, she should limit how much attention she pays to daily work, the planner said.
"Take time to review; don't just keep plugging along," Ms. Gilliard advised. "You need to keep yourself on track and make sure you're meeting your goals."

Charts: "More of a Mix"
Janice Crotty's $34,000 retirement portfolio is modestly diversified. But it has no foreign equity funds, and the stock of one of her former employers -- International Data Group -- occupies a big slice of the asset pie. Barbara Gilliard, a financial planner, suggested a more diversified approach for the 31-year-old woman. Charts show current and suggested allocation.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
A Teachers' Pet Is Facing the Hounds

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON 

 BODY:
JOHN H. BIGGS may command a $2.4 million compensation package and rule a $200 billion investment empire, but he does not think or talk the way most corporate chieftains do.
Mr. Biggs is chairman and chief executive of the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund, the world's biggest pension system. And he remains stubbornly true to the organization's paternalistic roots. Founded 79 years ago by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching to insure that the nation's college professors did not starve in old age, T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F. has always sought to shield unsophisticated investors from too many choices and too much risk. 
 "My view is that we don't want anything in our menus that could really do damage to our participants," Mr. Biggs, 61, said in a recent interview in his office at the group's Manhattan headquarters. "We have never bagged them with an awful result."
The group serves some two million people, including current and retired college and university employees, as well as employees of other nonprofit groups. Ever vigilant of the long-term interests of his charges, Mr. Biggs is fighting a provision in the tax bill, now in Congress, to strip his organization of its tax-exempt status. He is doing so even though the change would give his pension fund the opportunity to branch out into new areas, like the corporate retirement market, that it had been leery of entering for fear of losing its exemption. "If the bill passes, we would roar ahead," Mr. Biggs said. "We would win the whole world -- but lose our soul."
When it comes to a possibility that makes for-profit ventures like Fidelity Investments or Merrill Lynch salivate -- the privatization of the Social Security system -- Mr. Biggs is equally boastful, and just as high-minded. "We would clean up -- there is no question we would be a popular choice" as a vendor, he said.
But the idea holds no appeal for him. His group, he said, "is not the right model" because it fails to guarantee people a fixed amount of money when they retire.
Too many people, he said, could end up like his former headmaster at a small Midwestern private school, who opted out of Social Security in the 1950's when doing so was still legal. "He became a real stock-market plunger" and lost everything at age 61, Mr. Biggs recalled. The school, its trustees and its alumni, including Mr. Biggs, supported him for the next 20 years out of their own pockets.
It is that kind of concern that Mr. Biggs took to the pension system. "T.I.A.A., conscious of its special privilege, always had a paternalistic attitude -- namely, that the purpose of setting aside money is your old-age retirement," said Paul A. Samuelson, the Nobel laureate economist, who is a former C.R.E.F. trustee.
Despite its lofty principles, the teachers' pension fund until recently displayed some of the worst traits of a virtual monopoly. For most of its history, the group lived a rarefied existence, as removed from the pressures of the marketplace as the academics it served. With few competitors, it saw little need to be responsive to its customers. Until the late 1980's, when competition from hungry mutual funds arrived, it gave them only two investment choices, fixed-income or stocks, and it made it impossible for them to take any money out of the fixed-income account until retirement.
"Paternalism was a mild word applied to us," said Mr. Biggs, an economist and actuary by training who spent nearly 20 years at the General American Life Insurance Company and headed the Centerre Trust Company before joining T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F. as its president in 1989. He was named the organization's chairman and chief executive in 1993.
THE arrival of competitors like Fidelity Investments and the Vanguard Group, the mutual fund giants, forced the pension system kicking and screaming into the real world. Under new leadership, the behemoth began to address the lack of investment alternatives and flexibility for its participants by increasing its offerings and being more responsive. "There has been an enormous change," said Roy A. Schotland, a law professor at Georgetown University, who was among those faculty members who pushed for change.
But the group remains convinced that it knows best. Participants continue to be frustrated by a lack of choice: They are still unable to put their money in an account that buys only foreign stocks or the stocks of the fastest-growing companies. "The assumption is that you are not given a choice because you're grossly incompetent to make the choice," said Eugene Lerner, a money manager in Evanston, Ill., who keeps some retirement money at the organization from his days as a finance professor at Northwestern University.
The group's high ideals and its authoritarian temperament make it an odd success in today's freewheeling, hyper-competitive environment.
And that incongruity raises a compelling question: Is there a place for this not-for-profit throwback in a financial-services industry dominated by profit-driven companies obsessed with selling as many products as possible and getting the highest returns?
The answer seems to be yes.
First of all, T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F. is not about to go away. Despite all the competition, Mr. Biggs remains very much a financial-services titan, in the same league as Fidelity's chairman, Edward C. Johnson 3d, or Travelers' chairman, Sanford I. Weill. His $200 billion under management makes the group the largest pension system in the world, and T.I.A.A. is the third-largest life insurance company in the United States. The group owns roughly 7,000 stocks, and its real estate holdings include the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., and the Seagram Building at Park Avenue and 53d Street in Manhattan. Its flagship stock account is one and a half times the size of Fidelity Magellan, the nation's largest mutual fund.
Having made substantial changes, the group has satisfied many of its critics. Just as important, however, is that a lot of people like to have somebody else decide where to invest their money for them, and they trust the teachers' retirement system to do a good job. They also like the fact that it is a nonprofit group that keeps expenses at a minimum. "Our customers believe our only purpose in being is to serve them," said Thomas W. Jones, the vice chairman, president and chief operating officer.
Some participants have developed strong ties to the organization. "T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F. maintains what just has to be an extraordinarily enviable loyalty," said Ron Bush, a senior vice president for Access Research, a Windsor, Conn., consulting firm that specializes in the retirement market.
The organization also benefits from the tremendous confusion over the potpourri of investment choices in the marketplace. While companies typically select a single vendor for their employees' retirement plans, universities often allow just about any financial-services firm in their doors to peddle its retirement products. Employees face a dizzying array of investment options, and many have chosen the teachers' pension system for its simplicity. The group is able to hold onto assets because it remains difficult for customers to withdraw money from the traditional fixed-income account.
Moreover, fund groups have difficulty matching T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F.'s one-on-one sessions with faculty and staff. At Stanford University, for example, employees can go to the group's nearby regional office, one of 11 around the country, for a bit of hand-holding. "It's easy for them to be a presence on campus," said James Franklin, the associate vice president for total compensation at Stanford. Other vendors presumably could open such centers, too, but it is not the way they traditionally do business.
One might think that a group with this many Ph.D.'s among its clientele would not need to offer so much instruction. But Mr. Biggs says the emphasis on education has been key to its success in fending off competition. "We do a lot of counseling," he said. "That is the future of the company. Our products may be less important; our investment performance may be less important." He hopes to capitalize on this expertise by setting up a fee-based financial planning service, for the organization's wealthier clients, as a taxable operation next year.
For all Mr. Biggs's talk about not craving the highest returns, the group's investment performance has been good enough.
Participants typically use their dollars to buy annuities, which promise either a fixed stream of income through T.I.A.A. upon retirement or, for the more adventurous, a variable stream of income whose performance depends on stocks through C.R.E.F.
Its $93 billion variable-annuity stock account, for example, invests about half of its assets in stocks tied to the Russell 3000 index, which is composed of the 3,000 largest public companies, and splits the remainder between foreign and domestic stocks that it hopes will outperform.
In the decade through June 30, the account gained an average of 13 percent a year, placing it in the top fifth of its peer group, according to Morningstar Inc., the Chicago research firm. And over the last three years, it has gained 23 percent a year, versus the 27 percent annual return of the Russell 3000. The account's international holdings help explain its lag.
The account certainly has not beaten the market, but who has? "It seems like they do an adequate job," said Robert Jennings, a finance professor at Indiana University who is also a client. "I'm not looking for the last basis point in return."
The teachers' pension system has also been able to use its tremendous size and efficient operations to keep expenses extraordinarily low. The average expense on its annuities is 0.32 percent of assets, including the cost of the insurance that is in the accounts, compared with an industry average of 2.16 percent, according to Morningstar. "It's a terrific bargain," said Mr. Schotland of Georgetown University.
But even if the pension system were to lose its tax exemption, its competitors would hardly be dancing in the street. "We don't lose business to T.I.A.A. because of its tax-exempt status," said Ellyn A. McColgan, the president of the Fidelity Investments subsidiary that is dedicated to the not-for-profit retirement market.
INDEED, after the big mutual fund groups invaded its turf in the 1980's, they discovered, much to their dismay, that the teachers' pension system could slowly transform itself by broadening its array of products and improving service.
Today, participants have a choice of 10 investment options, five of which have been introduced since 1992, including a global stock account, a growth stock account, a socially conscious stock account, a money-market account and an account consisting entirely of the Treasury's new inflation-linked bonds. It has also introduced the T.I.A.A. Real Estate Account, intended to capitalize on its long experience in the real estate market. Instead of investing in real estate investment trusts, a more standard vehicle, the account invests directly in office and residential complexes and in industrial and retail facilities.
On the service side, telephone calls are answered more promptly than they were several years ago, and transfers among accounts have been made much easier.
The group has become "a good competitor," said Ms. McColgan of Fidelity. Added William McNabb, a senior vice president at the Vanguard Group, the. "The fact is that they do a pretty good job."
The investment group, which has increased the number of participants by two-thirds since 1988, to a bit more than two million, and has nearly tripled the assets under its management to $200 billion, still controls about half the estimated not-for-profit retirement market. The second-largest private provider to this market, with about $25 billion in assets, is the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, a subsidiary of American General. Variable Annuity focuses largely on the secondary-school market. Fidelity, the rapidly growing No. 3, is right behind, managing about $24 billion.
KEEPING the mutual fund groups and the insurers at bay remains a tough challenge for Mr. Biggs and his colleagues. They are "fighting desperately," said Louis S. Harvey, the publisher of Variable Annuity Market News in Boston. "They are remarkable in how good they are but how slow to change," he said.
Mr. Biggs, though, says he is more worried about the competition from the state-run pension systems, whose chunk of the market is not closely tracked but is widely believed to exceed that of everyone but T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F. And the group is clearly making headway against them. By persuading more and more states like Ohio and Kentucky to allow higher-education employees to opt out of the state systems, it has increased its share of the 3.5 million people working for colleges and universities from about 25 percent eight years ago to 40 percent today. His goal is a none-too-modest 60 percent.
His critics, of course, say Mr. Biggs's group has an unfair advantage, that it is getting a free ride from the Federal Government. Although the organization has been taxed on the portion of its business devoted to selling life and disability insurance since 1986, it still receives an exemption for its much-larger pension business. And others, including Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who was the chief author of the House tax bill, say that just isn't right.
Mr. Archer's bill would force the group to pay taxes on the earnings from its retirement business, particularly on the lush income it earns from the reserves it sets aside each year to back the promises it makes under its annuity contracts.
Congress estimates that taxing the organization on the earnings from its retirement business would generate roughly $1.1 billion in revenue over 10 years. In typical horse-trading fashion, taxing T.I.A.A. remains in the bill's latest version. But to ease the pain, Congress has dropped the idea of taxing tuition aid for children of college professors and staff as well tuition-reduction plans for graduate students.
The group's competitors argue that the proposed legislation would also level the playing field.
"Our position is this: They do the same kind of business we do. We pay taxes, and they should pay taxes," said Thomas L. West Jr., president of Variable Annuity Life Insurance. Although the insurer is based in Mr. Archer's home district, Mr. West said his company was not behind the push for new tax treatment.
While Mr. Archer squares off against Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat and former Harvard professor who has historically been able to protect the teachers' group, participants worry about the impact of such taxes on their pension paychecks. Because all profits eventually flow back to its participants in the form of higher dividends on their annuities, "the tax exemption is worth a lot to our participants," Mr. Biggs said.
He estimated that current retirees would be hit with a decline of 3 percent to 5 percent in their monthly annuity income while future retirees could see a drop of 10 percent to 15 percent. And Mr. Biggs said that dipping into the group's $4.7 billion contingency reserves to make up the difference would be a last resort, because it might endanger the firm's high ratings from independent agencies like A. M. Best.
As he spars with his adversaries in Congress --a battle that he is so far losing -- Mr. Biggs must also contend with dissatisfaction from customers. Many participants remain frustrated at the lack of control they have over their money.
Mr. Biggs argues that the few accounts offered are true to their label. And Martin L. Liebowitz, the chief investment officer recruited two years ago from Salomon Brothers, where he headed the brokerage's research department, argues that the group's lack of choices has not hurt the participants. Those participants, he points out, include his wife. "The legacy has served a large body of T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F. participants very, very well," he said.
Still, investors are given surprisingly little information about how they are managed. Competitors like Fidelity and Vanguard have been forced to tell their shareholders how the portfolio managers are investing their money, but the teachers' pension system remains relatively mum. "Even as well run as T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F. is, it's not an open book," said Mr. McNabb of Vanguard.
THE C.R.E.F. stock account, for example, invests a sizable chunk of its huge assets in stocks that are hand-picked by the portfolio manager and his staff. "C.R.E.F. experts invest in companies they think will perform better than the stock market in general," explains the guide to the different accounts.
The prospectus and other literature are hardly more specific. Although the group publishes its portfolio twice a year, as required by Federal regulators, it does not routinely break out its largest holdings or divide the portfolio into different categories, like small stocks.
Virgil H. Cummings, who oversees the group's investments, offers only this description of their investment style: The team takes a "bottom-up, research-oriented" approach.
And Mr. Liebowitz acknowledged, "The approach is very eclectic."
Only this year has the group introduced a newsletter, Investment Forum, to tell the participants more about how the accounts are invested. The first issue featured the international holdings, listing the top 10 overseas investments, although not by account. That, the group says, is an indication that it is working on being more open.
The information gap makes life difficult for people with a clear idea of how they want to invest their retirement money. For example, those who want to put a specific amount in foreign stocks may be attracted to the Global Equity Account. "The trouble is, it's not a pure international fund," said John Harrigan, a professor at Hamline University in St. Paul. In fact, the main stock account is invested in more countries than the Global Equity account is, and both accounts have a big position in Worldcom Inc., a Jackson, Miss., telecommunications outfit, the group said last week.
While most participants probably do not mind the dearth of information, some do -- passionately. After one participant, Daniel R. Mandelker, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis, could not get the answers he wanted to his questions a few years ago, he moved most of his nest egg to Vanguard.
Still, it is tough for some people to come down too hard on a venture that, for all its faults, does seem to have the best interests of its customers at heart -- and does not have to worry about enriching shareholders.
"The good news is that they don't have a lot of perverse incentives," said Donald R. Chambers, a finance professor at Lafayette College in Pennsylvania who has a retirement account with T.I.A.A.-C.R.E.F.. "The bad news is that they have no incentives." Still, he is not sure he would want the group to look more like its competitors. "There are an awful lot of lousy mutual funds out there," he said.

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
The Wall Street Soothsayer Who Never Blinked

BYLINE: By PETER TRUELL 

 BODY:
AROUND 6:30 most weekday mornings, a motherly looking woman in a suit and spectacles catches a commuter bus with her teen-age daughter in Flushing, Queens. As the pair trundle along their 40-minute journey to their destinations in lower Manhattan, an office and a high school, they share the newspaper, do the crossword puzzle and chat about their plans for the day.
But as she rides the elevator to the 16th floor of a tall brick tower near Wall Street, this ordinary-looking woman stands revealed as someone quite different: the muse of the bull market, whose pronouncements can send stocks soaring or reeling. 
 She is Abby Joseph Cohen, 45, the chief equity strategist for Goldman, Sachs & Company, co-head of the firm's investment policy committee and probably the most influential analyst on Wall Street today. And she stands alone.
Not because she is a woman working on Wall Street, where there are few women at the relatively lofty level she has reached. Not because she is down-to-earth and slightly dowdy in a world where glitz -- or at least an estate in Greenwich, a company car and a driver -- is the rule. Not even because she is the very public face of a very private firm, the only executive at Goldman, Sachs who could be identified by many of the Americans who have picked up Money magazine or tuned in to CNBC.
No, what really makes her stand out is that she has been right about the stock market. As the market has soared over the last three years, every other seer on Wall Street has turned cautious, even cold, on stocks -- and has been run over by stampeding bulls.
Even Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has stopped carping about the stock market's "irrational exuberance," as he did last December when the Dow Jones industrial average stood at 6,400, more than 1,700 points below its current level.
Through it all, Ms. Cohen has serenely maintained that stocks would continue to climb on the wings of strong corporate earnings. She has been right, and those who took her advice have made hundreds of millions of dollars.
But now, as the market has zoomed further and faster than even she predicted -- the Dow hit a record 8,157.11 last week -- Ms. Cohen faces her greatest challenge yet. Wall Street lore is littered with the broken careers of seemingly infallible oracles, from Bernard Baruch to Joseph Granville to Elaine Garzarelli, who proved only too human when the market changed direction.
Almost inevitably, "someone is held up as the fount of true wisdom, without whom the market could be lost," said James B. Grant, a historian of the stock market and a longtime bear. "But when times change, you get blamed."
Will Ms. Cohen turn out to be just one of those people who embodied a moment, rather than analyzed it? Or will the attributes, both personal and analytical, that served her so well for the last few years continue to help her predict the financial future?
The answer will be important not just to her, but also to the legions of relatively inexperienced investors who hang on her every word. Though market gurus have been around since the New York Stock Exchange was started under a buttonwood tree, they have gained stature as the general public has grown steadily more interested in the stock market. According to the Investment Company Institute, 31 percent of the financial assets of American households were invested in equities at the end of 1996, up from 17.8 percent at year-end 1990.
Only in the last few years have mutual fund managers and market seers adorned the covers of glossy magazines -- and actually increased newsstand sales. As more employers have pulled back from traditional pension plans and more Americans have started to make their own investment decisions, the opinions of pundits have become more important to the millions of investors trying to improve returns on their retirement nest eggs.
Among these people, Ms. Cohen has become a star, based in part on her reassuring yet compelling speaking manner. While perhaps not the snappiest pundit around, she is good at coining phrases to explain her complex economic analyses, like "the Silly Putty economy," a term that borrows the name of the popular toy to characterize the extended, low-inflation economic growth of recent years. The Federal Reserve's move earlier this year to nudge up interest rates, Ms. Cohen says, was "a flu shot" to ward off any future danger of a slight rise in inflation, rather than something truly market-threatening.
This month, Smart Money magazine rated Ms. Cohen tops among strategists. She is appearing more often on public television on "Wall Street Week With Louis Rukeyser," whose host recently described her as "the most consistently correct strategist working for any major firm in the 1990's."
Amateur investors are clearly listening to her -- as are the ostensibly more sophisticated professionals who people Wall Street trading rooms. One day last November, for example, a rumor swept through the markets that Ms. Cohen, after years of championing investments in stocks, had turned bearish. The Dow fell more than 50 points.
The plunge was halted only when Ms. Cohen made a hastily arranged conference call to Goldman's traders and salesmen around the world, reassuring them that she had not changed her mind. The market turned back up and ended higher.
"I was bemused by it," she said. "First, that such a story could be circulating. Second, that it could be distributed so quickly, and third, that we could correct it so rapidly."
Ms. Cohen is clearly uncomfortable with her Delphic role -- and she is a rather unlikely oracle. Growing up in eastern Queens, where she attended Martin Van Buren High School, she loved science and expected to become a teacher, as her elder sister eventually did. Her parents, Shirley S. Joseph, who worked in the financial division of General Foods, and Raymond Joseph, who was for many years an accountant for the firm of J. K. Lasser, raised their two daughters to be studious and not hampered by traditional roles. "Reach out for what you want to do," Ms. Cohen recalls her parents telling her.
AFTER high school, she went to Cornell University and took what was, at the time, an unusual double major in economics and computer science (which involved stacking punch cards for big I.B.M. mainframes). She met her husband, David, now the chief labor lawyer for Columbia University, in Economics 101.
Soon after graduation, the college sweethearts married and moved to Washington, where Ms. Cohen worked at the Federal Reserve in the department of research and statistics while completing a master's degree in economics at George Washington University. After a few years at T. Rowe Price, the Baltimore mutual fund company, she said she got "the siren call from Wall Street," and in 1982 moved back to New York to become an equity strategist for Drexel Burnham Lambert, a firm that often gave a chance to people who were not the typical Wall Street blue-blood types.
The move back to New York made her happy; to this day, she and her husband and their two daughters, who are 16 and 10, live just blocks from her widowed father. Ms. Cohen also loved the work at Drexel, getting the opportunity to apply much of the knowledge she had acquired at the Fed and at T. Rowe Price.
But her experience at Drexel was not altogether happy. The October 1987 stock market crash, when shares lost 22.6 percent of their value in one day, caught most analysts on Wall Street off-balance, including Ms. Cohen. "We did not give our clients suitable warning," she says, even though she and her colleagues had judged the market overvalued in August of that year.
NEVERTHELESS, it was at Drexel that Ms. Cohen honed the techniques that have served her so well, especially her focus on economic fundamentals. Working closely with her longtime colleague, Gabrielle U. Napolitano, Ms. Cohen combs through scores of statistics, particularly Government figures, trying to figure out how they are put together, what they mean and what their shortcomings are.
Her forecasts are backed by pages of research and statistics that highlight macroeconomic trends, like the decline in inflation and the increased savings habits of baby boomers, as well as the big improvements in corporate profits as companies have taken a more rigorous approach to financial management. Her quarterly investment strategy books, which generally run 100 pages, are devoured by professional money mangers.
It is, perhaps, this emphasis on hard figures and fundamentals that makes Ms. Cohen different from her peers. "Abby's tendency is to try to examine the facts and to try to reach a conclusion based on that, and not the other way round, as is the tendency in our profession," said Richard B. Hoey, chief economist and portfolio manager at the Dreyfus Corporation, who worked with Ms. Cohen at Drexel.
After Drexel collapsed in scandal in February 1990, Ms. Cohen landed on her feet at the Wall Street office of BZW, the investment banking subsidiary of Barclays Bank of Britain. But after a few months, she left for Goldman, accompanied by Ms. Napolitano and Ruth Neshamkin, her secretary.
With customary modesty, Ms. Cohen says she is thrilled to have had the opportunity to work at Goldman, which she terms "the gold standard" of the financial world.
But it is an odd place to sprout a mass-market seer. One of the few big partnerships left on Wall Street, Goldman is a fabulously successful investment bank that advises America's biggest corporations -- and the world's biggest governments -- on their financial plans. What it does not do is cater to small investors; it employs few stockbrokers, and those it does have do business only with the very rich. That may be changing, because Goldman is moving more into the profitable world of mutual funds and investment management, and Wall Street in general is developing a new appreciation for the profits that come from the individual investors known as "retail."
Because the firm's business is selling securities, it would naturally frown on an analyst who told investors to sit tight, much less sell. "The challenge" for an equity strategist, said John Keefe, an analyst of the financial-services industry who worked with Ms. Cohen at Drexel, is to be "the most optimistic and not sound stupid about it."
Known for its closed-mouth culture, Goldman does not generally encourage its executives to develop high public profiles, and few have. Only a select group of Americans could recognize Jon S. Corzine and Henry M. Paulson Jr., the discreet bond trader and investment banker who preside over the firm, much less Steven G. Einhorn, who is Ms. Cohen's boss and co-strategist.
And despite -- or perhaps because of ---- her fame and mass-market appeal, Ms. Cohen has not yet received one of the most prized possessions on Wall Street: a partnership at Goldman, which in recent years has produced for its holders an estimated annual income of at least $5 million.
"That's not so unusual at Goldman, Sachs," said Steven Weiss, a principal at the Weiss, Peck & Greer investment firm, who serves with Ms. Cohen as a trustee for Cornell. Goldman has its own strict rules for creating partners, based on how much profit they bring in, he said, adding that such decisions "are made generally in terms of impact to the bottom line."
Strategists like Ms. Cohen fare poorly compared with deal-making investment bankers who snare millions of dollars for their partners. Perhaps that is why women have been more successful at breaking into the ranks of analysts; today, prominent female strategists include Gail Dudack of UBS Securities, Elizabeth Mackay of Bear, Stearns, and Ms. Garzarelli, formerly of Lehman Brothers, who runs her own firm.
But some in the financial world, particularly women, are less patient with Goldman's decision not to make Ms. Cohen a partner in its last round of appointments late in 1996. "Please, that's a very sore subject," said Linda B. Strumpf, who uses Ms. Cohen's advice to help to manage the Ford Foundation's $8.5 billion investment portfolio. Describing Ms. Cohen as "a tremendous asset to the firm ever since she went there," Ms. Strumpf says that Goldman's management is "like a fraternity."
Mr. Corzine, the firm's chairman, said in response to questions about Ms. Cohen's status: "Abby is a highly valued member of the research team at Goldman, Sachs."
John F. W. Rogers, a spokesman for Goldman, added, "We don't discuss partnership selections."
Indeed, despite the growing public reputation of Ms. Cohen and a few other prominent analysts and investment bankers, women have yet to establish their presence in Wall Street's top ranks. Barely 10 percent of managing directors at big firms are women. Even at Goldman, which steadfastly maintains that merit is all that matters for promotions, there are only 18 women among the firm's 285 managing directors, and only 11 of these women are full partners.
"I think women still have a more difficult time than men on Wall Street," said Elaine Sargent, a successful Wall Street stockbroker for 30 years. "Perhaps that makes them have to work harder to get a bit further ahead."
Ms. Cohen said she thinks that the quality of her work will be the deciding factor, not her sex. "Either you have advised clients properly," she said, "or you haven't."
Recently, she has.
In mid-1996, as other analysts predicted a downturn in the stock market, Ms. Cohen said the Dow would rise to 6,000. It did. This year, she said in January that the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index would rise to 815 or 825 over the next 12 months. It is already at 938.79, and she has raised her 12-month forecast to 950. One by one over five months, her competitors -- Charles Clough of Merrill Lynch, David Shulman of Salomon Brothers, Barton M. Biggs of Morgan Stanley and Edward Kerschner of Paine Webber, have pulled in their horns, frightened in large part by data like high price-earnings ratios and low dividend yields.
But Ms. Cohen has stuck to a resolutely bullish line on the prospects for stocks, based on the economic fundamentals. "What has really driven this bull market more than anything else has been these enormous improvements in the U.S. economy," she said. "Investors tend to focus on branches and trees and they miss the forest."
IN many ways, the key for her was understanding inflation in the 1990's. "There was a real change in inflation expectations -- people expected it to stay low," she explained. "There was no longer this willingness to buy everything," for fear the price would soon rise.
Now, she added, "You now wait for the rebate on the car, you go to the store and say 'No, I'll wait until it's on special.' "
That has had profound implications for companies, as well. They "became much more careful in how they manage their costs," Ms. Cohen said. They also became capable of producing higher profits and reporting better earnings.
It is only in the last few months that Ms. Cohen has begun to sound a more cautious note on the stock market. The prospect for stocks is now "good, but not great," she said, not least because there has already been so much price appreciation in recent years. She also says she expects greater volatility. Her 12-month target for the Dow is now 8,250.
"We're bullish, but we're not as bullish as we used to be," she said last week. She still expects company profits to rise 8 to 10 percent a year, providing good support for stock prices, but cautions that the market will experience much larger fluctuations after its long, sustained rise.
It may be hard for Ms. Cohen to be anything but bullish. She "is in a box right now," said Ms. Strumpf of the Ford Foundation. "She's gotten so much attention, if she changes her mind, there's speculation that she could tank the market."
Ms. Cohen maintains, however, that she sticks firmly to her analytical approach -- wherever that takes her. With two caveats, "Those who forecast should do so often," she said, quoting an old market saw. With a chuckle, she added a line from the Talmud, "If you predict an event, don't make the mistake of predicting the time as well."

Chart: "Still Bullish After All These Years"
In a report to her clients last week titled Mr. Greenspan Encourages Smiles, Abby Joseph Cohen outlined five fundamental reasons for being bullish on the stock market -- and noted that in his testimony to Congress last week, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, seemed to agree with her. Here are some excerpts from her report:
 
Technology
"The notable economy-wide investment in new technologies has boosted both growth and productivity, and may have led to an upward shift in the long-term growth rate of the economy. The transformation under way may be of the type enjoyed just once or twice each century."
 
Low Inflation
"Inflation remains under good control. Several factors can be cited, including the technology/productivity gains; global competitive forces; stronger dollar, and better management techniques to control costs."
 
Strong Productivity Gains
"Upward wage pressures have been muted by changes in the labor markets and concerns about job security. Mr. Greenspan seems to agree with our long-held view that anecdotal data from companies suggest that productivity is growing far faster (and unit labor costs increasing much more slowly) than would be suggested by government data."
 
Higher Savings
"The savings rate is rising despite notable increases in stock-market wealth. Individuals do not seem anxious to spend their portfolio gains; perhaps they have long-term horizons for their investments, such as retirement."
 
The 'Flu Shot'
"We expect chairman Greenspan and the other members of the Federal Open Market Committee to be vigilant with regard to the pace of economic activity and the implications for future inflation. However, rises in short rates (if they occur) would be of a pre-emptive nature, and tend to be relatively mild. In a previous speech, he used our favorite analogy, that of a 'flu shot.' The reference is to an inoculation that is temporarily uncomfortable (such as occurred in March 1997) but protects against a more serious illness." (pg. 7)

What Modern Slavery Is, and Isn't

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
SLAVERY has been in the news a lot lately. Last week, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said a Mexico-based ring had been holding deaf Mexican illegal immigrants in "virtual slavery" in New York. A few days later, the Mayor himself was accused of condoning slavery by requiring at least some of the city's million-plus welfare recipients to work at community jobs. "Rudy, we will not be your slave drivers," said posters held by representatives of religious organizations and voluntary agencies who refused to participate in the city's workfare plan. Slavery is a label applied to low-wage workers in the garment and sportswear industries abroad and sweatshops in American cities. It is invoked to condemn the sex industry and prison labor.
But what is slavery nowadays anyhow? It is a question the United Nations has been wrestling with for decades by assigning experts to look at what are called "contemporary forms" of enslavement. There have been conventions signed and conferences held, and still the word is open to considerable interpretation. When scores of Thai workers were found confined to a compound behind razor wire in a garment sweatshop in California two years ago, an American Civil Liberties Union official said the news should hardly have come as a surprise, since slave labor in the state "is one of those dirty little secrets everyone knows about."
 
Hype Factor
 
 Really?
Slavery is older than recorded human history and probably occurred in some form or another almost everywhere in the world at some time. It was common in ancient Babylon, Persia, Egypt and the Roman Empire. It was found in Asia and Africa. It did not disappear in Western Europe until late in the Middle Ages, and was still present in the Western Hemisphere when the early Spanish explorers arrived. Press-gangs rowing ancient Mediterranean war boats, captive victims in pre-Columbian sacrificial rites, Africans brought to the Americas in chains -- all are recognizable, indisputable examples of enslavement.
But as slavery seems to take new forms -- or as the word is applied to more conditions -- there is a danger that its meaning will be diluted or even diminished, said Mike Dottridge, the director of the world's oldest monitor of forced labor, Anti-Slavery International (formerly the Anti-Slavery Society) in London.
"The word slavery is abused," he said, "and it is abused so much that people begin to feel that real slavery doesn't exist. Unfortunately, it does."
Slavery is identified by an element of ownership or control over another's life, coercion and the restriction of movement -- by the fact that "someone is not free to leave, to change an employer," Mr. Dottridge said. Short of that, he added, there may be terrible situations, but they are not slavery. Low-paid factory work is not necessarily slavery, he said, though it may exploit the poor and socially disadvantaged. The United States, vaunted land of immigrants, was largely made from generations of such toil.
Child labor does not always fit the category either, Mr. Dottridge said, though there may be hundreds of millions of children at work, most of them in Asia. "Some people will go so far as to say that all cases of child labor amount to slavery," he said. "For us, looking as we do at real cases of slavery, we think that's rather a mockery of the word."
 
Ill-Defined

Jemera Rone, legal counsel for Human Rights Watch in New York, said, "Contemporary slavery has never been really defined with any specificity." But she added that in her opinion "workfare," meant to get people off welfare, does not fit the description of slavery because there is no physical coercion.
"The definition of slavery has been expanded by conventions signed by almost all countries in the world to include trafficking in women and bonded labor, which did not exist under the 19th-century definition of slavery," Ms. Rone said. "But there always are efforts by other affected populations to see if their situations fit into the definition of slavery."
Slavery is one of several terms that have suffered "word inflation," said Felice Gaer, the director of the Jacob Blaustein Institute for the Advancement of Human Rights. "Genocide" and "holocaust" are two others, she said. In an age when there is little that is really shocking, people reach for such words to draw attention to their causes or strengthen them.
When outsiders seize on the word slavery to describe some forms of labor, they can seem patronizing. Many can't imagine a poor village woman in Bangladesh or Indonesia working arduously in a garment factory for little pay unless there is some element of compulsion. But down at the ground level, women who choose such work, however odious to the foreign eye, frequently see their jobs as more like opportunities.
 
Advances for Women

On the other hand, expanding a definition of abuse does not always have negative consequences. Ms. Gaer said that the recently broadened interpretations of women's rights have given women in many countries legal ground on which to fight conditions that may indeed be forms of slavery. The prostitutes whose bodies were found chained to their beds after a fire in a resort town in Thailand a decade ago did not have the same standing to demand better treatment that others have now. The old term "white slave trade" was well chosen, said Ms. Gaer. "We politely call it trafficking in persons, but today in fact it is right to see this as a form of slavery," she said.
Contemporary slavery is not always easy to identify or root out because much of it is accepted within a society. "Debt bondage is practiced on a huge scale in certain parts of the world, particularly in South Asia," Mr. Dottridge said. In India and Nepal it is buttressed by a caste system that makes subjugation socially acceptable, he added. Advocates for the rights of outcast and low-caste people agree.
Asma Abdel Halim, a Sudanese who is Africa's director of Equality Now, an international women's rights organization, said real slavery exists in the Sudan, a contention supported by the United Nations and independent human rights investigators. Islamic tribes in southern Sudan regularly raid villages of non-Muslim animists and take away captives who must work for them as unpaid labor unless they are bought back by their clans. Race is not the issue. "We are all black, just different shades of black," she said.
 
Old-Style Bondage

Anti-Slavery International has also found traditional, 18th-century-style slavery in West Africa, where children in poor countries like Togo and Benin are seized from villages and sold into domestic servitude in Nigeria, Gabon and elsewhere in the region. In Asia, a well-organized begging industry mutilates Indian children and transports them to Saudi Arabia to plead for money outside mosques.
Illegal immigrant rings tend to operate within their closed cultural systems, like the Mexican networks placing trinket-sellers in New York and California. Migrants within their own countries are also vulnerable, among them poor Brazilians lured to the Amazon to work on plantations. "Exploiters have created a complete subculture, because after the migrants leave home, they are unable to look to the authorities, the rule of law, to protect them in any way," Mr. Dottridge said.
This fate appeared to befall the dozens of deaf Mexicans discovered in Queens last week, so they seem to fit the new definition of slavery. Their freedom of movement and action was curtailed, the authorities said, as they were crowded into apartments and monitored at work in the subways by enforcers of the smuggling ring that brought them here; they seemed unable to escape.
 
Closed Systems

Mr. Dottridge says the upswing in migration around the world, a hallmark of the age, is behind a substantial amount of enslavement today.
"It is fair to say that in the 1990's, the more oppressive forms of slavery are affecting migrant laborers who are traveling and already vulnerable because they moved from their own societies into quite different societies, where they perhaps don't understand the language and are much more easy to exploit," he said. "The minute a migrant worker leaves home, the odds are that some form of slavery will emerge."

 BODY:

HEALTH CARE
Columbia/HCA's Chief Quits
Richard L. Scott, an aggressive deal maker who built Columbia/HCA Healthcare, the country's biggest for-profit hospital chain, resigned as chairman and chief executive, and David Vandewater quit as president. Thomas Frist Jr., vice chairman, is to succeed Mr. Scott. People who are eager for a Columbia takeover of Tenet Healthcare, the second-largest investor-owned hospital chain, hope that the departures could open the door to settling an array of Government fraud investigations at Columbia -- and clear the way for the acquisition.
 
THE ORACLE SPEAKS
Greenspan Upbeat on the Economy
Speaking with more than his usual Delphic precision, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, described in his semiannual Congressional testimony a nearly perfect combination of low unemployment and scant inflation. So, he suggested, the central bank is inclined to leave interest rates steady for now, but he issued a gentle warning that the situation was too good to last forever. Although the economy cooled off considerably in the second quarter, he said, growth appears to be accelerating again; he projected a range of 3 percent to 3.25 percent for the year, up a percentage point from the last forecast in February. 

WALL STREET LISTENS
Is Exuberance Now Rational?
Mr. Greenspan scarcely mentioned the stock market, and traders found that silence golden. With no mention of "irrational exuberance," investors concluded that he was giving the market tacit approval to barrel ahead -- as it did. The Dow Jones industrial average vaulted 154.93 points on Tuesday, the first day of his testimony, to close at a record 8,061.65, and it performed small encores the next two days. The market ended the week at 8,113.44, up 226.98 points. The Nasdaq composite index also rose for the week, closing at 1,569.58, up 21.59, despite profit taking in technology shares on Friday. Bond traders were equally sanguine, bidding up Treasury prices and sending the yield on the 30-year bond down to 6.45 percent, a seven-month low.
 
BOEING BLINKS
Averting a Trade War
After giving in to the demands of tough European antitrust regulators that it abandon exclusive-supplier contracts with three American carriers, Boeing won approval of its $14 billion merger with McDonnell Douglas. The last-minute concessions narrowly averted a trade battle between the United States and the European Union, which is looking out for Airbus Industrie, the European aircraft builder. Experts said, however, that the concessions would have little effect on Boeing for years to come, because once a fleet is established, it is too costly to complicate it with other makes of aircraft.
 
TAX CUT
Republicans in Accord
House and Senate Republicans said they had resolved nearly all their differences on an $85 billion tax cut. Moving toward the House version of the bill, they said they would present a united front in negotiating with the Clinton Administration. White House officials edged toward serious give-and-take with the Republican leadership, but neither side was willing to make the first big concession. On a much different tax issue, New York City auction houses are benefiting from a 2.5 percent value-added tax imposed by the European Union, while London is losing sales of millions of dollars of art and antiques.
 
BANK MERGERS
Multibillion-Dollar Deals
"I just kept stacking billion-dollar bills on the table," said Edward E. Crutchfield, chief executive of the First Union Corporation. His company, moving to become the dominant bank in Virginia, agreed to buy the Signet Banking Corporation of Richmond for $3.25 billion in stock. And in Munich, strengthening their competitive position in the global market, two banks announced a far bigger merger. The $10 billion combination of Bayerische Vereinsbank A.G. and Bayerische Hypotheken und Wechsel Bank would create a bank with assets of $472.4 billion, second in Europe only to Deutsche Bank A.G. in Frankfurt and considerably more than the $340 billion in assets of Chase Manhattan, the biggest American bank.
 
TV BATTLES
Tarses to Stay at ABC
Ending weeks of speculation about her future, Jamie Tarses, the president of ABC Entertainment, said she was staying at the network, was deeply committed to her job and was happy to work for Stuart Bloomberg, the division's newly appointed chairman. She denied that she was negotiating to get out of her contract, which has four years to run. After a nearly year-long battle, Time Warner, owner of the Cable News Network, agreed to carry Rupert Murdoch's 24-hour Fox news channel in New York. In return it will get access to Mr. Murdoch's vast global satellite systems. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani had intervened on behalf of Fox, which employs 900 people in New York, and the city will turn over a cable channel to Time Warner for the Fox programming.
 
CORPORATE EARNINGS
The Profit Parade
With mainframe sales strong, I.B.M. earnings topped forecasts. Income rose 7.4 percent, to $1.4 billion, or $1.46 a share, 4 cents above the consensus estimate. AT&T, describing its second quarter as its "low watermark," said income from continuing operations plunged 38 percent, to $959 million. Still, it was ahead of forecasts. Exxon, with an unexpected 25 percent gain, led an oil group that was generally strong, despite lower crude prices. UAL, the parent of United Airlines, exceeded estimates with a 12 percent increase in earnings before charges. But Trans World Airlines, the only major American carrier that continues to lose money, posted a bigger-than-expected $12 million loss.
 
CYBERPRIVACY
America Online Beats a Retreat
"They always call at dinner time," said Camilla M. Herlevich, an environmental lawyer in Wilmington, N.C., and an America Online subscriber. "We call it the arsenic hour." She was far from alone. Faced with a howl of protests from consumers, politicians and privacy-rights groups, America Online abandoned plans to rent lists of its eight million customers' telephone numbers to telemarketers, less than 24 hours after the plans became widely known. For years the company had assured its subscribers that it would not release their telephone numbers or other personal information.

HEADLINE: Free vs. Managed Trade: A Question of Goals

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Second Thoughts on Free Trade" (Viewpoint, July 13), Kenneth Lewis explained his dissent to the recent report of the Presidential Commission on United States-Pacific Trade and Investment Policy. But should our country really erect trade barriers and adopt industrial policies like those of Japan? 
 It is true that some of our trading partners engage in managed trade, but do they really benefit? There are many pluses and minuses in that calculation. Some workers with jobs in protected industries gain; those in disadvantaged industries lose. A similar pattern is seen for investors. But if we use consumer welfare as our measure, it is clear that the average person loses, because tariffs and other barriers translate into higher prices.
Opponents of free trade also say that because Japan and other nations protect certain industries that they see as crucial to their futures, the United States should do the same. But consider the United States sugar industry, which uses imported labor to work the cane fields and receives much government protection, making our sugar very expensive. Is sugar-growing really crucial to the United States?
The World Trade Organization is continuing a trend toward freer trade, and, over all, the United States benefits. The real issue for our country is the cost of adjustment to free trade, as we are losing lower-paying jobs to other countries. These newly unemployed Americans deserve help.
Such a criticism of free trade would be on solid ground. But managed trade is not the answer.

HEADLINE: Free vs. Managed Trade: A Question of Goals

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Kenneth Lewis deserves special kudos for acknowledging that he has changed his outlook on free trade. Anyone who feels uneasy about the North American Free Trade Agreement and about President Clinton's insistence that we offer most-favored-nation status to China would do well to peruse Mr. Lewis's dissent in the commission report. 
 I grew up during the 1930's, when a whole generation blamed all malfunctions in our socio-economic system, from the Depression to World War II, on the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. The answer to all our problems, it was proclaimed loudly, was free trade. President Franklin D. Roosevelt sought to undo the worst effects of the tariff act, and, after World War II, his successors and the leaders of Western Europe moved slowly toward some kind of free-trade heaven in which no one need suffer the earlier tragedies. Sometimes they succeeded.
Few of these leaders, however, possessed the wisdom and insight that Mr. Lewis displays when he asks the hard question: What do we want to achieve? As he points out, we should not develop a free-trade policy when some Asian nations, and a few in the rest of the world, have no intention of giving up their respective perceptions of managed trade. American jobs will inevitably decline in both number and wages.

HEADLINE: The Post-Colonial Generation;
Caribbean Politics, American-Style

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: CASTRIES, St. Lucia

 BODY:
FOR more than 30 years, John Compton and his United Workers Party dominated the politics of this Caribbean island, guiding the British colony to independence and dispensing patronage like a stern yet benevolent father. But a few weeks ago, when voters went to the polls, the opposition St. Lucia Labor Party won 16 of 17 seats in Parliament. Mr. Compton's choice to succeed him as Prime Minister, Vaughan Lewis, lost his seat to a 28-year-old opponent.
The Labor landslide and the subsequent selection of Kenny B. Anthony, a 46-year-old lawyer and academic, as St. Lucia's Prime Minister is perhaps the most striking example of a process that is taking place throughout the English-speaking Caribbean. 
 Politicians who had run their countries since independence have given way to new leadership in nations including the Bahamas, Dominica and St. Kitts and Nevis. Combined with the deaths in March of the old stalwarts Michael Manley of Jamaica and Cheddi B. Jagan of Guyana, the Labor victory here is evidence that the Caribbean is undergoing a long-anticipated generational changing of the guard, not just a mere change of party.
 
Succeeding All Too Well
 "Every island has its own dynamic, but there is very clearly a transition taking place," said Anthony Maingot, a Trinidadian who is a professor of political sociology at Florida International University in Miami. "We're seeing a renewal of the system that is very salutary, an ascendancy of young people that is absolutely critical."
In many respects, political leaders like Mr. Compton, who first came to power in 1964, can be seen as victims of their own success. Throughout the Caribbean, the governments that took power after independence invested heavily in education. As a result, the generation that is now coming to maturity and is voting for the first time is both more worldly and more demanding, unwilling to accept high rates of unemployment, corruption and the other ills that are typical of developing societies.
"The old guys basically replaced the colonial powers, and capitalized on a certain degree of inherited submissiveness," said one American diplomat in the region. "But people are changing. With the advent of CNN and travel to North America and England being so widely available, people are now exposed to a lot more, and their perspective is different."
Unlike their parents, who placed a premium on spellbinding oratory, younger voters appear to prefer "someone more managerial than charismatic, less inclined to be involved in patronage and more oriented toward efficiency," said Neville Duncan, director of the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the Jamaica campus of the University of the West Indies.
"A leader cannot just sit back and give orders anymore," Mr. Duncan added. "He has to become a manager and try to satisfy all the various interests of a society without being dictatorial."
Mr. Anthony, a lawyer and academic whose two-month-old Government includes two female cabinet ministers who are still in their 20's, agrees. "In the early days of decolonization, the archetype was the messianic leader," he said. And that was usually someone who had earned his spurs as the leader of the banana or sugar workers union.
"Now," Mr. Anthony said, "you have a new generation of leaders who do not present themselves as examples of the hero-in-the-crowd syndrome but who are a more technocratic breed, more focused and more interested in processes and procedures."
In the non-English-speaking Caribbean, a similar phenomenon also appears to be happening, with the notable exception of Cuba. Last year, for example, voters in the Dominican Republic elected Leonel Fernandez, a 42-year-old lawyer, forcing into retirement Joaquin Balaguer, the 89-year-old strongman who had ruled the country for 24 of the last 36 years.
With the new generation of leaders has also come a marked change in the way campaigns are conducted. Most Caribbean countries are small enough that voters still demand personal contact with candidates. But as those raised under British rule gradually fade from the scene, a reliance on television, pollsters and gimmicks borrowed from the United States, such as T-shirts, bumper stickers and political rallies easily mistaken for reggae concerts, has become increasingly common.
"I'm fond of saying that the Labor Party brought theater into the politics of this country," Mr. Anthony said with a chuckle during an interview at Government headquarters here. "There is more political activity," he added, but it involves "a different kind of mobilization process."
Some are still resisting such changes, of course. Barbados, for one, has outlawed the free distribution of items like T-shirts as part of political campaigns in an effort to hold the line. "It made elections too expensive and made it too difficult for people without money to compete," said Henry Forde, a leading member of Parliament and a former attorney general. "We want people to concentrate on substance rather than form."
 
Personal Focus
 One consequence of the Americanization of campaigns is that, even though the new leaders are less charismatic than their predecessors, "elections have become more presidential, with the focus on the leader, not the party manifest or team of persons you are putting up" on an election slate, Dr. Duncan said. "In the Westminster system, the strength traditionally is in the party itself."
Hubert Ingraham, whose election as Prime Minister of the Bahamas in 1992 can be seen as the start of the generational change, has taken steps to assure that the renewal process becomes institutionalized. Before his re-election this spring, the 49-year-old lawyer promised he would not seek a third term and said he would sponsor a constitutional amendment to limit all future successors to two terms; the response from voters was a turnout of more than 90 percent that gave his party 34 of the 40 seats in the House of Assembly.
For the handful of countries that are still resisting renewal, such as Antigua, where the Bird family dynasty remains in place after more than 50 years, or St. Vincent and the Grenadines, those numbers may convey a sobering message: transform yourself now, or pay a higher price later.
"In the final analysis," Dr. Maingot said, "the new broom sweeps clean."

HEADLINE: Language Etiquette. Say What?

BYLINE: By MIRTA OJITO 

 BODY:
AS if table manners were not enough, now come language manners. In the United States, where the right to speak a language other than English is a touchy subject, at times regulated by law, the new field of language etiquette has caught the impeccable eye of people who worry about how to decline a Maori wedding invitation or how to eat barbecued ribs.
"Americans have not paid attention to the need to learn other languages as much as other people have," said Janet Nixon, a New York City etiquette consultant who has worked at American embassies around the world. "And now we are paying the price. We are surrounded by people whom we do not understand and who do not understand us and, somehow, we all need to get along." 
 Good language etiquette is one way. Interest in it is gaining popularity, especially among foreign business people in this country. The etiquette issue brings up some of Americans' most deeply rooted anxieties about language. The chief one: that someone is saying something about them in a language they do not understand and that it is not very nice.
In New York City, where nearly 3 million people claimed in the 1990 Census a native language that was not English, the potential for friction is everywhere, from the supermarket checkout line to the playground and even the elevator.
 
De Que Color Son Sus Shorts?
 Consider the elevator. You are heading to the laundry room with your curious 2-year-old, who points to a woman in hot pink shorts and asks loudly, "What color are her shorts, Mom?" But in Spanish.
What to do? Answer the child in Spanish and the lady in pink may turn red? Attempt simultaneous translation for everybody? Or pretend you did not hear and hope the elevator gets to the basement soon?
It depends. To be polite, etiquette experts say, translate the child's question, answer it out loud and hope Hot Pants will chuckle. To be really nice, explain that your child is learning colors and, even more generous, throw in a comment about how you want him to be bilingual, which is why he is learning Spanish at home first. By the time you reach the basement, you should be exhausted.
Being polite is hard work.
"Nobody said it would be easier," said Lietty Pubillones, who runs the International Etiquette School of America in Coral Gables, Fla. "Behaving well is never easy. But to get along, we must learn some basic dos and don'ts."
Ms. Pubillones's advice: Try to speak the language of the country you are in. Be tolerant of those who cannot speak your language. Do not ask people where they are from the moment you hear an accent. Refrain from asking people with unusual names, "What kind of a name is that?" Offer to switch languages if it would make the other person more comfortable. Do not talk about others assuming they will not understand (especially in an international city like New York). But use your own language in a private conversation if you wish.
The etiquette gets more complicated, though, when language is used -- or people perceive its use -- as a secret code.
Not long ago, many first-generation Americans were encouraged by their immigrant parents to learn English even if that meant forgetting, or never learning, their parents' tongue. But while the children spoke English, their wily parents used the first language to keep things from them. That has changed somewhat as Americans have discovered the joys and economic benefits of bilingualism. Still, some Americans can't shake the feeling that a conversation in another language means that something sneaky is going on.
 
They Hate My Hair
 These days exercising a foreign tongue might get you fired. In Houston, a teacher in a bilingual education program was reprimanded by her supervisors for speaking Spanish with her assistant outside the classroom. In Brooklyn, two co-workers were fired for speaking Spanish on the street outside their office. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has filed a lawsuit against the women's former employer for violating Federal laws that prohibit discrimination on the basis of nationality.
But laws cannot govern daily behavior, etiquette experts say. Common sense and good manners can help bridge differences before the lawyers are called in.
Say two co-workers and you are at the office water cooler and they start chatting away in Russian. They are laughing uncontrollably. And, you think, they must be making fun of your new haircut.
You can always ignore it. If you can't, here's what to do: "Walk up to them," Ms. Pubillones said, "and tell them in a very nice way, 'You know, you seem to be having such a good time with that joke. Would you please share it with me, so I can laugh too?' That ought to put an end to it."

HEADLINE: The Nation;
Exuberant, You Bet. Irrational? Not Now.

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
IN December, with the Dow Jones industrial average at 6,437, Alan Greenspan wondered out loud whether share prices might be reflecting "irrational exuberance."
In March, the Federal Reserve, led by Mr. Greenspan, raised short-term interest rates a notch in a move widely interpreted as an attempt to cool an overheated stock market. The Dow had moved above 7,000 in February, despite Mr. Greenspan's words of caution. 
 Last week, with the Dow at 7,906, almost 23 percent higher than it was when the Fed chairman spoke seven months ago, that same Mr. Greenspan offered congressional testimony that sounded positively cheery. The economy looks great, he said. If he has any reservations about stock valuations, Mr. Greenspan has kept them to himself.
 
Nothing to Report
 What happened? In the economy, not much; in fact, what matters is that nothing that was feared in December has come to pass. And Mr. Greenspan has evidently decided not to worry until it does.
"The economy was better than expected, corporate earnings were better than expected, and inflation is not a problem," said Byron Wien, an equity strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
In December, the unemployment rate stood at 5.2 percent, a rate low enough that many economists feared a resurgence of inflation. The consumer price index had risen 3 percent over the previous 12 months, and unit labor costs were up 3.4 percent over the same period.
Now, everything looks a little better. The C.P.I. is up just 2.3 percent over the past 12 months, and unit labor costs have risen only 3 percent. Both are lower than the December figures, despite continued economic growth that has knocked the unemployment rate down to 5 percent.
To be sure, the slide in the C.P.I. reflects mainly a reversal of rising oil prices, with inflation outside the energy sector appearing to be unchanged. But generally, optimism is high.
A theory has emerged that explains how all of this can go on for a long time. The new thinking: Technological change has provided increased productivity and the ability for everyone -- corporations, governments and consumers -- to process information rapidly enough that the excesses in inventories or construction or wages that once led to recessions can be avoided. Labor costs are held down both by rising productivity and by international competition, so profits can keep growing indefinitely.
Mr. Greenspan, in his testimony Tuesday and Wednesday, spoke about the changes brought by technology. There were, as always, caveats and vows to be vigilant about signs of renewed inflation. But what mattered to Wall Street was that he seemed so much less concerned about that possibility than he had been only a few months before.
 
'Anchor to Windward'
 "The most interesting thing was not that he discovered new insights about technology and productivity," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of the brokerage firm Hoenig & Company, "but that he, the man in charge of being the anchor to windward, was ebullient and quite unconcerned about traditional cyclical risks."
Mr. Greenspan has, it may be noted, been wrong before. Seven years ago, in similar congressional testimony, he concluded that the chances of recession were slight. In fact, even as he spoke, a recession had already begun.
But for now, Mr. Greenspan has fueled the exuberance that was already steaming ahead, whether rational or not. The Dow shot to a new record the day he spoke, and on Friday it closed at 8113.

HEADLINE: Going Wrong, Going Strong;
The Supply Side's Irrepressible Charm

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS the Democratic-controlled Congress voted in 1993 to raise taxes in hopes of cutting the Federal budget deficit, Republicans invoked the tenets of supply-side economics. They argued that higher tax rates are the cause of all problems and lower tax rates are the answer. And they warned, in apocalyptic terms, that President Clinton and his party were about to subject the nation to all manner of horrors.
"This is really the Dr. Kevorkian plan for our economy," Representative Christopher Cox, a California Republican, said. "It will kill jobs, kill businesses and, yes, kill even the higher tax revenues that these suicidal tax increasers hope to gain." 
 Four years later, the economy is robust and unemployment and inflation are as low as they have been in a generation. The stock market is in the stratosphere and tax revenues are so strong that the budget deficit is disappearing at a startling rate.
Unabashed, and even now on the verge of a substantial victory, the supply-side philosophy marches on. Its adherents are now offering the somewhat tortured argument that the economy would be even stronger if not for the 1993 tax increase. And the "pro-growth" Republicans, as they prefer to be called nowadays, continue to have an influential voice in Washington, even if it is far more muted than when they persuaded Ronald Reagan to push through the last big Federal income tax cut 16 years ago.
 
Capital Gains
 Capitalizing on their return to power in 1994, Republicans are pushing an agenda that, while not wholly in sync with the supply- side approach, reflects some of its priorities. The tax package that the Administration and the Republican leadership are hashing out is almost certain to include a cut in the top rate on capital gains. Supply siders say that will unleash a wave of investments in new companies and technologies -- never mind the Democrats' argument that it is a giveaway to the wealthy at a time when the stock market is awash in money.
"Yes, there's money flowing into capital markets, but we want to see more of that money flowing out of old investments and into new technologies that will drive growth in the 21st century," said Senator Connie Mack, a Florida Republican.
No one denies that there is some economic and political sense in the basic premise of supply-side philosophy -- the idea that reducing marginal tax rates creates incentives for work, savings and investment and thereby improves the nation's growth potential. The top marginal Federal income tax rates, for example, have declined to 39.6 percent from 95 percent at the end of World War II, and it's been a time of huge growth.
What has undermined supply siders' credibility is the absolutist approach of the most strident among them, what Robert D. Reischauer of the Brookings Institution called "the one-answer response to every economic question."
In that formulation, tax cuts can solve almost any economic or social ill. In a speech in Zimbabwe last week, Jack Kemp, last year's Republican Vice Presidential nominee and the person who comes closest to serving as leader of the supply-side movement, suggested that the solution to Africa's poverty was to foster entrepreneurship and to reduce tax rates. Mr. Kemp may have had a point when it comes to attracting foreign investment, but his idea ignored the question of how few of Africa's poor -- or its wealthy, for that matter -- pay taxes at all.
Similarly, in predicting that gloom and doom would follow the 1993 tax increase, supply-side politicians -- though not all supply-side economists -- failed to gauge the importance of the economy's underlying strength, the role of the Federal Reserve in curbing inflation and the improvement in investor psychology that came with declining deficits.
"Their political predictions have proven not just exaggerated but completely wrong," said Mr. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. "That doesn't mean there isn't truth in the underlying theory that incentives do matter. It's just that there are many other forces at work. You can, for example, raise taxes, which reduces the deficit, and the impact of lower deficits can swamp the negative incentives associated with higher marginal tax rates."
Supply siders have grown used to a state of permanent ideological warfare with liberal economists and Democrats, who continue to deride the "trickle down" theory as energetically as they did in the early Reagan days, when the two sides were debating the Laffer curve.
But if supply siders have been feeling beaten up lately, it has been less the result of misjudging the 1993 tax increase than of watching the Republican leadership fashion a tax package that contains no reductions besides the capital gains rate. Indeed, the package's biggest component, a $500-per-child credit, creates no incentives for growth.
In the long run, the outlook is bright for supply-side ideas, Daniel J. Mitchell, an economist at the Heritage Foundation, said. "By and large the Republican Party, and for that matter the intellectual public community except for the hard left, is in fairly solid agreement that the tax code will function better if we have lower rates with fewer preferences," Mr. Mitchell said.
But for now, he said, "We supply siders are completely demoralized and pessimistic because we're doing a targeted tax-cut bill instead of rate reduction. To the extent that there are any supply-side components like the capital gains tax, Republicans are getting their butts kicked on the class warfare issue."

HEADLINE: On Bombings At Resorts, Cuba Betrays Its Jitters

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: MIAMI, July 26

 BODY:
Unnerved by bomb explosions at a pair of tourist hotels in Havana earlier this month, the Cuban Government has responded by lashing out at political dissidents and jailing a German tourist for possession of what were mistakenly thought to be dangerous "explosive artifacts."
The tourist, Michael A. Reeb, 35, was deported on Thursday, six days after he set off firecrackers in a Havana tunnel and was detained by security forces. But no arrests in the hotel bombings have been announced, and with an international festival of leftist youth set to begin in Havana on Monday and a Communist Party congress scheduled for October, the Government's concerns about security weaknesses are becoming more apparent. 
 "The arrest of the German is a sign that they are nervous about everything," said Pamela S. Falk, author of the book "Cuban Foreign Policy" and a frequent visitor to the island. "With the bombing has come a realization that they are not fully in control.
"They don't know who in Cuba is doing this, and I think they don't know where to look."
The Cuban Government has blamed unidentified forces in the United States for the July 12 explosions, in which three people were wounded. But at the same time, it has rejected American requests for information to support that contention, saying that Washington, which has accused Cuba of "paranoia" in the case, would not be serious about investigating the evidence.
"We will use the evidence in a way we consider most appropriate," said Ricardo Alarcon, the head of the Cuban Parliament. "We don't have to give it to persons who we can't be sure will uphold the law or who might share it with their terrorist friends."
Four days after the bombs went off, four prominent dissidents were arrested at their homes. Felix Bonne, Rene Gomez Manzano, Vladimiro Roca and Martha Beatriz Roque all belong to the Internal Dissidence Working Group, a coalition of some 14 groups that has criticized official documents being prepared for the party congress and called for international observers to monitor municipal elections set for the fall.
On Thursday, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry said the four would be charged with unspecified "counterrevolutionary activities." Rights observers said the arrest of the dissidents, who have condemned the bombings, was not only a sign of panic, but also sent the wrong message to Cubans who wish to see political and economic change.
"These are the folks who provide a hope for a peaceful future in Cuba, who will say no to the extremists," said Frank Calzon, a Cuba specialist at the Washington office of the rights group Freedom House. "If the Cuban Government really wants to prevent violence," he added, "it is not going to do that by sending these people to prison." Such action suggests that the only alternative "is to go underground and engage in the violence everyone opposes."
No dissidents have been charged in the bombings. But the Government, in statements about the arrests, has implied that the dissidents were working with exile organizations in Miami, which Havana suspects in the explosions.
In response to Canadian and European Union concern about the arrests, the Foreign Ministry said in a note that "Cuban authorities have sufficient proof of the involvement of these citizens with leaders of terrorist groups based in the territory of the United States."
Among the many theories on the attacks is that exile groups may be using tourists, more than a million of whom now visit Cuba each year, to smuggle explosives into the country. The bombings took place on the eve of the third anniversary of the sinking of a ferryboat commandeered by would-be refugees. More than 40 people were killed, and exile groups now regard them as martyrs.
But diplomats in Havana noted that it was also the eve of the anniversary of the execution of Gen. Arnaldo Ochoa, a reformist military leader convicted in a 1989 show trial. This, one diplomat said, "suggests the possibility it could have been one of their own people."
Dr. Falk noted that the Cuban security apparatus contains "hard-line factions that want to crack down." One way to further this end would be to undermine the Government and its recent economic opening. But the Cuban leaders themselves, she said, "would not want to cut off their only source of income." Tourism has in recent years surpassed sugar as the country's principal source of foreign exchange.
"All of this will have an impact on tourism," Dr. Falk warned, referring both to the bombing and the security crackdown. "This creates a sense that Cuba is not a safe place."

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy Sees Role in Cambodia for Asian Foreign Ministers

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, July 26

 BODY:
The American special envoy for Cambodia, Stephen J. Solarz, found enough flexibility in his conversations with the Cambodian leader, Hun Sen, to allow Asian foreign ministers to continue looking for a solution to the political crisis there, an American official here said today.
Mr. Solarz thinks a solution "is doable, but very difficult," though he is "not overly optimistic that an agreement will be achieved," the official said, in an extensive briefing about the former Congressman's weeklong mission through Asia to explore possibilities for a Cambodian settlement. 
 Mr. Hun Sen, the co-Prime Minister who seized power earlier this month as the other co-Prime Minister, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, left the country, is clearly reluctant to allow any serious challenge to his authority and has only grudgingly agreed to outside mediation.
Mr. Hun Sen did discuss with Mr. Solarz proposals to disarm at least some of the provincial militias under his control and to reduce his 1,500-member force of "personal bodyguards," called Brigade 70, in the period before elections in late May, the official said.
The main challenge will be to create an atmosphere for elections that are free and fair, in which followers of Prince Ranariddh and his royalist party -- including those who have fled Cambodia -- feel they can take part, the official said.
Prince Ranariddh, for his part, told Mr. Solarz that he was willing to give up his position as First Prime Minister if he is allowed to pick a successor, the official said. Foreign Minister Ung Huot has been chosen by Mr. Hun Sen to fill the post, and the Cambodian legislature will vote on that replacement in about a week. Washington is unlikely to accept that vote as legitimate, officials said.
Mr. Solarz reported today to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who is here attending meetings of the nine-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or Asean. The group, which postponed Cambodia's entrance into the organization at its 30th anniversary summit meeting here, is taking the lead role in trying to resolve the situation in Cambodia.
Asean includes Brunei, Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos.
Asean's delegation of the Foreign Ministers of Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines was treated rudely by Mr. Hun Sen in its first visit to Cambodia last Saturday. "He lectured them for 90 minutes on all the sins of Ranariddh," the official said.
But then Mr. Hun Sen cooled down. His discussions with Mr. Solarz on Friday were more substantive, and he agreed to allow Asean to play a role in "contributing to peace and stability in Cambodia," the official said, but through the Asean principle of noninterference in internal affairs.
That ambiguity bothers senior American officials, but the Asean Foreign Ministers will return to Phnom Penh for another meeting with Mr. Hun Sen, because they have been assured that the kinds of details he discussed with Mr. Solarz will be on the table.
"The challenge Asean will face is to translate these broad principles into concrete practice," the official said. But he called the Asean initiative the "best and perhaps last chance" to resolve the crisis and said the United States could not be successful if it acted unilaterally or took a position based only on principles and not reality.
Ms. Albright also met today with the Chinese Foreign Minister, Qian Qichen, to prepare for a state visit to the United States by the Chinese President, Jiang Zemin, which is expected to take place at the end of October, probably on the 28th, officials said today.

HEADLINE: SPORTS BUSINESS: Wish Upon a Star, Be One;
Disney Gives Kids Chance to Play Like the Pros

BYLINE: By ROBERT LIPSYTE 

DATELINE: ORLANDO, Fla.

 BODY:
Rob Riviere, an investment banker from Texas, went to Disney World last weekend with his wife and son, but he did not expect to get to Space Mountain or the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror and did not much care. The Rivieres were on a real fantasy vacation. Rhett, 17, would be pitching for the Austin Slams, one of 64 teams in the Amateur Athletic Union's 18-and-under baseball championship.
"We've spent maybe $5,000 on travel and fees for Rhett this year," Riviere said, "but when you look at this place. . . ." 
 He just stopped, shook his head, and looked at this place, a typical response to the lushly turfed, lemon-colored 7,500-seat Ballpark, dubbed "Florida picturesque" by its architect. The brand-new park glowed with nostalgic Disney artifice, evoking those good old days when athletes played only for love and were close enough to touch.
In this green corner of sports' newest magic kingdom, young Rhett would be showing his live right arm to the college and pro scouts who could pay off his dad's investment and make his dreams come true.
Disney's 200-acre Wide World of Sports, which opened four months ago in the southwest corner of the 43-square-mile Walt Disney World here, is the future of sport, the present repackaged as the past for young athletes and the moms and dads who live to cheer them on.
While the complex will play host to the Atlanta Braves, the Harlem Globetrotters and the Indiana Pacers, the pros will be the Mickeys and the Goofys drawing into the tent millions of amateurs and their families, who will need meals, hotel rooms, entertainment, gift shops.
"Not everyone gets to play in the Super Bowl," said Reggie Williams, the only Disney vice president who has played in two, with the Cincinnati Bengals. "We want to offer the very best sports experience to young athletes, to give them the chance to be stained with the same grass that stained their heroes. Our core audience is that 10-year-old girl with the hope of a bright sports future."
Even as he spoke last weekend, the A.A.U.'s 13-and-under girls' national basketball championship was ending in an exuberant final game cheered by hundreds of moms, dads and grandmas. On the other level of the Fieldhouse of dreams (there are six full courts), a national "super showcase" for 32 teams of high-school-age basketball players was starting.
There were far fewer moms and dads here, for this was a standard summer meat market cobbled together by the A.A.U for Nike, so that several hundred big-time college coaches could continue their mating dances with future players.
And beyond the outfield fences of the baseball tournament, a USA Track and Field developmental meet for young decathletes shared a blazing central Florida sun with the state tennis association's tournament for 30- to 50-year-olds. Unused at the moment were the softball, the soccer and football fields; the beach volleyball courts; the velodrome, and the cricket pitch.
 
Lucrative Horizons In Youth Business
 "Pro athletes are out of control and kids' sports is the business of the future," said Bobby Dodd, the 48-year-old Memphis businessman and former Y.M.C.A executive who has been president of the A.A.U. since 1991. "People know that college sports and the Olympics are big business, but they are just coming to realize that kids' sports fits right into that category. It is an extension of the convention business. What they call 'heads in beds.' Our product has a major economic impact on an area."
No wonder that Disney's director of sports events, the 41-year-old Mike Millay, a former wrestling champion from Louisiana State, came here from a job in New Orleans, where he attracted and was host to the Super Bowl and the Final Four and founded the National Association of Sports Commissions.
"We are thinking of a preschool sports tournament," Millay said. "We think of ourselves as a moral company, in crime prevention along with the sports and recreation departments around the country. We care about at-risk youth.
"The ideal atmosphere for me here," he said, "is when amateur kids and pro glitz get together -- the N.F.L. Quarterback Challenge and the team handball championships."
The 30-year agreement between Disney and the A.A.U. gives the vacation center access to some 450,000 amateur athletes engaged in 221 national championships in 32 sports, according to Dodd. While it is not an exclusive deal, the A.A.U. has first crack at filling up the Disney calendar, and keeping rivals out. This, according to Dodd, stimulated the A.A.U. to approach Nike and run its basketball showcase.
Williams said that Disney does not "do shoe deals," although the stores in the sports complex seemed to display only Disney and Nike logos.
The logo of Nike's current basketball rival, Adidas, was visible, however, on the golf shirts of college coaches from Adidas schools as they prowled and strutted the sidelines of the invitation-only basketball tournament in what sometimes resembled a fraternity house party. But in this case, mostly middle-aged white men were scoping teen-age black players from Detroit, Houston, California and New York's Riverside Church Hawks.
"It's against N.C.A.A. rules to talk to them," said a young assistant coach. "I can't even talk to a reporter about them on the record. But you want to make sure they see you, know you're interested. And when you call them up later, you'll remind them you saw them at Disney World."
Among the celebrity coaches were Tubby Smith of Kentucky, Mike Krzyzewski of Duke and Roy Williams of Kansas, all of whom have been making the rounds of this summer's camps and tournaments for the incoming high school seniors who will be college freshmen in the fall of 1998 (if they don't go directly to the National Basketball Association).
 
A Parade of Pros Ready to Step Out
 When Wide World of Sports, which cost a reported $100 million, officially opened March 28, the debut event was an exhibition game between the Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds. It signaled detente, if not alliance, between those competitive sports moguls, the Disney chairman, Michael Eisner (Anaheim Angels, Mighty Ducks), and the Time-Warner vice chairman, Ted Turner (Braves, Hawks).
Next spring, the Braves will actually train at the complex, and regularly play in the park, which also has 2,500 Tanglewood-style lawn spots along the left-field line.
Next fall, the Indiana Pacers will hold their one-week training camp here. No doubt there will be jokes about a new Disney character, Larry Bird. But a Pacer spokesman said last week that the lure was not so much the amusement park (the Pacers will not bring their families) as the sports facilities -- the spring-loaded hardwood floors, the state-of-the-art weight room (with sound and visual effects to encourage effort), the plush locker rooms -- and the Disney style of discreet yet firm crowd and news media control, which is particularly appealing to the rookie Coach Bird.
The Braves and the Pacers (some of their practices will be open) will help draw crowds by their presence and the sense of sharing athletic space with lesser performers.
"As sports becomes more global," Williams said, "we must recapture its intimacy, put the fan near the player, the enthusiast in the same locker room as the star."
A big, smooth 42-year-old, Williams talks about coming out of "a small school in New Hampshire," and leaves it to the publicists to drop the name Dartmouth, where he was the Ivy League heavyweight wrestling champion. He spent 14 seasons as a linebacker for the Bengals, and was elected to the Cincinnati City Council.
He has a foreign policy -- Disney sports has an agreement to develop events for South Africa's teams -- and an interest in community outreach.
Richard Lapchick, the founder and director of Northeastern University's Center for the Study of Sport and Society, relocated to Orlando from Boston for personal reasons and wound up with an office here, off Victory Way.
 
Managed Reality In the Magic Kingdom
 Williams also has his own style. He has been quoted as saying "Mickey doesn't live here." He insists on calling his staff "a team" and that they wear "uniforms," despite the Disney lingua franca of "cast" and "costume." But he is clearly aware of the commercial fit between what he calls the "authenticity of sports" and Disney's signature fabrication.
"There has never been a sports drama as good as the real thing, the performance, the competition," Williams said. "I love the true emotions of this place.
"But, when the tears dry, we can all go to Space Mountain."
Or to the All-Star Cafe, which expects to open a branch here next fall. Until then, competitors and spectators have to make do at the concession stands with $2.50 24-ounce bottles of water and $3 hot dogs. Signs offer reminders that "Personal food or beverage" is not allowed.
As Dodd, the A.A.U. president, explains, "My daddy, a good Southern Baptist, once told me, 'If the church can't pay its bills, the Lord can't save no souls.' "
Rob Riviere, the Austin, Tex., investment banker, was thrilled when Rhett's school, St. Michael's Academy, won the state private school championship, but it was his son's selection to the Slams junior team that increased his chances for a college scholarship or a pro contract. At the very least, the family would have a transcendent experience in a place that evoked "ball park," not field or stadium.
"Kids never see a facility like this," said the Slams' coach, Tommy Boggs, who pitched nine years in the majors for the Braves and the Rangers. "Hey, I left when my arm went bad in '85 and I'd never seen a spring training facility as good as this. They'll always remember it."
The crisp authenticity of the immediate sports experience here is undeniable, although the picture becomes less clear as the camera pulls back (yes, there are up-to-date broadcast facilities).
If Wide World of Sports sounds familiar, just remember that Disney owns ABC, as well as ESPN. Add the A.A.U., the corporate interlocks that come with the Braves, the association with Nike. The grass stain shared by Rhett Riviere and Ken Griffey Jr. (he came by to check on the All-Star Cafe construction) becomes the outline of a small world after all, perhaps even a new world order in sports.
Outside the white lines lies genuine inauthenticity, resorts that resemble a slumless Atlantic City, a slaveless Confederate plantation, a Caribbean island without turmoil.
But there is a bottom-line reality at work: Here, even the losers get to go to Disney World.

HEADLINE: Political Notes;
At Times, Campaign Can Be Its Own Opponent

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

 BODY:
Ruth W. Messinger went to a nut-roasting factory at Hunts Point in the Bronx the other day to draw attention to news that the city's unemployment rate had inched up to 10 percent, and to assert that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was doing nothing about it.
So it was a bit of a surprise when Rocco Damato, the president of the A. L. Bazzini Company and the host of her daily campaign event, included the Giuliani administration in his list of government bodies that were instrumental in the company's decision to move his 100-job plant to the Bronx. He had intended to move to North Carolina. 
 "The city has put together a very, very, very aggressive package that if more people knew about, there would be dozens of Bazzinis open," Mr. Damato said as Ms. Messinger, the likely Democratic mayoral candidate, looked on wanly. "I'm saying, 'Hurray for the city, broad-based.' "
It was the kind of event that makes most political campaign managers shudder. For Ms. Messinger, it was the latest in a series of mishaps that have occurred in the three weeks since she began daily campaigning.
The day before her campaign stop at the nut factory (itself the kind of location that most campaigns rigorously avoid, because of the unkind metaphors they invite), Ms. Messinger's aides instructed reporters to contact Robert R. Kiley of the New York City Partnership and Raymond D. Horton of the Citizens Budget Commission for information on her budget plan.
But neither man had been warned that they were about to be enlisted in Ms. Messinger's campaign. And neither was particularly appreciative -- all the more so because Messinger campaign officials gave reporters the numbers of Mr. Horton's summer home and Mr. Kiley's unlisted apartment.
"I'm flabbergasted," Mr. Horton said. Mr. Kiley wouldn't talk to reporters, but issued a terse statement saying: "The campaign office of Ruth Messinger gave out my name and home number without talking to me."
Some Democrats said they were worried about indications of haplessness in Ms. Messinger's campaign. But Ms. Messinger's aides said there was nothing more at play than the growing pains of a quickly expanding organization.
"A challenger is always under examination, especially this early in a race, for mistakes," Leland T. Jones, Ms. Messinger's spokesman, said. "And I think when they make a tiny mistake sometimes, they tend to get a lot of attention."
 
New, but Familiar
Four years ago, Mr. Giuliani's campaign protested when the Metropolitan Transportation Authority used radio advertisements in which Mayor David N. Dinkins took credit for keeping fares down. The advertising campaign "undermines the integrity of the Public Campaign Finance law," Peter J. Powers, Mr. Giuliani's campaign manager, wrote in a protest to the Campaign Finance Board in 1993.
Times have changed. On Thursday, Mr. Giuliani showed up with a transportation authority camera crew at the subway stop at 53d Street and Lexington Avenue to promote the use of the Metrocard. It was the second instance in which publicly financed advertisements will allow Mr. Giuliani to promote the card and the change which now allows users a free transfer between bus and subway. In this case, Mr. Giuliani will probably share a spot in the authority's advertisements with Claire Shulman, the Queens Borough President, a popular Democrat who is considering endorsing Mr. Giuliani this fall.
What has changed since Mr. Powers wrote his letter saying such expenditures subverted the campaign finance laws, and urging the board to count them against Mr. Dinkins's campaign spending limits? The Campaign Finance Board ruled against Mr. Giuliani then, and the Mayor's aides said yesterday that he now felt entitled to do what his predecessor had done. "The guidelines that applied to the former Mayor, as established by the board, also apply to this campaign," said Sunny Mindel, the Mayor's campaign spokesman.
Randy M. Mastro, a deputy mayor, said the Mayor appeared at the invitation of the authority. He said he did not know the total cost of the advertising campaign but that it was a legitimate expenditure of public funds because it was "educational." In the ads, the Mayor instructs riders how they need to buy a Metrocard to take advantage of the new one-fare policy.
Mr. Jones, Ms. Messinger's spokesman, had a different view. "It's an extremely inappropriate use of public funds in a campaign year," he said. "He is basically ripping off taxpayers to run for re-election."
For the record: Notwithstanding Mr. Giuliani's appearance before the cameras, he neither has a Metrocard nor needs one. The Mayor, for security reasons, does not generally use the city's buses and subways.
 
Messinger Gets Funds
 Ms. Messinger received some good news last week as the Campaign Finance Board awarded her public funds matching her private funds. Ms. Messinger got a check for $1.1 million, part of $2.2 million given to 27 candidates. Mayoral candidates who apply for matching funds have to raise a minimum of $250,0000 from 1,000 city residents. Neither of Ms. Messinger's Democratic opponents, Councilman Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn and the Rev. Al Sharpton, has reached the threshold yet.
Under the program, which is voluntary, the city matches contributions up to $1,000 from city residents. Since Mr. Giuliani does not have a primary, he did not receive a check now, but will in the general election.

HEADLINE: Clinton Vows to Double Federal Money to Preserve Lake Tahoe

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: INCLINE VILLAGE, Nev., July 26

 BODY:
From a research boat on the cobalt-blue waters of Lake Tahoe today, President Clinton watched scientists test the quality of that water and then pledged to double over the next two years the Federal investment in measures to halt the degradation of North America's largest alpine lake.
Mr. Clinton's visit to the 250-square-mile lake in the Sierra Nevada was his second event this week devoted to environmental issues. It was part of an Administration push to showcase efforts that unite environmentalists and business, in this case to insure that the lake, which straddles the California-Nevada border, will not lose its trademark clarity because of soil runoff and boat pollution feeding algae. 
 "One of the reasons I wanted to come here was not only to highlight to the nation the importance of Lake Tahoe," Mr. Clinton said, "but also to show the nation that there is a place where environmentalists and business people and ordinary citizens, where Republicans and Democrats, where tribal leaders and governmental people, where everybody is working together in common cause.
"We cannot divide our quest for prosperity from our obligation to hand nature -- God's great gift to us -- on down through the generations."
Besides riding the research boat, the President signed an executive order committing the Government to actions to save the lake and participated in two hours of discussions moderated by Vice President Al Gore. Mr. Gore, who had come to the area a day earlier, was clearly involved in one of his favorite issues and was also following Mr. Clinton's tradition of lavishing attention on causes important to California, a crucial electoral state.
"When I saw the Vice President this morning he was virtually glowing, and I knew he had been here in his element," Mr. Clinton joked to those gathered for the discussion session. "And the minute we got on the boat I got my Marine Biology 101 lecture about phosphorous, nitrogen, what does what, what does the other."
Mr. Gore himself said, "Lake Tahoe demonstrates clearly that the economy is the environment and the environment is the economy."
Celebrated by Mark Twain a century ago as "the fairest picture the whole earth affords," Lake Tahoe has been losing its legendary clarity by more than a foot a year because of local development. Scientists say that without remedial measures the lake has less than 30 years before it turns gray-green.
Twenty million visitors a year come to the Tahoe basin for skiing and hiking, for gambling and for the lake. Last month the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, a joint California-Nevada authority that regulates regional development, voted to ban jet skis starting in 1999. The agency also has compiled a list of reclamation projects expected to cost nearly $1 billion over more than a decade. Officials are hoping that the Federal Government will pick up about $300 million of those costs.
Mr. Clinton made a down payment today, saying that over the next two years the Federal Government would spend $26.6 million on projects to preserve the region, above the $12 million a year that the Government has already been spending here.
Two of the envisioned Federal projects require action by Congress: the allocation of $7 million for a pipeline to carry waste water out of the Tahoe basin and $1.5 million to create a transit center where people would leave their cars and ride shuttle buses to reduce traffic congestion and pollution.

HEADLINE: When Healing Collides With the Drive for Profits

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON 

 BODY:
Behind the resignation on Friday of the top executive of Columbia/ HCA, the world's largest health care company, lie the same pressures to satisfy Wall Street that have confounded other for-profit hospital chains.
The executive, Richard L. Scott, has been the most visible proponent of the philosophy behind for-profit hospitals -- that healthy patients and healthy profits do not conflict. In less than a decade, he built Columbia into a $20 billion company with about 350 hospitals and hundreds of other treatment centers. 
 But Federal investigators are now asking whether the Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation achieved its profits partly through fraud -- by overstating their expenses to increase their compensation from Federal programs like Medicare, for example, and by regularly conducting unnecessary blood tests. Mr. Scott's grudging responses apparently contributed to his downfall.
In some ways, the profit-driven companies like Columbia have set higher standards in how hospitals operate, cutting costs with greater buying power and leaner bureaucracies. Many administrators at not-for-profit hospitals agree that their for-profit competitors have forced them to become far more efficient.
Some for-profit hospital companies have prospered without a hint of impropriety. But their greater challenge is generating profits in a business where the Government and private employers limit their payments and where not-for-profit competitors have joined together -- to buy supplies, for example -- to achieve the same economies of scale.
"On virtually every single study, there are no cost differences between the profits and the nonprofits," said Gerard Anderson, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Hospital Finance and Management in Baltimore. The investor-owned chains are left in an ethical quandary, he said. "In order to generate substantial profit margins," he said, "they need to take some liberties."
Columbia is only the latest example of a for-profit hospital chain that has run into legal or financial woes in its efforts to provide shareholders with returns more common to the makers of software or soda water.
In 1993, National Medical Enterprises and its psychiatric hospitals were accused by the Government of bribing doctors for their patients, taking in patients who did not need treatment and then keeping them against their will until their insurance ran out. National Medical's successor company, renamed the Tenet Healthcare Corporation and now the nation's second-largest hospital chain, paid $379 million to settle the Federal accusations. Tenet has in recent days been negotiating to merge with Columbia.
The Humana Corporation, the most daring chain before the rise of Columbia, faced patient lawsuits and Federal and state inquiries into its pricing and billing: among other items, $7 Tylenol tablets and $5,000 in charges for an operation that cost the company about $1,200. Columbia later absorbed Humana's hospitals.
Several other hospital chains were forced into bankruptcy or mergers in the late 1980's after they built too many hospitals or failed to adapt to lower Medicare payments.
The pursuit of higher revenue has also affected not-for-profit hospitals, which make up 85 percent of the nation's total. The competitive new world of health care has led some of the most vaunted not-for-profit institutions to break the law, too. Over the last year, the Government has broadly investigated the nation's largest teaching hospitals to determine whether they have fraudulently double-billed Medicare for certain services. Already, two teaching hospitals in Pennsylvania have agreed to pay more than $40 million to settle charges of fraud.
The investor-owned chains argue that only they have the financial discipline to cut costs and raise efficiency, themes that play well in the battle against medical inflation. But charity hospitals can do as well. In Houston, Dr. Denton A. Cooley's Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke's Episcopal Hospital does heart bypasses for about a third less than most other hospitals, with healthier outcomes as well.
Some experts wonder how long Columbia can keep up its performance no matter what its tactics. The company, said Jeff Goldsmith, a health care consultant, has had to keep buying hospitals at bargain prices to maintain its profit margins and its appeal to investors. Even though the company's stock has fallen from its peak, investors still value it at about $25 billion.
But the hospital chains, including some not-for-profit groups, have a tough time squeezing higher surpluses, from their hospitals year after year. Saving money through bulk ordering of bandages is one thing, but saving through cuts in hospital staffs and procedural shortcuts has clear limits. "These institutions are vastly more complicated than any business," Mr. Goldsmith said. "You are literally custom-making a product for everyone who comes in."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Health Care Consolidation"
When Richard L. Scott entered the hospital business in 1987, he faced a fragmented field of often-troubled competitors. Today, the greater part of the for-profit hospital world has been consolidated under his company, the Columbina/HCA Healthcare Corporation. Even the largest competitor, Tenet Healthcare, has been in merger negotiations with Columbia. The chart shows how the number of Healthcare companies has diminished through mergers since the 1980's, with Columbia/HCA totally dominating the field at the present time.

HEADLINE: BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE -- A Special Report;
Questions of Race Run Deep for Foe of Preferences

BYLINE: By BARRY BEARAK 

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

 BODY:
By society's measure, he emerged black from the gene pool, a peculiar arithmetic that Ward Connerly insists he has never understood.
"One drop of blood does it," he said, reviewing the computation: 25 percent black plus 37.5 percent Irish plus 25 percent French plus 12.5 percent Choctaw equals 100 percent black. "I suppose I could claim to be Irish, but who wants to stand there and argue the point every time? So I'm black." 
 Cocoa-brown skin is the product of his amalgamated ancestry. And however much a hindrance the color may have been in other endeavors, it now offers him a paradoxical advantage, for Mr. Connerly has become the nation's most active opponent of racial preferences. His blackness, he agrees with some reluctance, grants many whites a kind of absolution, allowing them to protest affirmative action "without having to feel like they appear racist."
Wardell Anthony Connerly, 58, a millionaire businessman with the oratorical gallop of an evangelist, is the man who successfully led the challenge against California's racial bookkeeping, first in his position as a regent in the university system, then as head of last year's statewide ballot measure -- Proposition 209 -- that banned state and local governments from using racial and sexual preferences in hiring, contracting and college admissions.
Now Mr. Connerly has taken his crusade nationwide, pushing for similar referendums in other states and for a bill in Congress.
But while he deals boldly and directly with his cause, he has kept a psychic distance from his roots. Whatever the impact on his current beliefs, Mr. Connerly grew up in an extended family whose secrets seem to leap from the pages of Faulkner. Although his story may not suggest any new answers regarding the rights and wrongs of affirmative action, it does offer compelling insight into the difficult subject of race in America..
All his life, Mr. Connerly has mistakenly believed he was rejected by his black father. He was reared by his mother's side of the family in a milieu not uncommon to their Louisiana beginnings. Some of his relatives appraised social status by gradations of color, the lighter the better. Deep racial hurts have never been spoken of, wives to husbands, mothers to sons and daughters.
Mr. Connerly considers himself black "because blackness is an experience and others have thrust that experience upon me." He, on the other hand, claims to be not only blind to pigment but a celebrator of the continuous blending in the melting pot. "In 10 to 15 years, intermarriage will make this entire debate a moot one, anyhow, and we'll wonder why we didn't see it coming," he said.
His political efforts come at a time when the courts have already been paring the parameters of affirmative action -- and even many of its defenders believe course corrections are in order. President Clinton has labeled his own approach "mend it, don't end it."
Mr. Connerly's slogan could well be "nix it, don't fix it." He wants to set aside the bulky, contested ledger on America's racial debits and credits.
"You can't un-ring the bell on slavery," he said. "All you can do is make sure the next person who walks through the door, white or black, receives equal treatment."
Given such views, Mr. Connerly finds himself both rousingly cheered for his courage and jeered for his collaboration, a smart cookie to some, a disloyal Oreo to others. Newspaper cartoonists are fond of placing him beside allies in Klan robes. Outside of movie stars, his face has become one of the best known in California.
While most of the changes here have yet to take effect -- and others are tied up in court -- the momentousness of the upheaval is already evident: after the law school at the University of California at Berkeley was forced to stop using racial preferences, only 14 black students were selected among 792 admissions for the fall. Not one of the blacks has chosen to enroll.
"That's the bad news, yes," Mr. Connerly said. "But no one talks about the good news, that 14 black students were admissible and, if they had chosen to attend, no one would have questioned their right to be there."
He is a courtly man who speaks in gusts, airing his ideas in resonant sentences. His sport coat stays buttoned in 100-degree heat, a folded white hanky peeking from its front pocket. His body is plump, his head balding. His eyes are framed by deep bags at the bottom and bushy brows at the top. Extravagantly patriotic, he claims that each day he silently recites -- 6 or 10 times -- the Pledge of Allegiance and the opening lines of the Declaration of Independence.
By his reckoning, some form of affirmative action was justifiable in the lingering days of Jim Crow 30 years ago. But then the remedy, "like an overused antibiotic, became counterproductive." America had the contaminant of discrimination under control by the early 1980's, he has concluded.
He offered estimates. In multiethnic California, "we're at a 9 or a 10 with 10 being the best," he said.
"In other states," he said, "things are probably at a 7 or 8. I'm not sure a Mississippi is at the same point as a California."
Time is of the essence. In 30 years of affirmative action, Mr. Connerly said, blacks have paid a terrible price for preferential treatment, bartering away their self-esteem and the regard of others. "If you're lying on a gurney and a black doctor shows up, you're going to get up and crawl out," he said. Preferences "make every black doctor and lawyer live under a cloud."
As a university regent, Mr. Connerly gets sheaves of reports. One item that recently caught his eye concerned average scores on the SAT, showing that blacks whose parents earned more than $60,000 a year were outscored by whites and Asian-Americans whose families earned $20,000 or less.
"You hear that black kids need a preference because there's no one encouraging them to go to college," he said. "Well, these upper-income kids have parents who are doctors, lawyers, professors, so you can't conclude the problem is at home. I don't rule out the impact of K-through-12 education, but I think it's exaggerated. These Asian kids are going to the same schools as Latinos and blacks and outperforming them. It's time we got a handle on why middle-class black kids from the suburbs are losing out to low-income Asians from the inner city."
Mr. Connerly has read some of the literature on the subject. The answer that seems most plausible to him comes from the psychologist Claude M. Steele, who developed the idea of "stereotype vulnerability." Black students, Mr. Steele says, are overwhelmed by fear of living up to negative ideas about their race, stripping them of confidence.
"Black kids don't go into an athletic competition thinking they're going to lose," Mr. Connerly said. "They save those feelings of inferiority for the classroom. And do you know what reinforces the idea that they're inferior? Being told they need a preference to succeed."
 
His Background
Disputed Memories In Obscured Past
"If I can make it, anyone can," Mr. Connerly has repeatedly said, his customary opener to Horatio Alger-like details of a humble boyhood.
He was born on June 15, 1939, in the west Louisiana town of Leesville, about 20 miles from the Texas border. His father was part black and part Irish, his mother a medley of Choctaw, Irish and French. When Wardell, as he was then called, was only 2, his father, Roy Connerly, left. "He ran out on us," Ward Connerly said. "We never heard from him again." His mother died two years later of a brain tumor.
Wardell went to live with his widowed maternal grandmother, Mary Soniea (pronounced sun-EE-ay), a religious woman, part Irish, part Choctaw, who had freckles afloat in her reddish skin. Her husband had been Cajun, descended from the French immigrants who had settled in Louisiana. Mrs. Soniea had become the family matriarch and owner of a diner and bar on Havana Street in Leesville.
But the matter of who would rear the boy was far from settled. While the Sonieas told Wardell that his father had abandoned him and disappeared, Roy Connerly actually pursued custody zealously. To make sure the child would always stay in their family, Mrs. Soniea sent Wardell out west with her daughter and her son-in-law, Bertha and James Louis, another black man. The couple settled in a poor, primarily black section of Sacramento, Calif.
The Louises were relatively well-off, with their own home and enough money to sometimes give young Wardell a $5 bill for spending money. Mr. Louis, an unlettered man, stacked lumber for a living. He became a role model to his orphaned nephew. "Uncle James had three rules: My shoes had to be shined, the lawn had to be mowed, the car had to be clean," Mr. Connerly recalled with retroactive approval. "He taught me to have pride in myself."
Over time, most of Mary Soniea's children came to settle in Sacramento, and she eventually followed. She built a two-bedroom house for herself and her grandson. She wanted Wardell back. He moved in with her when he was 12.
"Economically, my life went from riches to rags, well, not riches, but from a middle-class life by black standards, with an allowance every Saturday, to one with a single parent who had spent every penny she had on a house and had a mortgage of $35 a month, which she couldn't always meet," Mr. Connerly said.
His description of their poverty is textured with doleful anecdotes: the many mealtimes when they had nothing to eat but sweet potatoes; the day he had to slide cardboard into his shoe to cover a hole in the sole; the time his proud grandmother had to accept money from her church's Poor Folks Fund, only to then suffer the further indignity of applying for public assistance. In every story, he portrays Mary Soniea, who died in 1977, as loving, wise and fair-minded.
But some of Mr. Connerly's relatives in Sacramento, most of them estranged, challenge these depictions of adversity. "Wardell was the little prince of the family because everyone felt sorry for him," said Elizabeth Stansberry, his cousin. "He lived in a nice, carpeted house. They always had meat. My grandmother kept tea cakes out on a platter. She bought French provincial furniture at Breuner's."
Arthur Soniea, Mr. Connerly's codgerly and irascible 75-year-old uncle, said: "That's malarkey about him stuffing paper in his shoes. Another damned lie is that sweet potatoes three times a day. He don't come around here, but if he did," Mr. Soniea said, he would haul his nephew into the woodshed .
William Lee, a newspaper publisher and close friend of Mr. Connerly's since their youth, said: "It upsets me sometimes when Ward plays to his audience. His portrayal of his childhood is very much exaggerated."
However one adds up the sweet potatoes, no one claims that Mr. Connerly grew up in velvet britches, just that his circumstances were difficult but not dire.
More intriguing, though, are recollections by neighbors and relatives of Mary Soniea as a woman with color-stratified prejudices. These memories vary in implication.
"She was well-respected and cared a lot about Ward, but part of that was to keep him away from the bad element and, to her, that more or less meant black," said Willie Hausey, who ran a neighborhood store.
Ms. Stansberry and another cousin, Grace Haynes, go much further, saying that Ward Connerly was reared by an out-and-out bigot, that their late grandmother was openly scornful of black people, including those married to five of her six children.
"Maybe that's why Ward decided to be as much of a white boy as he could," Ms. Stansberry said. "That's the way he was, you know. We'd play cowboys and Indians. He was always the cowboy and we had to turn up dead."
She said Mr. Connerly had tried to create his own past. "Isn't that what this campaign against affirmative action is all about, so Wardell can bring down black people and forget his own blackness?" she asked.
Ms. Haynes agreed with these comments, adding that her grandmother freely used racial slurs like "jigaboo" and "baboon." Other family members also recalled these verbal slights and worse.
Yvonne Soniea, Grace Haynes's elderly mother and Ward Connerly's aunt, refused several requests for an interview before finally answering some questions. Old wounds left by her mother-in-law's barbed tongue still hurt. In the telling, she broke down inconsolably. "I never wanted others in the family to know these things," she said. "These were secrets."
Her mother-in-law, Yvonne Soniea said, tried to prevent her from marrying into the family. "I'm not dark, but I'm definitely African-American," Yvonne said. "She told me I'd have black babies and she didn't want them around."
After the marriage, Yvonne said, when she did get pregnant, her mother-in-law walked out to a trash bin, contemptuously remarking, "When you have that little dark cub, you put it right here in the garbage."
Ruthless schemes were used to pry her husband away, she said; her mother-in-law encouraged him into a relationship with a white woman. This led, she said, to the couple's divorce, which lasted several months, before they remarried.
Upon hearing some of the condemnations of his beloved grandmother, Mr. Connerly grew teary-eyed and cross, dismissing them all as implausible. He mentioned family rivalries. "These people feel I've neglected them because I don't come around," he said. "My grandmother had dark skin herself."
For corroboration, Mr. Connerly suggested his 81-year-old Aunt Bertha, who did indeed back him up. "If my mother didn't like black people, why'd so many of them come to her house?" Mrs. Louis said. "Who else was there in the neighborhood but black people? The people in her church were black, some of them black as pitch."
She assessed the credibility of her kinfolk: "My brother Arthur is the biggest liar who ever lived, and those others are nothing but dogs. It's plain hatred and jealousy, I'm telling you. Wardell did eat all them sweet potatoes, and I saw that hole in his shoe myself, back in 1959, may God strike me dead."
Even excavating layers of family resentments might fail to explain such contradictions. But there are also verifiable facts buried deep down, quite intentionally hidden from a young boy.
Roy Connerly, gone from his son Ward's life for 56 years and thought most likely to be dead, is actually alive in Leesville. Unbeknown to his firstborn, he remarried, fathered two more sons and spent a lifetime in menial toil.
Ward Connerly was given the news by telephone. "I did not know," he responded sharply. "I've had no contact with him."
He paused a few seconds, then, rather formally, as if issuing a statement, said, "The fact that he's alive is news to me. It does not surprise me or delight me or disturb me. It's just news."
Moments later, his voice softened with curiosity: "He left my mother. Why didn't he ever try to reach me?"
The elder Connerly is 84 and bed-ridden, a stroke victim who suffers from crippling arthritis. With his mental faculties gone dim, he is unable to rebut the Soniea version of his marital breakup, which paints him as a carouser and a drunk and a wife-beater. It is the only account Ward Connerly has ever heard.
But Clementine Connerly, Roy's current wife, spoke up in his behalf with decidedly different particulars. "Roy was too black for the Sonieas; they was a high yellow people," said Mrs. Connerly, 62. "Grace was Roy's first wife's name. Her mother didn't want them to marry and she wouldn't stop till she busted them up.
"When Grace died, my husband went all the way to the Supreme Court in New Orleans to get custody away from Wardell's grandmother. Roy used to call him Billy Boy. Then, years later, Wardell's uncle came through here and said the boy was being raised white or Indian and he didn't want anything to do with us."
Louis Connerly, 45, a handyman and one of the two half brothers Ward has never met, said, "My father always told me it was more or less a race thing. In Louisiana, at a certain time, if you had a certain amount of white blood, you were inclined to think you were better than the next person."
He added, "My dad wanted Billy Boy. And so did my dad's mother, Fannie Connerly. You know, we all wish Wardell well. We've seen him on TV. I've got his rifle. A long time ago, my dad gave me a single shot .22. 'To my son, Billy Boy' is engraved on the stock."
Ward Connerly, hit out-of-the-blue by the details, held tightly to his bitterness toward his father. "I'm interested that he had a stroke," he said. "I've wondered about that. I've read that strokes are hereditary."
 
His Rise to Success
Moving Easily In a White World
Mr. Connerly said he can remember being called "nigger" just once while growing up. He was in the second or third grade, walking in a white neighborhood. He picked a walnut off the sidewalk. "I caught you, you little nigger, stealing my walnuts," a man shouted. Ward was rescued by his white playmate, Mildred Tittle, who said, "Don't you say that or I'll tell my father!"
Mr. Connerly has a trove of similar stories about white people who helped him, a bus driver, a store owner, teachers: "I've always been someone who people would notice and say, 'This kid is trying to make it.' "
That was certainly true in college. At Sacramento State University, where he graduated in 1962, Mr. Connerly was one of about 50 blacks on a campus of 2,000. He was elected vice president of the student body, then president. He was eagerly recruited by fraternities, pledging all-white Delta Phi Omega.
"It was very chic to have a good-looking black around," recalled Adolphus McGee, then a black football star on campus. "Ward was Joe College, Mr. Personality. Understand, those times were pre-militance, pre-dashikis."
Mr. Connerly was a Young Democrat back then. He was also the leader of the student committee against discrimination in housing. The group sent black "testers" into white neighborhoods, identifying biased landlords.
Soon after graduation, Mr. Connerly's thinking took a turn to the right. "I had always been a great believer in free enterprise," he explained. The conservative ideas of Barry Goldwater were winning him over, about the time many others were raising clenched fists in salute to black power.
"This reveling in blackness -- black is beautiful, black power, black consciousness -- just creates an invisible wall of difference that sets us apart," Mr. Connerly said. "While others are assimilating, blacks are getting further and further away from one nation indivisible.
" Black solidarity has led to a black agenda and a demand for black loyalty. If you don't believe in it, you're a sellout, an Uncle Tom, a traitor."
Two months after graduation, Mr. Connerly married Ilene Crews, a white student he had been dating for about a year. The vows were exchanged in a minister's living room before only two witnesses.
At first, neither family approved, Mr. Connerly said. He recalled that his grandmother preferred a bride of mulatto shading. "Can't you find a nice colored girl?" she asked.
Ilene's parents "had very pronounced reservations, and for a couple of years or so, they stayed in their world and we stayed in ours," Mr. Connerly said. "It's funny. The thing that makes parents the most fearful about an interracial marriage is the grandkids. What will they look like? What will they have to face? But when it happens, that's what brings you back together. They've got a grandchild and they see he's beautiful."
Even with a diploma and a dedication to free enterprise, Mr. Connerly at first did not consider a business career. He said he was "too conditioned" by his blackness.
"You had this notion back in the 60's that if you were black, and you had a college degree, you went into government," he said.
He joined the State Department of Housing and Community Development, becoming its liaison to the Legislature. There he met a political up-and-comer, Representative Pete Wilson, a man of remarkable energy who seemed to exhale ambition. Mr. Wilson recruited Mr. Connerly to a staff job on the Assembly's housing committee. A close friendship was knit.
Mr. Wilson went on to become the Mayor of San Diego, a United States Senator and then, in 1991, the Governor, while Mr. Connerly became a sought-after consultant in Sacramento, advising local governments how to comply with state land-use laws, many of which he had helped write. Some work came his way because of his blackness, as public officials tried to fulfill the mandates of affirmative action. But Mr. Connerly's success owes far more to satisfied clients and political connections.
A generous contributor to Mr. Wilson's campaigns, Mr. Connerly was offered various jobs in his friend's administration, accepting the post of regent only after being assured that it would not require much time.
Instead, the position has nearly taken over his life, filling it with new purpose while emptying it of tranquillity. Racial preferences had been of only passing interest to him before. But suddenly the subject was consuming, offending Mr. Connerly's idea of fairness. In the summer of 1994, two white parents had paid him a visit after their son was refused a spot in medical school. The father, Jerry Cook, was a statistician. His look at the admissions records led him to think his son had fallen to the bottom of a racially stacked deck.
Mr. Connerly ordered a review of university admissions data and concluded that race had assumed too important a part in the process. Blacks and Hispanic-Americans were accepted ahead of whites and Asian-Americans who had far better grades and test scores. In 1994, the average high school grade point of freshman admissions, with 4 equivalent to an A, was 3.75 for Asian-Americans, 3.69 for whites, 3.50 for Hispanic-Americans, 3.40 for Mexican-Americans (who are counted in a separate category) and 3.24 for blacks.
Racism does "not justify our government giving a preference to Jose over Chang because Susan's father discriminated against Willie's father 50 years ago," Mr. Connerly said, summing up his thoughts.
Debate began. Professors and administrators generally argued that the system of preferences was sacrosanct, defending it with the customary arguments for diversity. They often spoke in jargon, with positions that could be paradoxical.
David A. Hollinger, a history professor at the Berkeley campus and supporter of affirmative action, watched the debate with chagrin. For years, there had been "a tacit agreement not to ask hard questions" about affirmative action, Professor Hollinger said. Then, when the time came to defend it, he said, partisans were ill-prepared. Indeed, they had their own unresolved conflicts, which made their side all the more vulnerable to an attack like Mr. Connerly's.
Some believed in affirmative action to promote cultural diversity; others found absurd the assumption that culture follows blood. Some thought nonwhite skin color an inescapable burden in a biased society; others asked why the children of wealthy blacks or newly arrived immigrants were favored over the children of poor whites. Some said the program ought to be limited to black Americans burdened by the legacy of slavery; others said Hispanic-Americans should be included, pointing to the conquest of Mexico in 1848 and United States imperialism since the Monroe Doctrine.
Mr. Connerly's crusade was soon joined by Governor Wilson. Actually a longtime advocate of affirmative action, Mr. Wilson had relocated his views into the Republican mainstream just as he announced a bid for the party's Presidential nomination.
On July 21, 1995, with Mr. Wilson in rare attendance, the Board of Regents voted 14 to 10 to scrap its 30-year-old policy of preferences for minorities and women. These meetings are usually staid, but this one had protesters in full roar. Among those present was the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who would later call Mr. Connerly a "house slave" and a "puppet of the white man."
 
His Cause
Claiming Victory Over Preferences
Mr. Connerly continues to obey the three rules of his late Uncle James. His car, a Jaguar, glistens; the grounds around his home and pool are immaculate; his shoes are shined. But these tasks no longer require his own labor. His shoes are cared for by a man with a stand in the parking garage of a private club he frequents. Mr. Connerly does not know this older man's name, but he considers him "one of the brightest, best-read people I know."
And therein, Mr. Connerly said he realizes, is a dilemma.
"The reason this man shines shoes is because he's black," he said. "There's no disgrace in that, but I know that in another time and in another place, this man would not be a shoeshine man. How do we make it up to him?"
Such confounding questions played virtually no part in the debate over Proposition 209. The referendum question, carefully worded as an anti-preferences measure to guarantee civil rights, was a political brush fire with $3.6 million to burn. On Nov. 5, 1996, 15 months after the Regents' vote, Mr. Connerly gave a victory speech before an overwhelmingly white crowd, wowing them as usual with his aphoristic, all-American locutions.
Asking his audience to "indulge" him, he asked to have "a personal conversation with my fellow black Americans," although only a few were in the room. "Those who followed before you had to climb steep mountains of oppression," he lectured. "Surely, you can travel the freeways of opportunity without special consideration based on the color of your skin."
The 209 effort had been started by two white male scholars who had the opinion polls on their side and most everything else against them. To place the question on the ballot meant getting 700,000 names on petitions, a laborious process for which hired workers were paid as much as $1 a signature. By November 1995 the campaign was broke, but, after an 11-month courtship, its leaders finally persuaded Mr. Connerly to take over.
His involvement was decisive. One reason was that Mr. Connerly was able to bring in money. According to an internal campaign memorandum, Mr. Connerly had refused to come aboard "without assurances from Wilson that the initiative will succeed," which, those involved said, meant that the California Republican Party would pay the way. A second reason was that he was black. Other memorandums show that leaders of the 209 effort had a calculated preference for women and minorities in top positions.
"It was like using affirmative action to defeat affirmative action," said Joe C. Gelman, the campaign manager when Mr. Connerly was brought aboard. "We were being pretty cynical, I have to admit."
Race confronted Mr. Connerly every day on the street. Blacks rushed up to him, saying he had ruined their lives. Whites thanked him for being on their side. "I'm not on anybody's side," he would respond.
Two months after the Proposition 209 victory, on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, Mr. Connerly announced the start of the American Civil Rights Institute, an outfit with a two-person staff that would try to kindle the brush fire beyond California. So far, only campaigns in Washington State and Houston seem to have heated up.
Mr. Connerly has also tried to enlist the Republican national leadership, urging Speaker Newt Gingrich to move on an anti-affirmative action bill. But the party is ideologically split over the issue. Besides, the matter involves not only minorities but women, and last year's elections showed that Republicans were already having enough trouble with women.
In arguing "mend it, don't end it," President Clinton has pointed out that the unemployment rate for blacks is still about double that of whites. The Hispanic rate is even higher. The average income for a college-educated Hispanic woman is less than that of a white male with only a high school diploma.
But even if this were so, Ward Connerly asked, is it right to discriminate against a white man to fix it?
Last month, Mr. Gingrich and Mr. Connerly's names were atop an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, rebutting the President. The article called racial preferences "a national human catastrophe," then let fly with a volley of broadsides at "the failed Great Society," an attack that made Mr. Connerly wince.
"Gingrich's staff people wrote it, and I didn't get to see a draft until the last minute," he said, deftly accepting and deflecting responsibility. "It's under my name and I'll stand behind it, but I only got to make minor changes to the anti-liberal rhetoric. I'm no liberal, but I don't think it serves conservatives well to go on and on about the Great Society."
Mr. Connerly's private reflections are rarely as unambiguous as his public pronouncements. Before audiences, he shies away from complexities. In private, his views are more elastic.
Thinking out loud, he often twists himself into contradictions, his thoughts especially entangled when it comes to proposing remedies for large-scale discrimination. Once, he suggested class-action suits as an approach, another time "the collective nah-nah-nah of the marketplace."
Most of Mr. Connerly's arguments apply to skilled jobs where merit can be put to some measurement. But if racial disparity is shown in the hiring of unskilled workers, he said, "I'll be the first person to admit I don't know what the hell to do."
"You almost have to look at how race was taken into account" in such cases, he said. "The position I'm coming to is that it's O.K. to monitor with numbers."
But the fear of showing unbalanced numbers to government monitors has, in the past, led employers to play it safe by using preferences and quotas.
Mr. Connerly has things just about half right, said Eddie Hall, the man who shines his shoes: Hard work, not affirmative action, is the answer. But insofar as society ever becoming color-blind, "That's utopia and there's no such thing."
Mr. Hall, 72, is a man with a gray beard who looks at his buff cloths through bifocals. He has watched his own dreams diminish and then disappear. Think of it, he laughed, he once thought a poor black like himself could go to college and be a doctor.
Instead, never able to get any kind of good-paying job, he became one of those blacks who "are resigned that in the eyes of God we must work in the pit." A man of good temper, Mr. Hall thought of a wry way to explain the only affirmative action he had ever known.
Time after time, employers turned him away after they saw his black skin.
"It was a-firm-ative action," he wisecracked. "They were very firm."
Five days after learning that his father was alive, and after hard thinking about confused feelings, Ward Connerly telephoned Louisiana. "This all leaves me shaking," he said after hanging up. "I can't believe I'm using words like 'my father' and 'my brothers.' He acknowledged that he probably was not told the truth about his father's desire to rear him.
During the phone call, Mr. Connerly mostly talked to Clementine, the wife of his addled father. Then, for a short time, he said, she put the receiver up to her invalid husband's ear. Before he lapsed back into a muddle, a small spark lighted within.
"Who is this?" the old man asked.
"This is Wardell."
"Billy?"
"Yes, your son."
"Billy, when you coming back this way?"

HEADLINE: Mayor Vows to Veto Coliseum Sale, Citing Long-Term Issues

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani threatened yesterday to block a plan by a state agency to sell the New York Coliseum, one of the most valuable parcels of real estate in New York City, saying that the agency was focusing too much on immediately profiting from the project and not enough on the long-term economic benefits and architectural merits of the proposals for the site.
Mr. Giuliani, who has veto power over the project, said he would demand extensive revisions in a tentative deal between the agency and a developer before he granted his approval for any new building on the site, which anchors Columbus Circle. 
 The deal by the agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, is not yet final, but Mr. Giuliani said he was disturbed by the news that the authority appears to have settled upon the developer, Millennium Partners, in large part because of a highly unusual financial concession that the developer offered.
The authority had hoped to approve the sale on Wednesday, but the Mayor said he would not allow that. Mr. Giuliani's vow indicates that the long-delayed effort to revamp the Coliseum site, which has been the subject of some of the most celebrated and contentious development battles in the city's recent history, has hit another snag.
At a news conference yesterday and in an interview afterward, Mr. Giuliani lashed out at the authority and said he would set up his own panel to evaluate the esthetics and economic benefits of the designs and proposed uses offered by the five finalists in the competition held by the authority to choose a developer.
"The M.T.A. has really no concern for the future of the city," the Mayor said. "All they are concerned about is how much they make." The Mayor added, "They are going to have to make a lot of changes in order for me to be satisfied."
The dispute that arose yesterday was not really about esthetics or architectural style, because the Giuliani administration has not expressed strong opposition on those grounds to Millennium's proposal. It appears instead to stem from a disagreement over the pace of the selection process -- and what kind of buildings will be on the site.
Giuliani administration officials maintained that the Mayor had privately told the authority in recent weeks that he wanted the winning developer to build a 1,000- to 2,000-seat theater on the site that would link it to Lincoln Center, which is a few blocks to the northwest. None of the finalists have yet incorporated such a structure in their plans.
The officials said the Mayor decided to criticize the authority publicly yesterday after he began to feel that it was ignoring his request and rushing the deal.
Besides the theater, though, the officials would not say what other revisions the Mayor wanted in the proposed agreement with Millennium.
That reticence to discuss other changes suggests that the Mayor's primary goal in announcing his criticism yesterday was to counter the perception that he was allowing the project to proceed without adequate consideration for its aesthetic or civic virtues. In other words, even if he generally likes the Millennium proposal, he may not like the appearance that it is being chosen for largely financial reasons.
Asked yesterday about the Mayor's comments, Virgil Conway, the authority's chairman, said, "The Mayor's concerns have to be dealt with. But I would hope that we could do it by Wednesday." Mr. Conway added that the authority had not ignored architectural considerations in choosing a developer.
The developer that is the top pick of the authority, Millennium Partners, has proposed a glass complex for the site that would include a 64-story tower, as well as a convention center, a 1,000-room hotel, condominiums, an entertainment center and a health club.
Perhaps more important, Millennium promised the authority that it would pay more than $300 million for the property even if, as is very likely, the project is entangled in litigation. Millennium Partners was the only one of the nine bidders in the yearlong competition for the site that agreed to pay upon signing a contract, state officials said.
That provision in the deal was so important that it gave Millennium the edge even though it did not make the highest offer for the site, state officials said.
Developers usually withhold full payment on these types of projects until litigation has been resolved. Some neighborhood groups have said they will go to court to stop the project, as they did the last time the authority sought to sell the site, saying the project would be too big for the area.
"Of course that's important," Mr. Conway said of Millennium's promise. "Unconditional offers are always important. The more conditions that you attach to any real estate deal always detract from an offer." Executives at Millennium Partners declined to comment.
The Mayor's attack yesterday reflected longstanding tensions between the two sides over the sale of the site. The authority, a transportation agency that has no interest in acting as a developer, is eager to rid itself of the Coliseum and channel the proceeds from the sale to capital improvements on the subways and commuter railroads.
Officials of the city, which essentially will reap no money from the sale, are more interested in whether the project will revitalize Columbus Circle.
"The M.T.A. mistakenly believed that this was all about money," Randy Levine, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Planning and Administration, said. "We told them that it was never about money, that this was about a series of things, price being only one. The most important thing is the way the project enhances the neighborhood, because New York City has to live with this for the next 50 or 100 years."

HEADLINE: Both Sides Say Accord Is Near On the Budget

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 26

 BODY:
With each side speaking encouragingly of progress, White House and Republican negotiators today made a significant push toward an agreement on tax cuts and a balanced budget.
"It's coming together," said an official involved in the budget discussions who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
 He said the talks had progressed far beyond the rhetoric of the last few days, to the point that Congressional aides had started writing draft legislation on certain issues.
The discussions ended about 6:30 this evening after a full day, and officials said Republican and Democratic staff members would meet on Sunday to work on what they said were small issues. There were no plans for the principals to meet on Sunday.
The Clinton Administration views the negotiations on the tax cut side as a no-lose proposition. [Page 14.]
On Medicare, which is the biggest issue in the budget bill, Administration officials and Congressional leaders said the three most contentious proposals appeared to be off the table, at least temporarily.
Those proposals, approved last month by the Senate, would increase Medicare premiums for the affluent elderly, raise the eligibility age (to 67 from 65) and charge $5 a visit for home health care services.
Senators of both parties have said all three proposals are needed to help keep Medicare solvent for the baby boom generation. And President Clinton said this week that he would support a means test requiring higher premiums for beneficiaries with higher incomes.
But House members of both parties and lobbyists for the elderly have resisted the three proposals, saying they should be referred to an advisory panel that will study Medicare's long-term financial problems.
Gene Sperling, President Clinton's economic policy adviser, said late this afternoon, "A lot of issues have been narrowed on the spending side. But things will not get done tonight."
Senior leaders spent the day shuttling between a series of large meetings and smaller ones -- some on spending, others on tax cuts and still others involving just Republicans and Democrats huddling among themselves to discuss the most recent offers or counteroffers.
Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff, led the Administration's negotiating team, while the Republican side was anchored by Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, backed by the chairmen of their budget and tax-writing committees.
"There really are very few items that have to be resolved," Representative Bill Archer, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told reporters about midday. "If a couple of major items get resolved on the tax bill, the rest of it will all fall in place rapidly."
The tax question has become the linchpin in the talks and the problem in resolving it is as much philosophical as it is fiscal. A central sticking point is whether working families with incomes of $25,000 a year or less will get any benefits from the proposed tax credits for children.
The Republicans argue that many such families pay little or no income tax, so giving them the child tax credits would be a form of welfare. But Democrats counter that those same people have payroll tax deductions and need relief much more than higher income families.
A shrinking circle of negotiators was among the subtle signs today that the sides were moving toward agreement.
For example, it appeared that Mr. Archer, who has been among the most adamant Republicans in insisting on cuts in capital gains taxes and corporate taxes, might have to fight to protect his role in the final negotiating rounds. Mr. Archer's committee is responsible for all tax legislation in the House and for considerable parts of the spending deal because of its authority over Medicare.
Although he was involved when the talks resumed this morning, Mr. Archer said he did not think he would continue to be involved in the portion of the talks dealing with spending.
Asked by reporters whether he would continue to participate in the tax portion of the talks, Mr. Archer said, "We'll see."
In recent days, each side has spoken optimistically of progress in the negotiations, which are focused on cutting taxes, limiting the growth of Government and balancing the Federal budget by 2002.
"We're close to an agreement with the White House that would accomplish all those goals," Mr. Lott said today in the Republican radio address. "But you know the old saying: 'Close, but no cigar.' Any celebration at this point would definitely be premature."
At an appearance on Friday before the National Association of Elementary School Principals in Arlington, Va., President Clinton said: "I think we're going to get this agreement."
The pace of the negotiations is being driven by an effort to have both the budget and tax legislation completed before Congress leaves on Friday for its summer break.
But Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate have argued against making that a deadline.
"There is no artificial deadline," "If it takes until September to do it right, let it be September," Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, said on Friday.
The two sides also resumed negotiations today on other vexing issues: welfare, estate taxes, education tax incentives, tobacco taxes and medical savings accounts.
They settled a major issue, disability benefits for legal immigrants, on Friday.
The Republicans agreed to restore disability benefits to legal immigrants who were in the country last August, when the new welfare bill was signed into law.
The Republicans also agreed to continue Medicaid coverage for tens of thousands of children who face losing it, along with disability benefits, under the new welfare law.
Entwined in the rosy talk about progress were some political barbs.
Mr. Lott complained in his radio address: "I have worked with six Administrations, both Democrats and Republicans. This one, let me tell you, is unique. Its public assertions are often fanciful; its private data are often contrived."

HEADLINE: For Deaf Peddlers, Both Opportunity And Exploitation

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN and IAN FISHER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 26

 BODY:
You can buy practically anything at the wholesale stores on Los Angeles Street: smiling ceramic Buddhas, crates of heart-shaped sunglasses, countless Spanish-language videos of action movies. The deaf peddlers come mostly for key chains.
And among these deaf peddlers who come to the markets to stock up on merchandise, the Paoletti family of Mexico City distinguished itself long before it made headlines in New York. At one storefront bazaar here, the family now accused of having all but enslaved scores of deaf immigrants as street peddlers is known for having ordered its key chains by the thousands of dozens. 
 Yet if the Paolettis were remarkable figures in this silent underworld, it was mostly for the scale of their operations and the extremes to which they are said to have gone in mistreating the men and women they lured from Mexico to Queens.
Since the 1970's, researchers and social service workers say, poor immigrants have largely taken over and transformed a byzantine economy of deaf peddlers, which has its roots in places like Los Angeles Street and extends from shopping centers in Chicago to retirement villages in Florida and Texas.
[On Saturday, Federal investigators arrested two people described as the leaders of a trinket-peddling operation in Chicago similar to the one uncovered in New York last weekend. Page 26.]
But many of the peddlers and several other people who have studied their world described it as much more complex and diverse than the latest news might suggest.
For some of the young recruits, the work is simply a hard way to an honest living, a source of enough income to survive in the United States while pursuing opportunities for schooling or job-training that do not exist in countries like Cambodia or El Salvador. They may work alone or in groups, they say, but their associations are voluntary and their bosses generally fair.
For other deaf peddlers, though, there is nothing new in the stories of exploitation and abuse told by the young Mexicans who worked for the Paolettis. Separated from their families and smuggled into the United States, these immigrants have found themselves at the mercy of their own avaricious masters, "kings" who run their peddlers much as a pimp might run a stable of prostitutes.
"You know how this American dream is," said Esther Lozano, 50, a Mexican woman who was in Los Angeles visiting a family of deaf friends who sell trinkets at shopping malls. "People come here with the hope that they will be able to do what they could not do before -- people who are deaf and people who are not. But all of those people come to suffer. The deaf just suffer more."
Some students of deaf culture said the story of the Paolettis recalled nothing so much as the tale of Leon Krakover, a deaf Chicago entrepreneur who built his street-peddling empire into a corporation complete with lawyers, accountants, a staff of deaf door-to-door salesmen and an apartment hotel to house them.
Mr. Krakover's own flurry of headlines, which followed his expulsion in 1948 from the National Fraternal Society for the Deaf and a $2.5-million lawsuit that he filed in response, delineated a postwar struggle between a deaf underclass and what The Cavalier, a national deaf newspaper of the day, referred to as "the self-respecting deaf."
Members of the latter group saw the peddlers as a mendicant stain on their collective image. But even as access to better schooling and better jobs has led more and more deaf Americans to mark their distance from the ranks of the disabled, the flood of new immigrants from Latin America, Asia and Eastern Europe in the last three decades has replenished the pool of deaf people living in isolation and need.
One man, who gave his name only as Eduardo and said he was a political refugee from Guatemala, was typical of the new work force.
A thin 35-year-old who wears his hair in a short ponytail, Eduardo said he still had nightmares about his experience, and he agreed to speak to a reporter only on the condition that his last name not be printed.
He told of leaving his home in the quiet colonial town of Antigua eight years ago, after both he and his father were threatened for their activities on behalf of opposition political parties.
While living in exile in Mexico, Eduardo said, he met another deaf man in the northern industrial city of Monterrey who told him of lucrative work waiting just across the border in Texas.
Eventually, the man provided Eduardo with false identity papers and led him, along with seven deaf Mexicans, past American immigration agents at the border crossing in Laredo. But almost as soon as the group arrived at a home that the smuggler owned in Natalia, Tex., near San Antonio, Eduardo and the Mexicans were put to work in a regimen very different from what they had imagined.
"We got almost nothing to eat," Eduardo said, speaking through a sign-language interpreter at a special school he attends in Los Angeles. "We had to sell every day, from six in the morning until seven at night. The boss had a very big house, but he did not give us anything."
On Christmas night in 1989, a few visitors arrived for a party at the Natalia home. Sensing a chance to escape, Eduardo said, he hid outside the house until one of the visitors emerged, and then begged the man to take him away. The visitor agreed, but only on the condition that Eduardo trade sex for a plane ticket to Los Angeles. "They were very bad people," Eduardo, who complied, said, breaking down in tears.
Although social service agencies in the United States have expanded their services to the deaf and to immigrants, deaf immigrants are still prone to fall through the cracks.
Some of them arrive knowing only the sign languages of their native countries; some arrive without any sign language at all. Public conveniences that are taken for granted by American-born deaf people -- like telephone links that allow them to communicate by typing -- remain stubborn mysteries. Available jobs stay just out of reach.
The isolation of a life in silence is compounded for those who live in fear of the immigration authorities. Those who have left their families behind have little choice but to depend on small groups of others like themselves. And often, the king peddlers who profit from such vulnerability are deaf themselves.
"In order to recruit these people, to train them and to spread them around to work, you have to be able to sign," said Carol A. Padden, a professor at the University of California at San Diego who studies deaf culture and is deaf herself.
"You have to have an organizer, and typically, that is a deaf person."
The business itself is more intricate than it might appear from the cards that are quietly placed beside customers. Printers offer the cards with a variety of sales pitches -- from "I am deaf . .t." and "I love you" to "Please pardon my intrusion, but I am a deaf person trying to earn for college expenses."
At wholesale emporiums like the ones on Los Angeles Street, the peddlers choose items that are cheap, light and utilitarian: nail-clippers ($4 a dozen) are a favorite, as are pencils and pens (prices vary) and key chains bearing the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint ($4.50 a dozen for the small, $5.50 for the large). Almost always, the items sell for $1 apiece.
Most of the deaf peddlers who crowd the displays at L.A. Top Distributor, a favorite Los Angeles Street store, take their trinkets by the dozens. The salesmen there remember the Paoletti family as the deaf people who stopped shopping there several years ago, only to start calling again last year from New York with huge orders for spinning-globe key chains.
The family's most recent invoice, on Feb. 28, was for 24,000 such key chains at 11.25 cents each. At $1 each, the sales would have made the Paolettis $21,300 -- before shipping charges, subway tokens and the modest sums they apparently spent to lodge and pay their peddlers. (The police believe the shipment would have lasted less than a week.)
Sales territories also vary. Some bosses prefer airports, for the waiting travelers with disposable cash. Peddling rings have been known to fight occasionally over shopping malls they have staked out as turf. At the Los Angeles International Airport, the sales choreography can be baroque.
Maria Correa, 33, a deaf native of Mexico City who now lives in Whittier, Calif., operates independently but sometimes works with friends. She arrived at Terminal One at noon on Friday. By 3:30, she had worked her way through half of the departure lounges and was preparing to leave. There was more money to be made, she was sure, but there were also more deaf peddlers lined up behind her.
"I can't sell all day," she said. "I know there are other deaf people here trying to sell. I want to show them respect."
Ms. Correa said she knew of about 30 small rings of deaf immigrant peddlers in the Los Angeles area. Typically, she said, the bosses put up the money for the trinkets and receive about half of the take. For most of the bosses, that kind of profit margin is apparently enough; bosses as abusive as the Paolettis are relatively rare, she said.
But social service workers, researchers and some former peddlers suggested that at least some level of coercion often seemed a basic part of the arrangements.
Sally Campbell, who trains many deaf immigrants as the coordinator of Special Services at the Abram Friedman Occupational Center in Los Angeles, said some of her students had been forced by bosses to drop out of classes in English and American Sign Language when the schooling was apparently seen to have got in the way of their work.
A deaf immigrant from Mexico, Margarito Flores, 39, of Anaheim, Calif., said it was easier for other deaf immigrants to understand the hardships that went with the job.
"This is helping me and my family," Mr. Flores said through a translator. "I don't want to have to borrow money. I want to earn money. I look at this as a living."

Mr. Flores said deaf immigrants understood the hardships that went with the job. (Liliana Nietro Del Rio)(pg. 26)

HEADLINE: INVESTING IT;
How to Save on Taxes When Taking Those Stock-Market Gains

BYLINE: By JAN M. ROSEN 

 BODY:
WITH the long-booming Dow Jones industrial average now well past 8,000, many investors are sitting on gains they are reluctant to take because of the taxes they would owe. Wouldn't a money-making investment that reduced taxes, instead of adding to them, be welcome?
"Dream on," you say? Although not well-known, there is such an investment -- low-income housing. 
 When Congressional tax writers wiped out tax shelters in 1986, they created a new tax-favored investment for what is known as "affordable housing." In an effort to replace public housing projects with private sector initiatives, Congress offered tax credits -- not tax deductions -- to people who invest in housing developments that qualify.
"Affordable housing today is privately owned and managed with a profit potential," said Richard J. DeAgazio, executive vice president of Boston Capital, which offers these investments.
Through this program, Congress has authorized tax credits of $3.3 billion a year, enough to build or rehabilitate roughly 100,000 units annually. Corporations and individuals have purchased all the $33 billion in credits available since the program started, or almost one million units of low-income housing.
Corporations have received most of these credits, from firms like Arkand & Company in Seattle and the Related Companies in New York. But some syndicators offer private placements to individual investors, and one company, Boston Capital, is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission to sell the investment to individuals publicly.
Boston Capital specializes in small garden apartment complexes in rural and suburban settings. The apartments are rented to the elderly, the disabled and people whose incomes are less than 60 percent of the average in the area. In its recently opened Tax Credit Fund IV -- Series 30, for example, the company will invest in a portfolio of 24 properties in 11 states from Maine to Oklahoma. This is a $25 million offering with an expected 12-year life span, and is being made from the firm directly (800 866-2282) and through 350 stock brokers and financial planners nationwide.
For such investments, the law sets the maximum stake for a taxpayer in the 15 percent bracket at $31,000. That sum would provide an annual tax credit of $3,750. In the top bracket of 39.6 percent, the maximum investment is $82,000, yielding an annual credit of $9,900.
Credits are more valuable than deductions because they reduce taxes dollar-for-dollar, whereas deductions reduce taxes only by the amount of the deduction times a taxpayer's marginal tax rate. For example, a $5,000 credit would be worth $5,000 to any taxpayer; a $5,000 deduction reduces taxes by $750 for taxpayers in the 15 percent bracket; $1,400 in the 28 percent bracket and $1,980 in the 39.6 percent bracket.
The low-income housing credits reduce regular income taxes, regardless of the source of income. And while they do not apply to the alternative minimum tax, people who pay this tax can carry the credits back 3 years or forward 15 years. Moreover, each year Congress has pre-funded the tax credits for 10 years, so even if Congress were to change the law, a person who has already invested would not lose the credits.
Mr. DeAgazio said his company's typical investors are in their 50's, have annual incomes of $75,000 to $200,000 and have paid off the big expenses -- mortgages and their children's education. The average holding of its 65,000 individual investors is $22,000. The minimum investment is $5,000.
But is such an investment worth it, especially since the principal will usually be invested for 12 years or so? One answer comes from Mr. DeAgazio, who calculates, based on Boston Capital offerings that have only a year or two remaining, that investors will have the equivalent of a 12 percent annual return, assuming that the housing units are sold for their original cost when the credits end, which he thinks is likely.
That is about twice the return they would receive on municipal bonds and, just as for muni bond investors, there would no tax liability. But there are no guarantees beyond the tax credits. The theoretical worst case for investors is that once the credits end, there will be no market for the properties themselves, so no capital will be returned. The best case is that the properties will all appreciate and be sold at a profit, providing investors with the credit, a return of capital and a taxable capital gain at the end.
True, because the credits are pre-funded, the investment is a predictable one. It is also counter-cyclical; if the economy were to tank, the demand for low-income housing would climb. Still, independent investment advisers express caution.
S. Timothy Kochis, partner in Kochis Fitz Tracy & Gorman, a fee-only financial consulting and investment management firm in San Francisco, said, "It is completely legitimate, completely kosher, and very low risk, but a so-so investment." The return on some placements has been equivalent to an after-tax gain of only 6 to 7 percent, he said.
Joel S. Isaacson, president of his own accounting and fee-only financial planning firm in New York, said: "We try to get clients to focus on the economics of investing, not be so tax-driven. Sometimes you're better off investing your money for return and paying the taxes." Stocks or other real estate investments, like a real estate investment trust, offer more upside potential and are more liquid, he said.
Because low-income housing is a long-term, relatively illiquid investment, investors typically put only 7 to 8 percent of their portfolios in it. Even so, in an emergency there is a secondary market for the holdings through the Chicago Partnership Board or American Partnership Services.
Mr. Kochis said one appeal, besides the tax break, is altruism. "The ethical consequences of investing are very important to some people," he said, "and this is a way to improve housing stock."

CORRECTION-DATE: September 21, 1997, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article on July 27 about tax credits for investments in low-income housing misstated the name and location of a company that sells such credits to corporate markets. It is the Arcand Company of Portland, Ore., not Arkand & Company of Seattle. The Portland company telephoned on Sept. 10 about the errors.

HEADLINE: FROM THE DESK OF;
A Senior Discount? I Don't Deserve It

BYLINE: By TED M. LEVINE; Ted M. Levine, age 60-plus, is the founder and chairman of Development Counsellors International in Manhattan. The firm helps cities, states and countries attract business and tourism.

 BODY:
A FEW years ago I began getting expensive gifts from people I didn't know.
A generous benefactor paid half the price of my movie theater tickets; I received discounts at hotels and motels around the country, and prestigious universities offered to teach me fascinating courses for free, or almost so. Earlier this year I purchased a round-trip ticket to Charleston, S.C., from New York City at a price 50 percent lower than the going rate. 
 In recent years, the trickle of gifts has grown to a flood of largess that I figure may be worth tens of thousands of dollars to me.
What did I do to deserve all this? Basically, I didn't die.
To be more precise, I lived long enough to qualify for a cornucopia of senior subsidies. Actually, I only had to make it to age 50. So baby boomers, now that you're starting to reach that milestone, take note: There is a 294-page directory especially for you and me titled "Unbelievably Good Deals and Great Adventures That You Absolutely Can't Get Unless You're Over 50" (Contemporary Books). The book details senior discounts offered by hotels, motels, airlines and even universities. You'll also find resorts where you can ski for half price.
"Deals" also explains why I am entitled to these things: "You deserve them, having successfully negotiated your way through life's white waters."
Well, call me a grizzled grinch but I don't buy it. I have to say that the trend toward giving goodies to golden-agers is insulting, and terrible public policy.
Some decades ago, it was different. The over-60 crowd was among America's poorest citizens. But now Social Security, pensions, financial planning and parsimony are changing that. Consider these statistics:
* In 1970, almost one-fourth of all Americans aged 65 and over were living below the poverty line, the Census showed. By 1995, that figure had plunged to 10.5 percent.
* The net worth of older Americans is pulling farther ahead of the net worth of younger people in some of their prime years of earning power. The latest figures from a survey issued every three years by the Federal Reserve showed that in 1995, the average net worth of Americans aged 65 to 74 was $331,600, compared with $308,300 in 1992. The net worth of those aged 35 to 44, meanwhile, remained virtually unchanged, at just over $144,000.
No, seniors don't need cheap movie seats or even free vacations. But I'd go a step further: Many of us don't even want them.
We not only know we own more, spend more, travel more and vote more than any other age group, but we're also proud of it. And being crudely seduced into the market with half-price off-peak train tickets or nominally discounted rental cars tends to stick in some of our collective craws.
Having grown up reading "Self-Reliance," by Ralph Waldo Emerson, I wonder what we have done to deserve all this commercial generosity. Somehow, not dying doesn't seem a sufficient justification.
Ah, but I hear a voice explaining that while carloads of senior loot may not be good public policy, it is good commercial policy. Companies are, it is argued, making billions of extra dollars by luring the over-the-hill gang to buy, buy, buy what they might not without the discount incentive.
That argument may have been true at one time, but it isn't now and it certainly won't be in the future.
The 65-plus contingent is the fastest-growing age category. Lester Thurow, the economist, has called this group the "revolutionary class" and has cited numbers to show its increasing weight: The group represented only 4 percent of the American population in 1900. Today, it's 13 percent, and by 2025, it is expected to be a stunning 20 percent. In that year, there will be an estimated 75 million people aged 65 and over. And we can expect that, having been a group of relatively high-income earners, they will remain among the richest in retirement.
IT is brainless to offer so many discounts to so many relatively wealthy people. Like other subsidies, these gifts will turn around and bite the first commercial subsidizers. Subsidies may be O.K. when offered to a few people, but anyone who starts subsidizing a large group will ultimately have to charge everyone else more. In the end, the under-65 consumer -- that is, a lot of you -- will be penalized.
Now let's get back to me. Don't I enjoy a little thrill in paying half the price of the folks on line at my local movie theater?
The answer is yes. But I'd get an even bigger thrill from letting everyone know I was paying my own way.

HEADLINE: For Sony's Studios, A New Mood;
More Hits and Less Worry on Interference

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 27

 BODY:
James Marshall is, to put it mildly, a remarkable man. Using martial arts, stealth and sheer grit, he battles a planeload of terrorists, but not without a twinge of conscience. He fights for the lives of dozens of other Americans on board, including his wife and their courageous daughter. In the process, he tries to establish the United States as a bulwark of principle in a world of self-interest.
And by the way, he's the President of the United States, a man more concerned with morals than with votes. 
 Hollywood has only rarely put a positive spin on American Presidents of late, as in "Independence Day" and "The American President." But in "Air Force One," Harrison Ford portrays the President as such an earnest and unblemished paragon of virtue that the movie plays as Rambo on wings, a paean to patriotism. The United States is presented as the best hope in a dark world. Should audiences miss the point, there is even a tense moment in the movie (which brought in an estimated $37.1 million in its first weekend), when the President must guess which wires to connect in a control panel and remarks that the red, white and blue ones must never be crossed.
Historically, Hollywood has not been shy about wrapping itself in the flag when that suited its purposes, but what's noteworthy here is that the studio is Columbia Pictures, owned by Sony, the giant Japanese company.
In 1989, when the Sony Corporation acquired Columbia for $3.5 billion, followed by Matsushita's acquisition of MCA and Universal Pictures for $6.1 billion a few months later, it caused a wave of fear. Some Americans warned that the Japanese companies, battering their American competitors in the trade wars, would now subvert the content of movies. It seemed that an economic battle had turned into a battle for America's cultural soul. A cover article in Newsweek proclaimed, "Japan Invades Hollywood."
There was even concern that the vast movie library owned by the studio would be misused in Japanese hands. "Who protects the interests of the people of the United States when it comes to these motion pictures?" George Stevens Jr., the head of the American Film Institute, asked in Congressional testimony at that time. "How will future generations judge us if we allow these expressions of the American spirit to be lost to us?"
That seems a long time ago. The Japanese economy is struggling today with a recession that began in 1990, while the American economy is soaring. Numerous Japanese companies have lost billions of dollars on ill-considered purchases of American real estate and American companies, including Sony, which has only recently began to recover from its own losses. The cultural heart of the United States appears to be beating strongly.
If anything, the fears today in Hollywood concern China, which owns no studios but has objected strongly to the content of two coming films on Tibet, a country forcibly annexed by Beijing. There are "Seven Years in Tibet," produced by Sony's Tri-Star studio, and Disney's "Kundun." The worry is that studios may be pressured into censoring films that are perceived as critical of China to insure future access to the Chinese market.
"We have always feared foreign influence in ways that were mostly overstated," said Jeffrey Garten, the dean of the Yale School of Management and a former senior Commerce Department official involved in trade issues with Japan. "In the 1970's we thought Arab money would take over the U.S. And then it was Japan. Now we're worried about Chinese influence."
He added: "The real irony is that it's American culture dominating everyone else. We've been looking through the wrong end of the telescope."
"Air Force One" is just a thriller (directed, as it happens, by Wolfgang Petersen, a German), but it reinforces the view that what Sony wants more than anything, after suffering billions of dollars in losses on its movie studio acquisition, is a profit, not control over the content of movies. Mr. Stevens now says in addition that Sony has probably done a better job preserving its American film classics than American-owned studios.
"Obviously, our strategic and financial interests are mutual, but all creative decisions are exclusively local," insisted John Calley, the president of Sony Pictures Entertainment, the studio unit that oversees Columbia and Tri-Star. "We're accountable for all decisions about movie selection and production, as we should be." Yuki Nozoe, an executive vice president at Sony Pictures Entertainment and the sole Japanese executive on the studio lot, added, "We usually talk only about how we can do business from their creative ideas, consumer tie-ins and marketing."
Nobuyuki Idei, the tough-minded, hands-on president of the Sony Corporation, was in town two weeks ago for a series of meetings and viewed for the first time Columbia's current hit movie, "Men in Black." Several people recalled that afterward he quickly asked one thing, "Will it make money?"
That concern is understandable, considering that Sony's flier in the entertainment business cost it perhaps $8 billion and no small amount of embarrassment. After acquiring Columbia and Tri-Star, Sony went on to spend more than $700 million to bring in Jon Peters and Peter Guber to run the studios. The two producers, who had made films like "Batman" for Warner Brothers, already had a reputation in Hollywood for spending freely. The studio unit's revenues declined steadily through the fiscal year ending March 31, 1996, and Sony took a $3.2 billion loss in 1994.
 
Rebounding To a Record Year
Making things worse, the new management team , Alan J. Levine and Mark Canton, was also regarded as ineffectual. They, too, were forced out late last year, to be replaced by Mr. Calley; Lucy Fisher, the vice chairwoman of Columbia Tri-Star Motion Pictures, and Gareth Wigan, co-vice chairman.
But the studios began to rebound strongly last year, and in 1997 they are experiencing a record year. "Jerry Maguire," "Men in Black," "My Best Friend's Wedding" and now "Air Force One" are doing exceptionally well at the box office. These films were all developed by Mr. Levine and Mr. Canton, the discredited management team. And Sony is now seen not as a company bent on controlling its studios' output, but as a struggling Hollywood newcomer eager for little more than stability and a profit.
"I never took all that talk about the Japanese seriously," said Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of the News Corporation, the Australian company that owns the 20th Century Fox studio. "I always thought that if they had been so foolish as to try and control the movies, the public would have destroyed them."
He added: "If anything, the subversive films, the films questioning American values, American traditions, have all come from Americans. This is all really a non-issue."
Tom Pollock, who had been head of Universal Studios when Matsushita bought MCA, said: "Let's be honest, most of those fears at that time, they were more about racism than anything else. What we learned is that the same people are making movies that made them before. Hollywood is a culture that deals with itself. Japanese ownership didn't change that."
In fact, there have been changes in ownership. After suffering through poor returns and conflict with the American management of MCA, Matsushita sold 80 percent of its shareholding to Seagram two years ago. Sony has held talks on several occasions in an effort to sell all or part of its studios. Sony insists that the studios are not on the block now, and they are enjoying their most profitable year ever.
Mr. Pollock and executives at Sony's studios said that their Japanese owners had never vetted scripts or insisted on reviewing the contents of movies. Nevertheless, there have been several instances when there were fears about interference from Tokyo. Universal Pictures made a 1991 film, "Mr. Baseball," about an American baseball player who collides with Japanese culture when he goes to play in Japan. Two jokes that referred to World War II were eliminated, and the script became less irreverent about Japanese culture. But Mr. Pollock said the changes were simply an effort to make a lackluster film better.
 
War Remains A Sensitive Subject
In another example, "Hell Camp," a Columbia Pictures comedy about an American sumo wrestler in Japan, was killed at the last minute. At the time, executives said the problem was with the Sumo Association in Japan, which refused to cooperate with the project. Mike Medavoy, who was then the head of the studio, said that Sony had tried to help gain clearance but failed, and he said there was no censorship at all.
A particularly sensitive subject is still World War II, which some thought might be a test of the Japanese studio owners. Mr. Medavoy said he is currently producing "The Thin Red Line," the second film to be made from the James Jones novel about the American defeat of Japan at Guadalcanal. The executive producer, interestingly, is George Stevens. Mr. Medavoy said he had taken the project to Sony, which passed, and he had then taken it to Fox, which agreed to do the movie.
Asked if Japanese sensitivities were involved, he said: "Not at all. This was purely commercial. I know that if they thought it would have made money, they would have done it. I was more enthusiastic about it than they were, and that's what this business is all about."

Chart/Graph: "SONY"
1989 -- Sony Corporation paid $3.5 billion for Columbia Pictures and Tri-Star Pictures, and set up Sony Pictures Entertainment to oversee the studios. Chart shows estimated box office revenues to date for the movie division's big hits of 1997: "Jerry Maguire," "My Best Friend's Wedding," "Men in Black" and, very likely, "Air Force One."
 
AT THE START
After buying Columbia and Tri-Star, Sony went on to spend $700 million to bring in two producers to run the studios. Peter Guber became chairman and chief executive officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 1989 and left in September 1994. Jon Peters, co-chairman, left in May 1991.
 
LATER ON
Alan J. Levine replaced Mr. Guber, becoming president and chief operating officer of the movie division, and left two years later. Mark Canton, who was hired as president of Columbia Pictures in October 1991, was promoted to chairman of Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Companies in January 1994. He left in September 1996. The current array of hits was all developed on their watch.
 
IN COMMAND
John Calley became president and chief operating officer of Sony Pictures Entertainment in November 1996, with Lucy Fisher as vice chairwoman of Columbia Tri-Star Motion Picture Companies and Gareth Wigan as co-vice chairman.

HEADLINE: Compaq Retains Lead as PC Sales Soar

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif., July 27

 BODY:
The personal computer market continued to grow robustly in the second quarter, with double-digit increases in sales domestically and worldwide, according to two research groups.
The groups reporting, Dataquest Inc. and the International Data Corporation, said today that the Compaq Computer Corporation had strengthened its position as the No. 1 supplier worldwide, while Hewlett-Packard, at No. 3, and Dell Computer, which was No. 4, had particularly strong gains in sales. 
 International Data reported that worldwide PC shipments totaled 18.2 million in the April-through-June period, up 15 percent from the corresponding period last year. Shipments in the United States totaled 7.2 million, up 19 percent.
Dataquest said that second-quarter global shipments reached 18.9 million, up 17 percent from a year earlier, and that shipments in the United States came to 7 million, an increase of 21.9 percent.
Both reports said that Compaq's worldwide shipments jumped 42 percent in the April-June quarter, giving it a market share of nearly 12 percent. I.B.M. retained its No. 2 worldwide ranking, seeing shipments rise 20 percent, the reports said.
International Data reported that Hewlett-Packard's shipments vaulted by 48 percent; Dataquest reported a 58.4 percent increase worldwide. Dell, the largest direct seller of computers in the United States, saw its global shipments rise by 61.4 percent, according to Dataquest, and 52 percent, according to International Data.
"They're going like a freight train out of control these days, which is good," John Brown, an International Data analyst in Mountain View, Calif., said of Dell. "They're giving notice to the guys above."
But the "guys above," challenged by Dell's lower prices, are responding with their own price cuts. While that is good news for consumers and businesses, it could lead to severe pressure on smaller companies, said Scott Miller, a Dataquest analyst.
Such companies may be forced to insure sales by cutting prices and sacrificing profit. If they do not or cannot do that, they will probably see their share of the market erode, Mr. Miller said.
Completing the top five in terms of worldwide shipments was Packard Bell-NEC, which Dataquest said had 1.7 percent fewer shipments in the second quarter than a year earlier. International Data said Packard Bell-NEC's shipments rose 5 percent. While No. 5 on the global list, Packard Bell-NEC is No. 2 behind Compaq in the United States. Dell, International Business Machines and Hewlett-Packard follow in domestic ranking.
Neither Dataquest nor International Data rank personal computer makers beyond the top five. Apple Computer, which is struggling to recover from financial losses and declining market share, slipped from the top five earlier this year.
Mr. Brown said that while Apple's shipments rose 16 percent from the first quarter, they fell 21 percent from the second quarter of last year. The company's market share was 3.8 percent in the latest period.

HEADLINE: Asians Are Cool to Albright on Cambodians and Burmese

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, July 27

 BODY:
Japan today rebuffed American requests to use aid to put pressure on Cambodia to hold free and fair elections, while the leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations listened noncommitally as Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright urged them to work for democratic change in Myanmar.
Ms. Albright came face to face today with the polite indirection of Asia and of the nine-member Asean, which values collegiality and consensus above all virtues. Asean officials almost never "tell it like it is," which Ms. Albright has promised will be her trademark. 
 Ms. Albright's admonitions to Asean about its responsibilities in Myanmar, Cambodia and North Korea, where the United States wants the organization to contribute $10 million a year to promote nuclear nonproliferation, were predictable, an Asean diplomat said today. "We expected something of a lecture, and that's what we heard," he said.
But Ms. Albright has also heard some lecturing in return, in particular from the Malaysian Prime Minister, Mahathir Mohamad, who is known for his resentment of what he considers Western arrogance.
In a meeting with Asean and its partners, Ms. Albright objected to the picture of affairs in Myanmar, formerly Burma, painted by its Foreign Minister, U Ohn Gyaw. She described the Burmese military as drug traffickers and thugs.
Now that Asean has welcomed Myanmar to its fold over American objections, Ms. Albright said, the organization has a greater responsibility to promote democratic change there. "We must insist that we work together to promote conditions that will lead toward true democracy," she said of Myanmar.
She urged the nations of Asean to meet with the leader of the Burmese democracy movement, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Her National League for Democracy won 1990 elections before the military seized power and put her under house arrest.
Asked for Asean's reaction, Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi of the host country, Malaysia, said mildly, "It is for Asean to decide later what we will do, and we will bear in mind the views of Ms. Albright and others."
Rather than isolating Myanmar, Asean would continue its policy of "constructive engagement" with the military there, he said. He smiled and added, "But it is factually correct that the Burmese are not taking big steps forward."
Asean comprises Brunei, Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Laos.
On Cambodia, neither Asean nor Japan was willing to hold back the bulk of their aid to press Hun Sen, the former co-Prime Minister who took power this month by defeating the forces of his rival, to keep his promises for free and fair elections, as the United States, the European Union and Australia are willing to do.
"We believe it useful to coalesce around the question of aid to influence Cambodia, but Japan and Asean have a different view," the State Department spokesman, Nicholas Burns, said after Ms. Albright's meeting with the Japanese Foreign Minister, Yukihiko Ikeda.
Half of Cambodia's budget is foreign aid, and Japan's $153 million a year represents half of that. Japan says it has four conditions for continuing aid: respect for human rights, maintenance of constitutional government, respect for the 1991 Paris accords that led to the 1993 elections, and free and fair elections in May for a new government.
While those conditions are not now being met, Mr. Hun Sen has promised to meet them, and that is sufficient, said Mr. Ikeda's spokesman, Nobuaki Tanaka. "There is a commitment -- that we respect."
Mr. Mahathir, the Malaysian Prime Minister, while polite to Ms. Albright in person, has been making some of the choice anti-American statements that keep him so popular in the developing world.
In a speech to Asean, Mr. Mahathir, whose country was once a British colony, spoke of the need for unity and said: "We suffered in a bipolar world. We know now that a unipolar world is no better."
He criticized what he sees as an American assumption that Asia needs its protection, first during the Vietnam War, and today from other Eastern countries like China.
He has also found a scapegoat in America for Southeast Asia's recent economic crisis, which has driven down the value of regional currencies. He contended that the crisis was a result of "a well-planned effort to undermine the economies of all the Asean countries by destabilizing their currencies."
The evil genius behind the plan, he has said repeatedly, is George Soros, the American financier and philanthropist who promotes human rights and democratization all over the world, including in Myanmar. Mr. Soros, Mr. Mahathir charges, has attacked Asean currencies "to block Myanmar's admission into Asean." The result, Mr. Mahathir says, is further suffering of the region's poor.
Mr. Soros and the manager of his currency funds have denied any effort to destabilize Asean or to punish it for admitting Myanmar.
"George Soros is an honorable person and has done a lot of good in the world," Mr. Burns told Malaysian Television. "Currency crises are common, and all is fair in international finance."

HEADLINE: White House Says Iran Pipeline Won't Violate Sanctions Act

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
Despite a new law meant to discourage foreign investment in Iran's oil and gas industry, the Clinton Administration has decided not to object to a $1.6 billion project to build a natural gas pipeline through Iran, Administration officials said today.
The officials insisted, however, that the Administration's tacit approval of the project did not reflect any easing of its longstanding efforts to isolate Iran economically and diplomatically. 
 Instead, they said, the Administration has signaled that it would not oppose the project since the pipeline's primary beneficiaries would be the two countries on either end of it -- Turkmenistan and Turkey -- and not Iran.
The pipeline, stretching some 2,000 miles from Turkmenistan, through Iran and into Turkey and perhaps beyond to Europe, would cost $1.6 billion and could eventually carry 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas to energy-short Turkey.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the project, as now structured, would not violate the Iran-Libya Sanctions Act of 1996. That law, sponsored by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, gives the President the power to impose sanctions on foreign companies that invest $40 million or more a year in the oil or gas industries in Iran or Libya.
Even though the pipeline would pass through Iran and the Islamic Government in Teheran would stand to profit by charging transit fees, the Administration has concluded that the project would not constitute an investment in Iran's industry and that therefore it would not provoke sanctions under the act.
The Administration's decision, which was first reported today in The Washington Post, raised immediate concerns in Congress that the project would allow Iran to profit on an international energy deal in spite of the spirit, if not the letter, of the new law.
"I have some very real reservations," Senator D'Amato said today in a statement released by his office in New York City. "It will enable a Government which is still exporting terrorism to have the resources with which they can continue that practice."
The White House, anticipating intense questions surrounding the project, reiterated the United States' firm opposition to Iran. "There's been no change in policy or any signal regarding that policy," a White House spokeswoman, Anne R. Luzzatto, said today. "It is U.S. law and U.S. policy to seek to deny Iran the resources it needs to pursue terrorism and weapons of mass destruction."
Also, the officials who spoke on condition of anonymity emphasized that they still hoped to persuade Turkey and Turkmenistan to find an alternate route that would bypass Iran, perhaps even under the Caspian Sea.
One Administration official noted that from the perspective of the United States, this project was preferable to the one announced last year by Necmettin Erbakan, who was then Prime Minister of Turkey and the country's first ruler from a pro-Islamic party. Under that deal, now apparently moot, Turkey had agreed to purchase $23 billion of Iran's natural gas.
That project would have directly benefited Iran and could have triggered sanctions against Turkey, a close American ally and a member of NATO.
In the months after Mr. Erbakan signed that deal, the United States repeatedly raised its objections in talks with the Turks, explaining that Turkey would face sanctions if it went ahead. "We did not want to see an ally sanctioned," a senior Administration official said.
In May, Turkey signed an agreement to buy Turkmenistan's natural gas instead. The new project reflected a "significant evolution" from the original deal, the official said, allowing Turkey to buy gas while largely shutting out Iran.
One official said Iran stood to lose the most under the new arrangement since it would not be able to sell its gas to Turkey as originally proposed. "We see this as a powerful reaffirmation of our relationship with Turkey and not as a signal to the Iranians," the official said. "If this benefits anyone, it's the Turks."
The project could also help advance other American interests in the region.
Turkmenistan has the world's third-largest reserves of natural gas. Its market has long been in Russia to the north, but the United States hopes to help develop other outlets for the oil and gas reserves in Turkmenistan and the other Central Asian republics. Iran's strategic location between the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea has created an obstacle to that policy.
Although planning for the project remains in the earliest stages, it would conceivably involve a consortium of international energy concerns, led by Turkey's state-owned oil and gas pipeline company, Botas.
One official said the project could still violate the new law, if, for example, an international company contracted to build a significant part of the 788 miles of pipeline through Iran.
Ms. Luzzatto, the White House spokeswoman, said the Administration would continue to enforce the new law, monitoring "this and other deals" that could benefit Iran.

G.O.P.-M.I.A.

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Watching Jesse Helms, the Republican boss of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, tear apart the nomination as ambassador to Mexico of William Weld, the Republican Governor of Massachusetts, it occurred to me: What ever happened to Republican foreign policy?
Do those three words -- "Republican foreign policy" -- have any meaning anymore? Talking to Republicans, the answer is increasingly "No." There is no reasonably unified Republican view on any major foreign issue, be it trade, NATO or China. "We simply have not come up with a coherent foreign policy of our own," says Senator John McCain, one of the few serious defense thinkers left in his party's leadership. 
 Who killed Republican foreign policy? In part it was the collapse of the Soviet threat, which had been the keystone of Republican national security thinking. But President Clinton has also done to Republicans on foreign policy what he did to them on domestic policy: He occupied all the middle ground -- on trade, on NATO, on China and on intervention generally -- so that, as one Administration official put it, "Republicans either have to become Clintonites on foreign policy or become crazies. It's totally disoriented them."
Indeed, Pat Buchanan, with his far-out isolationist protectionism is the only Republican leader with his own vision. As a result, some young conservative thinkers are trying to fill the void. One school is neo-Reaganism, represented by Bill Kristol and Bob Kagan of the conservative Weekly Standard. K. & K. advocate an expansive, large notion of U.S. leadership, which Mr. Kristol unabashedly describes as "enlightened imperialism without the empire." Their view is that America is the only superpower and it should act like it -- not just defending its own vital interest, not just reacting to others, but using its influence and military weight to vigorously and, when necessary, unilaterally promote human rights and American values from Bosnia to Beijing. They advocate a particularly tough line on China, arguing that it is the biggest moral and strategic threat to the U.S. "We are assertive Reaganites," says Mr. Kristol (but without a Reagan or a Teddy Roosevelt to carry their banner).
Countering this approach is a thoughtful new book by former Bush adviser Richard Haass, entitled "The Reluctant Sheriff," which embodies "neo-Bushism." Mr. Haass is also for engagement, but believes the U.S. doesn't have the resources or public support for the unilateral, size-large leadership of the Kagan-Kristol view. He argues that the U.S. must lead by building coalitions of countries or institutions that would concentrate on doing two big jobs -- preventing aggression between nations and promoting free trade among nations. "If we can just get those two things right, we will have a solid foundation for peace and prosperity," said Mr. Haass.
"Kagan and Kristol argue that the purpose of U.S. foreign policy should be to maintain U.S. hegemony," said Mr. Haass. "They want to prevent the rise of competitors. That is both impossible and unwise. We should be aiming to co-opt competitors and, where possible, transform them. Our goal should be to build a world to our liking that we can sustain at a reduced cost." Mr. Haass insists economic engagement is the best way to change China and that the neocons are "wrong and shortsighted" by trying to isolate Beijing, which will neither produce human rights there nor protect U.S. strategic interests.
So Republicans have two foreign policy visions and no leader and the Democrats have a leader but no particular vision. With the world so peaceful, does it matter that the Republicans can't mount a unified, coherent critique? I think so. There are some huge issues to be decided this year -- Bosnia, NATO, China -- and the Clinton team's sloppiness in dealing with these issues up to now is due partly to the fact that all the Republicans have mustered is drive-by foreign policy: drive by the White House, shout something, then drive off.
"There has to be a vigorous debate and illumination of issues," argued Senator McCain. "Because without that the American people are uninformed and uninterested. Look what's happened in Haiti. It's terrible. We had 20,000 troops there for two years and spent $2 billion. And it's all coming apart now. But nobody gives a darn, and how do you keep the Administration honest if nobody cares?"

HEADLINE: As Cathedral Opens, Preacher-Politician Looks Ahead

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
A few hours after attending services early yesterday morning, Charlene Simpson was so overwhelmed by the opening of New York City's newest cathedral that she returned to worship at the day's third and final service. For Mrs. Simpson, the new $23 million Cathedral of the Allen African Methodist Episcopal Church in Jamaica, Queens, was the crowning achievement in the church's efforts to rebuild what is still one of the borough's poorest corners.
And, Mrs. Simpson said, without its pastor, the Rev. Floyd H. Flake, who has been the area's United States Representative since 1986, the neighborhood would have been "a disaster." 
 "It would have been like the Wild West," said Mrs. Simpson, 50, a bank manager who has lived in nearby St. Albans for 31 years. "We wouldn't have had a leader."
The talk of Jamaica yesterday centered around the long-anticipated opening of the cathedral, a soaring modern structure on Merrick Boulevard and 110th Avenue, by the most powerful church in the predominantly black section of southeast Queens. But given Mr. Flake's dual role as preacher and politician, some parishioners predictably wondered whether the opening would lead to another change.
After months of rumors that he might not seek a seventh term in Congress, Mr. Flake, 52, said last week that he might retire from politics to focus on the growing Allen A.M.E. Church, where he has been pastor for 21 years. Yesterday, Mr. Flake said that he had not made up his mind but would announce his decision to his congregants next Sunday.
"They will be the first to know what my plans are," he said after the end of the third service yesterday.
Several members said they were torn by their desire to have Mr. Flake exercise more direct authority over their church in Queens, and the knowledge that the area had greatly benefited from the Congressman's success in channeling dollars from Washington.
Selena Turner, 33, an account executive at an insurance company, said she had noticed many improvements to the district since she had moved to the area six years ago. They included dozens of two-family homes that the church's real estate arm helped build a few years ago with city and state housing dollars near Linden and Guy R. Brewer Boulevards.
"I remember it was just dirt there, and now there are homes," said Ms. Turner, who was standing in line for the beginning of the morning's third service with her twin 5-year-old nephew and niece, Jarese and Jonice Johnson. "It's the same with this new church."
"I feel he should do what God leads him to do," Ms. Turner said about Mr. Flake's coming announcement.
Although some of Mr. Flake's critics have said that he has not secured the same level of public and private investment for his entire district, the development around the Congressman's neighborhood, near the intersection of Merrick and Linden, is hard to miss: a 300-unit apartment complex for the elderly built with Federal housing loans, the Allen Christian School, hundreds of houses built with the help of Fannie Mae loans.
Mr. Flake, who used his friendships with powerful Republicans to gain economic clout for his district, pointed out yesterday that the Federal Drug Administration and Federal Aviation Administration were building offices in his district.
"This is the only Congressional district in the city where you have any Federal building being built," he said. "At the same time, I've been able to get this church built."
Mr. Flake said the 93,000-square-foot complex, with an 84-foot-high stone steeple, will be paid for with money raised by the 8,600-member congregation. "This is going to have to be the wave of the future if we're actually going to turn these urban communities around," he said. "People who live in them will have to understand that you have to invest in them."
The new Allen Cathedral, with 2,500 seats the largest church structure to be built in New York City since 1954, is now the second largest black church in New York, after the Concord Baptist Church in Brooklyn, which seats 2,800. Finishing touches are still being made to the cathedral's offices, and the windows are yet to be installed.
Against the backdrop of a 100-member choir, Mr. Flake told his congregants that they had more work ahead, including obtaining and renovating a boarded-up, two-story commercial strip across the street from the new church. But yesterday, the pastor turned most of his attention to the cathedral and at least some attention to the issue of paying off $23 million in construction costs.
Mr. Flake reminded churchgoers that they had worshiped for 14 years in the Allen School's auditorium, sitting on uncomfortable blue chairs.
"You asked me, 'When are we going to fix them?' " he said. "Why would we fix something we were not going to be using permanently. And we didn't want you to be too comfortable. You'd still want to be sitting over there.
"But this morning, we're here. And we're sitting on cushioned pews. Cushioned pews. We're walking on nice carpet, plush. Everything's beautiful. Look at the woodwork. And look at the redwood ceiling all the way from Canada. Amen. We're ready for the future."
"I ask you," Mr. Flake added, "touch that pew again. It's an unpaid-for pew." It was a masterly segue that drew both laughs and dollar bills.

HEADLINE: After Quiet Success, Columbia's President Faces Din of Protest;
Conflict Over a Dean's Dismissal Puts George Rupp In the Spotlight

BYLINE: By BRUCE WEBER

 BODY:
The conflict of hubris versus humility surfaces in George E. Rupp when he summarizes his professional life.
"I build institutions," he said in a recent interview. Then, as if that sounded brash, he shrugged and undercut himself. "It's what I do for a living, for better or worse." 
 Four years ago this month, Mr. Rupp took over as president of Columbia University. He had spent eight well-regarded years as president of Rice University in Houston, but he arrived here an unknown. And, truth be told, he still is, despite ample successes at Columbia -- a $650 million building program, a two-thirds boost in undergraduate applications and an increase of more than $1 billion in the endowment.
On campus, the prevailing view of Mr. Rupp is that he can do the job, but it is as if he does not believe it himself. He just cannot seem to sell the job he is doing. That may be why his first prominent misstep attracted more attention than all his achievements put together.
On June 30, Mr. Rupp dismissed the popular dean of Columbia College, the university's undergraduate school. The uproar among professors, students and alumni -- who saw the dean, Austin E. Quigley, as their advocate in the Byzantine game of institutional politics -- was immediate. Three days later, Mr. Rupp reinstated him.
"It makes me look like I caved," he said in an interview in his office, though he insisted it was not so. With tie loosened and sleeves rolled, he looked exasperated with the whole thing.
The reversal has left the president appearing at worst spineless, at best mystifying. Many at Columbia are befuddled by his combination of aggressive tactics and unimposing personality. "This is a black mark that's very public for a man who didn't have one," said Donald C. Hood, a professor of psychology. "If you were to ask should George Rupp continue as president, I would say yes. But when I heard about Austin, I thought I'd heard everything. This was a really stupid move."
A Presbyterian minister, slightly built and unprepossessing, Mr. Rupp, 54, comes off more as a God-fearing Little League coach than a chief executive. And though his vision of Columbia as a forward-looking and cogently organized institution is ambitious and, many faculty members say, sound, he is apparently not the kind of leader people like to be pushed by. He does not work a room well. He is energetic but not energizing.
That is true, said Joan W. Konner, the departing dean of the Graduate School of Journalism, but perhaps that is not the central point. "I don't know that there has been much discussion of his values," she said. "He is out to change our style and nature." Columbia, she said, has had factions that contribute to an intramurally competitive and even backbiting atmosphere. She said: "Columbia has an ingrained set of values. 'We're the toughest. We're the smartest.' And it's not such a great set of values. George is more community oriented."
That is why people are often surprised by the list of Mr. Rupp's accomplishments since taking office in 1993, which includes the initiation of ambitious projects like a long-needed renovation of Butler Library, the construction of a $70 million student center, and, more modestly, the improvement of the food in the undergraduate dining hall. He had the dormitories wired for Internet access and streamlined the student billing process; as a result, more people are paying their tuition on time.
"The most striking characteristic of President Rupp's term is the long-overdue overhaul of the nonacademic side of the university," said David J. Helfand, chairman of the astronomy department. "That's not trivial. To try and hire someone from a secretary to a senior researcher, it used to be a nightmare."
In addition to the increase in applications, the rate of admission, 30 percent in 1993, decreased to 17 percent for this fall's entering class. It is more selective than it used to be. Riding the strong economy, Mr. Rupp oversaw an increase in donations from $116 million the year before he arrived to more than $200 million this year, and raised the endowment from $1.8 billion in 1993 to an estimated $3 billion as of June 30.
Even Mr. Rupp's detractors give him credit for his deft handling of an incident last year when 100 students occupied Hamilton Hall, the main college building, demanding the creation of an ethnic studies curriculum, which he brought to an end sternly but with peaceful negotiations.
"I have not seen a president deal with a student disturbance more effectively," said Professor Hood, who has been at Columbia since 1969. "He did not give away any power of the curriculum, he didn't grant any amnesty, but they still worked it out, and we had a peaceful graduation."
When Mr. Rupp arrived from Rice, which has 4,200 students, he stepped in magnitude of responsibility. Columbia, with an annual budget of $1.2 billion, has 15 schools and 70 academic departments and divisions, in which it offers 6,000 courses to 20,000 students. It is the third largest private employer in the city.
Mr. Rupp did not appear to be cowed. He made an immediate impression by cleaning house even before he arrived, replacing three deans, including Jack Greenberg, the former director of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund and dean of Columbia College.
He has replaced much of the university's senior administration. Many people praise his hirings, among them those of David Cohen, formerly the provost of Northwestern University, now the vice president of the Arts and Sciences Division, and Emily S. Lloyd, the former City Sanitation Commissioner who is the chief operating officer. But others lament those who have fallen by the wayside, including Lance Liebman, dean of the School of Law, and John G. Ruggie, dean of the School of International and Public Affairs.
From the outset, Mr. Rupp said he would exploit what he sees as Columbia's chief assets: its New York City location, renowned faculty and international reputation. But most of all, he has focused on reining in an institution that had become so diverse as to be nearly unrecognizable as a whole. He consolidated disparate resources, linking the economics and business faculties, for example.
But nothing has been so central to his vision as the augmentation of Columbia College, the undergraduate school.
Columbia is largely a research institution, but its ratio of undergraduates to graduate students is uncommonly small. That is a problem, not least because Ph.D. students frequently need subsidies, while the tuition-paying undergraduates provide revenue.
Undergraduate alumni tend to be the most generous donors. But Columbia has the smallest undergraduate school in the Ivy League, and ranks near the bottom in percentage of alumni who contribute. Columbia College has enlarged its student body from 2,950 in the mid-80's to 3,600 today. By 2000, the enrollment will top 4,000. But more students mean more services and more teachers.
That is at the heart of the Quigley incident, in which Mr. Rupp seems to have erred, either by reversing himself or by dismissing Mr. Quigley in the first place.
This is how it played out: in the debate over the allotment of resources to Columbia College, Mr. Quigley, an English professor who was promoted from the faculty and was a favorite of students, found himself on the opposite side from Mr. Cohen, the new vice president for arts and sciences to whom he reports. Mr. Rupp eventually sided with Mr. Cohen.
Their disagreements were over the apportioning of teaching responsibilities between undergraduate and graduate schools and how quickly Columbia should expand its recruitment. But the underlying tension was financial.
The Arts and Sciences Division, which encompasses five schools, including Columbia College, has been running at a deficit, but the college itself has not. Mr. Cohen and Mr. Quigley were fighting over resources. Shortly after Mr. Cohen wrote a negative evaluation of Mr. Quigley, Mr. Rupp dismissed him.
"Where are the resources going?" asked Michael Rosenberg, a professor of English. "That's one of the issues Austin was fighting over. My concern is, if you have a larger college and don't make it a better college, what have you got?"
Mr. Rupp acknowledged "there have been tensions." When the tensions turned counterproductive, he said, he dismissed Mr. Quigley.
"George has to back his people," one dean said, speaking on condition of anonymity, "and Cohen is his people. I really think he just didn't know the whole score. The deans are too important, too visible. They usually have a constituency. George just didn't do his homework in taking a very big step."
As the news spread, letters and phone calls of protest poured into the president's office. Mr. Quigley had been dismissed on a Monday; on Wednesday, Mr. Rupp was visited by four influential Columbians, who asked Mr. Rupp to reconsider, including Philip Milstein, a trustee, and Carlos R. Munoz, president of the Columbia College Alumni Association. The same day, 25 members of the alumni association came to his office and, in a meeting that grew heated, made the same request.
What changed Mr. Rupp's mind is unclear. He says it was partly their fervor. Insisting there was no financial pressure brought to bear, he added, "Not one of them said, 'I'll withdraw my gifts.' "
But Mr. Munoz, an executive vice president of Dime Savings Bank of New York, saw it differently.
"There were people who were giving a lot of money who were upset," he said, "and certainly there was an implied threat."
Mr. Rupp recently lamented that the incident became public. He had been negotiating a rapprochement with Mr. Quigley, he said, when news of the dismissal spread.
"I'm an impatient person," he said. "Austin and I have disagreements about the pace of some changes. But we work well together. We have a congruent view of what we're doing. We had a little bit of a tiff and we worked it out."
The Board of Trustees remains supportive of the president, say its two vice chairmen, Lionel I. Pincus and Jerry I. Speyer. But the reversal has left many Columbians wondering who is really in charge. They remain as split on Mr. Rupp's character as he seems to be himself.
Mr. Quigley, perhaps, deserves the last word, and he delivered his judgment, deftly spun. "He's a strong and forceful leader," he said, "who is not afraid to change direction when he feels circumstances warrant."

HEADLINE: New York Should Ban All Crowded Housing

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Alan Wolfe's appeal to reason on the issue of illegal immigration (Op-Ed, July 23) ignores the fact that immigrants are attracted to this country because low-paying jobs are readily available. Their labor thus underwrites the high living standards of the rest of the population. Immigration policy aggressively targets them instead of their employers. This drives their wages down even further. 
 The recent plight of the Mexican deaf-mutes in New York City might not be a parable, as Mr. Wolfe asserts, but it is a clear example of the working conditions and marginalization prompted by immigration policies that fail to address the economic mechanisms behind the phenomenon.

HEADLINE: Workfare Must Train Participants for Real Jobs;
No Job Is Not an Option

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Nonprofit and Religious Groups Vow to Fight Workfare Program" (front page, July 24): 
 As a hospital social worker with five years' experience with the homeless and unemployed, I have concluded that if an able-bodied adult without small children cannot find any work after a number of years, to continue to provide such services for an indefinite period of time is a disservice to the recipient because all of life's needs are provided for, without effort. Most of the clients I have seen don't work because they don't have to.
Protesting New York City's workfare program with a sign that says "Rudy, We Will Not Be Your Slave Drivers," in effect calling Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani a slave master, will only inhibit change in our welfare system, one that has been waiting for some fine-tuning for two decades.

HEADLINE: Web Advertising Beyond Banners

BYLINE: By Nzong Xiong

 BODY:
As Internet users cruise around the World Wide Web, advertisments of all types line the roadside -- ads that are the functional equivalent of storefronts, with the merchants eager to lure people in to sample their goods. But luring is harder in a world without window displays.
 Advertisers started out in 1994 using simple banner ads, like roadside billboards. But advertisers were not totally satisfied with the banner and began looking for other models. "They haven't figured what ad form will be most effective and what should be in the ad," said Bill Doyle, senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "So advertisers are playing with all the levers right now." 
 And what have they found so far? Animated type, animated images, interactive trivia, banners that scroll along with news headlines in on-screen tickers, five-second pop-up windows and more. Last year, advertisers, particularly technology and business and financial services companies, spent $301 million advertising on the Internet, according to Marc Johnson, an on-line advertising analyst at Jupiter Communications in New York. In the first quarter of 1997 alone, $133 million was spent, he said.
Here are just some of the models out there already on the Internet. Nzong Xiong

HEADLINE: Mexicans in New York Search for a Toehold on a Crowded Ladder

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
The Irish who moved to Mott Haven in the 1860's searching for jobs are long gone, but the memory lingers at St. Jerome's Roman Catholic Church. The altar and sanctuary walls -- in marble of green, white and orange-yellow -- are a sly echo of the Irish colors. Above, huge stained-glass windows depict Bible scenes, like Jesus feeding the multitudes.
"They told stories in pictures," said the Rev. John Grange, who grew up in the neighborhood and is now the church's pastor. "People didn't know how to read." 
 Now a new generation is looking heavenward to learn the old stories. They come from Mexico, crowded into the red brick apartments that face the church on East 138th Street in the Bronx, where stores that sell tacos, tortillas and chiles have opened in recent years. In the evening, they turn the church's asphalt parking lot into a plaza where children play soccer while their parents lean against a chain-link fence to chat and rest after a day spent working as dishwashers, cooks and janitors.
As the newest arrivals in a city whose economy and neighborhoods are renewed each generation by waves of new arrivals, the Mexicans are at the bottom of the ladder in community influence, living conditions and earning power. The plight of 57 deaf Mexicans held in servitude in Queens while they sold trinkets in the subway trains was an extreme. But the everyday hardships of such an existence -- from shoddy housing to poor pay -- struck a common chord among the masses of their countrymen for whom such indignities are accepted as the unofficial price of undocumented life.
Tuesday night, two dozen men and women held hands in prayer before meeting at St. Jerome's to discuss the deaf Mexicans. Dora Madrigal and her friends had at one time or another silently suffered at the hands of landlords, employers and thugs, she said, a fear born of being in the country illegally. But the deaf Mexicans finally went to the police when their situation became unbearable.
"They have been an example to us," said Miss Madrigal, who became a citizen last week. "Those who could not speak, complained. What happens to those of us who can speak, but don't?"
They stay in New York and work, joining the estimated 200,000 Mexicans in the city who are trying to survive in a land that for them holds the promise of a better life as it did for the Irish, Italian and Jewish immigrants before them.
Too new to have become hyphenated Americans or fearful because of their undocumented status, they have yet to form the kinds of local associations that unite them and advocate for better jobs and housing. Nor have they sought the help of older Mexican-American advocacy groups that, while active on a national level, have yet to make major inroads into New York out of deference to established Puerto Rican and Dominican organizations.
Instead, they have carved out niches in the city, and more recently moved beyond, to upstate New York and New Jersey, enduring indignities in the hope that hard work will prove redemptive. But changes in the city's labor market have led to many Mexicans, unlike their predecessors, being clustered in low-paying jobs in restaurants, delis and sweatshops that could thwart their progress into the middle class.
"For the people coming in now, their chances to move up through nonskilled work or on-the-job training are more circumscribed," said Robert Smith, a professor of sociology at Barnard College who has studied the city's Mexican community. "Not only because the manufacturing jobs have left the city, but because there has been such a huge surge in immigration to New York there are a lot of other people before them in line to take those jobs."
 
A Trickle in the 40's, A Flow in the 80's
Mr. Smith's research has traced the Mexican immigration to New York to the early 1940's when two men from the state of Puebla arrived looking for work almost by accident. As word spread of their good fortune, others followed. Their numbers were fueled in the 1980's by Mexico's economic crisis, which hit Puebla especially hard, and now Poblanos account for about half of the Mexican immigrant population.
Mexican immigration boomed later in the decade when an amnesty resulted in formerly illegal residents sending for their families.
Mr. Smith said that he did not expect the North American Free Trade Agreement to generate enough manufacturing jobs in Mexico to offset the current migration. If anything, he said, he was seeing new immigrants coming from areas that had not previously sent large numbers of people.
"I don't think that Nafta will do anything to stop this," he said. "As you industrialize, you need less people to do the work. Also, investment will not be in places that have poor resources, the places that people are leaving. If it does anything, in the medium term, it will make it worse."
Jorge did not need to understand treaties to realize that his family would never escape poverty in Oaxaca as long as he made $3 a day at his construction job. "You cannot do anything with that," said Jorge, who refused to use his last name because he has been living illegally in New York since arriving four years ago. "You cannot eat."
It took him three months to find a job in a factory painting clothing for $3 an hour, he said. Although he had neither documents nor a command of English, it was not a problem.
"Where I worked, everybody spoke Spanish," he said. "Even the Jews spoke Spanish."
He now makes salads in a Manhattan restaurant, and the $6 an hour he is paid has helped buoy his family back home.
"It was definitely worth coming here," he said. "I have a house in Mexico. My family is better off. I'm not ready to leave New York. I like it."
 
In Land of Plenty, Not Enough for Some
But others are not so sure. The legions of immigrants who troop through the subways selling candy and their above-ground compatriots who sell fruits and flowers from carts complain that they are harassed by the police, overcharged by suppliers and assaulted by thugs. Some had tried to get licenses from the city, but the number is capped.
Jose Ramos, whose worn face belied his 38 years, had sold only two bouquets of red, white and blue carnations by 5 o'clock Monday afternoon. A customer handed him a ten-dollar bill and he had to scurry over to a coconut-ice vendor for change.
"One never comes here seeing the reality, so you think it's easy," said Mr. Ramos, a former farm worker who arrived in New York a year ago. "The people who come here see there is no work, so they take what they can, they take whatever they're paid. You sell all day and make $10, how can you survive? You can't."
Yet they manage by crowding into apartments where each room houses a family or in crumbling basements where they sleep in shifts. Many immigrants said that while competition for jobs was already fierce, they were increasingly worried about how tighter immigration laws would affect them. One reason New York had become a preferred destination was that its immigration authorities were seldom seen as a threat.
The recent Federal court decision that overturned the city's policy of not disclosing immigration status when residents sought services has also increased the fear and uncertainty. Ilze Betins, a social worker who directs El Faro Beacon Youth and Family Services in Spanish Harlem, said that many of her Mexican clients were already so fearful that they almost never gave out information like addresses and telephone numbers.
Eddie Baca, the executive director of the Local Development Corporation del Barrio, said that while the intent of the new policies was to root out illegal immigrants, they would accomplish the opposite. The need to make a dollar and the appetite of employers for cheap labor are too great, he said.
"It's a pipe dream," said Mr. Baca, who is of Mexican descent. "They're not going to leave."
Faced with a growing Mexican community in the city and what they perceive as a hostile political climate toward immigrants nationally, some of the more established Mexican-American organizations are considering expanding in New York.
The National Council of La Raza, which began as a Chicano advocacy group but increasingly has taken a pan-Hispanic approach, has been working with some New York nonprofit groups to reach out to the new immigrants, who themselves may be unfamiliar with what help is available.
"We are going to have to try and speed up the timetable a bit," said Charles Kamasaki, a senior vice president. "That's true with any group coming from a more authoritarian system where there is not a tradition of nonprofit organizations. It takes a while, at least a generation."
 
Looking to the Church For Comfort and Unity
Many immigrants said that apart from the soccer leagues started by the Mexican Consulate in the city, they seldom had contact with consular officials, whom they described as too bureaucratic and insufficiently involved in the communities. But many have turned to local churches for help with everything from housing to jobs.
Five years ago, hardly anyone attended the Mass on the Feast of Our Lady of Guadalupe. Now the December celebration of Mexico's Madonna attracts 1,000 worshipers, families with children who cram the church for a mariachi Mass.
"There's really no difference between them and the Irish," said Father Grange. "They eat rice and we ate potatoes. But the church is still important. You respect your parents and you try to study."
They are hard workers, he said, whose desire to earn a living had left them vulnerable to accepting starvation wages. In response, Father Grange started a cleaning service which now employs 100 Mexicans who make $10 an hour. Other parishioners have formed a savings group where they contribute $200 a month. Now they intend to pool their money in a health care cooperative.
"We're organizing as a group to have some unity," said Lucia Sanchez, a longtime parishioner. "Too often what happens happens, and everybody curses their luck. There has always been discrimination, but not like now. People don't want Mexicans. They don't respect Mexicans."
In Brooklyn, Fabiola Villagomez feels a bit cursed herself. She had told her dying uncle she would stay in Puebla and finish nursing school. She promised not to marry Gustavo, the country boy she had met while caring for her uncle. But Gustavo charmed her into breaking her blood vows to utter the vows of matrimony.
She lives in Bushwick with her husband in a room they rent in another Mexican family's apartment. He works in a clothing factory, saving for the house he is building back in Mexico. She stays at home, bored, wondering why she ever came to New York City in 1995 with no documents and no diploma. Her only job was a few months in a paper factory where she said she made $50 a week.
She stood in the shadow of the elevated train on Broadway, saddened by the recollection of her act of betrayal. She wore a New York City T-shirt, emblazoned with images of the Statue of Liberty, the World Trade Center towers and the masks of comedy and tragedy. Those, too, seemed like broken promises.
"I had imagined this city to be a palace, something beautiful," she said. "Not so much cruelty, racism or the ugly things in this country."
Still, some days she walks into Woodhull Hospital, if only to keep alive a stubborn hope.
"I go in just to watch the nurses and the patients," she said. "I close my eyes and imagine myself giving injections."

HEADLINE: Clinton Golfs And Attends Fund-Raiser In California

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, July 27

 BODY:
As negotiators in Washington worked to strike an agreement on budget and tax-cut legislation, President Clinton played golf today at a Los Angeles country club before raising money for Democrats who are seeking to regain control of the House of Representatives next year.
Halfway through a three-day trip that included an announcement of Federal assistance for Lake Tahoe on Saturday and a planned appearance before the National Governors Association in Las Vegas, Nev., on Monday, Mr. Clinton was the main draw at a fund-raising dinner here for Democratic candidates. 
 The President told a crowd sprinkled with celebrities such as Nancy Sinatra and Morgan Fairchild that a budget agreement could be near.
"This is a very good budget if we can resolve the remaining problems," Mr. Clinton said. "There is a tax cut in it. The tax cut ought to be fair to working families, it ought to put a primary emphasis on education, it ought to help the economy grow and it shouldn't explode in the later years so that we go right back to the deficits we just worked ourselves out of."
He appealed to his party to stand by his side. "I want us to make this balanced budget agreement tomorrow that I hope 90 percent plus of the Democrats will vote for."
The $5,000 a couple gathering raised more than $600,000. Democrats said a small portion of the money that was being raised was so-called "soft money,"the kind of unrestricted financing that President Clinton had called on Congress to ban as part of legislation to overhaul the campaign finance system.
Mr. Clinton's aides were unapologetic about the President's continuing efforts to bring in such donations for the Democrats who are gearing up for the midterm elections in 1998.
"We are playing by the current rules," said Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman. "We have no intention of unilaterally disarming."
Mr. Lockhart today also brushed off a call on the NBC news program "Meet the Press" by Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, for Mr. Clinton to become directly involved in the budget and tax-cut negotations taking place in Washington. Mr. Lockhart said the President had made his position clear on the crucial issues and had "absolute confidence" in the Administration officials who are bargaining on his behalf.
"If at an appropriate time he needs to become involved personally, he'll do that," Mr. Lockhart said.
As his aides manuevered back in Washington, the President spent most of his time in Los Angeles on Saturday night and on Sunday socializing with some of his party's most devoted donors.
On his way to California on Saturday aboard Air Force One, Mr. Clinton was already in a Hollywood mood, joking with reporters about the movie thriller 'Air Force One." He said his own plane was not quite as elaborate as the movie version. "As far as I know there is no escape pod," he said, "and I don't think we have quite the arsenal on there, and there's no back door."
Soon after landing here, Mr. Clinton went to Beverly Hills where he had dinner at the home of Lew R. Wasserman, the former chairman of MCA. A year ago, during the Presidential campaign, Mr. Wasserman held a $1 million fund-raising event for Mr. Clinton at his home with a star-studded guest list that included Neil Simon, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Geena Davis and Barbra Streisand.
This time, however, the President's aides said the gathering had nothing to do with raising money. Ms. Streisand was there again with her escort, the actor James Brolin. Also joining the President were Michael D. Eisner, the chairman of Walt Disney Company; Jack Valente, the president of the Motion Picture Association; Bud Yorkin, the television and film producer, and former Secretary of State Warren Christopher.
This morning, Mr. Clinton was out early for breakfast at the Santa Monica beach house of supermarket executive Ron Burkle. The President waved for a moment from a second-floor balcony to joggers, bicyclists and skaters who crowded an oceanside path below. Mr. Burkle, who has played host to several large fund-raising events for Mr. Clinton, was a vice chairmen of the President's second inauguration.
Not one to waste glorious golfing weather, Mr. Clinton then went to the Hillcrest Country Club with a golfing entourage of nine. The President teed off in a foursome that included Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles, a Republican.

HEADLINE: Major Budget Issues Settled, Gingrich Says

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, July 27

 BODY:
Speaker Newt Gingrich said tonight that Congressional Republicans and the Administration had settled all but "maybe three tiny issues" in their negotiations over tax cuts and a balanced budget and that he intended to introduce legislation by Monday night.
But a White House spokesman traveling with President Clinton in California disputed that assessment, saying that there were still "significant issues" to be resolved. Even some senior Republican aides involved in the negotiations were much more cautious than Mr. Gingrich. They said that a deal was indeed very close but some tough issues still had to be worked out and that the Speaker might have been trying to pressure Mr. Clinton. 
 "I think we have an agreement, but it's never done until it's done," Mr. Gingrich told reporters this evening before sitting down with Senator Trent Lott, the majority leader, and other Republican leaders at a meeting in his office.
He said only three small issues -- one on taxes and two on spending -- stood between a final deal, although he declined to give details.
But the White House spokesman traveling with President Clinton said in Los Angeles that Mr. Gingrich was premature in his observations.
"There are still significant issues to be worked out and until they're worked out, we don't have a deal," said the spokesman, Joe Lockhart.
Mr. Gingrich seemed undaunted by the Administration's response. As he left the meeting about 9:15 P.M., he said again that "no significant issues" remained to be negotiated.
"We're doing fine," he said "and basically we'll file the bill by tomorrow."
Another Republican aide involved in the discussions said party leaders had spent the day advising certain rank-in-file members, especially some of the hard-line conservatives, on the progress of the talks and had received favorable responses. The aide said Mr. Gingrich wanted to push legislation through the House as quickly as possible before it could be picked apart.
The conflicting signals on just where the negotiations stood came at the end of a day where there were much more concrete signs of progress in the talks.
The negotiators have kept an unusually tight lid on their discussions. But senior Republican aides who have been involved in the talks revealed a few of the details.
They said the two sides had compromised on what had been the major sticking point, a proposed $500-a-child tax credit.
The White House reportedly agreed that the tax credit would cover teen-agers as well as younger children and that families making more than $60,000 would receive the full credit. The Republicans, in turn, yielded to an Administration demand that low-income families with little or no income tax burden be allowed to receive the per-child tax credit based on the family's payroll tax.
Mr. Clinton wanted the $500 tax credit to apply to working families that made as little as $18,000 a year and who paid no income tax but owe payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. He said the tax credit should be phased our for families making $60,000 to $75,000 a year through 2000. After that, the Administration had proposed that the phase-out would range apply to families making $80,000 to $100,000.
Republicans had argued against giving the tax credit to working families that paid little or nor income taxes, saying that would be a form of welfare. In their original proposal, the tax credit would be phased out at $75,000 in family income.
Aides said this evening that they were still working out the details of the compromise plan.
Republicans and the White also agreed to reduce the capital gains tax to 20 percent from 28 percent, the aides said. But the Republicans backed down from their demand that investors not be taxed on investment profits that result from inflation, so-called indexing.
And it seemed certain that the tax bill will contain an increase on cigarette taxes -- to 44 cents a pack, from 24 cents -- and that most, if not all of it, would go toward health care for uninsured children.
Even before Mr. Gingrich's rosy comments tonight, Republicans had given clear signals of movement.
Senator Pete V. Domenici conceded earlier in the day on the CBS News program "Face the Nation," that "it seems to me that we're going to have some cigarette tax."
Mr. Lott also hinted at the cigarette tax increase in his appearance on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
But neither Mr. Domenici nor Mr. Lott would say whether the billions in revenue from such a tax increase would be used solely to provide health coverage for uninsured children from low-income families as the Administration had insisted.
And Representative Dick Armey, the House majority leader and Mr. Gingrich's second-in-command, had confirmed that negotiators were nearing an agreement on the child tax credit.
"We're trying to fit the President's detail into our principles and it's a very difficult fit to be made," Mr. Armey said on the ABC News program "This Week," "but we can get there."
Republicans hope to reach an agreement and approve a tax cut and balanced budget legislation before Friday, when Congress is due to begin a monthlong recess. The Republicans want to be able to go home to tell voters that they had succeeded on two of their biggest goals.
But Democratic leaders in the Senate and the House, and all nine Democrats on the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, urged Mr. Clinton on Friday to extend the negotiations until September if necessary to win concessions from the Republicans.
Each side has spent the last few days posturing. Mr. Lott also used his television appearance to try to turn up the political pressure on Mr. Clinton, urging him to get directly involved in the negotiations on tax cuts and a balanced budget "to make it happen."
"I think right now what we need is the President to engage some," Mr. Lott said. "He's got to be prepared to make some concessions to get some."
Mr. Clinton, Mr. Lott and Mr. Gingrich were directly involved in reaching the broad deal for the tax cuts and for balancing the budget by 2002. But Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and Erskine B. Bowles, the White House chief of staff have been in the current talks.
Although the President began a three-day trip to the West on Friday, he has been kept up to date on the negotiations, aides said.
"We are there speaking for the President, with specific instructions from him," Gene Sperling, Mr. Clinton's economic policy adviser, said on the CNN program "Late Edition."

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Defense Lawyer Weighs Paternity Suit in Cosby Extortion Case

BYLINE: By BENJAMIN WEISER

 BODY:
What is next for Autumn Jackson? After her conviction Friday in a scheme to extort $40 million from Bill Cosby by threatening to sell a story that she was his daughter, her lawyer, Robert M. Baum, stood outside the Federal Courthouse in Manhattan and discussed her options, which include a paternity suit.
With Ms. Jackson facing as many as 12 years in prison, Mr. Baum said he would ask Judge Barbara S. Jones to consider the unusual circumstances of the case and not incarcerate his 22-year-old client. He said he would also appeal her conviction. 
 A paternity suit, Mr. Baum said by telephone yesterday, could compel Mr. Cosby to take a blood test and allow Ms. Jackson to prove whether she is his daughter.
But even if the judge allows a paternity suit to go forward -- most are filed on behalf of minors -- the strategy carries a big risk.
Suppose the suit established that Mr. Cosby was not her father. That would end a mystery that seemed to cause some opinions of Ms. Jackson to be more favorable. During her trial, some columnists portrayed Ms. Jackson sympathetically and criticized Mr. Cosby for not living up to parental obligations. Some sympathy might remain, but only for a young woman whose mother misled her from the age of 5, telling her that she was the actor's daughter.
One of Mr. Cosby's lawyers, Andrew Schau, said yesterday that Mr. Cosby has been willing to take a paternity test -- but only if the man listed on Ms. Jackson's birth certificate as her father, Jerald Jackson, takes one first -- and fails.
Mr. Baum, meanwhile, acknowledged the strategy carried some risk. "But Autumn would like to know, as she has always wanted to know, and establish her legitimacy."
 
The Extortion Paradox
At one point during closing arguments, Mr. Baum told the jury: "Autumn Jackson had a right to sell her story. Autumn Jackson had a right to ask her father to negotiate a settlement of her rights. "Two rights don't make a wrong," he added.
But prosecutors say that two rights do make a wrong, when they constitute a threat to harm someone's reputation, accompanied by a demand for money. The disagreement highlights an age-old legal debate about what one lawyer calls the paradox of extortion and blackmail (the terms are often used interchangeably).
"The reason blackmail has exerted fascination for scholars is that it's a profoundly mysterious offense," said Leo Katz, professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and author of the book, "Ill-Gotten Gains: Evasion, Blackmail, Fraud, and Kindred Puzzles of the Law."
"What makes it mysterious is that you are threatening to do something which you are perfectly entitled to do, and you are asking for a benefit in return for not doing it," he said.
James Lindgren, a law professor at Northwestern University who has written extensively on blackmail and extortion, said: "It's hard to see when you're doing things that individually are not wrong. It's not wrong to go to the tabloids, not wrong to make public claims about someone being your father, not wrong to ask for money.
"What's wrong," he said, "is when you use the explicit leverage of public disgrace to get what you want."
Some economists and lawyers have debated why blackmail and extortion are crimes in the first place. Paul Shechtman, a former top Federal prosecutor in Manhattan who performed an economic analysis of blackmail with Douglas H. Ginsburg, now a Federal Court of Appeals judge, found an economic rationale for keeping it a crime. Legalizing blackmail, he said, would spawn an entire industry that would dredge up secrets to conceal again for a price.
"As a general matter, it's not in anybody's economic interest to have people dig up dirt and rebury it," Mr. Shechtman said.
In any case, the extortion and blackmail riddle has not given prosecutors much pause. "Prosecutors have been prosecuting, blissfully ignorant of the debate," Mr. Shechtman said. And they have been winning convictions as well.
 
Not on the Court's TV
So why didn't the jury ever see "Down on the Farm With Chocolate Chips and the Prairie Dog Club"?
That was the children's television program that Ms. Jackson and her co-defendant, Jose Medina, claimed to be developing when the Government charged them with extortion.
"The story is about an angel, who is both a scarecrow and Indian medicine man, and his three child angel companions," Ms. Jackson wrote in a document introduced as evidence.
But when Mr. Medina's lawyer, Neil B. Checkman, hoping to show that Mr. Medina had been involved in a legitimate venture, told Judge Jones in her robing room that he wanted to play snippets from "Down on the Farm," maybe 15 minutes in all, she did not seem too enthusiastic about premiering the show in court.
"Fifteen minutes actually sounds like a lot of time to me," the judge said. "Is there any way to cut it back a little bit?"
Mr. Checkman discussed his plans further, joking, "We are not going to charge admission to this."
But last Monday, he said that he would not show the video, only introduce the script.
Would he be reading it to the jurors? Judge Jones asked.
Mr. Checkman said he would not, "though after the trial is over," he added, "they are welcome to a reenactment."
"We are on the same wavelength," the judge said, ending the matter.

HEADLINE: At CUNY, a Debate on Grade Inflation

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
How many A's and B's should a college give? And how many students should graduate with honors?
At the City University of New York, about half the course grades given are A's and B's. To Herman Badillo, vice chairman of the board of trustees, that is too many. 
 In calling for higher standards at the campuses, Mr. Badillo has repeatedly said that professors are cheapening the university by grading too leniently and granting too many honors. And he has accused the outgoing Chancellor, W. Ann Reynolds, of tolerating grade inflation. Dr. Reynolds announced July 17 that she was resigning after months of such criticism to become President of the University of Alabama's Birmingham campus.
"In the entire university, more than half of the students get A's and B's," Mr. Badillo said recently. "This is a disgrace."
He said he was also dismayed that more than half the graduates at Brooklyn College, a four-year college in the university, take honors. That suggests, he said, that "the students at Brooklyn College are the most brilliant in the country, and I don't believe it."
But to some CUNY faculty members, Mr. Badillo's charges amount to a gratuitous attack.
"The charge of grade inflation is absurd," said Bill Crain, a psychology professor at City College, speaking at a news conference in front of City Hall last week. "The charge is really distorted and wrong, and is politically motivated. City University has always graded much tougher than other public universities, and certainly than private universities and colleges in the United States."
Both sides agree on the data. At all but one of the university's four-year colleges, between 40 and 60 percent of the course grades given in the fall semester of 1995 were A's or B's, and at City, Hunter, Lehman and Queens, the rate was between 50 and 60 percent. The highest rate was at Lehman, 59 percent. The rate at Medgar Evers was the lowest, 33 percent.
At the university's six community colleges, the rate was somewhat lower; the proportion of A's or B's in course grades in the fall of 1995 ranged from 40 percent at Queensborough to 51 percent at La Guardia.
But here Mr. Badillo and his critics part company. Mr. Badillo says that those figures are simply too high, and that they put the graduates at a disadvantage. "It undermines the value of the diploma," he said. "Anyone who says this is not happening is in a very serious state of denial."
He said that he believed standards had been lowered because so many of the university's students are members of minorities -- about 55 percent are either African-American or Hispanic. "The politically correct thing is to say the bar should be lowered and that standards should be lowered for blacks and Latinos," Mr. Badillo said. "As a Puerto Rican, I resent that. I competed with other students and still came out on top."
But some City University professors say Mr. Badillo and other trustees and politicians are focusing only on students with the greatest problems, not the top students.
"My classes are superb," said Ed Kent, a philosophy professor at Brooklyn College. "The new waves of immigrants have stronger early educations than the typical American high school student," he said. "They just need to catch up with expanding their vocabularies in English."
Dean Savage, a sociology professor at Queens College, said an independent measure of the quality of City University students was the number who pursued graduate degrees. He said the proportion of graduates from Brooklyn, City, Hunter and Queens who earned Ph.D.'s between 1989 and 1993 was greater than the 3.4 percent national average.
And he and other university professors said their standards were neither lower than those at other colleges nor lower than they were in the past. They pointed to figures from a study of 21,000 student transcripts by the United States Department of Education, which showed that 59 percent of all course grades given to undergraduate students at four-year colleges were A's or B's.
"CUNY's grading sounds about the same," said Clifford Adelman, the senior research analyst at the Department of Education who headed the study. He said that grade point averages at very selective colleges, like the Ivy League, tended to be even higher than those at public universities.
Some City University professors also said there had been little change in their grading systems since World War II. Although there is no centralized data going back that far, grades at one university college, Queens, show only a tiny increase over 50 years, from 2.6 in 1946 to 2.7 today. Like many American colleges, Queens saw a rise in grades in the late 1960's -- its average grade point average climbed to 3.3 in 1970. But then, as on other campuses, grades fell back. Its average grade point average has been roughly constant at about 2.7 since 1980.
A spot check of other public university systems found 2.7 to be below some other major public universities. At the University of Florida, for example, the average grade point average was 3.0 in 1995. At the University of Virginia, it was 3.1 last year. And at the University of Michigan, it was 3.1 in the winter of 1997 and 3.0 in the fall quarter of 1996.
Of course, none of those figures are true measures. Grade inflation is difficult to judge, particularly because it is harder to determine whether classes are graded tougher now than in another period.
As for honors, Brooklyn College does give honors diplomas to students with lower averages than many other colleges, including most other City University colleges. Brooklyn's grade distribution is slightly lower than some of the other colleges -- about 50 percent of its students have A or B averages. But it requires only a 3.0 average for a cum laude degree, the same standard it has used since it was founded in 1930. The university's other four-year colleges set higher minimums, ranging from 3.2 at Baruch, City and John Jay, to 3.5 at Queens.

The City University of New York is under fire by trustees who say it is inflating grades. While most CUNY colleges are giving more A's and B's, Medgar Evers is actually giving out fewer.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK ACCORD ON HOSPITALS AID SETS OFF DEBATE

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: ALBANY, July 27

 BODY:
New York's aging, ailing hospitals, buffeted by market competition and bracing for an overhaul of Medicaid, have been thrown a lifeline: $1.25 billion in Federal aid over five years to reinvent themselves for the age of managed care.
The money is part of an agreement reached by the Clinton and Pataki administrations last week that for the first time would require most of New York's 3.1 million Medicaid recipients to enroll in health maintenance organizations. The organizations seek to hold down costs by focusing on preventive medicine and limiting access to such things as costly emergency room visits and lengthy hospital stays. 
 Supporters of the aid package say it will offer crucial support to public and nonprofit hospitals, many of them in New York City's poorer neighborhoods, as they struggle to compete and cut costs by establishing networks of neighborhood clinics, retraining workers to provide outpatient services and setting up managed care plans.
Many of these hospitals already face financial crisis, caught between increasingly powerful health maintenance organizations that demand reduced rates for their private paying customers, and state and Federal officials who want to balance their budgets by cutting billions of dollars in hospital payments.
But critics of the deal, particularly health care analysts, say it is a wasteful taxpayer bailout of an inefficient system that has stubbornly refused to adapt to changes in the marketplace.
They say that the money, like subsidies to other struggling industries, from tobacco farming to military contracting, could help keep health care costs artificially high. And they question why it was given exclusively to hospitals and not to the scores of nonprofit community clinics that have become the main providers of primary medical care in many of the state's poorest communities.
"The Government is helping these hospitals adapt, which is really not the responsibility of the Government," said Kenneth S. Abramowitz, a health care analyst at the Sanford C. Bernstein & Company securities firm. "These organizations should have adapted on their own. This just prolongs the agony."
But as is the case with most government subsidies, politics played an important role in guaranteeing this one. Both President Clinton, a Democrat, and Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, had been under intense pressure from powerful union leaders and local politicians who rely on the hospitals not only to provide medical care but also to pump jobs and money into many neighborhoods in New York, particularly poorer ones.
"The question is, does this money just subsidize an inefficient system," said Andrew Rein, a research associate for the Citizen's Budget Commission, a budget watchdog group financed by private businesses, "or will it truly help provide a smooth transition for these hospitals to provide care for the poor?"
President Clinton has already approved plans by 13 states to force Medicaid recipients into managed care. But New York's plan stands out because it includes the grants to about 80 public and nonprofit hospitals across the state. The money is given to hospitals that meet two criteria: admissions totaling 5,000 or more annually, with at least 20 percent of that figure including people who are uninsured or on Medicaid.
Federal and state officials insist that New York is not being given a handout, because the $1.25 billion aid package represents money that the Federal Government will save as a result of the state's Medicaid patients moving into managed care.
Many health care experts, union leaders and politicians contend that New York's hospitals need the money, perhaps more than most other hospitals, because they have had a harder time coping with the changes that have transformed the nation's medical industry in recent years.
For one thing, they say, New York's hospitals are financially among the nation's weakest, because they have high debt and low profit margins. Also, the hospitals have for years relied on government insurers to underwrite charity care and pay for the costly, unprofitable emergency room care they provide to patients who do not have private doctors. Last year, hospitals in New York spent about $1.5 billion to care for uninsured people, particularly in poor neighborhoods, according to the Greater New York Hospital Association.
The experts say that the state's hospitals also face a sudden pressure that hospitals elsewhere do not face now: Lawmakers in Albany agreed last year to abolish the state's decades-old policy of setting rates that hospitals can charge. That allowed insurance companies for the first time to negotiate their fees with hospitals, a right that only managed care companies had up to that point, initiating a new era of fierce competition in the hospital industry.
Experts say that the demands on New York's hospitals, particularly those with high numbers of poor patients, will only deepen as a result of last week's decision by the Federal Government to stop the practice of generally paying hospitals for each procedure they perform on Medicaid recipients. Instead, the hospitals will get a set fee for each Medicaid recipient enrolled in a managed care plan, no matter what their ailment or where they are treated.
The proponents of the aid package also maintain that helping hospitals is essential to the state's effort to place most of its 3.1 million Medicaid recipients into H.M.O.'s. That plan will fail, they say, unless the hospitals play a larger role in running primary care clinics and other outpatient services that are essential to any managed care system.
"The biggest question is, are the hospitals ready to absorb the shell shock you incur when you go into a competitive environment?" Kenneth E. Raske, the president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, said. "The money will help hospitals cope with the changes."
New York's medical industry, more than most others, heavily depends on hospitals to deliver care, with its admission rate at 131 for every 1,000 people treated. By contrast, in California, a state widely regarded as a pioneer in managed care, the admission rate is 94 for every 1,000 people treated, according to the American Hospital Association's 1995 Annual Survey of Hospitals. New York also has longer hospital stays, an average of nine days for each person, compared with five days for each person in California.
Those figures mean that the average number of days in the hospital for every 1,000 New Yorkers is 1,179, compared with 470 days for every 1,000 Californians. Some experts believe the difference is explained by the fact that doctors in New York tend to admit patients to hospitals to diagnose potentially grave illnesses, whereas their counterparts in California tend to use outpatient centers.
"We need to invest in building more capacity" in the area of primary care, said Jeffrey Sachs, a health care adviser for 1199, the National Health and Human Service Employees Union, which lobbied for aid to hospitals. "The money will help to build the facilities that will hopefully attract the physicians into inner-city communities."
But critics of the deal contend that a pattern of handouts to the state's largest industry is already beginning to emerge. For example, they point to the recent decision by the Federal Government to make special payments to hospitals that agree to train fewer doctors. They describe that deal as a subsidy to an industry with powerful political ties at a time when hospitals elsewhere are struggling to hold down costs.
The objection to the latest aid package stems largely from the fact that New York already has a glut of hospital beds that are going unused. The critics maintain that allowing a few hospitals to close would yield much-needed savings in the industry by eliminating fixed costs like the maintenance of aging buildings, among other things.
Jeff Goldsmith, a health care analyst with Health Futures Inc. in Charlotte, Va., contends that hospital closings will free money that can be invested in building primary care networks. That is why he questions the decision to pump yet more public money into hospitals that are already too dependent on such financing. "I think this is a questionable investment of public money," he said. "This is like crops support."
But Kenneth E. Thorpe, the director of the Institute for Health Services Research at Tulane University Medical Center, says things are not that simple. He agrees that a few hospital closings would be far more cost-effective than the alternative now being pursued: helping the industry as a whole scale back the number of unneeded beds it has accumulated.
But Mr. Thorpe also acknowledges that there is a risk to allowing the free market alone to determine the fate of New York's hospitals at this stage: Struggling hospitals in low-income neighborhoods would probably be the first to close, meaning that the poorest New Yorkers would be left with little or no medical care.
That is the concern that drove many officials to push the Federal Government to provide the aid package to New York's hospitals.
The debate over the aid package has centered on another important question: Why did the deal not include money for community health clinics that for years played important roles in poor neighborhoods by building networks of primary care physicians when others would not? Would it not make sense, critics ask, to infuse these clinics with money to modernize and expand, particularly since they have often done a better job than hospitals in delivering basic care? Beyond that, they ask, why allow hospitals to build new clinics, as some have suggested, when these others already exist?
The money is particularly important for the roughly 80 clinics across New York State because about 50 percent of their patients are Medicaid recipients, according to the Community Health Care Association of New York State, a group that represents the clinics.
For their part, the administrations of both Governor Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said they would like to see some of the money used to help clinics do things like hire more doctors and expand their buildings.
In fact, Dr. Rosa M. Gil, the director for Health Services in the Giuliani administration, says that much of the $500 million the city will receive for its hospitals will be spent on expanding existing community health clinics, not building new ones. "We believe the funding should be to enhance what we have, not to build new clinics," she said. "The last resort will be to create new clinics."

HEADLINE: Workfare Must Train Participants for Real Jobs;
Workfare's Dark Side

 BODY:

To the Editor:
We would like to clarify one crucial issue raised by your July 24 front-page article on the campaign to protest New York City's workfare program. 
 The article referred to "workfare employees." The city vigorously insists that workfare workers are not employees and, therefore, do not qualify for laws guaranteeing payment of prevailing wages, the right to organize, or health and safety protections. Workfare workers are also not eligible for overtime, promotion, the earned income tax credit, unemployment insurance or Social Security.
The city wants to have it both ways. First, it points to valuable services provided by workfare workers, for which the city would otherwise have to hire regular employees. Then, it turns around and claims that workfare is just a transitional training program.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Coliseum Plan Threatens Lincoln Center Expansion

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's sudden call for a large theater to be built as part of the redevelopment of the New York Coliseum has called into question Lincoln Center's own plan to build another theater four blocks away.
A Lincoln Center official said yesterday that there was no room for two theaters so close to each other. 
 In threatening on Saturday to veto the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's leading choice of a developer for the Coliseum site, Mayor Giuliani said he felt it was "enormously important" that the project be redesigned to include a theater of 1,000 to 2,000 seats, for jazz, opera or Broadway performances.
But officials at Lincoln Center have been negotiating for months to build an intimate theater at Broadway and 64th Street to complement the 3,000-seat New York State Theater and the 3,800-seat Metropolitan Opera. And as one executive at Lincoln Center said of the Mayor's preference, "We're not interested in two theaters."
Mr. Giuliani's aides said yesterday that adding a theater to the Coliseum site at Columbus Circle was likely to lower the price a developer would pay the Metropolitan Transportation Authority for the property, because a theater would have to replace a commercial tenant that could afford a higher rent.
Neither Millenium Partners, the authority's leading choice to redevelop the site, nor the four other finalists have yet incorporated a theater in their plans.
Lincoln Center, meanwhile, has been negotiating since the beginning of the year with Millenium on a different project, at 1926 Broadway, where the company offered to build a multipurpose theater of up to 1,200 seats as part of a high-rise building with retail stores and apartments.
Lincoln Center was to have depended largely on the city to pay for that theater, officials said. About 40 percent of the cost would have come from the city's Trust for Cultural Resources, which would have issued bonds to be paid off with the additional tax revenue generated by the rest of Millennium's project. In addition, 20 percent would have come from the city's capital budget.
Aides to the Mayor said the project directly opposite Lincoln Center's fountain plaza had encountered problems with zoning and had apparently stalled.
Regardless, an executive at a Lincoln Center organization, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the city's control of financing gave the Mayor nearly total control over a new theater site.
Executives at the transportation authority and Millennium did not return telephone calls yesterday seeking comment. Nathan Leventhal, the president of Lincoln Center, declined to comment.
Randy Levine, the Deputy Mayor for Economic Development, Planning and Administration, said Mr. Giuliani's desire for a theater on Columbus Circle should not surprise the would-be developers. "The Mayor's been talking about it for months," he said. "The developers knew about it, the M.T.A. knew about it. It's been no secret."
One city official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that building a theater at the Coliseum site could cost $15 million, compared to a total cost for the project of around $300 million. "If I were the developer, I'd ask the M.T.A. to give them that much off the purchase price," the official said. "Wouldn't you?"
Mayor Giuliani had long wanted some cultural or public use to be incorporated into the Coliseum site, such as additional ballroom space for conventions, or the Manhattan outpost of an institution like the Brooklyn Museum, said John S. Dyson, chair of the Mayor's Council of Economic Advisers and a city representative on the authority board.
The Mayor, an opera enthusiast, began pushing for a new theater at the Coliseum after Mr. Leventhal and Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center's board of directors, met with him to discuss the center's need for space, Mr. Dyson said.
One of the most likely tenants of any new theater is the Jazz at Lincoln Center program, whose artistic director, Wynton Marsalis, has yet to find it a permanent home. The Metropolitan Opera has conducted an on-again, off-again search for a performance space more suitable than the Met for light opera. And Christyne Lategano, the Mayor's director of communications, said Broadway producers had also expressed interest in another large theater. Most Broadway houses seat between 600 and 1,000 people.
"The people at Lincoln Center may well prefer to be on Central Park West or Broadway," Mr. Dyson said. "But in truth, this is going to be a wonderful destination."

CORRECTION-DATE: July 29, 1997, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's call for a new theater on the site of the New York Coliseum paraphrased the reaction of a Lincoln Center official incorrectly. The official, who spoke on the condition that he would not be named, said that Lincoln Center, which has been seeking to build a theater of its own at Broadway and 64th Street, did not need two new theaters for itself. He did not say that the area could not accommodate two new theaters.
In addition, the phrasing of the headline exceeded the scope of the article. The Mayor's proposed theater at the Coliseum could be incorporated into the Lincoln Center expansion; it would not threaten the expansion. Further developments in the situation are reported today on page B3.

HEADLINE: Jewish Voyagers to the New World Emerging From History's Mists

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS 

 BODY:
AN enduring image of the earliest Europeans to arrive in the New World, with help from Hollywood, is an overdressed Conquistador, crucifix or sword held high, spreading salvation among the indigenous population.
That concept is now undergoing re-evaluation. For hidden under his breastplate, in spirit if not in fact, may well have been a Star of David; the crucifix more protective cover than symbol of a crusading zeal. 
 For the Jews were far more significant in the earliest exploration, settlement and development of the Caribbean and South America than has previously been acknowledged.
Why and how this happened and why it has received scant attention was the theme of a recent conference at the John Carter Brown Library at Brown University. Called "The Jews and the Expansion of Europe to the West," it brought together about 30 scholars from as far afield as Brazil and Holland and disciplines from economic history to anthropology.
The main organizers were the library and the Touro National Heritage Trust, an affiliate of the Touro Synagogue in Newport, R.I.
The chief reason for years of oversight, scholars agreed, had to do with definition: virtually all Jews playing a significant role in the earliest development of the New World were involuntary converts, known interchangeably as New Christians, Conversos or Marranos. They had been coerced into conversion in the bloody period of persecution and elimination of Judaism in Spain and Portugal at the close of the 15th century.
No wonder the bright prospects of a newly discovered faraway land an ocean away from persecution and filled with untold riches provoked a heavy wave of Jewish migration. The trade potential was especially appealing to these Iberian or Sephardic Jews, expert international traders since the Middle Ages, when they had been a significant presence throughout the Mediterranean.
Conference presentations were dotted with colorful stories. Consider that of the covert Jewish Conquistador Alonso de Avila. He first enlists in the army of Hernando Cortes -- as a bookkeeper. In appreciation for accounting services rendered, he is then made the first mayor of the newly created city of Veracruz. But the glory is fleeting. He is arrested as a relapsed Jew by the Mexican Inquisition, accused of keeping a crucifix under his writing table and stepping on it -- a common but spurious charge, said Dr. Eva Alexandra Uchmany of the Universidad Nacional in Mexico, who told the story.
Other Iberian Inquisition practices gave these migrations a further boost. Dr. Geraldo Pieroni, professor of history at the University of Brasilia, told how deportation to Brazil was a customary sentence meted out by the Portuguese Inquisition in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.
Dr. Anita Novinsky, a professor of history at the University of San Paulo, estimated that in the region around Rio de Janeiro and the state of Bahia, New Christians constituted 20 percent of the European population by the 17th and 18th centuries; the number rose to50 percent in the Paraiba region near Recife, the core of the lucrative sugar trade.
Today, she said, so many Brazilians are eager to retrace their family lineages that organizations are forming for people who believe they come from New Christian stock and want to reclaim their Jewish ancestry. It is known in Spanish as "la sangre llama" (the blood is calling), said Mordechai Arbell, a former Israeli ambassador to Colombia, Panama and Haiti, and a specialist on Caribbean Jewry. The first 23 Jews to arrive in New York Harbor, in September 1654, scholars noted, were Brazilians descended from New Christians who returned to Judaism.
By the early 18th century, half the European population of Suriname, then a territory of the Netherlands, was Jewish, reported Dr. Wim Klooster, a Dutch historian. In Suriname, they could come out of the religious closet, having won freedom of worship under the more tolerant Dutch. They were considered so important to the economic well-being of Suriname that they were given the right "to labor on Sundays." A thriving agricultural village on the Suriname River in the early 1700's was called Joden Savanne (Jewish Savannah).
In Dutch Curacao, Jewish importance to the commercial viability of the settlement was deemed sufficient to allow Jewish schools to stay open on Sunday. Jewish ships plying the Atlantic carried such names as the Mazel Tov or Bekeerde Jood (converted Jew), Dr. Klooster said.
The researchers said Jewish success resulted mainly from tight family networks, which created what were essentially international corporations. These emerged as other family members, also under constant jeopardy from Inquisition spies, sought refuge in the more tolerant societies of Amsterdam, western France and London.
From there they could provide the reliable shipping, credit and trading links for a nascent commerce coping with risky voyages over thousands of windswept miles and prey to dishonest captains and sneak attacks by warring nations and pirates. The family networks also kept members accountable to one another.
"Those who could minimize risk were destined to become the most successful players," said Dr. John J. McCusker, a professor of economics at Trinity University in San Antonio.
Dr. Silvia Marzagalli, a French maritime historian from the University of Bordeaux, told how youthful family members would first be sent to Amsterdam for a commercial education and then on to the Caribbean to serve as company agents. Marriages were arranged with an eye toward expanding the network.
These settlers all still spoke a common language -- either Judeo-Spanish, also known as Ladino, or Portuguese. This seamlessly knit openly practicing Jews and their New Christian relatives in British, Dutch, French, Spanish and Portuguese-speaking domains.
One measure of their success, scholars noted, was constant accusations of unfair competition and of practicing black arts through the use of secret signs and symbols; Judeo-Spanish was often written using Hebrew characters. Another was the arrival of the Inquisition in the New World. "A Castillian of pure stock has not a ghost of a show against these Portuguese," one participant testified in a Peruvian Inquisition trial, according to Dr. Irene Silverblatt, a cultural anthropologist at Duke University.
On one occasion in the 1600's, Lima was plunged into economic chaos after the mass arrest and execution of the city's leading merchants, all of them New Christians, she said.
In the final analysis, despite the economic success of these New Christians, they lost out in the larger historical sweepstakes; they were scorned by Old Christian society and, for the most part, overlooked by Jewish history.

Another Loophole Bonanza

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER 

 BODY:
They call it a tax cut. Don't believe it. What's really happening is the construction of 10,000 new loopholes in a tax law already packed with special breaks for favored groups.
The new loopholes will compound the complexity of a tax code already more complicated than a barrel of snakes. 
 A tax cut is when they say, "Ah, you lucky Americans, we're reducing the rate on everybody's taxes." The bill being cooked up in Washington does not say that. It does not cut rates across the board. The cuts are for preferred customers only.
All we're talking about is a writhing mass of loopholes meant to pay off political debts and court various voter blocs.
Is my forecast of 10,000 new loopholes excessive? True, I made it up without help from my economists. I don't have any economists.
I mean no slander against economists when pointing out that theirs is an uncertain trade. Even the great Greenspan (Alan, chairman of the Federal Reserve), who has access to the best economists the world has to offer -- even the great Greenspan didn't know that the big bull market was going to go on forever.
And so a few months back he tried to cool everybody off, only to find, as of yesterday, that the big bull market is indeed going to go on forever.
Unless, of course, it doesn't. Often in economics, things that ought to go on forever, such as stock market hounds getting fatter by the day, stop going on forever. Afterward, economists tell you why; for predicting, though, they are not that great.
What effect the new tax-loophole bill might have on anything depends on which side's economists you believe, but there are so many differing economists' forecasts that all you can get from reading them is a headache.
Why get a headache?
I make up my own statistics using hard-gained experience, folk wisdom and wild guesses, then discount for the virtual certainty that nothing will ever turn out the way you think it will.
And so when I say the new loophole bill will create 10,000 new loopholes, I say it not with the economist's respect for statistical data, but with the reasonable certainty of a man who has watched tax laws come and tax laws go for nigh on half a century.
That experience leaves me persuaded that when 50,000 corporation tax lawyers and 50,000 corporation tax accountants sink their teeth into a nice juicy new tax bill they can always find at least 10,000 new loopholes.
Much of the fanciest mental produce of the Ivy League law schools devotes its life to uncovering tax dodges hiding in the latest tax laws. The most brilliant accounting graduates of our great schools of business and finance are on the job in behalf of organizations that pay extremely well for experts who can ferret out hidden tax-law goodies.
Ten thousand loopholes? It is almost as certain as a sun rising in the east tomorrow.
Much publicity has attached to the gross favors being done for the uptown swells in the loophole bill, but fatties are not its only beneficiaries.
Do you have children? Tough bun if you don't, because a new $500-a-kid tax credit is yours only if you do. This scheme evokes a macabre memory of Nazi Germany, which used government incentives to raise the birth rate. If you want a tax cut, procreate.
A loophole to encourage parents to send the kids to college? Surely the colleges, whose prices rise with the speed of Jack's beanstalk, will lose no time lapping up the benefits of this one.
We probably deserve absurdities like this loophole bill for our hatred of real tax reform. With the widening gap between haves and have-nots, sensible policy might be to cut the rates for the lower income brackets and raise them for the uppers.
A monstrous thing to say, isn't it? I can't believe I said it. What am I, O merciless mouthpieces of Talk Radio World? A liberal, elitist, big-taxer, tax-and-spend Ivory Tower resident? Oh, shame!
Yet in the 1950's rates in the upper brackets rose to over 90 percent, and it was the golden age of the American economy.

HEADLINE: A Dynamic Farewell From a Longtime Rights Leader

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, July 28

 BODY:
He preached and beseeched. He bounced and denounced.
And by the time the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery completed his rhyming, rollicking farewell address as president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference today, a capacity crowd at the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church had been reminded why Mr. Lowery, a Methodist preacher, is considered one of the civil rights movement's most powerful -- and colorful -- orators and spokesmen. 
 In his 40 years with the conference, the group he helped found with his two predecessors, the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rev. Ralph D. Abernathy, Mr. Lowery has thrived as the master of the bon mot. He has battled segregation and discrimination not only with his actions but also with his carefully crafted words.
Mr. Lowery's eyes twinkled impishly today as he, at 75, delivered one witticism after another, always in the singular cadence and idiom of the black church that nurtured him and his movement.
Speaking of the need for black Americans to free themselves from self-hatred and substance abuse, for instance, he offered this Loweryism: "If you can take care of the internal, you can easily take care of the external. Then you can avoid the infernal and latch on to the eternal."
And in defending affirmative action, the cause with which he is most identified these days, he said: "When the government, by public policy, kept you out, the government has a responsibility, by public policy, to bring you in. And it needs to be just as intentional about including you as it was about excluding you."
As president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference for 20 years, Mr. Lowery has preserved and refocused an organization that grew out of segregationist times that no longer exist. Without Jim Crow as a catalyst for action, he has turned the group's attention to economic issues like affirmative action and minority business development, as well as fighting the explosion of violent crime and AIDS among blacks.
To honor his 40-year career with the organization, the conference has dedicated its annual convention here this week to paying tribute. It did so at a gala on Sunday night that featured a videotaped message from President Clinton, as well as speeches by movement like Coretta Scott King and Andrew J. Young.
Mrs. King, the widow of Dr. King, called Mr. Lowery "a history maker and a soul shaker."
Mr. Young, a former mayor of Atlanta and United States representative at the United Nations, said Mr. Lowery had "kept the torch aglow."
The Rev. Jesse Jackson called Mr. Lowery "an enduring figure" who has been underappreciated. In an apparent reference to Dr. King, Mr. Jackson said there had been "so much focus on the work of Moses as the leader who first broke the line that there was not ever adequate appreciation for Joshua, who organized the subsequent battles."
The primary sponsor of the tribute dinner was Shoney's, the restaurant chain that was sued for racial discrimination in the early 1990's and then signed financial covenants with the conference under pressure from Mr. Lowery. The agreements call on the company to spend nearly $200 million on promoting minority employment and business development.
Mr. Lowery's retirement signals a generational transition for the organization and, by extension, for the civil rights movement as a whole. After his departure, the group will no longer be led by one of the Alabama preachers who came together to fight for the desegregation of buses in Montgomery, and then of public accommodations and polling places around the South.
Indeed, the organization seems stymied, at least for now, in searching for a successor. After Mr. Lowery spoke, board officials announced that he had agreed to stay on for 90 days as the search continues.
The group had been scheduled to elect a successor on Wednesday.
Among those who have interviewed for the job, said several officials, are Dr. King's son Martin Luther King 3d, a former county commissioner in Atlanta; Dr. Abernathy's son Ralph David Abernathy 3d, a Georgia state senator; Walter E. Fauntroy, a board member and a former Congressional delegate from the District of Columbia, and Earl T. Shinhoster, a former director of the Atlanta regional office of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
Mr. Lowery said he did not plan to retire from the movement, just the burdens of running the conference.
"I'll be raising hell without having to raise the budget," he said.
The annual budget of $2.5 million supports a staff of about 35 people and 300 chapters and affiliates. In recent years, the organization has been active in bringing attention to the burning of black churches in the South, to negotiating minority business development covenants with Shoney's and the Publix supermarket chain and to starting a gun buy-back program.
Mr. Lowery urged members to "move from the back court of too little action to the front court of a new era of activism."
And he did not let Mr. Clinton's praise prevent him from taking a swipe at the President. After praising Mr. Clinton's eloquence on racial issues -- "the boy can tell a story," Mr. Lowery said -- he chastised the President for a lack of follow-up.
"He quits right after the opening hymn," Mr. Lowery said, "and never makes it to the benediction."

Optimism on Report Today Lifts Bonds

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury prices surged yesterday, bolstered by optimism that today's Employment Cost Index report would show that labor costs remained subdued.
"There's some anticipation that the number tomorrow will be a good one" for bonds, said William Gross, who oversees $90 billion of bonds at the Pacific Investment Management Company in Newport Beach, Calif. 
 The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 21/32, to 102 31/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.40 percent, from 6.45 percent on Friday.
Bond prices were also supported yesterday by a stronger dollar, which makes bonds more attractive to foreign investors.
And bonds received a further boost late in the day after the Treasury estimated that it would borrow $10 billion in the financial markets during the current quarter, less than previously estimated, because of strong tax receipts. It also said it retired a record $71.5 billion of debt in the second quarter.
The moves might make existing bonds more valuable, by shrinking the pool of available debt, traders said.
The Treasury announcement was a prelude to tomorrow's quarterly financing news conference, at which Treasury officials will disclose their plans for next week's sale of 3-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. Those securities will make up a major portion of Treasury borrowing for the quarter.
At yesterday's regular weekly auction of new three-month and six-month bills, the Treasury sold $11.59 billion in three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.12 percent, up from 5.11 percent last week. The Treasury also sold $12.14 billion in six-month bills at an average rate of 5.15 percent, down from 5.17 percent.
Today's Employment Cost Index report kicks off a busy week for economic releases. It will be followed by second-quarter gross domestic product on Thursday and the July jobs report Friday, as well as reports on manufacturing, housing and consumer confidence.
Economists forecast a rise of eight-tenths of 1 percent in the Employment Cost Index, compared with an increase of six-tenths of 1 percent in the previous quarter.
Bonds rallied the last time the report was released, on April 29, when it showed labor costs rose less than expected in the first quarter. Rising wages are viewed as a precursor of inflation, which eats away at bonds' fixed payments.
Much of the optimism among bond investors comes from the upbeat appraisal of the economy from Alan Greenspand, the Federal Reserve chairman, during two days of testimony to Congress last week. He called the economy's mix of strong growth and low inflation "exceptional."
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of three-month and six-month bills:
