HEADLINE: Singular Focus on the Economy Leads to One-Note Campaigns

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: As the nation's economy settles into a slump, the campaign speeches have, too. 

 BODY:
NEWS FLASH! Mitt Romney thinks President Obama has failed to deliver the economic recovery Americans deserve.
EXCLUSIVE! Mr. Obama thinks Mr. Romney would take the country back to policies that will hurt the middle class.
In speech after speech, the two presidential candidates are making the same points again and again. Sometimes there are new rhetorical flourishes or a slightly adjusted approach. But as they crisscross the country, little changes.
And with months of campaigning left, there's no reason to think anything will.
The singular focus on the economic woes of the country has produced a kind of one-note campaign on both sides. And with the nation's economy having settled into a slump, the campaign speeches have, too.
Both candidates traveled to Ohio on Thursday to deliver what their campaigns signaled would be important messages. The president's team, in particular, described the speech as a major effort to frame his economic argument as the campaign heads into the middle of the summer.
But in almost an hour, Mr. Obama offered no new proposals that might change the dynamic of the campaign. Nor did he explain his existing proposals in a dramatically new or different way from his previous approach. 
"What is holding us back is a stalemate in Washington between two fundamentally different views between what direction America should take," Mr. Obama said. "And this election is your chance to break that stalemate."
That message - that the election is a choice between competing visions - has been his mantra for months, if not longer. A month earlier, at the official kickoff of his re-election campaign in Columbus, Ohio, Mr. Obama made essentially the same point, with essentially the same language.
"We are making progress and now we face a choice," the president said then at Ohio State University. "This is a make or break moment for the middle class, and we can't turn back now."
Like Mr. Obama, Mr. Romney this week rehashed his standard campaign themes. Speaking in Cincinnati, Mr. Romney said the president "hasn't delivered a recovery for the economy." 
Compare that to Mr. Romney's announcement speech a year ago in New Hampshire, when he said that when Mr. Obama took office, "the economy was in recession. He made it worse. And he made it last longer."
Repetition in presidential politics is not new. The first Friday of every month, for example, we go through a "didn't we just do that" moment when the Labor Department's latest payroll numbers are released. Campaign operatives know that repeating a message over and over can help drive it into the minds of voters who have plenty of reasons to be distracted.
And many voters are hearing the arguments for the first time as they begin to tune in to the political battle for control of the White House.
But even in that context, Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama seem to have settled quickly on their messages, and they are sticking to them no matter what.
Events could change that, of course. A dramatic improvement in the economy in the next several months could force Mr. Romney to alter his strategy (as he seemed poised to do during several months of economic improvement at the beginning of the year).
Events overseas could yet hijack the presidential conversation. The emerging civil war in Syria and the dramatic dissolution of the Egyptian Parliament are reminders that presidents have to worry about issues beyond the domestic economy. 
And there's still the possibility that one of the candidates concludes that his approach to the economy is not working, and makes an abrupt - and newsworthy - shift in message. 
At the moment, Mr. Obama seems the most likely candidate for a shift if his advisers conclude they need a new way of dealing with the anemic economic recovery.
But for now, voters (and reporters) seem destined to hear the same messages from the candidates over and over again for the next five months.

HEADLINE: Immigration Announcement May Overshadow Romney Bus Tour

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON and MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: As he begins his bus tour Friday, Mr. Romney, who has lain low and focused much of his time on fund-raising since winning the Republican nomination, now will likely be forced to wade into an issue that he had steered clear of for most of the campaign. 

 BODY:
BOSTON - Mitt Romney begins a five-day bus tour on Friday, during which he had hoped to make his case to small-town voters that President Obama's economic policies are failing everyday Americans. But the Romney campaign may find it more difficult to stay on message in the wake of the Obama administration's announcement that it would stop deporting younger immigrants who came to the United States as children.
Mr. Romney, who has lain low and focused much of his time on fund-raising since winning the Republican nomination, now will likely be forced to wade into an issue that he has steered clear of for most of the general election campaign after a nominating fight in which he took positions that alarmed some immigrant rights groups. A Romney spokesman said on Friday that the campaign would be issuing a statement on the policy change.
Four buses will carry Mr. Romney, his aides and the press to rural New Hampshire on Friday, with later stops in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan.
"All six of those states were won by President Obama in 2008, " said Russ Schriefer, a senior strategist, during a rare on-the-record briefing at Mr. Romney's headquarters here. "So we're certainly campaigning on their turf, as opposed to what would be considered our turf."
The Romney campaign is entering a new phase in the general election. Its fast-growing staff, which already fills a few floors of a former furniture warehouse in Boston's north end, just spilled over into a new building nearby. Now it is trying to expand its voter base, as well.
The bus tour is a departure from Mr. Romney's recent approach to campaigning in two key ways. While the Republican nominee has recently focused on highlighting the woes of small businesses in and around big cities, his outreach this time to small-town America is deliberate and conspicuous. Among these "smaller towns off the beaten path," as Mr. Schriefer put it, are Troy, Ohio, Quakertown, Pa., and DeWitt, Mich. His first stop - the 300-acre Scamman farm in Stratham, N.H. - is where he officially began his campaign a year ago.
"Lot of ice cream, lot of cheeseburgers, lot of classic retail," said Rick Gorka, Mr. Romney's traveling spokesman. (Incidentally, one of those cheeseburgers will be with Representative John A. Boehner in the House speaker's home state of Ohio.)
Also, as the Romney campaign has sought to capitalize on President Obama's recent gaffes, the Republican is opening himself up to the types of moments that have led him to stray from his intended message in the past.
Rather than relying on rallies of handpicked party loyalists, "we're expecting people who are not traditional Republicans to come out and listen," Mr. Schriefer said. That effort to reach a broader audience includes a Father's Day interview on CBS's "Face the Nation," Mr. Romney's first Sunday interview of the 2012 cycle not on "Fox News Sunday."
Mr. Romney's rapport with his big-name surrogates will be scrutinized just as much as his interactions with everyday voters. His list of guests include those who appear to have received callbacks in the vice-presidential audition process, including Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire and former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota in New Hampshire on Friday.

HEADLINE: Obama's Decision on Immigration Is Met With Joy, Anger and Skepticism

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: While supporters cheer the Obama administration's new immigration policy, opponents say the president is improperly bypassing Congress and playing election year politics. 

 BODY:
Updated, 6:10 p.m. As my colleagues Julia Preston and John H. Cushman Jr. report, an Obama administration policy announced Friday morning will halt the deportation of illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children and allow them to obtain work permits. 
In remarks about the new policy, President Obama said it would help hundreds of thousands of young people, but he acknowledged that it was not "a permanent fix." 
The policy is similar to the so-called Dream Act, an immigration measure that was designed to offer a path toward citizenship for certain young illegal immigrants but was blocked by Congress in 2010. 
The reaction to the announcement was mixed, with young immigrants hailing the decision, Democratic political leaders heaping praise on the president, and opponents and some Republicans harshly criticizing him for bypassing Congress.
Then, of course, many people on both sides of the debate noted the timing of the announcement, coming just months before the November election as both Mr. Obama and Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, are vying for the Latino vote. 
Speaking after a campaign event in Milford, N.H., Mr. Romney criticized the policy change, saying it would make it more difficult "to reach a long-term solution" for dealing with the fate of young people who are in the United States "through no fault of their own."
He said that he would like to see legislation that deals with this issue. As president, Mr. Romney said he would provide a "long-term solution that provides certainty and clarity."
Shortly after The Associated Press broke the news this morning, lawmakers, advocates and ordinary people turned to Twitter to voice their reaction.

- NYC Mayor's Office (@NYCMayorsOffice)15 Jun 12
With its action today, the Obama administration is making a significant portion of the Dream Act a reality. Ending deportations of innocent young people who have the potential to drive tomorrow's economy is long overdue, as are many common-sense reforms needed to center our immigration policy around our economic needs. We have a system that is choking our economic growth by chasing away the entrepreneurs who can create jobs and the talented people businesses need to succeed and grow. Smart immigration policy protects our borders while ensuring America remains the destination for all those willing to work hard and dream big.
Moving major issues requires action, not rhetoric, and today, the administration took a step toward breaking the Washington logjam on immigration that has hamstrung our economy and made America less competitive in the global marketplace.
Jose Antonio Vargas, the award-winning reporter who revealed in The New York Times last year that he had hidden his status as an illegal immigrant and who wrote the cover story this week in Time magazine, titled "Not Legal, Not Leaving," praised the policy change. Since he left The Washington Post last year, Mr. Vargas created an advocacy organization called Define American.
America embraces 1 million dreams: @defineamerican http://t.co/KAboNsBC #WeAreAmericans #immigration #DREAMAct @TIME
- Jose Antonio Vargas (@joseiswriting)15 Jun 12
He also noted that he would not be covered under the policy.
This won't apply to me--I'm past the age limit of 30 and under. I'm 31. But this is HUGE HUGE HUGE. #sohappy #WeAreAmericans @Time
- Jose Antonio Vargas (@joseiswriting)15 Jun 12
The policy, which is effective immediately, will apply to people who are under 30 years old, arrived in the country before turning 16 and have lived in the United States for five years. They must also have no criminal record, have earned a high school diploma and remained in school or served in the military.
In Congress, the measure received mixed reaction, with Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and the former House speaker, using the announcement to remind voters that the Democrat-led House approved the Dream Act in 2010 before it failed in the Senate.
Strongly support President's decision to stop deporting DREAM Act kids. Democratic-led House passed DREAM in 2010. GOP still obstructing.
- Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi)15 Jun 12
Particular attention was being paid to the response from Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, who has spoken out on immigration issues and is close to the Romney campaign. 
He said in a statement that he was concerned Mr. Obama's approach was a short-term answer to a "long-term problem" that might make it difficult to find a permanent solution. His response was echoed by Mr. Romney later in the day.
There is broad support for the idea that we should figure out a way to help kids who are undocumented through no fault of their own, but there is also broad consensus that it should be done in a way that does not encourage illegal immigration in the future. This is a difficult balance to strike, one that this new policy, imposed by executive order, will make harder to achieve in the long run.
Today's announcement will be welcome news for many of these kids desperate for an answer, but it is a short-term answer to a long-term problem. And by once again ignoring the Constitution and going around Congress, this short-term policy will make it harder to find a balanced and responsible long-term one.
Proud to stand with @BarackObama's landmark decision to protect young #DREAMers & make us achieve a more perfect union. #DREAMact
- Rep. Mike Honda (@RepMikeHonda)15 Jun 12
Today's announcement will give tens of thousands of #DREAMers the chance to come out of the shadows #DREAMAct
- Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin)15 Jun 12
On his Facebook page, Representative Allen West, Republican of Florida, harshly criticized the decision, saying the president had overreached. 
This is yet another example of executive branch overreach. We have a legislative process that ensures representative governance by the consent of the American people. This action should be crafted into legislation, debated in committee and brought before the House and Senate for vote, with accordance of our Constitutional Republic way. Secretary Napolitano is an unelected administrative bureaucrat who does not have the right to make governing decisions for this country. 
It is apparent that the goal of the Obama administration is not to govern, but rule by edict. This again is a reflection of the desperation of President Obama and his liberal progressive disciples as November draws nearer. I find it ironic that Secretary Napolitano would not assist our State of Florida with ensuring the integrity of the voting process but she can make a unilateral decision about who can reside in America. 
Furthermore, where are the details about how the American economy is going to handle this influx of people, who will without a doubt now be guaranteed services and be competing with Americans for jobs? These are the kind of details that are to be hammered out during the legislative process, and appear to be completely overlooked by this Administration as usual.
Mr. West's remarks prompted a flurry of comments, in agreement with his statement. Some expressed concern that allowing work permits for young people who arrived in this country illegally would take away jobs from veterans and returning members of the Armed Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
"Tell me they're not taking work away from our returning troops?" one commenter posted. "What is he thinking.....votes? 800,000 work permits and our unemployment will increase."
Across the country, the decision was met with rallies by supporters and skepticism by others, including elected officials. 
In Arizona, Gov. Jan Brewer, who was criticized for her support of a law allowing police officers to detain people they suspect of being in the country illegally, characterized Mr. Obama's announcement as "blatant political pandering by a president desperate to shore up his political base."
Ms. Brewer went on, "It's no coincidence that this sweeping policy change was announced less than five months before a presidential election." She also described the announcement as a "pre-emptive strike against the U.S. Supreme Court and its decision on S.B.1070," the immigration law whose constitutionality the Obama administration challenged all the way to the nation's highest court.
"He says it's temporary, but we all know better," Ms. Brewer said, then added moments later, "We need to keep our focus upon securing the border."
In Washington, a crowd gathered outside the White House as Mr. Obama made his remarks.
So many students here at #DREAMers rally @whitehouse talking about their futures! #lgbt #P2 http://t.co/LuXkVVOd
- Rea Carey (@rea_carey)15 Jun 12
In Los Angeles, a group of young people had organized a rally Friday morning calling for changes to the immigration law. The rally soon became a celebration when word spread about the news, announced Friday by Janet Napolitano, the Homeland Security secretary.
By afternoon, some of Mr. Obama's supporters in Chicago and across the country were suggesting that people affected by the ruling should volunteer for his re-election effort.
ok #DREAMers time for you to start registering people to vote & campaigning for Obama!
- Monica (@Avenew)15 Jun 12
And advocates for changes in immigration law reminded supporters that the job is not over.
We are very happy but we are still fighting #WeAreAmericans

Today the students are being protected, but we have to fix the system for their families & for the country once and for all. #DREAMers #p2

HEADLINE: Guest Column: Yes, Oil Prices Are Cyclical

BYLINE: AMY MYERS JAFFE


HIGHLIGHT: With the shale oil boom promising over one million barrels a day of new oil production within a year in the United States, analysts are coming out of the woodwork to embrace falling oil prices. But all this is part of a normal cycle. 

 BODY:
The latest round of briefing papers on oil published over the last week on Wall Street is a testament to how quickly things can change when it comes to oil prices. Less than a few months after Brent crude prices topped $125 a barrel, Wall Street is suddenly predicting a possible collapse in oil prices to $50 a barrel. 
The forecasts, which may or may not prove to be correct, reflect more than just a cloudy economic outlook for Europe. There appears to be a definitive shift brewing in long-range perceptions about future oil supplies. 
With the shale oil boom promising over one million barrels a day of new oil production within a year in the United States, analysts are coming out of the woodwork to embrace falling oil prices. The new word on the street when it comes to oil is "sell." Already, the long oil price, that is, futures prices going out past a year, has fallen to $85 a barrel, down from over $100 a barrel earlier this year. 
Citigroup Global Markets took the lead last week with predictions of a cyclical shift that could cause prices to slide in the long term to as low as $50 a barrel. In their latest publication, "Zeroing In On the Long-Term Oil Prices,"Citi analysts state: "Signs are abounding that the escalation in upstream capital spending is bearing fruit, with a surge in discoveries and reserve bookings that is already being converted into new production, particularly in North America. 
"There are no reasons to believe the supply boom in Canada and the United States is about to end," they write. "To the contrary, it appears likely to start spreading across the world."

Citigroup points to a new peak in upstream capital expenditures and the likelihood of a further cost deflation in shale oil economics as potential indicators of a cyclical downturn. "Current shale oil economics are in the $50-to-$80-a-barrel range," the analysts write. "But as technology continues to mature, there is the likelihood of further cost deflation." 
This week Credit Suisse is singing a similar song. "Critically different in the narrative around the current oil market view is a simply bearish view of global economic growth that combines with a positively sanguine view of supply," its analysts write. In the latest issue of its Oil Sense report, Credit Suisse also suggests a severe credit crunch from Europe, against the backdrop of cheaper shale oil prices, could deflate oil prices to $50 a barrel.
Oswald Clint of Sanford Bernstein is hailing Russia's Bazhenov shale as a formation that will dwarf North Dakota's, and bloggers are noting that the state of California has enormous shale oil reserves of 24 billion barrels. Barclay's is more sanguine, expecting stabilization at recent lows below $100 for Brent crude but issuing a similar warning to those who might want to bet that oil prices are about to go back up. 
In the short term, oil prices may or may not gyrate in coming weeks in response to events in the Middle East. But the change from Wall Street's previous obsession with rising oil prices prompts me to say "I told you so" to friends and confidants from the Middle East who thought prices were bound to stay structurally high based on the expectation that the end of "easy oil" would force investors to shift to more costly oil plays. 
As in past decades, technology is increasingly upending fears of impending oil scarcity, causing the costs of unconventional oil and gas development to fall dramatically. Indeed, the technology costs of converting one form of hydrocarbon to another and the costs of providing alternative automotive engine technologies are also likely to fall. So I feel at peace with my original contention that, in the long run, oil prices are cyclical, and that high prices invite the creation of new technologies, ensuring that the upswing of the cycle is eventually followed by the downward slope.
That is the lesson of $147 oil. It propelled shale oil technology and drilling more rapidly than anyone expected. And if you top off shale oil technology with the arrival of more fuel-efficient car technology, ditto on the possibility that oil prices will moderate over time. Experienced futures brokers like Andrew Lebow of Jeffries Bach agree: Shale is already taking the wind out of the sails of long-term oil futures prices. 
My point, however, is not that we can all breathe a sigh of relief. Wall Street oil price predictions can be notoriously inaccurate. And some analysts are arguing that shale's potential is being overblown. 
Still, that the herd can change its mind is a signal that the feeding frenzy in oil is losing force. There is definitely going to be more oil from shale, and our cars are going to need less of the stuff. Does that mean a major disruption of Middle East oil couldn't push us back to $147 oil? No. But it might mean that a major disruption of Middle East oil might be less punishing down the road.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $70 Million

BYLINE: MARC SANTORA


HIGHLIGHT: A 10,882-square-foot condo overlooking the park with the second-highest sale price ever for a New York City apartment. 

 BODY:
A 14-room duplex penthouse apartment above the Ritz-Carlton that sold for $70 million to the casino magnate Steve Wynn was the biggest sale of the week, according to city records. It was also the second-highest price ever paid for an apartment in New York City. 
Having made his fortune in the gambling business, Mr. Wynn must see luxury real estate in Manhattan as a good bet.
Even by the gold-plated standards of recent deals that have nudged the $100 million mark, particularly for apartments surrounding Central Park, Mr. Wynn's new home at 50 Central Park South offers spectacular opulence and space.
On the 30th and 31st floors, the 10,882-square-foot apartment has 26 windows fronting Central Park as well as some 800 square feet of terrace space.
The upper floor has 15-foot-high ceilings and a 900-square-foot living room. The library, a media room, the dining room and the kitchen, which has seven windows, are also on that floor. On the lower floor there are four bedrooms, including a 3,000-square-foot master suite. 
The apartment was sold by Christopher M. Jeffries, a founder of Millennium Partners, which developed the property in its current configuration in 2002. It transformed the 35-story St. Moritz hotel into a Ritz-Carlton hotel on the lower 22 floors and put 12 condominiums on the top floors. Mr. Jeffries bought the duplex penthouse at the time for $22 million.
He was represented by Kyle W. Blackmon of Brown Harris Stevens, and Mr. Wynn by Serena Boardman of Sotheby's International Realty.
Mr. Wynn bought the apartment anonymously through a limited-liability company, but people familiar with the transaction confirmed that he was the buyer.
In any case, he has not been shy about mentioning his new New York home. At a party earlier this week, he told a reporter from the Web site Capital New York that he was eager to settle into it.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Casts New Soot Standard as Easily Met

BYLINE: LESLIE KAUFMAN


HIGHLIGHT: By 2020, the agency estimates, only six counties in the nation are expected to be out of compliance. 

 BODY:
As anticipated, the Environmental Protection Agency announced on Friday that it is proposing to update and tighten national air quality standards for fine-particle soot.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, the agency said that by the time these new standards are fully in force in 2020, all but six counties in the United States will be in compliance with them as a result of steps taken to abide by other tightened rules. 
The E.P.A. also predicted that the costs of compliance would be relatively modest. Depending on the final standard adopted, it said, the costs of compliance could be as low as $2.9 million, with an anticipated $88 million a year in benefits, or range as high as $69 million, an investment that would yield $5.9 billion in benefits. The cost-benefit analysis shows that investing in pollution control yields returns, the agency said. 
Soot, or the microscopic particulates emitted by car tailpipes, diesel engines and industry smokestacks, among other sources, has been found to cause thousands of deaths from lung and heart disease.
Considering the hostile stance of many Congressional Republicans on the issue of environmental regulation, and the fact that President Obama is running for re-election this year, it is not surprising that the E.P.A. would emphasize the potential economic benefits in its announcement. Still, its analysis seemed somewhat perplexing; the agency's current count indicates that 162 counties and 17 partial counties exceed the maximum fine-particulate levels that are being proposed.

The current standard of 15 micrograms of fine particulates per cubic meter of air has been in place since 1997, and today's proposed rules would lower it to 12 to 13.
But Gina McCarthy, an assistant administrator for the E.P.A. who oversees its Office of Air and Radiation, explained in a telephone news conference that counties are already moving in the right direction. Some of the rules that the agency has put into place recently will significantly reduce fine-particulate pollution in any case, she said. 
Some rules that Ms. McCarthy cited that are already making a difference pinpoint emissions from railroads, automobiles, marine vessels and diesel engines at construction sites. The technology needed to meet the new standard is already "available and cost-effective," she said. "We are already getting these reductions, and we are doing it well." 
William Becker, the executive director of the National Association of Clean Air Agencies, a nonpartisan association of state and local air pollution agencies praised the new standards, saying they were based on "good science." 
He said he considered the E.P.A. analysis to be "sort of true" but that several variables needed to be sorted out before it could be verified. For example, could Congressional Republicans roll back a recently approved rule on limiting mercury emissions from power plants that is considered crucial to reducing air pollution? The coal industry is fighting the mercury regulations in court as well.
"It is too early to declare victory," Mr. Becker said.
Ms. McCarthy took pains to emphasize that the six counties singled out by the E.P.A. as potentially being out of compliance in 2020 had unique problems like high concentrations of wood-burning stoves, and that the agency would be working with them. Those counties are Riverside and San Bernadino counties in California; Santa Cruz County, Ariz.; Wayne County, Mich.; Jefferson County, Ala.; and Lincoln County, Mont.

HEADLINE: Presidential Geography: New Mexico

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: After a Democratic sweep in the last election, the state is likely to be more competitive, but still favor President Obama in 2012. 

 BODY:
The 2000 presidential election is most remembered for the Florida recount and George W. Bush's hair-thin margin over Al Gore in the state. But it was actually New Mexico that had the closest contest that year: a 366-vote Gore victory. Four years later, the race in New Mexico was nearly as tight. Mr. Bush managed a 5,988-vote cushion over Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.
Then came the 2008 race, and the vote in New Mexico wasn't close to close. President Obama carried the state by 125,590 votes, a 15-percentage point shellacking.
So what happened?
Answer 1: Demographic changes, a growing Hispanic population chief among them, finally hit a tipping point, and Democratic presidential candidates will be able to bank on New Mexico's five electoral votes in 2012 and for the foreseeable future.
Answer 2: The 2008 election was an anomaly. A Democratic wave nationally -- caused by a deeply unpopular Republican in the White House and a financial crisis -- as well as a strong get-out-the-vote effort by the Obama campaign combined to inflate the margin in New Mexico. The state will revert to its pre-2008 competitiveness in 2012.
To find the correct answer, FiveThirtyEight spoke with two political science professors from the University of New Mexico: Gabriel R. Sanchez, who is also the director of research for Latino Decisions; and Christine Sierra, who heads up the university's Southwest Hispanic Research Institute.
New Mexico has grown more Democratic as its Hispanic population has increased. Hispanics make up 46 percent of the state's population. Mr. Bush was competitive there partly because he did well among Hispanic voters, winning 44 percent in 2004. In 2008, by contrast, Senator John McCain of Arizona won just 30 percent of the Hispanic vote.
Spanish-speaking enclaves in northern New Mexico trace their heritage back to the Spanish explorers of the 1500s, and many families have been American citizens for generations. As a result, Hispanic turnout tends to be higher in the north than in southwest New Mexico, where recent immigrants from Mexico and Central and South America are more common.
Beyond the growing Latino population, Mr. Obama's margin in New Mexico was helped by the state's large American Indian presence, which is 10 percent of New Mexico's population and which was determinedly courted by the Obama campaign in 2008.
The Third Congressional District is the most Democratic in the state. It includes liberal-leaning Sante Fe and has a higher share of Indians, almost 20 percent, than the state's other two districts. 
New Mexico might be even more Democratic if not for idiosyncratic Albuquerque, the state's only real metropolis. Albuquerque, in the central part of the state, is less Democratic than big cities in other states. The First Congressional District, which is anchored by Albuquerque, elected a Republican to Congress from its creation in 1969 until 2008. 
One reason Albuquerque might be more politically competitive than other big cities, Ms. Sierra said, is that nearly one-fourth of its workers are employed by the government, and many of those jobs are defense-related. Sandia National Laboratories and Kirtland Air Force Base are both in Albuquerque.
The southeast is the one overwhelmingly Republican region of New Mexico. Known as Little Texas, the area -- in its culture and landscape -- resembles its giant neighbor: it is predominately white, and oil and cattle ranching are two of its principal industries. 
The Bellwether: Sandoval County
Sandoval County has recently been an almost-perfect barometer of New Mexico's political mood. In the past three presidential elections, the vote share for both the Democrat and the Republican in Sandoval County hasn't been more than one percentage point off of the levels statewide.
Sandoval County is home to Rio Rancho, a suburb of Albuquerque that has ballooned into the third largest city in the state. Rio Rancho grew 69 percent from 2000 to 2010. The residents of its subdivisions, like the one above, are a little more conservative than the people of Albuquerque and include employees for Intel, Victoria's Secret and Sprint PCS, all of which have plants in Rio Rancho.
The Bottom Line
Mr. Obama is a 92 percent favorite in New Mexico, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. The model projects the president will receive 55 percent to Mr. Romney's 44 percent, an 11-point margin. That would be a closer race -- if not exactly close -- compared to 2008.
An 11-point Democratic margin is also probably closer to New Mexico's default partisan lean than the 15-point victory in 2008. Going back to our two answers at the top of this post, both Mr. Sanchez and Ms. Sierra said that both were incorrect. "The truth likely lies somewhere between the two, but it is too early to tell," Mr. Sanchez said.
New Mexico might be a swing state in future elections, depending on the national political environment and the candidates. In particular, a Republican candidate would have to have unique appeal to Hispanics to put the state in play (a task that may have been made harder for Mr. Romney by the Obama administration's decision to limit deportations in certain cases).
But New Mexico is probably no longer a tipping-point state. And if Mr. Obama finds himself in danger of losing in the Land of Enchantment, it's likely that a large share of the rest of the nation has already become disenchanted with him.

HEADLINE: In Investments, As in Life, Passion Can Cloud Judgment

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
I'VE been talking to a lot of wealthy people in the last few weeks who have followed their passions into a variety of investments: vineyards, baseball teams, restaurants and racehorses. But I couldn't help wondering what it would take for these people, who had made the money for such investments by being shrewd in other lines of work, to sell their stake in a fascinating second career.
A study released this week on how investors feel about their ''treasure'' confirmed what I had suspected: if you think people make bad decisions when it comes to investing in securities, they make worse ones when it comes to something tangible.
The report, ''Profit or Pleasure? Exploring the Motivations Behind Treasure Trends'' from Barclays Wealth and Investment Management, focused more on collectibles like the classic cars I wrote about last week. But the same biases apply to the passion investments I wrote about. 
People become emotionally attached to these investments in a way they never would to a stock, and this leads them to make what the report artfully terms ''suboptimal decisions about when to buy, sell, or how much to pay.''
Investing in a passion at the right price is not easy. The Barclays report discusses how news of a high price for, or a great return on, a passion investment will skew other people's views of that investment's chances of increasing in value. A recent example is the sale of a version of Munch's ''The Scream'' painting for nearly $120 million.
''In an art auction, if you're the one who won, you're the one who valued it more than everyone else in the world,'' said Daniel P. Egan, behavioral finance specialist for the Americas at Barclays. ''How long will it take to find someone who is as wealthy as you and will overvalue it as much as you?''
This is what behavioral economists call the winner's curse. And it is certainly not limited to individuals. Critics have questioned the $2.15 billion the group led by Guggenheim Partners paid this year for the Los Angeles Dodgers -- a price that was probably $500 million higher than the next-closest bidder.
Still, individual investors have the advantage of time. And they are using their own money.
Bill Campbell, a former chairman of Visa International, told me that he and his business partner had spent $17 million buying and renovating a 150-year-old house in Bridgehampton, N.Y., that will open later this summer as an inn and restaurant called Topping Rose House.
''It's one of those things where there are elements of pride, subjectivity, history, all of those things,'' Mr. Campbell said. ''But the basic investment analysis holds up as long as you don't have a short window.''
Mr. Egan said that investors would be better off if they started thinking of the spending on their passion as separate from their traditional investments and more like a weekend home.
''You have to ask yourself, like every other durable consumption asset, is the cost of maintaining the second house at the shore worth the enjoyment you get from it?'' Mr. Egan said.
The people I spoke to who have been exceedingly successful with passion investments, like George Bolton with racehorses, have the ability to tamp down some of the passion. Mr. Bolton regularly sells horses that do not look promising but he also sells ones that have won, as he did with his stake in Curlin shortly after he won the Preakness Stakes in 2007.
''We're constantly keeping the inventory at 10 mares and the racing population at 10 to 15 horses,'' Mr. Bolton, an investment adviser, said. ''To make money, you have to sell good horses, get rid of bad horses, and race horses. You've got to constantly keep the inventory in motion.''
Yet, in passion investments, Mr. Bolton is unusual. According to the Barclays report, the amount of profit an owner sought when trying to sell escalated with age. People in their 30s required 56 percent more to sell a prized asset, whereas people in their 70s wanted 62 percent more -- and that was in the first year after they acquired it.
Just as interesting is how people define a fair price for a passion investment. Most people have a number in their head that represents the most they will pay for something, Mr. Egan said.
''You pay $1 million for a painting by a new artist, and you say that is the maximum amount you're willing to pay for it,'' Mr. Egan said. ''Subsequently, you find out it will cost you another $5,000 a year to maintain it. Odds are you won't say, 'I didn't reckon on that extra cost each year,' and sell it.''
Then again, when you are investing for the long term, short-term expenses may matter less. Tom Seidler, who owns the Visalia Rawhide minor league baseball team, said it was difficult to make money year to year but increasing the team's long-term value was a different matter. Charlie Blaney, president of the California League, said the value of Class A teams like the Rawhide was appreciating at 16 to 20 percent a year.
In several cases, the people I talked to said that they did not plan on selling these investments, no matter what. Ralph Marano, a car dealer from Westfield, N.J., who owns 85 classic cars, said, ''I'll leave them for my two sons to figure out.''
This is not uncommon. John D. Dadakis, a lawyer in the wealth planning practice at Holland & Knight, said collectors and other passion investors typically made two mistakes when it came to estate planning. They do not tell their adviser the extent of the collection, which throws off calculations, and they cannot conceive that their heirs will not want to take over what they have collected or invested in when they're gone.
''At that point, it no longer is a passion hobby,'' Mr. Dadakis said. ''It's an economic difficulty or a next-generation fight over who has more passion for it.''
I thought of the vineyard owners when he mentioned this. Many of these businessmen-turned-vintners had visions of their vineyards becoming a business for their children to run. While I would love to inherit a vineyard, I'm not sure everyone feels the same way.
Bill Foley, the chairman of Fidelity National Financial, has been on a vineyard acquisition spree for the last five years, with 12 wineries purchased and plans to buy five more.
''Three of my four kids are going to get into this business,'' he said of Foley Family Wines. ''This is going to be in my family forever. I don't want to sell assets. I want to keep accumulating assets and putting them in the wine business.''
According to the Barclays study, inheritors often have an easier time than their parents in selling off the passion investments. (It turns out, Mr. Egan said, that if the second generation doesn't sell it off, the chances of it staying in the family for many generations goes up.)
One of the people whose thinking about passion investments really impressed me was David Barr, who owns 25 Kentucky Fried Chicken and Taco Bell franchises but leaves the day-to-day operations to a partner.
''I have no desire for my kids to feel an obligation to come into this business,'' Mr. Barr said. ''I've always said that even if they want to come in, they need to bring their own unique talent. If they came to me at 30 and said 'I've had these experiences and I have these skills,' I'd look at that as I would any investment.''
Mr. Barr's way of thinking guarantees one thing: his children will have to find their own passion.

HEADLINE: Tales of Student Loan Struggles

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Students, college graduates and their families have shared their personal struggles with education debt with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
The bureau solicited the comments because it is studying whether there should be more regulation of so-called ''private'' student loans, those made by lenders outside the federal student loan programs. Private student loans are often more expensive than federal loans, and lack some of the borrower protections that federal loans carry.
This week, the bureau published online nearly 2,000 comments submitted by the general public. Although the bureau redacted names from the personal stories, many provide a compelling portrait of how the burden of educational debt is weighing on many Americans. While the bureau sought information specifically about private loans, some comments indicate that borrowers are often unsure about whether their loans are federal or private. 
In general, the bureau said in a statement announcing publication of the comments, the submissions show that borrowing for college is a difficult, confusing process for many. Some said they turned to private loans because they assumed they were ineligible for federal loans, and many find their debt load unmanageable.
Here are some examples of the comments. Many more are available online.
''My family is having an unexpectedly, extremely difficult time with student loan debt, including $65,000+ in private student loans. Unfortunately, during my 2 children's college years, as a single, working mother, I did the best I could to get them a good education. Not knowing any better, I erroneously co-signed private student loans for them while feeling pressure every semester to meet their tuition and room/board needs. After making that mistake twice for each kid, I then took out Parent Plus loans. My two kids' total loan debt (including federal un and sub, my credit card payments of tuition, my Parent Plus loans, and our private student loans) totals to date is $200,000+ and climbing. My son graduated with a 4-year degree in Dec. 2009 and cannot find a job. He applies for all types of jobs every day online. There is nothing in his field. My daughter graduated in May 2011 with a 4-year degree and is working outside of her field part-time, because she cannot find a job in her field (we live in northeastern PA). She comes home crying every day. The pressures and looming cloud are always there.''
''My private student loans have been in default for the past two years. They are currently listed as ''charge-offs,'' and I lie awake many nights wondering when the lawsuit will arrive at my door. I was on unemployment, and am now receiving a fellowship to pursue my PhD. During this time, I tried, repeatedly to reach an agreement with my lender to lower my payments (which were almost $500 per month). I simply did not have the money, but they refused to give me options, scoffing at my offer to send them a lower amount per month. So I just stopped paying. I know that because of this action I may never be able to buy a house or get a loan, but I felt backed up against a wall. I don't want to skirt my obligations, but I need more reasonable options. Thank you for considering this note.''
''Private student loan originators and servicers make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to pay down the principal on an existing student loan. For those that are successful, it requires a monthly call to the student loan servicer requesting that the extra money be applied to principal instead of future payments. For others, including myself, I have made multiple calls to my loan servicer requesting that the extra money I include each month be applied to principal, and am told each time that the money is applied to (future) principal (payments) and continue to have my payment advanced, despite documentation in my loan disclosures stating that my loan is eligible for prepayment. After countless calls and speaking to many different representatives of my loan servicing company (Chase), I have defeatedly decided to only pay the minimum payment each month until maturity since paying extra is not saving me any money in the long run.''
''I took out both federal and private loans during law school and then graduated in 2008 when the economy was seriously depressed. Now I am struggling to pay my loans working as a contract attorney because I have not been fortunate enough to find a permanent position. I am allowed to defer federal loan payments based on my income, but there is nothing I can do about my private loans. I am hoping I can get the final six-month extension to delay these payments, but there is no guarantee and if I don't receive this final extension, then I will be forced to default on my loan payments. I am horrified by the position I am in. Once a responsible individual who would always pay my credit card in full, I am now struggling to pay the minimum balance and avoiding my student loans completely. In retrospect, law school wasn't worth it. Students should have the same deferment options based on income levels on private loans as they do on federal loans or private lending for student loans should be terminated.''
''My wife and I have over $150,000 in student loans between us, in large part because we have never been able to make regular payments because they would be so large as to prevent us from having a home. So the interest keeps getting added on to the principal. We are in modest-paying teaching jobs. Moreover, our interest rates are locked in at above 7%. These student loans hanging over us for at least 15 years are a major source of stress. Unfortunately, it was the only way we could attend school and improve our prospects when we already had children. We are extremely productive and devoted citizens and I think we deserve a little help. We also purchased our home in '06 when prices were inflated and are thus currently underwater and cannot sell our home even if we wanted to.''
What, if anything, should be done to help families who are struggling with student debt, especially private loans?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Central Banks Stand at Ready To Fortify Euro

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and DAVID JOLLY; Binyamin Appelbaum, Nathaniel Popper and Annie Lowrey contributed reporting.

 BODY:
With an election looming in Greece that could determine the future of the euro, central bankers overseas signaled Friday that they were prepared to take action to shore up nervous financial markets after Sunday's vote.
The head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, hinted that he would be ready to pump cash into banks there to head off turmoil. His counterpart in Tokyo, Masaaki Shirakawa, promised that the Bank of Japan was ready to ''to take all possible measures to ensure the financial system does not come under threat.''
The statements underscored just how anxious policy makers are ahead of the vote, which they fear could result in a victory by left-wing parties that oppose the deep austerity Greece agreed to in exchange for financial help. If the anti-austerity Syriza party wins, it could eventually force an exit by Greece from the euro zone and feed fears of a broader financial crisis. 
Authorities hope that a large infusion of cash into the financial system, if needed next week, could act as a financial firewall to help protect shakier banks in Southern Europe. Depositors have been fleeing not only Greek banks, but Spanish banks as well, raising concerns that these institutions could run short of the funds necessary to conduct normal business. As worries have spread, banks on the Continent have sharply curtailed short-term loans to each other out of concern that they may not be repaid if things start spinning out of control. That fear has further dried up the flow of money in many European economies.
It is unclear whether authorities can pump enough money into the system to stave off troubles if the Greek election results scare investors. But investors welcomed Mr. Draghi's pledge as a sign that after years of half-steps that repeatedly failed to halt the momentum of the crisis in Europe, leaders were finally facing up to the severity of Europe's distress and acting before investors forced their hand.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose more than 1 percent Friday, a sign that investors were confident central bankers and governments would act quickly if need be.
European markets also rallied Friday, with German stocks rising nearly 1.5 percent and French shares up 1.8 percent. But in the past, these kinds of upward moves have quickly faded amid doubts over whether long-term fixes will be found.
''Markets and people need to be reassured we are still traveling together,'' Mr. Draghi told a group of economists in Frankfurt. ''The euro system will continue to supply liquidity to solvent banks where needed.''
The Federal Reserve in Washington has taken a wait-and-see attitude toward the vote, but Obama administration officials have made it plain just how high the stakes are for the United States in Europe's debt crisis. ''Euro-area fragility remains the key risk to our recovery and the global economy,'' Lael Brainard, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, said Friday.
After more than two years of tension, the coming days are seen as a turning point that could determine whether Europe's fiscal ties grow closer or fray. On the heels of the Greek vote, leaders of the Group of 20 nations will gather in Mexico on Monday and Tuesday, with European leaders set to hold a summit meeting of their own later this month.
Any move by the European Central Bank in response to the Greek election would fall short of the kind of structural changes investors want to see Europe make, most notably the ability to issue euro zone bonds to relieve pressure on riskier borrowers like Spain and Italy and a Continentwide guarantee for bank deposits to halt capital flight.
A broader, more concrete blueprint to remake the structure of the euro zone would be made public ''in a matter of days,'' Mr. Draghi said, so that it can be considered by European leaders when they gather in late June.
''We need a credible vision for the long-term stability of the euro zone,'' said Markus Krygier, a money manager in London who is betting on more trouble ahead for the euro. ''If you don't have that, traders will keep coming back and try to test the euro zone.''
In Switzerland and Britain, central bankers had already announced contingency plans ahead of a weekend that recalled the tension that preceded the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.
The Bank of England said Thursday it would offer British banks increased financing for business loans. The head of the Swiss National Bank, Thomas Jordan, promised to buy ''unlimited quantities'' of foreign currency to prevent the Swiss franc from rising further as investors fled the euro.
Ultimately, though, it will be the European Central Bank that is best positioned to keep a local crisis in Greece from broadening into Continentwide or global financial contagion, strategists said.
''The E.C.B. holds the key to this,'' said Hans Mikkelsen, a credit strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ''We can expect the E.C.B. to do what it takes.''
He noted that Mr. Draghi's willingness to act boldly stood in contrast to his predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, who took a more cautious stance when it came to central bank intervention.
Since taking over as president of the European Central Bank in November 2011, Mr. Draghi has twice extended funds to European banks through long-term loans and, Mr. Mikkelsen noted, might do so a third time if necessary after the Greek vote.
The Federal Reserve also has formidable tools at its disposal to contain the fallout from a financial crisis, as it has demonstrated repeatedly in recent years.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has made clear that the Fed will take any actions necessary to ensure that American banks, including the subsidiaries of foreign banks, can borrow enough money to finance their operations.
But so far there is little evidence of financing pressure on this side of the Atlantic. And the Fed is unlikely to take major steps unless events in Europe begin to destabilize the American financial system or to impede the domestic economy.
The Fed does plan to continue offering Europe one narrow but significant kind of support. Since 2007, it has allowed European banks to borrow dollars at low interest rates through an agreement with the European Central Bank.
The program, which ensures that dollars remain in ready supply for a wide range of transactions, was heavily used earlier this year amid concerns that Greece and its creditors would not reach an agreement to restructure the country's debts. But there has been almost no increase in borrowing recently. Even as central bankers reiterated their support on Friday, many investors were holding out hope that the euro-friendly New Democracy party would win enough votes to put together a coalition and take power in Athens. An election in May failed to produce a workable coalition government.
The most recent polls showed New Democracy holding a slight edge, and Citibank economists estimated Friday that the party had an 83 percent chance of forming a new coalition government.
If Friday's optimism in the markets turns out to have been misplaced, however, investors are counting on central bank action.
''I'm sure the E.C.B. will provide whatever liquidity is needed on Monday morning at the drop of a hat,'' said Carl Weinberg, the chief economist at High Frequency Economics.

HEADLINE: Mayors See Slight Gains, No Thanks To Congress

BYLINE: By LIZETTE ALVAREZ

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Three years after their cities were battered by recession, America's mayors are exhaling -- collectively -- and saying the worst may be over.
High underemployment and unemployment still dog most cities. But by and large, mayors, who are gathered here for their annual conference, have seen revenue either rise a bit or stay stable, deficits shrink, property values increase, new jobs crop up and the quality of life improve.
''There is a feeling of cautious optimism,'' said Buddy Dyer, the mayor of Orlando, which is leading Florida in job and transportation growth. ''We are on the road to recovery. It is a long road, not a quick one.'' 
And yet, the mayors -- Democrats and Republicans -- wanted to be clear about one thing: this ever so slight upswing in their cities has zero to do with Congress. They say progress was made despite Washington's profound inaction.
While the mayors struggled to balance their cities' budgets, wrangle with pensions and layoffs, safeguard public safety and scrape for pennies and jobs, Washington has been mired in ideological gridlock over just about everything. And this, they say, comes at a time when the country was in dire need of direction and inspiration.
''The word frustrated is too mild; it's more like disgusted,'' said Antonio R. Villaraigosa, a Democrat and the fiery mayor of Los Angeles who is also the departing president of the United States Conference of Mayors.
Scott Smith, a Republican who is mayor of Mesa, Ariz., which was hit hard by the recession, said the frustration over Washington cuts across party lines. Mayors take pride in their can-do approach to problems, which is not an attribute shared by Washington, he said.
''We see first hand how this hurts our citizens,'' Mr. Smith said. ''That's how you get close to anger. Their indecision and inability to get things done impacts the community. When there is uncertainty, who will invest? Hence the slow recovery.''
Kasim Reed, the mayor of Atlanta, has moved beyond anger. ''Anger requires a belief that your anger will change behavior,'' Mr. Reed said. ''Most mayors are indifferent.''
Convinced that nothing will change anytime soon, they have moved on.
''Mayors have realized we can't wait for Congress,'' said Jim Brainard, a Republican and the mayor of Carmel, Ind., who along with tackling brass tacks economic issues has focused on quality-of-life concerns in his small city outside of Indianapolis, including the arts, bike trails and roundabouts as a lure to residents. ''There are things that need to be done, and can be done now.''
Among the mayors' biggest complaints: the transportation bill, a basic mandate of the federal government. The last time Congress passed a transportation bill was 2005, when George W. Bush was president and America was still glowing economically. It expired in 2009. Since then, Congress has extended it nine times, punting on the harder task of approving a new bill.
Mayors are keen on transportation and infrastructure -- light rail lines, highway interchanges, bridge repairs, airport and port projects -- because they create jobs, satisfy residents and promote investment and growth. The absence of a new federal law means that mayors cannot plan for large projects.
''These decisions are terrible for the country,'' Mr. Reed said. ''It is an absolutely inappropriate way to manage the most important economy in the world. You have no stability.''
Harsh words were also reserved for ''sequestration'' -- the large across-the-board budget cuts that take effect in January if Congress, through a supercommittee, does not agree on how to reduce the deficit over 10 years. Military spending will take a considerable hit.
Greg Stanton, the mayor of Phoenix, which is home to one of the largest aerospace and defense industries in the nation, is girding for the hit if sequestration is not delayed. His state could suffer the loss of 33,000 private sector jobs at a time when the city is lifting out of a free fall, he said.
''We are a few months away from pink slips in these fields,'' said Mr. Stanton, a Democrat. ''They are increasing unemployment at the exact wrong time.''
The mayors at the conference (a majority are Democrats) doled out appreciation, or at least a qualified thanks, for the federal stimulus money that President Obama sent their way. The money was used to keep teachers, police officers and firefighters at work, pave roads and kick start ''green'' initiatives, among other things. Federal grants, although shrinking, have also helped, they said.
In return, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in a late-morning address on Friday, praised the mayors for their diligence and willingness to work with both foes and allies to forge compromises.
''I think you're all crazy,'' Mr. Biden told the crowd jokingly. ''Being a mayor -- that's a real job. And they know where you live.
''You, among any group of elected officials, have seen up close and personal the negative impact of this god-awful recession we inherited,'' he added.
Despite the duress of the past three years, many mayors said the recession carried a silver lining: they were forced to take a hard look at their cities and make decisions about what really mattered. The austerity required them to alter bad habits, strip away waste and think more creatively.
Not long ago, Mesa faced a decision on whether to close the museum and arts center so it could fortify its police and fire departments. Mesa, a conservative stronghold, chose to keep the arts, said the mayor, Mr. Smith, and it was the chief of police who stood up at a hearing to talk about the vital role culture plays in a community.
''Communities have had to look into their souls and say, 'Who are we?' '' Mr. Smith said. ''It's tough when you are forced to make real decisions. It's Solomonesque. And that was healthy for us.''

HEADLINE: Workers Point Finger at Their Own Agency Amid a Backlog in Veterans' Benefits

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO

 BODY:
To hear wounded veterans tell it, there are few things more daunting, infuriating or soul-crushing than dealing with the Veterans Benefits Administration, the agency that decides whether they will receive disability benefits for injuries and illnesses incurred during war.
As the inventory of unprocessed claims has grown -- to more than 900,000 nationwide -- so has anger with the agency. On Tuesday, in what has become an annual ritual, Congress will hold hearings on the V.B.A.'s chronically poor performance. 
But in one small pocket of the sprawling benefits agency, a branch of the Department of Veterans Affairs, front-line workers are taking the unusual step of going public about the dysfunction within their own bureaucracy, making common cause with some of their loudest critics.
On Saturday, workers from the benefits agency's regional office in Columbia, S.C., will picket outside their workplace, hoping to spotlight what they consider root causes of their system's breakdown: lack of accountability, inadequate resources, hopelessly complex policies and demoralizing work conditions.
''We want to take care of veterans; many of us are veterans,'' said Ronald Robinson, a protest leader, president of the union local and an Army veteran. ''We can't sit any longer and be blamed for things that are beyond our control.''
The backlog in the disability compensation system has steadily worsened since the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began, having more than doubled in the last decade. The department defines its backlog as claims that have been awaiting decisions for more than 125 days, the department's benchmark for timeliness.
Almost no regional office has been immune from problems, with the office in Oakland, Calif., now sending new claims to other offices because its inventory has grown so large. Yet even the Columbia office, considered by some veterans advocates to be relatively good, had a backlog of about 15,000 claims last month and did not accurately process one out of three claims last year, according to a report by the department's inspector general.
Leaders of the Department of Veterans Affairs and the protesters in Columbia agree on some of the causes of the backlog: a flood of claims by recent Afghanistan and Iraq war veterans as well as aging Vietnam veterans seeking compensation for old injuries or Agent Orange-related illnesses; a weak economy; and the growing complexity and number of injuries and diseases now recognized as service-related.
But on the issue of how to fix the problem, the two sides sharply diverge. The department says its efforts to digitize records, update computer software, hire 4,000 workers, extend overtime to process claims and make changes intended to speed the processing of claims will begin shrinking inventory by next year.
In a statement, the V.A. said those initiatives had put it on track to process all claims in less than 125 days by 2015. ''Change can be challenging, and we recognize that our dedicated employees are critical to providing veterans with timely, quality benefits,'' the statement said.
In the trenches in Columbia, however, the protest leaders say those efforts had made little difference, and in some cases had made matters worse.
One reason, they said, is that some new procedures have added complexity to an already complex process. For instance, they said, a questionnaire created to allow veterans to use private health providers to do physical examinations is longer and more complicated than the forms used by government providers.
When questionnaires are returned with mistakes or unchecked boxes, reviewers must return them, delaying decisions. ''They've implemented so much stuff, no human can keep up with it all,'' said Cindy Indof, a decision review officer who has been with the department for 20 years.
Workers also said processing a claim had become increasingly segmented, with files passing through several hands before being denied or approved. As a result, files are more likely to be misplaced, communications garbled and decisions slowed, they said. And no one is held accountable for mistakes because so many people are involved.
''No one has ownership over anything,'' said Mr. Robinson, a veterans service representative.
The employees also complained about the performance review process used to measure their productivity, saying it reduced the quality of work and hurt morale. The process requires claims processors to complete a certain number of files per day. People who fall short can be denied promotions or fired. Those who meet or exceed quotas become eligible for bonuses.
The workers said those quotas encourage processors to take shortcuts that often lead to mistakes, or to focus on easier cases over complex ones. And when in doubt, processors tend to deny claims, the workers said, because denials are generally faster.
Though the Columbia protest might seem isolated, James Strickland, a Vietnam-era veteran and retired health care manager who runs a popular Web site, VAWatchdog.org, said he had heard similar complaints from V.A. offices across the country. The Columbia workers are different, however, because they have gone public.
''They aren't looking for more money or vacation,'' said Mr. Strickland, who plans to attend the protest. ''I heard them say, 'I want the system to change so I'm allowed to do my job.' And I hear that all the time.''
Mr. Robinson said about 8,300 cases were ready to be processed in the Columbia office, which has about 100 claims raters, many of whom already have more than 140 cases on their desks.
''Do the math,'' he said. ''There is nothing we can do to catch up.''

HEADLINE: A Slow Recovery in the United States, but It's All Relative

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix

 BODY:
THE slow pace of the American economic recovery seems likely to be a major issue in this year's presidential election. But by the standards of other developed countries, the United States has done rather well since the credit crisis blossomed in 2008 and sent the world into recession. 
The American economy, adjusted for inflation, was 1.2 percent larger in the first quarter of this year than it was in the peak quarter before the recession.
As the accompanying charts show, only Canada among the Group of 7 industrialized economies has done better. It has benefited from being an exporter of natural resources that China needs, but it also escaped the worst of the downturn because its banks, better regulated than those in this country, did not finance a real estate bubble during the boom.
Even Canada, however, had one quarter last year when its economy declined.
The charts show the performance of the Group of 7 nations, including three members of the euro zone, and that of seven other countries that use the euro. Of the 14, the United States is the only one to show consistent growth over the most recent four quarters. It has reported a growing economy for 11 consecutive quarters, even if the pace of growth has not been very fast.
At the bottom of the global recession, the American economy was 5.1 percent smaller than it had been at the peak and the recession ranked as the deepest since World War II. The only other recession since the Great Depression to shave as much as 3 percent from gross domestic product was the one in 1973 to 1975, brought on by the shock of higher oil prices. It took seven quarters for the American economy to regain all its losses during and after that downturn; this time it took twice as long.
When the American economy hit its low, it appeared that the United States ranked in the middle group of industrialized countries in terms of severity of recession. Portugal appeared to have escaped with a maximum decline of just 4.1 percent, and Spain with a loss of slightly less than 5 percent. But in the new downturn, Portugal now has a total decline of 5.2 percent, and Spain, buffeted by the need to bail out its banks, may be headed to a new low. Its economy has declined for two consecutive quarters. Italy, which like Spain is finding lenders hesitant to buy government bonds, has reported G.D.P. declines for the last three quarters.
Portugal, Ireland and Greece are the countries that were bailed out by Europe, but so far not one has shown much sign of recovery. Greece has now endured 13 consecutive quarters of decline, with no end in sight. Ireland for a time appeared to be a relative success story, as its G.D.P. grew at a rate of more than 4 percent in the first half of 2011. But it fell back later in the year.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: When Slow Growth Looks Good: Among the Group of 7 industrialized countries, only the Canadian, United States and German economies are now larger than they were at their prerecession peaks. The top set of charts shows the seven G-7 countries, ranked by performance since each economy peaked in 2007 or 2008, with members of the euro zone in italics. The second set shows the performance of seven other euro zone countries, similarly ranked. (Source: Haver Analytics)

HEADLINE: Indexes Rally on Hopes Banks Will Counter Turmoil

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rallied on Friday for a second straight week on hopes that global central banks will take action if the election in Greece on Sunday sets off market turmoil.
That possibility helped offset the latest round of weak economic data in the United States, which pointed to sluggish growth. But traders were cautious, and United States bond prices rose as a result of the flight to safety.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 16/32, to 101 16/32, and the yield fell to 1.59 percent, from 1.64 percent late Thursday. 
Adding to the support for bonds was disappointing economic data that reinforced the view that growth is slowing for a third consecutive spring as the euro zone debt crisis drags on the global economy.
Materials, energy and financial shares led the market's gains, with each of the three sector indexes in the Standard & Poor's 500 up 1 percent or more.
Gold rose for a sixth straight session as investors bet on additional stimulus by central banks and hedged against economic uncertainty ahead of the Greek election.
Officials of the Group of 20 leading nations said on Thursday that central banks of major economies would take steps to stabilize markets and prevent a credit squeeze, if necessary.
The news spurred sharp gains late in Thursday's session. Later reports that the European Central Bank hinted at an interest-rate cut and Britain's pledge to flood banks with cash prompted further bullishness.
''It pokes a hole in the balloon of bad news after more bad news,'' said Richard I. Sichel, chief investment officer of the Philadelphia Trust Company.
He added: ''None of the economic data we saw today were impressive. The gains seem to be based more on hope and less on the economic reports.''
For the week, the Dow industrials gained 1.7 percent, the S.& P. 500 added 1.3 percent and the Nasdaq rose 0.5 percent.
On Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 115.26 points, or 0.91 percent, to 12,767.17. The S.& P. 500-stock index added 13.74 points, or 1.03 percent, to 1,342.84. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.47 points, or 1.29 percent, to end at 2,872.80.
Spain's banking system weighed on markets and the country's 10-year bond yield, at 6.92 percent, was still too close to the 7 percent mark at which other indebted euro-zone nations were forced to seek bailouts.
Some investors fear the vote in Greece may set the nation on the path to an exit from the euro zone, a possibility that created volatility this week.
A gauge of manufacturing in New York State fell sharply in June, though it still showed growth, while an early June reading on consumer sentiment slipped to a six-month low on worries about the nation's job market and Europe's debt crisis. The consumer sentiment reading was below consensus forecasts.
Recent economic indicators, including an unexpected rise in jobless claims on Thursday, have pointed to sluggish growth in the United States economy. However, United States equities have largely tracked European developments in recent months and have shrugged off weak domestic data on occasion.
The lackluster United States data, alongside the possible turmoil after the Greek elections, could increase the chance that the Federal Reserve will signal more stimulus to counter slowing growth when it releases its policy statement next Wednesday at the close of a two-day meeting.

HEADLINE: Creating Rules for Natural Gas Drilling

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Drilling in New York'' (editorial, June 14) does not mention one important factor: the property rights of New York landowners and lessees.
Limiting drilling for shale gas to a small portion of the state and then allowing localities in effect a ''local option'' as to allowing or forbidding it is inconsistent with assuring each landowner and lessee equal fair treatment.
However much this may be smart politics for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, it brings about an arbitrary and capricious patchwork result in violation of the Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee of ''equal protection.'' 
Reasonable regulation for protection of health is appropriate, but this arbitrary and capricious scheme will not survive judicial scrutiny.
WINTHROP DRAKE THIES New York, June 14, 2012
The writer is a retired lawyer.
To the Editor:
Daniel Yergin hails the resurgence of natural gas and oil production (''America's New Energy Reality,'' Sunday Review, June 10), noting the crucial roles played by fracking of shale gas and extraction of oil found in tight rock formations.
The economic benefits of these developments are profound, he contends, because more dollars are staying at home, boosting American jobs.
As development of shale gas and oil continues to flourish, expect job growth in areas that Mr. Yergin doesn't mention. Demand will surge for hydrologists skilled at cleaning up groundwater contaminated by fracking fluids. The bottled water delivery business will prosper for that same reason. Seismologists will be in demand. The United States Geological Survey recently affirmed that earthquake activity and deep injection of wastewater from fracking operations are linked.
In his essay, Mr. Yergin's first and only reference to the environment appears in the final sentence.
Let's hope environmental protection isn't an afterthought in the rush toward America's new energy reality.
MATTHEW R. AUER Bloomington, Ind., June 10, 2012
The writer is a professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University.
To the Editor:
Daniel Yergin leaves out the main issue by not mentioning the word climate even once. If we burn all that oil and gas, the planet will warm beyond tipping points with catastrophic consequences.
DAVID FENTON New York, June 10, 2012
To the Editor:
Daniel Yergin's superb essay did not mention one startling and potentially transformative development recently announced by the Obama administration. The Green River Formation, which lies beneath a largely vacant area of mostly federal land where Colorado, Utah and Wyoming come together, contains about three trillion barrels of oil. Depending on the available technology and current regulations, about half of the oil there may be recoverable, an amount about equal to the entire world's proven oil reserves.
One major impediment is its location beneath federal land. A reasonable policy balance should be achieved to bring these vast oil reserves to market while properly stewarding our environmental resources.
JOHN SITILIDES McLean, Va., June 11, 2012
To the Editor:
Given that the American Petroleum Institute's hydraulic fracturing standards and best practices were influential in the development of the International Energy Agency's ''golden rules'' for natural gas development, your suggestion that the report be required reading for America's natural gas industry seems superfluous (''Natural Gas, by the Book,'' editorial, June 10).
The agency's report reinforces A.P.I.'s effectiveness as a global leader in natural gas industry standards and its commitment to the safe and responsible development of energy from shale.
Our industry supports responsible regulation and, working with governments at all levels in New York and elsewhere, has sought to ensure that all concerns about the development of shale oil and natural gas are addressed properly. For the record, all the concerns you list are addressed in New York regulations or those proposed by the Department of Environmental Conservation.
KAREN MOREAU Executive Director New York State Petroleum Council Albany, June 12, 2012
To the Editor:
Your editorial in favor of properly regulated hydrofracking was right on the mark. Hydrofracking can have significant economic and environmental benefits for our country and the world. The one negative I see in hydrofracking is that it could slow down the development of renewable energy.
Therefore I suggest a small tax be placed on hydrofracking production that is used to support the development of renewable energy. Scalable, economical renewable energy may be decades away, and we need to support its development.

HEADLINE: Dip in Manufacturing Suggests a Stalled U.S. Economy

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- Factory output contracted in May for the second time in three months, the Federal Reserve said on Friday, and families took a dimmer view of their economic prospects in early June, signs that the economy's recovery is on shaky ground. 
The new data was the latest in a series of reports portraying a weak economy that have led analysts to cut growth forecasts while raising expectations that the Federal Reserve will offer new stimulus measures.
Until recently, manufacturing had been a buttress for the nation's economy, helping it resist headwinds from Europe's snowballing debt crisis.
But in May, factory output shrank 0.4 percent, with plants producing fewer cars and less machinery, Federal Reserve data showed.
''It's more convincing evidence that the economy is stuck in low gear,'' said Joe Manimbo, a market analyst at Travelex Global Business Payments.
Other reports pointed to cooling factory activity in New York State this month, along with a drop in household confidence in the economy.
The fall in confidence poses a serious threat to President Obama's chances of winning re-election in November. It could also lead consumers to cut back on spending, which would reduce economic growth.
''Consumers are scared,'' said Sharon Stark, managing director at Sterne Agee in Birmingham, Ala.
Consumer sentiment fell in early June to a six-month low. A gauge of household confidence in the economy's future also dropped to its lowest since December.
The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan's index on consumer sentiment slipped to 74.1, falling short of even the most pessimistic forecast in a Reuters poll.
Economists at Capital Economics reckon the decline in consumer sentiment is consistent with growth in consumer spending slowing to a mere 1 percent annual rate in the second quarter, down from 2.7 percent in the first three months of the year.
The weakening recovery in the United States and a worsening debt crisis in Europe have bolstered expectations of a further easing of monetary policy by the Fed, although economists are divided on whether the central bank will act when it meets on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Hiring by the nation's employers has slowed for four consecutive months, while retail sales contracted in May and new applications for jobless benefits have risen in five of the last six weeks.
Within the Fed's report on U.S. industry in May, the softness in the factory sector was widespread.
Output for durable goods dropped 0.5 percent as auto production slid 1.5 percent. Production of nondurables fell 0.2 percent.
Total industrial output, covering factories, mines and utilities, declined 0.1 percent. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected industrial production to rise 0.1 percent.
In a sign the factory sector's weakness could continue into June, the New York Federal Reserve Bank's Empire State index fell to 2.3, a 15-point drop from the previous month and the lowest level since November 2011.
That was far below economists' expectations of 13, although the level still points to some growth.
''That is another indication that the U.S. economy is slowing,'' said Justin Hoogendoorn, a fixed-income strategist at BMO Capital Markets in Chicago. ''It's an ugly situation.''

PERSON: Ruth Sims 

HEADLINE: Ruth L. Sims, 92, First woman Elected to Lead Greenwich

BYLINE: By DANIEL E. SLOTNIK

 BODY:
Ruth L. Sims, a Democrat who in 1977 became the first woman elected to lead historically Republican Greenwich, Conn., in a race that required two recounts and a second vote, died on June 7. She was 92. 
Her son, Christopher, said she died at an assisted living facility in Skillman, N.J.
Mrs. Sims was the first Democrat elected to Greenwich's highest executive position, first selectman, in more than 70 years.
Running against an incumbent Republican, Rupert Vernon, Mrs. Sims, a director of the Southern New England Telephone Company, was initially declared the winner by six votes. Two days later, a recount gave Mr. Vernon victory, by one vote. Mrs. Sims successfully challenged the recount, contending there were irregularities involving 545 absentee ballots. In a second recount, she came out ahead by one vote, but a judge declared the race a tie and ordered a new election.
The race was decided on Dec. 29 in that election, which Mrs. Sims won by a surprisingly wide margin, 13,962 to 9,361. The turnout was a record for Greenwich, which had 17,812 registered Republicans, compared with 7,281 Democrats.
She won a second term in 1979, defeating Albert F. Varner Jr. by fewer than 200 votes, and retired in 1981.
During her tenure, Mrs. Sims steered the transition of the Cos Cob power plant from coal- to oil-fired burners, reducing pollution; championed subsidized housing for the elderly; and fought to preserve Greenwich's residential character in the face of corporate development and a tide of commuting traffic, an increasing concern in a town long known as a quiet bastion of old-money wealth.
Ruth Bodman Leiserson was born on March 4, 1920, in Rochester. She graduated from Oberlin College with a bachelor's degree in English and married Albert G. Sims in 1941. Before her election, she was a national director of the League of Women Voters.
In addition to her son Christopher, who received the 2011 Nobel in economic science, Mrs. Sims is survived by another son, William; a daughter, Jennifer; a sister, Sally Lamar; a brother, Philip Leiserson; seven grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Studies Find That Gossip Isn't Just Loose Talk

BYLINE: By ALINA TUGEND

 BODY:
GOSSIP. Almost all of us do it, most of us are embarrassed about it, and sometimes, to our horror, we get caught.
But not all gossip is bad, and, in fact, gossip can be useful in maintaining social norms and keeping people in line.
Maybe it sounds as if I'm just trying to rationalize the desire to sometimes spread a few juicy bits of information, but recent research looks at the good side of gossip.
First, the definition of gossip is fairly neutral. As Robin Dunbar, an anthropologist and evolutionary psychologist at the University of Oxford who has written widely about gossip, notes, the word gossip originally just meant chatting with one's ''godsibs,'' or the peer equivalent of godparents -- in other words, people you were particularly close to.
In more modern terms, Timothy Hallett, associate professor in the Indiana University sociology department, defined it as ''the unsanctioned evaluative talk about people who aren't present.'' 
While the idea that gossip is universal and serves some useful societal needs has been a topic of discussion among academics in the past, a new study from the University of California, Berkeley looks more closely at its social and psychological benefits.
''The normal view of gossip is that it's always bad, and a lot of gossip is bad,'' said Robb Willer, an assistant professor of sociology at Berkeley and a co-author of the study. ''But it does serve an important function.''
The study, ''The Virtues of Gossip,'' published in the May issue of The Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, found that gossip can play the role of protecting others from being exploited by passing on information about bad behavior to warn others.
''If you tell people that this person is a selfish jerk, people learn to avoid the exploitive jerk,'' said Matthew Feinberg, a postdoctoral student at Stanford University and a co-author of the study.
Professor Willer said: ''We sometimes need to trade information with third parties about people who aren't around in order to learn from other people's experiences.''
Of course, the assumption here is that people are always telling the truth and not spreading lies or private stories that they know will cause pain. But Professor Willer said that, while such negative gossip exists, it is useful to look at how other types of gossip can play a valuable role in society.
One experiment in Professor Willer's study showed how just the threat of gossip could encourage people to be nicer. About 300 participants, recruited from Craigslist, played an economic trust game online using raffle tickets that would be entered for a $50 drawing.
They knew that they could be observed and gossiped about if they did not play fairly, and that spurred virtually all the participants to be more generous, the authors said.
''We're not saying all gossip is virtuous, but it does serve a purpose from the perspective of the group,'' Dr. Feinberg said.
People also feel a tremendous need to gossip -- that is, to tell others about someone's bad behavior behind his or her back -- when they perceive that person is acting unfairly.
In a few experiments in the same study, players' generosity toward each other was measured by how many dollars or points they shared. In the first experiment, 51 volunteers were hooked up to heart rate monitors as they observed the scores of two people playing the game. After a while, it was clear one player was violating the rules and hoarding all the points.
The heart rates of the observers increased as they watched the cheating, and most took advantage of the opportunity to slip a ''gossip note'' to warn a new player that her opponent was probably not going to play fair.
The heart rates went down once the observers had the opportunity to ''tattle.''
Gossip's role as a means of ensuring that individuals don't take advantage of a group was also demonstrated by research by two Dutch academics
Bianca Beersma, an associate professor of work and organizational psychology, and Gerben van Kleef, a professor of social psychology at the University of Amsterdam, told a group of people that they had been randomly chosen to distribute 100 tickets for a lottery with a cash prize. The participants could either generously distribute the tickets to others or selfishly keep many tickets for themselves.
Half the time, the participant was told the choice would be kept private and no one would know. The rest of the time, the decision would be publicized in the group.
In addition, participants were sometimes told that other group members were likely to gossip; other times they were told their actions probably would not be discussed.
Now, people being people, all the players acted selfishly to some degree, keeping more for themselves than they gave to the others. But when they knew their actions were public and the chance of gossip was high, they became quite a bit less selfish, Professors Beersma and Van Kleef found.
Their study, ''How the Grapevine Keeps You in Line: Gossip Increases Contributions to the Group,'' appeared in the April 12, 2011, issue of the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science.
Not surprisingly, a lot of people do not agree that gossip serves any positive purpose. Beth Weissenberger, co-founder of the Handel Group, an executive coaching company, says the first thing she does when consulting is to ban gossip.
''Gossip is a manipulation,'' she said. ''It's a form of being a chicken.''
For example, she said, if a subordinate discovers that her boss is taking full credit for her work, what is she likely to do? ''You go underground and tell your colleagues that he's a jerk,'' Ms. Weissenberger said. ''Great, now you have four people who agree with you, but you're still upset. We say you have to have the honest confrontation.''
But others do not see prohibiting gossip as the answer.
''I wouldn't advocate a no-gossip policy,'' Professor Hallett said. ''The point is, if you know how gossip works, you can manage and control it.''
He and his co-authors videotaped workplace politics at an urban elementary school. The research initially was not intended to study gossip, but the academics saw that gossip played an important role in the school staff.
What was interesting, Professor Hallett said, was how gossip that occurred in the meetings differed from casual gossip in informal settings. Both were usually negative, yet the gossip in the formal meetings tended to be more subtle and nuanced.
This included using sarcasm or veiled criticism like, ''When the old principal was here, things ran so smoothly,'' implying, Professor Hallett said, that things were not going so well now.
Knowing this about gossip in formal settings, Professor Hallett said, can allow the leader to address it. ''If someone is sarcastic, you can jump in and say, 'What do you mean?' ''
The trick, Professor Willer said, is to learn to navigate between helpful and malicious or unreliable gossip.
So it makes sense to me that gossip can serve a purpose in keeping people in line and reinforcing some important societal norms. But I also think we need to be careful not to give ourselves too broad a license. After all, a little gossip goes a long way.

HEADLINE: The Health Care and Broccoli Analogy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''How Broccoli Landed on Supreme Court Menu'' (front page, June 14):
It is difficult to discern whether the flawed ''broccoli is like health care'' analogy raised by Justice Antonin Scalia of the Supreme Court is the product of willful ignorance or ideology. 
As Paul Krugman and many other economists have pointed out, people who choose not to buy (or cannot afford to buy) broccoli do not drive up its cost and make it unaffordable to those who need and want it.
But all of us who need and want health insurance pay for those who do not have it. Everyone, sooner or later, gets seriously ill or injured.
The uninsured patient comes to the hospital and in many cases incurs costs running to the hundreds of thousands of dollars. The hospitals, unable to absorb those costs and survive financially, shift costs to those who are insured by raising their rates for everything from room charges to every diagnostic and therapeutic procedure. The health insurance company, faced with paying for those claims, raises its premiums.
Whether we are publicly or privately insured, we all pay more, and the national cycle of escalating health care costs goes on. That's not broccoli; it's interstate commerce.
At its root, the use of this false broccoli argument is an attack on the concept of a common good, the reality that we are all in this together, and the idea that the government has a legitimate stake in the health of our population.
Its use by the Supreme Court bodes ill for us all.
H. JACK GEIGER Brooklyn, June 14, 2012
The writer is professor emeritus of community medicine at the City University of New York Medical School.
To the Editor:
It's astonishing that the broccoli metaphor for mandatory health insurance seems to have the power your article suggests. The response is simple. The government cannot make you eat broccoli no matter how good it is for you. That infringes your privacy and invades your person.
But the government can make you pay for broccoli if there is a rational reason to do so. Indeed, it may have done so for all I know, because the government has often taken our taxes and paid farmers to grow or not grow particular crops.
It is the same with health insurance. The government under well-established but perhaps now precarious precedent can make you pay for health insurance, but just as it can't make you eat your broccoli, it cannot make you use your health insurance.
But I'll bet that once you've paid for health insurance you'll use it; the same may not be true of broccoli.

HEADLINE: Transcript of Obama's Speech on Immigration Policy

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
The following is the full text of President Obama's speech on Friday from the Rose Garden.
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Good afternoon, everybody.
This morning, Secretary Napolitano announced new actions my administration will take to mend our nation's immigration policy, to make it more fair, more efficient and more just, specifically for certain young people sometimes called DREAMers.
Now, these are young people who study in our schools, they play in our neighborhoods, they're friends with our kids, they pledge allegiance to our flag. They are Americans in their heart, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper. They were brought to this country by their parents, sometimes even as infants, and often have no idea that they're undocumented until they apply for a job or a driver's license or a college scholarship.
Put yourself in their shoes. Imagine you've done everything right your entire life, studied hard, worked hard, maybe even graduated at the top of your class, only to suddenly face the threat of deportation to a country that you know nothing about, with a language that you may not even speak. 
That's what gave rise to the Dream Act. It says that if your parents brought you here as a child, you've been here for five years and you're willing to go to college or serve in our military, you can one day earn your citizenship. And I've said time and time and time again to Congress that -- send me the Dream Act, put it on my desk, and I will sign it right away.
Now, both parties wrote this legislation, and year and a half ago, Democrats passed the Dream Act in the House, but Republicans walked away from it. It got 55 votes in the Senate, but Republicans blocked it. The bill hasn't really changed; the need hasn't changed. It's still the right thing to do. The only thing that has changed, apparently, was the politics.
Now, as I said in my speech on the economy yesterday, it makes no sense to expel talented young people who, for all intents and purposes, are Americans. They've been raised as Americans, understand themselves to be part of this country. To expel these young people who want to staff our labs or start new businesses or defend our country simply because of the actions of their parents or because of the inactions of politicians -- in the absence of any immigration action from Congress to fix our broken immigration system, what we've tried to do is focus our immigration enforcement resources in the right places. So we prioritize border security, putting more boots on the southern border than at any time in our history.
Today there are fewer illegal crossings than at any time in the past 40 years. We focus and use discretion about whom to prosecute, focusing on criminals who endanger our communities rather than students who are earning their education. And today deportation of criminals is up 80 percent. We've improved on that discretion carefully and thoughtfully.
Well, today we're improving it again. Effective immediately, the Department of Homeland Security is taking steps to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people. Over the next few months, eligible individuals who do not present a risk to national security or public safety will be able to request temporary relief from deportation proceedings and apply for work authorization.
Now, let's be clear. This is not amnesty. This is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It's not a permanent fix. This is a temporary, stopgap measure that lets us focus our resources wisely while giving a degree of relief and hope to talented, driven, patriotic young people. It is the -- it is the right thing to do.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic.)
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Excuse me, sir. I -- the -- it's not time for questions, sir.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic.)
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I -- not while I'm speaking.
Precisely because this is temporary, Congress needs to act. There's still time for Congress to pass the DREAM Act this year, because these kids deserve to plan their lives in more than two-year increments. And we still need to pass comprehensive immigration reform that addresses our 21st-century economic and security needs; reform that gives our farmers and ranchers certainty about the workers that they'll have; reform that gives our science and technology sectors certainty that the young people who come here to earn their Ph.D.s won't be forced to leave and start new businesses in other countries; reform that continues to improve our border security and lives up to our heritage as a nation of laws and a nation of immigrants.
Just six years ago, the unlikely trio of John McCain, Ted Kennedy and President Bush came together to champion this kind of reform, and I was proud to join 23 Republicans in voting for it.
So there's no reason that we can't come together and get this done. And as long as I'm president, I will not give up on this issue, not only because it's the right thing to do for our economy -- and CEOs agree with me -- not just because it's the right thing to do for our security, but because it's the right thing to do, period. And I believe that eventually enough Republicans in Congress will come around to that view as well.
And I believe that it's the right thing to do because I've been with groups of young people who work so hard and speak with so much heart about what's best in America, even though I knew some of them must have lived under the fear of deportation. I know some have come forward at great risks to themselves and their futures in hopes it would spur the rest of us to live up to our own most cherished values. And I've seen the stories of Americans in schools and churches and communities across the country who stood up for them and rallied behind them, and pushed us to give them a better path and freedom from fear, because we are a better nation than one that expels innocent young kids.
And the answer to your question, sir -- and the next time I prefer you let me finish my statements before you ask that question -- is this is the right thing to do for the American people. They -- I didn't -- I didn't ask for an argument, I'm answering your question.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic.)
PRESIDENT OBAMA: It is the right thing to do for the American people, and here's why.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Off mic) -- high unemployment.
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Here's the reason -- because these young people are going to make extraordinary contributions and are already making contributions to our society. I've got a young person who is serving in our military, protecting us and our freedom. The notion that in some ways we would treat them as expendable makes no sense.
If there's a young person here who has grown up here and wants to contribute to this society, wants to maybe start a business that will create jobs for other folks who are looking for work, that's the right thing to do. Giving certainty to our farmers and our ranchers, making sure that in addition to border security, we're creating a comprehensive framework for legal immigration -- these are all the right things to do.
We have always drawn strength from being a nation of immigrants, as well as a nation of laws. And that's going to continue. And my hope is that Congress recognizes that and get behind -- gets behind this effort. All right? Thank you very much, everybody.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: (Inaudible) -- specifically ruled this our, sir, last year.
AUDIENCE MEMBER: What about American workers who are unemployed while you employ foreigners? END

HEADLINE: German Rectitude Has Its Risks

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
As markets pummeled Spanish and Italian government bonds this week after Europe's latest effort to contain the euro crisis, Germany seemed increasingly isolated in its demands for more austerity. The June 9 cover of The Economist portrayed the world economy as a sinking oil tanker with the caption, ''Please can we start the engines now, Mrs. Merkel?''
In the United States, the Obama administration has been urging Germany for months to loosen its tough conditions for helping its euro zone brethren. Germany's chancellor, Angela Merkel, lost an ally last month when France's Francois Hollande, who campaigned for more stimulus and less austerity, defeated Nicolas Sarkozy. As recession- and riot-stricken Greece prepares to vote this weekend, evidence is mounting that the German-mandated cold shower isn't working.
So why is Germany being so intransigent? 
''The Germans aren't crazy,'' Jacob Kirkegaard, an economist and European specialist at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told me this week. ''They've read the same economics texts. They understand Keynesian economics and the case for stimulus.''
He and other economists I spoke to this week ascribed Germany's stance to a combination of character, politics and economics -- and not so much the scars of World War II or the prewar inflation that ravaged Germany. Many Germans ''are like the Swabian housewife,'' Peter Bofinger, a German economist and member of the German Council of Economic Experts, told me. (Swabians, from southwest Germany, are known for both their frugality and their strong work ethic, and Ms. Merkel lauded the Swabian homemaker in a 2008 speech.) ''If you're spending too much, then you have to stop, and it's better to stop now than tomorrow,'' he said. ''Our finance minister is fond of saying that in his hometown, Freiburg, they say, 'If everyone sweeps his own doorstep, the entire city will be clean.' ''
He added, ''There's a strong sense of fiscal rectitude and this is bolstered by a popular press that at every opportunity has conveyed the impression that countries like Greece, Portugal, Spain and Italy haven't done very much or tried very hard. Now, we have to bail them out. Why should we?''
Among Germany's leaders, ''There was a belief that these countries have to go through the pain and then it gets better,'' he added. ''They've committed a sin and now, to stop them from doing it again, they must suffer in purgatory.''
The German attitude isn't that different from that of many Americans, who are still angry that Wall Street bankers were bailed out with tax dollars rather than punished for their profligacy.
Besides the moral hazard issue, German leaders have other political issues to contend with. ''Applying a Keynesian perspective to the German approach is entirely misguided,'' Mr. Kirkegaard said. ''The Germans aren't looking at this from a short-term economic perspective. They view this, entirely correctly in my view, as a political crisis that can only be resolved with greater fiscal and political union to complement the monetary union. No country is going to voluntarily give up its sovereignty. Yet if German taxpayers are going to be liable for Italian debt, then they have to have some democratic say in how Italy runs its affairs and spends German money. Without that, it's illegitimate. The markets want this to be resolved yesterday, but this takes time and political preparation.''
Mr. Kirkegaard isn't alone in his view that a simple Keynesian approach to Europe would be misguided. ''The uber-Keynesians just want to see bigger deficits and more spending,'' said Sebastian Mallaby, a senior fellow for international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''We don't know what Keynes would have done because Keynes didn't live in world of huge budget deficits and massive sovereign debt. Spain was running a budget deficit in 2011 of 8.5 percent of gross domestic product. That's not sustainable. You need a path back to a sustainable budget, and that does require some belt-tightening. The Germans are right about that.'' He noted that the approach demanded by Germany isn't that different from what the International Monetary Fund has consistently extracted in numerous government rescue operations over the years.
But ''where the Germans have gone wrong,'' Mr. Mallaby contended, ''is the speed of the fiscal consolidation that they've mandated. You don't want to cut deficits so fast that the economy craters and you get riots in the streets. So you need to consolidate the budget but not so much that you kill the patient.'' He noted that during 2011, ''budget deficits were cut quite a lot in Europe, but the ratio of government debt to G.D.P. increased because economies were shrinking.'' The Germans ''need to be more generous.''
Mr. Bofinger takes a harsher view. ''Germany is responsible for the whole disaster,'' he said. ''It overemphasized fiscal consolidation. It's a one-dimensional view. German leaders genuinely believed that financial markets would reward fiscal rectitude with lower interest rates. That was naive. It didn't happen. The problem is, it isn't easy politically to make a 180-degree turn. The German public needs to be re-educated. It will take a lot of courage and leadership from Merkel.''
In the meantime, Europe seems destined to lurch from crisis to crisis -- but, in Mr. Kirkegaard's rosier view, will muddle through to achieve Germany's long-cherished dream for Europe, which is a closer fiscal and political union. ''One should not underestimate that the Germans will ultimately pay whatever it takes to make this work,'' he said. ''It's well understood among the German political elite and economic elite that no country has gained more from the euro than Germany. It has a massive export-based economy with a relatively weak currency, which is a tremendous benefit. Germany will write a check, but will only sign it on its terms. The way the German leadership views the crisis is simple: it's a way for them to get a better deal. That's why you see the same pattern. Angela says, 'No, no, no.' The crisis gets worse, Germany gains more concessions. Then she says, 'Yes.' ''
Mr. Kirkegaard said he realized this might be a contrarian view but, ''I think this is the only way forward.''
So, apparently, does Ms. Merkel. In a speech to Germany's Parliament on Thursday, she said ''no'' again. She acknowledged that ''all eyes are on Germany'' but staunchly rejected the notion of any ''miracle cures,'' like issuing euro bonds backed by Germany or guaranteeing bank deposits throughout Europe. She instead urged Europe to undertake the ''herculean task'' of political union. ''It is our task today to make up for what was not done'' when the euro was created, Ms. Merkel said, ''and to end the vicious circle of ever new debt, of not sticking to rules.''
The Germans have a point. Germany still has a triple-A credit rating and is in a position to rescue its more profligate neighbors for the very reason that the Germans have refused to write a blank check. But the danger is that Germany says ''no'' one time too many, pushing Europe and the world economy over the brink. With each failed effort to contain the crisis, that moment seems closer.

HEADLINE: Revamped Disney Park Tries Again

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Thousands of people camped on the street overnight waiting to get in. Media coverage by more than 400 print, online and broadcast outlets. Dozens of costumed characters foxtrotting to ''Ain't We Got Fun.'' Fireworks at 8 a.m.
This is what a Disney do-over looks like.
With military-style precision on Friday morning, the Walt Disney Company unveiled $1.1 billion worth of improvements to its California Adventure park here, a ''reopening'' intended to fix what Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, recently described as ''a brand eyesore.'' Adjacent to Disneyland but greatly lagging it in name recognition and profits, California Adventure has new features that include a 12-acre expansion dedicated to Pixar's ''Cars'' movies and the lavish re-theming of the park's entrance, where 1920s-era references to Walt Disney have replaced contemporary California imagery.
Mr. Iger arrived for the opening ceremony on a red trolley car, leaning from a window and beaming as he flashed a thumbs-up sign. ''I think we've pretty much nailed it,'' he said afterward, watching guests race from the front gates to Cars Land. 
Wall Street certainly hopes so. As the entertainment conglomerate leans harder on its $12 billion theme park business for growth, California Adventure is under pressure to at long last live up to its promise -- a tall order given the fragile economy. Opened 11 years ago on the old parking lot of the original Disneyland, California Adventure was intended to complement its sister park and turn Anaheim into a multiday vacation hub -- a kind of miniature Orlando, Fla., where Disney has six theme parks and three dozen hotels.
The idea was to induce people to come not just for a day but for a whole weekend or longer, preferably sleeping at Disney-owned hotels and eating in Disney-owned restaurants. Or so Mr. Iger's predecessor, Michael D. Eisner, envisioned.
But the new park, which had its own ticketing, restaurants and rides and thematic areas like a beach boardwalk and a Hollywood section, was a colossal disappointment. Visitors and the news media complained that the property lacked the company's trademark over-the-top design touches. Disney characters popped up infrequently. Moreover, the overall premise fell flat: California-themed rides for a California customer base?
The focus of the overhaul, five years in the making, was adding what Mr. Iger called ''Disney DNA'' -- more characters and experiences painstakingly engineered to tug at emotions. To that end, new rides are built around ''Toy Story'' and ''The Little Mermaid,'' and an $80 million fountain show combines music, lighting and 1,200 programmable jets of water to bring Disney characters to life.
California Adventure attracted about 6.3 million visitors last year, a trickle compared with the 16.1 million who swarmed Disneyland. Disney hopes the improved California Adventure will take some of the stress off its vaunted neighbor, which is often so crowded that guests are unpleasantly packed elbow to elbow.
But higher profit is the main goal, and that will come primarily from higher ticket prices. In preparation for the opening, Disney increased the cost for a two-day ''park hopper'' pass in Anaheim to $200 for visitors age 10 and up, compared to $173 previously. A successful California Adventure would lift spending at Disney's three hotels here, which were recently expanded and refurbished.
Disney does not report financial information for specific resorts, but its broader park operation has become a center for growth -- something that was considered next to impossible just a decade ago, partly because of tourism-related fears after 9/11. Last year, Disney's parks reported operating income of $1.6 billion, an 18 percent increase from a year earlier, on about $12 billion in revenue.
Disney is spending heavily to expand its vacation empire. Recent investments include the opening of an $850 million resort in Hawaii and two cruise ships built at a cost of over $1.8 billion. Disney is also spending about $1 billion to expand its Magic Kingdom resort in Florida and add an ''Avatar'' expansion to its Animal Kingdom park there.
The expansion comes as the United States economy sputters anew and Europe's fiscal crisis worsens, creating fears of a decline in consumer spending. During the recent recession, Disney discounted room rates to prop up attendance. In a recent research note, Todd Juenger, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, cautioned that so much expansion spending ''limits Disney's flexibility to reduce costs/capital in response to worsening economic conditions.''
But California Adventure may prove attractive enough for families to find the money to go even if they have to cut back in other areas, said analysts, several of whom raised their outlooks for Disney's stock price after viewing the expansion.
''The park has been fully transformed from a random collection of a couple great rides into a true Disney-worthy themed world,'' Mr. Juenger said, adding that he thought it would be ''increasingly impossible for a guest to visit Disneyland and not want to spend an entire day and night'' at California Adventure as well.
Thomas O. Staggs, chairman of Disney's parks division, said, ''People are still spending on vacations, but they are concerned about value, and they are getting that and more with our new product.''
Early reviews for the new California Adventure have been positive. The San Jose Mercury News deemed Radiator Springs Racers, which takes riders on a fast-paced journey through 280,000 square feet of faux rock mountains, ''Disney's best new ride in 35 years.'' The Los Angeles Times compared Cars Land and the park's new entrance, Buena Vista Street, to Universal Orlando's popular Wizarding World of Harry Potter.
Disneyland had a marred opening in 1955 -- shoes sank in fresh cement and a gas leak closed Fantasyland -- but everything went smoothly on Friday, despite ride lines that quickly stretched several hours. Disney left little to chance, importing teams of event employees from Orlando and its corporate headquarters in Burbank, Calif.
Koltyn Moore, 7, and Brayden Burgess, 6, were two of the first riders on Radiator Springs Racers, an honor that came with a price (if not a bedtime). They arrived outside the California Adventure gates at 5 p.m. on Thursday with their mothers to camp overnight. Brayden's assessment? ''You got to go really fast, and go inside the 'Cars' movie, and at the end you get sprayed with mist,'' he said. ''It was awesome.''

HEADLINE: In Euro Crisis, Obama Looks to Merkel

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and NICHOLAS KULISH; Mark Landler reported from Washington, and Nicholas Kulish from Berlin.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- At the end of a summit meeting at Camp David last month, as the other world leaders were heading for their helicopters, President Obama did what has become a habit during his years in the White House: he made time for an informal but deadly serious talk with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.
Sitting at a picnic table outside his cabin as the sun set behind the Maryland mountains, the two leaders chewed over the meeting -- one in which Ms. Merkel found herself under heavy pressure to respond more aggressively to Europe's financial crisis. ''You feel O.K. with where we are?'' Mr. Obama asked, according to one of his aides.
Ms. Merkel assured him that she did not feel overwhelmed by the demands of her fellow leaders, according to officials. Left unsaid was that Germany was still not ready to take the wrenching steps that Mr. Obama and others believe are needed to stop Europe's debt woes from cascading into a global economic storm. 
A collapse of the euro could derail America's fragile recovery and doom Mr. Obama's re-election hopes. So the president finds himself in the strange position of having forged a relationship with Ms. Merkel that is perhaps the best he has with any foreign leader, but that has not yet resulted in the chancellor's agreeing to what Mr. Obama thinks must be done in Europe: an American-style bailout and fiscal stimulus.
Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel will meet again Monday at a Group of 20 summit meeting in Mexico, with the stakes for Europe even higher than they were last month. With Greece holding elections on Sunday that could precipitate its exit from the European currency union -- the nightmare feared by the financial markets -- Mr. Obama may be running out of time to make his case.
And there is no indication Ms. Merkel is any more inclined to heed his advice. In a speech to the German Parliament on Thursday, she said the world should not expect Berlin to be Europe's savior, rejecting calls to create euro bonds to share the debt burden of the Mediterranean countries.
However acute the tensions, American and German officials insist they have not poisoned the dialogue between the two leaders -- carried out over 12 phone calls, 2 video conferences and 3 face-to-face meetings this year alone. In each exchange, their aides say, Ms. Merkel and Mr. Obama pick up where they left off, speaking -- in English -- with the brisk logic and lack of small talk one might expect from a physicist and a law professor.
''He has total respect for her,'' said Michael Froman, a deputy national security adviser who took part in the Camp David session. ''She's very Midwestern in her own way: she tells him exactly what she can and can't do, will or won't do.''
They also, their aides say, share a kinship of another kind.
''They're both kind of outsiders: an African-American from Hawaii and a woman from East Germany,'' said Benjamin J. Rhodes, deputy national security adviser for strategic communications.
That makes their relationship very different from those the president has built with other foreign leaders -- from the fiery back-and-forth he has had with Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to the earnest discussions about high school education with President Lee Myung-bak of South Korea. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy of France told people he found Mr. Obama ''cold, cold, cold.'' For Ms. Merkel, a little chill might be the right temperature for debating issues like bank recapitalization, debt sharing and fiscal integration.
It is not that Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel have failed to show each other warmth. The high point came last year when he awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. At a state dinner in the Rose Garden, she was served apple strudel and serenaded under the stars by James Taylor. His song: ''You've Got a Friend.''
Ms. Merkel eschewed her practical pantsuit for a black evening gown. Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel toasted each other -- she with red wine, he with white. At the end of the evening, an official said, she turned to her host. ''The next time you come to Germany,'' a beaming Ms. Merkel said, ''you can speak at any gate you want.''
It was a reference to their awkward start in July 2008, when Mr. Obama, then a candidate for president seeking to bolster his foreign policy credentials, sought to deliver a speech before the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin. Ms. Merkel let it be known that she frowned on his plan to use a site so freighted with historical significance for Germans. Mr. Obama's aides moved the speech.
The contretemps made headlines, but their private meeting at the Chancellery in Berlin went better. Ms. Merkel was surprised, aides said, by how far the young senator was from the political celebrity the German media had portrayed. Ms. Merkel found Mr. Obama to be, as she is, a detail-oriented wonk.
But the relationship was still not warm by any stretch, and at a meeting in Dresden, Germany, in June 2009, Mr. Obama went out of his way to chastise the press for speculating about disharmony.
From Dresden, Mr. Obama and Ms. Merkel traveled with the Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel to Buchenwald, the Nazi concentration camp. The trip was something of a turning point. Rather than treating the chancellor like the representative of a guilty nation, Mr. Obama was solicitous, even a little protective about the jostling photographers.
For Ms. Merkel, the president's cultivation carries a political bonus with a German public that is still enamored of him. ''For the head of the German government to be received so well in America has a very positive impact back home,'' said Gerd Langguth, a political scientist at the University of Bonn and a biographer of Ms. Merkel.
Still, their mutual high regard and constructive working relationship does not mask fundamental differences between German and American economic philosophies, and in their respective remedies for solving Europe's debt crisis. The United States is pushing Germany to accept some form of debt sharing, which many Germans regard as anathema, and to embrace a growth-oriented economic policy rather than relentless austerity.
''When it comes to Keynesianism, indebtedness, stimulus, Merkel simply has a different point of view, a traditional German point of view,'' Mr. Langguth said. And that is also the point of view of Mr. Obama's Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, who has turned the debate over the euro crisis into an American campaign issue. Last week, one of Mr. Romney's economic advisers, Glenn Hubbard, wrote an op-ed in a German newspaper urging the Germans to reject Mr. Obama's advice.
Ms. Merkel must also contend with a German public that is hostile to bailing out Greece, let alone Italy or Spain. Mr. Obama, his advisers say, is keenly attuned to her domestic political constraints.
Jackson Janes, executive director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies, said: ''There's a cold logic to her position. She's saying, 'Look, Mr. President, I have some problems that I need to respond to that don't correspond to your need to be re-elected.' ''
For all their disagreements over Europe, the two have ''exactly the same view'' on other thorny issues, from China and Russia to Iran and Afghanistan, said Klaus Scharioth, the German ambassador to Washington until last year.
At times, they can appear like an old couple ribbing each other about their idiosyncrasies. Walking through the White House together on a visit she made after the Buchenwald trip, Mr. Obama joked with the often-dour Ms. Merkel about her re-election campaign.
''Ah, you've already won,'' a wireless television microphone picked up Mr. Obama telling her. ''I don't know what you always worry about.''

HEADLINE: Romney's Bus Tour of New Hampshire Lets In a Bit of the Outside World

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
MILFORD, N.H. -- Mitt Romney was supposed to depart from his usual campaign approach on Friday, and he did -- though not the way his strategists had envisioned.
The candidate kicked off a five-day bus tour, an ambitious barnstormer through small-town America that was billed as an effort to introduce Mr. Romney to a new set of voters. And the first two events, including an ice cream social on the village green here, kept him solidly in his comfort zone.
But the effort to connect with voters amid folksy New England imagery competed with the unpredictable news cycle, as Mr. Romney was forced to wade gingerly into the debate about a new White House policy paving the way for the granting of work permits and temporary residency to some young illegal immigrants. 
Still, the scenery and theatrics of the first day of the bus trip set the tone the campaign hopes to convey over the coming days. After a live bluegrass show, with bales of hay in the background, Senator Kelly Ayotte introduced Mr. Romney as his campaign bus pulled up alongside the crowd on the Scamman Farm in Stratham. The music then switched from a Coplandesque anthem to Mr. Romney's rock theme, ''Born Free,'' as he and his wife, Ann, traversed a catwalk to the stage, encircled by the audience.
Mr. Romney said: ''President Obama's plans have Americans wondering whether our future can be as bright as our past. But that lack of faith is a bridge we cannot cross.''
He continued, ''That's why, from now until November, our campaign will carry a simple message: America's greatest days are yet ahead.''
From now until Tuesday, at least, Mr. Romney is carrying his message specifically to small towns in six states that Mr. Obama won in 2008 and which his campaign now sees as key battlegrounds: New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan.
''We'll be traveling on what are often called the backroads of America,'' Mr. Romney said. ''But I think our tour is going to take us along what I'll call the backbone of America.''
The hope is that after an intensive string of fund-raising activity, Mr. Romney's burst of retail campaigning can capitalize on a rough patch for Mr. Obama, helping Republicans finally gain an edge in some key battleground states.
In some ways, the first day's events seemed more of a warm-up than a representative example of the tour's stated goals. At the tour's outset, Mr. Romney's strategist said it would take the candidate to places that are ''not necessarily traditional campaign stops.'' That could, of course, rule out the entire state of New Hampshire, given its prominent role in the primary process.
The campaign also said the crowds would not necessarily be packed with supporters. But people who turned out invariably had Romney stickers and said they had received tickets from the campaign or from other Republican connections. And some of them drove up from Massachusetts.
That said, the two New Hampshire stops are in two of the three counties Mr. Obama won by the smallest margins in 2008: Rockingham County (Stratham), which Mr. Obama took by one percentage point, and Hillsborough County (Milford), which he won by three.
In Milford, after an introduction by former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota, who like Ms. Ayotte is part of a wide field of potential running mates, Mr. Romney mocked Mr. Obama's claims that the economy was improving.
Mr. Romney suggested a test: ''You can go to businesses around this square.''
He continued, ''You go through piece by piece his policies, and ask whether that made it easier to start businesses and open jobs.''
Doug Rutt was in the crowd because Nancy Hubert Real Estate, where he is an agent, is across the street from the Milford Oval. Even after Mr. Romney's speech, he remained undecided.
''I've been pretty disappointed in all the candidates,'' said Mr. Rutt, 64, who lives in nearby Brookline. ''Nobody seems to have a good idea.''
A registered independent, Mr. Rutt voted for Republicans until 2008, when he chose Mr. Obama. He called the economy's improvement ''anemic.'' However, he does not want to see Mr. Romney return to George W. Bush's economic policies by loosening banking regulations.
During his speeches, Mr. Romney did not address Mr. Obama's executive order to limit deportations of young people who came to the country illegally through no fault of their own. However, in a brief statement after scooping ice cream in Milford, Mr. Romney criticized Mr. Obama for making it ''more difficult to reach a long-term solution.'' He took no questions before reboarding his bus, decorated with a mural of silos, a quaint downtown, a lighthouse and other signifiers of small-town America.

HEADLINE: In Brooklyn, a Longtime Provocateur Surges in a Primary Race for Congress

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER and MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Suddenly, Charles Barron has regained the ability to shock.
The New York political world had long ago become accustomed to the incendiary words of Mr. Barron, a confrontational onetime Black Panther turned three-term City Councilman. His more outrageous remarks over the years, from calling Thomas Jefferson a pedophile to likening Gaza to a ''concentration death camp'' to expressing his desire to slap ''the closest white person,'' have given way to a reputation as a showboat and provocateur on the political fringe.
Considered an afterthought when he announced his candidacy for the United States Congress last November -- in a speech in which he called Muammar el-Qaddafi ''my hero'' and pledged to never salute the American flag -- Democratic leaders are now fretfully talking about a prospect they once considered unthinkable: a Congressman Barron. 
His opponent, Hakeem S. Jeffries, a state assemblyman and self-styled conciliator who has raised far more money and received far more support from the political establishment, was expected to coast to victory. So there was surprise when Mr. Barron picked up the endorsement of the city's largest public employees union and the blessing of the man he wants to replace, Representative Edolphus Towns, who will retire. With 10 days to go before the Democratic primary, it has became clear that Mr. Barron is gaining traction, with the help of a passionate voter base in the historically black Brooklyn neighborhoods where his roots run deep.
There are signs of panic among members of the Democratic establishment, who worry Mr. Barron could prove to be a headache in their ranks and an alienating figure on the national stage.
Popular Democrats abruptly emerged this week to denounce him as a dangerous, anti-Israel radical. Edward I. Koch, the former mayor, called him a viper; other community leaders pointed reporters to the Anti-Defamation League's list of his more provocative quotes; and in an e-mail to supporters this week, a local group of Russian Jews announced a hastily planned rally on Monday to denounce Mr. Barron as ''a fringe radical and anti-Semitic, anti-Israel activist.'' The first word of the subject line said it all: EMERGENCY.
In an interview, Mr. Barron would not comment on past statements, calling them ''a distraction'' from the issues, raised by people who are frightened by his campaign's ''building momentum.''
''Sometimes my being assertive and speaking truth to power become reduced to controversial and defiant,'' he said, adding later, ''I raise contradictions when I feel people who have suffered cause suffering to other people.''
The sudden rise in Mr. Barron's fortunes has overshadowed Mr. Jeffries, who has been viewed as a rising star in New York politics with his ability to bring together white and black, rich and poor, the gentrifiers and the gentrified. Mr. Jeffries's campaign chest is many times the size of Mr. Barron's, having collected by this week $769,544 from 2,447 donors. Mr. Barron missed a deadline to report his contributions, but said he had almost $70,000, most of it his own money.
In some ways, the race offers a contrast between two different eras. Mr. Barron, 61, represents a throwback to the 1970s and 1980s, when black nationalists seemed to control the city's racial conversation, while Mr. Jeffries, 41, represents the more recent model of black leaders like President Obama; Newark's mayor, Cory A. Booker; and Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, who have earned establishment credentials and thrived by building coalitions with white liberals.
That difference was suggested by Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke as she campaigned with Mr. Jeffries at the Abe Stark Senior Center in Canarsie. She said that Mr. Barron had a ''style of politics that appeals to some groups'' but that Mr. Jeffries represented ''the future of Brooklyn.''
Mr. Barron leavens his belligerent streak with humor, and has an engaging manner when it comes to the kind of small talk required while shaking hands with prospective voters at senior centers and subway stops. Even some of his opponents call him charming. And he has won deep support within his district for showing up at the scene whenever a young black person is wounded by the police.
The district, newly configured and renamed as a result of the 2010 Census, stretches through the spine of Brooklyn and spills over into Queens. It takes in the poor and working-class housing projects of Brownsville, East New York, Canarsie and Coney Island but also middle-class and increasingly affluent brownstone areas like Clinton Hill, Fort Greene and Prospect Heights, as well as the stouter homes of Manhattan Beach, Marine Park and Howard Beach. Both candidates are African-American in a district that is 53 percent black, but the outcome of the primary may hinge on the reality that the recent redistricting has introduced large pockets of white voters (22.4 percent) and Hispanic voters (18 percent). The district also includes large Jewish enclaves.
Because relatively few voters turn up in primaries -- particularly a primary held in June for the first time in 40 years -- the unions' ability to pull their members and other residents to the polls is regarded as crucial, according to Hank Sheinkopf, a political consultant. Mr. Jeffries has received a slew of union endorsements like those of the Transport Workers Union and 1199 SEIU, which represents health care workers. Mr. Barron surprised many in the political world when he snagged the support of DC 37, the city's largest public employees union. Both candidates claim records for addressing the district's perennial complaints: rundown housing, ineffective schools, wide unemployment and what many residents see as overly harsh police tactics.
But in contrast to many of the Democratic primary battles throughout the city, this one includes sharp policy differences between candidates. Mr. Barron opposes gay marriage; Mr. Jeffries co-sponsored the legislation that legalized it. Mr. Barron is an outspoken critic of Israeli policies; Mr. Jeffries visited Israel in 2008 with the Jewish Community Relations Council. Locally, Mr. Barron opposed the building of a basketball arena and the rest of the Atlantic Yards project near downtown Brooklyn; Mr. Jeffries has sought to mitigate its impact and criticized the developer for not delivering on promised housing.
And while Mr. Jeffries takes pride in his crossover appeal, Mr. Barron has made little effort to broaden his base. Instead, he continues to use loaded language, upsetting his white and Jewish colleagues with phrases emblematic of the Holocaust; he might, for example, accuse Israel of genocide. David Greenfield, a City Council member and the grandson of Holocaust survivors, said Mr. Barron, if elected, would become ''the most prominent anti-Semite in Congress.''
Mr. Barron, who has been married for 29 years to Inez D. Barron, currently a state assemblywoman, and has two grown children, Jelani and Jawanza, was raised in a housing project on the Lower East Side and graduated from Hunter College as a sociology major. He was chief of staff for a community activist, the Rev. Herbert Daughtry of Brooklyn's House of the Lord Church before running for the council in 2001. Privately, lawmakers say that Mr. Barron is a warm and earnest presence in the City Council, but say they have little patience for his antics. In 2010 Christine C. Quinn, the speaker, stripped him of his chairmanship of the Higher Education Committee.
Mr. Jeffries grew up in Crown Heights, the son of a social worker and a case worker, graduated from Binghamton University and received a law degree from New York University. He clerked for a federal judge, practiced law at the prestigious Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison firm for four years and won an Assembly seat in 2006. He lives in Prospect Heights with his wife, Kennisandra, and two sons, Jeremiah, 10, and Joshua, 8.
''Charles Barron has adopted a confrontational style,'' he said in an interview. ''I work hard to bring people together to get things accomplished. People will ultimately decide which approach is more effective.''

HEADLINE: Obama's Announcement Seizes Initiative and Puts Pressure on Romney

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER and TRIP GABRIEL; Reporting was contributed by Jonathan Weisman, Jackie Calmes and Jeff Zeleny from Washington, and Sarah Wheaton from Milford, N.H.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In many ways, President Obama's unilateral shift in immigration policy was a bluntly political move, a play for a key voting bloc in the states that will decide whether he gets another term. But as political moves go, it held the potential for considerable payoff.
It sent a clear signal to fast-growing Hispanic populations in Florida, Colorado, Nevada, Virginia and other states that he understood their frustration at his lack of progress so far in addressing problems with the immigration system and reducing the number of deportations.
After two weeks in which his re-election campaign often seemed to be struggling to cope with events and losing the upper hand to Mitt Romney, Mr. Obama, for a day at least, was able to drive the agenda. And the president's announcement put Mr. Romney, whose party is already split on the issue, in a tough spot, pressuring him to choose between further alienating Latino voters who chafed at the anti-illegal immigration stances he took in the primary season and alienating conservatives who reject policies resembling amnesty. 
The timing of the announcement appeared to have been carefully calibrated. Next week, Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama are scheduled to appear before a group of Hispanic elected officials on successive days in Florida, a ready-made opportunity for the president to draw a contrast in their positions before a swing-state audience. Mr. Obama is also scheduled to meet on Monday with a group of immigration activists at the White House. The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon, perhaps Monday, on Arizona's legislation that requires state law enforcement officers to check immigration status during traffic stops and makes it a crime for illegal immigrants to work in the state.
Especially with unemployment remaining high, the politics of immigration remain sensitive for both parties, with neither Democrats nor Republicans wanting to be seen as jeopardizing jobs for American workers. But polling suggests considerable public opposition in both parties to deporting people already in the country illegally, and support for steps that would allow otherwise law-abiding young people who arrived in the United States illegally to stay. The Obama administration had continued to deport illegal immigrants, including some young people, breaking up families and draining enthusiasm for the president's re-election among some Hispanic voters.
Democrats have long seen immigration as the best example of how Mr. Romney's move to the right during the bitterly contested Republican primary could complicate his ability to create a broad general election coalition. During the primary season, Mr. Romney opposed the Dream Act, proposed legislation that would have allowed many young illegal immigrants to remain in the country and would have given them a path to citizenship. As he has moved into the general election and confronted the need to compete for Latino voters, his campaign has tried to finesse the issue by saying that the focus of his outreach to Hispanics would be on jobs and the economy, and his initial response to Mr. Obama's decision on Friday was to focus less on its substance than its unilateral nature.
Speaking after an event in Milford, N.H., on Friday, Mr. Romney criticized the president's executive order for making it ''more difficult to reach a long-term solution'' for dealing with the fate of young people who are in the United States illegally ''through no fault of their own.'' Mr. Romney did not respond to questions about whether he would repeal Mr. Obama's order if elected.
In both substance and tone, his remarks were a softening of the posture he struck during the Republican primary fight, when he said he would veto any bill allowing children brought to the country by illegal immigrants to become permanent residents.
They should ''return home, apply and get in line with everyone else,'' Mr. Romney said in a debate in January.
His position apparently shifted under the influence of Senator Marco Rubio of Florida who has been preparing a Republican version of the Dream Act similar to what the president ordered Friday.
Congressional Republicans were more pointed in their criticism, but they too were careful not to oppose some kind of solution to the problem of young people who are in the country illegally but who are productive, otherwise law-abiding residents. Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, denounced it as ''possibly illegal'' for essentially bypassing lawmakers. Mr. Rubio said the announcement would be ''welcome news for many of these kids desperate for an answer,'' but that by going around Congress, the president had made it ''harder to find a balanced and responsible long-term'' solution.
Their caution reflected concern within the Republican Party that they are at risk of giving up a chance to win the political allegiance of Hispanics, not just for this election but for years to come. Though the Dream Act was originally co-sponsored by a conservative Republican, Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, in recent years most conservatives have worked to block any changes to immigration policies that would provide a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, and many conservatives have backed measures to limit the rights of illegal immigrants already in the United States.
But Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor, called this week for the party to do more to connect with Hispanic voters. And just before Mr. Obama's announcement, former Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi told reporters in Washington on Friday that Republicans, for political and business reasons, should support plans to let workers who are not citizens stay in the country.
''I believe America is in a global battle for capital,'' Mr. Barbour said. ''If you are a worker who has been here for any length of time, we have to have a path, not to citizenship, but a secure knowledge that they will be able to work.''
Many Hispanic leaders had been critical of the president for not doing more to address immigration. But on Friday, they said they welcomed his move, whatever his motivation. ''We know this is political -- we like that it's political,'' said Robert Meza, a Democratic state senator from Phoenix. ''People are smart enough to know that of course it's politics, but if their agenda moves forward, they're happy.''
Mr. Romney has warned that if Republicans did not find a better way to appeal to Hispanic voters, ''it spells doom for us.''
But his campaign has concluded so far that its outreach should be an economic message, not a modulation of the anti-illegal immigration stances Mr. Romney took during the primaries. His advisers observe that polls show Hispanic voters rank jobs and the economy their most pressing issues, followed by education.
Some advisers have argued that Mr. Romney has more to lose by exposing himself to charges of shifting positions over illegal immigration than he has to gain by appealing to a slice of the Latino constituency that ranks immigration a top concern -- because those voters already support Mr. Obama.

HEADLINE: Group of 20 to Urge Quicker Action in Europe

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The rest of the world has a message for Europe, whose intensifying debt crisis will dominate the agenda at the Group of 20 summit meeting next week in Mexico: Tell us how you will end this.
In recent days, world leaders have made increasingly blunt public statements about Europe as concerns about a Greek exit from the euro zone and Spain's ability to repay its debts have worried markets and weighed on global growth, already at a historically sluggish pace. 
Lael Brainard, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, said during a news conference on Friday that ''ensuring our European partners are escalating their response'' and getting European leaders to articulate their plan to end the market strife would be a top goal of world leaders at the meeting.
But experts said they expected few concrete, actionable agenda items to come from the conference, which formally begins on Monday in Las Cabos. Nevertheless, Group of 20 leaders plan to urge European leaders to describe their plans to calm the markets, including progress on their bailout funds and on building a closer financial union.
In advance of the meeting, world leaders have made increasingly sharp public statements on what is widely viewed as a too-little, too-late response by Europe.
Julia Gillard, the prime minister of Australia, and Lee Myung-bak, the president of South Korea, co-wrote a letter saying, ''We need a clear message from Europe that it is taking decisive steps to stabilize and strengthen its banks and that it is focused on restoring growth.''
The two leaders also warned about the ''human cost'' of the economic malaise and uncertainty.
Speaking at an event at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington on Thursday, Robert B. Zoellick, the outgoing president of the World Bank, said that Europe's string of ''a day late and a euro short'' policies had only made the crisis more costly.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner echoed those comments, speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington on Wednesday. ''If you wait to move on these things and you let the market get ahead of you, then you increase the cost of the solution,'' he said.
Mr. Geithner said Europeans had a ''big incentive'' to provide as much clarity and guidance to the world as they could. He said that his European counterparts were not ''minimizing risk,'' as they had done in the past. ''They are not telling us they have a whole bunch of time,'' Mr. Geithner said.
At the summit meeting, the world's leaders are expected to push Europeans to finish work on their bailout funds, and bolster their abilities -- allowing them to lend directly to banks, not just countries, for instance.
Officials in the United States and other countries are also expected to urge Europe to focus on growth by delaying some austerity measures, investing in infrastructure and carrying out labor market reforms.
Precautionary funds that the rest of the world has pulled together to guard against a deterioration of market conditions in Europe will also be on the agenda.
This winter, economists at the International Monetary Fund determined that the world needed an additional $1 trillion to ensure that all countries would maintain access to the debt markets at sustainable rates in the event of another financial crisis or spell of economic contraction.
European leaders agreed to bolster their bailout funds by about half that amount. That opened the door for the I.M.F. to raise $430 billion in pledges from its member countries.
Big, cash-rich emerging-market nations expected to provide much of the financing declined to name their precise contributions this spring, and were widely expected to announce how much they would be willing to offer at the Group of 20 summit meeting.
But some countries, including Brazil and China, are expected to continue holding off on making their contributions. For one, the emerging-market countries want to speed internal reforms at the monetary fund to give them more say within the institution. Second, some officials in big developing economies have expressed reluctance to giving more money to the I.M.F. to help stem the European crisis if the Europeans are not using more of their own resources and acting more decisively.
At a news conference on Thursday, Gerry Rice, an I.M.F. spokesman, denied that the fund-raising drive had stalled. ''Discussions have continued with the various donors,'' he said. ''It was never expected the package would be completed with every detail fixed by this time.''

HEADLINE: The Weekend Word: Executive Action

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at the president's weekly address and the latest happenings in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
The Obama administration announced an executive actionon Friday that will allow illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children to remain in the county without fear of deportation and be able to work, Julia Preston and John H. Cushman Jr. report. The policy, while not granting any permanent legal status, clears the way for young illegal immigrants to come out of the shadows, work legally and obtain driver's licenses and many other documents they have lacked.

        
President Obama's unilateral shift in immigration policy was a baldly political move, but it held the potential for considerable payoff, Helene Cooper and Trip Gabriel write. The president's announcement puts Mitt Romney in a tough spot, pressuring him to choose between further alienating Latino voters who chafed at the stances against illegal immigration that he took in the primary season and alienating conservatives who reject any policies that smack of amnesty.

        
Though her biography outlines a seemingly conventional course,Ann Romney casts herself as someone who has defied others' expectations, not endeavored to fulfill them, Ashley Parker writes in a profile of the presumptive Republican nominee's wife.

        
Many health care advocates are supporting the scheduled expansion of Medicaid - if the new law is upheld by the Supreme Court - saying it would greatly increase the number of people served, Robert Pear reports. However, many state officials, especially Republicans, worry that it will bring budget-breaking new costs.

        
Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, delivered an incendiary defenseof the free flow of campaign cash in the wake of the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision, while accusing President Obama of "attempting to change the First Amendment," Jonathan Weisman reports. Mr. McConnell has a policy agenda: Stopping the Democrats' Disclose Act, which seeks to speed up and broaden disclosure of campaign contributions.
Weekly Address

        
President Obama used his weekly address to target what he asserts to be the main force holding the nation back from increased economic growth: a stalemate in Washington. "On most of the ideas that would create jobs and grow our economy, Republicans in Congress haven't lifted a finger. They'd rather wait until after the election in November," he said. "I think that's wrong." He implored Congress to immediately pass a jobs bill "to help states put thousands of teachers, firefighters and police officers back on the job." He also asked them to pass a bill aimed at helping unemployed construction workers, and another that assists with moving expenses for companies that bring jobs back to America. "Every problem we face is within our power to solve," Mr. Obama said. "What's lacking is our politics. Remind your members of Congress why you sent them to Washington in the first place."
Happenings in Washington

        
Education Secretary Arne Duncan will speak at the United States Presidential Scholars Medallion ceremony on Saturday. More than 140 high school seniors are being honored for outstanding academic achievement and public service.

HEADLINE: Romney Accidentally Puts Obama in Governor's Office, but Goes With the Idea

BYLINE: ASHLEY PARKER


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney says perhaps Barack Obama should have spent some time running a state. 

 BODY:
WEATHERLY, Pa. - At an early morning stop on Saturday here in Weatherly - a town in a county in which President Obamabarely eked out a victoryfour years ago - Mitt Romney had some backhanded advice for the president.
After starting to comment about how Mr. Obama did not understand entrepreneurship in the free economy, Mr. Romney stumbled briefly, confusing Mr. Obama's political rsum: "He upon becoming governor - excuse me, president last time - governor might have been a better job for him to have started with," Mr. Romney said, to applause.
Then Mr. Romney ran with the conceit, adding that Mr. Obama might have been better served by spending time as a governor, as Mr. Romney did in Massachusetts.
"I say that because I actually think you learn from experience," Mr. Romney said. "I think it helps to have been in business before you actually start to run something in government. And then after you've done something in government, it helps to start perhaps a little lower level before you become president."
Mr. Romney, on the second day of his "Every Town Counts" bus tour, also left a scrawled note for reporters traveling with him on the press bus.
"You guys have it way too soft - nice ride," he wrote, signing off with a simple, "Mitt." He then added, as a postscript, "Erased your hard drives."
It was unclear if Mr. Romney was making a joke, or alluding to an episode first reported by The Boston Globe, in which just before leaving the governor's office, Mr. Romney and 11 of his top aides bought their state-issued computer hard drives and wiped them clean.

HEADLINE: Sunday Breakfast Menu, June 17

BYLINE: JADA F. SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney and representatives from President Obama's re-election campaign light up the Sunday shows for a debate on who wins the week in politics. 

 BODY:
As the presidential race heats up, Mitt Romney will appear on his first Sunday show -- other than Fox News -- to discuss the things both he and President Obama said last week on the campaign trail. David Plouffe, Mr. Obama's senior adviser, will make the network rounds as well, defending the president's words on the economy and promoting his new policy shift to cease deportations for some young illegal immigrants.
Mr. Romney will welcome Bob Schieffer of CBS's "Face the Nation" to the campaign trail this Sunday, as Mr. Schieffer shadows Mr. Romney, the Republican Party's presumptive nominee, on the journey he hopes will lead him to the White House. Mr. Romney will talk about his plans to bolster bipartisan cooperation before Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Howard Dean, 2004 Democratic presidential candidate, debate the former governor's November prospects in a political roundtable.
Mr. Plouffe will make appearances on ABC's "This Week," CNN's "State of the Union," FOX's "Fox News Sunday" and NBC's "Meet the Press." He will discuss the president's election strategy and specific details of Mr. Obama's economic message in battleground states. Later, Senator John McCain will join the debate on "Meet the Press," and Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, will weigh in on the recent series of alleged national security leaks, on "Fox News Sunday."
Former presidential contenders will add their campaign expertise as well. Rick Santorum will appear on "State of the Union" to discuss the conservative agenda, and Tim Pawlenty will sit in on "This Week" to debate the week's politics.
The new health care law also nears the top of the weekend agenda, with Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, giving the G.O.P. perspective on the Supreme Court debate regarding the law's constitutionality and its potential impact, on C-SPAN's "Newsmakers."
The subject will shift to middle class income and wealth on TV One's "Washington Watch." Cecilia E. Rouse, former White House economic adviser, will appear on the program to discuss a drop in household incomes nationwide, especially among African-Americans.
Bloomberg's "Political Capital" will feature an interview with Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Democratic member of both the Senate Budget Committee and the Armed Services Committee.

HEADLINE: Sympathy For the Radical Left

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
IT is difficult to envision an American parallel to Syriza, the far-left political coalition that has a chance to throw Europe into further turmoil with a victory in this weekend's Greek elections. But imagine a movement that combines elements from Occupy Wall Street and Ralph Nader's 2000 presidential campaign, and you have a sense of where Greece's leading opposition party would fit in the American political spectrum.
The party's full name translates as Coalition of the Radical Left, which sounds like something that Glenn Beck might have scrawled on his blackboard during the health care debates of 2009 but actually describes the party's supporters pretty accurately. Syriza is led by a former member of Greece's Communist Party, and its constituents range from socialists to Trotskyists to groups with beyond-parody names like the Renewing Communist Ecological Left. 
Greece is more hospitable to radical politics than the United States, but when Syriza was founded in 2004, it was strictly marginal. It took 3.3 percent of the vote in Greece's legislative elections that year, while the country's mainstream center-right and center-left parties won 86 percent of the vote between them.
But that was before the financial crash knocked over Greece's fiscal house of cards and made its entry in the European Union's common currency look like one of recent history's gravest blunders. Today the Greek unemployment rate is 22 percent, the youth unemployment rate is over 50 percent, and the country has no political mainstream anymore. In last month's legislative elections, the center-right party took 19 percent of the vote, the collapsing center-left party took 13 percent -- and sandwiched in between them was Syriza, with as strong a claim to legitimacy as either.
This weekend Greece is voting again, and the Coalition of the Radical Left has a chance to improve on that performance. If it does, and its leadership finds a way to form a coalition government, Syriza has promised to cancel the austerity program that the euro zone effectively imposed on Athens in exchange for loans and bailouts. In doing so, its leaders would be daring the E.U. to push Greece out of the currency union -- and the E.U. might have no choice then but to shove.
The elite consensus is that this would represent economic suicide for the Greeks, as well as a potential disaster for Europe as a whole. (And not only Europe: rest assured that the Obama White House, too, is praying that Syriza underperforms.)
This consensus is probably correct, and probably persuasive enough to prevent the Greek electorate from delivering the country into the hands of the far left. But there are two realities that explain why so many Greek voters find Syriza attractive.
First, recent experience has given ordinary Europeans no reason to trust elite predictions about anything. The entire E.U. project was hailed as a self-evident good by a generation's worth of statesmen and intellectuals, and Euroskepticism was confined in many countries to the fringes of the left and right. Now those fringes have been vindicated, and all the statesmen and intellectuals stand exposed.
Yes, a Greece that had never joined the euro wouldn't have prospered as much during the fat years of the 2000s. But as in the United States, much of that growth has turned out to be illusory. And when a system the entire European establishment promised would deliver prosperity and stability delivers political paralysis and 20 percent unemployment, it becomes hard to convince voters that they have much to lose by listening to extremists and radicals instead.
Second, countries that vote to stay the course now may find that they lose their right to vote at all in the future. The answer to the current crisis, every eurocrat agrees, is further integration: In the words of Germany's Angela Merkel, ''not just a currency union,'' but also ''a so-called fiscal union, more common budget policies ... [and] above all a political union.''
But as The Times's Floyd Norris noted on Friday, a recent speech by the head of the German Bundesbank suggests that such a union would feature a central authority empowered to bypass national governments whenever they turned uncooperative on budget policy. This would effectively turn the European Union into a kind of postmodern version of the old Austro-Hungarian empire, with a Germanic elite presiding uneasily over a polyglot imperium and its restive local populations.
There are worse political arrangements, certainly, than the old Hapsburg model. But that doesn't mean that voters in Greece (or Italy, or Spain ...) should be expected to quietly acquiesce to it.
This is the irony of Europe's current predicament. From the point of view of Berlin and Brussels, the only way to save the euro zone is to gradually take power away from voters on the grounds that they can't be trusted not to vote for radicals like Syriza.
But from the point of view of patriotic Greeks, it's precisely the threat of losing their sovereignty that might justify a vote for Syriza in the first place.

GOD OF SMALL THINGS
What Craig Venter is doing isn't all that radical. Humans have been meddling with plants and animals since the dawn of time. Just look at dogs, cows, pigs, wheat, corn, apples -- none of these things would exist in their current form without a domesticating human hand.
QED, New York, posted on nytimes.com 
Humans have a pretty poor record when it comes to tinkering with nature. Furthermore, those responsible for introducing alien life seldom live long enough to see the true downside of their labors, the negative effects that they never took the time to imagine in their rush to wealth and fame.
MFORD, Atlanta, posted on nytimes.com
The consequences of Venter's synthetic approach to life would be immense for a number of reasons (as outlined in the article), but one omitted is crucial to the debate on the existence of God. For many decades now, proponents of religion, creation and God have dismissed the chemical basis of cell evolution by simply criticizing our inability to create a cell from scratch. If Venter is successful in creating such a cell via synthetic biology, it will offer factual data to counter evolution's critics and add another major nail to the coffin of divine creation.
MICHAEL HADJIARGYROU, Coram, N.Y.
Venter's thinking too small. What I really would like to see is a bug that eats unsightly cellulite and poops U.S. currency.
KEITH A. MURPHY, Chicago, posted on nytimes.com
Why should we consider micro-organisms ''machines'' and not conclude that human organisms are also machines? Why not enforce changes in human behavior instead of manufacturing micro-organisms that sound convenient (to us, now)?
It's great that Venter shepherded the human-genome mapping to success -- that was a contained and nonharmful venture. But why not think of a way not to cause the toxification of the earth in the first place?

I'LL TAKE THE ROTHKO FOR $87 MILLION
Adam Davidson's column on the record prices in the contemporary art market supplies more evidence, as if it were needed, that rarefied prices have little to do with much of anything that makes sense. The art world is just a microcosm of the way the elite economy operates.
MICHAEL JOHNSTON, Hamilton, N.Y., posted on nytimes.com
When art becomes primarily an object to be bought and sold at market value, the entire purpose of artistic expression is sullied. It certainly is true that ''a thing of beauty is a joy forever,'' but these vulgar ''collectors'' buying art in the hope that it will ''pay off'' in appreciated value take all the joy out of it. If crass commercialism is unavoidable, at the very least artists should be able to avoid being exploited by the market. I would be in favor of a royalty system whereby the artist and her heirs share in the resale of her artistic works.
WILLIAM O. BEEMAN, Minneapolis, posted on nytimes.com
There is a vastly different art market out there from the one that Davidson describes: galleries featuring living, working artists in all sorts of media; art fairs; artists showing their work online. People will plunk down $200 for a new cellphone or $700 for a tablet that lasts -- what, three years? Or $20,000 for a car that might last 10? A thing of beauty is a joy forever, and it may cost only $300 or $3,000. Collect art because you love it. And if it turns out to increase in value over time, you can tell people how insightful you were to get it!

HEADLINE: When All Looks Bleak, Maybe It's Time to Invest

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
BANK bailouts, political upheavals, spiking bond yields and falling stock markets: the troubling headlines from Europe just keep on coming.
The details are as changeable as the euro-dollar exchange rate. Despite the announcement of a 100 billion euro bailout for Spanish banks last weekend, Spanish bond yields soared to new heights, a sign of worsening trouble. On Sunday, Greek voters are likely to voice disapproval of the fiscal austerity measures required for their country's bailout. This week, the euro zone's problems are expected to be a focus of the G-20 meeting in Mexico.
But if there's one constant, it's that Europe has been in a long-running crisis. And with great consistency, many investors have responded to this dismal drumroll by pulling their money out of European stock markets in search of safer assets, or those that seem so, with United States Treasuries near the top of the list. 
That's why the latest advice from Litman Gregory Asset Management, a financial services firm based in Orinda, Calif., is so startling: it may actually be time to start increasing investments in Europe.
''We think the markets have gotten ahead of themselves,'' said Jeremy DeGroot, the chief investment officer at Litman Gregory, in a telephone conversation last week. ''They've priced in so many problems for Europe that, on a relative basis, European stocks look very attractive for long-term investors.''
''Relative'' and ''long-term'' are the operative words here. Despite Litman Gregory's contrarian approach, Mr. DeGroot makes it clear he isn't sanguine about Europe's immediate prospects. ''I don't think we have a more optimistic view on that than the market consensus,'' he said.
In his view, neither the bailout of Spanish banks nor the Greek election is likely to resolve the problems of the euro zone. In the weeks ahead, he adds, volatility is quite likely to flare up again. And so we may well see a resumption of the flight to safety that has battered global equity markets and brought Treasury yields to extraordinarily low levels. Furthermore, in a period of weakness for Europe, the euro could well weaken further against the dollar, elevating the risk for investors in foreign stocks.
''We're really not very bullish on Europe for the short term,'' Mr. DeGroot said, adding that he was emphatically not urging investors to take a quick, deep plunge into the market in the hope of immediate gains.
But despite those caveats, he does see a compelling case for investors with at least a five-year time horizon to raise their exposure to European equities.
In a model portfolio for American mutual fund investors with a middle-of-the-road approach to risk -- a ''balanced'' portfolio with 60 percent of assets typically allocated to stocks and 40 percent to fixed-income holdings -- the firm suggests increasing exposure to European and other foreign stocks by a modest six percentage points. That would include two percentage points allocated specifically to an exchange-traded fund devoted entirely to Europe. And it would reduce investments in investment-grade and emerging-market bonds and in large-capitalization United States stocks by an equivalent six points.
The firm expects emerging-market economies to grow faster than those in developed countries, so it advocates increasing emerging-market investments, Mr. DeGroot said. But the main reason for ratcheting European exposure upward is less about Europe's potential than its prices: its stocks have become more attractive precisely because they have been beaten down so badly.
''The uncertainty stemming from Europe has led its equity markets to cheapen relative to the U.S. equity market to the extent that we believe Europe now presents an attractive tactical opportunity,'' the firm said in a note to subscribers of its No-Load Fund Analyst newsletter.
Over the last 12 months, for example, the CAC 40 stock index in France lost more than 24 percent, dividends included, when converted into dollars, while the IBEX, which tracks Spanish stocks, lost more than 36 percent, according to Bloomberg data. That compared with a total return of 8.5 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500.
Principally because of the lowered prices in Europe, Litman Gregory projects that the overall European stock market is likely to have a ''low double-digit return,'' annualized, over the next five years, compared with a 5 percent return in the United States stock market. These are only rough estimates, of course, and, given the downturns in recent years, they may seem overly optimistic.
''We don't want to give the impression of false precision,'' Mr. DeGroot says. But he says the data certainly suggests that, relatively speaking, the overall European stock market is now cheaper than that of the United States.
This is actually a widely held view, according to a BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research survey, conducted from May 31 to June 7 and involving 260 fund managers. Europe is the most undervalued region in the world, managers said in that survey -- but the question is what should be done about it. With the European crisis still very much unresolved, these managers have generally been shunning the euro zone's stock markets, a move that may have shielded them from even greater losses.
Mr. DeGroot, on the other hand, says he sees the values offered by European stock markets as a ''fat pitch'' -- although he isn't taking a very big swing at it right now because ''the short-term risk remains rather high.'' If conditions in Europe settle down, the firm is likely to recommend higher allocations.
But if you're concerned primarily about the next six months, and you're not willing to risk losing much capital, plunging deeply into European stocks may be the last thing you want to do.
That, of course, is the challenge of contrarian investing. The idea is to buy when the market is low, and to sell when it's high -- a feat that requires excellent timing and strong convictions.
Increasing exposure to Europe substantially in the middle of a crisis may not seem appealing. But it may be wise to start dipping your toe into the water.

HEADLINE: The Strange Career of Juan Crow

BYLINE: By DIANE McWHORTER. 
The author of ''Carry Me Home: Birmingham, Alabama, the Climactic Battle of the Civil Rights Revolution.''

 BODY:
THE depth of my alienation from home hit me last January, when Alabama shut out Louisiana State for the college football championship. Even in the familiar afterglow of 'Bama's second title in three years, I had to ask myself, what right did my state have to brag, about anything?
The pride of the Crimson Tide fan is just the relatively fun side of the state's reason-blind tribalism, the same hard-wiring that produced its other recent superlative, the ''toughest in the nation'' immigration law that made criminal suspects of an entire class of human beings -- and turned those who tolerated their presence into felon accessories. Thanks to H.B. 56 (the ''Beason-Hammon Taxpayer and Citizen Protection Act''), passed a year ago by the state's first Republican Legislature since Reconstruction, I am ashamed of being from Alabama. 
The contagion of Alabama's shame became apparent in April, during the oral argument before the Supreme Court on Arizona's immigration legislation, the test case for several similar state laws aimed primarily at Hispanics. All have been substantially blocked by federal courts, except Alabama's, most of which went into effect last fall, catastrophically achieving the goal Arizona calls ''attrition through enforcement'' -- also known as ''self-deportation.''
As the court seemed to cast a benign eye on the linchpin of the Arizona law -- the requirement that the police determine the immigration status of anyone they stop who invites ''reasonable suspicion'' of illegal residency -- I realized how dismayingly reliable Alabama remained as the country's moral X-ray, exposing the broken places. So on the eve of the Arizona decision, expected this month, it is useful to review what the imposition of ''states' rights'' on federal immigration policy looks like in the one state where this has been accomplished. If Alabama, the cradle of the civil rights movement, can retool Jim Crow as Juan Crow, what have we learned?
Since Alabama has no foreign border and a Latino population of less than 4 percent, the main purpose of H.B. 56 seems to be the id-gratification of tribal dominance and its easy political dividends. A bill co-sponsor, State Senator Scott Beason, was frank about his motive: ''when their children grow up and get the chance to vote, they vote for Democrats.''
Mr. Beason, who was later caught referring to blacks as ''aborigines,'' is from a predominantly white suburb of my hometown, Birmingham, which is gearing up for the 50th anniversary of our civil rights milestones of 1963: fire hoses and police dogs turned on child marchers and a church bombing that killed four black girls. For the 2013 ''celebration,'' the prize civic leaders were keeping their eyes on was the redemption that flowed from those debacles, notably the Civil Rights Act.
The city had nearly finessed that dialectic during the memorial in October for a local civil rights legend, the Rev. Fred L. Shuttlesworth. Flying into the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport, the protagonists of the movement -- Andrew Young, John Lewis, Joseph Lowery -- were greeted at the funeral by Gov. Robert Bentley with words of regret about his segregated youth. So cordial was the network of mutuality that it was at least an hour into the six-hour service before speakers pointed out that Governor Bentley had signed the immigration law that reinvented the sin from which Mr. Shuttlesworth had supposedly delivered us.
As a result, the yearlong anniversary is shaping up to be Groundhog Day. Among other injustices, H.B. 56 bars undocumented residents from pursuing work or entering into any state-related business transactions or private contracts, depriving them of basic dignities and due process. When the Justice Department investigated the state for demanding checks on schoolchildren, the defiant reaction of Alabama's attorney general prompted comparisons to George C. Wallace's 1963 ''Stand in the Schoolhouse Door'' at the University of Alabama.
At least one institution was primed to break out of the loop of bad history. Leading with a reference to the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 ''Letter From Birmingham Jail,'' some 150 ministers formally condemned H.B. 56 for preventing them from fulfilling the doctrine of the good Samaritan by making it illegal to give assistance to illegal immigrants, the basis of a suit against the state by three Christian denominations. A statement co-author, Matt Lacey, received dozens of e-mails from the law's defenders beginning, ''I'm a Christian but.'' They saw no distinction between the bureaucratic category of ''undocumented'' and the moral one of ''criminal'' -- a conflation that may also explain Justice Antonin Scalia's incredulous question to the solicitor general: ''Are you objecting to harassing the people who have no business being here?''
Indeed, the suffering of Alabama's Hispanics went mostly unnoticed until December, when Human Rights Watch issued a report describing entrepreneurs shuttering businesses, crime victims opting not to go to the police, parents fearing to seek medical help for children. These were the law's intended consequences: to attack ''every aspect of an illegal alien's life,'' said a co-sponsor, Micky Hammon, ''so they will deport themselves.''
Such unabashed malice made me realize that my shame was really a broken heart. The South's culture of kindness is real and must account for the most poignant theme of the Human Rights Watch report: how many of those repudiated ''aliens'' professed an attachment to Alabama. ''I love here,'' said a 19-year-old, in the state since he was 9. Now the cycle of bigotry is renewed, poisoning a new generation of Americans on both sides.
ALABAMA'S civic conscience stayed unperturbed until a media festival erupted over H.B. 56's unintended consequences: the brief detention in November of a German executive visiting the revered local Mercedes plant. Benz-gate, and the subsequent Barney Fife-ish treatment of a Japanese manager for Honda, combined with citizen annoyance over the new paperwork to convince the business community and much of official Alabama that H.B. 56 had to be ''fixed.'' A University of Alabama economist placed the law's damage to the state in the billions of dollars.
The symbols of redemption rallied. Civil rights and labor leaders traveled to meetings of shareholders, asking them to pressure Alabama for repeal. The annual re-enactment of the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery march for voting rights was refashioned as an anti-H.B. 56 protest. My heart began to mend at a perverse prospect: in half a century, would Alabama be honoring the remarkable community uprising that overcame H.B. 56? The coup de grace seemed to occur in March, when Mr. Beason lost his primary race for the House of Representatives.
''I had really hoped Alabama would be a place that could learn from its mistakes,'' Mr. Lacey warned me, ''but it doesn't want to be that.'' In May the Legislature passed an ''improved'' bill sponsored by Mr. Beason, even more severe than the original. It forced the police to obtain papers from passengers as well as drivers, and it ordered the state to maintain a database of known ''illegals,'' recalling antebellum ads spotlighting runaway slaves. The law still exempts domestics, observing the plantation hierarchy of ''house Negroes'' and ''field hands.''
Mr. Beason was most likely emboldened by the forecasts of a constitutional future for his Arizona template, which should impress the court with the gravity of its responsibility. Tempting as it is to raise the specter of 1896 -- Plessy v. Ferguson's ''separate but equal'' precedent -- the better analogy is the 1955 decision known as Brown II, which ordered Southern schools desegregated ''with all deliberate speed'' but left that task to the segregationists who provoked the humanitarian crisis in the first place.
We know how the fight will turn out, just as it was long obvious the Constitution could not condone segregation forever. But the fight will be ceaselessly reprised, shattering lives before the inevitable is allowed to happen.
At least in Alabama, the civil rights movement, like the football team, knows what it takes to win.

HEADLINE: So You Think You Can Be a Hair Braider. . .

BYLINE: By JACOB GOLDSTEIN. 
Jacob Goldstein is a reporter at NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog. Adam Davidson is off this week.

 BODY:
Jestina Clayton grew up in a village in Sierra Leone where every girl learns traditional African hair-braiding. Then, when she was 22, she moved to Centerville, Utah, a place where no one learns traditional African hair-braiding. So Clayton was pleasantly surprised to find a niche in the market among a small group of Utah parents who had adopted African children but didn't know how to style their hair.
Clayton moved to the United States as an 18-year-old and headed out to Centerville to be near her in-laws. After graduating from college, she considered getting an office job but decided instead to start her own hair-braiding operation and began advertising on a local Web site. ''It's not like it was bringing me millions,'' she says, ''but it was covering groceries.'' At least until a stranger who saw the ad e-mailed her a demand to delete it. ''It is illegal in the state of Utah to do any form of extensions without a valid cosmetology license,'' the e-mail read. ''Please delete your ad, or you will be reported.'' 
A cosmetology license required nearly two years of school and $16,000 in tuition. But Clayton hoped for an exemption. After all, many Utah cosmetology schools taught little or nothing about African-style hair-braiding, and other states allowed people to practice it after passing a hygiene test and paying a small fee. Clayton made her case (via PowerPoint) to the exhaustively named governing body of Utah hair-braiding, the Barber, Cosmetology/Barber, Esthetics, Electrology and Nail Technology Licensing Board. The board, made up largely of licensed barbers and cosmetologists, shot her down.
This isn't just a random Utah law. There are more than 1,000 licensed professions in the United States, partly a result of more than a century of legal work. As the country industrialized, state governments wanted to protect their citizens and create standards not just for lawyers and doctors but also for basic services. It didn't take long for professional groups to find that they also stood to benefit from the regulations. Over the years, more and more started to lobby for licensing rules, often grand/fathering in existing professionals while putting up high barriers to new competitors. In fact, businesses contorting regulation to their own benefit is so common that economists have a special name for it: regulatory capture. ''Everyone assumes that private interests fight like crazy not to be regulated,'' says Charles Wheelan, who teaches public policy at the University of Chicago. ''But often, for businesses, regulation is your friend.''
After being shot down by the board, Clayton allied with a Utah state representative who had adopted several children from Africa. The representative proposed a bill that would exempt hair-braiding from the cosmetology licensing law, but she was no match for the cosmetologists, who have started grass-roots campaigns in several states to fight the loosening of license rules. They turned out in full force in Utah. ''We encourage regulation,'' says Brad Masterson, a spokesman for the Professional Beauty Association. ''Why should everyone else who's doing hair have to conform to requirements and not her?''
Unfortunately, it's not that simple. Once upon a time, these barriers weren't such a big deal. In 1950, fewer than 5 percent of Americans worked in jobs that required licenses. Today, it's roughly 30 percent, and that number is likely to grow. In the coming years, global competition and the increasing rate of technological change will force many workers to bounce from career to career throughout their working lives. Nearly 13 million Americans are out of work; since the start of the recession, the manufacturing sector alone has lost about two million jobs. There's little doubt that laid-off factory workers will find themselves increasingly looking for opportunities in landscape contracting, athletic training and in hundreds of other professions that require licenses. ''When, say, the tattoo artists come up for licensure, nobody follows the debates, nobody outside the profession cares about the resolution,'' Wheelan says. ''You add up how many of these there are -- hundreds -- and suddenly we're talking about a sizable portion of the labor market.''
Almost nobody is calling for wholesale abolition of professional licensing. I sleep better at night knowing that the commercial pilots flying over my apartment are trained and licensed. A wide range of economists and activists, however, are looking for ways to loosen the rules in a productive way. Michelle Obama has been pushing to make it easier for military spouses, who move frequently, to pursue their careers in new states without bureaucratic entanglements. The Institute for Justice, a libertarian legal group, has filed lawsuits in several states arguing that certain licensing rules are ''arbitrarily interfering with citizens' ability to earn an honest living.'' The group, which represents Jestina Clayton in Utah, has filed cases on behalf of African-style hair braiders in several other states. Dean Baker, the well-known liberal economist, argues that if we have free trade for goods, we should also have it for high-end services.
A bolder idea, of course, would be for states to get rid of the licensing rules that are doing more harm than good. A group of economists, including Alan B. Krueger, now the chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, proposed something along these lines last year. But pushing this sort of policy, beyond being a logistical nightmare, can be ''political suicide,'' says Morris Kleiner, a University of Minnesota economist who co-wrote the proposal. ''When you talk about reductions in licensing, you have every occupation from the plumbers to the C.P.A.'s to the electricians lining up to argue why regulation should not be reduced,'' he says. Arguing for the other side you have, basically, Jestina Clayton.
This is the pattern that creates regulatory capture -- the people with the biggest stake in any regulation are usually the ones who are being regulated. When there's a public hearing on, say, implementing new rules for trading derivatives, most of the people who show up are the people who trade derivatives. And these people, who generally know the most about trading derivatives, can use their expertise to try to create rules that benefit themselves. In the high-school-/civics model, the insiders would be countered by smart, well-informed opponents who could argue for the public interest. But real life has nothing to do with high-school civics.
The challenges to the U.S. economy are obvious. Millions of people are unemployed, underemployed or giving up on finding work while nations like China, India, Brazil and South Africa are nimble and growing fast. Our best shot at creating a decent economy in the future will come from making it easier for workers to shift out of dying careers and into promising ones. Workers need to be able to experiment and to fail (quickly and often) until they find the real, valuable skills that customers will pay for. This will take years. And in order for them to do that, we need to start by making it easier to braid hair in Utah.
Deep thoughts this week:
1) Industries actually like being regulated.
1.5) A lot.
2) The U.S. really needs to make it easier to change careers, pronto.
3) And all roads lead through the regulators!

HEADLINE: Formula One Track, Nearing First Race, Gets Wary Embrace From Austin

BYLINE: By DAVE MONTGOMERY

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- Less than 15 miles from the state capitol, and just down the road from Wild Bubba's Wild Game Grill, Austin's next big thing is rising from a sprawling patch of rock, clay and shrubs.
The Circuit of the Americas will not only put Austin, the self-proclaimed live music capital of the world, in the company of Monte Carlo, Abu Dhabi, Shanghai and other international cities in the glamorous world of Formula One racing.
The track will also give Formula One a permanent presence as it once again tries to raise its profile in the United States, which last hosted a Formula One race in 2007. More than 120,000 spectators are expected for the inaugural race in November, for which three-day passes went on sale last Sunday. The next day, the two-time champion Sebastian Vettel went for a test drive on 3.2-mile road course in West New York and Weehawken, N.J., that will host a Formula One race in 2013. And this weekend in Austin, where the biggest sport is University of Texas football, the Formula Expo at the convention center aims to introduce fans to the basics of Formula One through interactive exhibits, racecar simulators, meetings with former drivers and show cars. 
To some in Austin, though, screaming racecars and hordes of international glitterati seem out of character in the home of outlaw country music, impassioned environmentalists and a counterculture rooted in the hippie heyday of the 1960s and '70s.
Keep Austin Weird adorns T-shirts, bumper stickers and barrooms. The popular mantra is observed so devoutly that after a homeless, cross-dressing peace activist named Leslie died in March, the City Council paid tribute with a moment of silence.
''I don't think this is a good fit for Austin to have an event that has supermodels dripping off the arms of playboy millionaires hanging out all over town,'' said the former City Council member and environmental leader Brigid Shea, who made Formula One subsidies an issue in her recent unsuccessful campaign against Mayor Lee Leffingwell, a supporter of the project. ''Most people in Austin don't think that's who we are. That's more Dallas or Houston.''
Austin long ago outgrew its image as a tranquil college town to become a fast-growing high-tech hub. More than 1.7 million people live in the metropolitan region that includes Austin, Round Rock and San Marcos.
The track is being built in southeast Travis County near Elroy, a ranching community of several hundred people on lots ranging up to 50 acres. Elroy has largely been bypassed by the growth that has developed other parts of the Austin metropolitan area, and its residents complain of inadequate services and the lack of basic conveniences like a supermarket or bus service.
But at Wild Bubba's Wild Game Grill, a half-mile from the track's main construction entrance, the proprietor Wyman Gilliam, a k a Wild Bubba, has decorated the restaurant with Formula One posters. He refers to Elroy as Speed City.
''It'll be the economic engine that gets southeast Travis County going,'' said Gilliam, who came close to moving his restaurant into Austin because of slumping business before plans for the track were announced in 2010.
Now he enjoys a brisk trade from construction crews and Formula One personnel while he awaits an influx of spectators. Gilliam and his father, Wyman Sr., plan to rent two renovated cabanas on their nearby farm to spectators for $400 per night.
Cathy Olive, a goat rancher who leads the Elroy Neighborhood Association, said the track was a far superior option to widely opposed earlier plans to use the once-vacant site for tract housing. But she acknowledged that some residents had contemplated moving because of the potential traffic and noise.
''We're very fractured out here about how we feel about it,'' she said. ''I'm just not sure one or two races a year will get us a Walmart.''
The $350 million Circuit of the Americas project has encountered its share of controversy, including a lawsuit between its principals, an earlier construction delay, and disputes about state and local subsidies. Circuit officials nevertheless say that work at the 1,100-acre site is on pace for completion this fall.
Veteran race fans will notice design elements reminiscent of other Formula One tracks as the course winds through 20 turns on hilly terrain with a view of downtown Austin. One signature feature is a 133-foot rise in elevation from the starting line to Turn 1. Speeds are expected to reach up to 200 miles per hour on the straightaway between Turns 11 and 12.
The man who brought Formula One to Texas is the Austin racing promoter Tavo Hellmund, a longtime friend of the Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone. Hellmund, a former racecar driver, once competed on European Formula 3 tracks with ''Visit Texas'' emblazoned on the side of his Dallara.
Hellmund, 46, said he spent years trying to convince Ecclestone that Austin would be an ideal stop for Formula One.
''At the time, Bernie just had this picture of Austin as being what all of us who have grown up in Austin have -- the sleepy, hippie college town,'' Hellmund said. ''I probably made over 20 trips to pitch him.''
After Ecclestone embraced the concept, Hellmund formed a partnership with Red McCombs, a San Antonio businessman and former professional sports franchise owner (San Antonio Spurs and Minnesota Vikings); and Bobby Epstein, an Austin developer who owned the land for the track site.
''I was asked by Tavo and Bobby if they could get an audience with me and I set aside an hour on a Saturday morning,'' McCombs said. ''And that hour turned out to be about two and a half and I realized from that conference there was a chance that we might be able to do something that would really be an international event. There wouldn't be anything similar to it.''
McCombs said that international and out-of-state visitors would find a ''very cosmopolitan atmosphere with a Western flavor'' in Austin and that such a world-class facility would bolster the state and regional economy by hosting events throughout the year. In addition to Formula One racing, the track is scheduled to host three days of Australian V-8 Supercar racing next year.
But lofty visions were clouded by hard feelings. Hellmund, who was pushed out of the project, sued Epstein and McCombs. The case was settled earlier this month, clearing another hurdle as the circuit gets ready for race day in less than six months.
The track recently announced a host committee of more than 50 central Texas community leaders and high-profile residents, including the golfer Ben Crenshaw and the chief executive of the Lance Armstrong Foundation, Doug Ulman.
Of the more than 115,000 requests for information received by late May, about 35 percent were from Texas, 60 percent were from elsewhere in the United States and about 5 percent were from other countries, primarily Mexico, Canada and western Europe, said Geoff Moore, the circuit's chief marketing and revenue officer.
Personal seat licenses, costing up to $5,500 and good for 15 years, are required for premier seating in the grandstand across from the starting line or at Turns 1 and 15. Three-day general admission grounds passes are $159, grandstand bleacher tickets range from $269 to $499, while a season ticket, which will cover the Formula One and Supercar races, costs $1,250.
Kevin Granger, a 41-year-old realtor, was in the Circuit of the Americas downtown sales offices recently to consider a block of seats to use to entertain clients and family members.
''I think it's going to be a very exciting sporting venue that Austin's never seen before,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Familiar Faces Offering Advice, Idealism and Humor

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA

 BODY:
Alongside the statesmen, tycoons and artists who addressed the class of 2012 at commencement exercises this spring, a popular choice of speakers seemed to be ''people we're used to seeing on television,'' offering a dose of comforting familiarity to young people headed into a parlous world.
Prospects looked bright when these graduates were filling out college applications, but they started classes the month Lehman Brothers disintegrated, financial markets panicked and everyone wondered whether 2008 would turn into 1929. They emerge to an anemic economic recovery, when even for those with a bachelor's degree, the unemployment rate is 4 percent, double what it was five years ago, and many more people can find only part-time work.
Brian Williams, Barbara Walters, Katie Couric, Oprah Winfrey, Fareed Zakaria, Bob Schieffer and Steve Carell, to name a few, had their turns dispensing wisdom. And like their perhaps somewhat less recognizable fellow speakers, they offered warnings of challenges ahead, and some gallows humor. 
''The world outside of Harvard has asked me to make a quick announcement,'' Andy Samberg, a ''Saturday Night Live'' cast member, said at that august institution. ''The following majors are apparently useless, as of tomorrow: history, literature, all things related to art, social studies, East Asian studies, pretty much anything that ends with studies, Romance languages and, finally, folklore and mythology.''
''Unless,'' he added, ''you can somehow turn them into an iPhone app. Math and science majors, you guys, are cool. Finally.''
But uplift and idealism still ruled. Graduates were exhorted to do great things, look out for others and maybe, just maybe, put aside their electronic devices for a few minutes. The nearest to universal advice was that graduates should chase what they love, and heal what ails humanity.
There was considerable talk of pre-college education, as speakers like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, Wendy Kopp of Teach for America and Geoffrey Canada of the Harlem Children's Zone appealed to people to devote themselves to the needs of children.
Clearly, composing a commencement address is a challenge, but certain conventions must be followed. So drawing on a sampling of this year's speeches, here is a template:
Why did they invite me?
BRIAN WILLIAMS, NBC NEWS ANCHOR
George Washington University
''I told them when they called, I said: 'You know, I dropped out of G.W. It was my third and final attempt at college.' And they said: 'Oh, no, that's cool. Come on ahead.' ''
PETER DINKLAGE, ACTOR
Bennington College
''Of all the novelists, teachers, playwrights, poets, groundbreaking visual artists and pioneers of science, you got the TV actor. (Applause) No. No. And I actually heard you petitioned for me. Oh, you fools. You know what? For those of you who didn't petition for me, I would love to later on talk about the problems in the Middle East and, you know, the downfall of the world economy. And for those of you who did petition for me, I don't have any signed DVDs of 'Game of Thrones.' But I'm happy to talk about the parallel lineages of the Targaryens and the Lannisters later, at the bar.''
ANDY SAMBERG, COMEDIAN
Harvard
''I am as honored to be here today as I am unqualified. There is a storied history of incredible Class Day speakers here at Harvard. Nobel Prize laureate Mother Teresa, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, and now me, the fake-rap, wiener-songs guy.''
Nobody will remember anything about this speech.
STEVE CARELL, ACTOR
Princeton University
''I think that we all can agree that most of these Class Day speeches are forgotten almost as soon as they are delivered. Witness Brooke Shields, Katie Couric and especially Stephen Colbert. He is the worst.''
BARNEY FRANK, CONGRESSMAN
Harvard
''It's like singing 'The Star-Spangled Banner' at the World Series. Nobody came to hear you. But it's not an official event unless you do it. And the only time anybody will remember you is if you screw it up real bad. So I hope not to be too memorable on this occasion.''
Let me tell you an embarrassing personal story.
IRA GLASS, RADIO HOST
Goucher College
''I lost my virginity in one of the dorms here. Not recently.''
MR. DINKLAGE ''I was 4-foot-something. I mumbled when I spoke. I wore a sort of woman's black velvet cape, black tights, combat boots and a scowl.''
MR. CARELL ''When I was in college, I wouldn't 'text' a girl to ask her out on a date. I would ask her, in person. One human being to another. And when she said no, which she always did, I would suffer the humiliation and self-loathing that a young man needs for his, or her, personal growth.''
Do what moves you. Stick with it through adversity.
SALMAN KHAN, FOUNDER, KHAN ACADEMY
Rice University
''When I was almost at the lowest point and I was frankly about to give up, I got the biggest act of validation, or one in a series, really. I had a little link on the Web site, where people were donating $5, $10, and then all of a sudden a $10,000 donation comes in. And it was from someone named Ann Doerr, who I later learned was Rice, class of 1975. ... Obviously the money was a big deal. ... But the real power of what Ann did was that act of empowerment, that act of validation.''
CONDOLEEZZA RICE,
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE
Southern Methodist University
''Find and follow your passion. Now, I don't mean just any old thing that interests you, or your career. I mean something you really believe is a unique calling to you -- in other words, something that you can't live without. ... Fortunately, I wandered into a course in international politics taught by a Soviet specialist, a man named Josef Korbel who had a daughter named Madeleine Albright. And with that one class, I was hooked. I discovered that my passion was Russian -- things Russian, things international, diplomacy. Needless to say, this wasn't exactly what a young black girl from Birmingham was supposed to do, but it was like finding love. I couldn't explain it, but I knew it was right.''
NEIL GAIMAN, AUTHOR
University of the Arts
''Nothing I did where the only reason for doing it was the money was ever worth it, except as bitter experience. Usually I didn't wind up getting the money, either.''
Much in the world needs fixing.
GEOFFREY CANADA, HARLEM CHILDREN'S ZONE
University of Pennsylvania
''You are graduating at a time when our country is desperate for highly educated women and men who will fight to see through the veils of pure self-interest and half-truths. ... The poor fill our jails and prisons. They stumble into our emergency rooms, wheezing, limping, with blood leaking from holes never intended by God or nature. They sit in waiting rooms hoping for a sympathetic ear, which can stave off homelessness, for another month, another week, another night. They stand on lines for food, or clothes, or whatever is being given away for free. Those who are poor in this country have the weight of poverty, violence and lack of education hanging over their heads, straining to break free and crush them, maybe kill them. And when this weight crashes down, you will not be under it. ... My question to you is, do you care about those who won't make it without real help? You have been at Penn preparing to enter the big game of life, and I have a most wondrous proposition for you. Come join our team. We're losing. Yes, that's right, we're losing.''
ROBERT M. GATES, FORMER DEFENSE SECRETARY
University of Texas, Austin
''The obligations of citizenship in any democracy are considerable, but they are even more profound and more demanding for a nation with America's domestic problems and international obligations. ... Consider spending at least a part of your life in public service.''
MS. RICE ''You have been taught to serve those who are less fortunate. And yes, it will help them, but it will help you more. When you encounter those who are less fortunate, you cannot possibly give way to aggrievement -- 'Why do I not have?' -- or its twin brother, entitlement -- 'Why don't they give me?' In fact, you will ask instead not 'Why do I not have?' but 'Why have I been given so much?' ''
LAWRENCE LESSIG, LEGAL SCHOLAR
John Marshall Law School in Atlanta
''There is no one in the criminal justice system who believes that system works well. There is no one in housing law who believes this is what law was meant to be. ... The law of real people doesn't work, even if the law of corporations does. ... The law has convinced most Americans that the law is for the rich, except that part of the law that involves the prisons. We, all of us, have a duty to fix this. To repair this. To make it better.''
CORY A. BOOKER, MAYOR OF NEWARK
Bard College
''Go out there and swear to this world your oath, not with your words, but with what you do. Not with your hand over your heart, but with your hand outstretched to a world that desperately needs your hand, your help, your insights, your creativity, your honor, your courage. It needs you.''
MR. WILLIAMS ''How many of you have worked in politics during your time at the George Washington University? All right. Keep that up. My only advice would be get along, please. ... Remember, there would be no Constitution in this country without compromise. ... How many of you plan to be educators? Thank you for that. How many of you spent some time overseas helping impoverished people? How many of you plan to keep at that work? ... I've walked through countries like Malawi, where the difference between a small community with running water coming out of a one-inch white PVC pipe and a town without water is often just which towns have been visited by terrific young American people acting as volunteers.''
Have a little humility.
MICHAEL LEWIS, AUTHOR
Princeton University
''People really don't like to hear success explained away as luck, especially successful people. As they age, and succeed, people feel their success was somehow inevitable. They don't want to acknowledge the role played by accident in their lives. ... Recognize that if you have had success, you have also had luck, and with luck comes obligation. You owe a debt, and not just to your gods. You owe a debt to the unlucky.''
MR. BOOKER ''My dad would always tease me: 'Boy, don't you walk around here like you hit a triple. You were born on third base, boy.' ... I drink deeply from wells of freedom and liberty that I did not dig. I eat lavishly from banquet tables prepared for me by my ancestors. I sit under the shade of trees that were planted and cultivated and cared for by those who I will never know.''
MS. RICE ''At those times when you're absolutely sure that you're right, talk with someone who disagrees. And if you constantly find yourself in the company of those who say 'amen' to everything that you say, find other company.''
Life will be hard, as it should be. That is how you learn.
AARON SORKIN, WRITER AND PRODUCER
Syracuse University
''To get where you're going, you have to be good, and to be good where you're going, you have to be damned good. Every once in a while, you'll succeed. Most of the time you'll fail, and most of the time the circumstances will be well beyond your control.''
MR. DINKLAGE ''My parents didn't have much money, but they struggled to send me to the best schools. And one of the most important things they did for me -- and graduates, maybe you don't want to hear this -- is that once I graduated, I was on my own. Financially, it was my turn. Parents are applauding, graduates are not. But this made me very hungry. Literally. I couldn't be lazy. Now I'm totally lazy, but back then, I couldn't be.''
MR. GAIMAN ''Things go wrong, in life and in love and in business and in friendship and in health and in all the other ways that life can go wrong. And when things get tough, this is what you should do: make good art. I'm serious. Husband runs off with a politician? Make good art. Leg crushed and then eaten by mutated boa constrictor? Make good art. I.R.S. on your trail? Make good art. Cat exploded? Make good art. Somebody on the Internet thinks what you do is stupid or evil, or it's all been done before? Make good art.''
Be willing to make mistakes.
ATUL GAWANDE, PHYSICIAN AND AUTHOR
Williams College
''There continue to be huge differences between hospitals in the outcomes of their care. ... I thought that the best places simply did a better job at controlling and minimizing risks, that they did a better job of preventing things from going wrong. But to my surprise, they didn't. Their complication rates after surgery were almost the same as others. Instead, what they proved to be really great at was rescuing people when they had a complication, preventing failures from becoming a catastrophe. ... They call them a 'Failure to Rescue.' More than anything, this is what distinguished the great from the mediocre. They didn't fail less. They rescued more. This in fact may be the real story of human and societal improvement. Risk is necessary.''
MR. SORKIN ''Make no mistake about it, you are dumb. You're a group of incredibly well-educated dumb people. I was there. We all were there. You're barely functional. There are some screw-ups headed your way. I wish I could tell you that there was a trick to avoiding the screw-ups, but the screw-ups, they're a-coming for ya.''
MR. BOOKER ''I believe in my heart of hearts that it is better to have your ship sunk at sea than have it rot in the harbor.''
MR. DINKLAGE ''Don't bother telling the world you are ready. Show it. Do it. What did Beckett say? 'Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.' ''
You can make the world better.
MR. SORKIN ''You're too good for schadenfreude, you're too good for gossip and snark, you're too good for intolerance -- and since you're walking into the middle of a presidential election, it's worth mentioning that you're too good to think people who disagree with you are your enemy.''
MR. LEWIS ''I was almost certainly less prepared for the marketplace than most of you. Yet somehow I have wound up rich and famous.''
MR. SAMBERG ''My advice to you is simple: Relax, dude. You just finished college at Harvard. ... I went to Santa Cruz, and then I transferred to film school, and I'm rich, O.K.? And I don't mean spiritually rich or any hippie crap like that.''
ERIC SCHMIDT, GOOGLE EXECUTIVE CHAIRMAN
University of California, Berkeley
''You are the emblems of the sense of possibility that will define our new age. Now, in the past, it's always older generations standing up on high, trying to teach the next generation the ways of the world, trying to make sure they follow in their footsteps. Well, graduates, I'll admit, I think it's different today. You're quite simply teaching us.''
MR. GLASS ''Grandma Frieda, Goucher grad, Baltimore girl, met Adolf Hitler.'' Decades later, when she would tell the story to her high school students, they would all ask, '' 'Why didn't you kill him?' And she said: 'If I'd known what he was going to do. It was 1932.' And right there is the problem. We don't know. We lurch forward in our lives, we try this, we try that, we make the best guesses that we can, based on what we believe at the time. And it is entirely possible that a Goucher grad -- that you, or you, or you -- will get the chance to change the world and kill Adolf Hitler, and you will miss it. That is entirely possible. But ... when you get your chance to remake the world, when you get the chance to change everything for yourself and hopefully for others, too, when you get your chance to shoot Adolf Hitler, you will know what to do.''

HEADLINE: The Road Not Taken

BYLINE: By GARY HART. 
Gary Hart, the president of Hart International, is a former senator from Colorado. He sought the Democratic nomination for president in 1984 and 1988 and was a chairman of the Commission on National Security/21st Century. This is an excerpt from an essay at nytimes.com/ campaignstops.

 BODY:
For more than four decades most Americans identified the Democratic Party with a social contract and safety net, equality of justice and opportunity, and progressive -- yes, even liberal -- causes. Sometime in the last 30 years the party of progress and change -- Emerson's ''party of hope'' -- became the party of reactionary liberalism. 
The 1970s brought revolutions: globalization and foreign competition; the decline of the manufacturing base; petroleum-producing nations controlling the price of oil; and the unsustainable costs of cold war military deployments.
The Democratic Party during this period had the opportunity to develop a new economic platform but failed to do so. Having no constructive responses to these economic and social revolutions, it clung to the defense of its historic social agenda, which required taxation of working-class and middle-income people to finance that agenda, at a time when their own economic security was endangered.
The Democratic response of triangulation and centrism, essentially splitting the difference between reactionary liberalism and increasingly virulent conservatism, cost the party its identity. A few political figures of my generation, essentially those swept into office by the post-Watergate tidal wave in the mid-1970s, began to fashion an alternative, comprehensive, long-range agenda built around the managed transition of the economic base of the United States from traditional manufacturing to information and communications.
This involved transforming our steel and auto industry into plants that produced high-value products at which we could excel; combining a package of tax incentives, advanced scientific research investments, computer education, worker-training programs and information highway acceleration; and developing competitive free trade initiatives (as opposed to the protectionist measures that sought, Canute-like, to hold back the tide of globalization) that would help us maintain a lead in the emerging worlds of sciences and technologies.
This economic transformation policy came to be combined in my case with a new foreign policy approach I called ''enlightened engagement'' and a post-cold-war defense policy based upon carefully detailed military reforms that anticipated the coming transformation of war and the rise of irregular, unconventional conflict. These initiatives were the answer to the clever debate taunt ''Where's the beef?'' But they also resisted media insistence on sound-bite compression.
The principal theory of those of my generation who believed every bit as strongly in the social contract and care for the needy as the most ardent New Dealer was that the economic pie must continue to grow to generate the revenues required to finance that contract. To argue that taxes on the working middle class must continue even as incomes contracted is to virtually guarantee a revival of conservatism and anti-government sentiments of the kind that now characterize our politics.
By failing to innovate some 30 years ago, the party of hope and compassion has permitted itself to lapse into the defensive, perhaps reactionary, posture that now plagues it. A well-motivated Democratic president struggles to move the nation forward against the conservative current that emerged in the policy vacuum created by Democratic failure to adapt and in a political climate where many people, especially young people, do not know the basic principles for which the current Democratic Party stands.

HEADLINE: One Crowd Rumbles; the Other Slumbers

BYLINE: By TONY GERVINO

 BODY:
A few short years ago, Oklahoma City was primarily known in basketball circles as the place where the former Knicks player John Starks had bagged groceries on his way to the N.B.A. Now, the city has a new calling card: an aural mayhem that its Thunder fans unleash on a nightly basis.
Sporting arenas and stadiums routinely proclaim themselves to be the world's loudest, but such statements come with an implied asterisk. Beyond silly scoreboard graphics featuring wobbly meters and whatnot, no one has actually kept score. (I know because I checked.) Oklahoma City's home, the Chesapeake Energy Arena, may be the latest to ascend the imaginary throne. Din is too small a word to describe the in-game fan soundtrack. As it turns out, thunder, appropriately, comes closest.
Thursday night's game, a heartbreaking 100-96 defeat at the hands of the Miami Heat, was no different. Even when the Heat had built a commanding 17-point first-quarter lead, and seemed to put the Thunder back on their heels, Oklahoma City fans stubbornly refused to yield control of the decibel level, sounding like Metallica performing in a Smart Car. To an observer it seemed as if the crowd had willed the furious second-half comeback, the second in two finals games. 
There were scant Heat fans in attendance Thursday to root their team on -- the lack of direct flights between the two cities doesn't help -- and a cursory check of ticket reseller Stubhub.com a few days before the game revealed something telling: there have typically been triple the number of seats available for Miami's home games than those in Oklahoma City. In short, Thunder fans aren't selling, they're just yelling.
Now the series shifts to Miami for Game 3 on Sunday, and casual viewers can wait to see if Heat fans can or will return fire. If ''can or will'' sounds tepid, it is meant to.
Like many hard-core b-ball fans, I never saw this coming. I assumed that the arrival of the Heatles (a nickname LeBron James unfortunately coined last season), replete with its fire-breathing stage show in October 2010, would give the South Beach fan base a shot of adrenaline that wouldn't soon wear off. It's embarrassing to say now, but I was afraid for the competitive balance of the league.
So when I proposed writing a weekly column following the newfangled Heat team for a popular culture Web site whose unofficial tagline is Be Less Stupid, I had what I thought was a foolproof pitch: It was just after the Decision by James and I was convinced that the Heat's 2011 season, and its subsequent campaigns, would play out like Led Zeppelin's United States tour in 1973, when the band shattered records for ticket sales and gripped the country by the throat, all while performing at a level of which mere mortals could only dream.
I assumed that, with social media and the team's regular appearances on TNT, ESPN and ABC as the fuel, and Miami's inherent draw -- sun, sand, night life -- visitors who may have seen them on tour would eventually rendezvous with Heat fans at the American Airlines Arena, building enough excitement to host the loudest and the greatest show on earth.
Instead, something else occurred, much to my surprise, chagrin and regret (in that order): the arena, despite boasting two of the N.B.A.'s greatest talents and a celebrity row filled with a small cadre of Southern rappers, hosted a circus and, as it turns out, a relatively tame one. The players were in duck-and-cover mode from the media glare and never really built the momentum needed to make Miami's arena one of the N.B.A.'s ''it'' destinations. While it is alternately Dwyane Wade or James who keeps the Heat's energy level high, the Thunder players' emotional fulcrum actually surrounds the court -- and therein lies the greatest difference between the teams. Oklahoma City fans shout, whistle and stamp their feet. They chant ''O.K.C., O.K.C.'' long before the game begins and ends. Perhaps it's the hunger felt after years of pining for a professional sports team. Or just maybe they think they can rattle a Heat squad that posted a record of 18-15 on the road this season, which is four more road wins than the Knicks had.
After Thursday's big win, many of the Heat players, while still sweating after withstanding the Thunder comeback, said all the requisite things about how they were excited to head home for the next three games, to sleep in their beds and play in their house, as James told the ABC sideline reporter Doris Burke after the game. Miami was 28-5 at home in the regular season. In the playoffs, its record stands at a robust 9-2. One could argue that the Heat elevate their play in spite of their supporters, not because of them.
Last season, an oft-ridiculed e-mail went out from the team to season-ticket holders during the finals, fresh on the heels of Charles Barkley's assessment on ESPN radio that Miami has ''the worst fans.'' He added: ''No question. It's not even loud in there.'' The e-mail message from the team asked for a show of team spirit and contained some rudimentary advice on being a fan, such as ''wear comfortable shoes'' and to be prepared to ''call in sick for Monday,'' ending with: ''Doors open at 6. See you at 5.''
So what is it about Miami's arena that fails to strike fear in the hearts of opponents? Sunday's game should clue you in. Many of the fans closest to the courtside action have a different makeup -- older, quieter, both arriving later and departing earlier -- than in most other N.B.A. arenas. If the team falls behind, they aren't quick to implore them. There is no deafening roar, no prolonged standing ovations, comfortable shoes or not. Jokes about early-bird suppers and fourth-quarter wake-up calls aside, the crowd looks like South Florida, only not the one on popular TV shows (save for ''The Golden Girls'').
While a walk-through of the upper-tier sections revealed a slightly different demographic makeup -- calling them cheap seats would be a stretch -- in the made-for-TV world in which professional sports leagues operate, the first dozen rows tell the story. And the story, in Miami, isn't intimidating.
Miamians would point to myriad other reasons for the arena's collective lack of energy: that Miami has more distractions than other N.B.A. cities; that the team is trying to sell unreasonably high-priced tickets in a depressed local economy, which keeps the younger, rowdier element on their couches; and that traffic and suspect public transport make it difficult to get into their seats before tipoff.
Whatever the case, Sunday is Miami's first best chance to show Thunder fans that they too can bring the noise. The question remains: Will they be on time?

HEADLINE: Shannon Schissler, Andrew Baker

BYLINE: By VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

 BODY:
Shannon Miriam Schissler and Maj. Andrew John Baker were married Saturday at the Cadet Chapel at West Point in West Point, N.Y. The Rev. Todd A. Cheney, a Baptist Army chaplain, performed the ceremony. 
The bride, 30, is a foreign service officer for the United States Agency for International Development in La Paz, Bolivia. She designs and implements projects with Bolivian counterparts to address development issues in areas related to democracy and governance, economic growth and health. She graduated from Bucknell University and received a master's degree in international administration from the University of Miami.
She is the daughter of Susan M. Schissler of Clark, N.J., and the late Roger A. Schissler.
The bridegroom, 35, is a United States Army engineer officer who will begin serving next month with the 27th Engineer Battalion at Fort Bragg, N.C. He graduated from West Point and received two master's degrees: one in civil engineering from the University of Virginia and the other in engineering management from the University of Missouri at Rolla.
He is a son of Lynn S. Baker and John E. Baker of Burke, Va.
The couple met in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, in July 2009 at a party hosted by a mutual friend about a week after the Honduran military forcibly removed President Manuel Zelaya.
Ms. Schissler, a longtime Honduras resident, was working in Tegucigalpa for agency for international development as a Peace Corps intern after a two-and-a-half-year tour as a Peace Corps volunteer. Major Baker was new to Honduras, having recently begun a six-month tour based in Tegucigalpa managing projects for the Army Corps of Engineers throughout Central America.
That night, Ms. Schissler and Major Baker bonded over tacos and beer, their conversation jumping from the political unrest in Honduras to their careers to their love of travel to their love of dogs.
''At first, we talked quite a bit about humanitarian assistance and building infrastructure,'' Major Baker recalled. ''But what really got me interested in her was the fact that she was doing this selfless job so far from home. She had a passion for helping other people. That was very impressive to me.''
Major Baker then asked Ms. Schissler if she would like to go hiking the next day. She accepted, and they began seeing each other exclusively.
''I could have never imagined meeting my future wife in that kind of environment,'' Major Baker said. VINCENT M. MALLOZZI

HEADLINE: The Day When Europe Holds Its Breath

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
IT will be a late Sunday night for financial pros like Markus Krygier. In New York, London, Tokyo and beyond, nearly everyone is focused on one thing right now: Greece. To be precise, they are focused on a ''Grexit'' -- the possibility of the country's eventual exit from the euro. For many, the prospect has moved from ''if'' to ''when.''
The Greek elections on Sunday will chart the immediate course, one way or another, and investors like Mr. Krygier, a money manager in London, will be standing by to size up the results. On this side of the Atlantic, BlackBerries and iPhones will be at the ready during Father's Day barbecues.
Who will prevail in Athens? Will it be Syriza, a coalition of leftist groups that has declared that it will annul the terms of Greece's bailout? Or the center-right New Democracy, which says it will stick with austerity and keep Greece in the euro zone? 
For the euro itself, it may not really matter much, at least in the medium term, says Mr. Krygier, who oversees $20 billion. He is betting that the euro, the currency of 17 nations from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, will eventually weaken, whatever the outcome on Sunday.
Mr. Krygier works for Amundi, a money management venture of two big French banks. And, like many others in the financial world, he says the euro will lose more value against the dollar. Even a euro-friendly election in Athens wouldn't be enough to stem the pressure as long as nervous investors look to the dollar as a haven, he says. All the bailouts in Europe -- two so far for Greece alone -- have done little to contain the problems. The financial markets savaged Greece but have now moved on to bigger targets like Spain and Italy.
''The hundred billion bought us two hours of relief, and then interest rates began to go up again and markets began to zoom in on Italy,'' Mr. Krygier says, referring to last weekend's 100 billion euro bailout for Spanish banks. ''It has become a systemic issue. Until we see a lasting resolution of those doubts, we feel the euro will remain under pressure.''
On that point, many professional investors and traders agree. The euro has weakened steadily as Europe's economic crisis has worsened. In May 2011, the euro was trading at about $1.50. Late Friday in New York, it was at $1.26, near a two-year low. But the big money says the euro will weaken even more. Traders have wagered more than $30 billion against it, according to data from the federal Commodity Futures Trading Commission. That figure, which represents so-called short sales, is close to a record high.
''This short position is unprecedented in terms of size,'' said Robert Sinche, global head of currency strategy at RBS Securities in Stamford, Conn. ''There are a lot of people with some very negative scenarios out there, and they've all acted.''
It's worth remembering that the euro has been weaker than this before -- a lot weaker. After euro notes and coins went into circulation on Jan. 1, 2002, the currency promptly sank to about 86 cents. By 2008, however, it had rebounded as high as $1.60.
As forecasts go, Mr. Krygier's isn't nearly as bleak as some. He doesn't expect a wholesale breakup of the euro zone, which has gone from being a far-fetched idea two years ago to a much-talked-about fear today. He says he thinks that Europe will ultimately get its act together and save the euro.
''The question,'' he says, ''is how long it will take and how much pain there is before we get there.''
If the left-wing parties win in Greece and back away from austerity, prompting a default or a disorderly exit from the euro, ''we would expect the euro to drop like a stone,'' he says. ''The consequences would be dramatic.'' The currency could sink to parity with the dollar, he says.
Mr. Krygier has been negative on the euro for more than two years, but his sentiment darkened this spring, as the focus of the fears moved from Greece to bigger countries.
''The big turning point was the transition from a crisis involving Greece and the smaller countries to a crisis that could engulf Italy and Spain,'' he says. ''It became much more existential for the euro zone itself. We clearly saw at that stage that the vulnerability had increased further.''
Mr. Krygier also expects the euro to decline against the British pound and Scandinavian currencies. And for all the recent doubts about the strength of the economic recovery in the United States, the dollar remains the pre-eminent refuge for foreign investors.
''The U.S. economy is still seen as a safe haven because of the depth of its financial markets, and it's also sufficiently removed from the epicenter in Europe,'' he says.
To be sure, Mr. Krygier says, a victory by those who stand behind austerity could produce a quick snapback in the euro's value against the dollar. But even if that happened, it probably wouldn't last, he says. ''You might see a short-lived recovery, but in the medium term, the euro has to be weaker.''
And so Mr. Krygier, like just about everyone else in the financial world, will be waiting things out on Sunday. First, he plans to watch the European soccer championships. (Germany, which has prescribed austerity to save the euro, is playing Denmark, which opted out of the common currency and still uses the krone.) Then he will stay up as the first election results come in.
Whatever happens in Athens, doubts about Spain and Italy will only continue to grow, Mr. Krygier predicts. Those nations' debt loads are large, and both are increasingly seen as unable to make the kind of changes that will persuade investors to keep buying their debt.
THE ultimate answer, Mr. Krygier says, is for European governments, led by his native Germany, to agree ''on concrete and credible steps toward greater fiscal and political integration,'' including the issuance of broader euro zone debt. That would eventually allow Spain and Italy to borrow what they need with Continentwide backing. In addition, he says, leaders should come up with a euro zonewide bank guarantee to avert full-scale bank runs in shaky countries.
Ultimately, Mr. Krygier says, the market will force policy makers' hands. ''But with 17 parties sitting at the table, the decisions are glacial,'' he says. ''The markets move in a rapid-fire fashion. The stakes are increasing.''

HEADLINE: The Rush Of Hitting The Bull's-Eye

BYLINE: By ELISA MALA

 BODY:
BEGINNERS on an archery range are almost as easy to spot as the targets: just look for a mean black-and-blue patch where a bowstring has sliced against an incorrectly positioned bicep. Few injuries inspire such rapid correction of form.
There are many novice archers at Pro Line, an indoor range and supply store on a commercial stretch in Ozone Park, Queens. Reasonable fees -- $13 buys an adult day pass -- have long drawn would-be Robin Hoods to the lanes on the third floor of this squat, lemon-hued building. And archery has received a boost this year from ''The Hunger Games'' and its bow-slinging heroine, to say nothing of the marksmanship in ''The Avengers'' and the coming Pixar vehicle ''Brave.'' 
Olympic-style recurve bows, modern crossbows and intricately carved wooden hunting bows dangle from the ceiling. But otherwise the range is an ascetic backdrop for archery's bare necessities: a weapon, pencil-thin arrows pulled from a pouch on the hip and a gloriously fresh target waiting 5, 10 or the regulation 20 yards away. The sports drink here is drip coffee, 75 cents a cup by way of an honor system.
The sport allows little room for error: exhale a millisecond too soon and a minuscule shift, amplified over 60 feet, can doom an arrow that might have otherwise landed squarely on target.
''It's mechanical,'' explained Kevin Chu, 25, an unemployed writer from Queens who started popping by a month ago. ''You just have to shoot the same way every time.''
Pro Line is also a place for serious athletes to train. Joe McGlyn, one of the owners, recently placed 15th in the Olympic trials in men's archery, falling short of a spot on the team. Guy Gerig, another partner, is a former member of the United States national team. And Neil Kucich and Steve Miss, rounding out the mix, are dedicated amateurs who have been shooting for decades. The owners all have day jobs, so they work as a tag team to keep the range open for weeknight target and hunting leagues and on weekends for general recreation and occasional youth tournaments.
On a recent Saturday, the youngest archer was Ezra Hancock, 8. The oldest was Ed Gerig, 78, father to Mr. Gerig and grandfather to Valerie, 17, who started shooting when she was 4 and works part time at Pro Line.
''Age is not an issue,'' said Jacquelyne Coleman, 44, a Manhattan-based physical therapist who has brought her nephew, Chris Coleman, 14, and his trademark pink arrows to the range since he was a toddler.
If the archers had one thing in common, it was a desire to improve. For Steve Liu, 18, a senior at the Bronx High School of Science, the sport's appeal was ''the pure satisfaction of seeing results,'' he said. ''When you run, it takes months to get faster.''
For others, the rewards extend beyond athletics. Jack Lipton, 56, and his daughter, Sara, 11 -- who were training with matching patches over their left eyes -- came to Pro Line after she started shooting suction cups in her bedroom. Off the range, Sara, an aspiring actress, is accustomed to auditioning for elusive parts. ''In archery, there is no rejection,'' she said.
Someday, knowing her way around a bow might even prove to be an asset: Mr. Gerig trained Zoe Saldana for her role in ''Avatar,'' while Mr. McGlyn has completed training Robert De Niro for a role in ''Killing Season,'' scheduled for release next year.
And for those who set their sights beyond shooting for appearance's sake, Mr. Gerig offered sage advice for the spiritual journey: ''You decide how good you want to be, and we'll get you there.''

HEADLINE: Yes, Wall Street Can Reach Out

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
WITH unemployment just above 8 percent, it's clear that finding a job is tough for many Americans. But for war veterans, particularly disabled ones, it's even tougher. Nearly one of every three young male veterans was out of work last year.
This is a story about one small financial business that is trying to change that. It is called Drexel Hamilton, and in the take-the-money-and-run world of Wall Street, this firm is giving back.
Drexel Hamilton, an institutional brokerage firm with offices in Manhattan and Philadelphia, prepares disabled veterans for careers in finance. Twenty percent of its expenses go toward housing, educating and training such veterans. Once they pass regulatory exams, they interview for jobs at financial institutions. Those who can't find work suited to their abilities are hired by Drexel Hamilton.
The idea of creating a firm owned and operated by wounded veterans began with Lawrence K. Doll, a former home builder and commercial real estate executive. A disabled veteran himself -- he received two Purple Hearts and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry for his years in the Marine Corps in Vietnam -- he still has shrapnel in both legs. 
Mr. Doll, 62, started Drexel Hamilton in 2007, with his own money. Today the firm, which serves institutional clients like pension funds and hedge funds, has $3.2 million in assets, six offices across the country and 35 employees. Nine of them were wounded while serving in the military. Three interns working there this summer are also disabled vets.
Eric Eberth, 34, is one of the firm's full-time employees. While serving as an Apache Longbow helicopter pilot in the Army in Iraq, Mr. Eberth experienced traumatic brain injury. He was honorably discharged in December 2008. Now he is working in Drexel Hamilton's public finance unit, which underwrites and sells municipal bonds.
To help recruits learn the business, Drexel Hamilton apprentices them to securities industry professionals with decades of experience. Mr. Eberth, for example, works with Thomas Mead, a former public finance executive who spent years at Salomon Brothers.
Ben Downing, 38, a former Army staff sergeant in Iraq, works in Drexel Hamilton's capital markets unit. He is paired with Roger Elsas, a former executive at Lehman Brothers and Oppenheimer. Born in Brooklyn, Mr. Downing went into active duty directly out of high school. ''Access to a career in finance wasn't available to me,'' he told me.
SINCE it began its training program, Drexel Hamilton has prepared 30 wounded veterans for executive finance positions. Twenty-one have been hired by banks or brokerage firms, among them JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup.
Mr. Doll is also co-founder of the Wall Street Warfighters Foundation, a nonprofit group that finds candidates for banking careers and subsidizes a portion of their training at Drexel Hamilton. Donations from institutions and individuals pay for the costs not covered by Drexel.
''The goal for Wall Street Warfighters is to train 24 disabled veterans a year,'' Mr. Doll said. ''We don't intend for all of them to work on Wall Street. If they're in Omaha, they might work in a community bank.''
To be eligible for the program, veterans must pass background checks, have completed their military obligations and received an honorable discharge. They must also demonstrate an interest in finance.
Peter Pace, a retired four-star general in the Marine Corps, is a co-founder and chairman of the charity. Foundation officials travel to military hospitals to interview candidates. Once in the program, trainees spend six months in Drexel Hamilton's Philadelphia office, studying for regulatory exams and learning finance basics.
James W. Cahill, 74, is the firm's president. A former executive at Salomon Brothers, he came out of retirement to rebuild Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a securities firm, after it was decimated in the 2001 World Trade Center attacks. His son Tom, a broker at Cantor Fitzgerald, died in the north tower.
Mr. Cahill retired from Keefe, Bruyette in early 2008 but agreed to return to work when he heard about Drexel Hamilton. ''The conflicts overseas are winding down,'' he said. ''These are our peers, and now they're back. It's our responsibility to help them find their way in civilian life.''
Last year, 633,000 veterans of the second Gulf War era -- one in four of the veterans from this period -- reported having a service-related disability, according to the Labor Department. Only 80 percent of these disabled veterans were in the labor force as of August 2011, when the Labor Department collected the data.
Michael Steigerwald, 49, a decorated former Air Force pilot, works in sales at Drexel Hamilton with his former navigator, Fred Phelan, 42. Their plane took a direct hit from a rocket attack in Iraq. ''We spent a lot of time in conflict management leading good people into difficult situations,'' Mr. Steigerwald said. ''Wall Street is not that different for us.''
In several states and cities, Drexel Hamilton has received the same status assigned to financial firms run by women, African-Americans or Latinos. This means that the firm is among those that can compete for a specified portion of business awarded by the state or city. Delaware, Florida and Virginia designate Drexel Hamilton as a minority-owned firm for contracting business, as does Cook County, Ill., and Grand Rapids, Mich.
The New York State Senate has passed legislation that would put firms owned by service-disabled veterans on an equal footing with minority-owned firms. The State Assembly is weighing its own bill that would ''provide service-connected disabled veteran-owned businesses and veteran-owned businesses with increased opportunities in state contracting.''
Even without the designation, Drexel Hamilton has successfully competed with far larger and more established firms for business in New York. The firm is financial adviser to the New York City Municipal Water Finance Authority, for example. And Drexel has been co-manager of equity or debt offerings this year for some of the nation's largest financial institutions as well as Pepsico, the American International Group, Kroger and the Southern Company.
CAULDON D. QUINN, 39, is a disabled Navy veteran who served in Afghanistan and Pakistan. He started on Drexel Hamilton's stock trading desk in early 2010 and is now chief financial officer.
The firm has been able to grow during a challenging time for the securities industry, and not just because it does a good job of advising clients and executing trades for them, Mr. Quinn said. Customers know that when they do business with the firm, more veterans can be trained for a productive civilian life.
''If a customer gives us a fraction of their business,'' he said, ''the benefit to a firm like ours is to improve the lives of men and women who have served their country.''
In Wall Street parlance, that's a pretty good trade.

HEADLINE: What Would Keynes Do?

END THIS DEPRESSION NOW!
By Paul Krugman
259 pp. W. W. Norton & Company. $24.95.
Nearly four years on from the financial meltdown that plunged it into recession, the global economy remains fragile. The latest green shoots of recovery in the United States already show signs of turning brown. It is touch and go whether Barack Obama will enter the polls with unemployment above or below the 8 percent rate that usually means defeat for an incumbent president. Across the Atlantic, the euro zone stumbles from crisis to crisis; the continuing problems of the heavily indebted PIIGS (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain) remain the basis for many a nightmare, some of the worst involving the banks around the world that own much of the debt. 
If ever there was a moment for fresh thinking, this is surely it. Indeed, Paul Krugman argues in ''End This Depression Now!,'' without a radical change in economic policy in both the United States and Europe, the likeliest outcome is a prolonged depression, perhaps not as ''great'' as in the 1930s but with clear similarities, above all in the immense human cost of needlessly high unemployment. As Krugman sees it, fiscal austerity, a fashionable idea on both sides of the Atlantic, can only make matters worse. This new ''austerian'' conventional wisdom, Krugman says, has ''completely thrown away Keynes's central dictum: 'The boom, not the slump, is the time for austerity.' ''
Not surprisingly, as today's leading interpreter of John Maynard Keynes, Krugman uses Keynes's definition of a depression, ''a chronic condition of subnormal activity for a considerable period without any marked tendency either towards recovery or towards collapse.'' He attributes this to a classic Keynesian ''liquidity trap,'' in which an indebted private sector is so intent on rebuilding its savings that even interest rates of zero cannot tempt it to borrow and spend enough to get the economy working again at full capacity. And he offers the classic Keynesian remedy of the government making up for the lack of private spending by splashing the cash around itself. Even now, Krugman argues, full employment could be restored to the United States in less than two years, given the political will to spend a lot of money.
How much money? Ideally, enough to generate inflation of 4 percent a year, Krugman says, breaking another of today's economic taboos by arguing that a bit of inflation would be good for us. He is particularly dismissive of the fact that the ''Germans hate, hate, hate'' inflation, owing to memories of the great inflation of the 1920s; in fact it was the deflationary policies of the 1930s, he tells us, that ''actually set the stage for the rise of you-know-who.'' One of the advantages of inflation cited by Krugman is that it reduces the real value of all that depression-inducing debt, like the mortgages people use to buy homes. On today's current low inflation trend, Krugman anticipates prices being 8 percent higher in 2017 than today. But, he says, ''if we could manage 4 or 5 percent inflation over that stretch, so that prices were 25 percent higher, the real value of mortgage debt would be substantially lower than it looks on current prospect -- and the economy would therefore be substantially farther along the road to sustained recovery.''
Longtime readers of Krugman will know there are at least two of him. One is the gifted winner of the Nobel in economic science, respected throughout the academy for his mastery of the dismal science; the other, the populist polemicist and baiter of the right who writes columns in The New York Times. ''End This Depression Now!'' is a collaborative effort by the two Krugmen. Professor Krugman usefully contributes plenty of mainstream economics in support of his stimulus plan and in order to debunk the idea that austerity policies in today's circumstances can boost an economy by increasing confidence. (As he points out, Britain, the leading country to embrace austerity voluntarily, is hardly setting the world on fire.) Yet no opportunity to preach to the choir is missed by the populist Mr. Krugman, nor any chance to mock those he calls the ''Very Serious People'' who disagree with him. This is often entertaining: during a stern speech in 2010 by Germany's finance minister, Krugman's wife dismissed those who regard austerity as a sort of moral purification with the whispered aside, ''As we leave the room, we'll be given whips to scourge ourselves.'' But the book's preachiness gives those politicians and economists who most need to read this book an easy excuse to ignore it.
To this Moderately Serious Reviewer, Krugman's habit of bashing anyone who does not share his conclusions is not merely stylistically irritating; it is flawed in substance. The rise in unemployment may be largely the result of inadequate demand, but that does not mean there has been no contribution from structural changes like the substitution of cheap foreign workers and innovative technology for some jobs in rich countries. The austerians may be excessively fearful of so-called ''bond vigilantes,'' but that does not mean there is no need to worry about what investors think about the health of a government's finances. Sure, ridicule those fundamentalists who believe it is theoretically impossible for an economy ever to suffer a shortage of demand, but does Krugman really need to take passing shots at Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, the chairmen of the widely respected bipartisan Bowles-Simpson Commission on deficit reduction appointed by President Obama? Maybe his case for stimulating the economy in the short run would be taken more seriously by those in power if it were offered along with a Bowles-/Simpson-style plan for improving America's finances in the medium or long term. Instead, Krugman suggests cavalierly that any extra government borrowing probably ''won't have to be paid off quickly, or indeed at all.''
Krugman seems to have given up on directly influencing policy makers and mainstream economists, opting instead to appeal over their heads to ''an informed public.'' Perhaps this makes sense. If his arguments win in the end, it may well be because, ultimately, the public does not have the stomach for prolonged austerity (perhaps after experimenting with it first by, say, electing a President Romney), and politicians will conclude that borrowing and inflating the debt away is a lot more palatable than cutting public spending and/or raising taxes.
Whether that would be as marvelous as Krugman says is debatable. Inflation imposes real costs, for instance on retired baby boomers reliant on fixed dollar annuities and on foreign investors in government bonds. How those bondholders would respond is anyone's guess, though they might shift away from the dollar or euro to other currencies or to alternatives like gold. Inflation would certainly increase the risk of the dollar losing its status as the world's reserve currency, with potentially serious political consequences like competitive devaluations, accusations of currency manipulation, trade wars and maybe worse (as Krugman, an expert in the economics of trade, well knows). In wanting to give top priority to helping the unemployed, Krugman's heart is clearly in the right place. Yet it would have made for a better book if he had offered a fuller discussion of the potential consequences of his policies, rather than evading it by citing Keynes's famous observation that ''in the long run we are all dead.''

HEADLINE: Prince Hal, You're Keeping Bad Company

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SOMMERS

 BODY:
Some 400 years before television audiences were riveted by the medieval struggles in ''Game of Thrones,'' William Shakespeare entertained Elizabethans with his Wars of the Roses cycle. These eight history plays imaginatively dramatize troubled English kings and their heirs during the 15th century, when the Plantagenet dynasty degenerated into the clashing houses of Lancaster and York.
Packed with battles, intrigue, compelling characters and memorable wordplay, the dramas were big hits in Shakespeare's time, and retain their potential to resonate today. 
The Shakespeare Theater of New Jersey in Madison presents a handsome staging of the second work in this cycle, ''Henry IV, Part 1,'' as the opening production of its 50th season.
In spite of its title, the story centers less upon King Henry IV (Brent Harris), uneasily wearing the crown he recently usurped from a cousin, and more on his slacker of a son, Prince Hal (Derek Wilson). As the king contends with a brewing rebellion, Hal eventually reforms himself from a hard-partying scamp into a steadfast soldier.
History is bound up tightly with family ties in this play, which studies father-son relationships.
Shakespeare contrasts Hal's awkward interactions with the disapproving Henry against Hal's jollier times carousing with Sir John Falstaff (John Ahlin), a disreputable old knight who has become his surrogate father. Yet another contrasting figure in this parental dynamic is gallant Henry Percy (Jon Barker), who is renowned far and wide as Hotspur, the temperamental scion of the rebellious Percy clan.
King Henry frankly admires Hotspur and wishes his son Hal were so noble, but Shakespeare later discloses that Hotspur's kinship with his crafty father, the Earl of Northumberland (Glenn Beatty), and icy uncle, the Earl of Worcester (Conan McCarty), is none too cordial.
The revival's director, Joseph Discher, now in his 22nd year with the company, fluently deploys the austere stagecraft of Shakespeare's era in his straightforward account of the play.
Jonathan Wentz's wooden set has two levels linked by a central staircase in which different heraldic banners -- and a bit of hanging taxidermy for the Boar's Head tavern scenes -- are switched to establish the story's locations. Paul H. Canada's costumes modestly suggest early-1400s styles. In his clever use of similar tawny, brocaded fabrics for the clothes usually worn by Henry and Falstaff, the designer visually links Hal's opposite father figures.
It is obvious that Henry's ornate crown weighs heavily on his head, and Mr. Harris effectively gives the king the anxious, weary manner of a man distracted by many troubles. For all of Falstaff's wine-soaked girth and chronically bleary air, Mr. Ahlin's character, with his picturesque whiskers, possesses a roistering vitality that makes him raffish good/bad company for Hal. It is a credit both to the director's evenhanded approach to the play and to Mr. Ahlin's discretion as an actor that this lovable Falstaff does not completely steal every scene in which the lusty old reprobate appears.
Mr. Wilson's boyish-looking Hal is an unassuming fellow whose affable nature gradually turns steelier as his sense of purpose grows. Late in the play, he shows Hal to be lovingly supportive of his flagging father during the battle scenes at Shrewsbury, which are staged with economy and slow-motion touches by Michael Rossmy, the fight director.
Hotspur is usually construed as a romantic warrior, but Mr. Barker puts an interesting, peevish spin on this hero, who evidently suffers from the same disgruntled mood shared by his cranky Percy elders. Glowing in a white gown, Izzie Steele fervently portrays Hotspur's adoring wife, Kate. Maxon Davis cuts a dashing figure as the spirited yet not-so-helpful Scottish rebel, the Earl of Douglas, while Drew Dix blusters amusingly as Glendower, the mystical Welsh chieftain.
The most colorful personages among the beery Boar's Head tavern crowd are Patrick Toon's red-nosed Bardolph, Jeffrey M. Bender's snaggletoothed Poins and Jesse Graham's forthright Mistress Quickly.
Shakespeare's histories sometimes are judged as dry stuff compared with his comedies and tragedies, but when staged with spirit and intelligence, as this production is, they winningly come to life.
''Henry IV, Part 1,'' by William Shakespeare, is at the F. M. Kirby Shakespeare Theater at Drew University, 36 Madison Avenue, Madison, through June 24. Information: (973) 408-5600 or shakespearenj.org.

HEADLINE: Why Punish the Savers?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
While championing the cause of the unemployed, ''It's Time for the Fed to Lead the Fight'' (Economic View, June 10) didn't address the current plight of the many millions of Americans whose savings have continued to finance the Federal Reserve's easy-money policies. 
Even if inflation is nominally low, monetary policy that results in negative real interest rates over an extended period confiscates meaningful wealth from savers. Lax monetary policy only exacerbates problems, leaving an unfair burden on Americans who have worked hard for their savings and decided to live within their means.
The best thing the Fed can do is to make a long-term commitment to a market-based economy, and that starts with a long-term commitment to stop subsidizing the cost of borrowing. How likely do you think business is to hire new workers if it feels that our economy can grow only with the help of artificial stimuli?

HEADLINE: I'll Take The Rothko for $87 Million

 BODY:
Adam Davidson's column on the record prices in the contemporary art market supplies more evidence, as if it were needed, that rarefied prices have little to do with much of anything that makes sense. The art world is just a microcosm of the way the elite economy operates. 
MICHAEL JOHNSTON, Hamilton, N.Y., posted on nytimes.com
When art becomes primarily an object to be bought and sold at market value, the entire purpose of artistic expression is sullied. It certainly is true that ''a thing of beauty is a joy forever,'' but these vulgar ''collectors'' buying art in the hope that it will ''pay off'' in appreciated value take all the joy out of it. If crass commercialism is unavoidable, at the very least artists should be able to avoid being exploited by the market. I would be in favor of a royalty system whereby the artist and her heirs share in the resale of her artistic works.
WILLIAM O. BEEMAN, Minneapolis, posted on nytimes.com
There is a vastly different art market out there from the one that Davidson describes: galleries featuring living, working artists in all sorts of media; art fairs; artists showing their work online. People will plunk down $200 for a new cellphone or $700 for a tablet that lasts -- what, three years? Or $20,000 for a car that might last 10? A thing of beauty is a joy forever, and it may cost only $300 or $3,000. Collect art because you love it. And if it turns out to increase in value over time, you can tell people how insightful you were to get it!

HEADLINE: 'Loompaland Is a Complicated Place'

BYLINE: By STEPHEN MARCHE

 BODY:
''Dad, why do the pirates have a gorilla?'' This unexpected question intruded on a recent intergenerational cultural exchange: I was introducing my 6-year-old son to Asterix the Gaul. The pirates in the ''Asterix'' comics don't travel with a gorilla, of course. One of the pirate crew is a grotesque caricature of an African who does indeed more closely resemble a gorilla than a person.
Freeze-frame on this parenting situation. What am I supposed to do? I figure I have three options.
1) Explain that the gorilla is supposed to be a black person. 
2) Try to explain the history of French colonialism, how the economics of exploitation in sub-Saharan Africa led to an ideology of racism, which survived in a ghostly transfer even after the conclusion of the French Empire, infecting even silly comics about ancient Gaul.
3) Say, ''I don't know why the pirates have a gorilla'' and flip to the next page.
Naturally I chose 3 -- the cowardly choice. There will be time enough to explain the cruelties of history later, I figure. Nonetheless I am left with the queasy knowledge that I had better come up with a solution soon, because my lies and obfuscations are washing ever thinner, and the summer movie season is coming as well, with new ''Ice Age'' and ''Madagascar'' installments. Their ethnic typologies and attitudes -- from Ray Romano as a Brooklyn-fuhgeddaboudit woolly mammoth to Chris Rock as a zebra whose catchphrase is ''crackalackin!'' -- resemble a sort of preglobalization New York. Besides, much of the great old children's material, like so much of the great old adult material, is either racist to the core or at least has seriously racist bits. Learning to negotiate around them or through them is something that every parent has to do, unless you want to waste your children's precious young lives sticking strictly to ''approved literature'' and Winnie-the-Pooh.
Some decisions are easy. ''The Story of Little Black Sambo,'' say, or ''Tintin in the Congo.'' Herge himself was deeply embarrassed by the latter book, brushing it off as a youthful error. The British bookstore chain Waterstones removed the book from the shelves of the children's section. The Brooklyn Public Library has placed ''Tintin in the Congo'' in a special, by-appointment-only rare-books section. As parents, we know what to do with this stuff: Certainly never show it to young kids.
That decision is made so much easier by the fact that both of those books are lousy. The only memorable part of ''Tintin in the Congo'' is a scene in which Tintin hunts a rhinoceros by blowing it up with dynamite. And who will mourn Little Black Sambo?
Much trickier is material that is otherwise excellent but contains significant racist passages. Michael Chabon recently wrote about negotiating (and ultimately eliminating) the racial epithets while reading ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' to his kids, following a painful and honest discussion about it with them. I admire his spirit of openness, but I have to admit I would never have had the stomach to imitate him -- either in the willful alteration or the discussion about it.
So we're left wondering how to approach, say, ''Dumbo'' with its racist-stereotype crows, or the original ''Pippi Longstocking'' trilogy. The publishers of ''Pippi Longstocking'' long ago changed certain phrases in the books -- the Swedish negerkung was traditionally translated as ''Cannibal King'' until a 2007 edition, in which the translation became ''King of Natives.'' But one German theologian has recently proposed explanatory footnotes to turn the most problematic passages -- the black children abasing themselves before Pippi, for example -- into educational opportunities. Even the most politically correct among us are unwilling to toss ''Pippi'' out completely; after all, despite her appearance in a book with racist elements, she has become a feminist icon.
Sometimes the racist passages can be excised completely, and our crimes can be covered up. If you really want to upset yourself, go to YouTube and look up the original 1940 ''Pastoral Symphony'' section from Disney's ''Fantasia.'' Sunflower the centaur, an amalgam of antebellum pickaninny stereotypes, polishes the hooves and primps the tails of the pastel-colored female centaurs while they prepare to frolic in the wilderness. The scenario is one of maximum sadness and horror; in the American imagination of 1940, even the world of little-girl centaurs was one of humiliating subjugation. But Disney edited the sequence for rerelease in the '60s, and all subsequent rereleases, which means that I can show ''Fantasia'' to my son.
Other classics have been successfully rewritten. In the first edition of Roald Dahl's ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,'' the Oompa-Loompas were members of an African tribe displaced by Willy Wonka to the northern industrial hinterland. Not quite so funny anymore that his workers worship him like a god, is it? Or that he keeps them scrupulously isolated from the general population? Or that he pays them in cocoa beans? For the second edition in 1973, Dahl changed the Oompa-Loompas from black pygmies into ''rosy-white'' creatures with long ''golden-brown'' hair. The 1971 movie made them orange-skinned with green hair. Loompaland is a complicated place.
We rewrite the past to serve the needs of the present. The clarity of history is its great advantage. The racism in ''Fantasia'' or ''Pippi Longstocking'' is overt: instantly identifiable by its noxious odor and satisfyingly dismissible with enlightened disgust. More subtle instances may provoke hedging and justification. The ''Babar'' series of books has long been the subject of ferocious debates about its status as a propagandistic celebration of colonialism. The argument makes complete sense to me -- the elephants return to their native land bearing the gifts of civilization learned in the metropolis and make war on the rhinoceroses who don't share the benefits of acculturation. But as a practical parenting matter, I don't care. My son won't be turned into a more effective colonist by stories of elephants riding elevators.
Besides, ''Babar'' is boring. The influence of the more recent ''Star Wars'' installments is more profound, and it worries me. I managed to avoid the recent rerelease of ''Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' in 3-D, but only barely. Every father who loves the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy eventually runs into the fiasco that is Jar Jar Binks -- a character capable of destroying a generation's worth of affection with a single rustle of his oversize ears. While many have noted Jar Jar as a racist stereotype, it's unclear exactly which stereotype he is. Is Jar Jar a Rastafarian stoner or a Stepin Fetchit or a Zuluesque savage? Or is he just a Gungan? And what about Watto, also from ''The Phantom Menace''? A dark-skinned, hooknosed, greedy slaveholder, he's an all-purpose anti-Semitic caricature. Or possibly he's just a hovering bad guy in a fantasy world. The conundrum is how to explain to your kids that Jar Jar and Watto are stereotypes without first introducing the stereotypes that you are hoping to negate.
Even Pixar, which deserves the gratitude of every parent for its nearly unbroken series of classics, indulges a surprising amount of relatively crude stereotyping. In one of my favorites, ''Monsters, Inc.,'' Sulley and Mike, on the way into the office, happen to pass an orange squidlike grocer with a handlebar mustache who kind of talks-a-like-a-this. Perhaps that kind of stereotype is not as gruesome or upsetting as the one in the original ''Fantasia,'' but I had the distinct impression, as my son laughed at the scene, that my Italian immigrant grandfather was turning over in his grave.
How am I supposed to explain to a child the superimposition of cultural generalizations onto toy cars and monsters and space aliens? I can barely explain it to myself. Blissfully unaware of what is being promoted, children love those movies. Try convincing any kid under the age of 12 that ''The Empire Strikes Back'' is a better movie than ''The Phantom Menace,'' or that ''Finding Nemo'' is better than ''Cars 2.'' You'll be laughed at. Stereotypes are part of what children want from stories, which of course connects to what we all want from stories: simplification. We want all stepmothers to be evil. We want all huntsmen to be heroes. And apparently, for the most part, we want characters' ethnicities to be equally simplistic, whether the movie is set in a monster world or an ice age or Madagascar. Who knows what the consequences are or whether there are any? Is it because children like the simplification? Or are our minds simplified by exposure to these early stereotypes?
Despite my misgivings, I know that I won't be able to give up Asterix. My relationship to the comic is too deep; it was made too early, bound up with my own childhood. They were the only comics we were allowed to read in French class in Canada. (The Smurfs were banned because of their limited vocabulary.) When I gashed my knee playing tag in the back alley behind my house and had to have 15 stitches, the treat that I received for being brave was ''Asterix in Britain.'' And so I'm hedging, cravenly. I believe this is the very definition of white liberal guilt: I feel bad but I won't change my behavior.
That familiar and insoluble knot of moral difficulty is infinitely complicated by the fact that I'm sharing it with a child. I don't want to explain the human gorilla and all the chains of horror that went into that caricature because I'm afraid of the follow-up questions. Recently as I was laying down ant traps against the annual spring invasion, my son asked me, ''Do ants have souls?'' I didn't have a good answer for that. What is he going to ask when I explain that for 400 years, white people took black people from their homes in Africa, carried them across the ocean in chains, beat them to death as they worked to produce sugar and cotton, separated them from their children and felt entitled to do so because of the difference in the color of their skin? Whatever he asks next, I'm pretty sure I won't have an adequate reply.
Academic notions of the unspeakability of historical horrors become very immediate in the face of a child. There are many children's books to help children understand the horror of history, or introduce them to the failure to understand the horror of history. But explaining how those horrors play out in everyday life, through a thousand subtle means, often unexpected, like children's books, seems nearly impossible. No doubt I want to shelter my son and also myself, but I think, in some vague, indefinable way, I want to shelter the past too. I'm embarrassed for humanity at all this nonsense, and I don't want to submit the world to the complete and perfect judgment of an innocent.
We all need to grow up, I know. Me, the moviemakers, the audience. The only person who seems mature enough for the situation is the 6-year old. All he sees is a gorilla with some pirates.

HEADLINE: Disputing Whether a Treasure Needs a Name Upgrade

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
GRAND JUNCTION, Colo. -- In 1906, a vagabond with an eye for beauty named John Otto fell in love with the unscarred land out here. After seeing the sandstone spires and hypnotic canyons that rise above this town, he made a decision: ''I'm going to stay and build trails and promote this place,'' he wrote, ''because it should be a national park.''
A century later, that goal may be near. But it has not come without a fight. 
The canyons that enthralled Mr. Otto never quite won the prize of becoming a national park. Instead, they were given the lesser designation of a national monument -- one of about 100 nationwide -- and named, rather simply, the Colorado National Monument. Mr. Otto served as the first custodian, earning $1 a month.
But over time, local officials began to complain that the monument's second-class status and humdrum name were keeping visitors at bay. Sometimes, they said, confused tourists would even ask for directions to the statue or plaque, because wasn't this place some kind of monument to something?
So last year, in stepped the federal government with an idea that would have delighted John Otto: make the Colorado National Monument a full national park. Or at the very least, give it a more evocative name, something that conjures canyons the color of sunset instead of a dusty obelisk in the middle of the desert.
To some residents, it was the perfect solution, a cheap and easy sleight of hand that might entice more tourists to pull off Interstate 70, explore the newly minted park and leaven the hotels, cafes and restaurants of a county with 9.1 percent unemployment.
But to others, the whole thing smelled like Big Government intruding where it was neither wanted nor needed. They did not want the traffic or congestion that would come with greater visibility, and they worried that the government would block access to local residents who largely used the monument's roads as a shortcut between town and their homes on the other side.
''When the government gets involved, you never know what they're going to do,'' said Delwin Docter, a volunteer firefighter in the community of Glade Park, a stronghold of opposition to the plan. Mr. Docter pointed out that the fire company was paid for by donations and a weekly summer movie night, not by tax dollars.
For a conservative corner of a Western swing state with a deep commitment to land and preservation and to being left alone by the government, the skepticism was not surprising.
It is also uncertain what kind of a bump, if any, the monument would get from a new designation. Last year, about 435,000 bicyclists, hikers and driving tourists passed through. That is a pittance compared with the 2.5 million people who visited Zion National Park in southern Utah, but significantly more than the 168,000 who toured the Black Canyon National Park in a remote corner of western Colorado.
Proponents of rebranding the monument as a park said there would be no changes to how the canyons were managed and no new rules restricting local residents from zipping through the area to get groceries or go to work. The National Park Service, which has run the land since 1911, would continue to be in charge. The costs would entail only a few thousand dollars to print up new brochures and install new signs. An act of Congress would make it so.
''This is a no-brainer,'' said Greg Mikolai, a member of a local committee that has been studying the issue. Sometime in the next month, the group is expected to make a recommendation to Senator Mark Udall and Representative Scott Tipton, who would then make the next moves -- if any -- in Washington.
An online survey by the committee and public forums suggested that people were evenly split -- 40 percent in favor of making a change, 40 percent opposed and 20 percent who said they did not know or did not care. The comment cards from a few of the public meetings in April show the passions stirred by the proposal.
Residents, many who grew up ranching the high mesas or exploring the monument's desolate canyons years ago, said the monument was special precisely because it was so easily overlooked by tourists bound for marquee national parks. Some said they worried about car crashes, fires, garbage and increased pollution. They worried that its boundaries would grow, pushing at their property lines.
''Do you really want more people?'' one commenter asked. ''More problems?''
And: ''Please don't ruin a beautiful place for economic gain.''
''There was a very vocal degree of antigovernment attitude over here,'' said Ken Henry, a former mayor of the nearby town of Fruita and a member of the study committee. The opposition, he said, is ''looking for a federal boogeyman under every piece of sagebrush.''
But mostly, it seemed as if people did not want to lose something they had long felt was truly theirs.
Ellen Roberts, who lives in Fruita, wrote of how her mother rode horses through the trails before there were paved roads snaking around the canyons. Her husband had helped build the road up to the area.
''I want it the way it has always been,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A Jersey Shore Rebound

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WASHBURN

 BODY:
WHILE towns along the Jersey Shore reinvented themselves during the boom of the aughts, sprouting boutique hotels and upscale restaurants, Asbury Park retained a refreshing, rare Americana charm. Restaurants -- and boutique hotels -- arrived, but they have had to share the Boardwalk with nostalgic attractions like a pinball museum and a psychic. And a majestic urban ghost presides over it all: the Boardwalk ends at the magnificent shell of a 1920s-era casino and carousel house.
If Asbury Park's history of bust and rebirth offers a lesson, it's that hard luck inspires good times. 
''There's nothing like it in the world,'' said Marilyn Schlossbach, a co-owner of the three-year-old Langosta Lounge (1000 Ocean Avenue; 732-455-3275; langostalounge.com), a beachfront restaurant featuring ''vacation cuisine'' like Haliimaile rigatoni: shrimp, scallops and asparagus served in a cilantro, macadamia nut pesto.
Such pride is abundant in Asbury Park, which emerged from decades of economic hardship five years ago and blossomed into a progressive community that preserved what Ms. Schlossbach calls its ''peculiar quirkiness.''
The last 18 months have been particularly transformative for one formerly forlorn area. Enlivened by a group of entrepreneurs mostly in their late 20s and early 30s, Bangs Avenue has become a hip extension of Asbury Park's robust cultural and culinary scene.
''Last year at this time there was nobody,'' Paul Cali said recently as he motioned toward the bustle of Bangs Avenue. ''Now it's a neighborhood.'' Mr. Cali, 30, is the co-owner of Cafe Volan (510 Bangs Avenue; 732-455-3399; cafevolan.com), a relaxed, airy cafe a stroll from the ocean. In addition to brewing coffee with rich, sophisticated textures, Cafe Volan, which opened a year ago, has become a social centerpiece for the newly invigorated street.
Blue Hawaii, a vintage clothing shop, Wood Shop Skateboards, and ReBearth Artist Boutique have all recently opened, and none of the shop owners is older than 40.
Across the street from Cafe Volan is Sweet Joey's (523 Bangs Avenue; 732-455-3183; sweetjoeys.com), a bespoke denim shop that also offers vintage clothes. Joey Pisch, 31, opened the shop in May 2011, where he works alongside his father, Vlado, the house tailor. ''My father started making jeans in the '70s for his friends,'' Mr. Pisch said of his father's life in Communist Czechoslovakia, ''because Western jeans cost a month's wages.'' Vlad jeans, as they're called, run around $300.
Like the rest of Asbury Park, the Bangs Avenue scene is welcoming and unassuming, but the Colonel's Kissing Booth (516 Summerfield Avenue; 732-455-3500) sets new standards of friendliness. Its small, well-executed menu features brunch standards -- omelets, burgers -- and its owner, Shiah Blau, 25, seems equally energized by his food and his community. ''Once you get here, you feel at home,'' Mr. Blau said of his restaurant and his hometown. And you can't help but feel at home there since the staff consists of Mr. Blau, his mother, his two sisters, and his best friend.
Of course, Asbury Park is known for music and its famous former resident Bruce Springsteen. Both the historic Stone Pony and Asbury Lanes, a perfect blend of music venue and well-scuffed bowling alley, still host bands, and the town was recently overtaken by the Asbury-born Bamboozle Festival's 90,000 fans, many of whom showed up for local heroes Bon Jovi. The Press Room (610 Bangs Avenue; 732-455-5945; thepressroomap.com), an intimate, sleek rock venue owned by the locals Alicia and Trip Brooks, just opened this year but has already secured a position in the town's genealogy. In February, Mr. Springsteen played a surprise show there, and the photos for his ''Wrecking Ball'' album were shot at the club.
''It's a town that looks to keep the people that care about it,'' Ms. Schlossbach of the Langosta Lounge said.

HEADLINE: You For Sale

BYLINE: By NATASHA SINGER

 BODY:
IT knows who you are. It knows where you live. It knows what you do.
It peers deeper into American life than the F.B.I. or the I.R.S., or those prying digital eyes at Facebook and Google. If you are an American adult, the odds are that it knows things like your age, race, sex, weight, height, marital status, education level, politics, buying habits, household health worries, vacation dreams -- and on and on.
Right now in Conway, Ark., north of Little Rock, more than 23,000 computer servers are collecting, collating and analyzing consumer data for a company that, unlike Silicon Valley's marquee names, rarely makes headlines. It's called the Acxiom Corporation, and it's the quiet giant of a multibillion-dollar industry known as database marketing.
Few consumers have ever heard of Acxiom. But analysts say it has amassed the world's largest commercial database on consumers -- and that it wants to know much, much more. Its servers process more than 50 trillion data ''transactions'' a year. Company executives have said its database contains information about 500 million active consumers worldwide, with about 1,500 data points per person. That includes a majority of adults in the United States. 
Such large-scale data mining and analytics -- based on information available in public records, consumer surveys and the like -- are perfectly legal. Acxiom's customers have included big banks like Wells Fargo and HSBC, investment services like E*Trade, automakers like Toyota and Ford, department stores like Macy's -- just about any major company looking for insight into its customers.
For Acxiom, based in Little Rock, the setup is lucrative. It posted profit of $77.26 million in its latest fiscal year, on sales of $1.13 billion.
But such profits carry a cost for consumers. Federal authorities say current laws may not be equipped to handle the rapid expansion of an industry whose players often collect and sell sensitive financial and health information yet are nearly invisible to the public. In essence, it's as if the ore of our data-driven lives were being mined, refined and sold to the highest bidder, usually without our knowledge -- by companies that most people rarely even know exist.
Julie Brill, a member of the Federal Trade Commission, says she would like data brokers in general to tell the public about the data they collect, how they collect it, whom they share it with and how it is used. ''If someone is listed as diabetic or pregnant, what is happening with this information? Where is the information going?'' she asks. ''We need to figure out what the rules should be as a society.''
Although Acxiom employs a chief privacy officer, Jennifer Barrett Glasgow, she and other executives declined requests to be interviewed for this article, said Ines Rodriguez Gutzmer, director of corporate communications.
In March, however, Ms. Barrett Glasgow endorsed increased industry openness. ''It's not an unreasonable request to have more transparency among data brokers,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times. In marketing materials, Acxiom promotes itself as ''a global thought leader in addressing consumer privacy issues and earning the public trust.''
But, in interviews, security experts and consumer advocates paint a portrait of a company with practices that privilege corporate clients' interests over those of consumers and contradict the company's stance on transparency. Acxiom's marketing materials, for example, promote a special security system for clients and associates to encrypt the data they send. Yet cybersecurity experts who examined Acxiom's Web site for The Times found basic security lapses on an online form for consumers seeking access to their own profiles. (Acxiom says it has fixed the broken link that caused the problem.)
In a fast-changing digital economy, Acxiom is developing even more advanced techniques to mine and refine data. It has recruited talent from Microsoft, Google, Amazon.com and Myspace and is using a powerful, multiplatform approach to predicting consumer behavior that could raise its standing among investors and clients.
Of course, digital marketers already customize pitches to users, based on their past activities. Just think of ''cookies,'' bits of computer code placed on browsers to keep track of online activity. But Acxiom, analysts say, is pursuing far more comprehensive techniques in an effort to influence consumer decisions. It is integrating what it knows about our offline, online and even mobile selves, creating in-depth behavior portraits in pixilated detail. Its executives have called this approach a ''360-degree view'' on consumers.
''There's a lot of players in the digital space trying the same thing,'' says Mark Zgutowicz, a Piper Jaffray analyst. ''But Acxiom's advantage is they have a database of offline information that they have been collecting for 40 years and can leverage that expertise in the digital world.''
Yet some prominent privacy advocates worry that such techniques could lead to a new era of consumer profiling.
Jeffrey Chester, executive director of the Center for Digital Democracy, a nonprofit group in Washington, says: ''It is Big Brother in Arkansas.''
SCOTT HUGHES, an up-and-coming small-business owner and Facebook denizen, is Acxiom's ideal consumer. Indeed, it created him.
Mr. Hughes is a fictional character who appeared in an Acxiom investor presentation in 2010. A frequent shopper, he was designed to show the power of Acxiom's multichannel approach.
In the presentation, he logs on to Facebook and sees that his friend Ella has just become a fan of Bryce Computers, an imaginary electronics retailer and Acxiom client. Ella's update prompts Mr. Hughes to check out Bryce's fan page and do some digital window-shopping for a fast inkjet printer.
Such browsing seems innocuous -- hardly data mining. But it cues an Acxiom system designed to recognize consumers, remember their actions, classify their behaviors and influence them with tailored marketing.
When Mr. Hughes follows a link to Bryce's retail site, for example, the system recognizes him from his Facebook activity and shows him a printer to match his interest. He registers on the site, but doesn't buy the printer right away, so the system tracks him online. Lo and behold, the next morning, while he scans baseball news on ESPN.com, an ad for the printer pops up again.
That evening, he returns to the Bryce site where, the presentation says, ''he is instantly recognized'' as having registered. It then offers a sweeter deal: a $10 rebate and free shipping.
It's not a random offer. Acxiom has its own classification system, PersonicX, which assigns consumers to one of 70 detailed socioeconomic clusters and markets to them accordingly. In this situation, it pegs Mr. Hughes as a ''savvy single'' -- meaning he's in a cluster of mobile, upper-middle-class people who do their banking online, attend pro sports events, are sensitive to prices -- and respond to free-shipping offers.
Correctly typecast, Mr. Hughes buys the printer.
But the multichannel system of Acxiom and its online partners is just revving up. Later, it sends him coupons for ink and paper, to be redeemed via his cellphone, and a personalized snail-mail postcard suggesting that he donate his old printer to a nearby school.
Analysts say companies design these sophisticated ecosystems to prompt consumers to volunteer enough personal data -- like their names, e-mail addresses and mobile numbers -- so that marketers can offer them customized appeals any time, anywhere.
Still, there is a fine line between customization and stalking. While many people welcome the convenience of personalized offers, others may see the surveillance engines behind them as intrusive or even manipulative.
''If you look at it in cold terms, it seems like they are really out to trick the customer,'' says Dave Frankland, the research director for customer intelligence at Forrester Research. ''But they are actually in the business of helping marketers make sure that the right people are getting offers they are interested in and therefore establish a relationship with the company.''
DECADES before the Internet as we know it, a businessman named Charles Ward planted the seeds of Acxiom. It was 1969, and Mr. Ward started a data processing company in Conway called Demographics Inc., in part to help the Democratic Party reach voters. In a time when Madison Avenue was deploying one-size-fits-all national ad campaigns, Demographics and its lone computer used public phone books to compile lists for direct mailing of campaign material.
Today, Acxiom maintains its own database on about 190 million individuals and 126 million households in the United States. Separately, it manages customer databases for or works with 47 of the Fortune 100 companies. It also worked with the government after the September 2001 terrorist attacks, providing information about 11 of the 19 hijackers.
To beef up its digital services, Acxiom recently mounted an aggressive hiring campaign. Last July, it named Scott E. Howe, a former corporate vice president for Microsoft's advertising business group, as C.E.O. Last month, it hired Phil Mui, formerly group product manager for Google Analytics, as its chief product and engineering officer.
In interviews, Mr. Howe has laid out a vision of Acxiom as a new-millennium ''data refinery'' rather than a data miner. That description posits Acxiom as a nimble provider of customer analytics services, able to compete with Facebook and Google, rather than as a stealth engine of consumer espionage.
Still, the more that information brokers mine powerful consumer data, the more they become attractive targets for hackers -- and draw scrutiny from consumer advocates.
This year, Advertising Age ranked Epsilon, another database marketing firm, as the biggest advertising agency in the United States, with Acxiom second. Most people know Epsilon, if they know it at all, because it experienced a major security breach last year, exposing the e-mail addresses of millions of customers of Citibank, JPMorgan Chase, Target, Walgreens and others. In 2003, Acxiom had its own security breaches.
But privacy advocates say they are more troubled by data brokers' ranking systems, which classify some people as high-value prospects, to be offered marketing deals and discounts regularly, while dismissing others as low-value -- known in industry slang as ''waste.''
Exclusion from a vacation offer may not matter much, says Pam Dixon, the executive director of the World Privacy Forum, a nonprofit group in San Diego, but if marketing algorithms judge certain people as not worthy of receiving promotions for higher education or health services, they could have a serious impact.
''Over time, that can really turn into a mountain of pathways not offered, not seen and not known about,'' Ms. Dixon says.
Until now, database marketers operated largely out of the public eye. Unlike consumer reporting agencies that sell sensitive financial information about people for credit or employment purposes, database marketers aren't required by law to show consumers their own reports and allow them to correct errors. That may be about to change. This year, the F.T.C. published a report calling for greater transparency among data brokers and asking Congress to give consumers the right to access information these firms hold about them.
ACXIOM'S Consumer Data Products Catalog offers hundreds of details -- called ''elements'' -- that corporate clients can buy about individuals or households, to augment their own marketing databases. Companies can buy data to pinpoint households that are concerned, say, about allergies, diabetes or ''senior needs.'' Also for sale is information on sizes of home loans and household incomes.
Clients generally buy this data because they want to hold on to their best customers or find new ones -- or both.
A bank that wants to sell its best customers additional services, for example, might buy details about those customers' social media, Web and mobile habits to identify more efficient ways to market to them. Or, says Mr. Frankland at Forrester, a sporting goods chain whose best customers are 25- to 34-year-old men living near mountains or beaches could buy a list of a million other people with the same characteristics. The retailer could hire Acxiom, he says, to manage a campaign aimed at that new group, testing how factors like consumers' locations or sports preferences affect responses.
But the catalog also offers delicate information that has set off alarm bells among some privacy advocates, who worry about the potential for misuse by third parties that could take aim at vulnerable groups. Such information includes consumers' interests -- derived, the catalog says, ''from actual purchases and self-reported surveys'' -- like ''Christian families,'' ''Dieting/Weight Loss,'' ''Gaming-Casino,'' ''Money Seekers'' and ''Smoking/Tobacco.'' Acxiom also sells data about an individual's race, ethnicity and country of origin. ''Our Race model,'' the catalog says, ''provides information on the major racial category: Caucasians, Hispanics, African-Americans, or Asians.'' Competing companies sell similar data.
Acxiom's data about race or ethnicity is ''used for engaging those communities for marketing purposes,'' said Ms. Barrett Glasgow, the privacy officer, in an e-mail response to questions.
There may be a legitimate commercial need for some businesses, like ethnic restaurants, to know the race or ethnicity of consumers, says Joel R. Reidenberg, a privacy expert and a professor at the Fordham Law School.
''At the same time, this is ethnic profiling,'' he says. ''The people on this list, they are being sold based on their ethnic stereotypes. There is a very strong citizen's right to have a veto over the commodification of their profile.''
He says the sale of such data is troubling because race coding may be incorrect. And even if a data broker has correct information, a person may not want to be marketed to based on race.
''DO you really know your customers?'' Acxiom asks in marketing materials for its shopper recognition system, a program that uses ZIP codes to help retailers confirm consumers' identities -- without asking their permission.
''Simply asking for name and address information poses many challenges: transcription errors, increased checkout time and, worse yet, losing customers who feel that you're invading their privacy,'' Acxiom's fact sheet explains. In its system, a store clerk need only ''capture the shopper's name from a check or third-party credit card at the point of sale and then ask for the shopper's ZIP code or telephone number.'' With that data Acxiom can identify shoppers within a 10 percent margin of error, it says, enabling stores to reward their best customers with special offers. Other companies offer similar services.
''This is a direct way of circumventing people's concerns about privacy,'' says Mr. Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy.
Ms. Barrett Glasgow of Acxiom says that its program is a ''standard practice'' among retailers, but that the company encourages its clients to report consumers who wish to opt out.
Acxiom has positioned itself as an industry leader in data privacy, but some of its practices seem to undermine that image. It created the position of chief privacy officer in 1991, well ahead of its rivals. It even offers an online request form, promoted as an easy way for consumers to access information Acxiom collects about them.
But the process turned out to be not so user-friendly for a reporter for The Times.
In early May, the reporter decided to request her record from Acxiom, as any consumer might. Before submitting a Social Security number and other personal information, however, she asked for advice from a cybersecurity expert at The Times. The expert examined Acxiom's Web site and immediately noticed that the online form did not employ a standard encryption protocol -- called https -- used by sites like Amazon and American Express. When the expert tested the form, using software that captures data sent over the Web, he could clearly see that the sample Social Security number he had submitted had not been encrypted. At that point, the reporter was advised not to request her file, given the risk that the process might expose her personal information.
Later in May, Ashkan Soltani, an independent security researcher and former technologist in identity protection at the F.T.C., also examined Acxiom's site and came to the same conclusion. ''Parts of the site for corporate clients are encrypted,'' he says. ''But for consumers, who this information is about and who stand the most to lose from data collection, they don't provide security.''
Ms. Barrett Glasgow says that the form has always been encrypted with https but that on May 11, its security monitoring system detected a ''broken redirect link'' that allowed unencrypted access. Since then, she says, Acxiom has fixed the link and determined that no unauthorized person had gained access to information sent using the form.
On May 25, the reporter submitted an online request to Acxiom for her file, along with a personal check, sent by Express Mail, for the $5 processing fee. Three weeks later, no response had arrived.
Regulators at the F.T.C. declined to comment on the practices of individual companies. But Jon Leibowitz, the commission chairman, said consumers should have the right to see and correct personal details about them collected and sold by data aggregators.
After all, he said, ''they are the unseen cyberazzi who collect information on all of us.''

HEADLINE: Taking Advantage of Low Rates

BYLINE: By VICKIE ELMER

 BODY:
THE mortgage market seems to have been dancing its own version of the limbo, as interest rates headed lower and lower for six consecutive weeks.
Although they inched up this past week, home buyers and refinancers may be wondering how low rates can go -- and how they can capture the best rates now.
''Mortgage rates tend to fall when there are concerns about the economy,'' said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Trulia, the housing information Web site. 
Lately, those concerns have centered on the economic and fiscal woes in Europe, especially in Greece and Spain -- along with slow job growth and weaker-than-usual corporate profits in this country, as noted in a recent Freddie Mac market survey.
Many economists are forecasting that mortgage rates will rise again later this year as the American economy gradually improves and as more global investors turn to the United States as a safe haven for their money.
''It's really tough for rates to go much lower,'' said Cristian de Ritis, the director of Moody's Analytics. ''It's almost unbelievable that you can get a 30-year mortgage at that rate.''
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to a record 3.67 percent nationwide in Freddie Mac's June 7 survey, though it rose to an average 3.71 percent on Thursday. The rate had averaged 3.9 percent just three months earlier and 4.5 percent a year earlier.
Mr. Kolko said the uptick was not entirely unexpected. ''We're in the midst of so much short-term uncertainty,'' he said, adding that ''no single week-over-week change can be taken as the start of a long-term trend.''
Mr. de Ritis said that rates could possibly fall further, perhaps as much as a quarter of a percentage point, but he added that it was more likely that they would start ''a slow drift'' upward. In six months, the rate on the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage could be at 3.8 to 3.9 percent, he predicted, and a year from now, 4.1 to 4.2 percent.
''If the economy does recover more aggressively than what we think, or what investors think,'' he said, ''then the Fed will likely raise rates.'' The next two Federal Reserve Open Market meetings, which determine credit policy, are scheduled for June 19 and 20 and July 31 and Aug. 1.
Those planning to refinance or buy a home in the next two or three months, meanwhile, might want to consider locking in their mortgage rate now.
Borrowers with rate lock-ins, with a built-in deadline, often receive priority treatment from lenders, according to Russell Tucker, a senior vice president of Investor Home Mortgage in Short Hills, N.J. By having a lock-in, he said, a borrower is telling the lender that he or she is serious about closing soon. ''If you're not willing to lock in the interest rates,'' Mr. Tucker said, ''you're not doing the push-ups.''
Lock-in costs and policies vary widely, and are based partly on the time frame you want covered.
Most people will need a 60- to 90-day lock. In New York State, especially, refinancing can take longer if the borrower is transferring the balance on a loan to a new lender to avoid paying a second mortgage transfer tax, a process known as ''mortgage assignment.''
If interest rates continue to fall during the lock period, borrowers can ask their lenders to rewrite the rate lock, at an additional cost, or they can obtain a ''float-down'' provision in the original agreement, industry experts say. A lock with a float-down agreement allows the borrower to change the rate, often only once, before closing on the mortgage. This option is generally more expensive than a standard lock.
Although mortgage rates are at historic lows, borrowers need to understand that the advertised rates are generally for those with the best credit. ''If your credit is in the mid-600s instead of the mid-700s, that could be as much as an extra percentage point on your mortgage rate,'' Mr. Kolko said, referring to the widely used FICO credit score.
And if you're in the New York area and borrowing more than $625,500 -- the maximum allowed for loans resold to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac -- you will be obtaining a ''jumbo'' loan, which tends to carry higher rates.
Correction: June 24, 2012, Sunday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: The Mortgages column last Sunday, about taking advantage of low interest rates, misstated the maximum amount allowed for mortgages to be resold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the New York area. It is $625,500, not $729,750.

HEADLINE: In Moscow, Iran to Face Critical Choice in the Latest Round of Nuclear Talks

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and ELLEN BARRY; Mark Landler reported from Washington, and Ellen Barry from Moscow. Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The calendar will loom large over the next round of Iran nuclear talks.
Less than two weeks after its diplomats meet on Monday with those of the United States and five other major powers in Moscow, Iran faces the imposition of a potentially crippling European oil embargo and American banking sanctions.
Whether choking off Iran's main source of revenue will persuade Tehran to accept a deal that curbs its nuclear ambitions is the critical question at these talks, which follow inconclusive meetings in Baghdad and Istanbul. 
Administration officials and outside experts are loath to make a prediction.
''The reality is that they're on the verge of a choice between having a nuclear program or an economy,'' said Cliff Kupchan, a senior analyst on the Middle East at the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm. ''There's nothing like no money in your wallet to straighten your senses.''
Still, Mr. Kupchan and other analysts said they doubted there would be a breakthrough in Moscow. Even if Iran were to show a readiness to accept an interim deal -- something the economic pressure makes more plausible -- the United States and the other powers are probably not yet willing to meet Tehran's terms.
The major powers are unlikely to accept a delay in the sanctions. And President Obama is not likely to recognize Iran's right to enrich uranium, another of the Iranian leadership's cherished objectives. Granting that concession, in an election year, would open Mr. Obama to criticism from his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, who has staked out a hawkish position on Iran.
The major powers are expected to renew their list of demands that Iran suspend the enrichment of uranium to 20 percent, ship out its stockpile of this uranium, and cease operations at Fordo, an enrichment facility buried in a mountain near Qum that alarms Israel because it could soon be immune to an airstrike.
''Both sides had false expectations about how little they had to give to get the other side to move,'' said Colin H. Kahl, a former Pentagon official who is a professor at Georgetown University. ''The question going into Moscow is: Has either side recalculated?''
What distinguishes this meeting, beyond the timing, is the location. It is the first of these sessions to be held in one of the negotiating countries, Russia. And it comes at a time when Russia, facing international opprobrium because of its ties to the brutal government in Syria, could use a diplomatic victory.
For all the tension between Russia and the United States over Syria -- amplified last week by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton's claim that Russia was sending attack helicopters to Damascus -- the two countries are more closely aligned when it comes to Iran, according to officials. At the same session in which she criticized Russia about the helicopters, Mrs. Clinton foresaw a positive role for Moscow on Iran.
''The Russians have made it very clear that they expect the Iranians to advance the discussion in Moscow -- not to just come, listen and leave,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''We'll know once it happens. But I think that the unity and the resolve that has been shown thus far is of real significance.''
In Russia, too, there are domestic political motivations at play. President Vladimir V. Putin, analysts said, is eager for a foreign policy achievement to gild his recent return to the Kremlin and to distinguish his presidency from that of his predecessor and protege, Dmitri A. Medvedev, now the prime minister.
''A solution to the Iranian problem, or an attempt to solve it, may vividly demonstrate the new policy of Russia under Putin,'' said Rajab S. Safarov, director of the Center for Modern Iran Studies, who traveled to Iran with Russia's foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on a preparatory visit last week.
But other Russian analysts say that Mr. Putin is not likely to devote much time to Iran if he does not see a chance for a quick payoff. He has had a fractious relationship with Iran's president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. After risking his reputation to make a high-profile visit to Iran in 2007, Mr. Putin found Mr. Ahmadinejad ''recalcitrant or disdainful'' of Russia's search for compromise, said Dmitri V. Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center.
Iran, for its part, has been sending characteristically mixed signals. On Wednesday, after meeting Mr. Lavrov, Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Salehi, told reporters that he believed the negotiations were on the right track.
''This is a complex issue and we need to be patient, but we're on the right track,'' Mr. Salehi said. ''Sometimes the process slows down and sometimes it accelerates, but over all I'm confident about the final outcome.''
However, other Iranian officials expressed bitterness that in Baghdad, the United States had backed off recognizing Iran's right to enrich uranium, after appearing to endorse it in Istanbul. Winning that recognition, as much as winning relief from the sanctions, appears to be driving the Iranian negotiators.
Iranian officials blame Israel for the American change of heart, noting that the chief American negotiator, Wendy R. Sherman, stopped in Israel on her way home from Baghdad to brief the government.
''Why do the Americans rush off to Jerusalem after every time they have spoken to us?'' said Hamid Sheikholeslami, an adviser to Iran's former top nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani. ''The U.S. is clearly under pressure not to seriously negotiate with us.''
Administration officials dispute that, and say they have never recognized Iran's right to enrich uranium in the talks. While the West is reluctant to delay the broader sanctions, analysts said the major powers would probably be open to suspending a European Union ban on insuring Iranian oil tankers.
That ban, by itself, imposes a heavy penalty: if it remains, Mr. Kupchan estimated, Iran will be unable to export 1.5 million barrels of oil a day -- much of it to Asian customers -- reducing its revenues by $4.5 billion a month.

HEADLINE: Fair Use, Art, Swiss Cheese And Me

BYLINE: By MICHAEL RIPS. 
A lawyer and the author of ''Pasquale's Nose: Idle Days in an Italian Town.''

 BODY:
NONE of the thoughts that occurred to me on that tranquil afternoon when a slice of Swiss cheese was deposited on my face were so exotic as to include the notion that, 15 years later, I would listen to judges debate whether I should be allowed to remove the cheese and set it on fire.
And yet, such exotic questions are now before the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, where a three-judge panel will rule on a case with serious implications for the visual arts. 
In the fall of 2008, the Gagosian Gallery in New York exhibited a series of works by Richard Prince. Those works incorporated photographs that Mr. Prince had found in a book by the French photographer Patrick Cariou. The photographs were of Rastafarians living in the mountains of Jamaica. Mr. Prince borrowed one such photograph -- a Rastafarian against a dense growth of plants -- covered the man's eyes with blue circles and placed an electric guitar in his arms.
Mr. Cariou sued Mr. Prince for copyright infringement.
For me, the case recalled that afternoon, when I stood before a painting in the studio of David Salle, one of the most influential artists of our time. Mr. Salle had based the painting on a photograph of me in a black suit and tie, dignified, staring into a mirror. He was in the process of making ''finishing touches.'' I had already informed my father-in-law, whose suit I was wearing (a suit, he told me, that had brushed against the sleeve of Robert Kennedy on a hotel stairway in Cleveland), of the imminence of the portrait.
As I was about to compliment Mr. Salle on the likeness of the portrait to the photograph, he pasted the perforated wedge on my face. And that is how a photograph of me, as incorporated into one of Mr. Salle's paintings, was exhibited at the Lehmann Maupin Gallery, and that is how it remains to this day -- ''Rips in the Mirror.''
From this, you no doubt understand my sympathy for Mr. Cariou or, at least, the Rastafarian.
Mr. Prince was not as sympathetic. He fought the lawsuit, claiming that he had sufficiently altered Mr. Cariou's photographs to bring the works exhibited at Gagosian Gallery within the fair use doctrine, which allows artists to borrow from other works so long as they give a new expression or meaning to the original work. But the trial court rejected Mr. Prince's argument, thereby exposing him to liability for the millions of dollars he had earned from the exhibition and giving Mr. Cariou the right to destroy the unsold paintings.
And the court did not stop with Mr. Prince. Because Mr. Prince was known to use images from other sources, the gallery and its owner were held liable for failing to investigate Mr. Prince's paintings for copyright violations.
This caused museums across the country to file a brief with the court of appeals. They argued that they would be forced to hire lawyers to investigate their collections for works containing borrowed images, and given the ubiquity of such images in 20th-century art, the cost to the museums would be unsustainable. The more likely, though no less troubling, alternative is for museums to censor what they exhibit.
Should the law require this?
The answer revealed itself to me when, a couple of years ago, ''Rips in the Mirror'' -- one of several paintings Mr. Salle did of me, a couple with cheese -- came up for auction. Deciding to end my public association with an item more typically paired with a plate of crackers, I resolved to purchase the painting and retire it. When I explained to the young woman at the auction house what I was prepared to pay for the painting, she chuckled and then, politely, replied, ''I am sorry, sir, but recent sales for his group have been quite strong.''
''His group'' was what art critics and collectors now refer to as the ''Pictures Generation'' -- a movement of artists who, skeptical of the artistic as well as commercial images that surrounded them, appropriated those images into their own work and then subverted them. It was a strategy that drew upon the early works of James Rosenquist.
The strength of interest in the Pictures Generation has caused the prices of their works to reach sums in the millions -- stunning sums, the very sums that thwarted my attempt to remove the cheese portrait from circulation.
Richard Prince is a Pictures Generation artist.
Patrick Cariou is not. He is an ethnographic photographer, and it is the sort of photographs he takes that have been some of the subjects of appropriation and subversion by the Pictures Generation. For this reason, the markets for Mr. Prince and Mr. Cariou are not just distinct; they are conflicting. In other words, no one heading out to purchase an ethnographic photograph by Mr. Cariou (or anyone else) was going to be diverted by the Prince show at Gagosian.
And that should be the answer to the legal question. Since Mr. Prince caused no economic injury to Mr. Cariou, despite his claims to the contrary, Mr. Prince should not be required to turn over his profits (or works).
So, too, with the Salle painting. It is David Salle and the artistic movement with which he is associated, and to which he has greatly contributed, that give value to his paintings -- and not, sadly, my image. For those who believe otherwise, I have boxes of old photographs I would be happy to sell.

HEADLINE: Broken Trust Takes Time To Mend

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
PRESIDENT OBAMA caused a stir recently when he said that ''the private sector is doing fine'' and pinned many of the nation's economic troubles on a decline in public-sector employment. He cited some interesting numbers, but he didn't draw the right lesson -- namely, that America is witnessing a collapse of trust in politics, including the shaping of its broad economic policy.
Since Mr. Obama took office, 780,000 private sector jobs have been created, while the number of public sector jobs has fallen by about 600,000, mostly at the state and local level. A quick look might suggest that we need only to bolster the number of public sector jobs to have a healthier economy, but there is a deeper way to think about the problem. 
State and local governments are controlled by politicians and, indirectly, by voters. And for better or worse, those voters have lost faith in the social returns of these jobs and our ability to afford them. The voters have responded by looking to cut expenses, and they've chosen state and local government employment as a target.
During the financial crisis, the prices of stocks, homes and other assets all fell, leaving the American public feeling less wealthy. In fact, the Federal Reserve reported last week that the crisis had erased almost two decades of accumulated prosperity for a typical family. The American economy and its financial system failed a giant stress test, at least when compared with previous expectations. Feeding the fears today are the crisis in the euro zone, the slowdown in China and political polarization at home.
In short, there is a prevailing sense that we are simply not as safe, financially speaking, as we used to be. The productive capacity of the economy may appear largely intact, but the perceived risk is significantly higher.
Should state and local government jobs be such a low priority? There is considerable disagreement on this issue, but voters in most states have hardly been screaming to have those fiscal decisions overturned. Indeed, voters in San Diego and San Jose, Calif., chose earlier this month to sharply reduce pension benefits of city workers. Clearly, the decline in perceived wealth has brought a new, hard-to-manage shift away from government investment.
In response, some people have moralized about this shift -- sometimes by telling voters they're stupid to let government shrink. But that kind of talk can lower public trust even further. First, we all need to understand the problem.
SIMPLY recreating those state and local government jobs, without making other significant and confidence-restoring changes, may not bring much prosperity. After all, if the public feels a basic need to take less risk and to invest less money, such tinkering with one part of government spending would only bring demands to make offsetting cuts somewhere else.
The slow cure for this problem is to allow asset prices, along with perceived wealth and trust, to return to or exceed the previous levels over time. Americans would then spend and invest more money, bolstering both aggregate demand and supply, and in both the private and public sectors. But the process would be cumbersome, partly because trust is more easily destroyed than restored.
Various policies that are being put on the table, including forms of fiscal and monetary stimulus, try to accelerate this repair process. They would all be likely to underperform, partly because the public, rightly or wrongly, doesn't see them as ways to rebuild confidence. We have become skeptical of our own macroeconomic authorities and abilities, and that, in turn, makes successful policy harder to pull off.
For instance, there is a good case to be made for monetary expansion, given the current low rate of inflation and high rate of unemployment. But if fear of inflation puts off the American public, such a policy will again underperform, relative to what we have learned in textbooks. There won't be a credible commitment to see the monetary stimulus through, as people panic that resulting inflation will be used to redistribute wealth. (Although Sweden and Switzerland have had effective monetary policies recently, both of those countries have especially high rates of trust in government.)
The American problem is a particularly strong spin on John Maynard Keynes's concept of ''animal spirits'' -- the human emotion that drives confidence. These days, however, it's often the government that is spooking Americans. Too much debate is focusing on textbook remedies, and not enough on just how much trust has been broken.
We often hear the argument that our government should borrow and spend more money because the real rate of return on government borrowing is so low, as evidenced by bond yields. Maybe, but those yields are low because alternative investments are perceived as so risky, and people want a haven for their money.
Should government double-down on these risks by borrowing more money and pursuing more investment? After all, such a policy is supposed to be self-validating because of the accompanying economic stimulus. But will it be seen that way? Will government protect us from the risks of its potential mistakes?
That's not an easy debate to settle here, but suffice it to say that without more trust, it won't happen on a large scale.
The reason that we aren't getting more expansionary macro policy is fundamental: a lack of trust. It's not an easy problem to fix, but the place to start is by recognizing it.

HEADLINE: The Snow Kings of Mexico

BYLINE: By PATRICK RADDEN KEEFE

 BODY:
One afternoon last August, at a hospital on the outskirts of Los Angeles, a former beauty queen named Emma Coronel gave birth to a pair of heiresses. The twins, who were delivered at 3:50 and 3:51, respectively, stand to inherit some share of a fortune that Forbes estimates is worth a billion dollars. Coronel's husband, who was not present for the birth, is a legendary tycoon who overcame a penurious rural childhood to establish a wildly successful multinational business. If Coronel elected to leave the entry for ''Father'' on the birth certificates blank, it was not because of any dispute over patrimony. More likely, she was just skittish about the fact that her husband, Joaquin Guzman, is the C.E.O. of Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, a man the Treasury Department recently described as the world's most powerful drug trafficker. Guzman's organization is responsible for as much as half of the illegal narcotics imported into the United States from Mexico each year; he may well be the most-wanted criminal in this post-Bin Laden world. But his bride is a U.S. citizen with no charges against her. So authorities could only watch as she bundled up her daughters and slipped back across the border to introduce them to their dad. 
Known as El Chapo for his short, stocky frame, Guzman is 55, which in narco-years is about 150. He is a quasi-mythical figure in Mexico, the subject of countless ballads, who has outlived enemies and accomplices alike, defying the implicit bargain of a life in the drug trade: that careers are glittering but brief and always terminate in prison or the grave. When Pablo Escobar was Chapo's age, he had been dead for more than a decade. In fact, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, Chapo sells more drugs today than Escobar did at the height of his career. To some extent, this success is easily explained: as Hillary Clinton acknowledged several years ago, America's ''insatiable demand for illegal drugs'' is what drives the clandestine industry. It's no accident that the world's biggest supplier of narcotics and the world's biggest consumer of narcotics just happen to be neighbors. ''Poor Mexico,'' its former president Porfirio Diaz is said to have remarked. ''So far from God and so close to the United States.''
The Sinaloa cartel can buy a kilo of cocaine in the highlands of Colombia or Peru for around $2,000, then watch it accrue value as it makes its way to market. In Mexico, that kilo fetches more than $10,000. Jump the border to the United States, and it could sell wholesale for $30,000. Break it down into grams to distribute retail, and that same kilo sells for upward of $100,000 -- more than its weight in gold. And that's just cocaine. Alone among the Mexican cartels, Sinaloa is both diversified and vertically integrated, producing and exporting marijuana, heroin and methamphetamine as well.
Estimating the precise scale of Chapo's empire is tricky, however. Statistics on underground economies are inherently speculative: cartels don't make annual disclosures, and no auditor examines their books. Instead, we're left with back-of-the-envelope extrapolations based on conjectural data, much of it supplied by government agencies that may have bureaucratic incentives to overplay the problem.
So in a spirit of empirical humility, we shouldn't accept as gospel the estimate, from the Justice Department, that Colombian and Mexican cartels reap $18 billion to $39 billion from drug sales in the United States each year. (That range alone should give you pause.) Still, even if you take the lowest available numbers, Sinaloa emerges as a titanic player in the global black market. In the sober reckoning of the RAND Corporation, for instance, the gross revenue that all Mexican cartels derive from exporting drugs to the United States amounts to only $6.6 billion. By most estimates, though, Sinaloa has achieved a market share of at least 40 percent and perhaps as much as 60 percent, which means that Chapo Guzman's organization would appear to enjoy annual revenues of some $3 billion -- comparable in terms of earnings to Netflix or, for that matter, to Facebook.
The drug war in Mexico has claimed more than 50,000 lives since 2006. But what tends to get lost amid coverage of this epic bloodletting is just how effective the drug business has become. A close study of the Sinaloa cartel, based on thousands of pages of trial records and dozens of interviews with convicted drug traffickers and current and former officials in Mexico and the United States, reveals an operation that is global (it is active in more than a dozen countries) yet also very nimble and, above all, staggeringly complex. Sinaloa didn't merely survive the recession -- it has thrived in recent years. And after prevailing in some recent mass-casualty clashes, it now controls more territory along the border than ever.
''Chapo always talks about the drug business, wherever he is,'' one erstwhile confidant told a jury several years ago, describing a driven, even obsessive entrepreneur with a proclivity for micromanagement. From the remote mountain redoubt where he is believed to be hiding, surrounded at all times by a battery of gunmen, Chapo oversees a logistical network that is as sophisticated, in some ways, as that of Amazon or U.P.S. -- doubly sophisticated, when you think about it, because traffickers must move both their product and their profits in secret, and constantly maneuver to avoid death or arrest. As a mirror image of a legal commodities business, the Sinaloa cartel brings to mind that old line about Ginger Rogers doing all the same moves as Fred Astaire, only backward and in heels. In its longevity, profitability and scope, it might be the most successful criminal enterprise in history.
The state of Sinaloa, from which the cartel derives its name, lies wedged between the Sierra Madre Occidental and Mexico's west coast. Sun-blasted and remote, Sinaloa is the Sicily of Mexico, both cradle and refuge of violent men, and the ancestral land of many of the country's most notorious traffickers. Chapo was born in a village called La Tuna, in the foothills of the Sierra, in 1957. His formal education ended in third grade, and as an adult, he has reportedly struggled to read and write, prevailing upon a ghostwriter, at one point, to compose letters to his mistress. Little is known about Chapo's early years, but by the 1980s, he joined the Guadalajara cartel, which was run by a former policeman known as El Padrino -- the Godfather.
For decades, Mexican smugglers had exported homegrown marijuana and heroin to the United States. But as the Colombian cocaine boom gathered momentum in the 1980s and U.S. law enforcement began patrolling the Caribbean, the Colombians went in search of an alternate route to the United States and discovered one in Mexico. Initially, Mexican traffickers, like a pudgy 25-year-old airplane pilot named Miguel Angel Martinez, acted as independent contractors who were paid a fee by the Colombians to move their cargo. In 1986, the Guadalajara cartel dispatched Martinez to the Colombian port of Barranquilla, in the hope that someone might commission him to fly drugs up to Mexico. But Martinez couldn't find any takers and ended up languishing in Colombia for months, worrying that he had blown his big opportunity with the cartel. Eventually, he caught a commercial flight back to Mexico, and shortly thereafter, he was summoned to a meeting with Chapo, who was by then an underboss in the cartel. ''You were very well behaved in Colombia,'' Chapo told him, according to subsequent testimony. He seemed impressed by Martinez's patience in waiting for an assignment.
Having passed this test, Martinez started working for Chapo as a kind of air traffic controller, negotiating directly with the Cali and Medellin cartels, then guiding their cocaine flights from South America to secret runways in barren stretches of Mexico. Martinez knew U.S. agents were monitoring his radio communications, so rather than say a word, he would whistle -- a signal to the pilots that they were cleared for takeoff.
With the decline of the Caribbean route, the Colombians started paying Mexican smugglers not in cash but in cocaine. More than any other factor, it was this transition that realigned the power dynamics along the narcotics supply chain in the Americas, because it allowed the Mexicans to stop serving as logistical middlemen and invest in their own drugs instead. In 1986, Martinez couldn't land a gig as a lowly courier in Barranquilla. Not five years later, he was marshaling hundreds of flights laden with cocaine for Chapo. ''Sometimes we would get five planes a night,'' he remembered. ''Sometimes 16.'' Now it was the Colombians who went hat in hand to Chapo, looking not to hire him to move their product but to sell it to him outright. They would tip Martinez $25,000 just to get an audience with the man.
The young pilot became a gatekeeper to the ascendant kingpin, fielding his phone calls and accompanying him on foreign trips. There's a vaudevillian goofiness to nicknames in Mexico, and the stout Martinez was known in the cartel as El Gordo. He and Chapo -- Fatty and Shorty -- made quite a pair. ''Japan, Hong Kong, India, all of Europe,'' Martinez recalled in testimony. Chapo owned a fleet of Learjets, and together, they saw ''the whole world.'' They both used cocaine as well, a habit that Chapo would eventually give up. When a lawyer inquired, years later, whether he had been Chapo's right-hand man, Martinez replied that he might have been, but that Guzman had five left hands and five right hands. ''He's an octopus, Chapo Guzman,'' he said. For his efforts, Martinez was paid a million dollars a year, in a single annual installment: ''In cash, in a suitcase, each December.'' When Martinez's son was born, Chapo asked to serve as godfather.
In 1989, Chapo's mentor, El Padrino, was captured by Mexican authorities, and the remaining members of the Guadalajara cartel assembled in Acapulco to determine which smuggling route each capo would inherit. According to Ioan Grillo's book, ''El Narco,'' the meeting was ostensibly a gathering of friends. But the shards of El Padrino's organization would become the basis for the Tijuana, Juarez and Sinaloa cartels, and these onetime colleagues would soon become antagonists in a cycle of bloody turf wars that continues to this day.
''Drug cartel,'' it turns out, is a whopper of a misnomer; neither the Mexicans nor the Colombians ever colluded to fix prices or supply. ''I wish they were cartels,'' Arturo Sarukhan, Mexico's ambassador in Washington, told me. ''If they were, they wouldn't be fighting and driving up the violence.''
At first, Chapo's organization controlled a single smuggling route, through western Mexico into Arizona. But by 1990, it was moving three tons of cocaine each month over the border, and from there, to Los Angeles. The Sinaloa has always distinguished itself by the eclectic means it uses to transport drugs. Working with Colombian suppliers, cartel operatives moved cocaine into Mexico in small private aircraft and in baggage smuggled on commercial flights and eventually on their own 747s, which they could load with as much as 13 tons of cocaine. They used container ships and fishing vessels and go-fast boats and submarines -- crude semi-submersibles at first, then fully submersible subs, conceived by engineers and constructed under the canopy of the Amazon, then floated downriver in pieces and assembled at the coastline. These vessels can cost more than a million dollars, but to the smugglers, they are effectively disposable. In the event of an interception by the Coast Guard, someone onboard pulls a lever that floods the interior so that the evidence sinks; only the crew is left bobbing in the water, waiting to be picked up by the authorities.
Moving cocaine is a capital-intensive business, but the cartel subsidizes these investments with a ready source of easy income: marijuana. Cannabis is often described as the ''cash crop'' of Mexican cartels because it grows abundantly in the Sierras and requires no processing. But it's bulkier than cocaine, and smellier, which makes it difficult to conceal. So marijuana tends to cross the border far from official ports of entry. The cartel makes sandbag bridges to ford the Colorado River and sends buggies loaded with weed bouncing over the Imperial Sand Dunes into California. Michael Braun, the former chief of operations for the D.E.A., told me a story about the construction of a high-tech fence along a stretch of border in Arizona. ''They erect this fence,'' he said, ''only to go out there a few days later and discover that these guys have a catapult, and they're flinging hundred-pound bales of marijuana over to the other side.'' He paused and looked at me for a second. ''A catapult,'' he repeated. ''We've got the best fence money can buy, and they counter us with a 2,500-year-old technology.''
Improvisation is a trafficker's greatest asset, and in recent years, Sinaloa has devised an even more efficient solution to the perennial challenge of getting marijuana across the border. Grow it here. Several years ago, a hunter was trekking through the remote North Woods of Wisconsin when he stumbled upon a vast irrigated grow site, tended by a dozen Mexican farmers armed with AK-47's. According to the D.E.A., it was a Sinaloa pot farm, established on U.S. National Forest land to supply the market in Chicago.
Heroin is easier to smuggle but difficult to produce, and as detailed in court documents, Chapo is particularly proud of his organization's work with the drug. He personally negotiates shipments to the United States and stands by its quality, which is normally 94 percent pure. ''The value-to-weight ratio of heroin is better than any other drug,'' says Alejandro Hope, who until recently was a senior officer at Cisen, Mexico's equivalent to the C.I.A.
But the future of the business may be methamphetamine. During the 1990s, when the market for meth exploded in the United States, new regulations made it more difficult to manufacture large quantities of the drug in this country. This presented an opportunity that the Sinaloa quickly exploited. According to Anabel Hernandez, author of ''Los Senores del Narco,'' a book about the cartel, it was one of Chapo's deputies, a trafficker named Ignacio (Nacho) Coronel, who first spotted the massive potential of methamphetamine. ''Nacho was like Steve Jobs,'' Hernandez told me. ''He saw the future.''
Here was a drug that was ragingly addictive and could be produced cheaply and smuggled with relative ease. When they first started manufacturing meth, the Sinaloa would provide free samples to their existing wholesale clients in the Midwest. ''They'd send five hundred pounds of marijuana, and secreted in that would be two kilos of meth,'' Jack Riley, the D.E.A.'s special agent in charge of the Chicago office, told me. ''They'd give it away for free. They wanted the market.'' As demand grew, the cartel constructed superlabs, capable of churning out industrial volumes of meth. Container ships from India and China unloaded precursor chemicals -- largely ephedrine -- in the Pacific ports Lazaro Cardenas and Manzanillo. To grasp the scale of production, consider the volume of some recent precursor seizures at these ports: 22 tons in October 2009; 88 tons in May 2010; 252 tons last December. When Mexico banned the importation of ephedrine, the cartel adapted, tweaking its recipe to use unregulated precursors. Recently they have started outsourcing production to new labs in Guatemala.
But Chapo's greatest contribution to the evolving tradecraft of drug trafficking was one of those innovations that seem so logical in hindsight it's a wonder nobody thought of it before: a tunnel. In the late 1980s, Chapo hired an architect to design an underground passageway from Mexico to the United States. What appeared to be a water faucet outside the home of a cartel attorney in the border town of Agua Prieta was in fact a secret lever that, when twisted, activated a hydraulic system that opened a hidden trapdoor underneath a pool table inside the house. The passage ran more than 200 feet, directly beneath the fortifications along the border, and emerged inside a warehouse the cartel owned in Douglas, Ariz. Chapo pronounced it ''cool.''
When this new route was complete, Chapo instructed Martinez to call the Colombians. ''Tell them to send all the drugs they can,'' he said. As the deliveries multiplied, Sinaloa acquired a reputation for the miraculous speed with which it could push inventory across the border. ''Before the planes were arriving back in Colombia on the return, the cocaine was already in Los Angeles,'' Martinez marveled.
Eventually the tunnel was discovered, so Chapo shifted tactics once again, this time by going into the chili-pepper business. He opened a cannery in Guadalajara and began producing thousands of cans stamped ''Comadre Jalapenos,'' stuffing them with cocaine, then vacuum-sealing them and shipping them to Mexican-owned grocery stores in California. He sent drugs in the refrigeration units of tractor-trailers, in custom-made cavities in the bodies of cars and in truckloads of fish (which inspectors at a sweltering checkpoint might not want to detain for long). He sent drugs across the border on freight trains, to cartel warehouses in Los Angeles and Chicago, where rail spurs let the cars roll directly inside to unload. He sent drugs via FedEx.
But that tunnel into Douglas remains Chapo's masterpiece, an emblem of his creative ingenuity. Twenty years on, the cartels are still burrowing under the border -- more than a hundred tunnels have been discovered in the years since Chapo's first. They are often ventilated and air-conditioned, and some feature trolley lines stretching up to a half-mile to accommodate the tonnage in transit.
You might suppose that a certain recklessness would be a prerequisite for anyone contemplating a career in the drug trade. But in reality, blue-chip traffickers tend to fixate, with neurotic intensity, on the concept of risk. ''The goal of these folks is not to sell drugs,'' Tony Placido, who was the top intelligence official at the D.E.A. until he retired last year, told me. ''It's to earn a spendable profit and live to enjoy it.'' So the smart narcos are preoccupied with what Peter Reuter and Mark Kleiman once referred to, in a classic essay on the drug business, as ''the marginal imprisonment risk.'' In 2010, Chapo's old friend Ismael (El Mayo) Zambada, the No. 2 man in the Sinaloa cartel, granted an interview to the Mexican magazine Proceso. Now in his 60s and a grandfather, El Mayo has been in the drug business for nearly half a century and has amassed a fortune. But you can't buy peace of mind. ''I'm terrified they'll incarcerate me,'' he acknowledged. ''I'm full of fear. Always.''
There's a reason coke and heroin cost so much more on the street than at the farm gate: you're not paying for the drugs; you're compensating everyone along the distribution chain for the risks they assumed in getting them to you. Smugglers often negotiate, in actuarial detail, about who will be held liable in the event of lost inventory. After a bust, arrested traffickers have been known to demand a receipt from authorities, so that they can prove the loss was not because of their own negligence (which would mean they might have to pay for it) or their own thievery (which would mean they might have to die). Some Colombian cartels have actually offered insurance policies on narcotics, as a safeguard against loss or seizure.
To prevent catastrophic losses, cartels tend to distribute their risk as much as possible. Before sending a 100-kilo shipment across the border, traffickers might disaggregate it into five carloads of 20 kilos each. Chapo and his associates further reduce their personal exposure by going in together on shipments, so each of those smaller carloads might hold 10 kilos belonging to Chapo and 10 belonging to Mayo Zambada. The Sinaloa is occasionally called the Federation because senior figures and their subsidiaries operate semiautonomously while still employing a common smuggling apparatus.
The organizational structure of the cartel also seems fashioned to protect the leadership. No one knows how many people work for Sinaloa, and the range of estimates is comically broad. Malcolm Beith, the author of a recent book about Chapo, posits that at any given moment, the drug lord may have 150,000 people working for him. John Bailey, a Georgetown professor who has studied the cartel, says that the number of actual employees could be as low as 150. The way to account for this disparity is to distinguish between salaried employees and subcontractors. A labor force of thousands may be required to plow all that contraband up the continent, but a lot of the work can be delegated to independent contractors, people the Mexican political scientist and security consultant Eduardo Guerrero describes as working ''for the cartel but outside it.''
Even those who do work directly for the cartel are limited to carefully compartmentalized roles. At a recent trial, a regional cartel lieutenant, Jose Esparza, testified about his experience working for the Sinaloa along the border. On one occasion, he attended a meeting outside Culiacan with many of the cartel's top leaders. But there was no sign of Chapo. Once the discussion concluded, an emissary left the group and approached a Hummer that was parked in the distance and surrounded by men with bulletproof vests and machine guns, to report on the proceedings. Chapo never stepped out of the vehicle.
It's not just the federales that the narcos fear; it's also one another. The brutal opportunism of the underworld economy means that most partnerships are temporary, and treachery abounds. For decades, Chapo worked closely with his childhood friend Arturo Beltran Leyva, a fearsome trafficker who ran a profitable subsidiary of Sinaloa. But in 2008, the two men split, then went to war, and Beltran Leyva's assassins were later blamed for murdering one of Chapo's sons. To reduce the likelihood of clashes like these, the cartel has revived an unlikely custom: the ancient art of dynastic marriage. Chapo's organization is occasionally referred to as an alianza de sangre (''alliance of blood''), because so many of its prominent members are cousins by marriage or brothers-in-law. Emma Coronel, who gave birth to Chapo's twins, is the niece of Nacho Coronel, the Steve Jobs of meth (who died in a shootout with the Mexican Army in 2010). All of this intermarriage, one U.S. official in Mexico suggested to me, functions as ''a hedge against distrust.'' An associate may be less likely to cheat you, or to murder you, if there'll be hell to pay with his wife. It's a cynical strategy, certainly, but in a vocation where one of Chapo's rivals went by the nickname Mata Amigos, or ''Friend Killer,'' it may also be quite sound.
The surest way to stay out of trouble in the drug business is to dole out bribes, and promiscuously. Drug cartels don't pay corporate taxes, but a colossus like Sinaloa makes regular payments to the federal, state and municipal authorities that may well rival the effective tax rate in Mexico. When the D.E.A. conducted an internal survey of its top 50 operatives and informants several years ago and asked them to name the most important factor for running a drug business, they replied, overwhelmingly, corruption. At a trial in 2010, a former police official from Juarez, Jesus Fierro Mendez, acknowledged that he had worked for Sinaloa. ''Did the drug cartels have the police on the payroll?'' an attorney asked.
''All of it,'' Fierro Mendez replied.
The cartel bribes mayors and prosecutors and governors, state police and federal police, the army, the navy and a host of senior officials at the national level. After an arrest for drug trafficking in the 1990s, Chapo was sentenced to 20 years and shipped to Puente Grande, a fortified prison in Jalisco that was Mexico's answer to a supermax. But during the five years he spent there, Chapo enjoyed prerogatives that make the prison sequence in ''Goodfellas'' look positively austere. With most of the facility on his payroll, he is said to have ordered his meals from a menu, conducted business by cellphone and orchestrated periodic visits by prostitutes, who would arrive aboard a prison truck driven by a guard. I spoke with one drug producer who negotiated a joint venture deal with Chapo while he was behind bars. Eventually, as the story goes, Chapo was smuggled out in a laundry cart. According to Martinez's testimony, he paid more than $3 million to secure his release. Today, Chapo is a free man, Puente Grande's warden only recently completed a jail sentence for letting him go and Mexicans call the prison Puerta Grande -- the Big Door.
The tacit but unwavering tolerance that Mexican authorities have shown for the drug trade over the years has muddled the boundaries between outlaws and officials. When Miguel Angel Martinez was working for Chapo, he says, ''everyone'' in the organization had military and police identification. Daylight killings are sometimes carried out by men dressed in police uniforms, and it is not always clear, after the fact, whether the perpetrators were thugs masquerading as policemen or actual policemen providing paid assistance to the thugs. On those occasions when the government scores a big arrest, meanwhile, police and military officials pose for photos at the valedictory news conference brandishing assault weapons, their faces shrouded in ski masks, to shield their identities. In the trippy semiotics of the drug war, the cops dress like bandits, and the bandits dress like cops.
When you tally it all up, bribery may be the single largest line item on a cartel's balance sheet. In 2008, President Felipe Calderon's own drug czar, Noe Ramirez, was charged with accepting $450,000 each month. Presumably, such gargantuan bribes to senior officials cascade down, securing the allegiance of their subordinates. ''You have to recruit the high commands, so they can issue the information to lower ranks and order whatever they want,'' the corrupt cop, Fierro Mendez, testified. But in key jurisdictions, the cartel most likely makes payments up and down the chain of command. In a 2010 speech, Genaro Garcia Luna, Mexico's secretary of public security, speculated that together, the cartels spend more than a billion dollars each year just to bribe the municipal police.
It's not only officials who must be bribed, either. There are also the ''falcons,'' an army of civilian lookouts who might receive $100 a month just to keep their eyes open and make a phone call if they notice an uptick in border inspections or a convoy of police. ''There are cities in Mexico where virtually every cabdriver is on the payroll,'' Michael Braun, formerly of the D.E.A., said. ''They have eyes and ears everywhere.''
And then there are the Americans. Guards at the U.S. border have been known to wave a car through their checkpoints for a few thousand dollars, and since 2004, there have been 138 convictions or indictments in corruption investigations involving members of the United States Customs and Border Protection. Paradoxically, one explanation for this state of affairs is the rapid expansion of border forces following the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. In their hurry to fortify the U.S.-Mexico boundary with uniformed personnel, it seems, officials may have made allowances on background checks and screenings. In some instances, job offers have been extended to the immediate relatives of known traffickers.
When corruption fails, there is always violence. During the 12 years that he worked for the cartel, Martinez claims that he did not carry a gun. But Sinaloa has risen to pre-eminence as much through savagery as through savvy. ''In illegal markets, the natural tendency is toward monopoly, so they fight each other,'' Antonio Mazzitelli, an official with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in Mexico City, told me. ''How do they fight: Go to court? Offer better prices? No. They use violence.'' The primal horror of Mexico's murder epidemic makes it difficult, perhaps even distasteful, to construe the cartel's butchery as a rational advancement of coherent business aims. But the reality is that in a multibillion-dollar industry in which there is no recourse to legally enforceable contracts, some degree of violence may be inevitable.
''It's like geopolitics,'' Tony Placido said. ''You need to use violence frequently enough that the threat is believable. But overuse it, and it's bad for business.''
The most gratuitous practitioners of violence right now would be the Zetas, a rampaging league of sociopaths with a notable devotion to physical cruelty. The Zetas are a new kind of cartel, in that they came somewhat late to the actual business of smuggling drugs. They started out as bodyguards for the Gulf Cartel before going into business for themselves, and they specialize in messaging through bloodshed. It's the Zetas who are charged with dumping 49 mutilated bodies by the side of a highway near Monterrey last month. Sinaloa is responsible for a great deal of carnage as well, but its approach to killing has traditionally been more discreet. Whereas a Sinaloa subsidiary allied with a Tijuana farmer known as the Stewmaker, who dissolved hundreds of bodies in barrels of lye, the Zetas have pioneered a multimedia approach to violence, touting their killings on YouTube. One strategic choice facing any cartel is deciding when to intimidate the civilian population and when to cultivate it. Sinaloa can be exceedingly brutal, but the cartel is more pragmatic than the Zetas in its deployment of violence. It may simply be, as one Obama administration official suggested, that the Sinaloa leadership is ''more conscious of their brand.''
It's a curious rivalry between these two organizations, because their business models are really very different. The Zetas have diversified beyond drugs to extortion, kidnapping and human trafficking, blossoming into what officials call a ''polycriminal organization.'' Sinaloa, by contrast, has mostly tended to stick to its core competence of trafficking. According to one captured cartel member, Chapo specifically instructed his subordinates not to dabble in protection rackets and insisted that Sinaloa territory remain ''calm'' and ''controlled.''
''Sinaloa does not do extortion directly,'' Eduardo Guerrero said. ''It's so risky, and the profits are so small. They want the big business -- and the big business is in the United States.''
Just how active the cartel is north of the border is a divisive question. According to the Department of Justice, by 2009, Mexican-based criminal organizations were operating in ''more than a thousand U.S. cities.'' When you consider the huge jump in the price of narcotics between bulk importation and retail sales, it might seem that Chapo would want to expand into street-level distribution. In 2005, the D.E.A. began intercepting large shipments of cocaine in which each kilo brick was heat-sealed in a distinctive Mylar foil. They spotted the foil in Los Angeles first, then in Oklahoma, Chicago, Atlanta and New Jersey. ''This was Sinaloa coke,'' Michael Wardrop, who led two of the agency's most ambitious operations against the domestic networks of the cartel, told me. As the telltale wrapping popped up across the country, Wardrop and his colleagues marveled at the sheer expanse of Sinaloa's market. ''It was like watching a virus in a Petri dish,'' he said. ''It was constantly growing.''
Wardrop's investigations netted more than a thousand arrests. But some observers question the extent to which the perpetrators in these cases were actually working for the cartel. ''If you're telling me there's a straight chain of command back to El Chapo in Sinaloa -- come on, that's absurd,'' the Mexican ambassador, Arturo Sarukhan, protested. Often, the gatekeepers and logistics men that the D.E.A. arrested were indeed connected to handlers in Mexico. But this was more true of high-level importers dealing in kilos than run-of-the-mill retailers pushing grams. When The Associated Press tracked down Otis Rich, a Baltimore dealer who was ensnared in one of the operations, he answered the obvious question with a telling reply: ''Sina-who?''
''The fully integrated model would indeed maximize profits,'' John Bailey observes in a coming book about the cartels, but ''it also maximizes risk of exposure.'' A big reason for the markup at the retail level is that the sales force is so exposed -- out on the corner, a magnet for undercover cops, obliged to negotiate with a needy, unpredictable clientele. When you adjust for all that added risk, the windfall starts to seem less alluring. Like a liquor wholesaler who opts not to open a bar, Chapo appears to have decided that the profits associated with retail sales just aren't worth the hassle.
What Sinaloa does do inside this country is ferry drugs along highways to regional distribution hubs, where they are turned over to trusted wholesalers, like the Flores twins of Chicago. Pedro and Margarito Flores grew up in a Mexican-American enclave of the city during the 1990s. Their father and an older brother had moved drugs for Sinaloa, and by the time the twins were in their 20s, they had gone into business as distributors, purchasing cocaine and heroin directly from Mexican cartels, then selling to dealers throughout the United States. Chicago, home of the Mercantile Exchange, has always been a hub from which legitimate goods fan out across the country, and it's no different for black-market commodities. Chapo has used the city as a clearinghouse since the early 1990s; he once described it as his ''home port.''
In 2005, the Flores twins were flown to a mountaintop compound in Sinaloa to meet with Chapo Guzman. The kingpin is an intimidating interlocutor; one criminal who has negotiated with him face to face told me that Chapo tends to dominate a conversation, asking a lot of questions and compensating for his short stature by bouncing on the balls of his feet. But the meeting went well, and before long, the brothers were distributing around two tons of Sinaloa product each month. As preferred customers, they often took Chapo's drugs without putting any money down, then paid the cartel only after they sold the product. This might seem unlikely, given the pervasive distrust in the underworld, but the narcotics trade is based on a robust and surprisingly reliable system of credit. In a sense, a cartel like Sinaloa has no choice but to offer a financing option, because few wholesale buyers have the liquidity to pay cash upfront for a ton of cocaine. ''They have to offer lines of credit,'' Wardrop told me, ''no different from Walmart or Sears.''
This credit system, known as ''fronting,'' rests on an ironclad assumption that in the American marketplace, even an idiot salesman should have no trouble selling drugs. One convicted Sinaloa trafficker told me that it often took him more time to count the money he collected from his customers than it did to actually move the product. It may also help that the penalty for defaulting could involve dismemberment.
As wholesale buyers, the Flores brothers occupied a crucial bottleneck between the cartel and its consumers. They grew so indispensable, in fact, that after taking delivery of a shipment of drugs, they could retroactively bargain down the price. One day in 2008, Pedro Flores telephoned Guzman in Mexico to ask for a discount on heroin.
''What did we agree on?'' Chapo asked him, according to a government transcript of the call.
They had negotiated a price of $55,000 per kilo, Flores explained. But if Chapo would consider lowering that to $50,000, the twins could pay immediately.
''That price is fine,'' Chapo agreed, without argument. Then he added something significant: ''Do you have a way to bring that money over here?''
For the Sinaloa cartel, pushing product north into the United States is only half the logistical equation. The drug trade is a cash business -- you can't buy kilos with your credit card. So while politicians tend to focus on cartels primarily as importers of drugs, the narcos also devote an enormous amount of energy to the export of money. Cash is collected in small denominations from individual buyers and then bundled in great stacks of broken-in bills that are used to pay wholesalers, like the Flores brothers. These bills are counted, hidden in the same vehicle compartments that were used to smuggle drugs in the opposite direction and then sent to stash houses in Los Angeles, San Diego and Phoenix. From there, they move across the border into Mexico.
What happens to the money when it gets there? The cartel employs professional money launderers who specialize in drug proceeds, and according to Robert Mazur, a former D.E.A. agent who infiltrated the Colombian cartels, the fee for fully scrubbing and banking illicit proceeds may run Sinaloa more than 15 cents on the dollar. But a great deal of the cartel's money remains in cash. In the early 1990s, a Sinaloa accountant sent planeloads of U.S. currency to Mexico City in suitcases holding $1 million each. When Miguel Angel Martinez worked for Chapo, the kingpin would test his loyalty, adding an extra $200,000 to one of the suitcases to see if Martinez would pocket it. ''Eight suitcases, compadre, so that is $8 million,'' he would say. (Martinez never fell for the trick.) A sizable share of the cash is devoted to paying bribes, and some is sent to Colombia to purchase more product, because drugs offer a strong return on investment. ''Where would you put your money?'' the former Cisen officer Alejandro Hope asked me with a chuckle. ''T-bills? Real estate? I would put a large portion of my portfolio in cocaine.''
Even so, the business generates such volumes of currency that there is only so much you can launder or reinvest, which means that money can start to pile up around the house. The most that Martinez ever saw at one time was $30 million, which just sat there, having accumulated in his living room. In 2007, Mexican authorities raided the home of Zhenli Ye Gon, a Chinese-Mexican businessman who is believed to have supplied meth-precursor chemicals to the cartel, and discovered $206 million, the largest cash seizure in history. And that was the money Zhenli held onto -- he was an inveterate gambler, who once blew so much cash in Las Vegas that one of the casinos presented him, in consolation, with a Rolls-Royce. ''How much money do you have to lose in the casino for them to give you a Rolls-Royce?'' Tony Placido, the D.E.A. intelligence official, asked. (The astonishing answer, in Zhenli's case, is $72 million at a single casino in a single year.) Placido also pointed out that, as a precursor guy, Zhenli was on the low end of the value chain for meth. It makes you wonder about the net worth of the guy who runs the whole show.
In 2008, the Flores twins were indicted in Chicago and began secretly cooperating with law enforcement. The following year, one of their Sinaloa contacts -- a debonair young trafficker named Jesus Vicente Zambada Niebla, or Vicentillo -- was arrested in Mexico and later extradited to Chicago. He will be the highest-ranking member of the cartel ever to face trial in the United States, and his favorite wholesale customers will be the star witnesses against him. In a surprise twist, Vicentillo (who is the son of Chapo's partner, Mayo Zambada) has argued that he can't be prosecuted -- because even as he worked for Sinaloa, he was also a secret informant for the D.E.A.
There has been speculation in Mexico that the Calderon regime favors Sinaloa over the unhinged Zetas and has made a devil's pact to lay off the cartel. It might be impossible to eradicate all the cartels in Mexico, this theory goes, so the government has picked a favorite in the conflict in the hope that when the smoke clears, a Sinaloa monopoly might usher in a sort of pax narcotica. A 2010 National Public Radio investigation of Mexican arrest statistics found that Sinaloa had suffered conspicuously fewer arrests than had its peers, though this could simply be evidence of triage on the government's part rather than proof of a conspiracy. Calderon vehemently denies any charges of favoritism, and his administration has arrested or killed several of Chapo's key deputies in the last few years. (My repeated requests for interviews with relevant officials in Mexico were denied.)
The suggestion that the D.E.A. might have made a deal with a high-ranking Sinaloa figure is new, however. In the past, Chapo has occasionally authorized employees to provide information to American law enforcement. Fierro Mendez, the Juarez cop, described a system in which junior traffickers would walk into U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and announce their willingness to become informers -- then feed the Americans intelligence about rival cartels, thereby using law enforcement to eliminate their competitors. U.S. officials allow that there were discussions between the D.E.A. and Vicentillo, but they deny that any quid pro quo was in place.
The trial, which is scheduled for October, should shed significant light on Sinaloa's logistical apparatus -- provided the witnesses can stay alive until then. Recently, a career criminal named Saul Rodriguez testified that Vicentillo solicited his help at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Chicago, where they were both being held, in an effort to have the Flores twins assassinated. Authorities have expressed concern that the cartel might undertake a daring jailbreak to get Vicentillo out. They have also voiced the opposite worry -- that Vicentillo will himself be killed. A request by the trafficker's attorneys that he be permitted to exercise outdoors raised concerns from prison officials, because the only open space at the prison is a fenced-in recreation area on top of the building, where Vicentillo could be picked off by a sniper. (He has since been moved to a more secure facility.)
It might seem far-fetched that the cartel would try to assassinate one of its own, the son of Mayo Zambada, no less. But Sinaloa guards its secrets ruthlessly. After Chapo's friend Miguel Angel Martinez was arrested in 1998, four men came to kill him in prison, stabbing him repeatedly. In that assault, and another that followed, he sustained more than a dozen stab wounds, which punctured his lungs, pancreas and intestines. After the second attack, he was moved to another facility and kept in a segregated unit. This time, an assassin managed to get as far as the gate outside Martinez's cell and chucked two grenades at the bars. Locked in with nowhere to run, Martinez could only cower by the toilet to shield himself from the blast. The roof caved in, and he barely survived. Asked later who it was that tried to have him killed, Martinez said that it was his compadre, Chapo Guzman. ''Because of what I knew,'' he explained. (Today he is living in witness protection in the United States.)
Between the coming trial and the increased political drumbeat on both sides of the border for his capture, Chapo may be more embattled today than at any time in his career. In February, he escaped a raid by Mexican authorities in the resort area of Los Cabos. President Calderon's party is trailing in the polls, and some have theorized that the only way it might manage to retain power after next month's presidential election would be if Chapo is killed or captured. U.S. authorities, meanwhile, are uncertain about who might succeed Calderon -- Vice President Joe Biden met with all of the leading candidates on a visit to Mexico in March -- and whether that successor will have any appetite to continue battling the cartels. With so many dead and so little progress, the Mexican populace has grown war-weary. Several U.S. officials told me that the critical window for capturing Chapo is between now and when Calderon leaves office.
In addition to the threat of capture, there is the threat of competition. By some estimates, the Zetas now control more Mexican territory than Chapo does, even if they don't move nearly as many drugs. Zeta gunmen have made bloody incursions on Chapo's turf, going so far as to penetrate the previously inviolable stronghold of his own home state, Sinaloa. In 2008, Chapo's lover, Zulema Hernandez, was discovered dead in the trunk of a car, her body carved with the letter ''Z.'' ''It's like the evolution of the dinosaurs, and the coming of the T. Rex,'' Antonio Mazzitelli told me. ''The T. Rex is the Zetas.''
Chapo and his colleagues were never peaceful types; in the last few years, they have waged vicious wars of acquisition to seize the lucrative smuggling routes through Juarez and Tijuana. But to fend off the Zetas, Sinaloa is resorting to new levels of barbarism. In March, the cartel dumped a collection of dismembered bodies in Zeta territory and posted a series of open letters on the walls around them, deriding the Zetas as ''a bunch of drunks and car-washers.'' Each message was signed, ''Sincerely, El Chapo.''
One thing Chapo has always done is innovate. Even as he engages in violent brinkmanship along the border, the cartel is expanding to new markets in Europe, where a kilo of cocaine can sell for three times what it does in the U.S., and in Australia, where authorities believe that Chapo is now a major cocaine supplier. There are also indications that the cartel is exploring opportunities in Southeast Asia, China and Japan -- places Chapo and Martinez first visited as younger men. And Chapo's great comparative advantage still lies along that fraught boundary between Mexico and the United States. Even if the kingpin is killed or captured, one of his associates will quite likely take his place, and the smuggling infrastructure that Chapo created will endure, channeling the product, reaping the profits and feeding, with barely a blip in service, the enduring demand on this side of the border -- what the historian Hector Aguilar Camin once referred to as ''the insatiable North American nose.''

BYLINE: By KATHRYN SHATTUCK

 BODY:
11 P.M. (13) FLORENT: QUEEN OF THE MEAT MARKET (2011) David Sigal traces the trajectory of Restaurant Florent, a 24-hour diner-cum-bistro on Gansevoort Street in Manhattan's meatpacking district, from 1985, when it was the lone eatery in a shadowy industrial area, to 2008 when, after a successful run, it became a relic of a bohemian utopia in a quickly changing neighborhood. The film also chronicles the life of the restaurant's owner, Florent Morellet, above, a French expatriate, artist-cartographer and political activist who, after learning in 1987 that he was H.I.V. positive, disregarded the advice of friends and revealed his status, even keeping a running tabulation of his T-cell count on the restaurant's menu board. Writing in The New York Times, Stephen Holden called this film, which features appearances by Julianne Moore, Diane von Furstenberg, Isaac Mizrahi and Michael Musto, ''a touching, elegiac tale of the rise (and some would say fall) of a colorful New York neighborhood under the relentless march of gentrification.'' 
9 A.M. (CNN) STATE OF THE UNION WITH CANDY CROWLEY Ms. Crowley interviews David Plouffe, a senior adviser to President Obama, about the administration's plan to turn around the economy. She also speaks with Rick Santorum, a former Republican presidential candidate, about the conservative agenda. Later in the morning, Mr. Plouffe appears on ''Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace,'' at 10; on ''This Week With George Stephanopoulos,'' at 10 on ABC; and on ''Meet the Press,'' on NBC at 10:30.
10:30 A.M. (CBS) FACE THE NATION Bob Schieffer interviews the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney.
2:30 P.M. (Starz) ANONYMOUS (2011) In this costume spectacle directed by Roland Emmerich, Rhys Ifans, below, portrays Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, who writes politically controversial plays -- the better to extend some behind-the-scenes influence over the affairs of state -- and then claims they were written by a drunken, duplicitous and fame-courting actor named William Shakespeare (Rafe Spall). Blackmail ensues. Writing in The Times, A. O. Scott called this film, with a script from John Orloff, ''a vulgar prank on the English literary tradition, a travesty of British history and a brutal insult to the human imagination.'' Apart from that, he said, ''it's not bad.''
6 P.M. (13) MOYERS & COMPANY Bill Moyers speaks with the historian Thomas Frank about the power of money to subvert democracy and his recent book, ''Pity the Billionaire.'' He also speaks with Clara Jeffery and Monika Bauerlein of Mother Jones about what they call ''dark money'' given by super PAC donors, who are increasingly influential in swaying elections.
9 P.M. (Fuse) MUCHMUSIC VIDEO AWARDS 2012 LMFAO hosts this ceremony broadcast from Toronto. Flo Rida, Kelly Clarkson, Ed Sheeran, Justin Bieber and Nelly Furtado are scheduled to perform. Carly Rae Jepsen (''Call Me Maybe''); Down With Webster (''She's Dope''); Drake (''Headlines''); Hedley, featuring P. Reign (''Invincible''); and Marianas Trench (''Fallout'') are nominated for the video of the year. A red-carpet show will lead in at 8.
9 P.M. (TNT) FALLING SKIES Noah Wyle plays Tom Mason, a Boston University history professor whose life has been destroyed by an alien invasion of Earth in this series from DreamWorks Television, with Steven Spielberg among the executive producers. In this Season 2 premiere, Pope (Colin Cunningham) seizes command of a renegade contingent within the Second Mass unit, and Tom's loyalty is called into question when he rejoins the group.
9 P.M. (Showtime) NURSE JACKIE The season ends as Jackie (Edie Falco, below) is fired after Cruz (Haaz Sleiman) pushes her to her breaking point. Meanwhile, Dr. O'Hara (Eve Best) goes into labor. In the season finale of ''The Big C,'' at 9:30, Cathy (Laura Linney) befriends a mysterious stranger on her vacation in Puerto Rico, and Paul (Oliver Platt) is flattered by the attention of a tourist. And a tragic revelation leaves the family reeling at the season end of ''The Borgias,'' at 10.
9 P.M. (AMC) THE KILLING After two seasons and plenty of dead ends, Linden (Mireille Enos) and Holder (Joel Kinnaman) finally find out who killed Rosie Larsen.
10 P.M. (HBO) GIRLS As the first season ends, Hannah (Lena Dunham) starts to question her relationship with Adam (Adam Driver). Meanwhile, Jessa (Jemima Kirke) throws a mystery party at which Marnie (Allison Williams) embraces her free-spirited side, and Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet) discovers that it's a good thing that she is not like other young women.

HEADLINE: The Clown and the Cop

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

 BODY:
TRAPPED with a Fox News big screen in my stable of trotters at the gym a few weeks ago, I took in the worldview that may give the White House to Republicans this year. After burning 400 calories, I was ready to torch the capital.
For almost half an hour I heard another rehash of how my tax dollars were spent on a clown, a comic and a mind reader at a retreat for government workers outside Las Vegas in 2010. Those tin-eared bureaucrats in the General Services Administration spent a total of $835,000. An outrage, of course, and it was typical, I was informed, of runaway government spending under Barack Obama. 
Not mentioned during my face time with Fox was a defense bill passed by the House that same day authorizing $642 billion in spending next year -- almost $8 billion more than the Defense Department asked for. And this vote broke a promise by the Tea Party-backed Congress, when it agreed last year to cut military spending over 10 years.
Question: Which is more important, a bunch of clowns spending on a clown, for less than a million dollars, or a Congress that threw more than a thousand times that amount at things that are considered unnecessary -- outdated bases, pie-in-the-sky contractor schemes -- by the very people who are supposed to spend it?
The clown, clearly. Why? Because most people are unaware that the Republican majority, the same politicians who rode into office in 2010 on a pledge of not spending beyond our means, voted to run up the deficit last month on behalf of those parochial projects.
But nearly everyone knows about the clown, the comic and the mind reader. And to be fair to Fox, which is more than it is on any given day, the lamestream media has had plenty of stories about the Vegas debacle and very little on the padding for the Pentagon.
Elections are about narrative; as such, money and partisan reporting are vital to shaping a story line that moves a majority of voters. A central Republican message is that government spending is out of control under Obama, and most of those outlays are wasteful. Do the facts have a chance? Let's give it a try.
First, you have to go back to Dwight Eisenhower's administration, more than 50 years ago, to find a rate of federal spending growth lower than that of the Obama administration. This counterintuitive conclusion was reported last month by Rex Nutting in MarketWatch, a Web site affiliated with The Wall Street Journal. It's been labeled ''mostly true'' by the nonpartisan referee PolitiFact, though others have challenged the premise of the piece. Nutting took much of 2009 out of Obama's column because the spending was authorized in the last year of George W. Bush's presidency.
But even when he's tagged with most of 2009's outlays -- including the stimulus, which saved more than one million jobs -- Obama is a relative miser on the growth chart. Still, Mitt Romney continues to say that under Obama, federal spending ''has accelerated at a rate without precedent.'' Of course, Obama would like to spend more, and if given a free hand, may rise to a level justifying Romney's claim.
Which brings us to the second part of the argument, on the nature of government spending. Certainly, there are perennial abuses that feed public distrust. Not just the clown, but municipal workers who get outsize benefits. It erodes support for helping the poor when the director of the Los Angeles Housing Authority can get $260,000 a year in base salary.
But for every bureaucrat living in a McMansion while doling out vouchers for people in leaky trailers, there are honest cops, hardworking teachers, gutsy firefighters and tireless enforcers of laws that protect our air, water and public lands.
In Romney's view, these public servants are dishonorable, and maybe even less American. ''We have 145,000 more government workers under this president,'' Romney said in Colorado last month. ''Let's send them back home and put you back to work.''
Again, this is simply not true. Under Obama, public sector employment has fallen by more than 600,000 workers. Obama has tried to increase these rolls -- adding teachers, cops and firefighters under federal grants used for the last 50 years -- but has been stymied by a Congress that wants to end his presidency by sabotaging the economy. And so long as people believe government money is more likely to be spent on a clown instead of a cop, the Congress can act without consequence.
There's also the notion of ''send them home,'' as if these workers were some kind of foreign element in our midst. They are home, in the uniforms of their calling. Look around, and you'll see them in harm's way, rushing to wildfires in the West, strapping on bulletproof vests before going out in 100-degree heat, showing up at 6 a.m. to prepare the day's lessons for your kid.
Steve Jobs famously said in his 2005 Stanford commencement speech that ''Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.'' Similarly, presidential elections are too important to be guided by someone else's facts.

HEADLINE: Power Is Always in Vogue

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS; Cathy Horyn and Eric Wilson contributed reporting. Alan Delaqueriere contributed research.

 BODY:
WHEN Anna Wintour was in Paris for Fashion Week in March, there was one topic the Vogue editor couldn't stop talking about. And it had nothing to do with the winter collections.
Who was going to win the French presidential election in a few weeks, she wondered aloud to several seat mates in the front row.
Catch Ms. Wintour in New York today, and you might just get an earful about the crucial swing states for President Obama or the pitiful Spanish and Greek economies.
And don't even get her started on the international fabric trade. Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, recalled a conversation she had with Ms. Wintour on the subject. ''She said, 'You may not realize this, but the tariffs and the treaties we have in place fundamentally affect the ability to provide various goods to various markets at an affordable rate,' '' Senator Gillibrand said. 
After that meeting, Senator Gillibrand emerged from Vogue's offices high above Times Square with a list of stores and vendors that Ms. Wintour suggested she visit so she could better understand how trade affects businesses in the city.
For those who know Ms. Wintour only as the icy, inscrutable character obsessed over in the tabloids and satirized on film, it can be impossible to separate her from the fashion runways she terrorizes from behind those dark sunglasses. But she has emerged as something more: an engaged politico and valuable asset to President Obama and his re-election effort.
This is Ms. Wintour's second campaign working as an Obama bundler, those well-connected and highly motivated wranglers of cash for political candidates. Her latest effort for the president came on Thursday evening at a 50-person, $40,000-a-plate dinner she co-hosted at the West Village town house of Sarah Jessica Parker.
During a question-and-answer session with Mr. Obama, Ms. Wintour had command of the room. She called on Meryl Streep, who asked the president what he could do to attract more talented people to government jobs. (Though Ms. Streep professed she probably already knew: increase salaries.)
Michael Kors, the designer, asked about same-sex marriage. And Trey Laird, the advertising excecutive, wanted to know about tax policy. All the while, Ms. Wintour sat and listened.
In 2008 she helped collect an estimated $200,000 to Mr. Obama's election efforts. She also co-hosted two fund-raisers, one with Calvin Klein, another with Ms. Parker.
The president visited her home on Sullivan Street in 2010 for a mixer, where guests like Donna Karan and Calvin Klein paid up to $30,400 each to mingle. She teamed up with the Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein late last summer for another Obama event at Mr. Weinstein's home. The fee was $35,800.
''I can tell you she is incredibly concerned about where this country is going,'' Mr. Weinstein said. Friends have described her as a staunch Democrat, a bit of a leftie, as one put it. The devil reads Pravda?
She donated to Senator John Kerry's presidential campaign in 2004 and Hillary Rodham Clinton's senatorial efforts. But her political involvement has also aided more provincial concerns. She has put money and time into helping state legislators in New York who voted to legalize same-sex marriage. And in the 1990s she was instrumental in mobilizing the fashion industry's campaign to fight AIDS.
Politics has always surrounded Ms. Wintour, whether by choice or by birth. Her father, Charles Wintour, was the editor of the London Evening Standard. Her brother Patrick is the politics editor of The Guardian. The editor she is closest to at Conde Nast, the conglomerate that runs Vogue, Vanity Fair and other widely read magazines, is David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker.
This year she approached Ms. Parker about joining forces. Her pitch, according to one person who knows them both, was business-minded and strategic: to justify the $40,000-a-person price tag, they would need the star power that the two of them could deliver as a team.
Her political activity has led to speculation that she might be angling for a plum patronage position. An ambassadorship, perhaps. London? Paris? Her friends say the chatter is completely unfounded, just as it was four years ago.
''She has absolutely no interest in an ambassadorship,'' a close friend said this week, insisting on anonymity to protect that friendship. ''None. I can say that definitively.''
Millard Drexler, the chief executive of J. Crew, was among those attending Thursday night's fund-raiser. ''I don't think this is about her interest in politics,'' Mr. Drexler said. ''I think this is about her interested in taking on something she believes in. And when she takes something on, she does it with a great amount of ferocity.''
Inside the White House, the glamour factor has been the source of much strain and complication, weighing on decisions as seemingly inconsequential as choosing an interior designer to redecorate the private residence and picking the right pair of sneakers for Mrs. Obama to wear to a food bank. The Obamas tried to be exceedingly cautious out of a fear that they would be punished, particular in the conservative media, for being too chic, too out of touch.
''It is always a worry: how is this going to play in Peoria?'' said Anita McBride, who was chief of staff to Laura Bush and an adviser to three Republican White Houses.
Ultimately, Ms. McBride said, it is a balance the president and his team either learn to handle or not: ''Look at Nancy Reagan. She got vilified for having Betsy Bloomingdale as a friend and for wearing Adolfo. But she got the last laugh by showing up in rags at the Gridiron Dinner and singing 'Second Hand Rose.' ''
In the era of Tea Party austerity, the need to avoid the next fiasco over a $400 haircut (see Edwards, John) or exorbitant Tiffany's credit line (Gingrich, Newt and Callista) has only grown. Indeed, the White House predicted the inevitable backlash after Ms. Wintour appeared in a video shot by Obama campaign videographers at her town house. But they mishandled the rollout by releasing the video on the same day a Labor Department report showed the unemployment rate had risen.
Republican cackling ensued. Rush Limbaugh mocked him as ''Barack Hussein Kardashian.''
The Obama campaign is clearly skittish about having too much attention on this aspect of their fund-raising apparatus. When The New York Times attempted to interview Ms. Wintour and Ms. Parker for this article, their publicists sent their regrets. The campaign is nervous, they said.
But Mr. Obama's team proceeds with these high star-power events anyway, betting that the benefits of the five-figure checks they produce far outweigh any blow-back they might hear on Fox News or read in Red State. Of all the issues that are likely to shape the outcome of a presidential election, celebrity-studded fund-raisers are not among them, the president's advisers believe. And for good measure, they are always quick to note Mitt Romney's recent fund-raising gambit: ''Dine With the Donald,'' a contest in which people who donate $3 to Mr. Romney's campaign can win a dinner with Donald Trump.
The relationship has long been a two-way street between the Obama White House and celebrity patrons. Ms. Parker and Ms. Wintour were named to the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities. Ms. Wintour has attended two White House state dinners.
The pages of Vogue have certainly been kind to the Obamas. Mrs. Obama appeared on the cover shortly after the inauguration. Annie Leibovitz shot the photos. (Ms. Leibovitz also photographed Mr. Obama for the cover of Men's Vogue in 2008.) Andre Leon Talley, Vogue's editor at large, wrote about the first lady in hagiographic terms. ''She focuses all her calm attention on your face,'' he beamed. ''Being the focus of this reassuring gaze is akin to hearing a chord from John Coltrane's 'A Love Supreme.' Or maybe Ralph Vaughan Williams's 'The Lark Ascending.' All is well and right and real.''
Ms. Wintour may be well on her way to proving her savvy as a political player. But how quickly the political world will see her as something else is another question altogether.
Last Tuesday she was in Chicago at an Obama fund-raiser, where she introduced a line of pet clothes created by top designers. There was a Marc Jacobs dog sweater embroidered with ''Bark for Obama'' and a Thakoon leash and collar -- all for sale, with the proceeds going to the Obama campaign.
Ms. Wintour delivered remarks to the guests, some of whom paid $1,000 to have a picture taken with her. She said that when she was first approached by Matthew Barzun, the finance chairman of the campaign, she assumed he wanted to talk politics, or fund-raising, or perhaps hear her views on Europe.
''I did all my homework and went to the lunch with a big file, and he sat down at the meeting and said, 'Anna, I want to talk to you about pets,' '' she said.

HEADLINE: 2012's Financial Free-for-All

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
FRIENDSHIP brings such blessings. And such bargains! Only because of our closeness was President Obama willing to drop his asking price and offer me a picture and a moment with him on the cheap. At least that's what my invitation to a fund-raiser last Thursday night said.
I don't mean the Thursday night fund-raiser: that vaunted din-din at Sarah Jessica Parker's crib in Greenwich Village, where 50 glitterati paid 40 grand each. (I'll multiply: that's a $2 million haul.) I mean a second, follow-up fund-raiser, headlined by Mariah Carey at the Plaza, to which the president and first lady quickly zipped, double-dipping in Manhattan's lucrative waters to maximize their catch. 
The Plaza event was for a ''small group of friends,'' said the invitation, which came to me by mistake. (Like most journalists, I don't give political donations.) The invitation also said that in light of those friendships, the ''contribution amount has been kept low.'' How low? I had to open up an attachment to find out: a mere $10,000 for one person, $15,000 for a couple. Pocket change! Since 250 ''friends'' reportedly ended up in this ''small group,'' that's another $2 million haul, give or take.
Four years ago, Obama opted out of public financing for the general election, which would have given him $84 million for the September-to-November phase of the race but prevented additional fund-raising. He raised many times that -- his total, stretching back to the start of his primary campaign, was about $750 million -- and hugely outspent John McCain, who took public financing.
Two years later the Supreme Court, in the disastrous Citizens United ruling, cleared the way for unlimited donations to -- and expenditures by -- ''super PACs'' that could promote a given candidate so long as they didn't coordinate with him or her. Republican bigwigs got to furious work, determined to put Obama at the financial disadvantage this time around.
And here we are, in an age of austerity surreally contradicted by the hundreds of millions being poured into campaigns. By some estimates Election 2012 will be a $2 billion affair, the majority of that probably amassed and put into play on the Republican side.
There are indeed two Americas and two economies: one in which a conservative titan like Sheldon Adelson and his relatives blithely funnel $21 million toward the lost cause of Newt Gingrich, and another in which the median net worth of an American family has dropped to $77,300, which is roughly where it was in the early 1990s.
Campaign spending skyrockets while government spending is under siege. Political ad makers get rich while infrastructure crumbles. And presidential candidates have been turned into platinum-level panhandlers. When they could and should be mulling the metastasizing challenges of a country on the ropes, they're begging: to crowds of more than 1,000 and klatches of just a few dozen; over breakfasts and lunches and dinners; in multiple states on single days. Obama traveled to Maryland and Pennsylvania on Tuesday and pulled off six fund-raisers in as many hours.
Today's office seekers present vague promises but a detailed pricing chart. For X amount you get a speech; for more, a photo; for even more, all of that plus banter over canapes. Politicians are like airlines. You can fly them economy, business or first class.
Or you can try to buy one of your own. Isn't that essentially what the Koch brothers and Adelson are doing? As Nicholas Confessore reported in The Times last week, Charles and David Koch lead a group of conservative donors who have pledged to raise some $400 million during this campaign cycle for issue groups, including their super PAC, while Adelson and his family have thus far given at least $35 million to super PACs that support Republicans. Of that, $10 million recently went to Restore Our Future, which backs Romney. Adelson has said that he might spend $100 million when all is said and done.
''That is a great deal of money,'' noted McCain, a longtime proponent of tighter regulations on money in politics, in an interview Thursday on ''PBS NewsHour.'' ''And, again, we need a level playing field.''
WHAT we have, instead, is a gaudy free-for-all, so loopy and unctuous as to defy belief.
We have Scott Walker, the Wisconsin governor, yukking it up on the phone with a blogger who successfully passed himself off as David Koch and said, ''I'll fly you out to Cali and really show you a good time.''
''Outstanding,'' Walker responded.
We have Romney ignoring Donald Trump's attention-mongering tantrums about Obama's birthplace in return for fund-raising help, including a 63rd birthday lunch for Ann Romney on the 66th floor of Trump Tower in Manhattan. That was in April. The cynosure of the equestrienne-themed cake was an edible Ann on an edible horse. The tally was reportedly $600,000.
We have both the Romney and Obama campaigns soliciting donations by promising to enter donors in lotteries for dinner with the candidate and one (or more) of his celebrity boosters, and we have e-mail subject lines from the Obama campaign like these: ''Clooney,'' ''George Clooney. Really'' and ''Throw Bo a bone.''
Bo as in the First Dog. The money hunt enlists all creatures great and small.
We have early, primary-season assessments of candidates that hinge largely on what sort of fund-raising chops they seem to have. It's a bizarre qualification for governing, but a transcendent one, and that's been true for a few nutty decades now. George W. Bush in 2000, Howard Dean in 2004, Rick Perry this time around: all generated excitement because all generated money. Before the Iowa caucuses or the New Hampshire primary comes the first fund-raising report. It's nearly as relevant a verdict.
We have difficulty taking anything at face value. Did Cory Booker, the Newark mayor, denounce the Obama campaign's attacks on Bain Capital because he was really all that nettled by the negativity, or was he pacifying Wall Street, whose largess, which he enjoys, can be essential to a New Jersey politician? It's impossible not to wonder.
We have a financial arms race, which leads to a barrage of negative attack ads, which turn an already incendiary partisanship positively sulfurous.
Last week, as the fund-raising frenzy came into more ghastly relief, there were calls for a constitutional amendment to dismantle super PACs and for the Supreme Court to revisit Citizens United.
There was also a speech by Mitch McConnell, the leader of the Republican minority in the Senate, who likened the Obama campaign's complaints about conservative megadonors to President Nixon's so-called enemies list. McConnell praised Citizens United as a victory for free speech.
Hearing the word ''free'' in this context was the most surreal wrinkle of all, because right now we're shackled to a system that demeans the people running for office, corrodes voters' trust in them and doesn't do any honor to this democracy of ours.

HEADLINE: Declaration of Independence

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK

 BODY:
LAST January, Amy Chua got an unexpected e-mail just before an excerpt from her provocative child-rearing manual, ''Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,'' appeared in The Wall Street Journal. It was from Wendi Murdoch, the wife of Rupert Murdoch, whose News Corporation owns The Journal.
''She wanted her daughters to come to New Haven and meet my daughters,'' Ms. Chua said in a phone interview. Like the Murdoch girls, Ms. Chua's daughters are fluent in Chinese and English, and have a Chinese mother who grew up with a mother of her own who was unimaginably strict by Western standards.
''She was asking for advice like, 'How do you get a child to practice piano for more than one hour a day?' '' Ms. Chua recalled of their first meeting. ''She parents almost identically to the way I do.'' 
In return for Ms. Chua's parenting tips, Mrs. Murdoch gave the author some advice. After the excerpt ran in The Journal, Ms. Chua found herself the subject of an angry backlash on mommy blogs, morning TV and newspaper columns. A lot of friends tried to console Ms. Chua, but Mrs. Murdoch was different.
''She was like: 'Why do you care what people think? You have two wonderful daughters. Get over it,' '' Ms. Chua recalled.
If anyone is qualified to give advice on developing a thick skin, it's Wendi Deng Murdoch, 43, who harbors an ambition and busyness that would most likely exhaust even the most determined of Manhattan socialities.
Since the couple wed in 1999, Mrs. Murdoch, the third wife of Rupert Murdoch and 38 years his junior, has been viewed with suspicion and skepticism. At best, she was described as a ''trophy wife'' and at worse a ''gold digger.''
Lately, the intricate narrative of how Deng Wen Di from Jiangsu province in eastern China became Wendi Murdoch of the Rockefeller triplex on Fifth Avenue (and other homes in Beverly Hills and Carmel, Calif.; London; Cavan, South Australia; and Beijing) has taken another turn.
Even as her husband's company, News Corporation, faces scrutiny over a phone-hacking scandal at its British newspapers, Mrs. Murdoch has emerged with her own independent career and has immersed herself in a social circle that includes David Geffen, Larry Ellison, Tony Blair, Nicole Kidman and Bono, one that is often free of her husband's presence.
Her first film, ''Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,'' based on the best-selling book and produced with Florence Sloan, the Chinese wife of another media mogul, the former MGM studio chief Harry E. Sloan, came out in 2011. The pair are close to signing a deal with Sony Pictures to distribute their second movie based on the memoir ''Journey of a Thousand Miles,'' by the Chinese pianist Lang Lang.
Through a family spokesman, Mrs. Murdoch declined to be interviewed for this article, as did other members of the Murdoch family. But many of her friends were willing to discuss Mrs. Murdoch's new and, they say, more accurate public persona.
They describe someone who is, above almost all things, a world-class networker, collecting powerful friends and brokering connections. She hosts annual dinner parties with powerful women, hosts book parties for friends, and regularly holds get-togethers. When Tony and Cherie Blair visited Beijing in 2009, Mrs. Murdoch organized a dinner party with Chinese power brokers. (Mrs. Blair is now among those suing News Corporation's British newspaper unit in the phone hacking scandal.)
In May 2011, when Hugh Jackman, a close friend who made a cameo in ''Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,'' was in early performances of his one-man show in San Francisco, the project was largely a low-profile one. Until Mrs. Murdoch got involved.
''As a surprise Wendi flew in with about a dozen of the most influential people in the business,'' Mr. Jackman wrote in an e-mail. ''She is the best publicist anyone could ever have.'' The show later moved to Broadway.
If there was a single moment that crystallized Mrs. Murdoch's ascendancy in the public imagination, it was during her husband's testimony last July before a British parliamentary subcommittee over the widespread phone hacking that happened at one of his newspapers, The News of the World. Wearing a pink blazer, she sat behind him, then instinctively vaulted out of her chair to protect her husband from a protester's pie attack.
''Until the cream-pie incident, she'd really been branded the classic younger wife with a tinge of racism and stereotyping,'' said Andrew Butcher, a former senior communications executive at News Corporation. ''That turned everything around for her.''
''It seemed to finally give the marriage legitimacy,'' he added.
Friends said they were not surprised at all to see Mrs. Murdoch, a former competitive volleyball player, jump to her husband's defense. ''Nothing characterizes her more than that moment,'' said Diane von Furstenberg, a longtime friend whose husband, Barry Diller, worked for Mr. Murdoch. ''She is protective and fierce and not afraid of anything.''
Sally Shan, a managing director of HarbourVest Partners, a global private equity firm, and Mrs. Murdoch's roommate when they attended the Yale School of Management, said, ''I saw that and thought, That's my Wendi.''
IF Wendi Deng Murdoch had not married the world's most powerful media mogul, her life would probably read like an idealized version of the American immigrant story.
The third daughter of a Guangzhou factory director moves to the United States, and gets a job at the Sichuan Garden in Westwood, Calif., for $20 a day and all the leftover soup she can eat. She takes night classes at a commuter college, gets accepted by an Ivy League school, enters the media business and eventually finds herself walking red carpets and holding dinner parties at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. But this is no typical immigrant tale.
After Liz Smith announced in The New York Post in 1998 that Mr. Murdoch and his wife of 31 years, Anna, had amicably separated, the company crafted a widely accepted narrative that Mr. Murdoch and Wendi Deng met later, after he and Anna were already separated, when Ms. Deng accompanied Mr. Murdoch on a trip to Beijing.
In reality, they met months earlier during a town-hall-style session at Star TV, according to a person who was close to Mr. Murdoch at the time. Employees, gathered in the company's glistening new Kowloon headquarters in Hong Kong, lobbed mostly softball questions at Mr. Murdoch. Then Ms. Deng stood up.
''Why is your China strategy so bad?'' she asked Mr. Murdoch in her fractured English, according to a person close to News Corporation who attended the meeting. Unsatisfied with his answer, she approached him after the meeting, and they discussed media and China and business, all things that, coming from a younger, attractive woman, apparently proved an aphrodisiac to Mr. Murdoch.
He had been taken aback at how direct Ms. Deng was (friends say she still has almost no brain-to-mouth filter) and how much she enjoyed talking business, according to people close to the couple.
In 1999, 82 guests, watched as the couple wed on board Mr. Murdoch's 155-foot yacht, the Morning Glory, in New York Harbor.
In the early days of marriage, much was made of Mr. Murdoch's transformation: his shoddy hair-dye job, Prada suits, workout regimen and new SoHo loft. But less noted was the transformation happening to his wife. Mrs. Murdoch's friends like to talk about how the money has not fundamentally changed the brash, unfiltered, funny woman Mr. Murdoch first met in Kowloon. But in other ways, Mr. Murdoch's billions have significantly transformed her.
She used to wash her clothes and face with the same soap, said a 2008 Vogue article, and seldom wore makeup, much less luxuriated in the perks of privilege -- like the private yoga classes with her friends Kathy Freston and Arianna Huffington -- she indulges in today. At Yale, she would stake out Filene's Basement to procure designer gowns on the cheap. Today, she is regularly photographed wearing Rodarte and Prada.
Mrs. Murdoch quickly and giddily embraced the trappings of great wealth. While her husband conducted business in various European capitals, she would travel with him and shop for glassware and cutlery and curtains to stock her new homes. In addition to their loft in SoHo, the Murdochs transformed an old hutong in Beijing into a courtyard oasis decorated with art by Chinese artists.
At the same time, she tried to find a place for herself in the family business, brokering meetings in China and weighing in on MySpace's Chinese operations. As head of Star TV, James Murdoch worked with his stepmother to try to repair News Corporation's standing in China. In turn, Mrs. Murdoch earned James's respect, and he became the first of Mr. Murdoch's four grown children to accept his father's third marriage, according to a person close to the Murdoch family.
Still, there were bumps. The first came in 2000, when The Wall Street Journal, not yet owned by News Corporation, published a 4,000-word front-page article about her. It described how, in 1988 at age 19, she had moved to Los Angeles with a married couple, Jake and Joyce Cherry, to learn English. Mr. Cherry and Wendi Deng had an affair, according to the article, and she married him in 1990. The marriage lasted two years seven months, according to Los Angeles court records. In that time, she got a green card and enrolled at California State University, Northridge.
Mr. Murdoch was furious, according to people close to News Corporation who would not discuss the article on the record, even though it was the kind of article he would have loved -- had it been in one of his newspapers and about someone else's third wife.
The article and subsequent follow-ups by other publications branded Mrs. Murdoch as a calculating seductress for much of the next decade.
Then in 2006, there was an infamous marital battle when Mr. Murdoch declared in a TV interview with Charlie Rose that while Grace and Chloe, his daughters with Wendi, would have an equal economic interest in the family's trust, they would not have the same voting rights as his children from his previous marriages, Prudence, Elisabeth, Lachlan and James.
Wendi Murdoch was enraged. It was the first she had heard of that decision.
''He became this typical husband whose wife threatened to leave him,'' said a person close to News Corporation who would not speak for attribution about the Murdochs' relationship. ''It was surreal.''
They worked through it, and by all accounts, Wendi has had a hugely positive impact on Rupert. She will openly roll her eyes at him when he's out of line and tell him when he's wrong, even while the two are in public.
''She has a great upbeat personality and is one of the few people who can keep Rupert Murdoch under control,'' said Mr. Butcher, the former News Corporation spokesman. ''In the very early days of the marriage she was somewhat subordinate, but that pretty quickly changed.''
As their daughters, Grace, 10, and Chloe, 8 (whom Mrs. Murdoch refers to as ''Grace Chloe'' in her still-heavily accented English) get older, she has taken on a wide range of professional endeavors, including the film business. Mrs. Murdoch was actively involved in the production of ''Snow Flower and the Secret Fan,'' and according to all accounts she thoroughly enjoyed her autonomy and power. At one point she stood up in a boardroom full of China's most powerful film executives and demanded that the posters for ''Snow Flower'' be better positioned around Shanghai and that more money be spent on marketing.
''They all just got quiet and took it in,'' said Wayne Wang, the film's director. ''The next day I started to see posters on the streets and buses that were the way she wanted them.''
Even as she forges her own identity, Mr. Murdoch's influence is never far. ''Snow Flower'' was released domestically by News Corporation's Fox Searchlight in July 2011 just as revelations surfaced that The News of the World had hacked into the voice mail of Milly Dowler, the teenager who had been kidnapped and murdered. The film grossed only about $11 million worldwide.
In recent months, as James Murdoch continues to face scrutiny about his involvement in the scandal in Britain, and has resigned several key positions in the Murdoch empire, investors have questioned the future leadership of News Corporation. In only the most hushed and off-the-record conversations do people close to the company ask: could Wendi take over one day?
Doubtful. In contrast to Anna Murdoch, who had an office on News Corporation's corporate floor and a position on the board until 1998, when Mr. Murdoch forced her off, the third Mrs. Murdoch is kept at a distance.
''I'd say she actively does not want a role in the company,'' said Mr. Geffen, a longtime friend. ''Nor does she have an ambition to have her kids involved in the company.''
Mrs. Murdoch was an early investor in Art.sy, an online start-up designed to help art enthusiasts browse works from galleries, museums and private collections. Early on, the Web site was having difficulty convincing gallery owners and artists to agree to allow it to display their art online.
Mrs. Murdoch brought on her friend Dasha Zhukova, the Russian socialite and wife of the billionaire Roman Abramovich. The two women hosted parties in Miami's Art Basel to help introduce the Art.sy founder, Carter Cleveland, to Larry Gagosian and Marc Glimcher, among other key players gathered for the annual art fair.
''Here I was a 24-year-old nerdy computer science major, and I was going from booth to booth with Dasha and Wendi,'' Mr. Cleveland said.
Mrs. Murdoch initially found out about Art.sy the way wealthy and well-connected people hear about potential investments: through a friend. The friend was Joshua Kushner, who runs the private equity firm Thrive Capital and whose sister-in-law, Ivanka Trump, is a close friend of Mrs. Murdoch's.
The Murdochs briefly occupied a nearby condo in the Trump Park Avenue building, where Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump live. Grace and Chloe speak Mandarin to Ms. Trump's young daughter, Arabella, and the Murdoch women regularly attend Ms. Trump's Sabbath dinners. (''She loves the challah,'' Ms. Trump said of Mrs. Murdoch. ''She calls it 'that bread.' '')
IN recent months, the Murdochs have grown to live largely separate lives, with Mrs. Murdoch taking the girls to piano lessons and attending red-carpet galas, and Mr. Murdoch dealing with the scandal unfolding in Britain. As Mrs. Murdoch attended the Oscars in February, Mr. Murdoch traveled to London to visit the newsroom of the embattled Sun tabloid, which has been accused of widespread bribery to a network of corrupt officials.
He rarely accompanies her to the many charitable events and parties she attends, partly because he is 81 and partly to avoid the news media, said several people close to the couple who did not want to discuss their marital relations for attribution. (This weekend, the couple are vacationing in Venice, after attending News Corporation meetings in Rome and Milan.)
It has not been entirely easy for Mrs. Murdoch to feel comfortable around the kind of company she now keeps. ''I've seen her evolve over time in terms of her capacity to handle meeting people in the industry and senior government officials,'' said Ms. Shan, her graduate school roommate. ''Initially that wasn't her comfort zone.''
Mrs. Murdoch still regularly (and humorously) drops references to how far she has come since her meager childhood in China.
Like last year when she and Ms. Huffington hosted a party at Ms. Huffington's Manhattan apartment to celebrate Mrs. Freston's newest weight-loss book, ''The Lean.'' Guests included Martha Stewart, Joel Klein and Harvey Weinstein. Because Mrs. Freston is a vegan, the caterers had assembled a meatless spread with tofu, quinoa and kale spun into elaborate hors d'oeuvres.
Ms. Huffington recalled a toast Mrs. Murdoch gave. ''She said, 'I grew up so poor in China that one day I aspired to have meat regularly,' '' Mrs. Huffington said. '' 'Now that I can have meat three times a day, Kathy tells us we can't have any meat at all.' ''

HEADLINE: Energy Etch A Sketch

 BODY:
As governor of Massachusetts, Mitt Romney endorsed an aggressive program to reduce the state's greenhouse gas emissions, pushed to close old coal-fired power plants and embraced wind and solar power. Then came his bids for the Republican presidential nomination, first in 2008 and now in 2012. On climate change as on other issues, he has transformed himself, bit by reactionary bit.
Today he is a proclaimed skeptic on global warming, a champion of oil and other fossil fuels, a critic of federal efforts to develop cleaner energy sources and a sworn enemy of the Environmental Protection Agency. 
Mr. Romney has plainly decided that satisfying his party's antiregulatory base is essential to his political future. But the policies he espouses would be devastating for the country and the planet. If there are doubts on that point, the most recent findings from the International Energy Agency should dispel them: the agency reports an alarming one-year increase in global greenhouse gas emissions, largely because of increasing coal use around the world.
The agency also said that keeping global temperatures below a dangerous threshold is ''still within reach'' if nations aggressively reduce fossil-fuel consumption while nurturing low-carbon alternatives. And where is Mr. Romney on that? Nowhere.
The man who once worried about climate-driven sea-level rise in poor countries like Bangladesh now says things like ''My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet,'' as if mainstream science were wrong and humans had nothing to do with it.
On coal, the governor who once stood in front of a Massachusetts coal-fired power plant and said, ''that plant kills people,'' recently whirled through Craig, Colo., talking up coal and accusing President Obama of making it ''harder to get coal out of the ground.''
On oil and gas, Mr. Romney is wholly in the drill now, drill everywhere mode championed by House Republicans. If his spokesmen are to be believed, he would open up vulnerable and legally protected public lands to drilling. Despite his proclaimed belief in a competitive free-enterprise system -- and his concerns about the deficit -- Mr. Romney is determined to maintain the oil's industry's preposterous $4 billion-a-year tax breaks.
When Mr. Romney talks about energy, he means what he calls ''real energy'' -- he-man energy like coal, oil and natural gas, not what he contemptuously dismisses as Mr. Obama's ''imaginary world where government-subsidized windmills and solar panels could power the economy.'' Or as he once said, ''You can't drive a car with a windmill on it.''
Meanwhile, the self-described risk-taker who once touted clean energy as ''an economic engine very much like biotech'' now regularly denounces Mr. Obama for taking risks. His campaign organized a press trip on May 31 to the shuttered factory of a solar panel maker, Solyndra, which went bankrupt and took $535 million in federal loan guarantees with it. Mr. Romney attacked Mr. Obama for ''crony capitalism'' and, by implication, indicted the entire federal effort to jump-start nascent technologies.
Never mind that Solyndra is the only big failure so far in a broad $37.6 billion program that began under George W. Bush. Or that there is not a single important energy source in this country -- especially oil -- that has not received support from government subsidies. Never mind that there is no way this country is going to wean itself from foreign oil or address climate change without alternative fuels.
Mr. Romney has been especially eager to demonize the E.P.A. and environmental regulations Last fall he declared that ''the E.P.A. has gotten completely out of control for a very simple reason. It is a tool in the hands of the president to crush the private enterprise system, to crush our ability to have energy whether it's oil, gas, coal or nuclear.''
What Mr. Romney has either forgotten or chosen to ignore is that the clean water and clean air laws the E.P.A. is enforcing were passed by bipartisan majorities four decades ago when Republicans were still interested in protecting Americans' health and the environment.
The idea that a politician, especially Mr. Romney, would change his positions for political gain won't surprise anyone. But the costs of not getting energy policy right -- America's security, its global competitiveness, public health and the health of the planet -- are much too high for such cynical business as usual.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Schools for Rich and Poor

 BODY:
Readers discuss how to reduce educational inequities.
The Letter
To the Editor:
Poor children living in poor communities do not have access to the same educational opportunities as their wealthier peers, and no amount of testing or so-called accountability will change this truth. Yet the solution that Mitt Romney promotes, allowing poor students to attend any public or private school of their choice, will likely do little to rectify the problem. Indeed, as we have learned in New York City, school choice tends to reify economic and racial isolation and worsen educational inequities.
If we really want to achieve educational equity, we should focus our efforts on sending poor, middle-class and wealthy children to the same schools. A recent Times article documenting the impressive fund-raising results of public school PTAs in some of New York's toniest neighborhoods makes this point clearly: Parents with means are better positioned -- financially, politically and socially -- to ensure that the schools their children attend have the necessary resources, from arts enrichment to a pleasant physical environment.
The silver lining in Mr. Romney's education plan is his willingness to breach district lines and allow poor urban children to attend school in surrounding suburbs. Admittedly, this is a tricky proposition. 
In most of the country, school district boundaries are closely linked to property values. Those who can afford to live in a more expensive neighborhood know that the exclusivity of their local schools helps maintain their investment. While wealthier parents may be open in theory to increased racial and class diversity in their children's schools, it is unlikely that they or their neighbors will accept the drop in property values that would occur if where one lived were disentangled from where one attends school.
Yet it is very difficult to imagine ever achieving any kind of educational equity in this country without infringing on district boundaries.

The writer is an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs at Baruch College, CUNY.
Readers React
It would be an oversimplification to think just having poor and rich children going to school together would be a panacea for the problems facing socioeconomically disadvantaged children. Wealthier children do better not just because of schools and PTA resources, but because of the atmosphere they are surrounded by from the moment of birth.
Whether it is early reading opportunities, high-quality child care and private preschools, greater access to creative extracurricular activities, or hovering well-educated parents, it is hard to imagine poorer families being able to match all of these advantages and more by simply changing classroom geography.
Efforts should focus more on using public funds to educate poor communities about the factors critical for academic success, such as parental involvement, regular reading habits, good nutrition and large-scale mentoring programs. The most important change, though, is cultural: placing a high value on a good education for all children will lead to committed long-term investment at both the family and community level.
NEHA SAMPATH San Diego, June 14, 2012
Any approach to improving educational opportunity for all fails if it focuses on school choice, whether by vouchers or otherwise. It also fails if it focuses on sending children from one district to another, whether across the street or across town, to balance school populations across income levels. The answer must be in a robust, centralized federal program that improves all schools to minimum levels of achievement, whether by No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top or the next big idea.
Without a broad, uncompromising approach to improve public schools everywhere for all students, those who need the most help will end up, as usual, with the least opportunity. And the country as a whole suffers with the myriad burdens of a perpetual underclass stuck in a cycle of underachievement.
The conservative plan championed by Mitt Romney and others has no ''silver lining.'' Finding more ways to expand choice (whether by vouchers or other means) will leave the most disadvantaged children far, far behind, in schools that are underserved and underfunded. Engaged parents who understand the value of education and who are interested in their children's success will make wise choices for the best schools available. It's the children whose parents are disengaged who will be stuck at the failing neighborhood school.
Those who rail against big government need to put education in a sacred and separate discussion. The public school system needs to be fortified by a robust central authority, coupled with state, local and parental involvement. Handing out vouchers or otherwise enabling engaged parents to remove the students most likely to succeed from less desirable schools doesn't solve the problem for the good of the community. It punishes the most needy children and perpetuates their cycle of poverty and underachievement.
DAPHNE CASE Norwalk, Conn., June 14, 2012
The Schott Foundation for Public Education strongly endorses much of Ms. Kafka's proposal. The foundation's recent report, ''A Rotting Apple: Education Redlining in New York City,'' documents that within New York City, resources available to students depend on the level of their parents' income. The situation in suburbs and smaller cities and towns is equally, if not more, inequitable.
We differ, however, in the implied simple solution of transporting children from one school to another. A more efficient solution -- one typical of nearly every other developed country -- is to sever the connection between school finance and local property tax.
Putting in place common, statewide school finance measures so that the resources available to schools would be allocated according to the educational needs of the students -- rather than the comparative wealth of their parents -- would improve educational opportunities for all students. Equal opportunity, after all, should be the American way.
JOHN H. JACKSON President and C.E.O. Schott Foundation for Public Education Cambridge, Mass., June 13, 2012
In theory, Ms. Kafka's proposal makes a lot of sense. In many states, especially Balkanized ones like New York and New Jersey, school district borders undermine or totally obstruct worthy education reforms.
The question Ms. Kafka poses is whether we're really prepared to do something serious about equalizing educational opportunities and reducing the alarming achievement gaps among children based on race, ethnicity and socioeconomic status. New Jersey and New York have been prominent leaders in using litigation to equalize funding for urban school districts. But now, with fiscal crises everywhere, equalized funding for urban schools is under constant attack and its survival is uncertain.
What to do then? Can we overcome district and municipal boundaries and the compulsive commitment to localism that undergirds them? Perhaps the fiscal crunch afflicting states and localities will increase that possibility. Perhaps consolidating school districts and municipalities will cease being a political third rail if the case can be made for significant cost savings and other efficiencies.
Perhaps the Balkanized Northern states might even consider, dare I say, the Southern model of county, rather than municipal, school districts. In New Jersey, such a shift would reduce the number of districts from more than 600 to 21. Countywide school districts could open up all kinds of possibilities for educational reform that might start us on the road to truly equalizing opportunities for all students.
PAUL TRACTENBERG Newark, June 13, 2012
The writer, a professor of law at Rutgers School of Law-Newark, is founder of the Education Law Center and co-director of the Rutgers-Newark Institute on Education Law and Policy.
Since time immemorial we've been talking about poor children living in poor communities not having access to quality education. Yet here comes Mitt Romney with his voucher idea (without calling it that). Nothing new here. So far the results of voucher programs have been underwhelming. No matter how children are shifted around, as they were during our busing phase, the results continue to be inauspicious.
A real way to assure that all children will learn to their fullest capacities is to have them socialize, rub elbows, mix and mingle, in other words, truly integrate. And I don't mean the schools; I mean neighborhoods.
Children learn all manner of things from one another in their neighborhoods. Why do we continue to put all our children's eggs in one basket -- the school? Maybe how we go about integrating the suburbs in this 21st century should be considered.
The key to our education problem is integration of communities, not just schools, if we want to do the best for the children.
GEORGIA WOOD Brooklyn, June 13, 2012
To call allowing students to attend the school of their choice irrespective of district lines a ''tricky proposition,'' as Ms. Kafka does, is a remarkable understatement. How many city students does a suburb have to take? How are we going to get them there and who pays to do it?
Surely a forced sharing of public facilities is not the best means to educational equity, even within the city, but certainly across district lines. The physical impracticality overwhelms long before we get to the impact on property values.
Adequate centralized funding of public schools, making a city school sufficiently adequate to preclude the need for choice, is much more sensible. I can appreciate the desire to jump on any perceived silver lining in a Mitt Romney plan, but he must know that this one is going nowhere.
CHRISTOPHER J. HORSCH Chicago, June 13, 2012
I will begin my first year as a high school math teacher this fall. What drove me into education is the exact problem that Ms. Kafka and many others write about -- the expanding education gap between the richest and poorest.
When I was 14 my parents moved my brother and me from a rural town in northeastern Ohio to a university city just seven miles down the road. This small seven-mile move made all the difference in the education that my brother and I received.
For us to have the type of educational equality that Ms. Kafka and I (and surprisingly Mitt Romney) all want, we need to separate funding for education from property taxes so that students can move freely between districts.
BENJAMIN CHILDERS Tucson, June 13, 2012
Ms. Kafka's school plan is rational and appealing. But it relies on assumptions that may not be valid today, if they ever were. As she acknowledges, wealthier Americans would have to give up or share the educational edge that moving to suburban school districts has given their children. Remember the proliferation of private schools that occurred after the desegregation decision?
It also assumes that government could implement such a program. Given today's conservative paranoia of any government actions, such an initiative would almost surely bring millions of shouts of ''keep the government out of our classrooms!''
Ms. Kafka's plan is commendable, but tragically it might be a plan for an America that has ceased to exist.
THEODORE S. VOELKER New York, June 13, 2012
The Writer Responds
As a group these letters raise two kinds of concerns about my proposal. The first is technical and the second is political. Ms. Sampath is absolutely right that putting poor children in the same classrooms as wealthy children will not erase all the disadvantages of poverty. But it will allow poor students access to the advantages -- financial and otherwise -- that wealthy students experience at school, and it will provide the kind of integration Ms. Wood describes, if only during school hours.
I don't think the logistical challenges Mr. Horsch raises are insurmountable. In many parts of the country poor and wealthy communities live side by side; the physical task of integrating their schools would be quite minimal. In addition, a large portion of public (and private) school students already take a bus to school; we would just need to change some of their destinations.
Equalizing school funding through some kind of centralized mechanism, while an admirable goal, will not be sufficient. First, as the Schott Foundation's report so aptly demonstrates, even within single districts there are gross inequities between schools attended by the poor and the wealthy. Second, even if we could find a way to eliminate school funding disparities, separate can never be truly equal. The goal of educational adequacy that Ms. Case promotes quietly acknowledges this.
Indeed, the real challenge of my proposal is political. Mr. Voelker and Mr. Tractenberg ask if Americans will accept the kind of government intrusion in our local schools this plan requires. But of course the federal government is already in our classrooms, under the mistaken belief that it can mandate equity through testing.
The larger issue is if Americans are willing to commit to equalizing opportunity in this country. Perhaps not. But today we have both political parties signed on to this goal at least in principle, and they are quickly running out of other solutions.

HEADLINE: C.E.O. Pay, Rising Despite the Din

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
YOU call this a revolution?
Probably the most-heard complaint about big business these days, one seemingly tailored for the 99 percent, is how much money corporate C.E.O.'s routinely pull down. Many ordinary Americans probably cheered when stockholders -- that is, the people who actually own public companies -- finally began to say, ''Enough.''
Yeah, well.
Despite a lot of noise from shareholders and a few victories at big names like Citigroup and Hewlett-Packard, executive pay just keeps climbing. 
Yes, some corporate boards seem to be listening to shareholders, particularly on contentious issues like the seven-figure cash bonuses that helped define hyperwealth during the boom. Since the bust, corporate America on the whole has moved to tie executive pay more closely to long-term performance by skewing executive paychecks more toward restricted stock, which can't be sold for years.
But rewards at the top are still rich -- and getting richer. Now that 2011 proxy statements have been filed, the extent of executive pay last year has finally become clear. Median pay of the nation's 200 top-paid C.E.O.'s was $14.5 million, according to a study conducted for The New York Times by Equilar, a compensation data firm based in Redwood City, Calif. The median pay raise among those C.E.O.'s was 5 percent. (The full list is available here.)
That 5 percent raise is smaller than last year's. But it comes at a time of stubbornly high unemployment and declining wealth for many ordinary Americans. Even corporate pay experts say that this is hardly the kind of change that will quell anger over the nation's have-a-lots by the have-lesses, particularly in an election year.
''The bigger issues are there, still to be worked on, and those are the more difficult ones,'' says Eleanor Bloxham, the chief executive of the Value Alliance, a firm in Westerville, Ohio, that consults on corporate pay. Corporations are changing pay practices, Ms. Bloxham says, but not enough: ''There is too much hype and too little substance.''
The latest list of the most richly rewarded executives expands on a preliminary survey Equilar put together for The Times in April, before many companies had submitted final regulatory filings for 2011. While the earlier study showed the median pay package rising 2 percent from 2010 to 2011, the final figures put the increase at 5 percent.
The list has many familiar names, like Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle ($77.6 million) and Leslie Moonves of CBS ($68.4 million). But a number of executives from smaller companies also landed near the top. Discovery Communications had about a tenth the revenue of Oracle last year, but gave its C.E.O., David M. Zaslav, $52.4 million, the sixth-largest pay package in corporate America, according to Equilar.
Because the list includes only the C.E.O.'s of public companies, it does not capture the many billions that have been earned by top hedge fund managers and private-equity dealmakers in recent years. But even in the more narrow universe of public companies, the complete Equilar study shows that there was not one, but two executives who had nine-figure paydays last year -- the first time that has ever happened, according to Aaron Boyd, Equilar's head of research.
David E. Simon, the top executive at the Simon Property Group, was the second-highest paid C.E.O. last year, with $137 million. He joined the exclusive nine-figure niche occupied by Timothy D. Cook, who succeeded Steve Jobs at Apple. Mr. Cook received a package valued at $378 million. The pay of both Mr. Simon and Mr. Cook were bolstered by one-time rewards that the companies said would not be repeated, and that are tied to future company performance.
In Mr. Simon's case, this was a stock package that will be distributed over eight years that was worth $132 million when granted last year. Like Mr. Cook's bonus, it has already gained substantially in value.
While Apple shareholders overwhelmingly approved Mr. Cook's compensation, Simon Property investors lopsidedly rejected Mr. Simon's pay package at the annual meeting in May, with 73.3 percent voting against it, according to Institutional Shareholder Services. But such votes aren't binding. That means companies can do as they want, whatever shareholders say.
The fact that there were votes at both companies shows the new power that investors have seized. Despite opposition from corporate America, the Dodd-Frank legislation mandated that public companies give shareholders a vote on compensation strategy at least once every six years. Last year brought the first onslaught of such say-on-pay votes, and this year 1,714 companies have already held them, says the consulting firm Semler Brossy. Among those, 45 companies' pay strategies have been rejected by shareholders, up from 29 last year at this time.
The votes have had immediate impact, pushing many corporate boards to explain to investors how they reached pay decisions, and influencing some companies to rein in golden parachutes like the ones Hewlett-Packard gave its last two chiefs.
To address criticism that C.E.O. pay has become untethered from company performance, companies have been giving more bonuses in restricted stock that can be sold only if an executive manages to increase revenue or the stock price. An Equilar survey of all companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index shows that the median amount of stock awarded to C.E.O.'s rose 10.7 percent from 2010 to 2011, while cash awards fell 6.8 percent.
Ira T. Kay, a managing partner at the consulting firm Pay Governance, said companies had set ''hard goals'' for executives that explained why they ''are so motivated to run these companies very well.'' He gives these pay packages some credit for the performance of American corporations, which have recovered faster from the financial crisis than the overall economy. ''Maybe it has caused some issues between the 1 percent and the 99 percent,'' he said. ''But it has certainly made for a very strong corporate sector in the U.S.''
Still, the votes against the pay packages at companies like Simon Property also underline some of the hollowness of the shareholder initiatives. Investors get a vote on pay only after the numbers have been set by corporate boards. And, because the votes are nonbinding, they carry only the sting of possible embarrassment.
After its meeting, Simon released a statement saying executives ''value'' shareholders' input and that its compensation panel ''will take their views into consideration as it reviews compensation plans.''
MORE important, shareholder votes often take on companies where executive pay is out of line with industry norms. They don't address the fact that even companies using the norms have raised C.E.O. pay faster than the wages of average employees.
Charles M. Elson, director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware, said the sharp rise in executive pay was a result of the practice of setting C.E.O. compensation by looking at what other companies in the same industry are doing, then adding a bit. The additions are intended to ensure that executives stay put. The Simon Property Group said the bonus offered to Mr. Simon ''is intended to ensure that one of America's best C.E.O.'s will lead the company until at least 2019, when Mr. Simon will be 58 years of age, rather than pursuing other employment opportunities.''
But Mr. Elson said that the fears of chief executives jumping ship were misplaced, while the steady rise in executive pay had damaged corporate morale, causing employees to ask, ''Why should I kill myself to get a 2 percent raise if the C.E.O. is going to get a 20 percent raise?''
Equilar used a different method than it had in past years to compile its list of C.E.O. pay for The Times, focusing on the top-paid executives at all public companies, rather than just those at the 200 largest ones. This change revealed that many of the highest-paid executives were at smaller companies. Indeed, 89 of the 200 executives worked at companies that were too small to make the list for 2010 pay.
The smallest company, by revenue, on the new list is Akamai Technologies, with sales last year of $1.1 billion -- or 0.2 percent of sales at the largest, Exxon Mobil. While Exxon paid its C.E.O., Rex Tillerson, $25.2 million, Akamai paid its chief, Paul Sagan, $11.9 million. Nearly all of it was in stock awards and options, but it faced opposition by Institutional Shareholder Services, which advises investors.
Akamai fought back, writing a letter in which it argued that the big award was necessary to persuade Mr. Sagan to stay on after he had indicated a desire to retire. Some 52 percent of the company's shareholders ended up supporting the pay package.
Mr. Kay, at Pay Governance, said critics of current C.E.O. pay underestimate the willingness of executives to leave their positions.
''Could you pay them a little less?'' he asked. ''I think you could.'' But he added: ''You are dealing with board members that don't want to lose their C.E.O., and they buy insurance by paying at the industry standard.''

HEADLINE: Am I Going To Be Miserable If I Win?

BYLINE: By MATT BAI

 BODY:
When Bob Kerrey left the Senate after two terms in 2001 -- mainly, he says now, so he could remarry and start a new family away from politics -- he was considered a statesmanlike and contemplative presence in a city that still valued both qualities. Kerrey had been a serious presidential candidate, a respected voice on health care and intelligence and co-chairman of one of those bipartisan commissions to reform entitlement programs. His closest friends included the small crowd of Vietnam veterans from both parties -- John McCain, John Kerry, Chuck Hagel, Chuck Robb, Max Cleland -- for whom party loyalty seemed well down the list of daily concerns.
Of that group, only the two failed presidential nominees remain, and McCain, once a symbol of independence, seems like a changed man, seething with partisan bitterness. A half-dozen of the Senate's other remaining centrists -- including Ben Nelson, the Democrat who took the Nebraska seat Kerrey vacated in 2001 -- are leaving voluntarily at the beginning of next year, and another, Richard Lugar, was just kicked to the curb in a divisive primary after 36 years of service. On the issues Kerrey says he cares most about, namely entitlements and debt reduction, efforts to find some bipartisan accord have gone nowhere, and those senators who try hardest to bridge the divide seem increasingly beaten down. 
And yet here is Bob Kerrey, as he approaches his 69th birthday, returning to Nebraska after a decadelong hiatus in Greenwich Village as the president of The New School, determined to reclaim his seat and his voice in the debate. It's a decision that puzzles most of Washington. Last month, as we traveled around Nebraska in a wobbly six-seat plane, I suggested to Kerrey that he was like a guy trying to angle his way back into a disaster zone while his like-minded colleagues were desperately seeking safe passage out. He laughed but didn't dispute the point. ''That's a disturbing metaphor,'' Kerrey said.
Democratic leaders in Washington pleaded with Kerrey to run, because he is still the closest thing they have to a star attraction in Nebraska. Harry Reid, the majority leader, even promised to consider Kerrey's previous service when it comes time to dole out committee assignments. But ''just about everybody else who lives in Washington told me not to do it,'' Kerrey admitted. ''They just said the place has become too toxic and you can't get things done.''
Kerrey insists he isn't seeking the Senate seat out of restlessness. (He was offered the chance to become the movie industry's top lobbyist in 2010 and recently became chairman of GlobalScholar, a for-profit education-software venture.) Nor is he mired in some late-life crisis, trying to reclaim his glory years. It is simply, Kerrey says, a calling to try to lead the Senate toward some consensus. ''It's not that nobody's doing it,'' he told me. ''It's just I feel the need to do it.''
This sounds plausible enough coming from a Medal of Honor recipient who spent the better part of two decades in public office. Still it makes you wonder whether Bob Kerrey is deluding himself about what he can achieve if he somehow is elected. There are moments when Kerrey himself seems uncertain of the answer. When a Democrat in North Platte pressed him on whether Washington could make any progress in a bipartisan way, Kerrey's thoughts seemed momentarily to slip past his internal censor. ''One of the concerns I've got, literally, is: Am I going to be miserable if I win?'' he said. But later, when we were discussing his decision, Kerrey sounded more hopeful. ''When you're standing somewhere else, things look different. It's good to come back if you can.'' He paused. ''And if you can't, that's fine too.''
I met up with Kerrey in Omaha on the morning after he officially became the Democratic nominee, and we immediately set out on a nine-city tour across the state, mostly short stops where he could address local reporters in airport hangars or conference rooms before climbing back aboard the plane. He had lost the all-black get-up he sometimes wore in New York and had on a white shirt and conservative blue tie, blue blazer and gray slacks. Since his days in the Senate, Kerrey's hair has turned completely white, and he immediately brought to mind John Slattery's character from ''Mad Men,'' in his physical resemblance and in his impolitic brand of humor.
Walking into the tiny airport in Kearney, Kerrey was greeted by Sue Parsons, a former civics teacher. ''I want to ask you what we do about Social Security,'' she said as he extended his hand. ''I mean, it sounds like it's in the tank, and I'm 58.''
''Your Social Security's fine,'' Kerrey assured her.
''But what about my son?''
''Oh, he's screwed,'' Kerrey said. Then he asked where the cookies were.
The last time Kerrey was on the ballot, Tom Foley was the House speaker and ''Seinfeld'' was America's No. 1 show. That means he has never practiced politics in the age of Twitter, when every offhanded quip can and will be used against you, usually in the space of an hour. It also means that a large chunk of the state's voters, especially the younger ones who might be more inclined to vote for a Democrat, know very little about him. Most of Kerrey's energy at the moment is directed at reintroducing himself to Nebraska, along with his wife, the screenwriter Sarah Paley, and the couple's 10-year-old son, Henry, neither of whom have ever lived there. On a car ride through rural North Platte, Kerrey chatted with the Republican city administrator, happily sharing teenage memories of eating cow testicles and seeing ranch hands get their eyes gouged out by rampaging bulls.
But reconnecting, even with friends from his former life, can be harder than Kerrey anticipated. ''You don't want to meet?'' he asked an apparently reluctant supporter on a phone call. He sounded hurt. ''O.K., but look, 40 percent of what I'm doing here is to meet with old friends, because I'm staying here, win or lose. I'm spending a lot of time with old friends, for no other reason than to spend time with old friends.''
Kerrey's long absence from the state -- his supposed abandonment of so-called Nebraska values in favor of whatever elitist witchcraft you practice in a brownstone near Washington Square Park -- has predictably become a central talking point for his opponent, a little-known state senator named Deb Fischer. During her primary against two better-financed opponents, Fischer, a cattle rancher from rural Valentine, won late support from Sarah Palin and from the Nebraska-born billionaire Joe Ricketts, whose super PAC bought more than $250,000 worth of TV ads on her behalf. Even as I arrived in Nebraska on primary night, Americans for Prosperity, the group founded by the conservative businessmen David and Charles Koch, was running a TV ad in Nebraska accusing Kerrey of ''ditching our state'' and ''pushing an East Coast liberal agenda.'' (''I don't know whose prosperity the Koch brothers are interested in,'' Kerrey told one audience. ''My guess is it's their prosperity, and they already look pretty prosperous to me.'')
Although the election season hasn't quite begun in earnest, early public polls showed Fischer ahead by double digits, and most of the people who handicap Senate races for a living consider Kerrey a long shot. Only 32 percent of Nebraskans now call themselves Democrats, compared with 48 percent who self-identify as Republicans, and Barack Obama is as popular in the state as corn blight.
Even so, it's hard to imagine that Kerrey won't at least make a competitive race of it -- which is probably why Americans for Prosperity and Karl Rove's Crossroads GPS spent more than a combined $200,000 attacking him in the first two weeks after the primary, according to Kantar Media/CMAG, which tracks ad expenditures. The advantage in registration among Republicans in the state doesn't tell the full story; while the number of Republicans has stayed about constant and the number of Democrats has dropped sharply since Kerrey last ran, the percentage of independent voters has nearly doubled. Theoretically, at least, these are Kerrey's kind of voters. And while Mitt Romney should carry the state without displacing a single pomaded hair, Nebraskans have a pretty solid history of splitting their votes between parties. Kerrey, who served as governor in the mid-1980s, initially won his seat in 1988, the year that George H. W. Bush trounced Michael Dukakis. Nelson succeeded him in 2001, even as the second Bush carried the state by nearly 30 points.
Also, while Fischer may appeal to Tea Party types as a conservative insurgent, she is relatively untested and entirely new to national issues, which means Kerrey is not the only one who has something to fear from the twittering masses. I mentioned in passing to Kerrey, as we walked on a tarmac, that I wouldn't want to be a state senator debating him on the intricacies of Medicare and terrorism. ''Neither would I,'' he flatly replied.
When Democrats win in Nebraska, it's generally by running as far as they reasonably can from the national party. During the time I watched Kerrey campaign, his stump speech was constantly evolving, but he never failed to praise George H. W. Bush, whom he called ''a wonderful president.'' And while he says he supports Obama, Kerrey is sharply critical of the president.
''I think he misjudged the nature of the 2008 election and misdiagnosed the economic problem we were facing,'' Kerrey told me. ''And I think he gave Congress too much authority on the stimulus, and way too much of that was wasted.'' Kerrey would preserve the president's health care law, but he's frustrated at having to defend it. ''I shouldn't be the one explaining to Nebraskans what's in the Affordable Care Act,'' he said. ''What's it been, two years? It's a sign of a problem created not by me but by the man who's the primary architect of the legislation. They just did a terrible job of explaining it.''
Although he favors raising taxes on the rich, while also lowering some corporate rates, Kerrey disdains the current populist rhetoric that pervades the left and praises the generosity of the rich. ''My view is that the jerks in our society are evenly divided among all income categories,'' he said. ''I think it's important for rich people, especially on the Democratic side, to hear someone say thank you.'' I found myself wishing someone would give Bob Kerrey a speaking slot at the Democratic convention, just so I could experience a packed arena going dead quiet.
Most striking, perhaps, is Kerrey's contempt for the leadership of both parties in Washington, which makes him sound like some 1920s prairie populist. One of his central proposals calls for a constitutional amendment that would ban party caucuses in Congress and establish nonpartisan elections for the House and Senate, much like the unusual system that has governed Nebraska's Legislature since 1934. The amendment, as Kerrey envisions it, would also eliminate the unlimited campaign donations made permissible by the Supreme Court. Practically speaking, what all of this would mean, he says, is that there would be no ''party line'' to follow but rather coalitions based on ideology or shared interests.
You might think all of this would unsettle the Democratic leaders who lobbied Kerrey to run in the first place. It really doesn't, though, because the chief goal of both parties is to hold power. Control of the Senate after November's elections will most likely come down to a margin of one or two seats, and Republicans and Democrats are defending territory where they're at a natural disadvantage. Republicans, for instance, are trying to keep a tenuous hold on seats in Massachusetts and Maine. And in addition to Nebraska, Democrats are scrambling to defend seats in Missouri, Montana and North Dakota, all of which stand a better-than-even chance of falling into Republican hands. What party leaders care about is recruiting a candidate who's well known and who can raise a ton of money, so that even if that candidate doesn't win, he will at least force Republicans to spend precious time and resources on a state they'd rather be able to take for granted.
All of which means that Kerrey could run around Nebraska calling for a constitutional amendment to reinstate the British crown, and Harry Reid would probably shrug and go back to eating lunch.
If you manage to get yourself elected, of course, those expectations tend to change. When I asked Kerrey if he was really serious about slashing trillions of dollars from entitlement programs or trying to start a movement to ban party caucuses -- given that proposals like that would surely sour his relationship with senior Democrats -- he blinked at me for a moment. ''My guess is they'll think my proposals are wrong,'' he said. ''So we have an argument, that's all. Nobody's going to die. Nobody's going to haul me across the river and shoot me, like Burr did Hamilton.''
This more or less summarizes the attitude that Kerrey and his fellow veterans brought to the Senate in decades past. However divisive the rhetoric became, there was some sizable cadre of senators on each side of the aisle that brought a sense of perspective to the debate; they understood the difference between losing a vote, or even your seat, and losing your life.
What Kerrey seems not to fully grasp about the current Senate, no matter how many of his friends warn him, is how little perspective can be found in the place. Most lawmakers in both the House and Senate behave as if losing power and the perks that come with it really does amount to dying, and so they're wary of making concessions on any major issue that might irritate their most ideological activists and donors.
Nowhere is the resistance to old-school compromise more glaring than in the case of the so-called Gang of Six, which includes a member of the Democratic leadership (Richard Durbin) and one of the Senate's most conservative Republicans (Tom Coburn). The gang has a rough framework for reducing the debt by something like $4 trillion, both by cutting entitlement spending and by rewriting the tax code; it's not fully worked out, but it's enough to serve as a rallying point for the center. More than a dozen Republican senators were initially supportive of the plan, but when Obama embraced it and conservatives like Rush Limbaugh erupted, virtually all of them backed away. Democrats have been more open to making some painful trade-offs, but even so, the party's top senators have been mostly hostile to the gang's work, and only four Democrats have tentatively joined.
Kerrey is adamant about enacting a bipartisan debt-reduction deal like the one the gang has proposed. When I asked him why he thought he could achieve what others have failed, he said, ''I've actually given this a fair amount of thought,'' and then he let me in on his theory of success. ''It's got to be somewhat larger. You've got to get it to the 10-, 12-senator range. At that point, you can start to have an impact. ''
This didn't seem especially revelatory. I pointed out that the nominal leaders of the Gang of Six -- the Democrat Mark Warner and the Republican Saxby Chambliss -- had been working to enlist more senators since the beginning, against their parties' wishes, and so far had managed to expand the core group to eight, or maybe nine, senators, depending on the week. Did Kerrey think the gang had selected the number six because it had a nice, cozy feel to it?
''Well, look, you may have to use back-bench tactics,'' Kerrey said, undeterred. By this he presumably meant the kind of procedural hurdles more often deployed in the House, whereby lawmakers -- most famously Newt Gingrich in the 1990s -- get their way by holding up votes and paralyzing the body. ''You may have to be more militant. You may have to use the same tactics that the extremes are using in order to shut things down. It's got to be that people take you seriously, and it's either going to be that they take you seriously because they respect your views or because they're afraid of you. And frankly, I prefer the second when it comes to actually getting something done.''
It's easy enough to mock this vision of guerrilla moderates taking over the Capitol. (''We're going to act like children until you start cooperating like adults!'') And yet if Kerrey manages to get himself elected, his timing may not be as bad as it seems.
A few Democratic senators I spoke with expressed hope that, despite Lugar's defeat in Indiana, the Tea Party fervor that gripped Congress last year was ebbing, which would give Republicans more room to negotiate on cuts and taxes. In recent weeks, the two sides have come together to support measures on such issues as extending the Export-Import Bank and streamlining drug approvals. ''There has been a shift,'' New York's Charles E. Schumer told me. ''Is it on the most pressing issues of the moment, like debt and taxes? No. But it's not post-office namings, either.''
And if it turns out that more senators are willing to challenge their own parties' orthodoxies in the year ahead, then what a re-emerging center of the Senate will most likely need, even more than an expanded quorum or a specific agenda, is leadership -- an elder statesman with national standing to play something like the role McCain played in the early part of the last decade, someone who can threaten to ''shut things down'' and be taken seriously. ''Bob is, in the most constructive sense, an iconoclast,'' Michael Bennet, Colorado's junior senator and a friend of Kerrey's, told me. ''He would instantly be a leader of people who want to pull this place back together again.''
In April 2001, about four months after he left the Senate, Kerrey saw his darkest secret explode into public view. In this magazine, and in an accompanying segment on ''60 Minutes,'' the journalist Gregory Vistica reported that while in Vietnam, Kerrey led his SEAL team on a mission in which more than a dozen unarmed women and children were massacred. The revelation set off protests at the New School, and although Kerrey spoke about the issue at length and later served on the commission that investigated the terrorist attacks of 2001, it also seemed to preclude his return to elective office.
Toward the end of one of our conversations, I asked Kerrey if he thought Fischer or any of the outside groups would use his war record against him. Kerrey shrugged and said he was prepared if they did, and then to my surprise, he tried to explain, at some length, how he thought the episode had changed his life.
''We're not the worst thing we've ever done in our lives, and there's a tendency to think that we are,'' he said. We were sitting alone on a patio in back of a coffee shop in Fremont, accompanied by chirping birds. ''People now look at me differently. They look at me more for who I really am, as opposed to this glamorous war-hero, Medal-of-Honor-recipient narrative that I don't think is truthful. To see me as somebody who may have done something heroic but also did something that was terrible, I think helps people adjust in their own lives to their own attitudes about war and bad behavior. Because we're not perfect people.''
I asked if that meant he was at peace with what had happened at Thanh Phong in 1969, and he shook his head. ''No,'' he said, almost inaudibly. ''No. No.
''There are times when I'm overwhelmed by sadness. There are times when it's almost like I'm having a heart attack. Yeah, there are times when I still feel the pain of that night. It's been very difficult. And in some ways it's a motivation to run for Senate. It contributes to my wanting to be a candidate, as opposed to it being a deterrent. Because I haven't been able to do much about it since I talked about it.
''When I say I feel like I have a duty to serve,'' Kerrey said, looking directly at me, ''I have a duty to serve.''
Spend enough time around politicians, and you will find that their personal motives are hard to discern or disentangle. Perhaps, as Kerrey seemed to be suggesting, he feels a need to ''do something'' about the past, to ensure that he is not remembered for the worst thing he ever did. There's no doubt, too, that Kerrey, like just about all aging politicians of a certain caliber, feels he has unfinished business, things he wanted to achieve in office but didn't. And unlike most aging politicians, he's being offered the chance -- begged, really -- to go back and finish what he started.
It's a good bet, though, that had Kerrey hung around the Senate for another term or come back to Washington as Hollywood's lobbyist, he wouldn't be a candidate now. It's his very distance from the disillusionment that is driving so many of his former colleagues to leave, his detachment from their daily sense of futility, that makes him think he can matter again. Bob Kerrey runs not despite his long absence from Washington, but because of it.

HEADLINE: What A Real External Bank Bailout Looks Like

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Texas, back when. 

 BODY:
Update: some unemployment data added, below.
Something I've been looking at: Texas after the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s.
The cleanup from that crisis cost taxpayers about $125 billion (pdf), back when that was real money. As best I can tell, around 60 percent of the losses were in Texas (pdf). So that's around $75 billion in aid -- not loans, outright transfer. 
Texas GDP was about $300 billion in 1987. So this was equivalent to giving -- not lending, not even taking an equity stake -- Spain 25 percent of its GDP to bail out its banks.
And in the US it wasn't even treated as an interstate political issue.
Update: Not incidentally, Texas had a nasty special recession in the late 1980s, even as unemployment was falling nationally, partly driven by falling oil prices, but also driven by the collapse of the S&L bubble. Here are the numbers:
I think you can make a strong case that if Texas had been an independent country in 1986-87 it would have experienced a huge financial and fiscal crisis.

HEADLINE: Index Ventures Raises $442 Million in New Fund

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The European venture capital firm has raised $442 million to invest in early stage start-ups in both Europe and the United States. 

 BODY:
LONDON - The European venture capital firm Index Ventures has raised 350 million euros ($442 million) to invest in early stage start-ups in both Europe and the United States.
The announcement comes despite bleak prospects for Europe's economy, which continues to suffer from the Continent-wide financial crisis. 
The venture capital industry also has been affected. Firms in Europe have raised $2.1 billion so far this year, a 58 percent drop compared to the same period last year, according to the data provider Thomson Reuters. Fund-raising for North American venture capitalist firms has fallen 52 percent over the same period.
Index Ventures, which is headquartered in Geneva with offices in London and San Francisco, will focus its new round of fundraising on early stage start-ups on the West Coast, New York and several burgeoning tech hubs across Europe.
Recently, cities like London and Berlin have become centers from entrepreneurs specializingin industries like technology, financial services and fashion. 
Earlier this year, Index raised a 150 million euro fund ($189 million) in collaboration with GlaxoSmithKline and Johnson & Johnson to invest in life science start-ups. In late 2011, the firm also raised 500 million for a new fund focused on later-stage investments.
Danny Rimer, a partner at Index Ventures, said the new fund-raising would be aimed at companies working in a small number of sectors, including mobile, commerce and cloud computing.
"We continue to look for companies that have global ambitions," Mr. Rimer said, adding that the fund-raising was completed in less than two months at the beginning of the year. "In the end, start-ups can pop up from anywhere."
Index has previously backed a flurry of successful European start-ups, including Skype and the Internet radio station last.fm. And despite the Continent's current financial problems, Mr. Rimer said the crisis still provided opportunities for entrepreneurs.
One of Index's portfolio companies called Peopleperhour, an online community for freelancers and small businesses, for example, recently relocated its 50-person engineering department to Athens. The move was to take advantage of the local pool of qualified engineers that currently cannot find work because of the country's economic problems.
"They were able to scoop up the best people," Mr. Rimer said.

HEADLINE: Romney Doesn't Say Whether He Would Overturn Obama Immigration Order

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Appearing on CBS's 'Face the Nation' on Sunday, Mitt Romney was equivocal about overturning President Obama's order. 

 BODY:
Responding to the challenge that President Obama posed in his order last week to stop deporting some illegal immigrants, Mitt Romney declined to say on Sunday whether he would reverse the president's decision if he takes up occupancy of the White House.
Although Mr. Romney said during the Republican primary debates that he would veto the Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants, he was more equivocal about Mr. Obama's order last week. It allows work permits and prevents deportation for as many as 1.4 million undocumented immigrants not more than 30 who were brought to the United States as children.
"With regards to these kids who were brought in by their parents through no fault of their own, there needs to be a long-term solution so they know what their status is,'' Mr. Romney said on "Face the Nation" on CBS.
Echoing Republican lawmakers, Mr. Romney accused the president of a purely political move in issuing the order and bypassing Congress. "If he felt seriously about this," Mr. Romney said, "he should have taken action when he had a Democratic House and Senate, but he didn't."
The president supported passage of the Dream Act in 2010, but it was blocked by Republicans in the Senate.
Mr. Obama was in danger of losing the enthusiasm of Hispanics, a crucial voting bloc, over immigration policies that have focused on deportations.
The president put Mr. Romney on the defensive, and may have pre-empted him on a solution to illegal immigration that he was edging toward -- an embrace of a Republican alternative to the Dream Act proposed by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida that would offer work visas to some immigrants, but not a path to citizenship.
Advisers to Mr. Romney had said in recent days that he was working on a platform that would include immigration policies, and they expected him to unveil them on Thursday when he speaks to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Florida.
Ana Navarro, an adviser on Hispanic issues to Senator John McCain in 2008, said in a Twitter message on Sunday: "After Obama move, it's time. Romney NALEO speech Thurs is I-Day.''
Mr. Romney, granting his first interview to a Sunday morning news show other than on Fox News, told Bob Schieffer of CBS that the president also failed to work in a bipartisan way on health care, and he said that he would bring a different spirit to the White House.
"I'm really not a guy that's going for the next step in my political career,'' he said. "I am in this race because I want to get America back on the right track. I don't care about re-elections, I don't care about the partisanship that goes on. I want to get America right.''
Concerning another big news story of the day, the European economic crisis, Mr. Romney said he favored a hands-off approach. "Well we're not going to send checks to Europe,'' he said. "We're not going to bail out the European banks.''
He said the best economic defense for the United States was to strengthen its own economy and blamed the president for policies that have "made it harder for our economy to reboot.''
Mr. Romney was skeptical about another round of monetary stimulus, known as QE3, from the Federal Reserve, which is reported to be on the table for discussion when the Fed meets this week.
He reiterated economic proposals familiar from the primary season -- lowering tax rates and cutting government from 25 percent of the economy to 20 percent, which he said would "ignite growth.''
Pressed by Mr. Schieffer to cite tax deductions and exemptions that he would cut to maintain the progressivity of the tax code, which Mr. Romney has pledged, he said, "Well, we'll go through that process with Congress.''
Mr. Romney is midway through a six-state bus tour of small towns meant to connect him with everday Americans. Mr. Schieffer mentioned an alternative image of Mr. Romney from Saturday: the success of a dressage horse that his wife, Ann Romney, co-owns. The horse, Rafalca, won a berth on the United States Olympic team.
"I joke that I'm going to send her to Betty Ford for addiction to horses,'' Mr. Romney said.
An earlier version of this post about the Obama administration's new policy allowing some younger immigrants to avoid deportation and obtain work permits misstated part of the age qualifications established by the new rule. It applies to people who came to the United States as children and were no more than 30 years old - in other words, younger than 31 - when the policy was changed by the administrative action last week. It is not restricted to people who are less than 30 years old.

HEADLINE: Campaigns Turning Focus to Borders

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The politics of immigration seems likely to play a big role in the campaign this week. 

 BODY:
OBAMA IN MEXICO: Mr. Obama left on Sunday for Los Cabos, Mexico, for the G-20 summit meeting of the world's major economies.
Topics other than immigration are likely to dominate the two-day meeting: the economic crisis in Europe, a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and the political and military crises in Egypt and Syria.
But the location of Mr. Obama's trip provides the backdrop for a discussion of immigration between Mexico and the United States. And by announcing his new deportation policy just days before arriving, Mr. Obama all but ensured that it will come up in discussions with other leaders and with reporters.
What he says in Mexico will immediately echo on the campaign trail, where Mitt Romney has already criticized Mr. Obama's new policy. But on Sunday, Mr. Romney dodged the question of whether he would repeal it if he got into the White House next year.
"What the president did - he should have worked on this years ago," Mr. Romney said on "Face the Nation" on CBS. "If he felt seriously about this, he should have taken action when he had a Democrat House and Senate, but he didn't. He saves these sort of things until four and a half months before the general election."
THE COURT: Any day now, the Supreme Court is expected to announce its decision on the constitutionality of an Arizona law that expanded the powers of police officers in the state to enforce immigration laws.
The decision could have far-reaching implications for illegal immigrants. A ruling upholding the law could be seen as a green light for other states to follow suit. If the court strikes the law down, it may help immigration activists who say Arizona went too far.
On the campaign trail, either decision could supercharge the issue. Mr. Romney must contend with conservative supporters who do not want him to embrace amnesty or comprehensive immigration reform. Mr. Obama faces Hispanic voters already suspicious of his commitment to the issue.
For months, both candidates have largely sidestepped the issue (though they have each released ads in Spanish). A Supreme Court decision will be hard to ignore.
DUELING SPEECHES: But perhaps the most direct engagement on the issue of immigration is likely to come at the end of the week, when Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are both scheduled to deliver remarks to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials annual conference in Orlando, Fla.
Mr. Romney is scheduled to go first, addressing the group on Thursday. It will be an opportunity him to expand - or not - on his response to Mr. Obama's new immigration policy.
It will be a tricky moment for Mr. Romney, who appears to be trailing Mr. Obama badly among Hispanic voters. Several top aides have said he must find ways to narrow that gap. But doing so too aggressively could undermine his support among conservatives.
For Mr. Obama, who is to speak on Friday, the appearance is likely to be less contentious because of his new policy on deportations.
Some Latino supporters have expressed frustration with the president for not pushing harder to achieve a comprehensive immigration overhaul that would provide a pathway to citizenship for many of the illegal immigrants already in the country.
That may still be an undercurrent on Friday. But many Hispanic activists have cheered his new policy, making it more likely that he will be received warmly at the event.

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: The volatility of white working class voters explains quite a bit about our political life. 

 BODY:
Over the past few decades, working class whites - loosely defined as those without college degrees - have been a strikingly reliable indicator of the strength of the two main political parties. These voters are highly volatile and their shifting loyalties are a powerful factor in determining control of Congress and of the White House, according to recently re-analyzed exit poll data provided to the Times by Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory, and Sam Best, a political scientist at the University of Connecticut.
Take a look at the fluctuating level of support white non-college voters gave to Democratic congressional candidates between 1984, when exit polls first asked respondents about their level of education, and 2010:
In effect, the white working class vote is a barometer.
When this once reliably Democratic constituency moves away from the party by large margins, Democrats lose. In 1984, when Ronald Reagan crushed Walter Mondale, working-class whites backed Republican House candidates over Democrats by 57.1 to 41.9, a 15.2 point difference. In 1994, when Republicans swept to power in both the House and Senate, the Republican margin of support among working class white voters was 21.2 points, 60.6 to 39.4. In 2010, another Republican landslide year in House elections, the margin among whites without college degrees was 20.6 points, 55.3 to 34.7.
Conversely, when working class whites view Republican House candidates less favorably, Democrats do well. In 1986, Democrats regained control of the Senate when they split the votes of whites without college degrees, 49.4-50.6, a difference of just 1.2 percentage points. In 1990, when Democrats picked up seven House seats and one Senate seat, the white working class cast a relatively strong 7.8 point majority for Democratic House candidates, 53.9-46.1. In 1992, with Bill Clinton at the top of the ticket, a majority of these voters again supported House Democratic candidates, 52.7-47.3.
The correlation between support from working class whites and Democratic victory suggests that the party takes a great risk when it downplays the importance of this segment of the electorate, as some strategists are wont to do.
Interestingly, the same barometer effect is not apparent in the voting pattern of whites with college degrees. For 13 elections over 26 years, according to the data provided by Abramowitz and Cash, these college-educated voters have stayed within the 40 to 50 percent range: the Democratic - Republican split in House voting among whites with college degrees scarcely changes over time, and is far less determinative than the gyrations among the white working class.
Although firmly Democratic, African American voters can also shift sharply. The Democratic Party depends heavily on black support, of course, but its electoral success or failure does not correlate with black margins in the same way that it does with those of the white working class. Black Democratic margins were high in two disastrous years, 1984 and 1994 - perhaps in response to the threat of Republican ascendance - and in the victorious election of Obama in 2008. Black margins of support for Democratic House candidates were at their lowest in two relatively good years for the party, 1990 and 1996 - perhaps because Democratic victory seemed secure.
Exit poll and related data also reveals that the Democratic Party has shown a tendency to pick presidential nominees who run relatively poorly among white working class voters. These candidates include Adlai Stevenson, Walter F. Mondale, Michael S. Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, and, famously, Barack Obama.
Regarding Stevenson, who lost to Dwight D. Eisenhower twice in 1952 and 1956 (in the last pair of consecutive elections to feature the same candidates for both parties), Larry Bartels, a political scientist at Vanderbilt University, collected data that tracks presidential voting by whites without college degrees in elections from 1952 to 1980. Stevenson lost decisively among these voters, in contrast to John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Jimmy Carter (in 1976), who all did well. Another Democrat who helped boost House Democratic voting among working class whites was Bill Clinton, both times around.
Obviously, the rejection of many Democratic presidential nominees by whites without college degrees is relevant to Obama's prospects on Nov. 6. In 2008, Obama lost white working class voters by a landslide, 18 points, although he did 5 points better than Kerry. For Obama, the trick will be to avoid falling into the Stevenson-Mondale-Dukakis trap, and to place himself more in the tradition of Kennedy, Johnson and Clinton. It will not be easy.
The white working class has become the lynchpin constituency of conservative Republicanism. As a group, they can be often be relied upon to vote for the candidate on the right by far higher margins than college-educated whites.
Abramowitz included the following chart in his recent book, "The Polarized Public? Why Our Government Is So Dysfunctional." It shows the decline, over time, of Democratic loyalties and the parallel rise in Republican allegiance among three core New Deal constituencies: southern whites, northern white working class voters and northern white Catholics.
Could it be any clearer? These trends would clearly be disastrous for the Democratic Party - except for two well-documented counter-developments: first, the white working class is declining steadily as a share of the electorate; and second, Democrats have made huge gains in a previously Republican constituency, well-educated white professionals, many with advanced degrees.
"America in 1940 was an overwhelmingly white working class country," Abramowitz and Ruy Teixeira wrote in a 2008 Brookings Institution report, "The Decline of the White Working Class and the Rise of a Mass Upper Middle Class:" 
In that year, 86 percent of adults 25 and over were whites without a four year college degree. By 2007, with the dramatic rise in educational attainment and the decline in the white population, that percentage was down to 48 percent.
But just as the white working class is now a smaller share of the electorate, Republican margins in this cohort have been getting larger, compensating for the decline in group size. In the five congressional elections of the 1990s, the Republican Party won an average of 52.3 percent of the House vote; in the six elections from 2000 to 2010, Republicans won 58.7 percent.
The defection of these voters was crucial to the ability of the Republican Party to enact legislation - especially tax laws - that favor the affluent; working class support gave the Republican Party protection from charges that it advocated only for the rich and for the material interests of corporate America.
At the same time, the loss of white non-college voters has diminished pressure within the Democratic Party to address the dislocations resulting from globalization and automation, especially the loss of low-to-medium-skill jobs that paid high wages to workers without college degrees.
The result is that the Democratic Party has failed to develop a coherent or consistent set of policies to address what is now the dominant issue of the day, the violent restructuring of the American economy, which can be seen from many angles: in the continuing after effects of the financial collapse of 2008; in the rise of inequality; in the decline of social and economic mobility; and in the devastating $49,100 drop in average family wealth, from $126,400 in 2007 to $77,300 in 2010, a 39 percent drop of net assets in just three years.

HEADLINE: Africa's Hidden Water Wealth

BYLINE: By ALAN MacDONALD. 
Alan MacDonald is a principal hydrogeologist at the British Geological Survey.

 BODY:
Edinburgh
FOR a continent where more than 300 million people lack access to safe drinking water, Africa is sitting on a lot of it.
The journal Environmental Research Letters recently published a set of maps of groundwater resources in Africa, the results of two years of research led by the British Geological Survey and financed by the British Department for International Development. The research showed that in Africa the volume of water naturally stored underground within the cracks and pores of rocks is much larger (possibly 20 times more) than the 8,000 cubic miles of water visible in lakes and rivers. This water holds enormous potential to help people and nations move out of poverty, produce more food and better adapt to climate change. But it also could lead to tensions between neighboring countries.
At least 45 transboundary aquifers have been identified in Africa so far, and competition sometimes leads to serious tensions. However, since groundwater moves very slowly (usually less than three feet per day), shared aquifers should be seen as vehicles for cooperation, rather than competition, and identifying and characterizing the aquifers is the first step. 
Recognizing this, in December 2011 the United Nations General Assembly called upon its members to begin working toward a common goal: the effective management of their shared groundwater resources.
At the moment, the main constraint on supplying safe drinking water is lack of money. If there is sufficient investment in investigating groundwater, and water wells are carefully sited, it is usually possible to drill a well that can provide enough safe water for communities at a reasonable cost. Groundwater responds slowly to droughts and floods and, as a result, is much more resilient to climate variability than water supplies drawn from rivers or ponds. Therefore, serious and sustained investment in water wells and pumps will help provide a reliable and secure water supply to a significant number of those without safe drinking water.
Money on its own, however, will not solve drinking-water problems. About 30 percent of Africa's water wells are no longer operational, so donors like the World Bank, the Gates Foundation and the United States Agency for International Development need to get serious about maintenance and sustainability of services. New water supplies tend to gravitate to the better off, so investment in new services should be aimed at more remote areas where many of the poorest live; and with increased groundwater use comes the need for more qualified and experienced people to develop and manage the resource.
A major concern is that people may use the groundwater for whatever seems like a good idea at the time in a way that is unsustainable. There is much discussion about food insecurity in Africa, and at first glance irrigation based on groundwater seems like the perfect answer. However, it is not that simple. Our maps show that away from the large aquifers under the Sahara there are not many places where you can drill a water well and expect to pump out enough water to sustain center pivot irrigators like those in Nebraska. A potential compromise may be to encourage small-scale irrigation using lower yielding water wells. This approach will also require significant investment in expertise within Africa in groundwater development and governance and in reducing the costs of drilling and pumps.
And what about all that water under the Sahara? As inviting as it is, unfortunately this fossil water is not that easy to get at, requiring expensive, deep water wells and large pipelines to move the water to where people need it. Libya is the one country to have invested heavily in using Saharan groundwater, having spent some $20 billion to supply water to the coastal cities and for irrigation.
We should not be distracted by the large aquifers below the Sahara and dreams of cross-continental pipelines. The priority must be to serve those who still have to take unsafe drinking water from ponds and holes in dry riverbeds -- and to do this sensibly and sustainably. We should get on with the job of getting drilling costs down and construction standards up and supporting and developing groundwater professionals in Africa. Then we can concentrate on helping communities, small towns and whole nations to sustainably develop and protect the groundwater under their feet.

HEADLINE: Worried Banks Resist Fiscal Union

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
The seemingly endless series of euro zone crises has European officials pushing for a banking union that would watch over and bind together the currency group's faltering financial institutions.
But for Europeans, there seems to be little appetite for such a compact right now. In fact, banks and their national regulators, anxious about the Greek elections and Spain's hastily arranged bailout, are behaving more parochially than ever.
That poses a threat to the interbank lending across borders that is crucial to maintaining liquidity -- the free flow of money that is the lifeblood of the global financial system.
French and German banks have clamped off much of the lending to their counterparts in Italy and Spain, which in turn are primarily giving loans to their own debt-laden governments. 
And in Madrid, even after European finance ministers agreed to a 100 billion euro, or $125 billion, rescue of Spain's failing banks, the always proud Spanish government is insisting that it -- and not Brussels bureaucrats -- will take charge of how and where the funds are deployed.
With interbank cooperation at perhaps its lowest level since the creation of the euro currency union, European officials say they are moving toward a broader solution.
Experts warn, though, that what is needed now is not another working paper proposing new levels of euro bureaucracy, but a clear action plan that addresses the root issue: markets and investors have lost faith in Europe's ability to regulate its banks.
''Why do you think European banks won't lend to Spanish banks?'' asked Karel Lannoo, chief executive of the Brussels-based Center for European Policy Studies and an expert on bank regulation in Europe. ''Because they do not trust Spanish regulators. Has Citigroup stopped lending to California? No. What we need is a single banking supervisor and a single settlement system like in the United States. And we have no time to lose.''
Top officials at the United States Treasury and the International Monetary Fund have also been warning for more than a year that there can be no easy resolution to the euro crisis until Europe solves its banking problem.
Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt -- right now the closest thing the euro zone has to a banking coordinator -- said Friday that he and top European Union officials in Brussels would present a master plan for the euro project in a matter of days.
A blueprint is only that, however. Substantial changes that would affect banks and national budgets would probably require treaty changes and voter approval. That process could take many months and there is no guarantee of success.
As part of the push, the European Commission published proposals this month that would include creation of a Europe-wide banking supervisor whose oversight powers would trump those of local regulators.
And to discourage the flight of bank deposits from weaker countries, a problem that has plagued Greece and now Spain, the European Commission proposed a deposit insurance fund for the entire euro zone, analogous to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the United States. Individual euro zone member nations already have deposit insurance. But the Spanish fund, for one, is nearly insolvent.
Under the Brussels proposal, a new banking regulator would also have the authority to share the financial pain of bank bailouts by forcing some holders of the bonds of bailed-out banks to absorb losses.
Hoping to impose such changes sooner than formal treaty revisions would allow, Mr. Lannoo of the Center for European Policy Studies proposed an elegant solution in a recent paper.
He says there is already an article in the European Union treaty (Article 127.5, to be exact) that would let the European Central Bank take on supervision of euro zone members' banks, provided that the finance ministers of the 17 countries that use the euro approve such a step unanimously. That would be faster than getting the approval of 17 national governments.
And it would be in tune with a global trend of giving central banks ultimate responsibility for bank safety, while giving the European Central Bank the ability to spot and address banking disasters in countries like Ireland and Spain before they become a Europe-wide threat.
But even if support was gathering for greater banking consolidation in Europe, there would be political obstacles.
For one thing, putting the European Central Bank in charge would neuter the London-based European Banking Authority, which was set up by Brussels to oversee European banks. Although the authority has been widely ridiculed for its toothless stress tests that missed banking fiascos in Ireland and Spain, entrenched bureaucracies are seldom easy to eliminate.
Even as the policy debate proceeds, nervous European banks have been slashing their short-term loans to Italy and Spain at a time when those banks, which depend largely on such loans to survive, are desperate for capital.
French loans to Spanish banks plunged 34 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared with the previous quarter, according to the latest data from the Bank for International Settlements.
For Italian banks, French bankers cut their exposure by 16 percent. German banks have also been increasingly wary of their Italian and Spanish peers, reducing lending to them by about 19 percent last year.
More recent data, once available, are almost certain to show even tighter purse strings, analysts say.
In the last six months, as fears about Spain and Greece have intensified, Spanish and Italian banks have been by far the biggest users of the European Central Bank's program of cut-rate, three-year loans to banks that cannot find money elsewhere.
But instead of funneling that money back into the Spanish and Greek economies as loans to cash-starved businesses and individuals, these banks have become the primary buyers of their governments' bonds. That has perpetuated a nasty cycle in which the problems of the government become the problems of its banks, and vice versa.
''What we are seeing is a localization of risk in Europe,'' said Alberto Gallo, a senior credit strategist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in London. ''Or, a reverse integration of financial and banking markets. And as this continues, it will be much harder to go back to normal.''
In many ways, the extent to which Brussels is committed to going beyond words and working papers will be tested soon in Spain. Even though Europe has agreed to lend Spain money to fix its banks, Spanish government officials continue to resist European advice on how to proceed.
For example: When Joaquin Almunia, the Spanish-born European Union commissioner for competition, said recently that at least one Spanish bank might need to be shut down, officials in Madrid rejected his suggestion. In some quarters, Mr. Almunia's patriotism was even questioned.
Most delicate will be whether the Spanish banks receiving the largest cash injections, like the nationalized mortgage giant Bankia, will be forced to impose losses on holders of their subordinated bonds. Those are the investors whose bonds are not backed by collateral and are thus considered more risky.
Such a ''bail-in'' feature is a central plank of Brussels's banking union plan, and it is widely supported by industry experts because it would punish investors for taking undue risks. In Ireland, those types of bondholders were wiped out when Irish banks were recapitalized.
In Spain, though, the problem is that 62 percent of the holders of Bankia's subordinated debt are Spanish individual investors, not overseas hedge funds and investment banks. It is not likely that Madrid will be willing to hit those citizens with a 65 percent loss -- the loans are currently priced at about 35 cents on the dollar -- at a time of 25 percent unemployment in the country.
It is too early to know whether Brussels will override Spanish political considerations and force such a write-down as a condition for lending bailout money. If it does not, doubts will continue over Europe's ability to deliver a banking union plan with real authority.
''There are compelling reasons for the euro zone to insist on losses for subordinated and even senior bondholders, the least of which is a reduction in moral hazard,'' said Adam Lerrick, an expert on banking and sovereign debt at the American Enterprise Institute. ''Losses for bondholders is now euro zone policy, so Europe's credibility is also at stake.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senate Hopefuls Compete in a TV Debate

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
The three Republicans hoping to challenge Senator Kirsten E. Gillibrand fought to stress their differences in a televised debate on Sunday, seeking to draw attention to a primary campaign that has provoked little enthusiasm among voters.
All three candidates stuck to broad Republican themes like reducing spending and improving the business climate in New York and the country. But an hour of questions brought out several distinctions on issues, including taxes and same-sex marriage, that are important to the right-leaning voters who are coveted in a Republican primary election.
The debate, at the NY1 studio in Chelsea, was moderated by Errol Louis and Liz Benjamin, who host nightly political programs on the NY1 and the YNN cable networks, both of which broadcast the program. It came a little more than a week before the June 26 primary, for which experts expect a very low turnout. 
The best-known candidate in the field, Representative Bob Turner, who last year won the Brooklyn and Queens seat previously held by Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat, fielded criticism from his opponents for not ruling out tax increases. He has not signed the antitax advocate Grover G. Norquist's pledge to oppose all such increases, unlike his opponents, Wendy E. Long, a Manhattan lawyer, and George Maragos, the Nassau County comptroller.
Ms. Long asked Mr. Turner to defend his stance that raising taxes should be on the table in negotiations over reducing the country's budget deficit and debt.
''You know where I stand on this: I just think that we can't ever put those on the table,'' Ms. Long said. ''Your willingness to put them on the table sounds to me sort of like the policies of Barack Obama and Kirsten Gillibrand.''
Mr. Turner, noting that the White House and the Senate were held by Democrats, struck a tone of practicality and said that for anything to get done, ''we're going to have to talk it out.''
''I'm not going into the negotiations -- and I don't think any Republican should go into the negotiations -- and say, 'This is how it's going to be,' '' he said.
Mr. Maragos, who accused his opponents of ''continued indecision'' in defining their stances on tax issues, did not talk of compromise. Asked how he would work with Democrats in Washington like Senator Charles E. Schumer, he pivoted to discussing his decades of business experience in the financial industry.
''I think I would start by trying to teach some of our Congress people some economic theory,'' Mr. Maragos said. ''Unfortunately in Congress we have a lot of attorneys but very few economists and very few business people.''
Mr. Turner was puzzled. ''I think George's suggestion that we school Senator Schumer in economic reality would be an interesting challenge,'' he said.
Over all, the debate showcased far more policy similarities than differences -- all three candidates said they supported hydraulic fracturing, for instance. But they tussled ever so slightly even in areas where they agreed, like same-sex marriage.
Mr. Maragos criticized Ms. Long for not publicly advocating the repeal of same-sex marriage in New York. Ms. Long said that was not her role, given that she was not a state lawmaker, but Mr. Maragos pressed further, saying it was her duty, since she had the backing of the State Conservative Party -- a distinction that Ms. Long has eagerly publicized.
Mr. Turner was not eager to discuss the subject. ''This ship has sailed in New York,'' he said. ''I want to keep the focus on jobs and the economy. The Gillibrand record, the Obama record -- that's what this is going to be about.''
In a lightning round of questions, Ms. Long said she would refuse to attend a same-sex wedding on principle. Mr. Maragos said Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was a better mayor than Rudolph W. Giuliani; Ms. Long and Mr. Turner, who has Mr. Giuliani's backing, said they favored Mr. Giuliani.
Asked if they would report to federal authorities a worker in their home who they found out was an illegal immigrant, Ms. Long and Mr. Maragos said yes; Mr. Turner said, ''Probably not.''
The debate gave the candidates a chance to draw contrasts with one another, which they have struggled to do in recent weeks. A Siena College poll conducted this month found that 70 percent of Republican voters did not favor a candidate.
''Whichever campaign does a better job of identifying their core voters and getting them to the polls, that campaign wins,'' said Steven A. Greenberg, a Siena pollster.

HEADLINE: A Jazz Museum Grows Up

BYLINE: By ROBIN POGREBIN

 BODY:
The fourth-floor space on East 126th Street does not look anything like a museum.
Flourescent-lighted and largely bare, the room appears to be an office but for a weathered grand piano that sits in the middle of the floor and a few faded photographs that adorn the walls.
But the National Jazz Museum in Harlem, one of the city's lesser-known cultural lights, has never really been about its artifacts. 
It has always been about the music: the improvisational genius of Charlie Parker, the percussive piano of Thelonious Monk, the elegant stylings of Duke Ellington.
The music draws some 7,500 people to the building each year for free programming like Jazz for Curious Listeners, which explores the history of jazz or Harlem Speaks, an interview series with musicians, artists, writers and community leaders.
And these days visitors also come for Jonathan Batiste, a gangly pianist from New Orleans who at 25 has become one of the museum's biggest draws. He was recently named its associate artistic director and is part of a team charged with transforming the institution from a side street diversion into a Main Street attraction.
In about three years the team, which includes Loren Schoenberg, the museum's artistic director, and Christian McBride, a bassist, is scheduled to open a new 10,000-square-foot home for the museum in the former Mart 125 across from the Apollo Theater on 125th Street.
The building will be shared by retail stores and by ImageNation Soul Cinema, which runs an independent film festival. The New York City Economic Development Corporation, which selected the museum for the site two years ago, is working with the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone to secure a development partner for the remaining space in the building. The city has contributed $10.5 million toward the $19 million project, bringing the total raised so far to $13.5 million. Of 47,000 square feet in the building, 17,000 will be devoted to cultural space.
''Hopefully it will make the programming they provide much more accessible to people,'' Kate D. Levin, the New York City cultural affairs commissioner, said. ''It will also telegraph the importance of this art form and the many ways it has impacted our culture.''
Though young and small (it was founded in 1997, has a full-time staff of just seven and an annual operating budget of $1.3 million) the museum has several advantages. It is an affiliate of the Smithsonian Institution, which means it can borrow from the Smithsonian's collection of musical artifacts (for an annual fee of $2,500). It had a prominent founder: Leonard Garment, a former jazz musician who served as counsel to President Richard M. Nixon. It possesses some landmark recordings, like the prestigious Savory Collection of discs transcribed from Depression-era radio broadcasts, featuring some of the biggest names in jazz.
And its board members include the horn player Wynton Marsalis and the documentary filmmaker Ken Burns.
Still, hurdles remain. Fund-raising remains tough for arts institutions. And jazz has powerful pop culture forces to overcome. Many people consider it the music of a bygone era; jazz doesn't get much airtime on the radio and is barely a presence at the Grammys. That's why Mr. Batiste said he carves out time for the museum in his crowded performing schedule -- to educate people about the music he loves.
''People have grown up without hearing jazz music, except when they're in an elevator,'' he said in an interview. ''A lot of the time you just have one shot. It's not something they're seeking out. When delivered to them, it has to be palatable.
''The music will speak for itself once you break those stereotypes. You can't get what you can get out of jazz from any other kind of music. You have to open up to the music. The music doesn't come to you, you have to come to it.''
Mr. Schoenberg, a jazz scholar, said Mr. Batiste's commitment and outsize talent made him stand out as a student in Mr. Schoenberg's jazz history class at the Juilliard School several years ago. ''He didn't, just like a robot, play it back,'' Mr. Schoenberg said. ''He interpreted it.''
Having started working with the museum in 2008, Mr. Batiste helped create the program Jazz Is: Now! in which his Stay Human Band plays and he deconstructs jazz, walking people through the theory and history of the music, often with the help of guests, who have included the fiddle player Mark O'Connor and the bassist Ben Williams. ''The next thing we knew, we had over 100 people a night,'' Mr. Schoenberg said.
Mr. Batiste grew up in New Orleans in a family of musicians, though he can't even remember precisely how he's related to some of them, like Alvin Batiste, the jazz clarinetist, and Milton Batiste, of brass band fame. ''You kind of just soak it up,'' he said. ''You see what each person has to offer.''
In the same way, he wants to educate people about the music at the museum, to show them that it isn't just about glorifying the greats of the past but can also involve reinventing sounds for today, making jazz relevant.
So in his classes he invites audience members to come up with arrangements on the spot or to play an instrument or to write one word on a piece of paper that describes a performance ''to get an understanding of how music can represent different things to different people,'' he said. One time a 6-year-old with no musical experience came up with his own take on Monk's ''Green Chimneys.''
Mr. Marsalis said of Mr. Batiste, ''I love his philosophical direction, his playing, his creativity and his love for kids.'' The institution wants to counter the notion that jazz is somehow intimidating, inaccessible. In the new museum live music will be playing all the time, its officials say, as if to say just listening is all that really matters.
''There's a snobbish mentality in the jazz scene where people think if they don't know a pile of history or who played on what record they can't have an opinion about the music,'' Mr. Batiste said.
''It's about cracking the code,'' he added. ''And we're going to crack it.''

HEADLINE: Hearst to Give Elle Accessories a 2nd Chance

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
THERE are accessories for cars, accessories for gadgets, fashion accessories and even accessories to murder. Come fall, there will, again, be Elle Accessories.
Elle Accessories, devoted to fashion accessories like handbags, jewelry and shoes, was a spinoff of Elle magazine that was introduced by Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. in 2005 and closed in 2008. (Some overseas editions have continued to publish.) Hearst Magazines, which acquired Hachette Filipacchi Media U.S. last year, has decided to revive the American edition of Elle Accessories with the same frequency as before, twice a year, in spring and fall.
Hearst Magazines plans to print 500,000 copies of the fall 2012 issue, some to be bundled with the October issue of Elle and some to be sold by retailers like Barnes & Noble. Editions also will be published for e-readers like the Barnes & Noble Nook and for iPad tablets. 
Among the advertisers scheduled to appear is Neiman Marcus, which will run a 12-page insert created for the issue and collaborate with Elle Accessories on other initiatives, including online ads. Plans also call for copies of the issue to be mailed to 100,000 Neiman Marcus customers.
The return of Elle Accessories seems part of a nascent trend, as publishers plan to bring back fashion and lifestyle magazines like Best Life, from Rodale, and M, from the Fairchild Fashion Media division of Conde Nast Publications. Magazines like ForbesLife, from Forbes Media, and Pursuits, from Bloomberg, are expanding in availability and frequency.
The improving picture for such magazines reflects how well fashion and lifestyle marketers, particularly on the luxury end of the spectrum, have been prospering despite continuing economic woes and uncertainty.
''In 2008 and 2009 these businesses were so stressed,'' said David Carey, president of Hearst Magazines in New York, part of the Hearst Corporation.
''The high end today is very strong at retail,'' he added, ''and as a result is very strong for the magazines.''
Another factor favoring accessories is that ''sometimes it's an easier decision'' to buy shoes or a bag than a dress or coat, Mr. Carey said.
Kevin C. O'Malley, senior vice president, publisher and chief revenue officer of Elle, who also oversees Elle Accessories, called accessories ''a great point of entry'' for fashion marketers ''to engage consumers, to bring them into a brand's fold.''
Accessories are also helping accelerate the growth of e-commerce, Mr. O'Malley said, because they are often easier to order online than clothing.
''Why?'' he asked rhetorically, then answered, ''No fit issues.''
No thought was given to bringing the magazine back under a different name, Mr. O'Malley said, because ''there's great equity in Elle and there's great equity in Elle Accessories.''
Mr. O'Malley and Roberta Myers, editor in chief of Elle, were inspired to consider resurrecting American Elle Accessories after speaking with fashion houses last fall ''in Milan, Paris, London,'' he said.
Ms. Myers said: ''People asked if we were bringing it back, when were we bringing it back. We think now is the most opportune moment to reintroduce it.''
A one-time, four-color ad page in Elle Accessories will cost about $28,000, compared with $148,270 in Elle.
Neiman Marcus was interested in the issue because ''we all knew Elle Accessories from before and felt it's a great complement to what we're already doing'' like catalogs, said Mia Meachem, vice president for marketing for the Neiman Marcus Stores division of the Neiman Marcus Group in Dallas. Asked about the outlook for the economy, Ms. Meachem said, ''Fall is a long time away.'' She added, ''We're optimistic about fall, and are taking the right steps to reach our customers.''
Barnes & Noble plans to do more for the comeback of Elle Accessories than sell print copies and offer it on Nooks.
There will be ''a huge splash,'' said Theresa Thompson, vice president for newsstand at Barnes & Noble in New York. Plans include promotional banners in stores and e-mail ''that will go out to our customers and our digital customers, linking to a digital boutique page'' on Barnes & Noble's Web site where visitors can order subscriptions and watch video clips.
''Elle is one of our biggest brands,'' Ms. Thompson said, ''and Hearst is one of our strongest publishers.''
In addition to planning the return of Elle Accessories, Hearst has been busy introducing magazines: Cosmopolitan for Latinas, Food Network Magazine, HGTV Magazine and Marie Claire@Work, a supplement to Marie Claire, which Hearst publishes in the United States in a venture with Marie Claire Album.
''One of Frank Bennack's favorite lines,'' Mr. Carey said, referring to the chief executive of the Hearst Corporation, ''which he reminds me of often, is, 'If you're not growing, you're falling behind.' ''
''We love new ways to express what we do,'' Mr. Carey said. ''There are other things percolating through the organization. So if you ask me if more of these are coming out of Hearst Tower, the answer is yes.''

HEADLINE: In Its First Life, an Oil Platform; In Its Next, a Reef?

BYLINE: By MELISSA GASKILL

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- The dormant oil platform known as High Island 389-A rises out of the Gulf of Mexico about 100 miles southeast of Galveston. Below the surface, corals, sea fans and sponges cover its maze of pipes. Schools of jack and snapper, solitary grouper and barracuda circle in its shadows. Dive boats periodically stop at the enormous structure, where dolphins, sea turtles and sharks are often spotted.
Now, 30 years after it was built and months after it was abandoned, it is set to be demolished under Interior Department rules governing nonproducing ocean structures. And when it goes, the lush ecosystem that has grown around it will also vanish. There are now about 650 such oil and gas industry relics, known as idle iron, that may meet this fate. 
The federal government estimates that the blasts needed to remove one platform kill 800 fish, although others who have observed the process put the number in the thousands. Much of the marine life on or around the structure dies, either from the explosions to separate the platform from its supports or when it is toppled or towed to shore and recycled as scrap metal.
The prospect of losing so much life has brought together an unusual collection of allies hoping to convert High Island and many similar structures into protected reefs. ''These structures attract marine life that normally wouldn't use the area,'' said Greg Stuntz, chairman of ocean and fisheries health at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies at Texas A&M University Corpus Christi. ''Much is growing on them, from corals up to marine mammals.''
A typical four-legged platform becomes the equivalent of two to three acres of habitat, according to estimates by government scientists.
The Interior Department gives owners of nonproducing platforms one to five years to remove them, depending on the status of their drilling lease and where they are located. High Island's owner has until January to act. The platform, built in 1981, falls within the 56-square-mile Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary, one of 14 federally designated underwater areas protected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Office of National Marine Sanctuaries and the only such area in the Gulf.
Interior cites legitimate concerns about the potential for spills from old wells and the risk and expense of removing structures damaged or toppled by storms as reasons for taking them out. The department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement reports that 265 platforms were removed in 2011. Several people in the industry said that 150 or more of the 650 on the list are scheduled for removal in 2012; the bureau has received 158 removal applications so far this year.
But campaigns to save them are under way. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council --which oversees fishery resources in the Gulf's exclusive economic zone, an area 9 to 200 miles off the Texas coast where the federal government has jurisdiction over resources and economic matters -- is seeking recognition of offshore platforms as essential fish habitat. That designation could bring into play the Sustainable Fisheries Act, which prohibits removal of protected corals from federal waters. Gov. Rick Perry and a Texas congressman, Blake Farenthold, have asked the Interior Department to re-evaluate the removal rules, as has a coalition of seven recreational angling organizations, including the Coastal Conservation Association. The coalition is supporting legislation to require more thorough review of platform removal.
John Hoffman, chief executive of Black Elk Energy, an oil and gas company based in Houston, has founded a nonprofit organization, Save the Blue, that would help insure and maintain platforms that are spared removal.
Saving what lies beneath the platforms matters, said Jim Smarr, chairman of the Texas chapter of the Recreational Fishing Alliance.
''We've done more damage to the Gulf ecosystem destroying these rigs than what recreational fishermen did in decades,'' he said. The shrimp season was cut short because of concerns about the number of red snapper caught in shrimp nets, Mr. Smarr said, and with recreational fishing on a 60-day season, ''we have shrimpers and fishing guides going out of business because of supposed shortages of red snapper. Yet it doesn't bother them to blow up rigs and kill more than our total annual catch every time.''
Efforts are also under way to save High Island 389-A. Earlier this year, W & T Offshore, the oil and gas acquisition and exploration company that owns the platform, told G. P. Schmahl, superintendent of the Flower Garden Banks sanctuary, that the company would prefer to convert High Island to an artificial reef. If the plan is approved, the structure would likely be removed down to 85 feet below the water surface, as required under a federal rigs-to-reefs program. W & T officials did not respond to requests for comment.
Sanctuary officials said they were ''comfortable'' with a partial removal, but were concerned over liability and maintenance issues.
Last month, the Flower Garden Banks advisory council voted unanimously to request a moratorium on High Island's removal until at least September 2013.
To convert the platform into a reef, operators must have plans approved by the Interior Department's Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and obtain permits. An environmental assessment is required for removal, and Mr. Schmahl says that because High Island stands within a sanctuary, NOAA must also weigh in.
All of that takes time. So those hoping to save the platform have some breathing room -- and at the very least, a chance for another dive. ''Some people say High Island is their favorite dive in the sanctuary, and it is an exhilarating experience,'' Mr. Schmahl said. ''The number of fish can be overwhelming. It's like no other kind of diving.''

HEADLINE: World Leaders Meet in a Mexico Now Giving Brazil a Run for Its Money

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN and SIMON ROMERO; Elisabeth Malkin reported from Mexico City, and Simon Romero from Rio de Janeiro.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Mexicans looked on with envy in recent years as Brazilians won a reputation as Latin America's chosen people. With a surging economy and a prominent place on the world stage, Brazil was the country poised for greatness while Mexico remained mired in bloodshed and destitution.
But just as momentum can change suddenly in a match at the World Cup or an event at the Olympics -- both competitions that Brazil will host in the next four years -- so can the dynamics between nations.
Last year, Mexico's economy grew faster than Brazil's, and it looks set to outpace its larger Latin rival again in 2012. 
Brazil's slowdown can be attributed partly to debt-burdened consumers and the erosion of industrial production, which is tied to the recent strength of Brazil's currency, the real. On top of that, slowing global growth, particularly in China, has pushed down prices of the commodities that Brazil exports.
Meanwhile, Mexican factories are exporting record quantities of televisions, cars, computers and appliances, replacing some Chinese imports in the United States and fueling a modest expansion.
Economically, Mexico does not appear as grim a place anymore.
''The best way to improve your image is G.D.P. growth,'' said Luis de la Calle, a former Mexican trade negotiator and an economic analyst here.
Mexico's strengthening economy underlies the glossy veneer on display as President Felipe Calderon hosts the Group of 20 leaders of major industrialized and emerging economies at the luxury beach resort of Los Cabos on Monday and Tuesday.
In contrast to the widening crisis in the euro zone, which will be the focus of the talks, Mexico will be able to point to 17 years of macroeconomic stability, low inflation, manageable debt, an open economy and increasing competitiveness. The gross domestic product expanded 3.9 percent last year, ahead of Brazil's growth of 2.7 percent.
And there are encouraging signs for the years ahead. Nissan, Mazda and Honda all announced that they would build new plants in Mexico, and new investments in aerospace and electronics are also on the horizon.
''Stars appear to be increasingly aligned for an economic outperformance'' by Mexico, a report in May from Nomura Securities concluded. ''A changing of the guard is slowly but surely taking place.''
The reversed fortunes of Latin America's two largest economies are a sharp contrast to the euphoria over Brazil's prospects as recently as 2010, when the economy grew 7.5 percent in the last year of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government.
''The years of good growth are clearly in the past,'' said Antony Mueller, a professor of economics at the Federal University of Sergipe in Brazil.
In one sign of unease, the Brazilian government threatened this year to cancel a 10-year-old automotive trade accord with Mexico. For most of the pact's life, Brazil had sent more cars to Mexico, but last year that reversed, with imports of Mexican-made cars surging 70 percent to $2.4 billion. In March, Mexico agreed to cut its exports to Brazil to an average of $1.55 billion annually for the next three years and restore free trade after that.
The dispute highlights each country's distinct approach to development. Mexico has been dedicated to open markets, free trade and deregulation. Brazil's model involves muscular government intervention through big state-controlled companies.
At the same time, China's rise has affected Brazil and Mexico in opposite ways: China competes with Mexico and buys from Brazil. Mexico struggled for much of the past decade as Chinese-made products replaced Mexican goods in the United States, which buys 78 percent of Mexico's exports. And China's demand for raw materials helped lift Brazil's economy as stability allowed the government to redistribute the wealth and expand credit.
''Brazil has had two powerful narratives,'' said Gray Newman, an economist for Latin America at Morgan Stanley. ''If you believe in China, you believe in Brazil. That counted for a lot. The second narrative is that 'We've become a normal country and created the conditions for the emergence of a middle class.' Those narratives are so powerful.''
Mexico's story has not been as positive, Mr. Newman said, with its fortunes tied to the United States and the government engaged in a war against powerful drug gangs. Even with the tide turning in their favor, Mexicans are so gloomy they do not see it, analysts say.
''This self-flagellation in Mexico is a malady,'' said Mr. de la Calle, who argues against the conventional wisdom and describes Mexico as a middle-class country. ''When I said, 'You are not as badly off as you say you are -- there is a reason to have hope for the future,' the argument that I got back was that Brazil is doing much better.''
Indeed, the candidate who leads in opinion polls ahead of Mexico's July 1 presidential election, Enrique Pena Nieto, began a recent presidential debate by asking people if they were better off and answering the question himself: ''Surely, no.''
One reason for the malaise is Mexico's drug war. The sight of miles upon miles of factories outside the industrial capital of Monterrey attracts far less attention than the image of nine bodies hanging from a bridge in the border city of Nuevo Laredo. Mexico's Finance Ministry has estimated that the violence shaves at least 1 percentage point from G.D.P. growth.
Even though Brazil's homicide rate trumps Mexico's, the gory nature of the killings in Mexico and Mr. Calderon's use of the military to combat traffickers have focused more attention on the death toll here.
And Mr. Pena Nieto is correct that growth has yet to trickle down to many workers. Real wages have barely increased. Indeed, one reason that Mexico has captured market share from China is the narrowing gap between Chinese and Mexican wages.
Brazil and Mexico probably have more in common than their supposed rivalry would suggest. Each has stabilized its economy after decades of veering from crisis to crisis and improved the well-being of many of its citizens.
In Brazil, ''the dividends of what it did in the 1990s paid off with a political transition dovetailing with commodity prices,'' said Lisa M. Schineller, a Latin America analyst for Standard & Poor's. ''It all came together.''
Now the two countries also face many of the same problems: inadequate schools, creaky infrastructure, bureaucracy and corruption.
Mexico's political paralysis has stopped it from taking effective measures to break up monopolies, rewrite labor laws, collect more taxes and pry open the world's most closed oil company, changes that would add 2.5 percentage points to its growth rate, the Mexican Institute for Competitiveness estimated.
The question is how these middle-income countries find a way to advance further, said Shannon K. O'Neil, a Latin American analyst at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''Trying to move from G.D.P. per capita of $5,000 to $10,000 is much easier than moving from $10,000 to $20,000,'' she said. ''I think that's the challenge that both face.''

HEADLINE: Greece As Victim

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Ever since Greece hit the skids, we've heard a lot about what's wrong with everything Greek. Some of the accusations are true, some are false -- but all of them are beside the point. Yes, there are big failings in Greece's economy, its politics and no doubt its society. But those failings aren't what caused the crisis that is tearing Greece apart, and threatens to spread across Europe.
No, the origins of this disaster lie farther north, in Brussels, Frankfurt and Berlin, where officials created a deeply -- perhaps fatally -- flawed monetary system, then compounded the problems of that system by substituting moralizing for analysis. And the solution to the crisis, if there is one, will have to come from the same places. 
So, about those Greek failings: Greece does indeed have a lot of corruption and a lot of tax evasion, and the Greek government has had a habit of living beyond its means. Beyond that, Greek labor productivity is low by European standards -- about 25 percent below the European Union average. It's worth noting, however, that labor productivity in, say, Mississippi is similarly low by American standards -- and by about the same margin.
On the other hand, many things you hear about Greece just aren't true. The Greeks aren't lazy -- on the contrary, they work longer hours than almost anyone else in Europe, and much longer hours than the Germans in particular. Nor does Greece have a runaway welfare state, as conservatives like to claim; social expenditure as a percentage of G.D.P., the standard measure of the size of the welfare state, is substantially lower in Greece than in, say, Sweden or Germany, countries that have so far weathered the European crisis pretty well.
So how did Greece get into so much trouble? Blame the euro.
Fifteen years ago Greece was no paradise, but it wasn't in crisis either. Unemployment was high but not catastrophic, and the nation more or less paid its way on world markets, earning enough from exports, tourism, shipping and other sources to more or less pay for its imports.
Then Greece joined the euro, and a terrible thing happened: people started believing that it was a safe place to invest. Foreign money poured into Greece, some but not all of it financing government deficits; the economy boomed; inflation rose; and Greece became increasingly uncompetitive. To be sure, the Greeks squandered much if not most of the money that came flooding in, but then so did everyone else who got caught up in the euro bubble.
And then the bubble burst, at which point the fundamental flaws in the whole euro system became all too apparent.
Ask yourself, why does the dollar area -- also known as the United States of America -- more or less work, without the kind of severe regional crises now afflicting Europe? The answer is that we have a strong central government, and the activities of this government in effect provide automatic bailouts to states that get in trouble.
Consider, for example, what would be happening to Florida right now, in the aftermath of its huge housing bubble, if the state had to come up with the money for Social Security and Medicare out of its own suddenly reduced revenues. Luckily for Florida, Washington rather than Tallahassee is picking up the tab, which means that Florida is in effect receiving a bailout on a scale no European nation could dream of.
Or consider an older example, the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s, which was largely a Texas affair. Taxpayers ended up paying a huge sum to clean up the mess -- but the vast majority of those taxpayers were in states other than Texas. Again, the state received an automatic bailout on a scale inconceivable in modern Europe.
So Greece, although not without sin, is mainly in trouble thanks to the arrogance of European officials, mostly from richer countries, who convinced themselves that they could make a single currency work without a single government. And these same officials have made the situation even worse by insisting, in the teeth of the evidence, that all the currency's troubles were caused by irresponsible behavior on the part of those Southern Europeans, and that everything would work out if only people were willing to suffer some more.
Which brings us to Sunday's Greek election, which ended up settling nothing. The governing coalition may have managed to stay in power, although even that's not clear (the junior partner in the coalition is threatening to defect). But the Greeks can't solve this crisis anyway.
The only way the euro might -- might -- be saved is if the Germans and the European Central Bank realize that they're the ones who need to change their behavior, spending more and, yes, accepting higher inflation. If not -- well, Greece will basically go down in history as the victim of other people's hubris.

HEADLINE: Extending the Drama of Track and Field Year Round

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Later this week athletes will converge on Eugene, Ore., for the United States track and field trials, which begin in earnest on Friday. An estimated 1,000 athletes will compete for roughly 135 spots on the United States Olympic team in what some call the greatest 10-day drama in sports: a concentration of great athletes in a competition where every step, every throw, every jump has no margin for error.
''The Olympic trials are better than the Olympics or the world championships,'' said E. Garry Hill, the executive editor of Track and Field News.
''It's just a delightful 10 days of nothing but track and field; that's all anyone thinks about multiple times a day,'' said Hill, who has been with the magazine since 1969 and has covered Olympic Games since 1972. ''There is joy there, sadness, just the full gamut of emotions.'' 
But even with such a glamorous showcase in a sport that is a highlight of the Summer Games, track and field, with all of its history, will probably not raise its profile beyond the closing ceremonies. The sport will suffer the fate of swimming and gymnastics, which produce Olympic stars but little in the way of lasting illumination for their sport.
Max Siegel wants to change that. He is the new chief executive of USA Track and Field, the national governing body for the sport.
''I believe that there are things we can do on a year-to-year basis to keep the sport relevant and not have it viewed by the general public as a once-in-every-four-year sport,'' he said last week.
Siegel previously served as president of global operations at Dale Earnhardt Inc., where he sold millions of dollars in sponsorships.
''I'm not naive enough to think that we can go head to head with the N.B.A. or the N.F.L., but I certainly think we can create a lot of awareness, increase our viewership significantly,'' Siegel said.
In fact, the drama around the sport is made for TV.
Track and field is a battle of stamina and will waged in close quarters by fierce competitors. The rivalries that emerge have created many lasting moments -- triumphant or agonizing -- that appeal to the general public.
Stephanie Hightower was involved in such a dramatic moment during the 1984 Olympic trials. Hightower, a past president of USA Track and Field and now the executive director of the Columbus Urban League, was one of the dominant hurdlers of her era.
After an outstanding career at Ohio State, Hightower was primed to compete in the 1980 Olympics in Moscow when President Jimmy Carter called for a boycott. Four years later, Hightower was favored to win a gold medal at the Los Angeles Games. But in the finals of the trials she finished in what appeared to the naked eye to be a four-way tie. After an agonizing review, Hightower, the American record holder, was judged to have finished fourth -- one spot short of making the team.
''I feel the anxiousness when people don't make the team that I think should have or we thought were going to,'' Hightower, who is chairwoman of USA Track and Field's board, said. ''I cry just like they do. My heart is just as low and painful as theirs is because I've been there, done that.''
Hightower, understandably distraught, made some angry comments at the time that in today's 24-7 news cycle would have been turned into a tempest.
If a controversial result like Hightower's unfolds in Eugene or in London, USA Track and Field should use it as grist for a reality-style, made-for-TV rematch. If LeBron James could pull great ratings for ''The Decision,'' track and field should be able to sell grudge matches that exist or can be manufactured.
For a marketing maven like Siegel, track and field is at an ideal place in time. We are in a period of American history when shamelessness and vanity sell. If track and field hopes to raise its profile, the sport should exploit the rancor, the tension, the seething need for revenge and retaliation that have become intrinsic parts of our national character.
In a star-driven nation like the United States, any sport that hopes to succeed needs a star or a high-profile villain. But the challenges facing track and field in the United States are greater than merely finding a star.
Track and field, like boxing and horse racing, is trying to find a place for itself in a complex, competitive American sports marketplace. Unlike boxing and horse racing, track and field is connected to contemporary culture. We are a nation of runners. The challenge for track's leadership is how to fit all runners -- and the enthusiasm for running -- under one gigantic roof.
In a 2010-11 survey by the National Federation of State High School Associations, outdoor track and field had the second highest participation among high school boys (579,302). For girls, outdoor track and field was the top sport with 475,265 participants. ''What we don't do a very good job of is, once we get them is how we keep them,'' Hightower said. ''How do we engage people, keep them engaged, in the sport? The sport is not holding their attention.''
Hightower said that when she was coming up, there were numerous running clubs and the national federation helped build them. ''Somewhere along the way, and I don't know where it happened, clubs just went away,'' she said.
''We've been operating in too many silos in the sport,'' Hightower said. ''You have your track and field people and then you have your weekend warrior kind of folks. It's time for us to figure out how we can all come together and collaborate as opposed to working in silos. We've got to come up with new, creative ways and ideas to present the sport to the American public.''
Siegel agrees with Hightower that a primary focus of USA Track and Field must be community and youth development. Young arms and legs are part of the sport's salvation.
''From a marketing platform and a commercial partnership standpoint, I think the economy has shifted where people are really getting back into grass-root support and connecting their message at a local and a regional level,'' Siegel said.
Track and field needs stars and spectacle. ''People identifying with the competitor and the star elevate the whole sport,'' Siegel said. But the sport needs American stars. Usain Bolt is the only star name in track and field in this country, but you can't sell the sport in the United States with an athlete who is not American.
Track in the United States needs a contemporary Carl Lewis, although just as a Triple Crown winner won't be enough to prop up horse racing, a star in track may not be enough by itself to make track a must-see event. The truth may be that no amount of marketing will restore track and field to its past place of primacy in the American psyche.
''The reality is that we're a niche sport,'' Hill, the Track and Field News editor, said. ''Do what you do well, find your target audience, which is small, and give them a good product.''
USA Track and Field has set a lofty goal for itself in London -- to win 30 medals, an increase from the 23 the United States won at the 2008 Beijing Games. Can the London Games produce a hero or heroine whom USA Track and Field can sell to the American public? More to the point, can track and field put the public in the mood to buy?

HEADLINE: Web Sites Illuminate Unknown Artists

BYLINE: By MELENA RYZIK

 BODY:
At twilight on Monday, something new will light up a Times Square billboard. An original work of art, 23 stories high, will replace a bright yellow ad for Sprint.
The artist whose work now gets a canvas Rembrandt could never have imagined is a substitute teacher from Allentown, Pa., who has made art for over 30 years but never had the backing of a major museum or gallery. Her creation will loom over Times Square because she won an online contest in which users of a Web site gave her more votes than 35,000 competitors.
The site, ArtistsWanted.org, is not a charity but a business, one that hopes to make a profit identifying artistic talent and connecting it to an audience. Investors are pouring millions into it and similar start-ups and social networks like Behance.net and EveryArt.com, which cater to the growing cadre of people who consider themselves creative and think there's a market for their work outside the network of galleries and dealers who dominate the commerce in art and design. Users and founders of these sites talk not only about making money but also about democratizing culture. 
As these platforms proliferate, they also raise questions about the nature of art and creativity, the distinction between professionals and hobbyists and what it means to call yourself an artist when anyone with a cellphone can be a photographer, anyone with the right apps can be a designer, anyone with a Facebook page can amass a following, and anyone at all can dream up a concept and find a place to pitch it.
''The value of the creative industry, the value of creative talent, has become more appreciated over the past few years,'' said Mukti Khaire, an associate professor at Harvard Business School. ''The fact that the Web creates opportunities for discovery and showing that nothing else could on that scale -- I think it does change who gets to be an artist,'' added Ms. Khaire, who studies the creative fields. ''It may not change the definition, but it widens the funnel.''
William Etundi Jr., a founder and chief executive of Artists Wanted, is banking on that mass tech-enabled populace. ''As technology has made it easier for people to create things, more people become creators,'' he said, offering a sort of company motto. He started the site four years ago, with Jason Goodman, a founder of Third Ward, an art and design collective in Brooklyn, where Mr. Etundi, 33, planned events. They hosted artist calls and competitions, partnering with other businesses. As 60,000 users registered and remained engaged, Mr. Etundi sensed a larger opportunity. In February they raised $1.5 million from investors including OATV, which backed bit.ly and Foursquare, and Founder Collective, which invested in Art.sy and Vimeo. The ethos, Mr. Etundi said, ''is to inspire creative people to make works they wouldn't otherwise create, to give them an audience, to give them connection, to give them deadlines within competitions.''
In its venture-financed expansion, Artists Wanted, which now has a staff of 14, plans to run four competitions a year, letting the site's community pick the best contenders in art, photography, fashion and more but retaining the right to name the winner (as it did for Times Square). Its business plan is a mix of free and paid services, allowing users to post their work free but charging for deeper usage -- $25 to get your portfolio on the home page during a contest, say, or perks like after-party tickets. Its visitors quintupled from 41,000 in January to 208,000 in April, according to Nielsen, and it already has revenue -- $1.3 million last year, although it's not yet profitable, Mr. Etundi said.
Artists Wanted also has deep cultural connections. For its event on Monday unveiling the billboards in Times Square, Mr. Etundi enlisted Questlove, the drummer from the Roots, to host, from the pedestrian plaza on 43rd Street and to D.J. the after-party nearby. Through Chashama, the arts nonprofit founded by Anita Durst -- a scion of the Durst Organization, the developer that controls some Times Square real estate -- he got access to three major digital billboards (on the Nasdaq, Thomson Reuters and Port Authority buildings). The Times Square Advertising Coalition donated space on more than a dozen billboards, for a month. Also thanks to Ms. Durst and the real estate firm Rockrose, Mr. Etundi has a 4,800-square-foot office space in Long Island City, Queens -- complete with a gallery for his site's artists -- rent free for a year, with subsidized rates to follow. ''I believe Will -- his philosophies -- they help build the arts community in New York,'' said Ms. Durst, who met him a decade ago, when she frequented his loft parties. ''He really cares in a very heartfelt way.''
Still, Artists Wanted is entering into a competitive field. DeviantArt, the most popular art and graphics Web site, according to Nielsen, has 19 million members, many with a techno aesthetic. DIYers have Etsy; photographers have Flickr; everyone else has Pinterest and Tumblr.
Last month Behance.net, which bills itself as a platform for creative professionals, announced its first round of outside financing, $6.5 million led by Union Square Ventures, who were backers of Kickstarter and Etsy and who were impressed by this five-year-old site's recent growth. One million new works went online in the last six months, as many as in the company's first four years, said Scott Belsky, a founder of Behance. Emboldened by handy technology like the photo app Instagram, amateur users are scaling up, he said, while professionals, mindful of new competition, are broadening their skills.
Albert Wenger, a partner in Union Square Ventures, said these new sites represent a changing understanding of the artistic economy. ''What the Internet does is turn hobbies into things that are, in some instances, a global opportunity,'' he said.
The fine-art world has also recently made forays online, with sites like Art.sy, an art recommendation engine; Pictify, which allows users to post and ''collect'' images of Van Goghs and Monets; and EveryArt, where patrons commission artists.
With this avalanche of new creativity online, Jeffrey Deitch, the director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, argues that ''there is an increasing need for curators and connoisseurs to make sense of it for people.''
''I have not yet heard of an artist, like a painter or sculptor, in the mainstream of art becoming an Internet sensation,'' he added. ''It's not like Lana Del Ray, where a giant music star starts on the Internet.'' But he said the path for such a breakthrough was clearer for a conceptual or video artist.
For Vicki DaSilva, 52, the winner of the Artists Wanted ''Art Takes Times Square'' contest, the Internet has been her gateway. She first noticed an uptick of attention in 2009, after she started posting videos of her work, known as light graffiti, on YouTube. She was attracted to Artists Wanted because of ''their mission,'' she said, to give exposure to artists who were out of the mainstream.
''I feel like this is the perfect place for me,'' she said. Her winning entry, a multimedia piece with the words ''never sorry'' written in homage to the Chinese artist and dissident Ai Weiwei, earned her $10,000.
The money was appreciated, Ms. DaSilva said. But she was beyond thrilled at the prospect of seeing her work 23 stories tall on a city billboard.
''This is my Frank Sinatra, Jay-Z moment, my 'New York, New York' moment,'' she said. ''You can't get bigger than Times Square.''

HEADLINE: With Taxi Deal Blocked, the City's Budget Is in Flux

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg built a $1 billion bet into his proposed $68.7 billion budget proposal: that the city would be able to sell 2,000 new yellow taxi medallions as part of a plan to expand street hail service throughout the five boroughs.
But a judge's ruling two weeks ago temporarily blocking the taxi plan, on a jurisdictional question about whether such policy should be set by the Legislature or by the City Council, has thrown the budget into flux, with two weeks to go until the start of the next fiscal year on July 1. 
The conundrum is intensifying questions about whether the mayor was wise, in his effort to avoid raising taxes, to base a budget on a one-time revenue source that might not materialize. It has also become a flash point among the likely candidates in the 2013 race for mayor of New York.
Marc La Vorgna, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, expressed confidence that the lawsuit would be resolved shortly, and in the city's favor. But the mayor has warned that if the city cannot sell the new taxi medallions, many city jobs will have to be cut, and Mr. La Vorgna acknowledged that ''this has to be a factor in the discussions.''
Budget-watchers differed on the wisdom of relying on taxi revenue, and the potential impact of the court battle, in which the taxi industry is challenging the right of the Legislature to set new taxi policy for the city.
Nicole Gelinas, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, said that ''if the mayor's budget is so fragile that it is critically dependent on this $1 billion one-shot, as he has more or less said it is, then it wasn't a very good budget in the first place.'' And Doug Turetsky, a spokesman for the city's Independent Budget Office, said that even if the courts eventually allowed the medallions sale to proceed, it was not clear how much revenue it would produce.
James A. Parrott, the deputy director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, said that Mr. Bloomberg had good reason to assume that the medallion revenue would flow into city coffers, once Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and lawmakers had agreed to authorize the sale. But Mr. Parrott accused the mayor of not looking hard enough at increasing revenue from the city's highest earners -- a step advocated by one possible mayoral candidate, John C. Liu, the city comptroller. That could raise $600 million to $1 billion annually, Mr. Parrott estimated.
The debate among the mayoral candidates began when Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, urged a court to overturn the taxi bill, which he called an unconstitutional usurpation of the Council's powers. Mr. Bloomberg called the argument ''stupid,'' and then Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, declared that he would file a legal brief in support of the mayor. Mr. de Blasio and Mr. Stringer are positioning themselves to run for mayor next year.
Mr. Stringer, explaining his move, said that as a native of Washington Heights, he was aware of how difficult it could be to hail a taxi beyond Midtown Manhattan. And he said he feared that the loss of $1 billion in the budget would cause cuts to child care, libraries and other services. ''I don't want this lawsuit to be used as an excuse to wield a mighty ax that will gut programs New Yorkers rely on,'' he said.
Speaker Christine C. Quinn, who is also a likely candidate for mayor, has not said how she expects the Council to factor the uncertainty into budget negotiations, but the mayor's office said it believed the budget could be approved assuming the medallion revenue would come through, and then could be adjusted midyear if necessary.

HEADLINE: In a World of Complications, Obama Faces a Re-election Test

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For Barack Obama, a president who set out to restore good relations with the world in his first term, the world does not seem to be cooperating all that much with his bid to win a second.
That reality has been on vivid display in recent days. Europe has seemed unable to contain its rolling economic crisis to just Greece. The Syrian conflict has intensified as the United Nations suspended its observers' mission amid the violence. Egypt's popular revolution is at risk of being reversed by the military. And the Russians are cracking down at home and rattling sabers abroad.
As President Obama left on Sunday for an international summit meeting in Mexico, the daunting array of overseas issues underscored the challenges for an incumbent who is trying to manage global affairs while arguing a case for re-election. Although American voters are not particularly focused on foreign policy in a time of economic trouble, the rest of the world has a way of occupying a president's time and intruding on his best-laid campaign plans. 
If anything, the dire headlines from around the world only reinforce an uncomfortable reality for this president and any of his successors: even the world's last superpower has only so much control over events beyond its borders, and its own course can be dramatically affected in some cases. Whether from ripples of the European fiscal crisis or flare-ups of violence in Baghdad, it is easy to be whipsawed by events.
The trick for any president, of course, is in not seeming to be whipsawed, even as his challenger presents him as weak and ineffectual in shaping international events. If a president cannot stand tall in the world, the argument goes, he is not up to the task of governing in a complicated age.
''Both candidates have to pretend that the U.S. presidency is far more influential over events than it really is,'' said Stephen D. Biddle, a scholar at the Council on Foreign Relations. The obvious example is the European economic situation, which has profound implications for the American economy but is largely out of American hands.
''But to admit this is to look weak or to seem to evade responsibility,'' Mr. Biddle said. ''So both candidates tacitly agree to pretend that their policies are capable of righting the American economy while their opponent's would sink it, when the reality is that both are in thrall to foreigners' choices to a degree that neither would acknowledge.''
Mr. Obama's trip to Mexico for a gathering of the Group of 20 leaders is his third international summit meeting in a month, reflecting the pull of priorities for any incumbent. While he confers in Los Cabos, his Republican challenger, Mitt Romney, will tour swing states. ''I've still got my day job,'' as Mr. Obama put it at a California fund-raiser last month.
The president will talk with European leaders about pulling out of the financial spiral after Sunday's election in Greece, which gave the pro-bailout party a slim victory and the right to form a coalition government. He will also meet with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia just days after the Obama administration accused Moscow of supplying arms to Syria in its bloody crackdown on the uprising there.
Just as Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin meet for the first time as presidents, their underlings will sit down in Moscow for the latest round of talks with Iran that are intended to curb Tehran's nuclear program. The optimism over these talks this spring seems to have faded into fears of a further impasse that would play into Iran's hands.
Little of this has played out on the campaign trail. In the latest New York Times-CBS News poll, only 4 percent of Americans picked foreign policy as their top election concern. Over all, polls show Mr. Obama with a double-digit advantage over Mr. Romney on foreign policy.
Yet Mr. Romney has occasionally turned to foreign policy to bolster his broader attempt to portray Mr. Obama as a failed president. On Saturday, he told a conservative coalition that when it came to Israel, he would ''just look at the things the president has done and do the opposite.'' On the CBS News program ''Face the Nation'' on Sunday, Mr. Romney said that on Iran ''I would be willing to take military action, if necessary, to prevent them from becoming a nuclear threat to the world.''
Some Romney advisers said Mr. Obama was too willing to avoid accountability by presenting himself as a powerless bystander.
''These crises reflect an absence of leadership from the Obama administration,'' said Kristen Silverberg, a former State Department official under President George W. Bush who is advising Mr. Romney. ''He sat out the Iran protests, has faltered on Syria and let the Russians know he'll be even more 'flexible' after our election. Global security and the strength of the global economy depend on strong U.S. leadership and a president who believes in America's role in the world.''
Jamie M. Fly, executive director of the Foreign Policy Initiative, a conservative group, said there was a growing sense ''that what is required is American leadership rather than the president's leading-from-behind foreign policy that has failed to address an imploding Syria, a nuclearizing Iran, an economic crisis in Europe and a revanchist Russia.''
While foreign policy can pose its challenges, it has advantages for a president. Flying around the world on Air Force One to meet with the likes of Mr. Putin conveys a statesmanlike stature. It allows him to brush off criticism as just politics, as his campaign did with Mr. Romney's comments about Israel over the weekend.
''Mitt Romney is yet again trying to score cheap political points by distorting President Obama's record of support for Israel,'' Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman, said in a statement. ''Our relationship with Israel is too important for Governor Romney to play politics with it.''
Mr. Obama assumes foreign policy will be an advantage for him, particularly because of his record of pulling troops out of Iraq, helping topple the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, taking robust action against terrorists and authorizing the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.
He is the ''first real national security Democrat'' since President John F. Kennedy, said James M. Goldgeier, dean of American University's School of International Service. ''He looks and acts like a commander in chief. So yes, the euro crisis, Syria, Iran, etc., can cause him problems. But Romney has his work cut out for him on foreign policy.''
Nancy E. Soderberg, a national security aide and United Nations diplomat under President Bill Clinton, says it is ''par for the course'' that an incumbent has to address international challenges while the challenger has a free ride.
But for all the attention on Syria, Egypt and other areas of conflict, the most important crisis for Mr. Obama remains the European economy because of its impact at home. ''Europe's weakness is likely to blow back on Obama's efforts this fall -- just at the wrong time,'' she said. ''He'll have to run harder because of it.''

HEADLINE: On TV, Romney Doesn't Show Immigration Hand

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
Responding to the challenge that President Obama posed in his order last week to stop deporting some illegal immigrants, Mitt Romney declined to say on Sunday whether he would reverse the president's decision if he takes up occupancy of the White House.
Although Mr. Romney said during the Republican primary debates that he would veto the Dream Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for some illegal immigrants, he was more equivocal about Mr. Obama's order last week. It allows work permits and prevents deportation for as many as 1.4 million undocumented immigrants under the age of 30 who were brought to the United States as children. 
''With regards to these kids who were brought in by their parents through no fault of their own, there needs to be a long-term solution so they know what their status is,'' Mr. Romney said on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS.
Echoing Republican lawmakers, Mr. Romney accused the president of a purely political move in issuing the order and bypassing Congress. ''If he felt seriously about this,'' Mr. Romney said, ''he should have taken action when he had a Democratic House and Senate, but he didn't.''
The president supported passage of the Dream Act in 2010, but it was blocked by Republicans in the Senate.
Mr. Obama was in danger of losing the enthusiasm of Hispanics, a crucial voting bloc, over immigration policies that have focused on deportations.
The president put Mr. Romney on the defensive, and may have pre-empted him on a solution to illegal immigration that he was edging toward -- an embrace of a Republican alternative to the Dream Act proposed by Senator Marco Rubio of Florida that would offer work visas to some immigrants, but not a path to citizenship.
Advisers to Mr. Romney had said in recent days that he was working on a platform that would include immigration policies, and they expected him to unveil them on Thursday when he speaks to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials in Florida.
Ana Navarro, an adviser on Hispanic issues to Senator John McCain in 2008, said in a Twitter message on Sunday: ''After Obama move, it's time. Romney NALEO speech Thurs is I-Day.''
Mr. Romney, granting his first interview to a Sunday morning news show other than on Fox News, told Bob Schieffer of CBS that the president also failed to work in a bipartisan way on health care, and he said that he would bring a different spirit to the White House.
''I'm really not a guy that's going for the next step in my political career,'' he said. ''I am in this race because I want to get America back on the right track. I don't care about re-elections, I don't care about the partisanship that goes on. I want to get America right.''
Concerning another big news story of the day, the European economic crisis, Mr. Romney said he favored a hands-off approach. ''Well we're not going to send checks to Europe,'' he said. ''We're not going to bail out the European banks.''
He said the best economic defense for the United States was to strengthen its own economy and blamed the president for policies that have ''made it harder for our economy to reboot.''
Mr. Romney was skeptical about another round of monetary stimulus, known as QE3, from the Federal Reserve, which is reported to be on the table for discussion when the Fed meets this week.
He reiterated economic proposals familiar from the primary season -- lowering tax rates and cutting government from 25 percent of the economy to 20 percent, which he said would ''ignite growth.''
Pressed by Mr. Schieffer to cite tax deductions and exemptions that he would cut to maintain the progressivity of the tax code, which Mr. Romney has pledged, he said, ''Well, we'll go through that process with Congress.''
Mr. Romney is midway through a six-state bus tour of small towns meant to connect him with everday Americans. Mr. Schieffer mentioned an alternative image of Mr. Romney from Saturday: the success of a dressage horse that his wife, Ann Romney, co-owns. The horse, Rafalca, won a berth on the United States Olympic team.
''I joke that I'm going to send her to Betty Ford for addiction to horses,'' Mr. Romney said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: For a Rangel Challenger, Voters' Opinions Are the Only Ones That Matter

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
An air of single-mindedness, and slight impatience, clings to Clyde Williams these days as he heads into the final week before voters go to the polls in the state's Congressional primary.
Mr. Williams, one of four Democrats challenging Representative Charles B. Rangel, knows he has a perception problem: the conventional wisdom is that Mr. Rangel's biggest threat comes from a different Democrat, State Senator Adriano Espaillat.
''That's fine with me,'' Mr. Williams said. ''My thing is, I need to talk to voters. They determine who will be elected.'' 
Mr. Williams and the other candidates are seeking to represent the 13th Congressional District, which stretches from East Harlem to the northwest Bronx. The district is overwhelmingly Democratic, so the winner of the primary is expected to be elected in November.
Mr. Williams has strong credentials -- he served as domestic policy adviser to former President Bill Clinton at his foundation and, more recently, worked for the Democratic National Committee -- but the district is now majority Hispanic for the first time, and Mr. Espaillat, who is Dominican-American, has been endorsed by several major Latino leaders in the city and by the Spanish-language newspaper El Diario.
But Mr. Williams said in an interview that he thought Mr. Espaillat's hold on Latino voters was being overestimated.
''The whole thing about 'Every Latino's going to vote for Espaillat,' I know it's not true,'' he said, noting that he had considerable support among the Puerto Rican community in East Harlem.
''I think part of the reason why it's been quote-unquote determined a two-person race is because people want to play the black and brown issue,'' he said. ''Espaillat's Latino, Charlie's the incumbent, I get that. But again, the people decide who becomes the representative.''
Mr. Williams grew up in Washington and got his start in politics working for John A. Wilson, a District of Columbia city councilman. He worked in the Clinton White House -- where he met his wife, Mona Sutphen, who was working for Sandy Berger, the national security adviser -- and as deputy chief of staff at the Agriculture Department.
In 2001, the couple moved to Harlem so that Mr. Williams could work for the Clinton Foundation. His task there was developing programs to help the local community; one that he started, in partnership with Booz Allen Hamilton and the New York University Stern School of Business, provided free consulting to small businesses.
Mr. Williams and Ms. Sutphen returned to Washington after the 2008 election, when President-elect Obama offered her a job as deputy White House chief of staff; Mr. Obama also appointed Mr. Williams to be the national political director at the Democratic National Committee. Last year, they left those jobs and returned to Harlem. Ms. Sutphen is now a managing director at UBS.
Warner Johnson, an Internet entrepreneur who lives in Harlem, said that ''as a businessman'' he believed that Mr. Williams was the best candidate.
''I have watched from a distance what he's done in Clinton's office and the efficacy of that,'' he said. ''He understands Washington, and it's all about getting things done -- it's all about results.''
At a recent gathering of mostly Puerto Rican women in East Harlem, Mr. Williams emphasized his experience in Washington and promised that, if elected, he would pay as much attention to East Harlem -- or El Barrio, as the women referred to it -- as to other parts of the district. He promised to address the high unemployment in the district, health care and the neighborhood's chronically underperforming schools.
''For too long this community has been treated as, for lack of a better term, as a stepchild to the rest of the Congressional district -- and I can assure you this will not be me,'' he said.
The women, for the most part, seemed impressed. ''I just have a lot of hope for this young man,'' said Ceci Aponte, 72, after listening to Mr. Williams take questions for half an hour.
Of his qualifications, she said, ''He's worked for Clinton, he's worked for Obama -- that's enough.''
Mr. Williams's campaign manager, Rakim Brooks, said he believed the campaign would be able to put together a winning coalition of new residents, older residents who are disillusioned with Mr. Rangel, Puerto Ricans and residents of the mostly white enclave of Hudson Heights.
Among the field of challengers, which also includes Joyce S. Johnson and Craig Schley, Mr. Espaillat has received most of the endorsements by political figures, but Mr. Williams has raised slightly more money, pulling in donations from Clinton family intimates like Maggie Williams, who managed Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign; current and former White House officials; and wealthy New Yorkers active in Democratic politics, like Cathy Lasry and Blair Effron. And on Saturday, Mr. Williams was endorsed by The New York Times.
Friends of Mr. Williams have also established a ''super PAC,'' Campaign for Our Future, to which Reginald Van Lee, an executive vice president at Booz Allen Hamilton, has contributed $75,000. So far the PAC has spent over $100,000, much of it on direct mail highlighting Mr. Rangel's lack of support from Mr. Obama -- who in 2010 suggested that Mr. Rangel should ''end his career with dignity'' -- as well as Mr. Williams's credentials.
''I thought this was a way for at least voters to be informed, so that they are fully aware of the options and choices,'' Mr. Van Lee said.

HEADLINE: Newspaper Work, With Buffett as Boss

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
BUFFALO -- Over the years, newspaper owners have built monuments to themselves in the form of giant buildings, statues and plaques commemorating their roles in their communities and the country at large. At the headquarters of The Buffalo News here, a sand-colored office building across the river from a fragrant Cheerios factory, the only visible sign of the owner is a small photograph hanging in the office of the publisher, Stanford Lipsey, signed, ''To the best in the business, Warren.''
Warren is, of course, the billionaire Warren E. Buffett, but the modesty of his physical presence at the paper -- he has not visited the paper in the last eight years -- understates his interest in the paper, which a unit of his company, Berkshire Hathaway, bought in 1977.
Mr. Buffett's views on newspapers have been a hot topic of late. Three years after telling his shareholders that he would not buy a newspaper at any price, Mr. Buffett has moved aggressively into the business, buying 63 papers and revealing a 3 percent stake in Lee Enterprises, a chain of mostly small dailies based in Iowa. 
In a letter Mr. Buffett sent to the publishers and editors of all Berkshire Hathaway daily newspapers, he described himself as a newspaper ''addict'' who planned to buy more papers in the future. While he is less certain how he will make papers profitable in the digital age, he is confident that in certain cities, newspapers will thrive.
''I do not have any secret sauce,'' Mr. Buffett said in a phone interview. ''There are still 1,400 daily papers in the United States. The nice thing about it is that somebody can think about the best answer and we can copy him. Two or three years from now, you'll see a much better-defined pattern of operations online and in print by papers.''
For his new employees, the best indicator of what Mr. Buffett may do is what he has done with The Buffalo News. Interviews with more than a dozen current and former editors paint a picture of a profitable paper that is run with little involvement from its owner. Some journalists say that the owner will hold out as long as possible to buy the latest printing presses and that they wish the paper dedicated more resources to the highly ambitious journalism that wins the biggest awards.
But many workers agree that the owner does not skimp on sending reporters to town meetings or on enterprising local journalism, which is in line with Mr. Buffett's belief in an intense local focus for papers.
''In Grand Island, Nebraska, everyone is interested in how the football team does. They're interested in who got married. They're maybe even more interested in who got divorced,'' Mr. Buffett said, adding that he was not interested in sprawling markets like New York or Los Angeles. ''If you live in South Central Los Angeles, you're not interested in who dies in Beverly Hills.''
But being owned by Berkshire Hathaway has not shielded The News from the industry's slump. In 2011, the union said newspaper officials had told them the paper earned a profit of $9.3 million, the first time the paper's profit fell below $10 million in a quarter-century.
To put this in perspective, Mr. Lipsey said The Buffalo News often reported annual profit in the 1980s of $55 million. Since 2009, nearly 100 full-time jobs were cut from the union -- which includes the newsroom and the classified, accounting, bookkeeping and circulation departments -- according to Henry L. Davis, the paper's health reporter and the president of Buffalo Newspaper Guild.
A stroll through the newsroom, which is dotted with potted plants, feels like a walk through a half-empty city park. Since 2009, the unionized staff members who remain have had a 1 percent raise.
The newsroom staff is now 140, from 200 about a decade ago, with cuts made mainly through buyouts rather than layoffs. Retirees have few complaints about the pension managed by Berkshire Hathaway especially since the maximum retirement payouts have been raised. So while union negotiations have been heated, highlighted by debates over who should pay for employee parking, newsroom employees still have their health benefits fully covered.
''We do kind of consider ourselves lucky,'' said Gene Warner, a reporter with the paper for 32 years who retired in 2010 and now works part time. ''We're not bleeding red ink.''
On top of the industry's tough climate, The News's home is a Rust Belt city that has suffered economically. Buffalo has lost 10 percent of its population every decade for the last 30 years, according to data tracked by the University at Buffalo Regional Institute.
''I hate to think of what Buffalo would be without a newspaper,'' said Lee Coppola, a reporter at the paper from 1967 to 1982 who went on to work in television, and then became a federal prosecutor and later was the dean of the journalism school at St. Bonaventure. ''I think Buffett has sheltered the city since he bought the paper, in a way. He has sheltered the paper. He spent millions and millions of dollars when newspapers were in decline.''
While the newspaper's circulation (now about 150,000 daily and 230,000 on Sunday) has dropped with the population, the residents still read the paper. According to data tracked by Media Audit, The Buffalo News has the second-highest penetration of any news organization in the nation. In other words, 70.9 percent of area households read or viewed The Buffalo News in the last month. The only news outlet with a higher number was The Des Moines Register, with 72.9 percent reading.
Brian Connolly, a managing editor involved with expanding the paper's online efforts, says he still sees papers delivered to two-thirds of the homes he passes on his morning jogs.
''That's still where a lot of the eyeballs are,'' Mr. Connolly said.
Mr. Lipsey, the publisher, hopes to improve the paper's fortunes by unveiling a version for Apple's iPad and a paid subscription model in the fall. He is expanding into commercial printing, including the programs it prints for the Buffalo Sabres hockey team, and hopes for double-digit growth this year. Mr. Lipsey said that in the coming years employees may have to contribute to their health insurance. But he is confident Mr. Buffett will support them.
''This will be one of the last papers that folds because Warren has pride in it,'' said Mr. Lipsey, an athletic, slender man in his 80s who, Mr. Buffett jokes, refuses to tell the investor his exact age.
Mr. Lipsey is close enough to Mr. Buffett to know his affinity for papers. They were introduced more than 40 years ago by Mr. Buffett's first wife, Susie, who shared with Mr. Lipsey a love of jazz. Mr. Buffett bought out Mr. Lipsey's Omaha weeklies, called the Sun newspapers, but kept him on as president and publisher.
With Mr. Buffett's help, the weeklies won the Pulitzer Prize for their investigation into Boys Town, the charity for homeless boys, in 1973. Mr. Buffett and Mr. Lipsey still share a sense of humor and folksy manner. (Mr. Lipsey's iPhone ring tone is a clown's horn.)
In 1977 Mr. Buffett learned that the Butler family, the longtime owners, wanted to sell The News to The Washington Post, where Mr. Buffett was a board member. When The Post turned down the Butlers, Mr. Buffett said he was interested and asked Mr. Lipsey to work on the paper's finances.
It was not an auspicious start. According to a corporate history, the paper lost $10 million by 1980, and Mr. Buffett's desire to start a Sunday issue set off a costly court battle with the rival Buffalo Courier-Express, which folded in 1982. ''That was a very tough period,'' Mr. Buffett said. He added that Mr. Lipsey and his team ''persevered in a tough fight and a tough legal situation.''
In those years, Mr. Buffett was more deeply involved in the paper. He encouraged Mr. Coppola, then a reporter, to write an article about how chief executives were using corporate jets to fly to a California retreat and treating it as a business expense.
Edward Cuddihy, a former managing editor, said Mr. Buffett offered guidance on negotiating with unions.
In 1989, Mr. Buffett met with the incoming editorial page editor, Barbara Ireland, for a two-hour brunch to talk about politics before she was offered the job. Reporters recall how he attended the company picnic and autographed their dollar bills.
But Mr. Buffett's involvement has shrunk as Berkshire Hathaway has grown. Margaret Sullivan, who was appointed managing editor in 1998, said that Mr. Buffett had offered guidance when asked and offered praise for the paper's awards. But he was not involved in editorial decisions. She said she had the financial resources to hire staff when necessary and to approve investigative projects, like a series last year on prescription drugs. But she does not have an endless bank account to spend on prizewinning journalism.
''We don't have all of the resources behind us. We do really strong work, not to win awards, but to benefit the community. I think we're very ambitious in our reporting.''
Still, the paper attracted Charlie Specht, a 24-year-old staff reporter who turned down a job in Washington at The Daily Caller to work in Buffalo. In Buffalo, he could afford to buy a $105,000 house, get married, start a family and get better reporting experience.
''I would never have gotten to cover the types of stories that I have been able to cover,'' Mr. Specht said. ''It's comforting to know your paper is owned by Warren Buffett. I hope he lives to be 200.''

HEADLINE: Mergers of European Mobile Carriers Expected to Grow

BYLINE: By KEVIN O'BRIEN

 BODY:
BERLIN -- European mobile telephone operators are primed to enter a long-awaited phase of consolidation.
As growth slows, and as the need to cut costs and pay out millions for new, faster networks grows, longtime rivals are joining forces in markets across Europe to reap the benefits of economies of scale.
''You are going to see this happen more and more,'' said John Delaney, an analyst in London at the International Data Corporation. ''Fundamentally, there are too many network operators. Revenues are declining in the core services of voice and text, and the rise in data revenue is not making up for the shortfall.'' 
European policy makers are supportive. Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner for telecommunications, said that consolidation would help the Continent's industry maintain its competitive position with rivals in the United States and Asia, where greater consolidation has allowed for faster adoption of new technologies.
''Having a few pan-European operators that are strong in the cross-border market would not necessarily be bad for competition,'' Ms. Kroes said.
The advantages of merging among carriers go beyond bigger customer bases and revenues and superior coverage of wireless network grids. Operators also stand to save millions building the next generation of wireless data networks based on Long Term Evolution, or LTE, technology.
In Britain, O2 U.K., a unit of Telefonica of Spain, and Vodafone said this month that they would place their network grids, but not their businesses, into a joint venture to save operating costs and reduce the expense of building an LTE network.
The move comes partly as a response to the merger in 2010 of Orange and T-Mobile, the British mobile units of France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom, which created Everything Everywhere, now the largest mobile operator in Britain.
Others may soon join the trend. In Germany, the No. 3 and No. 4 mobile operators -- O2 Germany, a unit of Telefonica, and E-Plus, owned by KPN of the Netherlands -- are investigating merger or sale options for their carriers, which for years have failed to make significant inroads against their larger rivals, T-Mobile and Vodafone.
Whether such combinations have the desired effect is still unknown.
Everything Everywhere was created in Europe's most competitive mobile market, with five network operators. Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom's mobile units had both been overtaken by O2 U.K., which surged to the top of the British market by selling custom calling and data plans with generous texting and messaging allowances, and by getting exclusive rights to sell the iPhone in Britain from 2007 to 2009.
When the alliance was announced in September 2009, executives from the two companies highlighted the $:3.5 billion, or $5.4 billion, in efficiencies expected by 2014.
Neal Milsom, the chief financial officer of Everything Everywhere, said the merger was on track to meet its cost-saving goals. The two operators have merged warehouses and suppliers and have reduced the amount of office space in the London headquarters by 38 percent. Everything Everywhere cut 1,800 jobs, or 11 percent of its work force, in 2011 and is on track to cut its operating expenses by $:278 million this year. This spring, the company began to trim some of its 18,000 third-generation network cell sites in Britain.
The company is investing $:1.5 million a day in its network, a commitment of about $:1.5 billion over the next three years, he said.
''Since our inception, Everything Everywhere has succeeded in a highly competitive environment,'' Mr. Milsom said.
While Everything Everywhere retains the largest share of the British market, with 33.7 percent as of the end of 2011, its share has declined from about 37 percent when the merger was announced, according to International Data Corporation. It has also struggled financially, losing $:188 million through the end of 2011.
Part of the reason, according to some analysts, has been the challenge of defining its brand. At the time of the merger, Everything Everywhere was the name chosen by the venture partners as the overarching corporate brand, but T-Mobile and Orange have continued to sell their services to consumers under their old brands. In late 2011, the company started opening Everything Everywhere stores that sell both Orange and T-Mobile services.
''That is one area where Everything Everywhere remains confused,'' said Pete Cunningham, an analyst at Canalys in Reading, England. ''They operate under the T-Mobile brand, the Orange brand and Everything Everywhere. It is a bit odd, as if they cannot agree on a strategy.''
There has been some internal turbulence as well. Last September, Olaf Swantee, the France Telecom head for Europe who was named Everything Everywhere's chief executive in July, shrank the layer of top executives from 26 to 10; the company said six executives had left voluntarily, including the former managing director of T-Mobile U.K., Richard Moat, who had been Everything Everywhere's deputy chief executive.
Through the transition, the company has been steadily improving its profitability, even as it loses market share, by focusing on higher-value smartphone contract customers. Revenue from data and messaging plans rose 17 percent in the first quarter of 2012, to 45 percent of the total average monthly revenue from each Everything Everywhere customer, up from 37.5 percent a year earlier.
But significant challenges remain. Everything Everywhere is battling O2 U.K. and Vodafone over whether it can repurpose part of the broadcast spectrum it owns for a fourth-generation LTE network. British regulators will decide whether that would place Everything Everywhere's rivals at a disadvantage.
The regulator, Ofcom, said it was disposed to look favorably on Everything Everywhere's request, but it has so far not granted the company permission to rededicate the spectrum.
For the time being, Deutsche Telekom and France Telecom say they are pleased with the progress of their venture.
''Everything Everywhere has established itself as a market leader in the British market and is successful in a rapidly changing telecommunications industry and within the current difficult economic climate,'' said Claudia Nemat, the Deutsche Telekom board member for Europe and technology.

HEADLINE: Campaigns Turning Focus to Borders

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
If you're focused on the presidential campaign, get ready for the politics of immigration.
President Obama set the stage on Friday by announcing that he would unilaterally stop enforcing deportations against many illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children. But immigration was already set to be the topic of the week on the campaign trail.
Here's why: 
OBAMA IN MEXICO: Mr. Obama left on Sunday for Los Cabos, Mexico, for the G-20 summit meeting of the world's major economies.
Topics other than immigration are likely to dominate the two-day meeting: the economic crisis in Europe, a meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, and the political and military crises in Egypt and Syria.
But the location of Mr. Obama's trip provides the backdrop for a discussion of immigration between Mexico and the United States. And by announcing his new deportation policy just days before arriving, Mr. Obama all but ensured that it will come up in discussions with other leaders and with reporters.
What he says in Mexico will immediately echo on the campaign trail, where Mitt Romney has already criticized Mr. Obama's new policy. But on Sunday, Mr. Romney dodged the question of whether he would repeal it if he got into the White House next year.
''What the president did - he should have worked on this years ago,'' Mr. Romney said on ''Face the Nation'' on CBS. ''If he felt seriously about this, he should have taken action when he had a Democrat House and Senate, but he didn't. He saves these sort of things until four and a half months before the general election.''
THE COURT: Any day now, the Supreme Court is expected to announce its decision on the constitutionality of an Arizona law that expanded the powers of police officers in the state to enforce immigration laws.
The decision could have far-reaching implications for illegal immigrants. A ruling upholding the law could be seen as a green light for other states to follow suit. If the court strikes the law down, it may help immigration activists who say Arizona went too far.
On the campaign trail, either decision could supercharge the issue. Mr. Romney must contend with conservative supporters who do not want him to embrace amnesty or comprehensive immigration reform. Mr. Obama faces Hispanic voters already suspicious of his commitment to the issue.
For months, both candidates have largely sidestepped the issue (though they have each released ads in Spanish). A Supreme Court decision will be hard to ignore.
DUELING SPEECHES: But perhaps the most direct engagement on the issue of immigration is likely to come at the end of the week, when Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are both scheduled to deliver remarks to the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials annual conference in Orlando, Fla.
Mr. Romney is scheduled to go first, addressing the group on Thursday. It will be an opportunity him to expand - or not - on his response to Mr. Obama's new immigration policy.
It will be a tricky moment for Mr. Romney, who appears to be trailing Mr. Obama badly among Hispanic voters. Several top aides have said he must find ways to narrow that gap. But doing so too aggressively could undermine his support among conservatives.
For Mr. Obama, who is to speak on Friday, the appearance is likely to be less contentious because of his new policy on deportations.
Some Latino supporters have expressed frustration with the president for not pushing harder to achieve a comprehensive immigration overhaul that would provide a pathway to citizenship for many of the illegal immigrants already in the country.
That may still be an undercurrent on Friday. But many Hispanic activists have cheered his new policy, making it more likely that he will be received warmly at the event.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: North Korea Calls Clinton Criticism 'Reckless'

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea on Sunday accused Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton of being ''reckless'' for advising its new leader to give priority to improving the lives of his people instead of spending money on weapons. 
North Korea can now ''steadily boost its nuclear deterrent by itself without letting its people fasten their belts any longer,'' the North's official Korean Central News Agency quoted a North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying.
The United States and South Korea often claim that North Korea is impoverishing its people by diverting its scant resources into building nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.
On Thursday, Mrs. Clinton urged the new leader, Kim Jong-un, to chart a course different from that of his father, Kim Jong-il, whose sudden death in December left his relatively inexperienced third son at the helm. The son, still believed to be in his late 20s, has vowed to continue his father's ''military first'' policy.
''This young man, should he make a choice that would help bring North Korea into the 21st century, could go down in history as a transformative leader,'' Mrs. Clinton told reporters after a meeting with the South Korean foreign and defense ministers in Washington. ''Or he can continue the model of the past and eventually North Korea will change, because at some point people cannot live under such oppressive conditions -- starving to death, being put into gulags and having their basic human rights denied.''
North Korea always bristles at any outside criticism of its leadership and often counters with sharp language. It has labeled various American and South Korean leaders ''human scum,'' ''war maniacs'' and ''running dogs.'' It once called Mrs. Clinton a ''minister in a skirt.''
In recent months, North Korea has focused on the South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, calling him a ''rat,'' an epithet often used by Mr. Lee's most vocal domestic critics. It has also threatened to attack South Korean television stations and newspapers that have published reports critical of the North's new leadership.
Mr. Lee has also raised the ire of the North by withholding large shipments of aid until it gives up its nuclear weapons program. Political analysts say they suspect that the North is increasing its anti-South Korea propaganda to help consolidate support for its new leader.
On Sunday, the North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said the country built nuclear weapons to protect its dignity and would continue to bolster its nuclear weapons program ''as long as the U.S. persistently antagonizes it.''
The United States should mind its own business, since ''99 percent of its population is exploited by those who account for just 1 percent,'' he said. ''Hillary would be well advised to pay more attention to the issues of economic crisis and huge hordes of jobless people, which have become so serious that they may dash the hope of the administration of the Democratic Party'' to stay in power.
Tensions on the Korean Peninsula remain high after a rocket launched by the North in April failed to put a satellite into orbit. Washington condemned it as a test of long-range missile technology.

HEADLINE: Cooperation Replaces a Lone Wolf Approach to Photography

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: Changes in the business of photojournalism over the past five years have produced an explosion of collectives, fostering cooperation within and among groups. 

 BODY:
After shooting their assignments for The Naples Daily News, Lexey Swall, Greg Kahn and Tristan Spinski would unwind together at night, playing dice and talking about photography. Mr. Spinski, 33, says rolling dice is "a nice conduit to conversation."
It's also a pretty fine metaphor.
The three photographers recently left the comfort of their stable staff newspaper jobs, which they enjoyed, to start a collective, "Grain."
"The only chance to be the photographer that you want to be is to be bold and to do it yourself," Mr. Spinski said. "This is what we live and breathe. If we wanted the nice cars and fancy clothes we wouldn't have chosen this line of work to begin with. We wanted photography to be the thing that drives us, and it is the thing that drives us."
Radical change in the photography industry during the past five years has ignited an explosion of photo collectives. Each collective is unique and reflects the circumstances, desires and philosophy of its members. The paradigm of photographers operating as lone wolves has shifted somewhat to one of cooperation - both within and between collectives.
These trends were on display at the Look3 photo festival in Charlottesville, Va., last month, where the Grain collective announced its formation. There were more than a half-dozen other collectives represented at the festival, demonstrating that the collapse of some of the old methods of making a living have led to the creation of new sources of artistic and financial support.
Alex Webb of Magnum, Stanley Greene of Noor and Lynsey Addario of VII had solo shows and were featured speakers. Razon had a group exhibit, Prime rented a house and entertained scores of young photographers, and members of the Cause Collective erected the Truth Booth, a giant modern-day video confessional.
Luceo'sexhibit was truly a group effort. The images, from a joint road trip project, "Few and Far Between," were not credited to individual photographers.
The exhibit itself came into being only after a scavenger hunt in which more than 100 participants, mostly young photographers, gathered a series of clues at exhibits, lectures and local businesses. The clues led them to fragments of the Luceo photographs. When the scavengers brought them to the exhibit space and put each piece on the wall, the four-foot-by-six-foot images became complete and ready for viewing.
"Instead of just showing work, we wanted to show these ideas of community and collaboration," said David Walter Banks, a member of Luceo. "We had to have the community involved in order to get the photos on the wall, and we wanted to make sure our audience was getting the full experience of the festival."
Community and cooperation - among individual photographers and among collectives - were themes that came up repeatedly at Look3.
Members of Luceo have helped others who are starting out on the same path they did five years ago. They shared what they had learned with the photographers of Prime when they launched a year and a half ago.
"I think this industry is struggling enough," said Melanie Burford, a member of Prime. "Luceo has been quite generous. We have to support each other either as individual photographers, within a collective or between collectives."
There are a variety of models for collectives, which include different degrees of cooperation. The members of Luceo have a very tight business relationship as well as close personal and artistic ties.
"As much as we we all share the same passion, we all share the desire to turn that passion into something that will sustain us for the rest of our lives. I don't want to throw in the towel because I was only running around making art and not making a business," Mr. Banks said.
The Luceo members have successfully blended together both financially and photographically, and have been masterful at promotion through social media.
Razon has a more casual approach, focusing on its ability to help one another artistically. "We didn't want to create an agency; we wanted to have a creative spark but keep it pretty simple," said Jared Moossy, a founding member.
"We use each other to support each other," he said. "Relying on five other photographers to make decisions is sometimes like herding cats, but I think there are times when you need someone to help you with an edit or help you get access or help you financially."
So far, Prime is following a middle road. Members help promote one another, yet keep their individual businesses. They are concentrating on creating group projects and helping one another tell better stories.
In 2007, Mr. Greene helped found Noor, a cooperatively owned photo agency that focuses on producing issue-oriented visual reports to stimulate social change. Because the photographers are often working on different continents, they meet primarily through Skype. Mr. Greene, 63, yearns for more of "that touchy-feely thing where we look at each others' pictures and have dialogues."
"We all need to find a way to be more human with each other and be more in tune with each others' needs and wants," he said. "If these young collectives are going to work they have to find a way of communicating with each other that is much more hands on - much more about being in community with each other."
The grandparent of photographer-owned agencies is Magnum, which was started in 1947 by Robert Capa, Henri Cartier-Bresson and others. It now has 53 living full members, as well as nominees, associates and the estates of 15 deceased members.
Mr. Webb joined Magnum in 1974 and recalls there being about 24 members then. During his talk at Look3, he questioned whether there was still a need for large agencies of any kind. He also fondly recalled his early years at Magnum, when he would spend more time discussing photography with other younger members.
In a phone interview on Sunday, Mr. Webb said that all agencies - privately owned or cooperative - need to find new models, rather than relying entirely on magazine assignments. He pointed to Magnum's "Postcards From America" project as a positive step.
'It's complicated because Magnum's strength is in its diversity, but its very diversity makes it difficult to move forward cohesively, because different photographers need different things," he said.
Other photo cooperatives and collectives in the United States are much smaller than Magnum. The VII agency has 23 members; Luceo and Prime each have six. Ms. Burford, of Prime, points out that "six voices are better than one."
Hank Willis Thomas was the only photographer to speak twice in Charlottesville. He presented his own work on Friday and spoke about the Cause Collective with his fellow members Ryan Alexiev and Jim Ricks the next day. Mr. Thomas said the collective gave him the opportunity to think broader and create things that he could not do alone.
"Sometimes the artist working alone gets too much credit for work," he said. "People are often more into the narrative of the artist than the work itself. When you work collaboratively, no single person can get all the credit and it becomes more about the practice and the idea and getting the audience to engage."
There used to be four business models in photojournalism: newspapers, wire services, photo agencies and the lone wolf. Agencies and newspapers are now in difficult circumstances. Despite the challenging economic landscape, hundreds of young people join the ranks of photojournalism every year. Most will have to develop several streams of income to survive.
Mike Davis, a freelance picture editor who has worked with Luceo, Prime and Grain, says that forming collectives is "a logical response" to the situation young photographers face. Otherwise, they end up with little economic, editorial or artistic support.
Members of Luceo have committed themselves to helping younger photographers and have an annual student project award that was judged and announced at Look3. The winner, Alena Zhandarova of Russia, received $1,000 and the mentorship of the Luceo photographer of her choice.
The openings for both Razon's and Luceo's exhibits were scheduled, by accident, for the same time on Friday night.
Luceo's scavenger hunt had created a great deal of buzz about the exhibit. To make sure people could easily attend both openings, which were a half-mile apart, the members of Luceo hired a party van to shuttle between the events. 
It was an appropriate gesture for a festival that highlighted collectives - and cooperation.

What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: Working Harder for Less
The net worth of Americans has fallen back to 1990s levels. But Americans are also spending less on groceries than in 1982. A lot of small-business owners are working without pay. Others are working a lot more hours per week and taking less vacation time than they did five years ago. Small-business optimism remains flat. Retail sales fall again. Meanwhile, America's standing in the world has continued to deteriorate. Perhaps bacon sundaes are the problem?
The Economy: Ice Cold
One graph sums up the history of economic pessimism, and these 11 charts show that the economy has gone "ice cold." A credit bureau keeps America's rating unchanged, but the outlook is "negative." Mike Shedlock tells the fairy tale of three economic wizards. Tim Duy, who watches the Federal Reserve, says that more easing seems "likely," but he's not sure of the form. April machine-tool orders fell 17 percent, but manufacturing profits are still 34 percent above 2007 levels and business inventories "look good." Port cargo in Los Angeles was flat in May, but experts predict a busier summer. Another hopeful sign: small manufacturers are buying big machines. But factory output contracted in May for the second time in three months. Here's someone who thinks the United States economy is on the threshold of a new golden age.

Here are 65 new regulations that were published last week, according to the Competitive Enterprise Institute. Here's what to expect when collecting sales tax. John Arensmeyer says that small-business owners actually support Environmental Protection Agency regulations that promote clean and renewable energy, and J. Kelly Conklin says that cutting regulations is not the top priority for small businesses. But Jacob Goldstein wants regulations to be reduced: "Once upon a time, these barriers weren't such a big deal. In 1950, fewer than 5 percent of Americans worked in jobs that required licenses. Today, it's roughly 30 percent, and that number is likely to grow." Two members of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship have introduced a bill that would require the Small Business Administration to help small companies export their goods and services. Three large health insurance providers plan to retain some benefits created by the health care overhaul even if the Supreme Court strikes it down.

The Week's Bests
Sonia Simone shares five marketing secrets of the master sommeliers, including: "It's not your job to tell people what they want. Our instructor told us about a wine bar whose staff have been instructed to say to a customer asking for an after-work glass of Chardonnay, 'I don't think that's what you're looking for today.' You don't have to serve the desires of every customer - and the truth is, you can't. You can educate, you can build a bridge between what they want and something they might like even better. But leave the condescension at home. It's bad manners and bad for business."
Steve Errey says you're an idiot (and you should accept it): "Being an idiot makes it possible to embrace your work and your life without knowing how it will play out. That means you don't have to pretend to know. You don't have to hide that you don't have the answers."

Victory Spurs Speculation on Bharara's Next Move | With the conviction of Rajat K. Gupta, the United States attorney in Manhattan, Preet Bharara, has now secured the biggest scalp yet in the government's broad campaign against insider trading on Wall Street.
A victory in a case that relied almost entirely on circumstantial evidence is sure to embolden prosecutors in their pursuit of hedge fund traders and their tippers.
But after nearly five years of investigations and 60 convictions of hedge fund traders and corporate executives, a question looms for Mr. Bharara and his team of federal prosecutors: Is it time to move on?
Several top prosecutors have done just that. Christopher L. Garcia, who helped lead the government's widespread crackdown of insider trading, left in February. Jonathan R. Streeter, the lead prosecutor in the case against Mr. Rajaratnam, left earlier this year, as did Andrew Michaelson, who was crucial in bringing and prosecuting the Galleon case.
And the Gupta trial is expected to be the last for the prosecutor Reed Brodsky, who also prosecuted Mr. Rajaratnam.

HEADLINE: Do Magnet Schools Still Matter?

BYLINE: LIZ ROBBINS


HIGHLIGHT: Do you think magnet schools still matter? How important is integration as a goal for New York City's schools? 

 BODY:
As detailed in Sunday's Metropolitan cover story, "Integrating a School, One Child at a Time," four elementary schools in Brooklyn's District 14 won a federal magnet grant in 2010 for approximately $1.5 million over three years to desegregate. 
 Magnet schools are the Rubik's Cubes of school reform, relics of the 1980s that these days are overshadowed by charter schools as a tool of school improvement.
Magnet schools are designed around a theme like arts or sciences intended to draw students from outside their attendance zone to create a more diverse population. The plan is to end the isolation that minority groups - generally blacks and Hispanics - experience when they are the overwhelming majority in a school.
Although it is still early in the process, the results have been mixed among the District 14 schools, which sit on the edge of one of the fastest gentrifying sections of the city. What does this say about the role of magnet schools in New York and in the country? Several scholars offered their thoughts about the challenges magnet schools face and their relevance today.

 "There's a wide body of research to suggest that confronting economic and racial segregation is one of the most important things to improve outcomes for students," said Richard D. Kahlenberg, a senior fellow at the Century Foundation, which provides analysis of integration issues. Mr. Kahlenberg added that education was "very driven by fads," and that charter schools "are the hot new thing."
 "If the theory of magnet schools is that you have to address segregation, the basic theory of charter schools today is that if you can get around teachers' unions, then positive things will happen," Mr. Kahlenberg said. "To me, that proposition is much weaker. There are two big movements for school choice; both recognize that kids stuck in bad schools deserve better options. Segregation is the problem."
Amy Stuart Wells, a professor at Teachers College at Columbia University, said that while charter schools typically rely on a model based on student performance, magnet schools are built on a theme. Ideally that creates excitement, she said, for both teachers and students that shows "we're not just here to raise test scores."
Josh Thomases, the deputy chief academic officer for New York City public schools, said the Education Department did value magnet schools. The department hires grant writers every three years to apply for the federal program. 
"They've been an important investment in communities where we want to attract resources and create great schools," Mr. Thomases said. "The realities of a changing neighborhood population have meant that we have seen different outcomes in the desegregation."
Gary Orfield, director of the Civil Rights Projectat the University of California, Los Angeles, said that just providing great schools - and giving parents choice - was not enough. 
 "All of the studies of school choice show there is a tremendous inequality of choices," Professor Orfield said. "Unless people have networks and information, they really don't know what's there."
Do you think magnet schools still matter? How important is integration as a goal for New York City's schools?

HEADLINE: Trust in Government, Declining With Cuts

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Declining confidence in institutions and cutting funds for those institutions can be a self-perpetuating cycle. 

 BODY:
Tyler Cowen's Economic View column on Sunday argued that the government's economic tool kit was less effective because Americans lacked trust in the government:
Various policies that are being put on the table, including forms of fiscal and monetary stimulus, try to accelerate [the process of rebuilding American wealth]. They would all be likely to underperform, partly because the public, rightly or wrongly, doesn't see them as ways to rebuild confidence. We have become skeptical of our own macroeconomic authorities and abilities, and that, in turn, makes successful policy harder to pull off.
The column also suggests that trying to preserve or even increase government jobs or government spending could cause public trust to erode further. But I wonder if the opposite is true.
Declining confidence in institutions and cutting funds for those institutions can be a self-perpetuating cycle.
People lose faith in their government institutions, perhaps because those institutions are poorly run or because pundits declare that the institutions are poorly run (usually, some combination of the two, it seems). Voters and/or their politicians then sharply cut funds for those institutions. Insufficient funds and staffing then make these institutions even less effective, reducing confidence in them further and thereby prompting even more cuts. And so on.
The Postal Service is in a similar, and perhaps instructive, position. Already the agency has become something of a symbol of government incompetence and inefficiency.
The agency is supposed to be self-sustaining, but its costs have outweighed its revenue for several years now. The Postal Service's most obvious challenge has been the proliferation of e-mail, which greatly reduced demand for mail services but not the expensive infrastructure required to maintain a nationwide postal system. It also has significant pension and retiree health care liabilities.
But perhaps equally damaging is the fact that agency funds are hamstrung by Congress.
In this case, the funds aren't coming directly from taxpayers, but from consumers and business customers. Congress has not allowed the Postal Service to make some of the decisions that would help it collect more revenue from customers, such as providing more diversified services, like insurance or banking, as its Japanese counterpart does; or raising prices, since postage rates cannot go up faster than the overall Consumer Price Index. (The Postal Service also has not received permission from Congress to cut costs, such as by eliminating Saturday mail delivery.)
Because it is still waiting for Congressional approval to make many of these changes, the Postal Service is cutting costs by reducing staff levels and hours at existing facilities. Reducing costs in the way that's most politically expedient rather than most efficient and economically sensible means that service will most likely get worse, customers will lose confidence in the agency, market share will fall further and the agency will be forced to make more drastic and possibly inefficient cuts.
You get the idea.
Confidence and trust in the government has been falling since well before the financial crisis, and today the public seems especially amenable to drastic government spending cuts. If draconian cuts are made suddenly, they will often be made where cutting can be done most quickly, not necessarily where the cuts will promote more efficiency.
That likely means a continuing decline in the quality of government services, further fraying Americans' trust in the ability of their public institutions to set good policy.

HEADLINE: French Elect New Yorker to National Assembly

BYLINE: EMILY BRENNAN


HIGHLIGHT: For the first time, French foreign nationals living in the United States and Canada have elected a deputy to represent them in France's National Assembly: Corinne Narassiguin, a 13-year resident of New York City. 

 BODY:
Updated, 10:40 p.m., June 22 | WHEN France's National Assembly reconvenes on Tuesday, its new Socialist majority will include a longtime New Yorker.
This year, for the first time, French citizens living abroad will be directly represented in the country's legislature. And on June 16, French foreign nationals in the United States and Canada elected Corinne Narassiguin, a 13-year resident of New York City, to the lower house of Parliament.
Ms. Narassiguin, 37, is a member of PresidentFranois Hollande's Socialist Party and a newcomer to politics. She defeated Frdric Lefebvre, 48, a former junior minister in the economic ministry under PresidentNicolas Sarkozy, who was the candidate of the conservative Union for a Popular Movement party.
The campaigns in New York City, an important battlefield in the election, were the subject of a feature in the Metropolitan sectionthis month.
Ms. Narassiguin won the election handily, with 54 percent of the overall vote. New Yorkers did not rally behind their hometown candidate, though; the conservative Mr. Lefebvre won 53 percent of the votes among those registered with the consulate in New York City.
Ms. Narassiguin learned of her victory on June 17 atMurphy & Gonzalez, an Irish-Mexican restaurant in Greenwich Village, where she watched the election returns with 50 campaign volunteers.
At 5 p.m., a team member in France relayed the news in a conference call as supporters in Boston, Montreal, Ottawa and elsewhere listened in.
A few minutes later, French news programs announced the results on two of the restaurant's three wide-screen televisions. (The third was showing the Portugal-Holland Euro 2012 soccer game.) Applause and shouting filled the restaurant.
With no time for a bon voyage party, Ms. Narassiguin left for Paris on Tuesday night to settle into her new office. In addition to getting her badge and filling out paperwork, like any new employee, she has met with party members from the other constituencies abroad to discuss how to reform the system of subsidies for schooling. This week, she plans to sort through a pile of impressive rsums to hire a staff.
Ms. Narassiguin, who is originally from Runion, a French island in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar, said she was caught off guard by the French news media's interest in her ethnicity. She is of mixed race, mostly Indian on her father's side and Chinese on her mother's. The subject did not come up much during her campaign across North America, and when it did, it was only as one part of her identity as a young woman working in the private sector - a rare combination in French politics.
"My professional background was maybe more important to North American voters than the fact that I was a minority," she said by phone from Paris on Friday. "Here, that's really what people are talking about."
Though she will make trips to her North American constituents every month, her new position in France is a full-time job.
"I'm excited about everything that is happening," she said on Monday, "but that's the saddest part, leaving my daily life as a New Yorker."
But Ms. Narassiguin said she planned to keep a pied--terre in the city.

HEADLINE: One Wall Street Seer Says the Greek Tragedy Is Near

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSS SORKIN


HIGHLIGHT: Mark Grant doesn't call his assumptions Doomsday, but reality: Greece will most likely fall apart in the next four months unless "there is debt forgiveness or Europe keeps handing them money like they are a ward of the state." 

 BODY:
If you want to be scared, truly terrified, listen to Mark J. Grant. He might be right.
For the last two years, Mr. Grant, a managing director based in Florida at a regional investment bank, has been predicting the bankruptcy of Greece and a cascade of chaos across the global economy, attracting quite a following on Wall Street in the process.
"Greece will be forced to return to the drachma and devalue, and the default will cause bank runs and money flowing into Germany and the United States as the only viable safe haven bets," he declared the day before Sunday's Greek elections, irrespective of which party would win. "Greece will default because there is no other choice regardless of anyone's politics."
He then walked through the falling dominoes: "It will hit the (European Central Bank), the banks on the other side of the derivatives contracts, all of the Greek banks who are really in default at present and being carried by Europe as well as the nation, and the Greek default will spread the infection in many places that we cannot imagine because so much is hidden and tucked away in the European financial system."
Welcome to Doomsday, brought to you by Mr. Grant. He says he doesn't think of it as such; he calls it "reality." He told me on Monday, almost hopelessly, "There's only so much money to go around."
In a Jan. 13, 2010, report, Mr. Grant forecast that Greece would default on its government debts, one of the first to publish such a prognostication.
Mr. Grant could be the Nouriel Roubini (Dr. Doom) of the European crisis. Mr. Roubini, the New York University economist, said the subprime-debt sky was falling for a long time before it fell. Few people listened, in part, because nobody had ever heard of him. Then, of course, the sky fell. Now everybody has heard of him. Time will tell, but soon everybody could know Mr. Grant.
The January 2010 report, written two years before Greece did indeed default, has made him the go-to forecaster of Europe's collapse for some of the world's largest investors. Nicknamed the Wizard, Mr. Grant, who works for Southwest Securities, sends out a daily report, often frightening in its detail and matter-of-factness, by e-mail to a who's who of the world's biggest institutions, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds. Subscribers like Bill Gross, a founder of Pimco, the world's largest bond fund, pay thousands of dollars a year to receive Mr. Grant's views in their in-boxes.
Never one to sugarcoat his views, his success is partly a function of his plain-spoken way of making complex ideas simple.
"There is only one way out of this mess and that is if Europe keeps handing Greece money like one does to some aged aunt that cannot support herself, but that is a family decision," he wrote. But, he argues, "Greece requires 16 other family members to support her jointly and the politics in many of these nations, including Germany, is making it difficult for the charade to continue."
His view of European officials' effort to "fire-wall" the problem countries is equally simple: "This whole subject is a ruse in my opinion. Think of horses in a corral. The rancher keeps trying to build a higher and higher fence around his horses but for what purpose? For the rancher it is to keep the wolves out."
Mr. Grant, who loves to mix metaphors, takes his rancher metaphor further: "The real problem is that the horses are sick, infected and that the disease of fiscal mismanagement has spread to virtually every horse in the corral except one and do not expect that one, Germany, to remain disease-free much longer."
Layering on another metaphor, he adds: "You can call cancer a cold if you like but it changes nothing; not one thing."
Sadly, Mr. Grant is not predicting the default of just Greece, he's already on to Spain (he reached that conclusion before many others, too).
"The country cannot afford to pay off their regional debt, their bank debt," he wrote on Monday, "and various schemes to avoid the Men in Black from taking over will not work nor will the pleas for 'more Europe' as the words mouthed by Germany are meant for placation only and will not find implementation in any kind of timeline that will make any difference."
He has convinced himself that Germany, the only country in a position to help, will not come to the rescue. "You can bank on one thing if nothing else; the Germans will not allow their cost of funding to rise or their standard of living to decline to help the nations that have gotten themselves in trouble. You can count on this!" he wrote.
As we were talking on Monday, he said he wanted to make clear that he did not believe Armageddon was upon us. And it's not as if Mr. Grant is wishing this to happen, despite his boat in Fort Lauderdale, named "Wishes Granted."
"I don't think the world is going to hell," he said. "It's very negative. What's going on is serious. It will have a whole slew of negative consequences." But he insisted, "I don't think it's going to get to the 1930s."
More likely, he said, we are headed for a bad recession with lots "of shocks to the system." He says this will likely happen in the next four months unless "there is debt forgiveness or Europe keeps handing them money like they are a ward of the state."
"Or," he warned, "it could come sooner."

HEADLINE: The American Dream: Phase II

BYLINE: ALLISON ARIEFF


HIGHLIGHT: As Americans think about where to live, there's an increasing emphasis on neighborhood and community instead of square footage. 

 BODY:
That's L. Brooks Patterson's irresistible description of sprawl, proving yet again how masterful the stalwarts of the status quo are at messaging that which they hope to preserve in amber.
In a spectacular Web post, Patterson, the county executive of Oakland County, Mich., continued to wax poetic on the topic: "I love sprawl. I need it. I promote it. Oakland County can't get enough of it. Are you getting the picture? Sprawl is not evil. In fact, it is good [it] is new jobs, new hope and the fulfillment of lifelong dreams."
Patterson's rousing stump speech for sprawl is emblematic of how we as a culture are far too invested in a vision of the American dream that doesn't make sense in the 21st century. Over the past 30 years we've stripped away the supporting mechanisms of sprawl but have continued to create it. 
We've built more houses than we've needed - and built them farther away from jobs. This has led to longer commutes, which has created more traffic. In response, we built more highways, increasing fuel consumption and, as transportation planners acknowledge, doing little if anything to reduce traffic. It's a vicious, seemingly endless cycle, and at its core is the notion that the American dream can exist only within the framework of the single-family home on a large lot.

Indeed, we've become so fixated on this as the sole delivery mechanism of that American dream that we've spent a disproportionate amount of our collective energies (home-) improving it without considering meaningful alternative visions - or devoting at least a smidgen of attention to what's outside the front door or down the block. Everything in our culture today reinforces this idea of home as castle (or fortress) rather than home as part of a larger whole (i.e., neighborhood). We need to find our way to the latter view, and part of that means finding a better way to talk about it.
The good news is that more and more people are.
It's true that for years, homebuilders and home-sellers were touting Patterson's sprawl-friendly sales pitch. If you were to walk into the sales center of any subdivision or master-planned community, from Modesto, Calif., to Tampa, Fla., the first question you'd be asked was, "How much square footage are you looking for?" Not "What kind of community would you like to be a part of?" 
But increasingly, many of those looking for places to live found that the market had nothing for them. Houses were too big, too isolated, too generic, too hard to maintain. Or they were designed for the quintessential nuclear family that exists more in our cultural imagination than in reality. Few homes offered options for aging in place, for returning college kids or elderly parents, or even decent home office space. Would-be residents lamented the lack of amenities like a caf or a playground within walking distance in master-planned communities of 5,000, 10,000 or even 40,000 homes (!), an absence often explained away with "a community of this size couldn't support it." For years, I heard from builders and developers who said they knew there was a market for smaller, more sustainable properties - they just couldn't get such projects to pencil out. 
Now, it seems those pencils have been sharpened.
"The giants of the building industry, the creators for decades of massive communities of cookie-cutter homes, cul-de-sacs and McMansions in far-flung suburbs" are doing an about-face, suddenly building smaller neighborhoods in and close to cities, noted an article in USA Today last month. 
The market slowdown, the article went on to explain, "has given builders time to assess sweeping demographic changes that are transforming the way Americans want to live."
In short, builders are recognizing that buyers (and renters, too!) value the neighborhood as much as - if not more than - the house. And what they want from that neighborhood might not be McMansions and four-car garages after all. Resale value may not in fact trump all else. Young and old, whether they're in the city or the suburbs, want to walk to places like restaurants and shops. (And let's stop talking about the integration of things like cafes, public transit and bike racks as "urbanizing" an area, which only reinforces the divide between two entities that are divided enough already.)
People have begun to wake up to the fact that the more time spent in the car means poorer health and less time with their families - and they're seeking shorter commutes. They're interested in smaller homes that are easier to maintain (and less expensive to heat and cool). Young millennials and older baby boomers are also showing less and less interest in car ownership and a corresponding greater interest in public transit, walking and biking. And again, it's likely that we're all less interested in continuing to discuss "urban" and "suburban" as dueling polar opposites - and more interested in recognizing there's mutual benefit to some overlap. 
The aforementioned changes point to the fact that a paradigmatic shift in our concept of the American dream is underway. And this shift is not just because of the recession, says Gregory Vilkin, managing principal and president of MacFarlane Partners, quoted in that USA Today piece, "It's no longer the American dream to own a plot of land with a house on it and two cars in the driveway."
The country could be moving toward something much better, something that's less about consumption (of stuff, of such essential resources) and more about quality of life. Neighborhood groups have perhaps never been so strong a force, joining together to create an array of community-building offerings that make shared space the place to be (rather than the place to enter the garage from). Groups like Western Massachusetts Alliance to Develop Power have been building a "community economy" to address problems of jobs, housing and energy; the ever-expanding Build a Better Block shows that citizens care about their neighborhoods enough to begin to improve them on their own. It seems every day there are hybrid fix-it shops/cafes (instead of tossing that coffee maker, have a neighbor repair it and join her for a cup when it's working again), sharing programs that encourage collaboration over competition (everything from tools to office space, babysitting services to garden plots) - even cargo-bike sharing (the latter to facilitate car-free, short-distance errands like food shopping), and an infinite number of smartphone apps to facilitate everything from easier use of public transit (Routesy or NextBus are great examples) or the effortless swapping of kids' clothes. 
For years now, people have been looking for an alternative, and the market - and the culture - is responding. A recent piece in Next American City demonstrates that even parts of notoriously sprawled-out states like Florida, Georgia and South Carolina are recognizing that investments in downtown cores will pay far more dividends than investments in their peripheries. 
Government can play an important role here, too: Since 2009, the Obama administration's Partnership for Sustainable Communities has supported this shift, promoting more transportation choices, equitable and affordable housing, and efforts to make government work better. 
And yet there are still those who are having none of it. And they are a vocal and often breathtakingly well-funded minority. For them, the sprawl that characterized the years leading up to the financial crisis remains a dream to strive for. Any threat to the McMansion of yore is equated to "feudal socialism" (I kid you not). And these opponents not only excel at mobilizing the troops but at mastering the message. Take a look at the rhetoric of, say, the Texas Republican party, which recently passed "Resist 21" in opposition to Agenda 21, the United Nations' sustainable communities strategy adopted in 1992. Taken together, proclaims Resist 21, those strategies aspire to "the comprehensive control of all our population and its reduction to sustainable levels and the socialization of all activities by their relocation to highly restricted urban settlement centers." 
Living better and smarter shouldn't be a partisan issue, nor should attempts at facilitating it be equated with destroying "our fundamental rights and liberties as a people." (Come on, Texas!) It is true that advocates for livable communities err in presenting their case with soulless terms like "smart growth" and "transit-oriented development" and, yes, "Agenda 21," which is far from anyone's idea of "home." Those in favor of keeping things as they are, foreclosures and foreign oil be damned, go too far in demonizing good intent. 
As Jeremy Madsen, the executive director of the Greenbelt Alliance explained to me recently, "Everyone from environmentalists to the Tea Party deserves a voice. Even if over the next 30 years the majority of new communities consist of town homes and apartments near transit there will still be plenty of single-family homes available for those who want them."
The only difference? People who want another option will have a greater opportunity to live their own version of the American dream.

HEADLINE: Southern Baptist Convergence

BYLINE: MOLLY WORTHEN


HIGHLIGHT: If conservative evangelicals are serious about making common political cause with black Protestants, they must rethink their approach to America's history and its modern-day problems. 

 BODY:
The secular media usually ignores the thousands of pastors, missionaries and church volunteers who gather every summer for the annual meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention. This year is different. Everyone from PBS to the Huffington Post is buzzing with anticipation - and not because they are awaiting the tedious discussion of committee reports and budgets necessary to manage the country's largest evangelical denomination. The reason for all the excitement is this: the 2012 convention, which opens Tuesday in New Orleans, will elect a black man as president for the first time in Southern Baptist history. This is no small thing for a denomination that separated in 1845 from its northern brethren in order to defend the right of Southern slaveholders to serve as missionaries.
Fred Luter, the presumptive nominee and pastor of New Orleans' own Franklin Avenue Baptist Church, said that his imminent election marks "a new day in the Southern Baptist Convention." The current president, fellow New Orleans pastor David Crosby, called the vote "a great, hopeful, powerful message to our city, our culture, our convention and our country." No one claims that the election will usher in a colorblind Christian utopia. "We have a long, long way to go in America as far as racial reconciliation," Luter told PBS, and just last month, Richard Land, one of the S.B.C.'s most prominent leaders, earned a formal church reprimand for calling racism a "myth."
Yet there is a more fundamental question that lurks behind this historic moment. Is a "black evangelical" a contradiction in terms?
In recent years, conservative white Protestants have made a special effort to reach out to black believers who share their views on theology and social mores - all the more so as Republicans gear up to woo the "black vote" in November. After all, pollsters have found that black Protestants often agree with white evangelicals on the importance of religious faith and the sinfulness of homosexual behavior. They are no great supporters of abortion rights. They ought to be natural allies in the fight to "defend the family" and preserve America from the forces of secular humanism.
Yet to many African-American Protestants, "evangelical" and "the Christian Right" remain white words, and their voting record proves it. Even if we discount the special attraction that Barack Obama held for African-American voters and look back to the 2004 presidential election, we see that 83 percent of black Protestants who attended church weekly voted Democratic, and 92 percent of those who were less observant went for Kerry. Karl Rove's strategy to mobilize the evangelical vote did not work on them.
The reasons for their alienation, rooted in history, are still with us today. Black Protestants may affirm Christ's divinity, the Bible's literal authority, and the other basic doctrines that white conservatives preach. But a statement of creed is not the same thing as lived religion. In many black churches, the crucible of slavery, Jim Crow and the civil rights movement has forged these doctrines into a theology quite different from the cocktail of personal moralism, prophecy and Christian libertarianism that has come to preoccupy the Christian right. If conservative evangelicals are serious about making common political cause with black Protestants, they must revise their expectation that a free market and and a population that obeys their particular reading of scripture will correct the injustices ingrained in American society. They must rethink their approach to America's history and its modern-day problems.
Black Protestants have good cause to eye Republicans warily and mistrust the label "evangelical": the Christian right's concerns do not match their own experience or priorities. Tony Evans, pastor of the Dallas megachurch Oak Cliff Bible Fellowship, is as a good candidate as any to represent "black evangelicalism": he was the first African-American to earn a doctorate from the Dallas Theological Seminary, a bastion of fundamentalism. There he found that he "was getting evangelical training, but on the other hand, I was in this social reality, and I didn't see them coming together," he told me when I visited his church a couple of years ago.
At a seminary best known for teaching biblical inerrancy and prophecies of Armageddon, Evans wrote his doctoral thesis on James Cone, the dean of black liberation theology, a school of thought that critiques unjust social and economic conditions through the lens of the gospel. Today Evans spends more time working to keep troubled kids and teenagers in school and drug-free through his ministry, The Urban Alternative, than he does picking fights over classic evangelical obsessions like the theory of evolution. Evans is no liberal - he favors faith-based activism over government intervention and recently criticized President Obama for abandoning the Defense of Marriage Act - but as Evans explains it, "as a black evangelical, I live in two worlds. That's a tension for me."
Conservative black Protestants and the Christian Right also have different memories of American history. While David Barton and other amateur evangelical historians have baptized the founding fathers as orthodox architects of a new Zion, African-Americans remember them as the authors of the Three-Fifths Compromise. "For far too long Anglo Christians have wrapped the Christian faith in the American flag, often creating a civil religion that is foreign to the way God intended His church to function," Evans writes in his book, "Oneness Embraced." For black Christians, American history is not a narrative of decline from an arcadia of Sunday family devotionals and McGuffey Readers to the godless fleshpots of modern America. It is a narrative of liberation that is not yet complete.
These divergent understandings of history have amplified disagreement over what it means to follow Jesus' and the prophets' command to "set at liberty those who are oppressed." There is a clich that white evangelicals are too busy straining toward heaven to care about social justice here and now. This is unfair. Even the most Apocalypse-obsessed preachers have had a heart for the underprivileged: Dwight Moody - a 19th-century evangelist and the spiritual grandfather of the "Left Behind" novels chronicling the end times - founded a school for orphans, the children of slaves and other needy students. William Jennings Bryan, the creationist anti-hero of the Scopes trial, was a progressive politician who opposed the laissez-faire policies of his day.
In the years since World War II, conservative evangelicals' commitment to "compassion ministry" has mushroomed. The country's marquee megachurches earmark large portions of their budgets and volunteer manpower for services to their local communities and relief work abroad. Evangelical charities like World Vision International, Samaritan's Purse and Compassion International contribute millions to disaster relief, child welfare and economic development all over the world. Habitat for Humanity was partly the brainchild of a Southern Baptist who founded an interracial communal farm in Georgia (although some neighbors - probably God-fearing evangelicals too - were not so fond of the idea). What is all this, if not proof that the supposed foot soldiers of the Christian right are working to liberate the poor and oppressed?
It all depends on what you mean by liberation. The conservative media guru Glenn Beck once warned his followers: "I beg you, look for the words 'social justice' or 'economic justice' on your church Web site. If you find it, run as fast as you can. Social justice and economic justice, they are code words." Beck's main target was that politically inconvenient liberation theologian, Jeremiah Wright, but he was on to something. In the early decades of the last century, white Protestants who embraced modern science and the latest biblical criticism also began to stress humanitarian work over evangelism. In the 1950s and 1960s, they applauded Washington's role in expanding the welfare safety net and legislating against discrimination - while many of their conservative brethren lamented the government hubris that removed prayer and scripture from classrooms, upended traditional social hierarchies and "liberated" American public life from the authority of Christianity. To conservatives, such liberation was in fact a kind of bondage: "social justice" became code for "liberals who abandon the Bible and embrace atheistic Big Brother." 
Few evangelicals deny that the Bible has social implications, but "the apostles launched no social reform movement," writes R. Albert Mohler, the president of Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, the S.B.C.'s flagship seminary. "Instead, they preached the Gospel of Christ and planted Gospel churches. Our task is to follow Christ's command and the example of the apostles," he added. Despite the efforts of some evangelicals to combine conservative theology with progressive politics - or at least contest the notion that Jesus opposed the minimum wage - those evangelicals with the most political clout have helped turn the party of Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt into a pseudo-religion with its own Holy Trinity: the flag, the traditional family and the free market.
It is always risky to generalize about the so-called Black Church, a wildly diverse faith community whose representatives range from the civil rights hero Andrew Young to the prosperity-preaching televangelist Creflo Dollar. Yet it is fair to say that for most black Protestants - conservative and liberal - "social justice" remains one of Christ's core commands. Preaching the gospel includes challenging an unjust social order that first condoned slavery and still traps African-Americans in a web of inequality and prejudice. While conservative white evangelicals have tended to focus their compassion ministry on caring for individuals, black Christians are more likely to locate the sources of injustice in social structures as well as in the hearts of sinners.
Corporate sins - institutionalized racism and economic inequalities enshrined in tax codes, the justice system and the distribution of social services - demand repentance. Federal law and government institutions have perpetuated great wrongs in the past, and some black Christians, like Evans, believe that the church is the best agent of social transformation. But many others will never forget that the civil rights movement owed as much to Supreme Court decisions and federal legislation as it did to grassroots cultural change. This legacy encourages them to see "big government" as a crucial ally in reform, and to question the Christian Right's vision of Washington as a socialist hydra that strangles freedom. "It's not enough to talk about what black folks ought to do," said Cameron Madison Alexander, pastor of Antioch Baptist Church North in Atlanta (where former presidential candidate Herman Cain is a member). "We have to also look at what government is not doing to ensure fairness and equal opportunity. God is on the side of the least of these."
Eleven o'clock on Sunday morning is not quite "the most segregated hour" that it was in the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s time, and white evangelical churches deserve praise for their growing proportion of nonwhite members (the Southern Baptists now claim 20 percent, up from just 5 percent in 1990). At the same time, genuine diversity means more than a polychromatic group photo at the church picnic. It is a matter of ideas as well as color. White evangelicalism would not be the vibrant religious culture it is today if white Christians in the Old South had not borrowed freely from the music and worship style of slaves. Their modern descendants should renew that receptive spirit and take seriously the task of reading the Bible and considering American history through nonwhite eyes. As the scholar C. Eric Lincoln once wrote, "black theology is in some sense what is missing from white theology."

HEADLINE: Get the Speculators

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: How will the new French government protect the euro zone from speculation? 

 BODY:
The Greeks got all the attention, but the more important election Sunday may have been in France, where the Socialists and their allies won a clear majority in Parliament. 
One difference is that the victors in France will be able to govern. We still don't know exactly who will be in a new Greek government, assuming they are able to form one, but we know the policies it will pursue. They have been set in Brussels and Berlin.
Steven Erlangerreported from Paris:
The prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, thanked voters and said the government would work to fix public finances and reduce unemployment. "The goal is to shift Europe toward growth and protect the euro zone from speculation," he said. "The task before us is immense." 
The part that caught my eye was the goal to "protect the euro zone from speculation." Does he think that all would be fine if it were not for those darn speculators dumping Italian and Spanish bonds? 
It will be interesting to see how he and the new president, Franois Hollande, seek to accomplish the goal. Presumably he is sympathetic to European efforts to regulate rating agencies, impose a "Tobin tax" on financial transactions and ban "naked" purchasing of credit default swaps (that refers to buying protection when you don't own a bond or have other exposure to the credit).
For the record, so far France is in the group of countries that seems to be benefiting from investor anxiety. Its borrowing costs are down over the past six weeks.
Here are the yields on 10-year government bonds in six countries on Monday, and their changes since May 4, just before Mr. Hollande was elected president. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.)
Germany, 1.40 percent, down 18 basis points.
United States, 1.57 percent, down 31 basis points
Britain, 1.63 percent, down 33 basis points.
France, 2.61 percent, down 22 basis points.
Italy, 5.90 percent, up 71 basis points.
Spain, 7.18 percent, up 144 basis points.

HEADLINE: Putting Obama's Jobs Proposal in Context

BYLINE: JONATHAN WEISMAN


HIGHLIGHT: When voters struggling through their creaking commutes question how Congress could build an infrastructure during the Great Depression but not in the long aftermath of the Great Recession, they should look at the growth of government that began during the New Deal. 

 BODY:
With federal borrowing costs virtually at zero, President Obama has been pressing Congress for months to pass a major infrastructure program aimed at putting Americans to work and rebuilding the country's creaking roads, bridges, rails and tunnels.
 His model: the New Deal, when a nation reeling from far worse economic conditions built some of the wonders of the engineering world, like the Golden Gate Bridge, the Grand Coulee and Hoover Dams, the Triborough Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel.
 But as Congress struggles just to pass a stay-the-course highway and transit bill, the White House and Capitol Hill are facing a complication that Franklin Delano Roosevelt could not have imagined - the scope of government on which a jobs program would be layered.
 Consider this: the Golden Gate and Triborough Bridges, the Grand Coulee and Hoover Dams, La Guardia Airport and the Lincoln Tunnel cost, in total, about $7.4 billion in today's dollars. In 1934, federal spending was more than double federal tax receipts, $6.5 billion versus $3 billion. Spending of that scope today would double the expected $1 trillion deficit of the current fiscal year.
 Yet even in the worst deficit year of the Depression, the deficit totaled 5.9 percent of gross domestic product. It is now at 8.7 percent of G.D.P.
 At its peak, Depression spending in 1934 and 1936 topped 10.5 percent of G.D.P. Federal spending dipped to 9.8 percent of G.D.P. in 1940, before Social Security,Medicare and the development of a superpower's military heading into World War II began the inexorable growth of government. Spending has never been below 10 percent since.
This year, it will top 24 percent.
 So when voters struggling through their creaking commutes question how Congress could have done it in the Great Depression but not in the long aftermath of the Great Recession, they should not look at the government built during and after the financial crisis of 2008. The issue is the government that preceded it.

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley Declares Victory

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: If a war goes badly, declare victory and get out. That seems to be the Morgan Stanley strategy for the Facebook I.P.O. debacle. 

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley, with Facebook egg all over its face, has adopted the strategy memorably advocated by Senator George Aiken in 1966: Declare victory, and get out.
Senator Aiken'sproposal concerned the Vietnam war. It was not followed by President Lyndon Johnson. The war escalated for several years, until the United States finally withdrew while claiming it was not losing.
Monday's Wall Street Journalreports that Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter for Facebook, "says it did its job for its clients, and that the fact that the stock traded above the $38 offering price on the first day meant that the deal was priced well."
"The price and size of the transaction were consistent with the institutional order book of demand as indicated to the lead underwriters, and confirmed by the trading of the stock prior to the impact of the Nasdaq trading issues," said a spokeswoman.
Nasdaq did completely mess up the first day's trading, but that does not explain why Facebook shares fell after the first day and since have not gotten anywhere close to the $38 price. 
The Journal adds, "In an internal webcast 11 days after the offering, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive James Gorman told employees that Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg had called him after the offering and praised Morgan Stanley's work on the deal, say people who heard the webcast."
I can understand why Facebook executives might like Morgan Stanley's performance. Let's say, for argument's sake, that $30 would have been a more reasonable price, at least in terms of leaving the initial investors feeling as if they had not been ripped off. That $8 a share would have reduced the company's take by about $1.4 billion and cost the selling shareholders -- a group that does not include Ms. Sandberg -- about $1.9 billion. Nearly a billion of that would have come directly from the chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg.
The rather obvious reality is that Morgan Stanley badly misjudged the demand for the stock. A problem with any initial public stock offering that is expected to be hot is that buyers oversubscribe. If you want a million shares, ask for three million and then have that cut by two-thirds by the underwriters. When some of those customers got way more Facebook shares than they expected, they reached the conclusion the offering was in trouble, and dumped both the shares they had not really wanted and the ones they had thought they wanted.
But instead of admitting defeat, Morgan Stanley proudly says it performed well. If only the United States had done that in 1966.

HEADLINE: The Media and Obama's Immigration Gambit

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Is the press exaggerating the political brilliance of the White House's new immigration policy? 

 BODY:
A month ago, I wrote a Campaign Stops column laying out the political risks associated with a presidential "evolution" on gay marriage. That same afternoon, President Obama formally endorsed same-sex marriage. Last week, I wrote a Campaign Stops piece explaining why the politics of immigration aren't as favorable to various forms of legalization as many elites in both parties tend to assume. Three days later, President Obama unilaterally ordered a kind of provisional legalization (an end to deportation, and with it the possibility of work permits) for under-30 illegal immigrants who were brought to America as children.
You may be detecting a pattern here. Clearly the White House has a slightly different reading of the politics of various hot-button issues than yours truly, and clearly they think what I've dubbed "the social issues strategy" carries more benefits than costs. And they're being confirmed in this perspective by much of the press coverage of their various culture-war forays: In both center-left and mainstream outlets, there has been consistent admiration for the administration's maneuverings on these issues, and a consistent implication that the political risks are marginal-to-nonexistent.
This passage from Matt Taylor's Slate dispatch on the decision's political consequences distills that conventional wisdom to its essence:
The dexterity with which Obama and his team have been able to repeatedly put Republican nominee Mitt Romney in a box, forcing him to awkwardly cater to his party's rigid, out of the mainstream views on gay rights and immigration rules, is helping to ease fears on the part of some Democrats that the economy would drag their man down in November.
The headline of the piece is "Obama's immigration move already paying dividends," and even though the author doesn't actually cite any such evidence (unless you count quotes from two Democratic consultants and the "co-founder of the polling firm Latino Decisions") there is a new poll out that shows the president's gambit boosting Hispanic enthusiasm. But Hispanics aren't the entirety of the electorate, and Taylor's piece only references the possibility that some voters might be less than thrilled with the decision in order to dismiss it. "The president's immigration shift," he writes, "confirms he has no intention of getting drawn into a fight over the working class white voters of campaign lore, but instead changing the composition of the electorate like he did four years ago."
Now it's true that Obama's easy 2008 win was built in part on youth and minority turnout, and that the president cruised to victory even though he didn't perform particularly well among working class whites. But Hispanics were still only about 10 percent of the electorate four years ago, whereas whites without college degrees were almost 40 percent. This meant that even though Obama won about 67 percent of Hispanics and only 40 percent of white working class voters, he still won millions more working class white votes in total - and needs to win at least some of those millions again. Given that anxieties about immigration's impact on native employment tend to be concentrated among working class voters (and particularly among working class voters, who happen to be in direct competition for jobs with the beneficiaries of this policy change), it seems at least possible that the White House's gambit will hurt in states like Ohio and Wisconsin as much as it helps the campaign in states like Nevada and Florida.
One reason that this possibility has found its way into so little of the press coverage, I suspect, is that the media has persistent difficulty recognizing that there are swing voters who lean rightward on the social issues (broadly defined to include immigration as well as abortion, gay marriage, etc.) as well as swing voters who fit the Acela Corridor's "socially liberal, economically moderate" paradigm of what a good centrist should be. Thus the "secure the borders first" position on immigration is defined as incorrigibly right-wing and potential general election poison by reporters, even though a plurality of independents prioritize border security over a path to citizenship and a substantial minority of Democrats do as well. (Likewise on abortion, of course, where the press has difficulty even acknowledging that pro-life women exist.) Whether the White House really knows what they're doing politically, then - both with this policy shift and with the social issues strategy, generally - depends on how thoroughly they've dug into the underlying numbers and gamed out their state-by-state implications, versus how much they've allowed themselves to be swaddled in a comfortable media cocoon.

HEADLINE: Loopholes Abound Despite New Rules

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: Regulators are trying to clamp down on rogue traders like JPMorgan Chase's Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale, who amassed large positions in credit derivatives as part of a complex trading strategy that eventually soured. 

 BODY:
Bank regulators are casting new nets to catch excessive risk-taking in the financial system. But future London Whales may find plenty of ways to slip right through them.
The story of JPMorgan Chase's multibillion-dollar trading loss is now well known. Traders, including Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale, amassed large positions in credit derivatives as part of a complex trading strategy that eventually soured.
The motivations for the trades were unclear. While the bank says they were intended to offset other risks on the books, the strategy also appeared to have a speculative element.
Nearly four years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers incited a worldwide financial crisis, such blowups are all too probable.
Banks in the United States are still operating in a sort of regulatory no-man's land. Many of the new post-crisis rules have not yet become effective. And even when they do, the loopholes remain large.
The Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank legislation that will be phased in over the next two years, is intended to catch certain types of trading. But it may not snag the wagers of JPMorgan's Whale.
While this regulation prevents banks from doing speculative trades with their own money, it will not stop hedging activities, which JPMorgan has said were at the root of the trading losses. The Volcker Rule contains guidelines that are meant to help regulators decide whether a hedge masks a proprietary bet. But even with these prescriptions, speculative trading could still slip through.
In JPMorgan's case, the bank wanted to hedge the large amount of loans and bonds on its balance sheet. To do that, its hedging strategy initially centered on buying bearish derivatives that would rise in value as the creditworthiness of large companies deteriorated. Then, in January, JPMorgan started putting on a huge bullish credit position, to help temper the bearish bet - essentially, a hedge on a hedge.
To help distinguish between hedges and speculation, the rule asks the banks to be able to show that the hedges have a relationship with the assets being hedged. However, it requires only that they be "reasonably correlated." The rule says that hedges are allowed if they are "made in connection with, and related to, individual or aggregated positions." JPMorgan could point to that and argue that the Whale's trades were related to the bank's corporate loans and bonds.
Other parts of Dodd-Frank try to temper risk in more subtle ways. The regulatory overhaul tries to move many derivatives onto central clearinghouses, entities that handle the underlying payments on a trade. This is supposed to strengthen the derivatives markets, because the clearinghouses will force participants to back their trades with margin payments made in cash or very safe securities. In theory, the financial burden of supplying margin to clearinghouses could make Whale-type trades prohibitively expensive, and therefore less attractive for banks.
But the main type of derivative in the Whale's loss-making trade - a credit index called the CDX.NA.IG.9 - is already centrally cleared in large amounts, according to figures from ICE Clear, a clearinghouse that handles that index. If JPMorgan's positions are executed through a clearinghouse, it would mean that the added costs of clearing did not prove a deterrent, and might not stop similar traders in the future.
However, one part of this net may work. Some derivatives analysts think JPMorgan may be exposed to "tranches" of the CDX.NA.IG.9 index. Tranches slice up credit indexes in such a way that participants can choose to take on more or less credit risk. Tranches of the CDX.NA.IG.9 are not executed through a clearinghouse.
That is a crucial issue, because regulators are planning to demand much higher margin payments on derivatives that are not centrally cleared. If regulators do set this margin above clearinghouse levels, such trades may become too expensive for banks.
But some analysts think the extra margin may not be a sufficient deterrent. "If it is a trade you really believe in, you may still go ahead and do it, even if it is more expensive," said Olu Sonola, an analyst at Fitch Ratings.
Another effective measure may stem from the new international banking regulations set by the Basel committee. On paper, they will force banks to hold a lot more capital against certain trading positions, even ones using centrally-cleared derivatives.
The new Basel rules' impact on JPMorgan's credit bets could prove substantial, which the bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, indicated last week in his Congressional testimony. In the fourth quarter of last year, he said, the latest Basel rules stood to increase the "risk-weighted" value of the credit derivatives portfolio that contains the Whale's trades to $60 billion, from $20 billion.
Under Basel, a bank sets capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Consequently, a tripling of the position's risk-weighted size would lead to a tripling of capital held against it. Notably, proposed Basel trading rules could force banks to hold more capital if regulators see evidence that hedges may not perform effectively in stressed situations, said Jerome McCluskey, a lawyer at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy.
But again it seems there may be an out. In his testimony, Mr. Dimon implied that JPMorgan thought the large bullish bets would actually make its credit derivatives portfolio less onerous under new Basel rules. It's possible that JPMorgan misread the Basel rules, or miscalculated the risks of the trade when setting its risk-weighted value. Even if both are true, it remains that the bank thought tens of billions of dollars in new trades - trades that ultimately blew up - would sail straight through Basel net.
All that means the Whale is far from extinct on Wall Street.

HEADLINE: Don't Look Down

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
Somewhere between Nik Wallenda's first step onto a tightrope over Niagara Falls and Greece's most recent retreat from the brink, it hit me: teetering needlessly on the precipice of disaster wasn't just the story of the weekend. It's the story of our days.
Cliff dwelling has become the modern way of life. 
We exist, without always having to, on the edge. Or, rather, on one edge after another, some of our own making, others avoidable if we could just summon the maturity, discipline and will.
As cliff dwellers we deal with nothing until the last possible minute and act in timid, impermanent ways, growing all too accustomed to indecision and a bit too inured to dread. Although we have alternatives -- paths, however strenuous, back to safer ground -- we neglect them, casting our lots with chance. Maybe a wave comes and takes us. Maybe not, and we can contrive some pleasure as we watch the sunset.
On Sunday our gazes were diverted, once again, toward Greece. Its citizens headed anew to the polls, to cast votes that held the possibility of doom for the euro, whose collapse would wreak economic havoc far and wide. The rest of us did what we'd become practiced at. We held our breaths.
But did it have to come to that? Greece's limbo underscores Europe's inability to determine once and for all how much it's willing to invest in the future of the euro. The Continent's leaders make micro adjustments in lieu of a macro commitment or big decision of any kind. The suspense sometimes shifts locus -- today Greece, tomorrow Spain or Italy -- but doesn't end.
That mirrors the serial uncertainty on the opposite side of the Atlantic, where the United States Congress, inept at so very much, excels at catastrophic scenarios and suffixes. It has mastered the -mageddon.
''Taxmageddon,'' as it's sometimes called on Capitol Hill, is the new biggie, looming early next year. That's when, in the absence of Congressional action, supposedly temporary tax cuts passed under George W. Bush and extended by President Obama expire as automatic spending reductions agreed to at the end of the debt ceiling showdown (''debtmaggedon'') begin to kick in. The combined force of those developments, according to some projections, would be a $700 billion blow to the economy in 2013 and, as the year progressed, a recession.
The current issue of Time magazine not only outlines this doomsday scenario and discusses how kick-the-can lawmakers have ''manufactured an irrational cataclysmic event,'' but also enshrines ''fiscal cliff'' as the phrase of the week.
The Times, for its part, presented ''fiscal cliffs notes,'' explaining that economic growth could slow by 3.6 percentage points next year if Democrats and Republicans can't reach an agreement that yanks us back from the brink.
They probably will. When they finally must. Which is months away. No reason to rush! Certainly not if the pace of progress in this case mimics the movement (or lack thereof) during debtmaggedon, when an intransigent band of the most conservative House Republicans delayed raising the debt ceiling for so long that the nation's credit rating was docked.
Everything is a standoff -- remember the December battle over the payroll tax? -- and all is brinkmanship, even budget votes that were once routine. Three times last year the government came close to a shutdown, and once the Federal Aviation Administration was forced to suspend some operations -- flightmageddon! -- while members of Congress bickered and $400 million in airline taxes was lost.
There are lesser -geddons as well, like ''loanmageddon,'' the July 1 point at which the rate for federally subsidized student loans will double to 6.8 percent from 3.4. Wrangling over this began months ago. Wrangling over this continues. Wrangling over this will almost surely produce some kind of extension, no doubt temporary, so that wrangling can resume next year. Even the littlest -geddons get their sequel.
And we get dangerously familiar with feelings of helplessness, with stopgap remedies and with last-minute reprieves, which are enough in some instances, not in others.
Right now Colorado is burning, and more than 55,000 acres and more than 180 homes have been decimated by what is being called the worst wildfire in the state's history. Six of the 10 largest wildfires in Texas' history happened last year, when the state suffered its worst drought since the 1950s.
Some scientists connect all of that and other extreme weather to climate change. Many of us feel culpable, and many of us fear worse. But, accomplished cliff dwellers that we are, we do more fretting than anything else. Confronted with the prospect of something as life-altering as global warming, we cool our heels.
And distract ourselves. ABC got its highest Friday-night ratings in almost five years when more than 13 million viewers tuned in to see if Wallenda could make it from one cliff to another: a man at the mercy of the winds, a metaphor for the taking.

HEADLINE: A Career Waiting For E.T. to Phone

BYLINE: By DENNIS OVERBYE

 BODY:
Jill Tarter once complained to me that she had no poetry in her soul.
It was 1990, and NASA was getting ready to undertake a survey of the 1,000 nearest stars, looking for radio signals from aliens. Dr. Tarter, then 46 and a researcher at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif., was in charge of it.
''I can't say what they will be like,'' she sighed, when asked to speculate about the nature and motives of these putative aliens. 
She was far too busy worrying about how to recognize a signal, not to mention how to avoid being fooled by the kid next door or a stray weather or spy satellite.
For some three decades, Dr. Tarter, now 68, has been the person most likely to be the first to know if we make contact with E.T. -- the one who will sound the alarm, spreading the news that We Are Not Alone.
Now Dr. Tarter is stepping away from the radio telescope, retiring from her post as the director of the Center for SETI Research at the SETI Institute in Mountain View. SETI, of course, refers to the search for intelligent life in the universe.
''The SETI Institute has a good pension plan -- we're grown-ups,'' she said by telephone recently.
There will be a dinner and speeches in her honor at SETIcon, a gathering of astronomers, astronauts and science-fiction fans in Santa Clara this weekend.
''I hope it's not a roast,'' she said.
Dr. Tarter never did get to deliver the news that we have company. But this, she contends, is not disappointing. What would be disappointing is if humans were not able to search for their neighbors at all.
Over the decades she has brooked few distractions from that quest.
When a reporter (O.K., it was me) once described Dr. Tarter's blond hair tied with a pink ribbon into a ponytail, she cut her hair short.
When the SETI researchers got a new radio telescope for their search -- the Allen Array, at the University of California's Hat Creek Observatory in Northern California -- she got a pilot's license so she could make the trip from her Berkeley home in one hour instead of six.
Jodie Foster's performance as an astronomer who does make contact, in the movie ''Contact,'' was largely based on time she spent with Dr. Tarter.
Three times, Dr. Tarter says, she has thought we had made contact, but hard-boiled caution prevailed. Once was in France in 1980, when she and her team had to wait for a suspicious source to pass over their telescope, and Dr. Tarter was afraid to go to sleep. ''I had to stay up for three days, afraid my French colleagues were going to call up Le Monde,'' she said.
Another time, while she was observing with a radio telescope in West Virginia, Dr. Tarter went so far as to alert colleagues in California of an auspicious signal -- and then forgot to call back when she discovered it was a satellite.
None of them was E.T. calling. Each one was another way to be fooled, another addition to Dr. Tarter's checklist, another necessary step along a path that may or may not have an ending.
It was in the 1970s while she was pursuing a Ph.D. in astronomy at the University of California, Berkeley, and raising a daughter that she first heard of SETI: the idea that lonely species could bridge the voids between stars with radio waves. She fell in love with it after reading a NASA report on the subject edited by Barney Oliver, the former head of research at Hewlett-Packard. Reassuringly, Dr. Oliver was a crusty gear head who had made himself and others rich, not the sort of man given to romantic fantasies. Hard-boiled, you might say.
Dr. Tarter said she considered herself lucky to have been born when the issue of life in the universe had become a scientific instead of a philosophical or religious one. ''For the very first time we had technology where we could do an experiment instead of asking priests and philosophers,'' she said.
''It might take multiple generations,'' she added, ''but there were no reasons not to start with the tools I have.''
The NASA survey that Dr. Tarter led began with great fanfare on Columbus Day of 1992, the 500th anniversary of the great explorer's arrival in the Americas -- a day that she called the high point of her life, a monument to human curiosity. ''I felt so proud,'' she recalled.
A year later it was over, canceled at the behest of a senator, Richard Bryan of Nevada, who was skittish about ''little green men.''
With help from Silicon Valley friends, Dr. Tarter and her colleagues at the institute took the search private and, over time, began to expand it farther out in space, to stars identified by the Kepler spacecraft as having planets.
Last year, however, the recession left the University of California with no money to operate Hat Creek Observatory, and the Allen Array had to be shut down, a moment that Dr. Tarter called the low point of her career.
''To have built that beautiful instrument and then have to turn it off, that hurt,'' she said.
The Allen Array is now back on the cosmic search job, thanks to a deal to share observing time on it with the Air Force. But to Dr. Tarter the whole affair was a wake-up call: SETI needs a permanent endowment. ''It's on my to-do list,'' she said last winter.
So she is not moving far, just down the hall, to concentrate on fund-raising. It's time, she said, to go calling on Silicon Valley 2.0.
The search, she explained, is ''too long and too difficult. If we want to attract the best and brightest, we want to be able to say, 'It's O.K., they can plan on raising a family.' ''
Once upon a time it was a crazy, romantic idea, perhaps nothing better than wishful thinking. It still is, but it makes us feel bigger and more grown-up just to try. And now it comes with grown-up benefits, like a retirement plan.
There might or might not be poetry in her soul, but Dr. Tarter's whole career has been a poem.

HEADLINE: At the Door or on the Roof, Women Are Still a Rarity In Building Service Jobs

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
Monique Catus stood at the entrance of an elegant Art Deco apartment building on East 51st Street one day this spring, with a smile on her face and pristine white gloves on her hands. A little girl trotted by, she later recounted, looked up at her, and then looked at her mother. She was confused.
''He's a girl!'' she said, turning to her mother. 
''No, she's a girl,'' her mother corrected.
''But!'' the little girl said, ''That's the doorman!''
Doorwoman, actually. Doorperson, or door attendant, would be fine, too. None of these terms, however, are widely in use, because even though there are thousands of people in New York City who do the job, only a few hundred of them are women. And the pace of change has been glacial.
According to 32BJ, the largest building employee union in the city, about 12,800 of its members in the five boroughs are employed as doormen, porters and the like in residential buildings. How many are women? Only 302. Of the nearly 3,000 residential superintendents in the union, the number of women is 45.
''We all say 'doormen' for a reason: you really don't see many women doing it,'' said Amy Peterson, the president of Nontraditional Employment for Women, a nonprofit organization that trains women for jobs in male-dominated fields like construction and building maintenance. ''But that's not because employers don't want to hire women, and it's not because women aren't ready.''
One reason, a spokeswoman for 32BJ suggested, is that the turnover in those jobs is quite low. Doorman, superintendent and porter positions are good union jobs (the minimum wage for a doorman in a typical apartment building is $20.77 an hour, before tips) with benefit plans and regular raises, and are not in danger of being shipped overseas. Often, such jobs are held by the same person for a few decades, or even passed down to the next generation.
''To get a doorman job, usually somebody has to die,'' Ms. Catus said, with only a hint of exaggeration.
But there are women who have muscled in, who are out there doing those jobs and doing them well, their employers say.
At the Beatrice, a high-end rental building on West 29th Street, two women are employed. One of them, Orla DiTaranto, 31, has been working as a doorwoman (as she calls herself) since the building opened in 2010. Ms. DiTaranto says that while her co-workers are very supportive, disparaging comments about her sex and her job from the people who pass through can be a daily occurrence.
''Just don't let anybody walk all over you, because they will if you let them,'' Ms. DiTaranto said. And if they give you trouble, she added with a chuckle, ''give them a little kick.''
When someone questions a doorwoman's ability to do her job, many say, the focus is usually on security.
Stephanie Vega, who works at the M at Beekman on East 50th Street, said that a man looking for an apartment for his daughter once asked Ms. Vega what kind of security background she had.
''Were you in the Army?'' he asked, Ms. Vega recounted. ''No, I wasn't in the Army, but that's why we have a telephone,'' she said. ''We call 911 when something happens.''
Mary Signorella, a general manager at Cooper Square Realty who oversees the Southgate cooperative where Ms. Catus has been working, pointed out that building security generally has more to do with keeping a pair of eyes on the door than with hand-to-hand combat.
''No one I know is going to say, 'Stop with your gun! You can't get past me!' '' Ms. Signorella said.
The Southgate, which is made up of four buildings on 52nd Street between First Avenue and the East River and an additional one on 51st Street, recently experienced a groundswell in the number of female employees, as six women were hired to fill in as porters or door staff members for the summer while regular workers are on vacation. All six were referred by Nontraditional Employment for Women, where a Southgate resident, Nicola Heryet, sits on the board.
The organization has been training women for jobs in male-dominated fields for more than 30 years, and construction jobs have long made up a large portion of its placements. But when the recession struck, construction projects dried up, Ms. Heryet explained, so the organization began to focus more on building services. This spring, it offered its first supplemental class in building operations to its graduates.
On a recent Thursday evening, eight women sat in the class (held in a brightly lighted basement shop room lined with power tools) learning all about HVAC systems and mold. The students included a former hairdresser looking for the stability of a union job and the superintendent at a supportive housing facility for people living with AIDS, who wanted to learn more about how to run her building.
Slowly, more women are being hired to do such jobs, and the sight of a woman in these particular roles will become more commonplace. But there are a few who have already been at it for decades.
Theresa Salfi started helping out at a building on Sullivan Street 50 years ago, when her father became the super there, and she officially took over for him when he died. Today, she and her brother, Joey Maietta, still work there together. But it is Ms. Salfi who is in charge.
''I'm the super,'' Ms. Salfi said. ''He's my handyman. He helps me.''

HEADLINE: No One Budges in Tense Iran Nuclear Talks in Moscow

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY; Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran, and Alan Cowell from London.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- A tense first day of talks between Iran and six world powers broke no new ground on Monday evening, offering little hope that the negotiations would defuse the standoff over Tehran's nuclear ambitions.
Iran has signaled it may be willing to stop enriching uranium to 20 percent purity, which is considered a technical step short of bomb-grade, but it seeks a weighty political message in return: an acknowledgment from the international community that it has the right to enrich uranium.
It is also hoping for a rollback of the tough sanctions by the European Union and the United States scheduled to take effect in the coming weeks, which will further isolate Tehran from world oil and banking markets. 
Iran received no such assurances on Monday from the six world powers, which consist of the United States, Russia, China, France and Britain -- the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council -- as well as Germany.
A spokesman for Catherine Ashton, who is the European Union's top foreign policy official and the lead negotiator with Iran for the so-called P5-plus-1 countries, described Monday's talks as ''intense and tough.''
In an afternoon session, Iranian negotiators picked apart a package of enticements that the six world powers first offered last month in Baghdad, which includes parts for old American civilian aircraft and fuel for an Iranian nuclear reactor, with the promise of more sanctions relief in return for specific Iranian actions to come into compliance over time.
''They responded to our package of proposals from Baghdad, but in doing so, brought up lots of questions and well-known positions, including past grievances,'' said Ms. Ashton's spokesman, Michael Mann. ''We are not there. We have to have further discussions tomorrow, based upon overnight reflections.''
Analysts said the six powers might be willing to relax one of the sanctions that is threatening Iran: a provision that bans insurers based in Europe from covering ships that carry Iranian oil anywhere in the world.
The measure would significantly reduce Iran's shipments to Asia, which make up most of the 2.2 million barrels it still exports daily. It met with resistance last month from Britain, a center of the marine insurance industry.
Cliff Kupchan, an Iran analyst at Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, said the ban could be carried out on schedule and then eased month by month if Iran were seen to be complying with the P5-plus-1's central demands: ceasing enrichment of uranium to 20 percent and exporting its stockpile of the material.
''I can't think of anything else that they could give, or that has been discussed among people involved,'' Mr. Kupchan said.
Mr. Mann, Ms. Ashton's spokesman, said the six powers were not offering to delay or waive sanctions until Iran had proved its willingness to comply with international agreements.
''Sanctions policy by definition is always under review, but can only be eased in response to real changes on the ground, so there is no question that our sanctions will come into force on the first of July,'' he said.
The Moscow talks appeared rocky starting early in the day, when an Iranian diplomat described the atmosphere as ''not positive'' and said the discussions might even conclude on Monday, a day earlier than expected. Diplomats on all sides were unusually tight-lipped as they went in and out of negotiating sessions, heightening the sense of tension.
But the Iranian assessment brightened somewhat by evening: Ali Baqeri, deputy chief of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said the discussion had been ''very serious and constructive'' when Iran had the opportunity to detail its complaints.
Much seemed to hang on a meeting on Monday night between the head of the Iranian delegation, Saeed Jalili, and Nikolai Patrushev, the secretary of Russia's National Security Council and a former head of the Federal Security Service.
A breakdown in the talks would increase the risk of a new war in the Middle East, after months of tension over whether Israel, which considers Iran a threat to its existence, will carry out a military strike against Iran's nuclear program. Iran is in violation of Security Council resolutions demanding that it suspend enrichment, and it has failed to ease concerns that its nuclear program is aimed at building a bomb, an accusation Iran denies.
''We all have to remember what we are doing here,'' said a Western official shortly before the talks began, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the talks. ''The international community's concern is to stop Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. That is what it is fundamentally about.''
Iranian news media portrayed the talks in Moscow in an unflattering light, with the Fars News Agency reporting that the proceedings demonstrated that Western powers were not interested in reaching a comprehensive solution. Without directly referring to the negotiations, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, released a speech castigating Iran's enemies, saying their ''misplaced arrogance and grandiosity will lead to nowhere.''
Iran is negotiating under duress because of the intensifying sanctions, which Ayatollah Khamenei has characterized as ''economic jihad.'' The value of Iran's currency, the rial, has dropped by 50 percent over the past 10 months, and inflation of food products exceeds 40 percent, said Mr. Kupchan, the analyst. The West, convinced that sanctions have induced Tehran to negotiate, is threatening to squeeze Iran's economy further.
Russian experts have played down chances for a breakthrough, saying domestic politics in Iran and the United States make it difficult for either to compromise.
''We must understand that for President Barack Obama, neither a final positive or negative solution is possible because he will face criticism for either one,'' said Vladimir Sazhin, a top Iran expert with the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences. ''With Iran, the situation coincides completely with the situation in the United States. Iran doesn't need one decision or the other.''

HEADLINE: An Ex-President Who Won't Keep Away

BYLINE: By HECTOR ABAD. 
Hector Abad is the author of the memoir ''Oblivion.'' This essay was translated by Anne McLean from the Spanish.

 BODY:
Medellin, Colombia
SOMEONE once said that former presidents are like old furniture. One thinks of a chest, revered for its noble appearance but no longer in use, eaten by termites, falling apart. Ever since modern medicine made longevity the rule and not the exception, countries have been accumulating these antiques. Four ex-presidents are living in the United States: the 39th, the 41st, the 42nd and the 43rd; it's very likely that the 44th will occupy some dusty corner until nearly the middle of the 21st century.
However, Colombia's former president, Alvaro Uribe, is refusing to play this part. 
For many years, Colombia's presidency followed the Mexican model: a monarchical ruler for a single term of office, with re-election prohibited by law, as a vaccine against strongmen who fell in love with power. This was a wise rule, given that Latin American leaders often prefer the Vatican's electoral system: a president who stays in office until he dies or, in rare cases, is too ill to serve. Fidel Castro is one such case, and after manipulating constitutional reforms to allow them to stand for re-election, Daniel Ortega in Nicaragua and Hugo Chavez in Venezuela (who is battling cancer) aspire to follow in his footsteps.
Colombia has moved in this direction. Thanks to his successful fight against the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and his having restored the country's faith in the future, Mr. Uribe was a very popular president. He was also very fond of power. For that reason he fostered a constitutional amendment that, in 2006, allowed him to stand for re-election and stay in office for eight years instead of four. In 2010 he pushed for a referendum that would let him run for a third term, but -- in an act of dignity rare in our region -- the proposal was declared unconstitutional by the country's highest court. Reluctantly, Mr. Uribe gave up power. The last thing he did was handpick his successor, Juan Manuel Santos, the former defense minister, who easily won the vote.
At that stage, Mr. Uribe should have retired to his cattle ranch, gone off to ride his horses and create a foundation for the defense of his political legacy. Instead, he decided to live, supposedly for reasons of security, in a police barracks in the capital, Bogota. There, he can get together with officers, among whom he has always been popular for his harsh stance against the guerrillas, and dash off criticisms of his successor.
Among Mr. Uribe's main causes of complaint are the so-called ''political prisoners'' -- Uribe supporters who have been imprisoned on corruption charges, or for participating in illegal recordings of Supreme Court judges, or for links with paramilitary groups, or for extrajudicial murders. Admirably, considering his connection with the former president, Mr. Santos has pursued these cases, and Mr. Uribe will not forgive him for it.
Mr. Uribe has never written much; he's not a person who enjoys developing an argument across the pages of an essay. However, he is addicted to Twitter (@AlvaroUribeVel has 1.3 million followers) and loves short phrases: slogans, more than thoughts. He spends his time, day and night, firing at (he himself uses this verb: ''disparar'') President Santos and his alleged acts of ''treason.'' Mr. Santos has sold his soul to terrorists and Hugo Chavez, the tweets say, and is driving the country into chaos. Colombia's hard-won peace, according to Mr. Uribe, will crumble under a resurgence of drug-financed guerrilla violence.
His fury has led some retired military officers to go so far as to talk of the need to stage a coup d'etat against the president. A coup isn't very likely, but another constitutional reform, allowing the messianic Mr. Uribe to run again in 2014, is possible; his supporters are already pushing for it. Failing this, what we can expect is the creation of a new party on the right, with a figurehead as a presidential candidate, and Mr. Uribe as the true leader. This means that in two years we won't be moving forward, but back: the election will be a plebiscite, yet again, in favor of Mr. Uribe or against him.
The ancient Greeks had a venerable institution to defend democracy against tyranny: ostracism. According to Plutarch, ostracism -- which consisted of expulsion from the city-state for 10 years -- was not punishment but a protective measure, a way of making the eminent humble again. It's a better answer to the problem of succession than some others.
There are many of us in Colombia who would like to see our vigorous ex-president giving self-improvement lectures abroad or consulting for some foreign corporation. Unfortunately, he'd rather be a nuisance in Colombia, tweeting and sowing trouble and rejoicing every time the FARC tries to assassinate a political figure or plants a bomb. Every military defeat for Mr. Santos is a triumph for Mr. Uribe: for him, the country has been heading for the abyss ever since it's been out of his hands. But never in recent decades have the economic figures (inflation, unemployment, growth) been so good. And if the security situation continues to be difficult, the homicide rates are no higher than they were under Mr. Uribe. In fact, they're still going down.
This is why many Colombians dream of something resembling ostracism and wish that piece of old furniture called Alvaro Uribe would stop getting in everybody's way in the middle of the living room.

HEADLINE: 2 Congressmen on Tough Turf Are Trying a Delicate Run Down the Middle

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
GRAYSLAKE, Ill. -- He had to know it would be unpleasant, interrupting eight unsmiling men of a certain age who were polishing off their morning coffee. But Representative Robert Dold, his face locked in a smile so bright it could be studied by astronomers, moved in.
''I'm rated by most organizations as the most independent member of the Congress,'' Mr. Dold, a Republican freshman, told the group of retirees, many of whom had announced themselves as Democrats, and union-affiliated to boot. One or two smiled politely. A few stared at their uneaten pancakes.
''Have you signed the Grover Norquist pledge?'' asked Dan Groth, 74, referring to a promise not to raise taxes under any circumstances. ''I did,'' Mr. Dold conceded, and he quickly went on to tick off the bipartisan budget measures he had also supported, as Mr. Groth shook his head.
''If you do get in, I'll be watching what you do,'' Mr. Groth said. ''Good luck to you.'' 
Mr. Dold will need it. With his Congressional district redrawn into the most Democratic one currently held by a Republican -- President Obama in 2008 won 63 percent of the votes in what is now the 10th District -- he is taking pains to point out that he is among the most moderate members of his reliably conservative party.
He sponsored recent legislation to protect Planned Parenthood from legislative assaults, voted for a failed budget plan that would have increased revenues and stood against his party on its House transportation bill.
He is one of a handful of Republican lawmakers who refer to the health care law by its given name -- the Affordable Care Act -- rather than by the pejorative name Obamacare, and he uses the word ''independent'' rather than ''Republican'' to describe his politics on the campaign trail. ''I believe what people are looking for is for us to work together,'' he says.
About 1,400 miles away, Mr. Dold's political doppelganger, Representative Jim Matheson of Utah, is running in the most Republican district held by a Democrat, and he is counting on his home state credentials to transcend party affiliation.
''I'm what people are looking for in Utah,'' Mr. Matheson said. ''They know I am six-generation, with deep roots in this state. Jim Matheson puts Utah first, and that's the politics I was raised on.''
In many ways, both men represent what Americans say they want more of -- compromisers willing to buck their party in the name of constituent interests and American salvation -- and as such are tempting failure.
Yet while Mr. Dold and Mr. Matheson are, mathematically, the most endangered incumbents in America, in neither case is that analysis quite true.
Mr. Matheson, whose father served as governor of Utah, is a well-liked politician who is long used to enticing Republicans to vote for him, as Republican officials -- who have played Wile E. Coyote to Mr. Matheson's Road Runner for six terms -- somewhat sulkily concede.
Mr. Dold, as Democrats understand with equal consternation, is a deep-pocketed rival whose relentless cheer and willingness to press his case aggressively with skeptics may help him persuade voters disenchanted with the dismal state of the Illinois economy.
But that does not mean their situations are not daunting, particularly in terms of the opponents the men drew this year. Mr. Dold is facing Brad Schneider, the very sort of suburban Jewish voter who has supported Republicans in the past; indeed, Mr. Schneider gave money to Senator Mark Steven Kirk, a Republican, when Mr. Kirk was in the House.
Mr. Matheson is being challenged by Mia Love, the mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, who, if successful, would be the first black female Republican to serve in the House.
Then there is the top of the ticket. ''Dold is running in Illinois with President Obama at the top of the ballot,'' said Nathan L. Gonzales, deputy editor of The Rothenberg Political Report. ''Matheson is running in Utah with Mitt Romney at the top of the ballot. Those will be very hostile situations for them.''
Mr. Schneider, interviewed at a deli in Northbrook, said he intended to make it clear that however bipartisan Mr. Dold had been, his voting record was still largely in step with his party's.
''Every single time that they've needed him, he's voted with them,'' he said, referring to Republican leaders in the House. He added, ''Bill after bill he has aligned with the Tea Party, and the Tea Party is not the agenda of the 10th District.''
Mr. Matheson has a similar tack, saying that Ms. Love is more in step with House Republicans than with independent-minded Utah voters. ''She wants to eliminate Social Security and get rid of Medicaid,'' he said. ''Those are positions that are just out there.''
She has her counterpunch ready. ''Jim Matheson says that he puts Utah first,'' Ms. Love said in an e-mail. ''But he voted against Utah and for Obamacare. He voted against Utah and for the stimulus. He has stopped voting for Utah's conservative principles and supports President Obama's policies 75 percent of the time in Congress.''
Then there is the money disparity. Mr. Dold has far more cash, because unlike Mr. Schneider, he did not have a divisive primary to contend with. As of March 31, Mr. Dold had raised $2,189,130; Mr. Schneider had raised $1,035,443.
While the Democrat may well catch up soon, Mr. Dold is using his money to spread his name around the new district. Last week, his team commandeered a bus, similar to the one used by Senator John McCain of Arizona in his presidential runs, to roll around his district.
He stopped at coffee shops, his bus blaring music in the parking lot, as a dozen young volunteers, goofy and excitable, tumbled out to hand out literature. Mr. Dold talked Medicare, deficits, women's health. Mr. Dold, who runs the family pest control business, will also talk bedbugs. (Solution: Place your luggage in hotel bathtubs.)
In Utah, Mr. Matheson has raised $1,205,262 to Ms. Love's $119,917. But she will certainly have help. The independent expenditure arm of the National Republican Congressional Committee has announced that it is spending nearly $1 million in the Salt Lake City market to aid her.
Mr. Matheson seems undaunted, believing that the middle road can prevail. ''If the left and right are both mad at you,'' he said, ''you're probably doing the right thing.''

HEADLINE: In a Shift, Biggest Wave Of Migrants Is Now Asian

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
Asians have surpassed Hispanics as the largest wave of new immigrants to the United States, pushing the population of Asian descent to a record 18.2 million and helping to make Asians the fastest-growing racial group in the country, according to a study released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center.
While Asian immigration has increased slightly in recent years, the shift in ranking is largely attributable to the sharp decline in Hispanic immigration, the study said. 
About 430,000 Asians -- or 36 percent of all new immigrants, legal and illegal -- moved to the United States in 2010, compared with 370,000 Hispanics, or 31 percent of all new arrivals, the study said. Just three years earlier, the ratio was reversed: about 390,000 Asians immigrated in 2007, compared with 540,000 Hispanics.
''Asians have become the largest stream of new immigrants to the U.S. -- and, thus, the latest leading actors in this great American drama'' of immigration, Paul Taylor, executive vice president of the Pew Research Center, wrote in the report.
Immigration scholars have attributed the decrease in Hispanic immigration to a mix of factors, including the economic downturn in the United States, increased deportation and border enforcement by the American authorities, and declining birthrates in Mexico.
Tougher enforcement measures have made a greater impact on the Hispanic immigrant population than on the Asian immigrant population because a much higher percentage of Hispanics are in the United States without immigration papers, experts said. About 45 percent of Hispanic immigrants in the United States are here illegally compared with about 13 percent to 15 percent of Asian immigrants, Pew demographers found.
Under this pressure, Hispanic immigration dropped 31 percent from 2007 to 2010, while Asian immigration increased about 10 percent.
Pew researchers estimated that Asian immigration surpassed Hispanic immigration by 2009. Mr. Taylor said in an interview on Monday that the delay in identifying this shift was due in part to the fact that the analysis relied on later demographic data, including the 2010 American Community Survey.
The findings are part of a study called ''The Rise of Asian-Americans,'' a comprehensive analysis of the Asian population in the United States. The Pew Research Center is a nonpartisan organization in Washington that has provided some of the most reliable estimates for illegal immigration.
Drawing on Census Bureau and other government data as well as telephone surveys from Jan. 3 to March 27 of more than 3,500 people of Asian descent, the 214-page study found that Asians are the highest-earning and best-educated racial group in the country.
Among Asians 25 or older, 49 percent hold a college degree, compared with 28 percent of all people in that age range in the United States. Median annual household income among Asians is $66,000 versus $49,800 among the general population.
In the survey, Asians are also distinguished by their emphasis on traditional family mores. About 54 percent of the respondents, compared with 34 percent of all adults in the country, said having a successful marriage was one of the most important goals in life; another was being a good parent, according to 67 percent of Asian adults, compared with about half of all adults in the general population.
Asians also place greater importance on career and material success, the study reported, values reflected in child-rearing styles. About 62 percent of Asians in the United States believe that most American parents do not put enough pressure on their children to do well in school.
The growth of the Asian population has been noteworthy for its speed. In 1965, after a century of exclusionary, race-based policies, the Asian share of the American population was less than 1 percent. But immigration reform legislation that year opened the door to broader immigration from around the world. The Asian share of the total population is now about 5.8 percent, the Pew study said.
''A century ago, most Asian-Americans were low-skilled, low-wage laborers crowded into ethnic enclaves and targets of official discrimination,'' the study said. ''Today they are the most likely of any major racial or ethnic group in America to live in mixed neighborhoods and to marry across racial lines.''
A closer look at the numbers can reveal sharp differences between subgroups.
At least 83 percent of the total Asian population in the United States traces its ancestry to China, the Philippines, India, Vietnam, the Korean Peninsula or Japan -- and demographic characteristics can vary widely from group to group.
Indians, for instance, lead all other Asian subgroups in income and education, the report said. Indians, Japanese and Filipinos have lower poverty rates than the general public, while Koreans, Vietnamese and Chinese have higher poverty rates.
But Mr. Taylor said there was still value in the macroanalysis. ''For better or worse, throughout our history, we've always used race as a prism to understand who we are,'' he said. ''Anything that illuminates the latest immigration wave, that illuminates a growing race group, helps us to understand ourselves better.''

HEADLINE: When ALEC Takes Over Your Town

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA

 BODY:
The Rhode Island State Legislature finally adjourned its 2012 session around 3:30 a.m. on Wednesday morning. It had been a brutal last few days.
In May, the State Senate had approved a supplemental property tax increase of 13.8 percent, to be imposed on the residents of Woonsocket, a struggling city with a $10 million deficit. But when the bill moved to the House of Representatives, two conservative Woonsocket representatives refused to go along, and no amount of late-night negotiating could change their minds. Everyone finally gave up and went home.
The state has named a budget commission to grapple with Woonsocket's money woes. Ultimately, though, a receiver may have to be appointed -- which is to say, a person not beholden to the voters, who would nonetheless have the power to abrogate union contracts and do whatever else he or she deems necessary to erase the deficit. Incredibly, the two Woonsocket legislators have pushed for a receiver, despite the pain that it would likely bring their city. 
Or maybe it's not so incredible. It turns out that one of them, Jon Brien, is also on the national board of the American Legislative Exchange Council, or ALEC. Although ALEC is probably best known for its support of the Stand Your Ground law in Florida, the conservative group has a very clear agenda for dealing with state budgets. It wants to shrink them. Although Brien has denied that he is applying the ALEC philosophy to his small city, it looks, in fact, as if that's exactly what he is doing. It's not pretty.
Woonsocket's problems stem from the decision of Rhode Island's previous governor, a Republican named Don Carcieri, to balance the state's budget by cutting state aid to the cities. All of Rhode Island's poorer cities had become dependent on that aid, so when the economy soured, they essentially ran out of money. Providence had to renegotiate the retirement benefits of its municipal workers. Central Falls actually sought bankruptcy court protection -- and a receiver was put in charge of its finances. As for Woonsocket, its current difficulties came to light last fall when the school district revealed a huge, unanticipated budget shortfall.
The two Woonsocket legislators quickly decided to apply Rahm Emanuel's famous maxim about never letting a crisis go to waste. The fact that their town had a big budget deficit meant that if they played their cards right, they could do a lot more than just fix the schools' problem. They could actually shrink the town government!
And how does one go about doing that? By refusing to go along with tax increases and forcing the city to the edge of bankruptcy, thus raising the possibility of bringing in a receiver. ''You never move faster than when you have a piano hanging over your head,'' Brien told me. ''The receiver is that piano.''
He went on to say that the municipal unions -- police, firefighters, teachers -- ''have been given pensions and benefits the city can no longer afford'' but have no incentive to renegotiate. But a receiver, with the wave of a magic wand, can instantly cut their pensions, and there isn't a thing they can do about it. When I asked Brien how bad the pension problem was in Woonsocket, he told me he didn't know. ''I'm a state legislator,'' he said. ''I don't get into that level of municipal finance.''
Here's the rub. Pensions are not the core problem in Woonsocket. Yes, Woonsocket has a pension shortfall, but it is more manageable than many other places and has almost nothing to do with the current crisis. ''The meme in Rhode Island is that if there is a problem, you can trace it back to the public employees,'' says Bob Plain, a journalist who runs the Web site RIFuture.org. In Providence, the pensions, with annual cost of living adjustment of up to 6 percent, were, indeed, a huge problem. (Note: My brother used to work for Angel Taveras, the city's mayor.) But that's just not true in Woonsocket.
Yet, in Central Falls, the receiver took an ax to retiree benefits, cutting them by 55 percent, meaning that many retirees are now getting pensions of under $20,000. The receiver has also laid off city workers, closed the city's library and shuttered a popular community center. This is the future Woonsocket now faces, thanks to its own legislators.
Shrinking government sounds appealing. We all have our favorite examples of silly regulations and bloated bureaucracies. But struggling municipalities like Woonsocket don't have a lot of fat; cutting means reducing or eliminating programs that citizens depend on. And, in any case, in a democracy, the decision of what -- and whether -- to cut should rest with elected officials who are responsible to voters, not to an unelected receiver using bankruptcy law to unilaterally make cuts.
That may be the ALEC solution, but it shouldn't be ours.
David Brooks is off today.

HEADLINE: One Wall Street Seer Says The Greek Tragedy Is Near

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
If you want to be scared, truly terrified, listen to Mark J. Grant. He might be right.
For the last two years, Mr. Grant, a managing director based in Florida at a regional investment bank, has been predicting the bankruptcy of Greece and a cascade of chaos across the global economy, attracting quite a following on Wall Street in the process.
''Greece will be forced to return to the drachma and devalue, and the default will cause bank runs and money flowing into Germany and the United States as the only viable safe haven bets,'' he declared the day before Sunday's Greek elections, irrespective of which party would win. ''Greece will default because there is no other choice regardless of anyone's politics.'' 
He then walked through the falling dominoes: ''It will hit the (European Central Bank), the banks on the other side of the derivatives contracts, all of the Greek banks who are really in default at present and being carried by Europe as well as the nation, and the Greek default will spread the infection in many places that we cannot imagine because so much is hidden and tucked away in the European financial system.''
Welcome to Doomsday, brought to you by Mr. Grant. He says he doesn't think of it as such; he calls it ''reality.'' He told me on Monday, almost hopelessly, ''There's only so much money to go around.''
In a Jan. 13, 2010, report, Mr. Grant forecast that Greece would default on its government debts, one of the first to publish such a prognostication.
Mr. Grant could be the Nouriel Roubini (Dr. Doom) of the European crisis. Mr. Roubini, the New York University economist, said the subprime-debt sky was falling for a long time before it fell. Few people listened, in part, because nobody had ever heard of him. Then, of course, the sky fell. Now everybody has heard of him. Time will tell, but soon everybody could know Mr. Grant.
The January 2010 report, written two years before Greece did indeed default, has made him the go-to forecaster of Europe's collapse for some of the world's largest investors. Nicknamed the Wizard, Mr. Grant, who works for Southwest Securities, sends out a daily report, often frightening in its detail and matter-of-factness, by e-mail to a who's who of the world's biggest institutions, hedge funds and sovereign wealth funds. Subscribers like Bill Gross, a founder of Pimco, the world's largest bond fund, pay thousands of dollars a year to receive Mr. Grant's views in their in-boxes.
Never one to sugarcoat his views, his success is partly a function of his plain-spoken way of making complex ideas simple.
''There is only one way out of this mess and that is if Europe keeps handing Greece money like one does to some aged aunt that cannot support herself, but that is a family decision,'' he wrote. But, he argues, ''Greece requires 16 other family members to support her jointly and the politics in many of these nations, including Germany, is making it difficult for the charade to continue.''
His view of European officials' effort to ''fire-wall'' the problem countries is equally simple: ''This whole subject is a ruse in my opinion. Think of horses in a corral. The rancher keeps trying to build a higher and higher fence around his horses but for what purpose? For the rancher it is to keep the wolves out.''
Mr. Grant, who loves to mix metaphors, takes his rancher metaphor further: ''The real problem is that the horses are sick, infected and that the disease of fiscal mismanagement has spread to virtually every horse in the corral except one and do not expect that one, Germany, to remain disease-free much longer.''
Layering on another metaphor, he adds: ''You can call cancer a cold if you like but it changes nothing; not one thing.''
Sadly, Mr. Grant is not predicting the default of just Greece, he's already on to Spain (he reached that conclusion before many others, too).
''The country cannot afford to pay off their regional debt, their bank debt,'' he wrote on Monday, ''and various schemes to avoid the Men in Black from taking over will not work nor will the pleas for 'more Europe' as the words mouthed by Germany are meant for placation only and will not find implementation in any kind of timeline that will make any difference.''
He has convinced himself that Germany, the only country in a position to help, will not come to the rescue. ''You can bank on one thing if nothing else; the Germans will not allow their cost of funding to rise or their standard of living to decline to help the nations that have gotten themselves in trouble. You can count on this!'' he wrote.
As we were talking on Monday, he said he wanted to make clear that he did not believe Armageddon was upon us. And it's not as if Mr. Grant is wishing this to happen, despite his boat in Fort Lauderdale, named ''Wishes Granted.''
''I don't think the world is going to hell,'' he said. ''It's very negative. What's going on is serious. It will have a whole slew of negative consequences.'' But he insisted, ''I don't think it's going to get to the 1930s.''
More likely, he said, we are headed for a bad recession with lots ''of shocks to the system.'' He says this will likely happen in the next four months unless ''there is debt forgiveness or Europe keeps handing them money like they are a ward of the state.''
''Or,'' he warned, ''it could come sooner.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Iowa: Nuns On the Road To Protest Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
A group of Roman Catholic nuns has begun a nine-state bus tour protesting proposed federal budget cuts, saying it was not trying to flout recent Vatican criticisms of socially active nuns but felt called to show how Republican policies are affecting low-income families. The tour, which started in Des Moines, was organized by Network, a Washington-based Catholic social justice group criticized in a recent Vatican report that said some organizations led by nuns have focused too much on economic injustice while failing to promote the church's teachings on abortion and same-sex marriage. The Vatican asked American bishops to look at Network's ties to another group of nuns it is reorganizing because of what the church calls ''serious doctrinal problems.'' Sister Simone Campbell, Network's executive director, said the timing of the tour was in response to consideration of the federal budget in Congress. ''We're doing this because of what's happening on the Hill,'' she said. ''We're desperate to get the word out. That's why we're doing it now.'' Fourteen nuns will rotate on and off the bus for two weeks.

HEADLINE: News Analysis: Loopholes Abound Despite New Rules

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
Bank regulators are casting new nets to catch excessive risk-taking in the financial system. But future London Whales may find plenty of ways to slip right through them.
The story of JPMorgan Chase's multibillion-dollar trading loss is now well known. Traders, including Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale, amassed large positions in credit derivatives as part of a complex trading strategy that eventually soured.
The motivations for the trades were unclear. While the bank says they were intended to offset other risks on the books, the strategy also appeared to have a speculative element. 
Nearly four years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers incited a worldwide financial crisis, such blowups are all too probable.
Banks in the United States are still operating in a sort of regulatory no-man's land. Many of the new post-crisis rules have not yet become effective. And even when they do, the loopholes remain large.
The Volcker Rule, part of the Dodd-Frank legislation that will be phased in over the next two years, is intended to catch certain types of trading. But it may not snag the wagers of JPMorgan's Whale.
While this regulation prevents banks from doing speculative trades with their own money, it will not stop hedging activities, which JPMorgan has said were at the root of the trading losses. The Volcker Rule contains guidelines that are meant to help regulators decide whether a hedge masks a proprietary bet. But even with these prescriptions, speculative trading could still slip through.
In JPMorgan's case, the bank wanted to hedge the large amount of loans and bonds on its balance sheet. To do that, its hedging strategy initially centered on buying bearish derivatives that would rise in value as the creditworthiness of large companies deteriorated. Then, in January, JPMorgan started putting on a huge bullish credit position, to help temper the bearish bet - essentially, a hedge on a hedge.
To help distinguish between hedges and speculation, the rule asks the banks to be able to show that the hedges have a relationship with the assets being hedged. However, it requires only that they be ''reasonably correlated.'' The rule says that hedges are allowed if they are ''made in connection with, and related to, individual or aggregated positions.'' JPMorgan could point to that and argue that the Whale's trades were related to the bank's corporate loans and bonds.
Other parts of Dodd-Frank try to temper risk in more subtle ways. The regulatory overhaul tries to move many derivatives onto central clearinghouses, entities that handle the underlying payments on a trade. This is supposed to strengthen the derivatives markets, because the clearinghouses will force participants to back their trades with margin payments made in cash or very safe securities. In theory, the financial burden of supplying margin to clearinghouses could make Whale-type trades prohibitively expensive, and therefore less attractive for banks.
But the main type of derivative in the Whale's loss-making trade - a credit index called the CDX.NA.IG.9 - is already centrally cleared in large amounts, according to figures from ICE Clear, a clearinghouse that handles that index. If JPMorgan's positions are executed through a clearinghouse, it would mean that the added costs of clearing did not prove a deterrent, and might not stop similar traders in the future.
However, one part of this net may work. Some derivatives analysts think JPMorgan may be exposed to ''tranches'' of the CDX.NA.IG.9 index. Tranches slice up credit indexes in such a way that participants can choose to take on more or less credit risk. Tranches of the CDX.NA.IG.9 are not executed through a clearinghouse.
That is a crucial issue, because regulators are planning to demand much higher margin payments on derivatives that are not centrally cleared. If regulators do set this margin above clearinghouse levels, such trades may become too expensive for banks.
But some analysts think the extra margin may not be a sufficient deterrent. ''If it is a trade you really believe in, you may still go ahead and do it, even if it is more expensive,'' said Olu Sonola, an analyst at Fitch Ratings.
Another effective measure may stem from the new international banking regulations set by the Basel committee. On paper, they will force banks to hold a lot more capital against certain trading positions, even ones using centrally-cleared derivatives.
The new Basel rules' impact on JPMorgan's credit bets could prove substantial, which the bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, indicated last week in his Congressional testimony. In the fourth quarter of last year, he said, the latest Basel rules stood to increase the ''risk-weighted'' value of the credit derivatives portfolio that contains the Whale's trades to $60 billion, from $20 billion.
Under Basel, a bank sets capital as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Consequently, a tripling of the position's risk-weighted size would lead to a tripling of capital held against it. Notably, proposed Basel trading rules could force banks to hold more capital if regulators see evidence that hedges may not perform effectively in stressed situations, said Jerome McCluskey, a lawyer at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy.
But again it seems there may be an out. In his testimony, Mr. Dimon implied that JPMorgan thought the large bullish bets would actually make its credit derivatives portfolio less onerous under new Basel rules. It's possible that JPMorgan misread the Basel rules, or miscalculated the risks of the trade when setting its risk-weighted value. Even if both are true, it remains that the bank thought tens of billions of dollars in new trades - trades that ultimately blew up - would sail straight through Basel net.
All that means the Whale is far from extinct on Wall Street.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Oracle's Results Surpass Analysts' Expectations

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Oracle reported financial results late Monday that exceeded Wall Street's expectations and said it would buy back up to $10 billion of its shares. But the bigger surprise was the timing of the company's announcement; the numbers were not expected to be released until Thursday.
Safra Catz, Oracle's chief financial officer, told analysts in a hastily scheduled conference call that the company did not think investors would mind hearing about a solid quarter amid unsettling fears about how Europe's shaky economy might be affecting business conditions. 
It was still a puzzling decision, given that the announcement conflicted with an event in Los Angeles held by Microsoft to unveil a tablet computer to compete against Apple's iPad. The overlap meant that some of the securities analysts who follow Oracle were focused on the Microsoft announcement.
For its fiscal fourth quarter, Oracle reported an 8 percent increase in net income that topped analysts' predictions. Oracle also posted a 7 percent gain in its sales of new software licenses, indicating that there was still strong demand for technology that helps businesses automate administrative tasks.
Oracle is viewed as a technology bellwether because it sells software and high-end computers to companies and government agencies throughout the world.
In another encouraging sign, Oracle's decision to spend an additional $10 billion buying back its stock should help increase Oracle's future per-share earnings by reducing the number of outstanding shares. Based on Monday's closing price of Oracle's stock, the $10 billion would buy about 369 million, or 7 percent, of the company's roughly five billion outstanding shares. Oracle spent about $6 billion buying back 207 million shares in its last fiscal year.
Oracle shares rose 96 cents, or more than 3 percent, to $28.08 in after-hours trading on Monday. The stock had dropped 58 cents in Monday's regular trading session as investors reacted to the unconfirmed reports of several analysts who said they had been told by unidentified industry officials that Oracle was cutting its ties with Keith Block, its top North American sales executive for the last decade.
The company did not address Mr. Block's status in Monday's quarterly release or in the ensuing conference call.
For its quarter ending in May, Oracle earned $3.45 billion, or 69 cents a share, up from net income of $3.2 billion, or 62 cents a share, at the same time last year.
Not counting acquisition expenses and other costs, Oracle said it would have earned 82 cents a share. On that basis, Oracle exceeded the average estimate of 78 cents a share held among analysts surveyed by FactSet.
Revenue edged up 1 percent from last year to $10.9 billion, slightly higher than analyst projections.
If not for a stronger dollar, which hurt the company's results outside the United States, Oracle said its revenue would have increased by 5 percent from the same time last year.
Software licensing revenue would have increased by 11 percent if currency exchange rates had remained at the same level as last year.
Investors focus on sales of new software because the new licenses unleash a stream of future revenue from maintenance and software upgrades. Oracle expects its software licenses for the current quarter ending in August to range from a 1 percent decrease from the same time last year to a 9 percent increase.
Oracle is still struggling to diversify into hardware. Revenue from the sale of hardware products during the latest quarter declined 16 percent from the same time last year. The sagging hardware sales have raised questions about Oracle's decision to buy Sun Microsystems, a struggling maker of high-end computers, for $7.3 billion two years ago.

HEADLINE: American Children, Now Struggling to Adjust to Life in Mexico

BYLINE: By DAMIEN CAVE; Shaul Schwarz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
IZUCAR DE MATAMOROS, Mexico -- Jeffrey Isidoro sat near the door of his fifth-grade classroom here in central Mexico, staring outside through designer glasses that, like his Nike sneakers and Nike backpack, signaled a life lived almost entirely in the United States. His parents are at home in Mexico. Jeffrey is lost.
When his teacher asked in Spanish how dolphins communicate, a boy next to him reached over to underline the right answer. When it was Jeffrey's turn to read, his classmates laughed and shouted ''en ingles, en ingles'' -- causing Jeffrey to blush.
''Houston is home,'' Jeffrey said during recess, in English. ''The houses and stuff here, it's all a little strange. I feel, like, uncomfortable.'' 
Never before has Mexico seen so many American Jeffreys, Jennifers and Aidens in its classrooms. The wave of deportations in the past few years, along with tougher state laws and persistent unemployment, have all created a mass exodus of Mexican parents who are leaving with their American sons and daughters.
In all, 1.4 million Mexicans -- including about 300,000 children born in the United States -- moved to Mexico between 2005 and 2010, according to Mexican census figures. That is roughly double the rate of southbound migration from 1995 to 2000, and new government data published this month suggest that the flow is not diminishing. The result is an entire generation of children who blur the line between Mexican and American.
''It's really a new phenomenon,'' said Victor Zuniga, a sociologist at the University of Monterrey, in Nuevo Leon State, which borders Texas. ''It's the first time in the relationship between Mexico and the United States that we have a generation of young people sharing both societies during the early years of their lives.''
Critics of immigration have mostly welcomed the mass departure, but demographers and educators worry that far too many American children are being sent to schools in Mexico that are not equipped to integrate them. And because research shows that most of these children plan to return to the United States, some argue that what is Mexico's challenge today will be an American problem tomorrow, with a new class of emerging immigrants: young adults with limited skills, troubled childhoods and the full rights of American citizenship.
''These kinds of changes are really traumatic for kids,'' said Marta Tienda, a sociologist at Princeton who was born in Texas to Mexican migrant laborers. ''It's going to stick with them.''
Jeffrey's situation is increasingly common. His father, Tomas Isidoro, 39, a carpenter, was one of the 46,486 immigrants deported in the first half of 2011 who said they had American children, according to a report by Immigration and Customs Enforcement to Congress. That is eight times the half-year average for such removals from 1998 to 2007.
Mr. Isidoro, wearing a Dallas Cowboys hat in his parents' kitchen, said he was still angry that his 25 years of work in the United States meant nothing; that being caught with a broken taillight on his vehicle and without immigration papers meant more than having two American sons -- Jeffrey, 10, and his brother, Tommy Jefferson, 2, who was named after the family's favorite president.
As for President Obama, Mr. Isidoro uttered an expletive. ''There are all these drug addicts, drug dealers, people who do nothing in the United States, and you're going to kick people like me out,'' he said. ''Why?''
White House officials have said that under a new policy focused on criminals, fewer parents of American children are being deported for minor offenses. On Friday, the Obama administration also announced that hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants who came to United States as children would be allowed to stay without fear of deportation. The policy, however, does not grant legal status, and because nearly half of the country's 10.2 million illegal immigrant adults have children, experts say that inevitably more families will be divided -- especially if deportations over all hold steady around 400,000 a year.
But for Jeffrey, the impact of his father's removal in June last year was immediate. His grades dipped. His mother, Leivi Rodriguez, 32, worried that he had become more distant, from both his friends and his studies. Almost every day, Jeffrey told her he wanted to see his father.
So six months after her husband's deportation, she sent Jeffrey to live with his father in Mexico, and she followed with Tommy a few months later. It was December when he arrived here in a hill town south of Mexico City, surrounded by fields of swaying sugar cane. On Jeffrey's first night, he noticed something strange in his bed. ''Dad, what's that?'' he asked.
''A scorpion,'' his father said.
School here presented new challenges, as well. Jeffrey went hungry at first because neither he nor his father realized that without a cafeteria, students relied on their parents to bring them food at recess.
In class, Jeffrey's level of confusion rises and falls. His teacher said she struggled to keep him from daydreaming. ''His body is here, but his mind -- who knows where it is,'' she said.
Houston -- that is where Jeffrey's thoughts typically drift. There, he had friends, McDonald's, the zoo. It is where he lingered at the library at Gleason Elementary to catch up on his favorite series of books, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid.'' There, his school had a playground; here, there is just a concrete slab. There, computers were common; here, there are none.
''It was just better,'' Jeffrey said.
The educational disparities between Mexico and the United States are not always so stark. At the elementary level, some of Mexico's schools are on par with, or even stronger than, the overcrowded, underfinanced American schools that serve many immigrant children, education experts say.
But Mexican schools lag when it comes to secondary education. In many areas of Mexico, especially places where the tradition of migration is not as well established, Mexico's educational bureaucracy can make life difficult for new arrivals like Jeffrey. It is not uncommon for American students to be barred from enrollment for a year or more because they lack proper documents.
''The established rules for registration don't need to be so severe,'' said Armando Reynoso Carrillo, a state legislator from Malinalco, a rural area in Mexico State where dozens of American children have arrived in recent years.
The problems extend beyond registration. Mexicans have a long history of greeting returnees with skepticism -- for abandoning Mexico, or because they resent the United States, or view those who moved there as materialistic, culturally out of touch and arrogant. The prejudice often extends to their children.
Graciela Trevino Gonzalez said that when she returned to Malinalco three years ago, after more than a decade in California, she could not get her American son onto a soccer team because the coaches refused to accept him without Mexican identification. ''He felt rejected by everyone,'' she said. ''The kids called him 'leche,' 'gringo' -- it was awful.'' Leche means milk and gringo can range from a neutral reference to a foreigner to a slur.
Here in the central state of Puebla, Mexican children are especially likely to see transnational students as different, according to surveys by Mr. Zuniga, the sociologist. Some have come to Mexico because of deportations. Others arrived because relatives were sick or without work.
But regardless of the cause, Mexican students tend to see their American-educated colleagues as strangers. Jeffrey's experience is typical: He is friendly and quick to open up in English, but quieter at school, where Spanish is the only language one hears.
At one point this spring, as Jeffrey sat at the edge of the playground, a larger boy approached from behind and asked if he was from Florida or Houston. When Jeffrey pulled away because the boy had leaned into him, the bigger boy seemed surprised. ''Are you mad?'' he asked.
Later, other boys tested Jeffrey on his English, asking him in Spanish to translate various body parts.
''How do you say foot?'' one asked. ''Finger?''
''Eye?''
Jeffrey provided one-word answers without enthusiasm. At home, a three-room concrete box with furniture hauled from Houston, he said that many of the children called him Four Eyes. He said he was starting to feel more comfortable academically and socially, but even in a school with 11 other children born or educated in the United States (out of 296) he is still a foreigner. Sometimes, he confuses the Mexican pledge of allegiance with the American version.
Ms. Tienda, at Princeton, said children of Jeffrey's age were more likely to struggle with such a difficult transition. ''This is the age where they start to be aware of each other's differences,'' she said. ''They're preadolescents and their identity is being crystallized.''
She added that how these students fared over the long term will probably vary widely. Some will make the transition easily while others will suffer setback after setback. It will depend on their language skills, school and family dynamics.
Jeffrey, like many other children whose parents have moved them to a country they do not know, seems to be teetering between catching up to his classmates and falling further behind. His parents are struggling to find work and keep their marriage together. Jeffrey, in quieter moments, said he was just trying to endure until he could go home.
''I dream, like, I'm sleeping in the United States,'' he said. ''But when I wake up, I'm in Mexico.''

HEADLINE: Life and Camaraderie After the Games

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN

 BODY:
They may be Olympians, but no one is ever going to mistake Tara Lipinski, Sasha Cohen, Sarah Hughes, Jeremy Bloom or Joey Cheek for beach volleyball champions.
This is evident the minute the five athletes step onto the sand at Chelsea Piers and start lobbing balls over the net. It's not that they aren't impeccable physical specimens. It's just that their milieu is in the cold, on the ice and snow, where they have skied and skated their way to glory.
The women, tiny and in black leggings, leap and nose-dive into the sand, like, well, figure skaters botching a triple lutz.
''I can't even see over the net!'' said the 5-foot-1 Lipinski, 30, who won a gold at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, Japan, when she was all of 15 years old. 
''Why'd you all become skaters again?'' joked Cheek, 32, a speedskater who took a first place at the 2006 Olympics in Turin, Italy.
This informal outing is the idea of Bloom, the two-time Olympic skier and former professional football player (Philadelphia Eagles and Pittsburgh Steelers), who began organizing monthly get-togethers about six months ago, when he moved to Manhattan from Colorado. The idea was to do something active with his Olympic buddies -- rock-climb, walk along the West Side Highway, swing from a trapeze (that idea got axed after it was revealed that Lipinski is afraid of heights) -- and then grab a meal and conversation. To them, the activity doesn't matter as much as the companionship.
''It feels like family in a weirder way than just friends,'' Lipinski said.
The five athletes met 10 years ago at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, and stayed vaguely in touch, reconnecting when they randomly ended up in New York City. Cohen, 29, is an undergraduate at Columbia University, where she is studying financial economics; Hughes, 27, a Yale graduate, is writing a book about figure skating; Cheek, who just graduated from Princeton University, has started a sports-related Web site, DailyHouse.com; and Lipinski recently relocated from Los Angeles, where she was a TV commentator for figure skating.
But the nucleus is Bloom, co-founder of the Internet company Integrate.com, which recently received an $11 million infusion in venture capital. ''He's like an older brother to me,'' Cohen said of the 30-year-old Bloom.
Hughes, who won a gold medal in 2002, calls it ''mutual admiration.'' ''When we started skating we were so young,'' she said. ''We didn't really get a chance to spend time together. Now we can enjoy each other.''
The group bands together in part because they are friends, but also because they have a shared language. They don't have to explain their histories; they know what it's like to spend their youth ''refrigerated,'' as Cohen put it, rather than roaming the mall with their pals. They know how it feels to ache so much that it hurts to swallow.
''We've led similar existences,'' Bloom said. ''There's a real camaraderie.''
And they get each other's intensity. ''We can all flip a switch if we want to,'' he said. The way he sees it, everyone is responsible for his or her own destiny. ''If you don't see luck in your life, start being the last one to go to bed at night and the first to wake up in the morning,'' he said.
While it's easy to dismiss the Tony Robbins speak, Bloom isn't just spouting feel-good pop psychology. You don't rack up 14 gold medals by age 23 without a little self-discipline.
Indeed, to say they all have Type A personalities is a bit like saying that Don Draper has been unfaithful on occasion -- the understatement of the year. But what strikes most is how driven they are, and how unlikely it is that they will spiral downward like others who have peaked at an early age.
''I think we have an extreme value for our life and time,'' Cohen said. ''I'm very committed to what brings us fulfillment.''
To that end, they are, in their own ways, each trying to make a mark in the world outside of sports. Cheek, for example, co-founded Team Darfur, an international coalition of athletes committed to bringing an end to the crisis in Darfur, where he traveled with George Clooney. In 2007, Bloom started the Wish of a Lifetime (seniorwish.org), which grants wishes to senior citizens worldwide.
''My biggest fear of quitting sports was -- what's next?'' Bloom said. ''What the hell is my life going to look like now? I worried that I was going to be worthless to society.''
They all have a different response to the sports that made them famous. Lipinski said that when she has a bad day, the first place she wants to go is the ice. ''It's a love-hate thing,'' she said. ''I feel like I'm defined by it.''
Cheek -- whose visage once graced a Wheaties box -- said he no longer owns skates, and has only hit the ice a dozen times over the last six years. ''I'm really good at skating really fast in a circle,'' he said. ''What a bizarre thing to be good at.''
Not that his competitive spirit has disappeared. Back at Chelsea Piers, Cheek is ready to roll. ''Let's try this for realsies,'' he said, after the group has smacked balls back and forth for a good 20 minutes. They decide to play to seven.
Bloom instructs his team, which consists of Cohen and Lipinski, on strategy. ''You take the side, I'll take the middle, and you take west,'' he said.
Lipinski's smile evaporates. ''I have my focus face on,'' she said.
Hughes hurls the ball right into the net. Thwack! She laughs at Cheek. ''He's very upset that I'm not serving from behind the line,'' she announces cheerfully.
By the end of the game, Bloom's team has won, 7-5. Although it is a small triumph, it is a win nonetheless. Victory!
''I'm tired!'' Cohen said.
Membership in the group is typically relegated to winter sport athletes, but Bloom said he was willing to consider others on a contingency basis. ''Andre Agassi is welcome to submit an application,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Dropping Helmet Laws to Reduce a Town's Risk

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
MILTON, Wash. -- Will the nanny state take away our right to drink too much soda? Will the police rob us of privacy in the name of fighting terrorism? In an era of polarized politics, the fear of government encroachment is one thing that unifies Americans from the left and the right.
But here's a news flash from the municipal trenches, where local governments these days worry more about keeping the lights on: The discussion about government's role in places like this struggling former lumber town centers less on philosophy or politics than on practicality, triage and risk. And now that dynamic has led to an unlikely place in the road: helmet laws. 
For 15 years, until June 1, Milton, population 7,000, 45 minutes south of Seattle, required helmets for all bicyclists and skateboarders. But with its 12-officer police force stressed by an increase in domestic violence, alcohol abuse and property crime, all of which surged through the recession, law enforcement priorities now go way beyond hectoring people about their headgear.
And an inability to enforce a law on the books, the town's insurance consultant argued, created administrative unevenness that -- in the event of an accident by someone who was not nagged or cited about helmet use -- posed a liability risk that could bankrupt the community with one swipe from a punitive-minded jury.
So in a unanimous vote of the City Council on May 21, helmet laws went the way of Milton's library and fire department, both of which closed in 2010 and were replaced by regionally shared systems with neighboring communities. The city's planning department and activities director are also now just chapters of local history. Projected tax revenues for Milton's general fund budget have fallen to $3.9 million from $4.9 million in 2010, and Mayor Debra Perry said she was not at all sure yet what else might have to go.
There is one thing she is clear and adamant about, though: helmets are good, notwithstanding anything in the legal code. She said she hoped to organize a safety fair and helmet drive this summer to push the connection between helmet use and safety. What was a requirement -- though unevenly enforced in the best of times -- is now, she said, a point of moral suasion and conversation within the community.
''Of course you should wear a helmet,'' she said in an interview in her office. ''But this is a parents issue -- parents need to be supervising their children, making sure their children are well dressed and have helmets on. Wearing flip-flops and shorts and no helmets on skateboards and bikes is just stupid.''
Milton's decision on helmets has also tapped into an old and divisive debate in the broader bicycling community about how best to get people out of their cars and onto saddles.
Some bike advocacy groups in fact oppose helmet laws for adults and have applauded Milton's new path. They say the focus must be on pushing communities to create safer biking conditions through more bike lanes and trails, car speed-limit reductions and other measures, and that helmet laws put the onus on bikers to be safe, letting cities off the hook in making safer terrain. For both sides, though, it comes back to money.
''Is it worth passing something that you're not going to enforce?'' said Andy Clarke, the president of the League of American Bicyclists, one of the nation's oldest biking advocacy groups, which has maintained neutrality on the helmet law debate. ''That's a responsible question to ask, especially in this day and age when the role of government is questioned at every turn,'' added Mr. Clarke, who says he sometimes goes bareheaded.
Currently, 21 states and the District of Columbia require helmets for children and teenagers. Washington State, for whatever reason, has more local ordinances like Milton's former law, requiring helmets for all ages, than any other state, according to the Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute, a nonprofit group.
Milton has no bike lanes but not much traffic, either, and many people seemed unaware that the city ever had a helmet statute.
''It should be a personal decision for the person who's doing the activity -- how much they value their life,'' said Jason Weems, 28, who was out for a run on a recent afternoon, and who also bikes -- always, he said, with a helmet, strictly by personal choice.
His wife, Kerrie, 29, who was pushing a stroller behind him with their 7-month-old son, Oliver, disagreed, and said Milton's law had been worthwhile even if it had nudged only a few people into helmet use. ''Just like buckling up in a car -- that's mandatory, so why wouldn't it be for wearing a helmet on a bike?'' she asked.
One unexpected byproduct of the repeal debate, to gauge by people like Barry Minnes, 63, could be a kind of increased sympathy for local government's many dilemmas. Mr. Minnes rides for fitness in his neighborhood and watches people run through a stop sign near his home on a street that was once patrolled by the police. He understands that resources are limited. What people do on their own when the police are not looking, he said, is the question.
''I realize government has to pick and choose where they enforce,'' he said. ''It's kind of hard to draw a line to where you say the government should protect us from stupidity.''

 ''Of course you should wear a helmet,'' said Mayor Debra Perry, who emphasized that using one is a matter of safety. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY MATTHEW RYAN WILLIAMS FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) MAPS: Milton, population 7,000, is 45 minutes south of Seattle.

HEADLINE: Flier Satisfaction Suffers As More Seats Squeeze In

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY. 
E-mail: jsharkey@nytimes.com

 BODY:
LET me spill a secret here. The truth is, I really do not like to travel, even though I have to.
Days before I'm due to fly, I turn gloomy. ''You'd think you were going into the hospital for open-heart surgery rather than going to the airport for a flight to New Orleans,'' my wife told me recently.
Evidently, I am not alone. Last week, J. D. Power and Associates released its annual North American airline satisfaction report, which showed that overall passenger satisfaction with airlines declined this year after two years of small improvements. The study measured customer evaluations of fares and fees, in-flight services, boarding and baggage, flight crew, check-in and reservations, and the airplane cabin and seating. 
Another evaluation comes from the American Customer Satisfaction Index, to be officially released Tuesday. It found that while overall passenger satisfaction increased slightly this year, ''air travel continues to be problematic, with low passenger satisfaction, rising prices, expanding fees and generally poor customer service.''
The small gain in that index was the result of fewer people complaining about checked-bag fees. It wasn't because passengers had accepted the fees, but because they were ''becoming savvier and avoiding checking luggage,'' the report said, adding, ''The number of passengers surveyed who checked luggage dropped by nearly 20 percent from a year ago.''
That certainly underscores the fact, addressed here recently, that a lot of passengers are making the flying experience worse by lugging on bags, including oversize bags, that would have once been checked. To address the problem of overhead bins that can't handle the added cargo, airlines are considering adding fees at the gate area to check oversize bags. Alaska Airlines already has such fees. The bags are now checked there free if they can't fit on board.
Interestingly, both J. D. Power and American Customer Satisfaction found that passengers favored two airlines that did not charge for checked bags, JetBlue Airways and Southwest Airlines. Southwest allowed two free checked bags; JetBlue allowed one. The J. D. Power and American Customer Satisfaction Index both put JetBlue on top in customer satisfaction, edging Southwest.
Both reports suggested there was, beyond baggage concerns, a more general area of dissatisfaction, and that was the overall in-flight experience, especially in the coach cabin. J. D. Power, for example, said attitudes toward ''a carrier's process and people, rather than price'' were the main drivers of passenger satisfaction.
Those of us consigned to the cheap seats in coach are tired of being uncomfortable on airplanes, even as those in the high-price business- and first-class cabins -- and the new higher-price premium economy seats -- enjoy extra space and service, which are especially lavish on international flights.
Consider, for example, the gushing reports filed by world airline reporters after a recent media trip to Lufthansa headquarters in Frankfurt about the comforts in first and business class on Lufthansa's new 747-8 airplanes. But they generally overlooked the fact that these behemoths hold 362 passengers -- 262 of them stuffed into coach seats with a scant 31 inches of legroom, in rows that are 10 seats across. That makes for a very long trip back there in Row 43 from Frankfurt to Washington Dulles, I'd guess.
Similarly, Southwest Airlines recently received effusive publicity as it began rolling out its new cabin designs, which it called Evolve: The New Southwest Interior. These cabins are definitely nicer, with redesigned lightweight seats that provide a better sense of ''personal living space,'' as Southwest puts it.
On the other hand, the new seats for the Southwest 737s have 31 inches of pitch, instead of the previous 32 inches. This allows Southwest to squeeze one extra row of seats onto the planes, increasing passenger capacity to 143 from 137 while adding ''greater revenue potential,'' as Southwest said.
I would suggest that simple physics is at work in coach cabins, however smart the interior design. Joe Brancatelli, the publisher of the subscription Web site Joesentme.com, agreed.
''I don't want a sense of space. I want the space,'' he said. With all the cutbacks, ''there's nothing left in coach except space, so it really comes down to how much you can get.''
That is, how much you're willing to pay for, as major airlines increasingly slice and dice those coach sections to entice business travelers with slightly more space -- but at a much higher price. A looming question is whether corporate travel managers will be willing to approve those extra fees for better space in the cramped coach cabin.
Incidentally, the Global Business Travel Association recently compiled a handbook to help travel managers ''demystify'' the expanding array of airline fees, said Joseph Bates, the senior research director. Until making the list, ''we didn't fully understand the universe of these fees, even while some travel managers are trying to put these fees into their policies to say what they will reimburse and what they will not reimburse,'' he said.
''Passengers want it all, but they are not necessarily willing to pay for it all,'' Stuart Greif, a J. D. Power vice president, said in the report. ''Carriers often must make decisions for financial reasons that they know will negatively impact customer satisfaction, and therein lies the conundrum.''

HEADLINE: Lost in Recession, Toll on Underemployed and Underpaid

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER; Robbie Brown contributed reporting from Atlanta; Malia Wollan from El Cerrito, Calif.; and Ian Lovett from Los Angeles.

 BODY:
Throughout the Great Recession and the not-so-great recovery, the most commonly discussed measure of misery has been unemployment. But many middle-class and working-class people who are fortunate enough to have work are struggling as well, which is why Sherry Woods, a 59-year-old van driver from Atlanta, found herself standing in line at a jobs fair this month, with her resume tucked inside a Bible.
She opened it occasionally to reread a favorite verse from Philippians: ''And my God will meet all your needs according to the riches of his glory in Christ.''
Ms. Woods's current job has not been meeting her needs. When she began driving a passenger van last year, she earned $9 an hour and worked 40 hours a week. Then her wage was cut to $8 an hour, and her hours were drastically scaled back. Last month she earned just $233. So Ms. Woods, who said that she had been threatened with eviction for missing rent payments and had been postponing an appointment with the eye doctor because she lacks insurance, has been looking for another, better job. It has not been easy. 
''I'm looking for something else, anything else,'' she said. ''More hours. Better pay. Actual benefits.''
These are anxious days for American workers. Many, like Ms. Woods, are underemployed. Others find pay that is simply not keeping up with their expenses: adjusted for inflation, the median hourly wage was lower in 2011 than it was a decade earlier, according to data from a forthcoming book by the Economic Policy Institute, ''The State of Working America, 12th Edition.'' Good benefits are harder to come by, and people are staying longer in jobs that they want to leave, afraid that they will not be able to find something better. Only 2.1 million people quit their jobs in March, down from the 2.9 million people who quit in December 2007, the first month of the recession.
''Unfortunately, the wage problems brought on by the recession pile on top of a three-decade stagnation of wages for low- and middle-wage workers,'' said Lawrence Mishel, the president of the Economic Policy Institute, a research group in Washington that studies the labor market. ''In the aftermath of the financial crisis, there has been persistent high unemployment as households reduced debt and scaled back purchases. The consequence for wages has been substantially slower growth across the board, including white-collar and college-educated workers.''
Now, with the economy shaping up as the central issue of the presidential election, both President Obama and Mitt Romney have been relentlessly trying to make the case that their policies would bring prosperity back. The unease of voters is striking: in a New York Times/CBS News poll in April, half of the respondents said they thought the next generation of Americans would be worse off, while only about a quarter said it would have a better future.
And household wealth is dropping. The Federal Reserve reported last week that the economic crisis left the median American family in 2010 with no more wealth than in the early 1990s, wiping away two decades of gains. With stocks too risky for many small investors and savings accounts paying little interest, building up a nest egg is a challenge even for those who can afford to sock away some of their money.
Expenses like putting a child through college -- where tuition has been rising faster than inflation or wages -- can be a daunting task. When Morgan Woodward, 21, began her freshman year at the University of California, Berkeley, three years ago, her parents paid about $9,000 a year in tuition and fees. Now they pay closer to $13,000, and they are bracing for the possibility of another jump next year. With their incomes flat, though, they recently borrowed money to pay for her final year, and to begin paying the tuition of their son, who plans to start college this fall.
''You know there is going to be small incremental increases in tuition, but not the 8, 10, 12 percent increase every year we've seen,'' said Ms. Woodward's father, Cliff Woodward, 52, who lives in Pleasanton, Calif., and is an independent sales representative for an eyeglass company. So the Woodwards, who drive cars with 150,000 and 120,000 miles on them, have cut back.
''No vacations, no big screens,'' Mr. Woodward said. ''We've cut down on going out a little bit, but it's worth it.''
People with college degrees still get jobs with better pay and benefits than those without, but many recent college graduates are finding it hard to land the kinds of jobs they had envisioned. David Thande, 27, who graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, five years ago, works part time as a clerk in an Apple Store.
''I'm not even full time, so I spend about 45 minutes every day begging people for hours, checking if someone canceled, struggling to make it work,'' Mr. Thande said, adding that he had fallen behind on paying back his student loans.
Garland Miller, 28, who has degrees in finance and accounting from the University of Georgia and Kennesaw State University, had hoped to land a job at a big accounting firm, and to have been able to buy a home by now. Instead he finds himself working as the lead server at a steakhouse. But he has not given up on trying to move into the field that he prepared himself for: This month, he attended a jobs fair in Duluth, a suburb of Atlanta, organized by the University of Georgia for its alumni.
''I'm not in a job where I'm using all of my skills,'' Mr. Miller said. He said that with many baby boomers unable to retire as early as they had hoped, there are fewer opportunities for younger workers to move up and take their places. ''Instead you have everybody competing for entry-level positions,'' he said.
Things are much worse for people without college degrees, though. The real entry-level hourly wage for men who recently graduated from high school fell to $11.68 last year, from $15.64 in 1979, according to data from the Economic Policy Institute. And the percentage of those jobs that offer health insurance has plummeted to 22.8 percent, from 63.3 percent in 1979.
Though inflation has stayed relatively low in recent years, it has remained high for some of the most important things: college, health care and even, recently, food. The price of food in the home rose by 4.8 percent last year, one of the biggest jumps in the last two decades.
Sam Chea, 38, who lives in Oakland and works nights delivering pizzas for Domino's, said that he had been feeling the pinch at grocery stores, and worried that his lack of a college education was making it harder for him to find decent work. The other day he went to the nearby city of El Cerrito to apply for a second job at Nation's Giant Hamburgers, a regional chain.
''I'll be more secure with another job,'' he said. ''It's scary. I don't have an education, and I'm worried about my rent.''
''Everything's gone up. Rent went up, gas went up, food went up, milk went up, cheeseburgers went up, even cigarettes went up,'' said Mr. Chea, who had stopped at the barbershop to spiff up before his job interview. ''I'm used to getting a haircut for $6 or $7, but they charged me $9. Even haircuts have gone up.''

HEADLINE: Fed to Meet As Threats To Growth Dominate

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In retrospect, this might not have been the best week for a long-scheduled meeting of the Federal Reserve's policy-making committee.
Fed officials will convene Tuesday and Wednesday to decide whether the economy needs more help amid considerable uncertainty about the rate of domestic growth and about the impact of the latest developments in Europe's lingering crisis.
The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and other committee members suggested in public appearances this month that they were not yet convinced the rate of growth was slowing, nor that another round of aid was warranted. More time and more data might well have provided greater clarity. 
But the Fed is scheduled to complete this month its most recent effort to reduce interest rates, known as Operation Twist, and financial analysts warn that the central bank, if it does not announce a new program, could disappoint investors who have come to expect intermittent injections of monetary policy.
''While the Fed hates being held hostage by market expectations, we doubt it will be prepared to disappoint global investors this week,'' Lou Crandall, chief economist at Wrightson ICAP, wrote in a note to clients on Monday.
The Fed also confronts a particularly complex version of its necessary but impossible task of predicting the future. Two unusually tangible risks loom large. Events in Europe could freeze financial markets and political dysfunction in Washington could push the domestic economy back into recession.
Central banks typically are reluctant to stimulate growth in the expectation of a slowdown, fearing they will end up doing too much. But the Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, suggested this month that this might be the rare moment when the central bank should consider prophylactic measures.
''It may well be appropriate to ensure against adverse shocks that could push the economy into territory where a self-reinforcing downward spiral of economic weakness would be difficult to arrest,'' Ms. Yellen said.
The Fed is already engaged in a substantial and multilayered campaign to enhance growth. It has kept short-term interest rates near zero since late 2008, and said that it planned to maintain that policy until late 2014, at least. It has bought more than $2 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage securities to further reduce long-term interest rates. And in a program scheduled to end this month, it has shifted the composition of its portfolio to press down even harder on long-term rates.
Mr. Bernanke has been clear about the threshold for additional action, telling Congress the decision hinged on whether the Fed expected the economy to grow fast enough to reduce unemployment, as inflation remains firmly in check.
''That's the essential decision,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''Will there be enough growth going forward to make material progress on the unemployment rate?''
The 12 members of the committee will arrive with updated economic forecasts, which will be published Wednesday after the Fed announces any changes in policy. Mr. Bernanke also plans to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon.
If the Fed decides to act, a wide range of analysts said the central bank was most likely to extend its current campaign, Operation Twist. The program involves the sale of short-term securities to finance the purchase of securities with longer terms, putting downward pressure on long-term rates.
Alternatively, the Fed could take the more modest step of announcing that it intends to hold short-term rates near zero beyond 2014. It also could take the more forceful step of expanding its investment portfolio.
David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said he expected the Fed to announce that it would buy a mix of Treasuries and mortgage securities to further reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
''Had there been a major risk-on rally in financial markets in response to the election outcome in Greece we might have lost a bit of confidence,'' he wrote in a note to clients Monday. ''But it seems clear that there is no such response forthcoming and thus we continue to expect a significant policy announcement from the Fed.''
Republicans have been vocal in their opposition to new actions by the Fed, while Democrats have offered relatively little public support.
Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said Sunday that another round of asset purchases would most likely do more harm than good.
The last round of purchases ''did not put Americans back to work, did not raise our home values, did not bring jobs back to this country or encourage small businesses to open their doors,'' Mr. Romney said on CBS's ''Face the Nation.''
As for the consequences, Mr. Romney said the program was ''not extraordinarily harmful, but it does put in question the future value of the dollar and it will obviously encourage some inflation down the road.''
Most studies of the Fed's actions have concluded that asset purchases provide a modest boost to the economy, although other obstacles have muted the impact. People who cannot qualify for a loan do not benefit from low rates.
Inflation remains near the 2 percent annual rate that the Fed regards as most conducive to steady long-term economic growth, and Fed officials maintain that asset purchases will not increase the pace of inflation.
Analysts said the benefits of additional action would be marginal, particularly if the Fed chose to extend Operation Twist for a few months.
But they said the Fed still might tip back into action to avoid giving the impression that the end of Operation Twist signaled a reduction in its efforts to stimulate growth. Fed officials argue that the impact will endure so long as the assets remain in the Fed's portfolio, but they acknowledge that perceptions could undermine that reality. If the markets decide the Fed is pulling back, rates could rise.
Martin Schwerdtfeger, a senior economist at TD Bank in Toronto, predicted last week that the Fed would not act at this meeting unless the outcome of the Greek elections unnerved financial markets. But he said Monday that he had concluded the Fed might act simply to avoid unnerving markets itself.
''If I had to bet money on it today, I would say there is a 50 percent chance,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Global Economy Limits Expectations at Earth Summit in Brazil

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO and JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Global leaders, development experts, bankers, academics and activists are gathering here this week to celebrate the anniversary of the landmark Earth Summit of 1992 and to try to address the linked problems of poverty, hunger, energy shortages and environmental degradation.
But the conference -- expected to draw as many as 50,000 participants -- is in many ways overshadowed by economic and political crises around the world. While more than 100 heads of state and government are planning to attend the formal talks starting Wednesday, President Obama, Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany are staying away, preoccupied by domestic politics and the financial turmoil in Europe. 
As a result, while diplomats feverishly negotiate a complex 80-page document spelling out the meeting's goals, there are few expectations for concrete actions or pledges of new aid to developing countries. Delegates said the constraints of the still-faltering global economy had dampened hopes and refueled the conflicts between industrialized and developing countries that have hobbled international development and environment talks for years.
Nick Robins, an analyst at HSBC, the international bank based in London, said that companies and financial institutions that support international development projects had hoped to see the conference produce an approach that would increase the flow of funds to the developing world. So far, he has been disappointed.
''What began as a mixed bag of proposals has, however, ballooned into a baggy and fractious document that mostly 'reaffirms' past commitments and 'acknowledges' problems, but marks precious little forward movement,'' Mr. Robins said in a research note published last week.
The conference is formally titled the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, but is more popularly known as Rio+20 because it commemorates the 20th anniversary of the Earth Summit here that produced a global treaty on climate change and an agreement to protect biodiversity. The two accords have sweeping ambitions, but have yielded only modest results so far.
Representatives are trying to tackle big questions such as protecting the world's forests and fisheries, bringing electricity to the more than one billion people who lack access to it, weaning the world off fossil fuels and encouraging farming and economic growth that do not destroy the natural environment.
Todd Stern, the United States' special envoy for climate change and the lead negotiator at the talks here, said that the Rio conference brought together the critical players who could broaden the discussion beyond the rich country-poor country dialogue that had grown tedious.
''The tough economic situation globally has an impact on government budgets and the capacity of traditional donor countries to provide traditional assistance, but we shouldn't overemphasize that constraint as other powerful factors are in play now,'' he said in an e-mail. ''Official development assistance represents only 13 percent of capital flows to developing countries today, compared to 70 percent in the 1960s, and that's because of the growing role of the private sector, trade, remittances and the like.''
Jeffrey Sachs, director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University, said the timing of the conference was unfortunate.
''Europe has been the great leader of environmental action,'' Mr. Sachs said in an interview here, ''but Europe is hardly functioning right now.''
For Brazil, hosting the conference creates an opportunity to project influence into different parts of the developing world. For instance, Brazil is sending Embraer jets to transport the delegations from 10 countries in Africa and the Caribbean, including Malawi, Sierra Leone, Dominica and Grenada.
The gesture speaks to Brazil's emergence as a financial powerhouse in Latin America, in stark contrast to the economic situation during the first Earth Summit, when Brazil was still struggling with galloping inflation and economic instability.
While the growth of the Brazilian economy has recently slowed, along with that of other big developing countries, like China and India, President Dilma Rousseff has found herself in the position of defending her government's development model, which involves the assertive use of state-controlled companies and banks to advance antipoverty projects.
''It's possible to have a country that develops economically, with growth and inclusion of its population, while also respecting the environment,'' Ms. Rousseff said in an address last week.
Brazilian diplomats have staked out an assertive role in preliminary talks, resisting proposals from rich industrialized countries that developing nations should be required to pay more to reduce environmental degradation.
William K. Reilly, who as head of the Environmental Protection Agency led the American delegation to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, said in an interview that he expected many of the delegates to the convention this year to criticize President Obama's decision not to attend, sending Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in his place. But Mr. Reilly said it was untenable for Mr. Obama to go, because he had no financial resources to offer and because he would face substantial criticism at home for seeming to be more concerned with global problems than domestic issues.
President George Bush faced similar criticism in 1992, and decided to go over the objections of his political advisers. Mr. Bush lost the election that year to Bill Clinton.
''The international community is going to have to learn never to hold a big global conference during an American presidential election year,'' Mr. Reilly said.

HEADLINE: The Great Divide Between the Parties

 BODY:
To the Editor:
David Brooks argues, in answer to Democrats who frequently ask him why Republicans have become so extreme, that Republicans are not extreme but rather ''have a viewpoint'' (''What Republicans Think,'' column, June 15). He then cogently describes the differences between Democrats and Republicans in how they see the problems we face.
What he says, however, has nothing whatsoever to do with what makes Democrats ask him why Republicans have become so extreme. That is caused by Republicans in the House voting to gut the Clean Air Act and the Clean Drinking Water Act, by Republicans attacking women's right to birth control, by Republicans refusing to pass the normally overwhelmingly bipartisan transportation bill and by the Republicans' single-minded focus on pushing more and more money to the most wealthy (this is just a partial list). 
It has been noted by many Republicans that Ronald Reagan would be too liberal for the Republican Party today.
There are legitimate differences between Republicans and Democrats about the role of government and how best to move America forward, but those differences have always existed and Democrats have not viewed Republicans as a group as extreme.
What we're dealing with now is altogether different; pretending it's just a different viewpoint is disingenuous at best and simply wrong.
RUSSELL SCHWARTZ Los Angeles, June 15, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks keeps coming up with elaborate ways to disguise the takeover of the Republican Party by the megawealthy. If the economic order of the second half of the 20th century is not coming back, it is because of Republican tax cuts to shift more wealth to the wealthy and squeeze the middle class.
As for comparisons with Europe's ''cosseted economies,'' why cherry-pick basket cases? Some European countries with welfare states relatively much bigger than ours have been doing quite well compared with the rest of the developed world. Look at Scandinavia and Austria.
So, no, keeping and ''rebalancing'' a social and economic model based on public investment and progressive tax rates won't turn us into Greece or Spain. Though perhaps, looking north in Europe, the lesson is that we should be investing more in our public sector and social supports, not less.
PAUL EPSTEIN New York, June 15, 2012
To the Editor:
David Brooks argues that the source of G.O.P. extremism is a conviction that ''the government model is obsolete.'' The Republicans I know didn't seem particularly bothered by the model during the 1990s, when a Democratic president occupied the White House, the economy was booming and productivity soared.
The context for the current wave of extremism, of course, is the severe recession brought on by the financial crisis of 2008-2009. But the ''welfare-state model'' wasn't responsible for the steep downturn. Instead, it was a brand of capitalism that seemed to have run amok -- one that allowed investment banks to make risky bets they ultimately lost and that caused nearly everyone to suffer the consequences.
In the eyes of many Democrats, Mitt Romney hardly represents ''comprehensive systemic change.'' He embodies a return to a style of governance that preaches greater efficiency, responsibility and fairness but practices the opposite. That's what the 2012 election is all about.

HEADLINE: Egypt's Democracy Interrupted

 BODY:
The once-promising democratic transition in Egypt is in peril after a power grab by the generals and the courts -- holdovers from Hosni Mubarak's repressive regime. This is not what Egyptians rallied and died for in Tahrir Square. It guarantees more turmoil. Given Egypt's importance in the Arab world, it sets a terrible example for other societies trying to get beyond autocratic rule. 
After Mr. Mubarak was deposed 16 months ago, the generals promised to transfer power to a civilian government by July 1. We were always skeptical, and they have now shown their true colors. On Wednesday, the ruling military council reimposed martial law two weeks after it expired. The following day, a panel of Mubarak-era judges ordered the dissolution of the newly elected Parliament, where the once-banned Muslim Brotherhood held a large majority. The generals quickly carried out the court order and claimed all legislative powers for themselves.
Then, on Sunday, the generals issued an interim constitution that removed the military and the defense minister from presidential oversight and named a 100-member panel to draft a new permanent charter, replacing one appointed by Parliament.
On Monday, as unofficial results suggested that Mohamed Morsi, the Muslim Brotherhood candidate, had defeated Ahmed Shafik, a former Air Force general and Mr. Mubarak's last prime minister, the generals were trying to calm things down, insisting Egyptians should ''trust the armed forces.'' It will take a lot more than words to get democracy back on track.
Egyptians wanted real change. In the first round of presidential voting, two moderate candidates together got the most votes, but they didn't make it into the final round. There are serious questions about Mr. Morsi's and Mr. Shafik's commitment to the economic and political reforms that Egypt desperately needs. After trying to cultivate an image of moderation, the Brotherhood allied itself with the hard-line Salafis and joined in their calls for the implementation of Islamic law. But if Mr. Morsi is indeed the winner, he must be allowed to do the job.
Egyptians made their revolution and ultimately must make it succeed. The reformers are going to have to regroup. They will be stronger if they work together.
And they will be stronger if they have less equivocal backing from the Obama administration, which was quiet for too long. It sent the wrong message in March when it resumed military aid to Egypt -- $1.3 billion annually -- after a five-month hiatus, even though the generals had not repealed the emergency law or dropped prosecutions against employees of four American-financed democracy groups. The administration should have delayed some of the aid to show firm support for the democratic process.
American officials were right to warn the generals on Monday that they risk losing billions of dollars if they don't swiftly transfer power to the president, ensure elections for a new Parliament and begin writing a new constitution with help from a broad range of Egyptians. The United States needs to work with Egypt to maintain the peace treaty and a stable border with Israel. But an undemocratic Egypt in perpetual turmoil is no help to its own people or Israel or the rest of the region.

HEADLINE: Obama and Putin Meet at Last, but Deadlock on Syria Strategy

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER

 BODY:
SAN JOSE DEL CABO, Mexico -- President Obama and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir V. Putin, finally had their face-to-face meeting on Monday, as Mr. Obama pressed Mr. Putin to work with him to ease President Bashar al-Assad of Syria out of power, a move increasingly viewed by the West as the only way to end the bloodshed that has been under way there for more than a year.
But after two full hours together, Mr. Putin was still balking, appearing afterward with Mr. Obama before reporters in a grim tableau that seemed to bespeak the frustration on both sides. During the few minutes that it took their handlers to usher reporters out of the room after their prepared remarks, the two leaders remained seated, side by side, staring straight ahead, with none of the interaction or small talk that leaders usually engage in before the cameras. ''We agreed that we need to see a cessation of the violence, that a political process has to be created to prevent civil war,'' Mr. Obama said. 
During the meeting, American officials said, Mr. Putin spent considerable time pointing to what the Russians view as failed examples of political transition in Egypt and Libya as well as their concern that the West does not have a credible plan for what would happen to Syria's various battling factions and ethnic groups if Mr. Assad stepped down from power.
Mr. Obama made a long and detailed effort to reassure Mr. Putin that the United States does not want to come between Russia and Syria, a strategic ally that Russia views as its last real bastion of influence in the region, the officials said. The Americans acknowledged that Russian officials have not really believed them when they have made these assurances in the past; Monday's meeting, they said, provided Mr. Obama the chance to try to make this case personally to Mr. Putin.
''We have found many common points on this issue,'' Mr. Putin allowed in his own remarks after the meeting, adding that the two countries would continue discussions.
Mr. Obama described the meeting -- rescheduled for this gathering of Group of 20 leaders after Mr. Putin canceled his trip to an economic summit meeting Mr. Obama held at Camp David last month -- as ''candid, thoughtful and thorough.''
But American officials did not try hard to paint the meeting between the men as full of bonhomie and good cheer. ''I thought the chemistry was very businesslike, cordial,'' Michael McFaul, the United States ambassador to Russia, told reporters in an effort to push back against any negative impressions the body language between the two presidents might have suggested. ''There was nothing extraordinary'' about Mr. Putin's dour demeanor, Mr. McFaul said. ''That's the way he looks, that's the way he acts.''
Now that Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin have gotten this first meeting out of the way and listened to each other's explanation for why Mr. Assad should, or should not, be pushed aside in Syria, United States officials say they hope they will be able to move forward.
''I think there was agreement that there needs to be a political process, that it cannot be just a cease-fire,'' said Benjamin Rhodes, the director for strategic communications with the National Security Council. ''Obviously the United States believes that political process needs to include Bashar al-Assad stepping down from power.''
Also on the agenda for Mr. Obama and Mr. Putin was the effort by the United States and Russia, along with Europe and China, to rein in Iran's nuclear ambitions. Even as they were meeting on the outskirts of a world economic summit gathering here in Mexico, tough talks on Iran's nuclear program were under way in Moscow. Mr. Obama said he and Mr. Putin had ''emphasized our shared approach'' and agreed that there was still time for diplomacy to work.
Mr. Obama's attempt to reset relations with Russia had begun with Mr. Putin's predecessor, Dmitri A. Medvedev, who only two and a half months ago said that ''these were perhaps the best three years of relations between Russia and the United States over the last decade.''
But this first meeting between these outsize personalities as leaders of their respective countries could not have come at a more fraught time. Russia and the United States are clashing over a series of difficult issues: the American deployment of a missile defense system that Mr. Putin considers a threat; pending legislation in Congress that blocks visas and freezes assets of Russian officials linked to human rights abuses; and statements from the State Department about the protests that greeted Mr. Putin's inauguration that left the Russian leader fuming.
But the biggest irritant of all right now is Syria, a longtime ally whose leader Russia has continued to defend in the face of condemnation from the West over Mr. Assad's bloody crackdown on protesters who support democracy. Russia has opposed Western intervention and, by some accounts, continues to arm Mr. Assad's forces. On Saturday, the United Nations suspended its observer mission in Syria because of the escalating violence. The move was widely viewed as an attempt to press Russia to intervene to assure that the observers are not targeted by Syrian forces or their sympathizers.
The renewed tensions come as the United States is heavily dependent on Russian cooperation for its military operations in Afghanistan. With Pakistan cutting off supply lines to Afghanistan, the so-called northern distribution network through Russia is the primary reinforcement route for America's war on the Taliban.
That all of this is happening in the middle of an election campaign is not lost on the White House, especially given the recent assertion by Mitt Romney, Mr. Obama's Republican opponent, that Russia is America's biggest strategic threat. The comments were widely ridiculed in foreign policy circles but nonetheless felt in Moscow.
The Obama administration dismissed Mr. Romney's remarks as election-year posturing, but given that they came just as Mr. Putin has been doing some muscle-flexing of his own, it has put Mr. Obama in a difficult position as he tries to persuade Mr. Putin of America's good intentions -- or, at least, its lack of ill intentions -- toward Russia.

HEADLINE: His Domain Transformed, Parks Chief Is Leaving

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO and WINNIE HU; David W. Chen contributed reporting.

 BODY:
He got his start as a teenager cleaning locker rooms at a city pool in the East Village and picking up litter in East River Park, and ended up overseeing the most ambitious program of building and refurbishing New York City's parks since the era of Robert Moses. Now, after a decade on the job, the parks commissioner, Adrian Benepe, 55, is stepping down to take a position with a national conservation group.
Mr. Benepe was 16 when he first worked for the Department of Parks and Recreation as a seasonal employee while still in high school. That was in summer 1973, ''when things were at a very low ebb,'' he said, referring to the poor condition of the city's parks. 
''It was a very dispiriting introduction,'' he continued.
Still, several years later, fresh out of Middlebury College, he took a job as an urban park ranger in Central Park, on the eve of the gradual but complete transformation of the city's flagship park. Over the next three decades, with some minor interruptions, Mr. Benepe climbed the ranks of the department, heading up communications, natural resources, art and antiquities and eventually becoming the Manhattan borough commissioner.
After Labor Day, Mr. Benepe will leave the parks department to take on a newly created position focusing on urban park development at the Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit group based in San Francisco. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg made the announcement at Soundview Park in the Bronx, where officials broke ground on more than $15 million in improvements, including a new track and field, playground, sports court and amphitheater.
Mr. Bloomberg said he was appointing Veronica M. White, the executive director of the city's Center for Economic Opportunity, a laboratory for some of the mayor's antipoverty initiatives, to succeed Mr. Benepe.
Named commissioner in 2002, Mr. Benepe was one of Mr. Bloomberg's original appointees and directed the department of 7,000 employees at a time of remarkable expansion and improvement of city parks. Aided by a strong economy for most of his tenure, as well as the mayor's own personal interest in public spaces, Commissioner Benepe presided over public-private partnerships that breathed life into several signature parks that are still works in progress, including the High Line and Brooklyn Bridge Park.
Other, less flashy spaces also reaped the benefits of the giant capital budget that the Bloomberg administration devoted to creating new parks -- 730 acres-worth to date -- and refurbishing existing ones. Of $4.5 billion budgeted for that purpose, $3 billion has already been spent.
''Some of the building under Adrian's tenure is nothing short of the time of Robert Moses,'' said Douglas Blonsky, president of the Central Park Conservancy, the nonprofit group that manages that park for the city. ''I think people don't realize that over the last 12 years we've seen new parks sprout up, and it's continuing. He's a real park professional.''
Mr. Bloomberg said Mr. Benepe did ''extraordinary work as parks commissioner, leading transformative changes in every corner of New York City.''
At the Trust for Public Land, Mr. Benepe will promote the public-private partnership model, an environmentally minded infrastructure and wider access to parks to cities across the country.
Ms. White's work at the economic opportunity center has followed the same mold. Mr. Bloomberg praised her record of ''exploring innovative partnerships and attracting private funds,'' skills that should serve her well as parks commissioner.
Mr. Benepe's two brief detours from the city's park system were both with like-minded organizations. For three years, he worked at the New York Botanical Garden and, with a colleague, hatched the idea for a winter railway show that became an annual holiday tradition for thousands of families. Later, at the Municipal Art Society, he began a popular exhibition aimed at children, called Kid City.
With two grown children, Mr. Benepe cited his interactions with young people, along with the chance to spend time outdoors, as one of the most appealing parts of his position. ''This job in particular is about the happy aspect of people's lives,'' he said.
Yet Mr. Benepe was not without critics. Some people objected to his turning to private sources for the money to pay for park maintenance, like the plan for upscale housing to underwrite Brooklyn Bridge Park and the twice-yearly fashion shows that take over Damrosch Park next to Lincoln Center.
Mr. Benepe also clashed with vendors and artists over the city's efforts to rein in commerce in parks. And there have been complaints that the upkeep of the city's many existing parks has been sacrificed for lavish expenditures on a few new gems.
''We're classic victims of our own success,'' said Holly M. Leicht, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks, an advocacy group. ''All the attention paid to the beautiful new parks has created a certain complacency about the state of the existing parks. There's a disconnect between the capital investments and the depletion of the maintenance budgets.''
Still, Ms. Leicht lauded what she called the innovative funding structures, especially for waterfront parks where piers are constantly eroded by marine organisms and wave action. ''If we want new parkland, we do need to think creatively and this administration, with Adrian Benepe as commissioner, has been willing to push the envelope on some of those alternate financing mechanisms,'' she said. ''That's the wave of the future.''
Mr. Benepe said New York had become a city known for its parks, in part because of large networks of volunteers and in part because of philanthropy -- some $165 million raised privately each year through several nonprofit groups, including Friends of the High Line, the City Parks Foundation and the Central Park Conservancy.
''Generous philanthropists, committed volunteers and city largess -- you put the three of those together and it becomes this very creative laboratory,'' he said. ''That itself is not replicable, but some of the lessons learned are replicable. What separates a great city from an O.K. city are great parks and public spaces.''

HEADLINE: Rio Isn't All Lost

BYLINE: By CHRISTIAN AZAR, THOMAS STERNER and GERNOT WAGNER. 
Christian Azar is a professor of energy and the environment at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden. Thomas Sterner is a visiting chief economist at the Environmental Defense Fund. Gernot Wagner, an economist at the Environmental Defense Fund, is the author of ''But Will the Planet Notice?''

 BODY:
IN June 1992, world leaders, including President George Bush, agreed to combat climate change at the Earth Summit meeting in Rio de Janeiro. This week, at ''Rio+20,'' leaders, experts and activists will once more gather to ponder the fate of the planet.
Optimism will be in short supply. Since the first conference, global carbon emissions have increased by some 50 percent -- an outcome that those who were present 20 years ago would surely have seen as disastrous. And we are continuing this sorry trend: As the Arctic becomes ice-free, we can expect that it will be drilled for oil. 
But below most radars, and despite the alarming news, the seeds of an energy revolution are being sown. Given some luck and the right policies, that revolution could yet help us resolve the climate crisis.
Solar and wind energy are developing faster than predicted -- indeed, faster than most people realize. Europe is showing the way. Denmark gets about 20 percent of its electricity from wind. On a nice day, Germany, which no one thinks of as a sunny place, gets from the sun over 40 percent of the electricity it uses.
Worldwide, solar and wind capacity now tops 300 gigawatts, three times as much as the total capacity in Britain, or roughly as much electricity as 50 nuclear reactors, nearly half the number now operating in the United States. Most of this renewable capacity has been installed in just the last five years. In fact, over that period, solar capacity has been growing by over 50 percent a year, wind by 25 percent.
As these markets grow, costs are plunging. The cost of photovoltaic cells has fallen by two-thirds in three years. Today, solar energy costs around 15 cents a kilowatt-hour in the United States. In some regions, like Southern California, the cost of solar power is nearly on par with what consumers pay for electricity now.
To be sure, this sunny picture does not diminish the magnitude of the challenge. In absolute terms, fossil fuels are growing faster than renewables, and global greenhouse gas emissions are still rising. In addition, governments continue to provide hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies to the fossil fuel industry.
It won't be easy for the world to kick its addiction to fossil fuels, but it is doable. First and foremost, we need to put a price or cap on carbon emissions. Every ton of coal, every barrel of oil does more in socialized damage to economies, health and ecosystems than it adds in value to overall economic output. That cost in simple fairness ought to be reflected in the price of the fuels themselves. Otherwise, the oil and coal and power companies are simply leaving the tab for adverse consequences -- from bad health to coastal flooding -- to be picked up by everyone else.
Second, we need direct support for research, development and deployment of renewable technologies. Installing the first solar panel is more expensive than the one-millionth. That cries out for a temporary subsidy. Governments will not always back the right horses, but we know what direction the horses need to run in. We need to jump-start the race.
On top of that, we ought to make government rules a catalyst -- rather than an obstacle -- for private investment. That goes for everything from zoning to home mortgages. Putting a solar panel on your roof ought to allow you to sell electricity to the grid.
This two-pronged policy approach is not some pie-in-the-sky idea. The European Union already has a cap on carbon pollution and is directly supporting the deployment of solar and wind technologies. China, which has aggressively supported its renewable-energy industries, is also implementing cap-and-trade systems in seven regions and cities, including Beijing. India is pursuing utility-scale solar installations and has a coal tax raising $500 million a year. Australia's government has put a price on carbon. South Korea has instituted a direct carbon cap. And California is readying America's first comprehensive cap-and-trade system to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, combined with direct subsidies like its successful Solar Initiative.
None of these policies are sufficient by themselves. But all are pointing in the right direction. As Thomas Edison said almost a century ago: ''I'd put my money on the sun and solar energy. What a source of power! I hope we don't have to wait until oil and coal run out before we tackle that.''
The solar and wind revolution is just beginning. But with determination and the right policies, by the time Rio+30 rolls around, optimism might be the order of the day.

HEADLINE: Interest Rates: Varieties of Error

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Crowding out versus solvency. 

 BODY:
I wrote recently about how the failure of inflation to soar was one of the three key tests that classical economics, in all its forms, failed in this depression, while Keynesian economics succeeded. A second was the effect of austerity; Jared Bernstein points us to one of the many charts, this time from Jay Shambaugh, showing that euro experience looks awfully Keynesian:
The last point is interest rates. But I constantly encounter people claiming that high bond prices and hence low interest rates are just a bubble. I don't think so, but even aside from that, this claim misses a key point about the original nature of the argument.
Originally, claims that deficits would drive up rates weren't based on arguments about solvency; they were based on the "crowding out" claim that the government would be competing with the private sector for a limited supply of savings. Then, when the promised rate spike failed to materialize, this was attributed to Fed purchases, with the claim that rates would spike when those came to an end. Wrong, and wrong again. As I wrote at the time, all this represented a basic misunderstanding of how the economy works.
Now, maybe there's a solvency issue, and bond vigilantes will turn on America over that -- although of course this keeps not happening either to us or to anyone else with their own currency. But you do need to know that many of the people making the solvency argument originally made a completely different argument -- one that was completely wrong.

HEADLINE: Mark Ruffalo Joins Call for a Tax on Wall Street

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The actor Mark Ruffalo, who fights alien invaders in "The Avengers," takes on Wall Street earthlings in a new video, calling for a tax on financial transactions. 

 BODY:
The push to tax Wall Street is getting some star power.
The actor Mark Ruffalo, who fights alien invaders in "The Avengers," takes on Wall Street earthlings in a new video calling for a tax on financial transactions.
The video, financed by several advocacy groups, supports a proposed "Robin Hood tax," a levy of less than half of 1 percent on every Wall Street trade, being billed as a way to raise hundreds of billions of dollars to help reduce the federal deficit. The video's release on Tuesday coincides with a series of demonstrations in cities like New York and Washington.
"The idea has been around a long time, but the time has really arrived to put it in place," the Columbia economist Jeffrey D. Sachs says in a segment in the video.
Mr. Ruffalo, who also is an advocate for environmental causes, opens the video by altering a dollar bill, drawing a Robin Hood cap and mask on the face of George Washington, as a symbol for the campaign. Chris Martin, the singer of Coldplay, and Tom Morello, of Rage Against the Machine, also make appearances.
The movement has drawn some support from financial circles. Wallace C. Turbeville, a former Goldman Sachs banker who now is a senior fellow at Demos, a public policy research organization in New York, submitted testimony last month for the Senate Banking Committee in favor of more banking regulation.
Mr. Turbeville, who oversaw an infrastructure and energy finance group at Goldman in London in the 1990s, said on Tuesday that a tax on financial transactions could serve a dual role, raising revenue for the government while reining in risky financial behavior. Such limits are especially important in the aftermath of JPMorgan Chase's trading debacle, he said.
"A lot of activities in the financial services industry just can't be regulated well by things like measuring what the potential consequences are and reserving against them, largely because they are very difficult to measure," he said. "So limiting activities is actually quite essential."

HEADLINE: Gael Greene Is Fired by Crain's

BYLINE: CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY


HIGHLIGHT: Crain's New York Business will no longer publish columns by Gael Greene, the former restaurant reviewer for New York magazine. 

 BODY:
Gael Greene (right), the restaurant critic dismissed after a 40-year career at New York magazine, is facing unemployment again. She will no longer contribute to Crain's New York Business.
"Am I the oldest person in the world to be fired twice mid-forkful in less than four years?" she wrote on her blog, Insatiable Critic, and posted on Twitter.
Word that Ms. Greene had been let go spread quickly in the social media world. Followers sent her notes of support and tweets that her work would be missed.
Ms. Greene had been working for Crain's since 2008, the year she was dismissed from New York magazine. Glenn Coleman, Crain's New York Business editor, said that he liked Ms. Greene's work, but that the magazine had been working on a redesign it plans to unveil in its Monday issue. When he got approval for the redesign today, he let Ms. Greene know he would no longer need her musings on food.
"Her last column has run, and Gael knows the ends of the term of her agreement and I believe she is quite satisfied about it," Mr. Coleman said. "She's a lovely writer. She's got a wonderful mind, a great voice. The idea of the restaurant review, whether it's by Gael Greene or anyone else, is not what I want." 
Ms. Greene seemed surprised by the news. She wrote on her blog that she had just rejected an offer for a free dinner on Monday night because she assumed Crain's would cover the cost, "so that I could maintain my professional integrity."
She wrote: "Sob. Well, now I'm free for long vacations and all those assignments I've been turning away."

HEADLINE: The World Is Fat (Especially America)

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The world could stand to shed a few pounds. Fifteen million metric tons, actually, a new study estimates. 

 BODY:
The world could stand to shed a few pounds. Fifteen million metric tons, in fact, according to a new study.
In the study, published in the open-access journal BMC Public Health, researchers used country-specific data on body mass index and heights to estimate the biomass of the world's entire adult population.
They concluded that in 2005, the global adult human biomass was about 287 million metric tons. (A metric ton is 1,000 kilograms, or about 2,200 pounds.) About 15 million metric tons of that biomass were the extra pounds of people who were overweight (here defined as having a body mass index value above 25). About 3.5 million metric tons of that total biomass were because of obesity (having a B.M.I. above 30).
The United States is to blame for a lot of those spare tires. While America holds about 5 percent of the world's adult population, it accounts for about a third of the excess weight because of obesity.
Japan and the United States in particular demonstrate the extreme variations in weight. Both are rich countries, but the American population is one of the most overweight in the world and Japan's is one of the leanest. The average B.M.I. in Japan in 2005 was 22.9, and in the United States it was 28.7.
If all countries had the same B.M.I. distribution as Japan, the world's total biomass would fall by 14.6 million metric tons, or 5 percent.
If, on the other hand, all countries were about as overweight as the United States, total biomass across the globe would increase by 58 million metric tons, or about 20 percent.
These numbers matter not only because of the health concerns over obesity. They matter also because of the energy required to feed people who are obese. Malthus worried about the sustainability of population growth; this study's authors worry about the sustainability of population girth.
"When people think about environmental sustainability, they immediately focus on population," one of the paper's authors, Ian Roberts,told the BBC. "Actually, when it comes down to it, it's not how many mouths there are to feed. It is how much flesh there is on the planet."
To get a sense of scale, here is a chart showing how many kilocalories a day were required per person in 2005, from a selection of countries:
If all countries were as fat as the United States, the resulting increase in global weight would increase energy requirements by 261 kilocalories a day per adult. That's the same as adding the energy requirements of 473 million adults of average B.M.I. to the planet.
"Tackling population fatness may be critical to world food security and ecological sustainability," the authors conclude.
Some caveats: The authors note that the data available to estimate biomass is spotty, so they made some debatable assumptions. For example, they assumed that the B.M.I.'s within each country followed a normal distribution. Their estimates for calories required to maintain a given weight also do not reflect different amounts of physical labor typical in different countries.

HEADLINE: Julius Baer in Talks to Buy Bank of America Unit

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: A deal for the international wealth management business of Bank of America Merrill Lynch would help the Swiss firm diversify at a time when local regulators are putting pressure on the country's financial institutions. 

 BODY:
The Swiss bank Julius Baer is in talks to acquire the international wealth management business of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
The deal, which is at an early stage, would help the Swiss firm to diversify from its home market at a time when local regulators are putting pressure on the country's financial institutions.
Julius Baer did not disclose the size of the deal, but analysts said the transaction could be valued up to $2.5 billion. A representative for the Swiss bank was not immediately available for comment.
Despite Europe's financial crisis, the Swiss bank has been actively looking to diversify into new markets. In 2010, Julius Baer acquired the European wealth management business of the Dutch firm ING for $506 million.
The expansion comes as regulators worldwide are increasing pressure on private banks and other money managers to be more transparent in their dealings with clients. Julius Baer is one of 11 Swiss banks currently under investigation by U.S. authorities for allegedly helping Americans to evade taxes.
The acquisition would give Julius Baer control of Bank of America's non-U.S. wealth management unit, which currently has around $90 billion of assets under management. The business had been put up for sale earlier this year.
The transaction represents one of the largest deals in the wealth management industry since 2010. It also would be the first for Julius Baer since the Swiss bank was outbid for majority control of the private bank Sarasin last year. The Brazilian-Swiss firm Safra entirely acquired Sarasin for $1.1 billion.
Bank of America's international wealth management unit has operations across Europe, the Middle East and the Asian pacific region. By acquiring the unit, Julius Baer will increase its assets under management by nearly 50 percent, to approximately $276 billion.

HEADLINE: Ryanair Offers $883 Million for Aer Lingus

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The European low cost airline Ryanair on Tuesday offered 694 million euros ($883 million) to buy the Irish carrier Aer Lingus, the latest in a number of deals in the fast-consolidating airline industry. 

 BODY:
LONDON -- The European low cost airline Ryanair offered 694 million euros ($883 million) to buy the Irish carrier Aer Lingus, the latest in a number of deals in the fast-consolidating airline industry.
Ryanair, which already owns a 29.8 percent stake in Aer Lingus, said on Tuesday that it had bid 1.30 euros ($1.64)for each share in the carrier. The offer represents a 38 percent premium on Aer Lingus' closing share price on Tuesday.
The announcement comes a day after Britain's antitrust regulator said it would investigate Ryanair's minority stake in Aer Lingus. Concerns has been raised that the low cost carrier's share ownership could stifle competition.
Faced with continued high oil prices and a reduction in consumer spending, Western airlines have been striking deals in a bid to remain profitable.
International Airlines Group, the parent company of British Airways and the Spanish carrier Iberia, agreed last year to buy British Midland International from Lufthansa of Germany. US Airways also has been considering a merger with AMR Corp., the bankrupt parent of American Airlines.
Ryanair, which made an unsuccessful takeover approach for Aer Lingus in 2006, said its new bid would help the carriers compete with larger rivals.
"This offer represents a significant opportunity to combine Aer Lingus with Ryanair to form one strong Irish airline group capable of competing with Europe's other major airline groups," Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, said in a statement.
A potential deal for Aer Lingus may face tough opposition from antitrust authorities, which blocked Ryanair's previous bid for the Irish carrier.
The Irish government retains a 25 percent stake in Aer Lingus, but plans to sell its shares as part of the bailout it received from the International Monetary Fund and the European Union. Etihad Airways also holds around a 3 percent stake in the Irish carrier.
Ryanair said it would be willing to work with an investor, such as Etihad Airways, that may acquire the government's stake in Aer Lingus. The low cost carrier also said it would be open to selling its stake in Aer Lingus to the investor if both sides could agree on a price.
A representative for Aer Lingus was not immediately available for comment.
Davy Corporate Finance and Morgan Stanley are advising Ryanair.

HEADLINE: What Obama's Immigration Decision Might Mean for 2012

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: If Mitt Romney moves closer to a lukewarm acquiescence of President Obama's decision, he may be accused of flip-flopping. But candidates flip-flop when they conclude that the alternative might be more costly. 

 BODY:
Even in an era where partisanship is on the rise, demographic changes exert a gravitational pull on policy and politics and are occasionally enough to overcome political divisions. What is more remarkable than President Obama's decision on Friday to suspend deportations of some illegal immigrants is Republicans' relatively passive reaction to it.
Although some Republicans, like Rick Santorum and Alberto Gonzales, have denounced Mr. Obama's decision, others have had a more equivocal response - unusually so in an election year in which both parties have responded to the smallest gaffe or the slightest opening with jaded and hyperbolic critiques.
A few influential Republicans, like William Kristol, have praised Mr. Obama's decision outright. Others like Marco Rubio have pushed back on the circumstances of the decision, but less so its substance.
The presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, has so far taken an ambiguous standon Mr. Obama's decision, largely avoiding questions about it. This is despite Mr. Romney having run to the right of his Republican adversaries on immigration during the primaries, often having used the issue to assert his conservative credentials.
If Mr. Romney eventually comes closer to a lukewarm acquiescence of Mr. Obama's decision, he may be accused of flip-flopping. But candidates sometimes flip-flop when they conclude that the alternative might be more costly.
In the years leading up to the 2008 presidential election and the months immediately following it, a number of mostly liberal-leaning scholars proposed a theory called the "emerging Democratic majority,"which pointed out that some groups that were more favorably inclined toward Democrats were becoming more plentiful as a share of the American population.
The theory relies heavily on Hispanic voters, who represented about 9 percent of voters in the 2008 election, according to exit polls. Hispanics represented just 2 percent of the turnout in the 1992 presidential election, but the percentage has risen slowly but steadily since then.
A critique of the theory, and one which I mostly find persuasive, is proposed in various forms by analysts like Sean Trende of Real Clear Politics and Jamelle Bouie of The American Prospect.
Mr. Trende and Mr. Bouie make a number of arguments, but a simple one is that "permanent" majorities are usually an illusion. Instead, demographic and cultural changes produce shifts in public opinion, and the parties respond to them by changing their positions accordingly, in such a way that they gravitate toward splitting the electorate about 50-50.
This may be an example of exactly the sort of adaptation that Mr. Trende and Mr. Bouie describe. Republicans, like any political party, are often guilty of prioritizing short-term tactical goals over long-term strategic ones. But many of them seem to see the writing on the wall on the immigration issue. The Republican nominees in 2000, 2004 and 2008, George W. Bush and John McCain, took relatively moderate stances on immigration, and it would not be surprising if Mr. Romney softened his position as well.
From 2009 to 2011, about 2 million people became naturalized citizens of the United States. Few of these new citizens (about 13 percent) represented demographic groups like Europeans or Canadians that would traditionally be considered white. Instead, about 40 percent came from Asia, and 35 percent came from Latin America.
It would be a mistake to conclude that Hispanic and Asian-American voters care solely about immigration, as news media accounts sometimes suggest. Instead, a survey in December by the Pew Hispanic Center found that only about one-third of Hispanic registered voters listed immigration as an extremely important issue, whereas close to 50 percent said the same of jobs, education and health care.
Still, most Latinos in the Pew survey had disapproved of Mr. Obama's handling of deportation policy, and most were aware that deportations had increased during Mr. Obama's time in office.
In the Pew survey and in others, Mr. Obama's approval ratings have not always been outstanding among Hispanic voters. But relatively few have said that they plan to vote for Mr. Romney. 
The danger for Democrats was that these voters, unenthusiastic about both choices, might not have turned out to vote at all. Historically, Hispanics have not been as likely to register to vote as other groups, in part a reflection of the fact that a fair number of them are not United States citizens. However, voting participation has been relatively low,even among those Hispanics who were registered to vote.
Mr. Obama's decision could motivate some additional turnout among these voters. If, for instance, Hispanic turnout increases by 5 percent, and 5 percent of Hispanics who might otherwise have voted for Mr. Romney now vote for Mr. Obama instead, it would swing a net of about 1 percentage point in support to Mr. Obama. That is hardly a game-changer, but it could matter in an election that could be very close.
If Mr. Romney treads softly on the issue, it may be to return the focus more to the economy. Many Hispanics were hit hard by the recession, and they are more of a swing vote than they are given credit for. The percentage of Hispanics voting for Democrats has varied in recent elections, from as low as 53 percent in 2004 to as high as 73 percent in 1996. A charge of flip-flopping on immigration policy might be the lesser of evils for Mr. Romney if he wants to maximize his competitiveness among these voters.

HEADLINE: It's V.P. Mentioning Season for the G.O.P.

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Which boring Midwestern conservative will Mitt Romney pick as his running mate? 

 BODY:
Who will be Mitt Romney's running mate? I can hardly wait to find out, and I'm sure you can't, either. Lots of names are getting tossed around, with the background encouragement of Mr. Romney's aides, who are trying hard to show that they're doing a better job of vetting candidates than Republican nominees generally do.
The campaign let reporters know - or at least think - that two people who appeared with Mr. Romney and traveled with him on his bus the other day - were trying out for the job.
One was Tim Pawlenty, the former governor of Minnesota, one of those stalwart and seemingly not crazy Midwesterners that Republicans like to consider for national office but never select. Mr. Pawlenty was on John McCain's mentioned-but-not-picked list, and will likely end up on Mr. Romney's mentioned-but-not-picked list. He would be a safe, but extremely dull choice.

The other was Rob Portman, who won a Senate seat in 2010 after representing the Cincinnati suburbs in the House for 12 years. He's another stalwart Midwestern conservative, and an early and loyal supporter of Mr. Romney. There's just one tiny problem: He was President George W. Bush's budget director from 2006 to 2007. Mr. Romney's economic program is basically just a rerun of Mr. Bush's deficit-exploding, market-imploding programs, but that's not the impression Mr. Romney is trying to give.
Another talked-about candidate is Paul Ryan, the right-wing Congressman and supposed deficit hawk whose draconian and dangerous budget Mr. Romney has endorsed. It's a horrible plan that would slash spending on social programs that Republicans like Mr. Ryan have always hated, in the name of balancing the budget. But it would also continue tax cuts for the rich that guarantee the budget won't balance.
I think Mr. Romney would be better off leaving Mr. Ryan where he is, in Congress, causing trouble for the Democrats.
Marco Rubio, the charming senator from Florida, is sometimes mentioned for the VP slot. He's just come out with a memoir, which means nothing really, but is highly thought-of in a media-driven age. Here's an interesting quote from the book, "An American Son": "If my kids went to sleep hungry every night and my country didn't give me an opportunity to feed them, there isn't a law, no matter how restrictive, that would prevent me from coming here." That's just by the way. The Atlantic Wire, citing ABC news, says he's not being vetted, so he's an unlikely prospect. The article says the campaign mostly wants to use him to raise money among Hispanics.
The main thing, according to an article in The Times by Ashley Parker and Jeff Zeleny, is to make everyone understand that Mr. Romney is doing this very seriously. He's looking for someone who is actually ready to be president, rather than learning on the job. I think we all know what that means: .
The McCain campaign in 2008 sent out 80-page questionnaires before settling on Ms. Palin, who launched a 1,000 late-night jokes. She was the most ridiculous running mate in a long-string of bad Republican running mates.
George W. Bush picked Dick Cheney to run his vice presidential search, and after much effort and much searching, Mr. Cheney picked Mr. Cheney, who was in ill health, with a defibrillator implanted in his chest.
In 1996, Bob Dole searched far and wide and came up with Jack Kemp, who was supposed to lend a certain vigor - of the football locker room towel snapping variety - to the ticket. But nobody thought he should be president and in the end, very few people thought Bob Dole should be president, either.
In 1992, George H.W. Bush ran for re-election with Dan Quayle. I covered Mr. Quayle fairly extensively when I was a White House reporter. He was smarter than people gave him credit for, and very charming and affable. He was also a true social conservative. People laughed at his Murphy Brown speech, but it was the first shot in the family-values war. The problem as nobody, probably including Mr. Quayle, thought he should be president.
The good news for Mr. Romney? With this history, it's going be hard for him to do worse. Except that's what a lot of people thought in 2008, when Mr. McCain was in this same position.

HEADLINE: New Book Raises Questions About Obama's Memoir

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: A new book by a Washington Post reporter could raise further questions about how closely the President Obama's telling of his life hews to reality. 

 BODY:
At Harvard Law School in 1990, President Obama found himself lovingly mocked by his peers for relentlessly promoting the exotic story of a search for racial identity that later became the theme of his best-selling book, "Dreams From My Father."
"My mother was a backup singer for Abba. They were good folks," a student parody of Mr. Obama joked. In Chicago, "I discovered I was black, and I have remained so ever since."
A presidential election victory 18 years later ushered Mr. Obama into the White House. But it also drew new attention to the stories he told in the book, written years before his presidential campaign. And as he runs for office again, there are new questions about how closely the president's telling of his life hews to reality.
A new book by David Maraniss of The Washington Post claims to document the many ways - some very small, a few large - in which Mr. Obama's youthfully constructed narrative appears to be contradicted by the people and events in his life.
And the book, available Tuesday, follows reporting in The New York Times and elsewhere over the past half-dozen years that has sometimes called into question parts of Mr. Obama's life story.
The president's memoir has long been the foundation of Mr. Obama's political biography. In 2008, it was one of two books that delivered a defining and searing narrative around which the men running for president built their political brands.
"Dreams From My Father" portrayed Mr. Obama as a mixed-race young man raised without a father and struggling to find his racial identity. In "Faith of My Fathers," John McCain was a brash young soldier struggling to live up to his father, becoming a hero along the way.
Mr. Obama's memoir - written at a time that the young man contemplated a career as an author - later became a hit among Mr. Obama's political groupies, who sometimes arrived at campaign events in 2008 clutching copies.
But the questions about Mr. Obama's book highlight the potential downside for politicians who document their lives as a way of introducing themselves to the American public. The claims in those memoirs are immediately targets for the kind of scrutiny that only comes during the intensity of a political campaign. 
Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, is experiencing the phenomenon in hyper speed. His own autobiography is also available Tuesday, alongside a competing biography from a Washington Post reporter who dug up errors in the senator's stories about his Cuban parents.
The accuracy of Mr. Rubio's telling of his family history may be part of the calculation for Mitt Romney as the presumptive Republican nominee mulls whether to pick Mr. Rubio as his vice-presidential running mate.
But Mr. Obama has even more at stake as he returns to the campaign trail to ask for a second term in the White House. As Ben Smith of Buzzfeed.com noted over the weekend, the memoir was Mr. Obama's primary means of telling a "simple, and ultimately optimistic story about race and identity in the 20th Century."
Now, Republicans are poised to try and portray Mr. Obama as having been less than truthful in his recollections about his life. Party officials and aides to Mr. Romney's campaign are scouring Mr. Maraniss's book to find ways in which they can use it to their political advantage.
The new book by Mr. Maraniss suggests that the real story of Mr. Obama's life was less dramatic - and more routine - than the president made it out to be in the memoir. 
In an interview Tuesday morning on MSNBC's "Morning Joe" program, Mr. Maraniss said the president did not set out to write a factual history of his life and was "trying to see everything through a racial lens. That was the original purpose of that book." Mr. Maraniss added that "I don't think it's a venal reason. I think it says more about a writer's pressures to try to tell a story than anything about his larger character."
Mr. Maraniss attributes some of the differences to the kind of family lore that is often exaggerated. He notes that the story about the death of Mr. Obama's step-grandfather - allegedly killed while fighting Dutch troops in Indonesia - was "a concocted myth in almost all respects." Mr. Maraniss writes that he died trying to hang drapes.
In other cases, Mr. Maraniss writes that Mr. Obama skipped over the more mundane parts of his upbringing to focus on the themes of race. One example was the role of basketball in the life of the young Mr. Obama, experiences which "did not make his life odd or mysterious."
Mr. Obama was upfront in his memoir that dialogue in the book was "an approximation" and that some of the characters in his book had been compressed or combined. But the specifics had remained mostly unknown. In his book, Mr. Maraniss documents several of the efforts by Mr. Obama to invent or alter characters to help his narrative.
The most dramatic was that of Mr. Obama's New York girlfriend. In the book by Mr. Maraniss, the president acknowledges that some of the events he describes as taking place with the New York girlfriend actually took place with another woman he dated in Chicago.
"Like many characters in the memoir, he introduced her to advance a theme, another thread of thought in his musings about race," Mr. Maraniss writes in the book.
The book by Mr. Maraniss, who is also the author of a biography about Bill Clinton, is not the first effort by journalists to examine Mr. Obama's telling of his own life story.
In 2008, Serge Kovaleski, a New York Times reporter, interviewed friends of Mr. Obama's from college and high school who questioned the scenes in Mr. Obama's memoir about smoking marijuana and trying cocaine as a youth.
"Friends, classmates and mentors from his high school and Occidental recalled Mr. Obama as being grounded, motivated and poised, someone who did not appear to be grappling with any drug problems and seemed to dabble only with marijuana," Mr. Kovaleski wrote. 
Mr. Maraniss offers a third view, describing Mr. Obama as part of a "choom gang," a group of high school basketball buddies in Hawaii who frequently smoked marijuana.
Last year, a former New York Times reporter, Janny Scott, wrote a book that raised questions about Mr. Obama's frequently mentioned story about his mother's battles with insurance companies at the end of her life.
"I will never forget my own mother, as she fought cancer in her final months, having to worry about whether her insurance would refuse to pay for her treatment," Mr. Obama said in 2009, as he campaigned for passage of his health care program.
Ms. Scott's research suggested that Mr. Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, was covered by health insurance at the time, and was instead denied disability coverage that would have helped to pay expenses that were not covered by insurance.
Aides to Mr. Obama last year said the book confirmed the basic facts of the stories that the president told about his mother, including the health care expenses that she struggled to pay.
The campaign for president this year is unlikely to turn on questions about Mr. Obama's memoir. Both presidential campaigns have said they believe the American people are focused on the country's struggling economic fortunes.
But at the very least, the publication of Mr. Maraniss's book less than five months before election day suggests that the president will face more questions about his personal narrative than he did four years ago.

HEADLINE: Some Democrats Make Student Loans a Campaign Issue

BYLINE: REBECCA BERG


HIGHLIGHT: Both parties don't want the interest rates on school loans to rise, but they can't agree on where to find money to make that happen. 

 BODY:
With federal college loan rates set to double in less than two weeks unless Congress takes action, some Democrats are using the time until then to draw political capital from the hot-button issue. 
The government-funded Stafford loans that are in limbo currently have an interest rate of 3.4 percent; the rate is set to go to 6.8 percent on July 1. Although many Democrats and Republicans agree that the rate should remain where it is, the parties haven't been able to reach consensus about how to offset the cost. 
Republicans have proposed taking money from the health care law to that effect, in spite of warnings by President Obama that he would veto it. Democrats have proposed eliminating a loophole in Social Security and Medicare taxes for some high earners. Each side has accused the other of obstruction. 
With progress stalled on Capitol Hill, some Democratic candidates have, in the same vein as Mr. Obama, taken the fight to the campaign trail to raise money and curry favor with voters. 
Representative Tammy Baldwin, of Wisconsin, spoke about the issue at a stop in Madison, which is home to the University of Wisconsin's flagship campus. Representative John F. Tierney of Massachusetts, who sponsored a version of the college-loan legislation in the House, . And Paul Hirschbiel, a Democrat who is challenging Representative Scott Rigell in Virginia, appealed to supporters to "tell Congress to stop playing games with our children's future" by donating to his campaign. 
Republicans, meanwhile, have chided Democrats, saying that they defend the health care law at any cost. 
Andrea Bozek, a spokeswoman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, said the student-loan debate was an example of how policies backed by Democrats, like the health care overhaul, ultimately "have left college students with fewer job opportunities and more student loan debt." 
The underlying issue is not trivial: According to the most recent numbers released by the Department of Education, 46 percent of undergraduate students in the 2007-8 school year had at some point turned to the government for a college loan. More students are taking out loans, too: In 1989-90, just 27 percent of undergraduates borrowed money for school from the government.

HEADLINE: In Sign of Weak Economy, FedEx Predicts Slower Earnings

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
FedEx said Tuesday that slow global economic growth would weigh on its earnings over the next 12 months. The company vowed to make significant cost cuts to counter any drop in package shipments. 
The giant package delivery company is closely watched for signs about the health of the economy. It forecast moderate growth for both the American and global economies, citing the debt crisis in Europe and slowing growth in Asia.
Fedex's earnings for its fiscal fourth quarter did top Wall Street estimates when a charge for retiring planes was excluded.
But the Memphis-based company forecast earnings in its fiscal first quarter and for the year that fell below Wall Street's expectations. FedEx faces a number of obstacles, including higher salaries and pension costs, as well as a shift by customers to cheaper shipping options to save money.
The company predicts fiscal year 2013 earnings of $6.90 to $7.40 a share. That excludes the major cost reductions it plans to announce in the fall. Wall Street analysts expected earnings of $7.39 a share.
In a note to clients, Peter Nesvold, an analyst at Jefferies & Company, said that while the earnings forecast highlighted a weakening global economy, higher costs were the main reason FedEx fell short of Wall Street's expectations. He said that a reorganization in FedEx's Express unit in the United States, including possible job cuts, could increase earnings in the long run.
FedEx is calling for 2.2 percent economic growth in the United States this year -- higher than the 2.1 percent it predicted three months ago. It expects that to rise to 2.4 percent next year, about in line with the current consensus of economists.
In its most recent quarter, FedEx earned $550 million, or $1.73 a share, compared with $558 million, or $1.75 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $11 billion from $10.55 billion a year earlier. Without the charge to retire planes, FedEx earned $1.99 a share, 4 cents better than Wall Street estimates.
FedEx is getting rid of more aircraft to slim down its express network as more consumers choose slower shipping services to save money. Operating income in that unit fell 34 percent including the one-time charge, or 3 percent without it.
The company earned 6 percent more per package in its American unit despite a 5 percent decline in total shipments. It credited that to growth in its overnight service and higher customer charges for fuel. International priority shipment revenue rose 3 percent, while volume fell 3 percent as growth in Asia slowed.
Shares of FedEx rose $2.50, or 2.8 percent, to close at $91.01.

HEADLINE: Self-Interest Meets Mandate

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Within the next few days, the Supreme Court may strike down the provision in the Affordable Care Act requiring every American to buy health insurance. Odds that the justices will reject this measure, the so-called individual mandate, are approaching 80 percent on Intrade, a market where investors can bet on the outcome of pretty much everything.
What's harder to figure out is what will then happen to health insurance. Advocates of health care reform argue that eliminating the mandate could gut the president's plan. Most health economists would probably agree.
But this consensus is based on a fairly optimistic view that the individual mandate and accompanying fines for failing to comply will be highly effective at persuading Americans to buy health insurance that they would otherwise forgo. On that score, the mandate might matter less than its advocates believe. 
Ultimately, the answer will depend on Americans' behavior. Specifically, how far will we go for a free lunch?
The case for the individual mandate rests on the belief -- shared by most economists -- that most people go through life seeking the best possible deal, always looking to get the most out of any given situation.
The health care act requires insurers to charge everybody the same rates regardless of their health status. Healthy Americans could save money by dropping their insurance until they were sick.
Think of a world in which people bought car insurance only when their car was lying crumpled in a ditch after an accident and you'll understand why an insurance market like this would implode.
Health insurance could fall apart even if some healthy people initially kept their policies. Insurers' costs would increase as more sick Americans took out insurance even as healthier Americans dropped theirs. Insurers would then raise their premiums, inducing even more healthy Americans to dump their insurance. Insurers would ratchet up premiums again. And so forth.
The individual mandate -- which comes with a fine ranging from $695 for poor Americans to $12,500 for rich families who choose to remain uninsured -- is aimed at discouraging this behavior. But some critics have argued that the stick is not nearly big enough.
Americans could pay the fine and still save money by skipping health insurance. Paul Starr, a professor of sociology at Princeton, notes that the government has little power to enforce the fines. It can't impose criminal sanctions or liens on the property of those who do not comply. It can't garnish their wages. The most it can do is withhold their tax refunds. Mr. Starr says he believes that in the end, the mandate will largely be ignored.
In this narrative, health reform fizzles regardless of the mandate's fate. With too few healthy Americans buying insurance, there would be enormous pressure to drop the requirement that insurers cover everybody at the same rates regardless of their health status, leaving insurers free to set premiums according to health profiles. And higher premiums would force many sick Americans off the insurance rolls.
Yet the portrayal of Americans as pure profit-seeking machines relentlessly on the lookout for a bargain is not entirely accurate. Sure, we appreciate a good deal when we see one. People have been known to do weird things to make, or save, an extra buck. When King William III introduced a tax in 1696 based on the number of windows in people's homes, the English responded by blocking their windows.
But there is plenty of evidence that other motivations influence our decisions: altruism, for instance. We like to believe we are fair and worthy. And we are willing to sacrifice some gain to fit the norms of society. ''The extreme view, that given the slightest opening people will grab anything they can get their hands on, is clearly wrong,'' notes Richard Thaler, an economist at the University of Chicago.
Social norms explain why we tip a cabdriver we will never see again, why cheaters blush when caught or why people go to the polls despite knowing their individual vote will make no difference. Government programs to help underwater homeowners have been held back for years over fear that they will encourage families who were still current with their mortgage payments to default. However, the evidence so far is that most people who can pay their mortgage do, even if they would profit from walking away.
Social norms can provide a much more powerful incentive than money. A few years ago, a handful of day care centers in Israel tried to get parents to pick up their children on time by imposing a fine for tardiness. Much to their surprise, tardiness mushroomed. The fine had somehow made it acceptable, erasing the shame parents used to feel when they were late. The fine, by contrast, was cheap.
Advocates of health reform argue that the individual mandate will create a social norm that will hold everything together. Without it, people merely have a subsidy to induce them to buy insurance. The mandate turns buying health insurance into the rule of the land, like paying taxes.
Jonathan Gruber, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who worked on modeling the president's health care reform, says he believes that eliminating the mandate will gut the president's plan. Only 10 million uninsured Americans would buy health insurance, he estimates, 22 million fewer than if the mandate remains.
He has evidence to back up his analysis: the health reform introduced in Massachusetts in 2006 by Gov. Mitt Romney, of which Mr. Gruber was a key architect. The state's program, which gradually put people under a mandate, led to a big jump in the enrollment of the young and healthy when the fines began.
A study by the America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry lobby group, found that the insurance market collapsed when states passed health reforms in the 1990s requiring insurers to cover everybody at the same price but without a mandate requiring the healthy to be insured. Kentucky, for instance, was left with one insurer in the individual health insurance market.
Even though the mandate may not be quite as powerful as Mr. Gruber believes, several analyses have concluded that it would pack substantial punch. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that without a mandate, 16 million fewer Americans would be insured. A study by the RAND Corporation said the number of newly insured would drop to 15 million without the mandate, from 27 million with it.
And yet Mr. Starr of Princeton has a point: for social norms to work, they probably need to be perceived as legitimate. Governor Romney's health reform passed with large bipartisan support in the state Legislature. Support for the law in Massachusetts rose from 48 percent when it was enacted in 2006 to 58 percent in 2007, when its provisions began to kick in, and 64 percent in 2008. By contrast, two-thirds of Americans want the Supreme Court to do away with all or part of Obamacare.
Making the mandate work requires convincing Americans that the new health care law is not a plot to destroy the nation. Americans would have to embrace universal coverage as a desirable goal for a rich industrial society. Otherwise, President Obama's reform may deliver the health care equivalent of a bunch of blocked English windows. The Supreme Court's decision will be beside the point,

HEADLINE: Turning to Frog For Illegal Aid In Horse Races

BYLINE: By WALT BOGDANICH and REBECCA R. RUIZ; Joe Drape contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Racing regulators kept hearing the reports: trainers were giving their horses a powerful performance-enhancing potion drawn from the backs of a type of South American frog.
But for months postrace testing could not find the substance, a painkiller far more powerful than morphine. Then a lab in the Denver area tweaked its testing procedure, and in recent weeks more than 30 horses from four states have tested positive for the substance, dermorphin, which is suspected of helping horses run faster.
No trainer has yet been formally charged, although racing regulators expect that to happen soon. Because of its potency and ability to affect the outcome of a race, the use of dermorphin is considered to be one of the industry's most serious drug violations. 
''We hear about some pretty exotic stuff,'' said Dr. Steven Barker, who directs the testing laboratory at Louisiana State University. ''Frog juice -- this is exotic.''
The discovery comes as the racing industry is struggling to counter perceptions of a pervasive drug culture. Indeed, dermorphin is the latest in a long list of illegal performance-enhancing drugs that have found their way onto racetracks. Cobra venom has also been used by trainers to deaden pain so that injured horses can race. It functions as a local nerve block, unlike dermorphin, a broader pain suppressant that is 40 times more powerful than morphine, Dr. Barker said.
If horses cannot feel their injuries, veterinarians say, they are more likely to run harder than they otherwise would.
Craig W. Stevens, a professor of pharmacology at Oklahoma State University who has studied dermorphin, said the substance makes animals ''hyper.''
''For a racehorse, it would be beneficial,'' he said. ''The animal wouldn't feel pain, and it would have feelings of excitation and euphoria.''
Mr. Stevens said dermorphin is found on the skin of a frog called Phyllomedusa sauvagei, commonly known as the waxy monkey tree frog, which is native to South America.
Dr. Barker said he suspected that most of the dermorphin had been artificially synthesized. ''There's a lot out there, and that would be an awful lot of frogs that would have to be squeezed,'' he said, adding, ''There are a lot of unemployed chemists out there.''
Other performance-enhancing drugs found in racehorses include those used to artificially bulk up cattle and pigs before slaughter.
''This is a tough issue,'' said Edward J. Martin, president of Racing Commissioners International, a trade association for racing regulators. ''It's a cat-and-mouse game. As soon as you call out dermorphin, they will try something else. That is the daily battle that goes on.''
How often dermorphin is used in racing is not known -- many states do not have the capability to test for it -- but so far laboratories have found it in Louisiana, Oklahoma and New Mexico. Its use is also suspected in Texas. Some of the results were first reported on nola.com, the Web site of The Times-Picayune in New Orleans.
''This whole thing has really taken us by surprise,'' said Charles A. Gardiner III, executive director of the Louisiana Racing Commission. ''It couldn't have come at a worse time. We're fighting back federal intervention. We're under attack and losing our fan base. Fans believe that the sport is dirty, that there is cheating. And here we have an obvious attempt to cheat.''
In Louisiana, Mr. Gardiner said, 11 horses, both quarter horses and thoroughbreds, tested positive for dermorphin, though none of them broke down. He said two quarter horses in particular earned big purses. ''A lot of money's got to be given back,'' he said.
Four thoroughbreds tested positive, with three finishing first and one second, all in races in May. ''I'm sure that there are more positives across the country,'' Mr. Gardiner said. ''It's not unusual that something isn't being detected.''
Dr. Barker of the Louisiana State lab said 15 horses in Oklahoma had tested positive for dermorphin. Oklahoma officials declined to comment, as did racing regulators in Texas.
Vince Mares, executive director of the New Mexico Racing Commission, said Tuesday that a California lab had found dermorphin in six postrace tests in New Mexico.
Industrial Laboratories in suburban Denver was the first lab to successfully identify dermorphin in postrace testing. It was not easy.
Petra Hartmann, director of direct testing services for the company, said clients relayed tips from racetrack workers that the frog secretion was being used, and later some seized materials turned out to be dermorphin.
''We identified dermorphin,'' Ms. Hartmann said. ''We knew it was out there.'' But, she said, the lab's test could not identify the drug in horses after they raced.
After racing regulators kept insisting that the substance was in use, ''We went back to the drawing board,'' Ms. Hartmann said. Industrial's chief scientist subsequently developed a more sensitive test, specifically for this compound, she said.
''There is no resting in this business,'' she said. ''You are always chasing something, trying to determine what's rumor, what's real.''
Ms. Hartmann said she did not believe the use of dermorphin was widespread. ''The vast majority of horsemen would never subject their horse to this kind of chemical experimentation,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Splitting Up Ownership to Ride Out a Rough Spot

BYLINE: By MATT HUDGINS

 BODY:
It is not obvious from the names on the deeds, but 655 Madison Avenue, the Backer Building at 136 Madison Avenue and 304 East 45th Street in Manhattan share a new owner.
All three office buildings still belong to the joint ventures that have owned them for years, but in January a real estate private equity company, Madison International Realty, paid nearly $80 million to acquire ownership stakes in those partnerships. Madison bought the positions from the Irene Diamond Fund, which needed to liquidate its part in the portfolio to support its philanthropic activities.
Such ''partial interest'' deals, as they are known, are becoming more common in Manhattan, as they allow landlords to retain some control over properties that might otherwise revert to lenders through default and foreclosure when the final, balloon mortgage payment comes due. (Commercial loans are typically not self-amortizing.)
''Most of the real estate business is about ego and control, and if you talk to most of the usual suspects, they want to go out and buy buildings,'' said Ronald Dickerman, Madison's president and founder. ''But we've created a really interesting business out of buying these partial interests in a private and underexposed niche of the commercial real estate business.'' 
Partial-interest deals accounted for $9.9 billion, or 63 percent, of the $15.7 billion in Manhattan office transactions in 2011, according to Real Capital Analytics, a market researcher based in New York. That percentage is up sharply since the height of the market in 2007, when partial-interest deals made up less than $5.7 billion, or 19 percent, of Manhattan's $30.3 billion in office deals for the year.
Many of today's transactions are recapitalizations, in which the property owner uses an outside investor's capital and credibility to persuade the lender or lenders to restructure the property's debt. In exchange, the new investor typically gains equity, or an owning interest in the property. Often requiring lengthy negotiations among lenders and other stakeholders, the resulting deals usually bring the new investor into the existing ownership structure.
That is how Vornado Realty Trust acquired its 49.5 percent stake in the office part of 666 Fifth Avenue late last year. Kushner Companies had bought the 1.45 million-square-foot 39-story property for $1.8 billion in January 2007, but by the spring of 2010 Kushner was already negotiating with a special servicer to make the debt more manageable. Last December, Kushner and Vornado announced a joint venture that modified the $1.215 billion mortgage and extended its term until February 2019. In addition to taking on the debt, Vornado reported that it had invested $80 million in the venture.
The growing frequency of partial-interest transactions also explains why many so-called vulture investors, which have amassed funds to snatch up office buildings from distressed owners forced to sell at a loss, are still waiting on the sidelines for properties to show up on the auction block.
''These recapitalizations are the reason there isn't blood on the streets,'' said Dan Fasulo, the managing director at Real Capital Analytics, ''and all this is taking place behind the scenes. That's going to be a template going forward.''
Other recent examples include the purchase in May by Crown Acquisitions of a 49.9 percent interest in the Olympic Tower complex at 641 Fifth Avenue. In March, the Paramount Group, a privately held real estate investment manager, bought out Investa Office Fund of Australia's 49 percent stake in 900 Third Avenue to consolidate Paramount's ownership of the 604,000-square-foot office building
Of the 98 Manhattan office transactions that have closed since the beginning of 2010 for properties valued at $100 million or more, 40 involved partial-interest deals or recapitalizations, Real Capital's data shows.
Three distinct market forces will keep the recapitalization fires burning for at least the next few years, said Jay Neveloff, a partner at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel in New York. One is the plentiful supply of capital that investors are eager to place in New York's promising real estate properties.
The other two are maturing commercial mortgages, which must be paid off and replaced with new financing, and conservative lending practices. In 2006 and 2007, lenders were commonly financing as much as 90 percent of an office property's value, but both loan-to-value ratios and asset values have come down since then. This creates shortfalls as investors seek financing to replace debts obtained before the financial crisis.
''It's hard to find new lenders that will refinance buildings at the same level today,'' Mr. Neveloff said. ''The lender might say, 'We will consider extending the loan, but we want the principal reduced.' That's a great opportunity for some of the abundant money on the sidelines to come in and invest in the property.''
Investors might prefer to buy office buildings outright, but few Manhattan owners are marketing their properties for sale. One possible deterrent to conventional sales is transfer tax, which the seller must pay upon selling 50 percent or more of a property.
The combined city and state transfer tax in Manhattan is 3.025 percent, one of the highest rates in the nation. The frequency of 49 percent office trades in recent months suggests that sellers are well aware of this tax trigger and are taking steps to avoid that cost through partial-interest transactions.
At a time when governments are facing deficits, the increase in partial-interest transactions means that millions of dollars invested in the New York office market this year will not be subject to transfer tax, said J. D. Parker, a vice president and regional manager in the Manhattan office of Marcus & Millichap Real Estate Investment Services. ''A lot of people will buy up to 49 percent of a deal so they won't be subjected to that tax,'' Mr. Parker said. ''That's a legitimate concern for the local and state economy.''
Yet the situation is temporary, he believes. Once job growth brings increased demand for office space, rents and property values will begin to climb, making it easier for owners to finance their buildings or garner healthy sale prices. At that point, most investors will abandon the complexities of partial-interest investments and return to the relative simplicity of buying and selling entire properties.
''It's a necessary form of capital event that is required right now in the marketplace,'' Mr. Parker said, ''but the market would prefer, at all points in the cycle, to be less complicated.''
Madison, the new part-owner of 655 Madison and the other assets it bought stakes in earlier this year, has invested millions of dollars in partial-interest real estate transactions around the globe, and plans to keep doing so. But Mr. Dickerman, the company's president, agrees that the herd of investors making similar transactions today will ditch the partial-interest investment model once market conditions change.
''They'd rather own the buildings than buy partial interests in buildings,'' he said, ''so I believe it's a bit of a passing fancy.''

HEADLINE: Environmental Groups Say They Will Fight Drilling Plan

BYLINE: By DANNY HAKIM

 BODY:
ALBANY -- A coalition of environmental groups plans to campaign against a proposal that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is weighing to approve limited drilling for natural gas, the groups said Tuesday. 
The coalition includes a mix of nationally known organizations -- like the Sierra Club, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Advocates of New York -- and smaller, local groups. The groups have had some differences over the drilling technique, called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking: some oppose it under all circumstances, while others indicate that they are open to compromise. But all have signed a joint statement opposing the use of the technique without an independent assessment of its safety.
''Any decision as to whether or not to frack anywhere in New York State should not be made before the impacts to our health, environment and economy have been comprehensively and properly assessed,'' the environmental groups said in the statement, which was prompted by a report last week in The New York Times that said the Cuomo administration was pursuing a plan to limit fracking to counties along the Pennsylvania border.
''Until we have a complete and independent study of the impacts to public health and the environment and the costs to our communities, the state will simply not be in a position to make a decision as to whether fracking should be permitted in New York.''
In hydraulic fracturing, large amounts of sand, water and chemicals are injected deep underground at high pressures to extract natural gas from rock formations, a process that has raised concerns about groundwater contamination. The Cuomo administration's plan, if put into effect, would limit drilling to the deepest areas of the Marcellus Shale rock formation in an effort to reduce the risk of such contamination, and even then would allow fracking only in towns that approved it.
The editorial boards of a number of newspapers, including The Times, The Poughkeepsie Journal and The Times Union of Albany, have expressed openness to the idea of limited fracking, but have generally called for a cautious approach.

HEADLINE: Robert A.M. Stern

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Stern, 73, a modern traditionalist architect, is the founder of Robert A. M. Stern Architects, the dean of the Yale School of Architecture and the author of several architecture books.
His firm, based in New York, has been involved in many projects worldwide, including a revitalization of Manhattan's theater district. One of his most notable buildings is 15 Central Park West, where a penthouse was recently bought through a trust linked to a Russian fertilizer billionaire for $88 million, the most ever paid for an apartment in New York City.
Interview conducted and condensed by 
VIVIAN MARINO
Q.I have to ask you straight away: Did you ever, in your wildest dreams, think that 15 Central Park West would become as successful as it is today, with deep-pocketed foreigners paying record-high condo prices?
A. I always thought it was going to be a very important building, and I thought it would find a particular place in the market of people who appreciate what it means to live in New York. But I can't say that I ever imagined that it would reach the stratospheric heights from a real estate point of view that it has.
Q. What's the big attraction?
A. At 15 Central Park West, I was very much cognizant of the great buildings that surround Central Park. And the apartments are also very special. We have produced apartments at 15 Central Park West that do live up to the reputation of prewar accommodations.
Q.You currently live in another building you designed, the Chatham, on the Upper East Side. Did you ever consider relocating to 15 Central Park West?
A. I'm very happy there. So I didn't think of moving, no.
When I moved to the Chatham, of course, I had my pick of apartments in the building and I was able to tinker around with one. My living room and dining room is a big, long room that has windows on three sides -- that's a luxury in New York -- and it overlooks a garden and it has French doors that can be opened up until, unfortunately, the moths come in.
Q.Many of your buildings like 15 Central Park West and the Chatham have that prewar aesthetic. But there are some critics who call your designs too traditional, even uninspiring.
A. Well, if it's too traditional or uninspiring to them, there are others who find it traditional in an inspiring way -- that one can go back to go forward and restate things that are there. I think that the obsession with the new-new thing is O.K. for computer apps. Architecture is about place and time in the long sense of the word.
Q.Would you say you favor the neo-Classical style?
A. Well, I wouldn't use the term neo-Classical. I like to work in the traditions of the local place wherever I'm building.
Q.Is there a way, though, to define your overall style?
A. We're not interested in this office in personal style. We're interested in finding the expression for each project in relationship to what we and our clients think is appropriate to the project, to the place. So what we build in Manhattan and different sites in Manhattan are different.
I don't see architecture as being about autobiography. I see it more as an art of portrait painting. Portraits of places, institutions.
Q.Do you have a favorite property type, or maybe even a building that you've designed?
A. I would never say because then I'd have a client who would say, ''Oh, you're not interested in my project.''
And, no I never have a favorite building. I have a favorite son, because he's my only son.
Q.You've also been referred to as a ''starchitect.''
A. That's a term used for a lot of people. But since my name is Stern and ''Stern'' means star, I think that's perfectly good. It's all the other people that are intruding.
Q.So how is business?
A. We're pretty busy. I would say that we're maybe a little bit busier than last year, but I wouldn't use us as an indicator of the economy.
Q.How many projects is the firm working on now?
A. We are working on quite a few projects -- about 95, either on the boards or in construction -- and we're entered into some competitions.
Our practice is really quite international. We have projects on mainland China and in Hong Kong, and we have some commercial office buildings in India under construction and then one in Paris that's under construction. A lot of the institutional work tends to be in the United States, on college campuses.
Q.How involved are you in each project?
A. It's a collaborative venture, but I would like to think that I put my hand on everything. I always get involved in the beginnings of the projects most intensely.
Q.One of your new projects is a building for the Related Companies, at the Hudson Yards site on the Far West Side of Manhattan.
A. Yes, and it's going into construction soon. We're in the foothills of the Hudson Yards. It's right outside our windows here. I'm going to lose our view.
Q.How do you divide your time between running an architecture firm and the architecture school at Yale?
A. Well, I try during term time to be there three days a week and two days in the office. And I use my weekends to catch up on things for both of my masters, as it were. But in the summer I spend a little less time in New Haven. On the weekends I also tend to do my writing.
Q.I've heard that you never use the computer.
A. This office is totally computer-sophisticated, but I personally don't use the computer. I still draw and sketch; I love models.
I think the computer is a wonderful tool, but it tends to alienate designers in the relationship between their hand, eye and brain. The architects I admire mostly don't use the computer for design; they use it to realize their projects.
Q.I see you're wearing your trademark yellow socks.
A. Yes I am. I always wear my yellow socks. I've become famous for my yellow socks, so I can't not wear my yellow socks. Sometimes on the weekend, though, I go crazy and wear blue ones.

HEADLINE: City Moves Homeless, Storing Their Stuff

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
SAN JOSE, Calif. -- For years, the authorities periodically swept the banks of San Jose's waterways, dismantling and discarding the elaborate, makeshift homes built by hundreds of homeless people. Tons of debris cleared, the homeless returned within days or hours.
The cat-and-mouse game served to check their numbers, at least enough to prevent a flood of complaints from residents nearby. But maintaining that balance has recently grown more complicated: fearing lawsuits by advocates for the homeless, the city has begun storing the belongings of people whose encampments have been cleared. 
''The city of San Jose has become hip to that,'' said Anna Davis, 45, standing in the woods along a creek where the city had just dismantled her shack. ''They can't just step over us anymore.''
City officials will store the belongings collected from three trial cleanups for 90 days before assessing the new policy's cost and effectiveness. Nine people were removed from half a dozen makeshift homes this week, representing a fraction of the 800 to 1,000 people living along this city's waterways. The total homeless population is more than 4,000, according to city figures.
Like many other places here in Silicon Valley and in the Bay Area just north, San Jose is struggling to cope with entrenched homeless encampments that proliferated during the financial crisis. Faced with increasingly impatient homeowners, residents and businesses, communities long known for their tolerance of the homeless, like San Francisco, have taken a harder stance by trying to restrict the behavior and presence of the homeless in public areas.
Berkeley, a magnet for the homeless because of its generous social services, is considering an ordinance that would prohibit sitting on sidewalks in commercial areas between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. The move, homeless advocates say, reflects a nationwide trend of criminalizing homelessness.
''It's homeless fatigue,'' said Neil Donovan, executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless in Washington.
New homeless encampments first cropped up in late 2007 along the West Coast before spreading to the rest of the country, Mr. Donovan said. Despite the improving economy, the number of encampments has remained steady because of cuts in social services.
In San Jose, encampments, which tend to be clustered and hidden in the woods along Coyote Creek and the Guadalupe River, have increased because of rising rents, stubborn unemployment and cuts in social services and outreach workers, according to a recent city report.
Last year the city and county water district spent about $250,000 removing a total of 175 tons of material in 36 sweeps. Given 72 hours' notice, many of the homeless took their most valuable possessions, leaving behind trash for the authorities to collect, said Leslee Hamilton, executive director of the Guadalupe River Park Conservancy.
''They would come back to a clean place,'' Ms. Hamilton said. ''It was concierge service.''
Though the cleanups offered no real solution to the homeless problem, they were necessary to keep the encampments from swelling and waterways from becoming overpolluted, city officials said.
''This is about the homeless, the environment and the community,'' said Leslye Corsiglia, the city's housing director. ''It's too simple to say it's just a homeless problem.''
Last fall, two homeless people whose possessions had been discarded during cleanups filed complaints with the city's independent police auditor, LaDoris Cordell. Ms. Cordell dug up a long-forgotten 1990 city memo that required the city to keep the belongings of the homeless, and she warned that San Jose was vulnerable to lawsuits filed by advocates for the homeless for violating the memo's guidelines.
In 2008, the city of Fresno settled a suit for $2.35 million for destroying the belongings of hundreds of homeless during sweeps. The authorities suspended the cleanups in San Jose in March, leading to more complaints about growing encampments near residential areas. In late May, they decided to resume the cleanups, but with the new storage policy and a new emphasis on moving the homeless into temporary shelters and eventually long-term housing. The homeless can reclaim their possessions at a city warehouse.
''Would you rather spend money on vouchers, getting them into motels and some sort of subsidized housing, or on what Fresno did to settle a lawsuit?'' Ms. Cordell said.
At the first trial cleanup in late May, the authorities collected six tons of material from six people's camp under an overpass and stored 38 60-gallon bags of possessions, said Jennifer Garnett, a spokeswoman for the city's environmental services, adding that the cleanup cost $7,000.
Of the six homeless people there, only one remains in a temporary shelter provided by social workers, and two have already returned to the spot under the overpass, Ms. Garnett said.
A later cleanup yielded better results, with all but one of nine homeless people accepting offers of temporary shelter at a motel. Using a two-year, $500,000 grant from the Environmental Protection Agency, Downtown Streets Team, a private organization, hired some of the homeless to clean stretches of Coyote Creek regularly in their area, paying them $100 a week. The homeless people will stay at the motel until the end of the month before moving into long-term housing, said Eileen Richardson, the organization's executive director.
The morning of the cleanup, Felix Ramiro Casillas, the one person who declined to go to the motel, enjoyed his last minutes in the shack that he had carved out of the creek bank. He had raised a plywood roof over his bedroom, fashioning a skylight with plastic bags over his bed. A nonworking television sat in the middle of the room, surrounded by paintings, artificial flowers and a collection of wine glasses.
''That's Tiffany,'' he said, picking up a glass. ''That's why I keep it.''
Mr. Casillas, who is in his 40s, said he had been at the same spot for four years. He had returned after every annual cleanup, rebuilding from scratch, and said he would do so again this time. He once worked as a waiter and gardener in San Francisco, he said, but began hearing voices in his left ear about five years ago.
''I can't live with other people because I yell at night and they get upset with me,'' he said.
As city workers began carrying away his shack, piece by piece, Mr. Casillas pushed a shopping cart filled with favorite paintings and other possessions. Ignoring the calls of social workers, Mr. Casillas, wearing a cowboy hat, sunglasses and a leather jacket, hurried through the park. A yellow earplug was lodged in his left ear.

HEADLINE: Coin Collection Is Partly Saved By a Loan

BYLINE: By FELICIA R. LEE

 BODY:
When the financially struggling Hispanic Society of America decided to sell its collection of nearly 38,000 rare coins last year, that Upper Manhattan museum sought to allay fears that its cultural treasure would become inaccessible to scholars and the public by striving to find a public institution to buy it. None, however, was found to purchase the collection, valued at more than $25 million; the coins landed in private hands; and some of those scholars' concerns are now being realized.
About 1,000 of the coins will be auctioned in Madrid next week, likely to scatter them even more. But an unidentified American coin buff who bought 10,000 pieces from the collection recently arranged a long-term loan with the American Numismatic Society, making them publicly available, said Ute Wartenberg Kagan, the executive director of the Numismatic Society, whose headquarters are at Hudson Square in the South Village. 
Though Ms. Wartenberg Kagan said she was saddened by the dismantling of the collection, the loan softens the blow.
''The Hispanic Society got the money, and we got 10,000 of the really good coins,'' she said. ''It's good for New York, having this material back, because who knows where it will end up. This type of collection disappears and is never seen again.''
The Hispanic Society, a museum and research library that focuses primarily on the Old World cultures of Spain and Portugal, has some impressive holdings, including major paintings by Goya and El Greco and important manuscripts and prints. But it has long struggled to attract visitors and donors to its stately Beaux-Arts building in Washington Heights, and faced with a shrinking endowment and trust assets, it put the coins up for a sealed-bid auction at Sotheby's New York to finance acquisitions.
The Hispanic Society's collection was considered one of the world's most important related to the sweep of Spanish history. It included the 50 Excelentes, a gold coin weighing nearly five ounces that Sotheby's described as ''the largest gold coin from the 15th century that survives today.'' It also had more than 400 Roman gold coins that span the full history of Rome, including examples struck under Julius Caesar.
Nine thousand of the coins arrived at the Numismatic Society late last week, joining 1,000 that had arrived earlier. Ms. Wartenberg Kagan said the batch included more than 1,000 coins of the Visigoths (''arguably the most important Visigothic collection in the world,'' she said); other early-medieval coins; more than 3,000 bronze and silver Roman coins; and about 4,000 Spanish coins of medieval and later periods.
''The greatest concern about any dispersal of the collection focused largely on the coins now back at the Numismatic Society,'' Mitchell A. Codding, the Hispanic Society's executive director, said. ''They have been heavily researched, and there is constant utilization by scholars. It's good they'll be available to scholars.''
The sale in Madrid by the dealer Jesus Vico and the loan to the Numismatic Society were reported last week in the CultureGrrl blog, which reports on a variety of cultural affairs.
The arrival of the coins at the Numismatic Society represents a homecoming of sorts. Archer Milton Huntington, a railroad magnate's heir who founded the Hispanic Society, had donated the coin collection to the Numismatic Society more than half a century ago. In 2007 the Hispanic Society asked for the coins back, and after Numismatic Society officials protested, won a court order in 2008 for their return.
Ms. Wartenberg Kagan has in the past argued that it was her belief that Huntington intended the coins to remain at the Numismatic Society and that selling material integral to the Hispanic Society's mission should not be allowed. The deaccessioning, or sale, of museum artworks has increasingly been under sharp focus, as some opponents of the practice worry that institutions are jettisoning artistically valuable works because of economic pressures. The New York State Board of Regents last year made permanent a set of regulations enjoining museums from selling art to cover operating costs.
Mr. Codding contended that the coins were never formally a part of the Hispanic Society's collection or mission.
Despite the current easing of tension between the Numismatic Society and the Hispanic Society, scholars are concerned that the collection has been split. Alan Stahl, the curator of numismatics at Princeton University, said he hoped that at least the coins lent to the Numismatic Society would eventually be donated outright.
''I want it all,'' Mr. Stahl said, ''with all the information possible, with the history of each piece to be available for study, for exhibition, for illustrations.''

HEADLINE: Shares Rise On Hopes Fed Will Act

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rose Tuesday on hopes that the Federal Reserve will extend stimulus measures as the economy struggles to recover and the euro zone's debt crisis worsens.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has gained 7.2 percent from a five-month intraday low reached on June 4. But the sharp gains leave the market vulnerable if the outcome of Wednesday's Fed meeting does not meet market expectations. 
''People are anticipating some type of response from the Fed tomorrow, and are buying or covering shorts in anticipation of that,'' said Paul Zemsky, head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management in New York. ''There's a risk the market gets disappointed.''
Growth-related stocks led the rally. U.S. Steel rose 9.5 percent, to $20.15, while Bank of America added 4.5 percent, to $8.11.
Markets kept an eye on developments in Europe. A sharp decline in German business sentiment, alongside stubbornly high Spanish bond yields, raised expectations for stimulus from European policy makers as well.
British media reports earlier said that Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was poised to use Europe's dual bailout funds, the European Financial Stability Facility and the European Stability Mechanism, to buy debt of countries like Italy and Spain.
''We went to the highs of the day on that, and we have the Fed tomorrow. This is a bailout, central bank largess bounce,'' Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak in New York, said.
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 95.51 points, or 0.75 percent, to 12,837.33 at the close. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 13.20 points, or 0.98 percent, to 1,357.98. The Nasdaq composite index ended up 34.43 points, or 1.19 percent, to 2,929.76.
On Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee began a two-day meeting on interest rates. The meeting got under way with expectations rising that the bank may extend its effort to drive down long-term borrowing costs.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 14/32, to 101 6/32 and the yield rose to 1.62 percent from 1.57 percent late Monday.
Oracle rose 3.1 percent, to $27.96 a day after it reported stronger-than-expected quarterly profit.
Walgreen tumbled 5.9 percent. to $30.09 after it posted lower quarterly earnings and said it would buy a 45 percent stake in Alliance Boots.

HEADLINE: Seeking New Roles for Landmarks That Share a Street in Providence, R.I.

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH ABBOTT

 BODY:
PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Two landmark buildings in this city's downtown have been in the news a lot lately, but for decidedly different reasons.
The Arcade, an enclosed three-story shopping center that was built in 1828 and is considered by many to be the country's first shopping mall, is undergoing a $7 million overhaul that includes the creation of 48 residential rental units on the building's second and third floors.
But another downtown landmark, the 26-story ''Superman building,'' is about to lose its only tenant, creating concern that a large, vacant office building will hurt the city's image and drag down an economy that is still struggling to recover from the recession. As illustration, Rhode Island's unemployment, at roughly 11 percent, is nearly three points higher than the national average. 
The Superman building, an Art Deco skyscraper, has defined the city's skyline since it was built in the late 1920s as the Industrial Trust Building. Located just down the street from the Arcade, it closely resembles the building that Superman soared by in the early television series.
A majority of the apartments in the Arcade will be ''micro-lofts'' under 300 square feet, a modest size chosen to keep rents affordable for students graduating from Providence's colleges and universities, said the building's owner and developer, Evan Granoff. Rents will start at $550 a month and, because the apartments are small, the cost of utilities should be low as well, he said.
The Arcade has always been a commercial building, but Mr. Granoff said converting it to residential use made sense because more people were moving downtown and institutions like Brown University and Johnson & Wales University now played bigger roles in the city's economy.
There is a waiting list for the apartments, even though the Arcade will not reopen until this fall, he said.
Fourteen small shops are planned for the first floor, which Mr. Granoff hopes will mimic a department store experience for shoppers. Three restaurants will be on the ground floor as well. The design for the renovation respects the Arcade's original Greek Revival style, but the building will be modernized with double-hung windows to bring in more light, Mr. Granoff said.
''It's been like a diamond encased in rock,'' he said.
The Arcade has been shuttered for the last three years. In that time, the Providence Preservation Society placed it on its list of the city's 10 most endangered properties. When Mr. Granoff announced plans to reopen the Arcade as a mixed-use development early this year, the news was welcomed by elected officials and civic leaders, who called it an important development for the city's downtown.
The city entered into a tax stabilization agreement with Mr. Granoff to help make the renovation happen.
''This project breathes new life into America's oldest indoor mall and one of our city's most historically significant buildings,'' Mayor Angel Taveras said at a news conference in January announcing the renovation.
The Arcade has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1971. It is notable not only for its striking architecture, which includes Ionic columns at both entrances to the building, but also for the memories many Rhode Islanders have of strolling through the building.
Like the Arcade, the Superman Building resonates in the emotions of many Rhode Islanders. It is owned by the High Rock Equities Fund I, based in Wellesley, Mass., which bought the building for roughly $33 million four and a half years ago, according to David C. Sweetser, the fund's founder. At that time, Bank of America was the sole tenant with a 10-year lease and about 350 employees working in the building.
But that lease is expiring in April 2013, and Bank of America has decided not to renew it. The result is a full-court press by the city and state, working with the owners, to find new tenants.
While a sole tenant would be the most convenient option, Mr. Sweetser said several ideas were on the table, including a conversion into a mixed-use high-rise, with garden apartments on the top floors. Gov. Lincoln D. Chafee recently proposed moving state offices into the Superman building, an idea Mr. Sweetser said he would consider.
''I've spent a lot of money on this building,'' Mr. Sweetser said, ''and I'll spend more.''

HEADLINE: Japanese Officials Failed to Use U.S. Data Tracking Radiation After Tsunami

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI; Matthew L. Wald contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The United States shared detailed radiation measurements with Japan in the early days of the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster that the Japanese government did not make public or use in conducting evacuations, officials acknowledged on Tuesday.
Lacking information about the direction of airborne particles, some evacuees fled, unknowingly, into the path of the radioactive plume. Others stayed for more than a month in areas with high radiation, because they lay beyond the government-imposed 12-mile evacuation zone. 
Trade Minister Yukio Edano, who oversees Japan's nuclear regulator, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency, apologized Tuesday for the blunder.
''It is extremely regrettable that the government did not appropriately share or use the information, and I feel remorse toward the victims,'' Mr. Edano said at a news conference. It is unknown whether the government's failure to release the data as soon as it was available threatened the health of any civilians.
The failure is being seen by critics in Japan as another example of the government's early attempts to play down the severity of the accident by withholding damaging information. Government officials also withheld forecasts from a computer system that calculates the spread of radiation because they believed that the estimates were incomplete and inaccurate.
Starting on March 17, 2011, as residents fled from the areas around the tsunami-stricken Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the United States sent aircraft to measure radiation levels in the vicinity, according to the Energy Department.
The Energy Department then used the data, collected from over 40 hours of flight time over Fukushima, to compile a detailed map that showed an area of high radiation extending northwest from the plant. Measurements ''show an area of greater radiation extending northwest from the accident,'' materials accompanying the map warned. ''This area may be of interest to public safety officials and responders.''
According to Japanese officials, the United States government shared the data with Japan's Foreign Ministry through its embassy in Tokyo on March 18, a day after helicopters frantically dropped water on a blown-out reactor building to keep spent fuel rods there from overheating.
The Foreign Ministry immediately alerted the nuclear safety agency to the radiation readings, according to Masaru Sato, director of the ministry's international press division.
But it is unclear what happened next. There is no indication that the nuclear safety agency shared that data with Naoto Kan, the prime minister at the time, or other high-ranking officials, or that it used the maps to guide evacuations.
The Foreign Ministry also shared the data on March 20 with Japan's Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, which is responsible for monitoring radiation levels. But instead of using and publicizing the data, the technology ministry asked the Foreign Ministry to confirm that the United States approved of the data being made public, Mr. Sato said.
The Foreign Ministry relayed that question to the United States Embassy. Three days later, on March 24, Japan received assurances that the data could be made public. (The Energy Department had already made the map available on its Web site.)
By that time, some evacuees had already fled northwest, into the path of the radioactivity. And it took the Japanese government another month, and its own testing of radiation levels, to start evacuating contaminated areas outside the 12-mile zone -- areas like the town of Namie and the village of Iitate, which had been clearly visible in the Energy Department's initial maps.
Namie and Iitate were not fully evacuated until months after the disaster.
The sharing of data with the Japanese in the early days of the disaster was first reported Monday by The Asahi Shimbun.
An American official with knowledge of the Tokyo Embassy's interactions with the Japanese government said that American nuclear experts realized that their information had not been passed up the Japanese chain of command, but that this was not clear to them early on.
In the United States, government executives and local and state officials are supposed to be able to use wind data and field readings in managing evacuations. In drills conducted once every two years at each site, and graded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, one of the criteria for success is using the data to ensure that residents are not directed into the plume.
The World Health Organization, which estimated doses received by the public in the first year after the accident, has said that residents of Namie and Iitate received up to 50 millisieverts' worth of radiation exposure each, more than double a government-set emergency limit for civilians of 20 millisieverts. At these levels, however, any increase in incidences of cancer might never be epidemiologically proved.
Scrutiny of the government's response to the nuclear disaster comes at a delicate time for Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, who took over from Mr. Kan in September. Since taking office, Mr. Noda has pushed to restore public confidence in nuclear energy and restart Japan's reactor fleet.
The country went temporarily nuclear-free in early May, as the last of its 54 reactors shut down for maintenance, and local opposition prevented others from coming back online.
But on Saturday, Mr. Noda announced that the government would soon restart two reactors in Ohi, in western Japan, much to the public's chagrin. Critics here continue to accuse the government of playing down the accident -- as well as potential health risks, and vulnerabilities that might plague the nation's other reactors.
''Prime Minister Noda's rushed, dangerous approval of the Ohi nuclear power plant restart ignores expert safety advice and public outcry,'' Junichi Sato, executive director of Greenpeace Japan, said in a statement after the restarts were announced. He ''needlessly risks the health of Japan's environment, its people and its economy,'' Mr. Sato said.

HEADLINE: Leaders Make Little Headway in Solving Debt Crisis

BYLINE: By HELENE COOPER; Nicholas Kulish contributed reporting from Berlin.

 BODY:
SAN JOSE DEL CABO, Mexico -- President Obama and other world leaders pronounced themselves united in the effort to increase growth and employment in the global economy on Tuesday, but appeared to make only modest headway in persuading Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to drop her opposition to more government spending to alleviate Europe's debt crisis.
Meeting in the desert scrub of Mexico's Baja region in an effort to lift the sputtering world economy, the leaders of the so-called Group of 20 eschewed specific commitments, instead limiting themselves to more generalized promises to invest in public works, overhaul labor markets and use innovation, education and infrastructure investment to fuel economic growth. A more detailed plan to address Europe's crisis is expected to emerge next week after a European summit meeting in Brussels.
The meeting did, however, appear to foreshadow a move toward deeper banking integration in Europe, including possible action to put together a banking union that would guarantee deposits. But such a pact is still a ways off, and leaders, worried that the lack of more aggressive action would roil already unsteady world markets, waited until the close of the trading day on Wall Street before releasing their official statements. 
Ms. Merkel, who has been under increasing pressure from Mr. Obama and some of her European counterparts to ease up on Germany's austerity-first prescription for the rest of Europe, appeared to take heart from the victory on Sunday of pro-Europe forces in Greece, thereby confirming the fears of some economists and European and American officials who fret that the Greek results might remove the impetus for quick action.
''Elections cannot call into question the commitments Greece made,'' Ms. Merkel told reporters. ''We cannot compromise on the reform steps we agreed on.''
With his own re-election chances directly tied to the European economic crisis as it drags down growth in the United States, Mr. Obama desperately wants Ms. Merkel to loosen the reins on spending and the austerity programs that have been imposed on Greece and the other struggling euro zone economies.
Toward that end, the president spent two days in Mexico shuttling between Ms. Merkel and other European leaders in an effort to get them to sign onto a specific pro-growth agenda. But for all his influence as the leader of the biggest economy in the world, Mr. Obama sometimes seemed a bystander, there to exhort and cajole the other European leaders (especially the German chancellor) but little else.
Mr. Obama acknowledged at a news conference at the close of the summit meeting that none of the steps announced here included ''a silver bullet.'' But he added that he believed ''the sense of urgency among the leaders is clear.''
At times, the meeting of the world's biggest economies, occurring in almost a split-screen fashion as a fragile, new Greek government was trying to form in Athens, had a surreal atmosphere. The meeting's host -- Mexico -- serenaded reporters assembled for the closing news conference with Puccini's operatic Nessun Dorma, in what seemed like a plea to Europe's leaders to try to avoid further catastrophe.
The countries represented -- 19 nations and the European Union -- agreed to take the ''necessary actions'' to strengthen global growth and restore confidence, and promised that the euro zone countries would work to safeguard the euro's stability.
The agreement reached by the leaders did open the door to more lending and spending if the European economy worsens. ''Should economic conditions deteriorate significantly further, those countries with sufficient fiscal space stand ready to coordinate and implement discretionary fiscal actions to support domestic demand,'' the statement said.
The leaders seemed to hint that they had brought Germany closer to the notion of a more integrated European banking system -- like the American F.D.I.C. -- that would pay to insure deposits in the event of failing institutions. ''We support the intention to consider concrete steps toward a more integrated financial architecture, encompassing banking supervision, resolution and recapitalization, and deposit insurance,'' the statement said.
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said he was ''encouraged,'' and pointed to next week's meeting in Brussels as a chance to see the Europeans put more flesh on the bones of their banking union plans.
Ms. Merkel said during a news conference: ''From the side of the European Union, we argued unanimously and collectively that we are determined to solve the crisis, and to do it in a mix of fiscal consolidation, growth initiatives, and deepening of European cooperation. That reached very attentive ears here.''
But she added pointedly that a significant stimulus program, like the coordinated actions in the wake of the financial crisis, ''cannot simply be repeated,'' and even said that Mr. Obama agreed. ''The American president said, and we on the European side said, that doesn't work, the debts are too high for that.''
That may be an oversimplification of the American position, since Obama administration officials have spent the last year trying to point to the example of the steps that they took, including the stimulus, to jump-start the economy in 2008 and 2009.
American officials at the summit meeting hoped that for all of Ms. Merkel's tough talk, her hard line was starting to soften. One hope is that she and other European leaders will allow the European Central Bank to create low-interest Eurobonds by either pumping in cash or pooling German debt with that of the weaker euro zone members. ''We're seeing a shift in the European discussion regarding the critical importance of supporting demand and job growth,'' said Lael Brainard, the under secretary for international affairs at the Treasury Department.
A senior administration official said that the ''tone'' coming from the Europeans was, at long last, different from two years ago, and that the European leaders were starting to listen to Mr. Obama's lead-by-example message. ''There was a long period many times over two and a half years when we came saying the basic lesson of the fiscal crisis was to keep focused on making growth stronger,'' the administration official said. ''But a lot of people said they wanted to focus on the long term.''
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was ''a very welcome recognition of a significant change in tone by everyone now.''
The meeting has been taking place just as the fragile global economy is stalling again, with the United States the sole bright spot, but even that is relative, given that American employment growth has weakened again. Britain and European countries seem to be either in recession or on the edge of recession, and emerging markets like China and Brazil are not picking up the slack.
Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy and economics at Cornell University, argues that political paralysis both in Europe and the United States have so hurt confidence that it has ''stunted the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies.''

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Michigan Looks Like More Fertile Ground to Romney Campaign

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
DeWITT, Mich. -- Mitt Romney spent Tuesday baking pies here in this city just north of Lansing, but his campaign also sent a message to President Obama: Mr. Romney says he believes that Michigan is up for grabs in November, and if nothing else, his campaign plans to force Mr. Obama and the Democrats to spend time and money defending turf that, until recently, seemed safely in the blue.
Campaign aides say they believe that Michigan is, in fact, in play for Mr. Romney, who came of age here as the son of an auto executive turned governor of the state. They pointed to his full slate of events here Tuesday, the final swing of a five-day bus tour, as a sign of his seriousness about the state. 
And if nothing else, Mr. Romney's most recent dip into Michigan serves as a good test run in a state that at worst will force Mr. Obama and the Democrats to spend resources that they would prefer to deploy elsewhere.
As Mr. Romney said Monday night, in a brief conversation with reporters on his plane, ''Who knows at this early stage, but I think Michigan's a state I can win.''
When asked if the state had any special resonance, Mr. Romney added, ''If I win in Michigan, then I become the president, and that would mean a lot to me personally.''
Mr. Romney also used his time in Michigan to address a rumor, first reported by ABC News, that had dogged him all day: that Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a favorite of conservative Republicans, was not being vetted as a possible vice-presidential pick. At the final stop, Mr. Romney held an impromptu meeting with a small group of reporters, where he called the initial story ''false.''
''Marco Rubio is being thoroughly vetted as part of our process,'' Mr. Romney said.
The Romney campaign is using the summer to take stock of the electoral map and decide in which states to invest its time and resources. So far, it has two basic categories: a first tier of traditional swing states and historically Republican states that Mr. Obama won four years ago, and a second tier of states like Michigan, which it says it believes Mr. Obama needs to win to retain the White House, but where it believes changing demographics provide it with an opportunity.
''The practical reality is there are better opportunities that will be at the top of the list, but I think Michigan will be a viable place to play and a viable option,'' said Saul Anuzis, a prominent Republican from Michigan. ''If Michigan is going to be a potential state in play, you have to play here. He realizes that, his team realizes that, and I think it would be a political mistake not to seriously take a look at Michigan.''
Or, as Katie Packer Gage, Mr. Romney's deputy campaign manager, put it, ''There's no road to the White House that doesn't go through Michigan for Barack Obama.''
When Mr. Romney visited the state for a Republican conference on Mackinac Island in September, he told reporters that he would not be sentimental about the state and would compete here only if he saw a real opportunity.
Four years ago, Mr. Romney began his first presidential bid here, but this year the state has been the site of some of his major gaffes -- a rally at Ford Field where he failed to fill most of the cavernous stadium and where he remarked that his wife, Ann, owns a couple of Cadillacs.
During the primary, he struggled with the state's conservative base, but pulled out a victory over Rick Santorum. ''There was a sense that the primary was to be survived, the general election is to be won,'' said an adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity in order to discuss the campaign's thinking more freely. ''In the campaign there was a sense that Michigan would be a better general election state than a primary state.''
Still, at a stop here on Tuesday, Mr. Romney acknowledged the long odds; Mr. Obama won the state with 57.4 percent of the vote in 2008.
''Now most people say that Michigan -- out of touch, out of reach for a Republican, no way a Republican can win,'' he said, before ticking down a list of Republican leaders in the state, including Gov. Rick Snyder, and adding, ''Look, I see Republicans having been elected in this state.''
Neither Mr. Romney nor Mr. Obama has advertised in the state since the general election campaign began, according to the Kantar Media Campaign Media Analysis Group, but Mr. Romney's campaign spent more than $2.5 million in Michigan during the primary contest. And outside Republican groups and pro-Romney ''super PACs'' have bought advertising time in the state to make it more competitive.
Other supporters of Mr. Romney also see reasons to be optimistic. Advisers say that the state has been hit hard by the recession and that his message of economic turnaround is likely to resonate with Reagan Democrats.
''He's clearly going after the blue-collar Reagan class Democrat who has been suffering for the past four years,'' Mr. Anuzis said. ''It's a very targeted strategic undertaking that he's doing, and I think it's working extremely effectively.''
Governor Snyder said Mr. Romney has a ''good opportunity'' to win the state, where the voters ''are really focused on the topic of jobs and getting the economy going.''
But the Obama campaign is sure to hammer away at Mr. Romney's opposition to the auto bailout, which the president got passed, helping to save the failing industry.
''This is a guy who loves cars, and I don't think you're going to convince the voters of Michigan that he doesn't care about the industry,'' Ms. Gage said. ''He's already forgotten more about cars and the American auto industry than anybody in the Obama administration will ever know.''
And, of course, a little hometown advantage never hurts. Waiting for Mr. Romney to take the stage here, Phyllis Hetherington wore two buttons: a tiny blue one from when George Romney ran for governor and a larger one for George's son Mitt.
''This man represents Romney the governor,'' she said, referring to Mitt Romney. ''The acorn doesn't fall far from the tree.''

HEADLINE: As Queens Looks to Fill a Congressional Seat, the Democratic Race Is Wide Open

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
Assemblywoman Grace Meng appreciates the support of the Queens Democratic machine, and the overwhelming financial advantage she enjoys over her opponents. But she emphasizes that she is the only candidate who has won before without her party's blessing.
Assemblyman Rory I. Lancman acknowledges that he can strike some as arrogant, even irritating. But he notes that none of his financial-reform legislation could have passed in Albany without bipartisan support. 
And City Councilwoman Elizabeth S. Crowley knows that politicos whisper that she lacks the intellectual horsepower to keep pace in Congress. But she brushes off such talk as elitist, and proudly promotes her working-class support from police officers, firefighters and construction workers.
In some ways, the major candidates vying in the Democratic primary next Tuesday in the Sixth Congressional District, which covers a diverse swath of central and eastern Queens, are all trying to prove that they are not what their reputations suggest.
After all, the candidates concede there are not major differences in their views on core issues like the economy, transportation and immigration. And they also know they cannot match the three decades of incumbency or the high name recognition of the retiring legislator they hope to replace, Representative Gary L. Ackerman.
So in a newly configured district, and anticipating a low-turnout election, the candidates are desperate to define who they are -- and who they are not.
Bruce N. Gyory, who teaches political science at the State University at Albany, said he was riveted by the contest, because he could not think of a Congressional primary for an open seat that was as wide open, or as perplexing, since Herman Badillo eked out a win over Peter F. Vallone Sr. in 1970.
''I don't think polling will be particularly helpful here,'' he said. ''I don't think speculation is helpful here. I don't see any reasonable prognostication about who will win. This is one that will be fascinating until you see the machines opened up Tuesday night.''
Turnout, everyone agrees, will be crucial, with perhaps 32,000 out of 186,000 registered Democrats expected to vote.
Ms. Meng, a fluent Mandarin speaker who has garnered much attention from the Asian-American media, needs a strong showing from Chinese, Korean and South Asian voters. Mr. Lancman, whose campaign believes he has the strongest field operation, is counting on support from Jewish and union voters, while Ms. Crowley, whose mailers have been praised as top-notch even by rival campaigns, is expected to run particularly well among white voters.
The winner of the primary election will most likely face Daniel J. Halloran III, a Republican member of the City Council, in the November general election.
The primary battle began in March, when Mr. Ackerman unexpectedly announced that he would not seek re-election. The Queens Democratic Party, led by its powerful chairman, Representative Joseph Crowley, tapped Ms. Meng, 36, to run; the reconfigured district is about 40 percent Asian-American, and if elected, she would be the first Asian-American member of Congress from New York.
But after Mr. Lancman, 43, announced that he would also seek the nomination, he picked up early momentum, collecting crucial endorsements from the Working Families Party, many unions and former Mayor Edward I. Koch. He also performed strongly in candidate debates.
Then came Ms. Crowley, 34, a cousin of Mr. Crowley. Despite speculation that she was a stalking-horse, urged by her cousin to siphon votes from Mr. Lancman, she insisted that she had contemplated running for higher office even before Mr. Ackerman announced his retirement.
There is also a fourth Democrat on the ballot, Dr. Robert Mittman, a libertarian-leaning family doctor, who has not attracted prominent endorsements or financial support.
In an interview, the low-key Ms. Meng vowed that she would be an independent force in Washington who would focus primarily on transportation, infrastructure and economic issues.
''When I'm drafting or supporting legislation, no one is whispering in my ear except constituents,'' she said. ''I've never had political rabbis.''
Mr. Lancman has vowed to focus on foreign policy and Wall Street reform in Washington, and has highlighted his legislative accomplishments, like helping homeowners recover legal fees in foreclosure cases. The most aggressive of the candidates, he sent out a mailer this week criticizing Ms. Meng and Ms. Crowley as being weak on counterterrorism.
''We all know there are Type A personalities, and maybe I'm a Type AA personality,'' he said. ''I will always be a very aggressive and prepared counterbalance to any of the crazy right-wing stuff that Republicans want to put forward.''
Ms. Crowley said she wanted to be a voice on women's health issues in Washington, and dreamed of extending the No. 7 train to La Guardia Airport. She scoffed at the notion that she was a ''spoiler'' candidate, saying that ''I guarantee I'm known better in my own district'' than her opponents are in theirs.
''If somebody tries to poke fun at me, I don't get distracted,'' she said. ''I always try to stay on message.''

HEADLINE: Setback in Talks on Iran's Nuclear Program in a 'Gulf of Mistrust'

BYLINE: By ELLEN BARRY and RICK GLADSTONE; Ellen Barry reported from Moscow, and Rick Gladstone from New York. Thomas Erdbrink contributed reporting from Tehran, Alan Cowell from London, and Artin Afkhami from New York.

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Talks on Iran's disputed nuclear program descended into mistrust and frustration in Moscow on Tuesday, casting doubt on whether the two sides can negotiate a way out of the escalating crisis.
After five draining sessions, the European Union foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, said the differences between Iran and the group of six world powers involved in the talks here remained so significant that negotiators did not commit to another high-level meeting. Instead, technical experts from both sides will convene early next month to determine whether there are grounds for further high-level contact.
The talks between Iran and the six powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia, the United States and Germany -- faced daunting obstacles from the outset. Iran has signaled some willingness to scale down its uranium enrichment, a process that can produce nuclear fuel but also the components of a nuclear bomb, and is being squeezed by new rounds of economic sanctions that will take effect on July 1. The sanctions threaten to isolate Tehran further from world oil markets and the international banking system. 
But Iran's central demand was a weighty one. It wants international recognition that it has the right to enrich uranium for what it claims are peaceful purposes. Western powers say they suspect Iran's intentions are to produce fuel for nuclear weapons, and domestic politics in both the United States and Iran all but excluded the chance that either side would accept big concessions.
''Assumptions of an easy breakthrough were premature because of the gulf of mistrust,'' said Vali R. Nasr, dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Washington.
''It was a success that talks have gone this far,'' Mr. Nasr said. ''The problem is that Iran is stuck in its position: it has to give up substantial things -- trump cards -- for talks to proceed substantively, and it needs serious concessions in return.'' But the six powers, he said, are ''not ready to give them.''
Negotiators from the so-called P5+1 group (the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany) said there was some heartening progress in Moscow, where Iranian negotiators for the first time delivered a detailed response to a set of proposals first presented to them at a meeting last month in Baghdad. A senior American official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the talks, said this had happened ''for the first time in many years.''
The set of proposals, known in diplomatic shorthand as ''stop, shut, ship,'' asked Iran to curtail enrichment of uranium to 20 percent purity, export its stockpile of the material and shut the underground facility where much of it is made. In response, the world powers said they would supply parts for old American civilian aircraft and fuel for an Iranian nuclear reactor, with the promise of more sanctions relief in return for specific Iranian actions over time.
Iran's response was a stream of criticism, delivered in exhaustive detail on Monday afternoon. At midday on Tuesday, the world powers put forward a scaled-down plan for future negotiations on technical matters. The afternoon and evening were spent wrangling over what those talks would cover, with Iran pushing for discussion of political matters.
''We are going to see whether Iran is ready to make the choices it needs to make,'' the American official said. ''We are not going to get trapped in a process that we think is not a productive one, so we're taking this step by step. The sanctions will be increasing, and we told the Iranians that there will be more pressure coming if this proceeds forward.''
Saeed Jalili, the lead Iranian negotiator, said, ''The characteristics of this talk, they were more serious, more realistic and way beyond just expressing the viewpoints and positions.''
But he reiterated Iran's basic position that its enrichment of uranium is nonnegotiable, and that ''there is no reason or excuse to have doubt regarding the peaceful aims of Iran's nuclear program.''
Russian officials, as the conference's hosts, met twice with the head of the Iranian delegation on Tuesday, in an evident attempt to keep the process from derailing.
There had been little expectation heading into the Moscow talks of a concession by either side. But after three high-level meetings led by Ms. Ashton and Mr. Jalili -- in Istanbul in April, Baghdad last month and now Moscow -- Iran experts said the inability of the negotiators to come up with something substantive was a setback.
''There is certainly a danger that the talks will collapse,'' said Alireza Nader, an Iran specialist at the RAND Corporation, a research group in Washington. He said some of the language from the Iranians reflected their own frustration with the talks, raising the possibility that ''at some point Iran may conclude that the talks are fruitless and that it won't get what it wants.''
At the same time, he said, the six powers want an Iranian compromise on uranium enrichment that will assuage doubts about its intentions.
''The sequencing appears to be a big problem here,'' Mr. Nader said. ''I wouldn't say the talks are pointless -- they should be continued. But I also fear the negotiations are on shaky ground.''
The lack of substantive progress in Moscow also appeared to reflect Iran's willingness to endure punishing economic sanctions imposed by the United States and European Union, with more onerous measures looming within weeks, that Obama administration officials have been hoping would force the Iranians to be more flexible.
According to a statement by Ms. Ashton, both sides agreed to further clarifications at the Istanbul meeting and technical studies of each other's positions, to be followed by contacts between the deputies of Ms. Ashton and Mr. Jalili. After that, Ms. Ashton said in the statement, ''I will then be directly in touch with Dr. Jalili about prospects for a future meeting at the political level.''
It was clear at the outset on Monday that the room for agreement was small. Iran has concentrated its efforts on an acknowledgment that it has the right under international treaties to enrich uranium. In exchange, Iran -- which has repeatedly asserted that its nuclear program is peaceful -- has signaled it may be willing to stop enriching uranium to 20 percent purity, considered a technical step short of bomb grade.
The six powers have demanded that Iran abide by prior Security Council resolutions to suspend all uranium enrichment. They also have demanded that the Iranians ship the 20 percent-enriched uranium out of the country and shut down an underground enrichment facility.
Israel, which considers Iran its most dangerous enemy, has warned that it may pre-emptively strike suspected Iranian nuclear targets if it decides that the talks are not making progress, an action that many fear would lead to a new Middle East war. That possibility is one of the chief underlying motivations for the P5+1 negotiators to make some progress.

HEADLINE: Political Memo: Obama Biography Brings New Scrutiny to President's Own Memoir

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
At Harvard Law School in 1990, President Obama found himself lovingly mocked by his peers for relentlessly promoting the exotic story of a search for racial identity that later became the theme of his best-selling book, ''Dreams From My Father.''
''My mother was a backup singer for Abba. They were good folks,'' a student parody of Mr. Obama joked. In Chicago, ''I discovered I was black, and I have remained so ever since.''
A presidential election victory 18 years later ushered Mr. Obama into the White House. But it also drew new attention to the stories he told in the book, written years before his presidential campaign. And as he runs for office again, there are new questions about how closely the president's telling of his life hews to reality. A new book by David Maraniss of The Washington Post claims to document the many ways - some very small, a few large - in which Mr. Obama's youthfully constructed narrative appears to be contradicted by the people and events in his life.
And the book, available Tuesday, follows reporting in The New York Times and elsewhere over the past half-dozen years that has sometimes called into question parts of Mr. Obama's life story. 
The president's memoir has long been the foundation of Mr. Obama's political biography. In 2008, it was one of two books that delivered a defining and searing narrative around which the men running for president built their political brands.
''Dreams From My Father'' portrayed Mr. Obama as a mixed-race young man raised without a father and struggling to find his racial identity. In ''Faith of My Fathers,'' John McCain was a brash young soldier struggling to live up to his father, becoming a hero along the way.
Mr. Obama's memoir - written at a time that the young man contemplated a career as an author - later became a hit among Mr. Obama's political groupies, who sometimes arrived at campaign events in 2008 clutching copies.
But the questions about Mr. Obama's book highlight the potential downside for politicians who document their lives as a way of introducing themselves to the American public. The claims in those memoirs are immediately targets for the kind of scrutiny that only comes during the intensity of a political campaign.
Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, is experiencing the phenomenon in hyper speed. His own autobiography is also available Tuesday, alongside a competing biography from a Washington Post reporter who dug up errors in the senator's stories about his Cuban parents.
The accuracy of Mr. Rubio's telling of his family history may be part of the calculation for Mitt Romney as the presumptive Republican nominee mulls whether to pick Mr. Rubio as his vice-presidential running mate.
But Mr. Obama has even more at stake as he returns to the campaign trail to ask for a second term in the White House. As Ben Smith of Buzzfeed.com noted over the weekend, the memoir was Mr. Obama's primary means of telling a ''simple, and ultimately optimistic story about race and identity in the 20th Century.''
Now, Republicans are poised to try and portray Mr. Obama as having been less than truthful in his recollections about his life. Party officials and aides to Mr. Romney's campaign are scouring Mr. Maraniss's book to find ways in which they can use it to their political advantage.
The new book by Mr. Maraniss suggests that the real story of Mr. Obama's life was less dramatic - and more routine - than the president made it out to be in the memoir.
In an interview Tuesday morning on MSNBC's ''Morning Joe'' program, Mr. Maraniss said the president did not set out to write a factual history of his life and was ''trying to see everything through a racial lens. That was the original purpose of that book.'' Mr. Maraniss added that ''I don't think it's a venal reason. I think it says more about a writer's pressures to try to tell a story than anything about his larger character.''
Mr. Maraniss attributes some of the differences to the kind of family lore that is often exaggerated. He notes that the story about the death of Mr. Obama's step-grandfather - allegedly killed while fighting Dutch troops in Indonesia - was ''a concocted myth in almost all respects.'' Mr. Maraniss writes that he died trying to hang drapes.
In other cases, Mr. Maraniss writes that Mr. Obama skipped over the more mundane parts of his upbringing to focus on the themes of race. One example was the role of basketball in the life of the young Mr. Obama, experiences which ''did not make his life odd or mysterious.''
Mr. Obama was upfront in his memoir that dialogue in the book was ''an approximation'' and that some of the characters in his book had been compressed or combined. But the specifics had remained mostly unknown. In his book, Mr. Maraniss documents several of the efforts by Mr. Obama to invent or alter characters to help his narrative.
The most dramatic was that of Mr. Obama's New York girlfriend. In the book by Mr. Maraniss, the president acknowledges that some of the events he describes as taking place with the New York girlfriend actually took place with another woman he dated in Chicago.
''Like many characters in the memoir, he introduced her to advance a theme, another thread of thought in his musings about race,'' Mr. Maraniss writes in the book.
The book by Mr. Maraniss, who is also the author of a biography about Bill Clinton, is not the first effort by journalists to examine Mr. Obama's telling of his own life story.
In 2008, Serge Kovaleski, a New York Times reporter, interviewed friends of Mr. Obama's from college and high school who questioned the scenes in Mr. Obama's memoir about smoking marijuana and trying cocaine as a youth.
''Friends, classmates and mentors from his high school and Occidental recalled Mr. Obama as being grounded, motivated and poised, someone who did not appear to be grappling with any drug problems and seemed to dabble only with marijuana,'' Mr. Kovaleski wrote.
Mr. Maraniss offers a third view, describing Mr. Obama as part of a ''choom gang,'' a group of high school basketball buddies in Hawaii who frequently smoked marijuana.
Last year, a former New York Times reporter, Janny Scott, wrote a book that raised questions about Mr. Obama's frequently mentioned story about his mother's battles with insurance companies at the end of her life.
''I will never forget my own mother, as she fought cancer in her final months, having to worry about whether her insurance would refuse to pay for her treatment,'' Mr. Obama said in 2009, as he campaigned for passage of his health care program.
Ms. Scott's research suggested that Mr. Obama's mother, Ann Dunham, was covered by health insurance at the time, and was instead denied disability coverage that would have helped to pay expenses that were not covered by insurance.
Aides to Mr. Obama last year said the book confirmed the basic facts of the stories that the president told about his mother, including the health care expenses that she struggled to pay.
The campaign for president this year is unlikely to turn on questions about Mr. Obama's memoir. Both presidential campaigns have said they believe the American people are focused on the country's struggling economic fortunes.
But at the very least, the publication of Mr. Maraniss's book less than five months before election day suggests that the president will face more questions about his personal narrative than he did four years ago.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Don't Shut the Golden Door

BYLINE: By JOHN M. MacDONALD and ROBERT J. SAMPSON. 
John M. MacDonald is an associate professor of criminology at the University of Pennsylvania. Robert J. Sampson is a professor of the social sciences at Harvard.

 BODY:
IMMIGRATION is in the headlines again, with President Obama's decision last week to stop deporting young illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children, and the Supreme Court's approaching decision on the constitutionality of Arizona's crackdown on undocumented migrants.
But too much of the public debate has focused on the legality of immigration without considering a more fundamental question: What effects has mass immigration had on American society? 
As a result of the 1965 immigration act, which opened the door widely to non-European immigrants, 40 million foreign-born immigrants now live in the United States. They make up 13 percent of the population, the largest such proportion since the 1920s. More than half of these migrants are from Latin America and the Caribbean, although a study released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center found that Asians overtook Hispanics in 2009 as the fastest-growing group of immigrants.
For the May issue of the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, we commissioned some of the most meticulous research done to date about the effects of immigration on a cross section of American communities -- urban, suburban and rural.
The scholars who participated were in remarkable agreement: while new immigrants are poorer than the general population and face considerable hardship, there is no evidence that they have reshaped the social fabric in harmful ways.
America is neither less safe because of immigration nor is it worse off economically. In fact, in the regions where immigrants have settled in the past two decades, crime has gone down, cities have grown, poor urban neighborhoods have been rebuilt, and small towns that were once on life support are springing back.
Scholars can't say for sure that immigration caused these positive developments, but we know enough to debunk the notion that immigrants worsen social ills.
For example, in rural counties that experienced an influx of immigrants in the 1980s and '90s, crime rates dropped by more than they did in rural counties that did not see high immigrant growth. Higher immigration was associated with reductions in homicide rates for white, black and Latino victims. In both Hazleton, Pa., which has a recent history of hostility toward immigration, and St. James, Minn., a much more welcoming community, migrants have also bolstered dwindling populations and helped to reverse economic decline.
In large gateway cities, immigration has been associated not only with a decrease in crime but also with economic revitalization and reductions in concentrated poverty. Data from the 2005 American Community Survey showed, for example, that the income of blacks in the New York City borough of Queens surpassed that of whites for the first time, a development driven largely by immigration from the West Indies.
Scholars found that immigrant youths in Los Angeles were involved in less crime and violence than their native-born peers in similar economic circumstances. Research also has shown that an increase in immigration in cities like San Antonio and Miami did not produce an increase in the homicide rate. Furthermore, social scientists found that people in immigrant communities in New York were less cynical about the law than were people in less diverse communities; they were also more likely to indicate that they would cooperate with the police.
If migration has had such beneficial effects, why, then, has there been such a persistent backlash?
Part of the answer surely lies in the social changes -- language, political attitudes, religious mores -- that immigrants bring, in addition to the effects of the recession. The leveling-off of migration, especially from Mexico, may bring a sense of relief to opponents of these social changes, but if the new research is any guide, the consequences of the slowdown may be the opposite of what the critics intend.
Comprehensive immigration reform -- last attempted during the second term of President George W. Bush -- should be a priority for whoever wins in November. Mr. Obama's decision to exempt undocumented children who were brought to the United States by their parents from harsh deportation rules is an overdue, but welcome, first step.
Establishing a clear path to citizenship for undocumented adults, creating a more permissive guest-worker program, reducing unwarranted police stops of immigrants and preserving families rather than separating them through deportation are controversial ideas, but they deserve a hearing.

HEADLINE: Layoffs Hitting Public Workers; Recovery Is Hurt

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN and MOTOKO RICH

 BODY:
Companies have been slowly adding workers for more than two years. But pink slips are still going out in a crucial area: government.
In California, the governor is threatening to eliminate 15,000 state jobs. When school begins in Cleveland this fall, more than 500 teachers probably will be out of work. And in Trenton -- which has already cut a third of its police force, hundreds of school district employees and at least 150 other public workers -- the only way the city will forestall the loss of 60 more firefighters is if a federal grant comes through.
Government payrolls grew in the early part of the recovery, largely because of federal stimulus measures. But since its postrecession peak in April 2009 (not counting temporary Census hiring), the public sector has shrunk by 706,000 jobs. The losses appeared to be tapering off earlier this year, but have accelerated for the last three months, creating the single biggest drag on the recovery in many areas.
With the economy expanding, albeit slowly, state tax revenues have started to recover and are estimated to exceed prerecession levels next year. Yet governors and legislatures are keeping a tight rein on spending, whether to refill depleted rainy-day funds or because of political inclination. 
At the same time, costs for health care, social services, pensions and education are still rising. Fourteen states plan to resolve their budget gaps by reducing aid to local governments, according to a report by the National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers.
So while the federal government has grown a little since the recession, and many states have recently begun to add a few jobs, local governments are making new cuts that outweigh those gains. More than a quarter of municipal governments are planning layoffs this year, according to a survey by the Center for State and Local Government Excellence. They are being squeezed not only by declining federal and state support, but by their devastated property tax base.
''The unfortunate reality is our revenue streams have not rebounded,'' said Timothy R. Hacker, the city manager of North Las Vegas, which has cut its work force to 1,300 from 2,300 and is about to lay off 130 more. ''Shaking this recession is becoming increasingly difficult.''
Pennsylvania, for example, has shed 5,400 government jobs this year, and many school districts and social service agencies are contemplating more layoffs. ''We have slipped to the middle of the pack in terms of job growth,'' said Mark Price, a labor economist at the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center. ''And that was driven mainly by the fact that we lost so many jobs in the public sector.''
Public workers became a point of contention in the presidential campaign recently when Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, criticized President Obama for wanting to increase the number of government employees through stimulus measures. ''He says we need more firemen, more policemen, more teachers,'' Mr. Romney said, adding: ''It's time for us to cut back on government and help the American people.''
Mr. Obama has made the counterargument that during past recessions the government sector has grown, rather than shrunk. The White House later said he meant recessions and the recoveries that followed.
''Each time there was a recession with a Republican president,'' he said, ''we compensated by making sure that government didn't see a drastic reduction in employment.''
If governments still employed the same percentage of the work force as they did in 2009, the unemployment rate would be a percentage point lower, according to an analysis by Moody's Analytics. At the pace so far this year, layoffs will siphon off $15 billion in spending power. Yale economists have said that if state and local governments had followed the pattern of previous recessions, they would have added at least 1.4 million jobs.
Conservatives have argued that the government was bloated after a hiring surge during the housing boom and is now returning to a more appropriate size. Michael D. Tanner, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, criticized the president's budget proposal to give states an additional $30 billion for teachers, police officers and firefighters. ''Those new public sector jobs must be paid for with more debt and taxes borne by the private sector,'' he wrote.
But those with disappearing jobs say that the effects are not just economic -- they mean longer response times to fires, larger class sizes, and in some cases lawsuits when short-staffed agencies are unable to provide the required services.
After 32 firefighters were laid off in Muncie, Ind., the area that could be reached within eight minutes was cut by half, said Mike Whited, the president of the firefighters union. A federal grant restored 25 workers, but the city does not know if it will be renewed.
Mr. Whited chafed at portrayals of public workers as overpaid or greedy, saying his union and others had made concessions, including paying more for their health insurance and forfeiting raises. ''I think a lot of people don't understand what we do,'' he said. ''They're looking for somebody to blame, and I think they're being led the wrong way.''
Businesses can also be hindered by government cuts. They not only lose prospective middle-class customers but may face long waits for services. Roland Pott, a real estate broker and developer in Trenton, said that fewer city inspectors adds to construction delays. And the shortage of police officers means he must assuage the safety concerns of prospective tenants. ''It makes it harder to lease a space or market a space because people are choosing between Trenton or another area,'' he said.
Even if the overall economy improves, local governments are likely to lag behind. Property tax receipts, which are projected to fall slightly in 2012, ''will be weak through at least fiscal 2014,'' wrote Daniel White, an economist at Moody's Analytics, in a report this month. ''As a result, local government fiscal conditions will remain under pressure.''
Jobs in education have accounted for more than half the losses in local governments. Teachers and other school employees continue to receive layoff notices in California, Colorado, Nevada and Ohio, among others. In Los Angeles, about 11,700 teachers and others were notified in the spring. On Saturday, the teachers union ratified an agreement to save more than 4,000 jobs by taking furlough days.
To close a $64 million budget gap, the district in Clark County, Nevada, which encompasses Las Vegas, sent layoff notices to 400 teachers this month and will not fill 600 openings.
In Cleveland, the school district cited a $66 million budget deficit when announcing the layoff of more than 500 teachers this spring. David Quolke, president of the Cleveland Teachers Union, said it followed two years of cutbacks and $25 million in concessions from the union. He said that some classes would have more than 40 children.
Kimili Gulley, 32, has been teaching middle and high school math for nine years and expected her tenure to provide protection. But this month, she too is out of work. ''So much emphasis is put on educating kids,'' she said, ''and yet funding is getting cut when it comes to educating kids. So it's kind of hypocritical.''

HEADLINE: The Other Rivals: Fact and Interpretation

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
To listen to Mitt Romney tell it, President Obama is a job-killing, free-spending, big-government liberal who made the recession worse with his policies and endangered free-market capitalism. The president has spent tax dollars ''at a pace without precedent in recent history,'' Mr. Romney says, and ''added almost as much debt as all the prior presidents combined.''
As Mr. Obama travels the country, he offers the opposite self-portrait, that of a job-creating, tightfisted, government-shrinking pragmatist who saved the country from another Great Depression. On his watch, ''government employment has gone down,'' he says, and federal spending has increased ''at the lowest pace in nearly 60 years.''
With the presidential race largely focused on the economy and the budget, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are filling speeches with facts and figures designed to enhance their case and diminish the other guy's, in the process often making assertions fundamentally at odds with one another. Along the way, both candidates are at times stretching the truth, using statistics without context, exaggerating their own records and misrepresenting their opponent's. 
Each side regularly accuses the other of lying, and in any campaign there is a temptation to write both sides off, as if every misleading statement were equivalent. In reality, some are more fundamental than others, more egregious, more central to the larger argument. Mr. Romney, for example, called his 2010 book laying out the rationale for his candidacy ''No Apology'' -- charging, falsely in the eyes of many independent fact-checkers, that Mr. Obama had traveled the world apologizing for America.
But determining who is the worse dissembler can be a subjective exercise, even in an age when news organizations, blogs and partisan groups blitz out regular fact-checks. When PolitiFact, the Pulitzer-winning project of The Tampa Bay Times, evaluated the statements, it found that more of Mr. Romney's were misleading than Mr. Obama's. Glenn Kessler, who writes the Fact Checker column at The Washington Post, on the other hand, has awarded roughly the same average ''Pinocchio scores'' -- his measure of falsity -- to both men.
Sometimes the truth or dishonesty of an assertion depends on definitions or on when you start counting. When it comes to unemployment, for instance, Mr. Romney counts from the month when Mr. Obama took office and inherited an economy that was hemorrhaging jobs at historic rates. Mr. Obama prefers to count from 2010, when his policies arguably had started to take effect and the job picture had begun turning around, eschewing blame for the losses at the start of his term.
But one thing is clear: While they claim distance from typical Washington politics, both men have mastered the ancient Washington art of selective storytelling.
Job Creation
''Over 4 million jobs created in the last two years.'' -- Mr. Obama
''He has not created jobs.'' -- Mr. Romney
Nowhere is the veracity of the candidates' statements more central than on the economic issues at the heart of their contest. The question of job creation provides a quintessential case study. By counting from January 2009, Mr. Romney paints the bleak portrait of a country that despite a modest recovery still has fewer jobs than it did when Mr. Obama took office. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the country has 552,000 fewer jobs now than when the president was inaugurated.
Mr. Obama starts his count in March 2010, after the money from his stimulus law was flowing and payrolls began growing again. And he generally cites private-sector employment, so that he can say 4.3 million jobs have been created. Counting government work forces, the job growth is actually lower, 3.8 million jobs, according to the bureau.
Is it reasonable to start counting in January 2009? The economy was already shedding hundreds of thousands of jobs a month, and none of Mr. Obama's policies would take effect for some time. Starting the count just one month later would show a small net increase in jobs for the president's tenure in office. Yet if he cannot be blamed for job losses in the early months of his term, can Mr. Obama be held responsible for not replacing the lost jobs more quickly?
Federal Debt
Mr. Obama has ''added almost as much debt as all the prior presidents combined.'' -- Mr. Romney
The total national debt now stands at $15.8 trillion, up from $10.6 trillion when Mr. Obama took office, an increase of nearly 50 percent. A commonly cited and more economically important subset, debt held by the public, has grown to $11 trillion from $6.3 trillion, a 75 percent increase -- closer to Mr. Romney's claim, but still $1.7 trillion short of matching the accumulated public debt of the first 43 presidents. Adjusted for inflation, the debt Mr. Obama incurred is smaller relative to the combined prior debt.
Federal Spending
''Since President Obama assumed office...federal spending has accelerated at a pace without precedent in recent history.'' -- Mr. Romney
''Since I've been president, federal spending has risen at the lowest pace in nearly 60 years.'' -- Mr. Obama
Both men may be exaggerating in their own ways -- and once again it depends in part on when you start counting. The president based his claim on a column in Market Watch, which calculated that government spending during the Obama years has grown 1.4 percent annually, the lowest since President Dwight D. Eisenhower.
But that column started counting with the fiscal year that started on Oct. 1, 2009, more than eight months after Mr. Obama took office, on the theory that that was the first full fiscal year Mr. Obama could shape. It held Mr. Obama responsible for $140 billion in additional spending from those first eight months stemming largely from his stimulus spending program. The calculation also gave Mr. Obama credit for automatic spending cuts scheduled for the next fiscal year, which the president opposes and which may not actually take effect.
Using different ways to calculate spending, The Washington Post found that spending has been going up 5.2 percent a year under Mr. Obama, while The Associated Press put the figure at 3 percent, excluding 2009. Either way, it is neither the ''lowest pace in nearly 60 years,'' as Mr. Obama claimed, nor ''at a pace without precedent in recent history,'' as Mr. Romney charged.
Going back to Eisenhower, federal spending has risen on average 7 percent a year, or 2.6 percent when adjusted for inflation. After the spending burst of 2009, Mr. Obama, constrained by Congress and aided by repayments of bank and auto bailouts, increased spending just 0.5 percent a year over the next three fiscal years when adjusted for inflation; only two other three-year periods since Eisenhower had lower spending growth.
Another way to judge spending is to look at what was anticipated based on the laws and policies at the time Mr. Obama took office versus what actually happened. In January 2009, days before he was inaugurated, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office forecast spending in the 2011 fiscal year, which ended last Sept. 30, at $3.323 trillion. In reality, after the policies put in place by Mr. Obama and Congress, it turned out to be $3.603 trillion, 8.4 percent higher.
Yet another way to look at spending is as a share of the overall economy. For years up to and through most of George W. Bush's presidency, federal spending generally totaled about 20 percent or less of the nation's overall economic output. In Mr. Bush's final full fiscal year in office, ending Sept. 30, 2008, it rose to 20.8 percent.
The next fiscal year, in which Mr. Bush was president for four months and Mr. Obama for eight, it shot up to 25.2 percent, then dipped to 24.1 percent for each of the next two years, the highest levels since World War II. Of course one reason spending is a larger share of the economy is because the overall economy shrunk during the recession. But even if spending rose starkly during the economic crisis under the presidencies of both Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama, it has remained at the higher level since then under Mr. Obama.
Size of Government
''The only time government employment has gone down during a recession has been under me.'' -- Mr. Obama
Again, it depends on how it is counted. Looking at the five months from Mr. Obama's inauguration to June 2009, when the recession officially ended, and including state and local governments, which are not under his direct control, government employment at all levels was virtually unchanged, from 22,576,000 in January 2009 to 22,570,000 in June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
Total government employment was 21,969,000 in May 2012, a reduction of about 600,000 jobs. But looking only at the federal work force under Mr. Obama's direct control, then government employment has actually gone up. He inherited a federal work force of 2,061,700, and it rose slightly through June 2009 to 2,109,700; by May of this year, it had grown further to 2,204,100, a 7 percent increase.
Mr. Obama is not correct in saying this was the ''only time'' government shrank during a recession. During the recession from July 1981 through November 1982, under President Ronald Reagan, and again during the recession from July 1990 through March 1991, under the elder President George Bush, government employment shrank slightly, both over all and in the federal work force specifically. The White House said he meant the recession and the 35 months after it.
Either way, while Mr. Obama has boasted of shrinking the public work force, he has advocated policies to prevent it from shrinking by helping state and local governments avoid laying off employees. In recent days, he has lamented that continuing economic troubles result in part from a decreasing public work force.
Economics
''We are only inches away from no longer being a free economy.'' -- Mr. Romney
In attacking Mr. Obama's stewardship of the economy, Mr. Romney has engaged in hyperbole at times -- as with this claim. He has also contended that Mr. Obama made the recession ''worse'' and ''last longer'' and said that the president's health care law would increase government spending to nearly half of the American economy.
There is plenty of debate over how effective Mr. Obama's economic policies have been, especially given the painfully slow recovery, but economists do not generally claim that Mr. Obama's policies worsened the recession or made it longer.
The 18-month recession officially ended in June 2009, five months into Mr. Obama's term, as measured by the National Bureau of Economic Research. And even critics who consider the president's stimulus package a missed opportunity -- from liberals who say it was too small to conservatives who say it was wasteful and poorly targeted -- tend to acknowledge what the Congressional Budget Office has found: it did save and create jobs, lower unemployment and help the economy grow in the short term.
Despite Mr. Romney's claim, the new health care law will not drive government spending up to half of the economy, unless all health care spending in the country is reclassified as government spending. Given that the new law still relies heavily on private insurance provided by employers, it is a stretch to treat all of that as if it were government expenditures.
Experts predict the new health care law will drive up health spending, as more people will be covered, but not by a huge share of the economy. The chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimated that with the new law, health care spending will rise to 21 percent of the economy in 2019. Without the new law, it estimated, it would have risen to 20.8 percent of the economy.
The Congressional Budget Office recently estimated what would happen to federal spending under a number of different situations, taking the new health care law into account. The projection showing the biggest jump found that assuming that a number of current tax cuts are extended and several budget cuts currently scheduled to take effect next year are averted, federal spending will rise to 29 percent of the economy in 2030 from 24 percent in 2011. But that rise is attributable in large part to rising interest payments required by ballooning debt.
And the idea that the United States has almost ceased to be a free-market economy was labeled ''ridiculously false'' by PolitiFact, which cited an economic freedom index (from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group, which ranks the United States the world's 10th freest economy of 179 judged.
Tax Cuts
''A record surplus was squandered on tax cuts for people who didn't need them and weren't even asking for them.'' -- Mr. Obama
Mr. Obama makes it sound as if the surpluses projected at the end of President Bill Clinton's tenure disappeared entirely because of Mr. Bush's tax cuts. In fact, tax cuts for the wealthy were responsible for a small fraction of the disappearing surpluses.
An analysis by the Congressional Budget Office last year showed that of $5.6 trillion in surpluses projected over 10 years when Mr. Bush took office, $1.6 trillion went to the tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003, or 29 percent. The rest of the anticipated surpluses vanished because of increased spending and lower-than-expected revenues stemming from economic downturns.
Mr. Obama supports keeping the tax cuts for all but the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans, or roughly 18 percent of the total cost. Extrapolated, that means the tax cuts ''for people who didn't need them'' would have accounted for just 5 percent of the disappearing surpluses.

HEADLINE: Amid Debt Crisis, Overseas Buyers Seek European Companies

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: So far this year, the total value of mergers and acquisitions on the Continent by foreign companies has reached $101 billion, well ahead of the combined $73 billion spent in the United States by international suitors. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Europe's capital markets are in the doldrums. Uncertainty caused by the Continent's financial crisis has led to a big fall in initial public offerings, while investors remain wary of buying sovereign and company debt.
Yet there's one area where Europe is shining.
So far this year, the total value of mergers and acquisitions on the Continent by foreign companies has reached $101 billion, well ahead of the combined $73 billion spent in the United States by international acquirers, according to the data provider Dealogic.
While the total value of European deals this year has slipped 20 percent compared with the same period in 2011, the number of acquisitions by foreign suitors is back to the levels at the height of the financial boom in the mid-2000s. In contrast, the value of deals in the United States by foreign companies announced so far this year is still 50 percent less than the $144 billion recorded over the same period in 2007. 
As the European debt crisis has been felt across capital markets, the asset prices of many local companies have tumbled. Analysts say this fall in equity values has made some Europe companies takeover targets for overseas companies. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which comprises the largest companies in the euro zone, has fallen 20 percent over the last 12 months.
Faced with economic tumult, the Continent's companies have been looking to offload assets to shore up their capital reserves. Local banks are keen to sell so-called noncore assets, like real estate loan portfolios, while industrial companies have been mulling the disposal of international units.
American companies have been taking advantage. Acquirers in the United States have spent a combined $43.7 billion on deals in Europe so far this year, or around 43 percent of the total value of takeovers on the Continent. If Canadian companies are included, North American companies represent just under 60 percent of the buyers of European targets.
On Tuesday, the American drugstore chain Walgreen Company agreed to buy a 45 percent stake in Alliance Boots, the European pharmacy retailer, for $6.7 billion, in a deal that will allow both companies to extend their worldwide reach. United Parcel Service also is acquiring TNT Express, a Dutch shipping company, for 5.2 billion euros, or $6.6 billion.
Despite the increase in deals, bankers say acquirers remain cautious about what acquisitions to pursue. So-called bolt-on deals in the same industry that have minimal risk connected to them have become the main focus of attention. Transformational deals into new sectors, which involve large amounts of debt financing and concerns about how successful they will be, face tough opposition. 
Unlike acquisitions in the United States, which are focused in the healthcare, technology and food and beverage industries, deals for European companies are spread across a number sectors. Traditional takeover targets, like mining companies and energy utilities, remain popular, but other sectors, including telecoms and construction, also have recorded high volumes of deal activity, as international buyers look to take advantage of Europe's financial woes.

HEADLINE: Making Sense of New E.E.O.C. Rules on Hiring

BYLINE: ROBB MANDELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Is a candy company that gives tours to children taking a risk if it does not hire criminals? 

 BODY:
Second chances come up often when you talk to business owners on the record about hiring people who have served time - the subject, indirectly, of a just-published Times story about the new rules from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that may limit using criminal records in hiring decisions. Joseph Dutra, who employs 23 people at Kimmie Candy Company in Reno, Nev., is willing to give somebody with a criminal history a second chance, provided the crime didn't include violence or a sexual advance on a child. "We don't have a blanket policy here, but we need to have people with good morals, who are compatible with the public that we bring in," said Mr. Dutra, who added that groups of schoolchildren often tour the factory. "We're trying to make this a fun little place where people can come and feel safe."
The new E.E.O.C. policy warns companies that they may be violating discrimination laws if they do not tailor a ban on hiring people with criminal records narrowly to the open job, and it's not clear that Mr. Dutra's concern for visiting children would pass the agency test of nexus. It's possible, for example, that some jobs at the company do not involve any, or enough, contact with children to justify what is in fact a blanket ban of a sort. But Mr. Dutra is not moved by such distinctions. 
"When you have a small company like ours," he said, "the management has to hire people that they're going to work with on a daily basis, and everybody here wants to have a feeling of safety. It's just a worry that I would prefer not to have." Nor is he interested in hiring serial offenders, even if the crime is unrelated to the job. "If somebody has done it once, people make mistakes in life, I understand that, but if you find a person who's been convicted three or four times for the same thing, would I hire him here? No, because they would not have proven that they are rehabilitated. The government has good intentions, probably, to try and get criminals or ex-criminals into the work force. But in this kind of economy, where we're trying to figure out how to be successful and grow, small businesses should not have the burden of having somebody sue you because he has a criminal record and didn't fit in our company."
Privately, of course, some business owners have a less charitable view of the government's intentions, and of the way the E.E.O.C. operates, which they complain is an opportunity for angry ex-employees to exact revenge, though at a glacial pace. Still, most charges brought to the E.E.O.C. by employees are resolved in favor of the employer - which could reflect either the spuriousness of the charges or the difficulty in proving them, or perhaps both. Between 2008 and 2011, the commission received between 90,000 and 100,000 complaints of discrimination each year from aggrieved employees. In 2011, the agency resolved 112,499 complaints, including cases opened in previous years and cases transferred from other agencies. In two-thirds of those cases, the E.E.O.C. found no evidence of discrimination. (In the legal language, these are called findings of "no reasonable cause.") Another 16 percent of cases were closed for administrative reasons, oftentimes after charging employees failed to respond to the commission or simply disappeared.
In all, only about 18 percent were resolved in favor of the employee, and resulted in payments totaling $365 million. But only in a little more than a fifth of these cases (or four percent of all resolutions) did the Commission find "reasonable cause."* Rather, most of these so-called "merit resolutions" involve settlements, or instances where employees drop the case in exchange for benefits. But the lawyers interviewed in the story said that these outcomes shouldn't necessarily reflect vindication for the employee. "The E.E.O.C. investigators regularly try to settle cases before they are fully investigated, as a means of clearing backlog off the books," said Laurence E. Stuart, a labor lawyer based in Houston who represents companies before the E.E.O.C. "Likewise, withdrawals with benefits are not always based on merit. It is almost always cheaper to settle a marginal case than it is for the company to stand its ground and litigate the matter." Mr. Stuart said that in his experience, legal fees for E.E.O.C. complaints typically cost a company between $2,500 and $15,000.
Mr. Dutra, for his part, insisted that E.E.O.C.'s new guidelines would not change his hiring practices. "I still would have those standards for my company," he said. "Now, would I advertise that I did that? No. But I think most small businesses, if they have a preference on hiring somebody, no matter what the government says, they're going to figure how to hire the people they want to hire."
*Interestingly, in two out of three cases where the E.E.O.C. found evidence of discrimination in 2011, the agency's effort to bring employer and employee together ("conciliation") failed, and brought no remedy at all to the aggrieved employee. The E.E.O.C. can then sue these recalcitrant companies, but is reluctant to do so - it typically takes only about 10 percent of these companies to court.

HEADLINE: Asset Purchases Work, at Least a Little

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: Studies show that the Fed really can lower interest rates by purchasing large quantities of Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities, or other kinds of securities. 

 BODY:
4:26 p.m. | Updated This seems like a good day for a reminder that asset purchases work. The Federal Reserve really can lower interest rates by purchasing large quantities of Treasury securities, mortgage-backed securities, or other kinds of securities.
We know this because the Fed has run the experiment three times in recent years, and the results have been parsed, dissected and replicated by a growing number of certified economists, almost all of whom have reached the same basic conclusion.
And because other central banks have done the same thing, with the same results. 
Many Fed watchers expect the central bank to announce another program of asset purchases Wednesday at 12:30 p.m., for reasons I explained in Monday's paper. [Update: Indeed, the Fed did so.]
So here's a review of recent evidence on the value of asset purchases.

A paper published last month by two Federal Reserve Board economists estimated that the Fed's first two rounds of asset purchases reduced interest rates on 10-year Treasury bonds by about one percentage point. A number of earlier studies based on different methodologies have located the impact in the same ballpark. The Bank of Canada published a good overview of that growing body of research last year.
There are some important caveats, however. It appears that asset purchases have the largest impact when financial markets are frozen, so the Fed would need to buy larger quantities of securities to replicate the impact of its earlier purchases.
There is also disagreement about the magnitude of the economic impact. Lower interest rates don't directly benefit people and businesses that cannot qualify for loans. A 2010 study by economists at the Boston Fed found that the first round of purchases contributed to a surge in refinancing activity among those with good credit, but no increase in home purchase loans and uncertain benefits for the broader economy.
A more recent study, published in December 2011 by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, found that the second round of Fed asset purchases -- $600 billion in Treasury securities - most likely had a moderate but enduring impact on economic output, "unlikely to exceed half a percentage point."
It's fair to note that the Fed itself has conducted much of this research, which is somewhat akin to pharmaceutical companies' financing drug trials. They care enough to do the work because they have an interest in the outcome.
Some outside economists have reached less supportive conclusions. A paper published last month by Jonathan H. Wright, an economist at Johns Hopkins University, found that interest rates fell when the Fed announced its programs, but that the effect only lasted for a few months.
"A possible - although optimistic -- interpretation is that the economic stimulus provided by these Federal Reserve actions caused the economy to pick up," Professor Wright wrote in the paper. "Another interpretation is that markets initially overreacted to the news of these quantitative easing actions."
He concluded, "Unconventional monetary policy at the zero bound has had a stimulative effect on the economy, but it might have been quite modest."

HEADLINE: Driving the 2013 Lexus ES 300h

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI


HIGHLIGHT: Jim Motavalli gets acquainted with the first ES hybrid in the 23-year history of the model. 

 BODY:
SHORT HILLS, N.J. -- There have been five generations of the ES sedan since its introduction in 1989, and more than one million remain on the world's roads. But the model never was available with a hybrid powertrain until this, the ES 300h, was introduced at the New York auto show in April.
Lexus dealers will begin taking delivery of the ES 300h in August.
With an E.P.A.-certified combined fuel economy rating of 40 miles per gallon and a seamlessly delivered 200 horsepower from its four-cylinder Atkinson cycle engine, the sedan could be fairly read as a have-cake-and-eat-it-too proposition. Pricing, which won't be released until closer to the sale date, may be the most important determinant of the car's adoption by customers. The nonhybrid ES has moved further out of the entry-level luxury segment with each redesign. But at a drive event for the news media held in this affluent tristate suburb on Tuesday, Brian A. Smith, vice president of marketing for Lexus, said the premium that would be levied on the buyers of the hybrid, versus the nonhybrid ES 350, would be "the lowest in our lineup."
The styling differences between the ES 350 and the hybrid are minor; a discreet rear spoiler and hidden exhaust pipes are among the few telltale signs of the hybrid. Both cars have a 0.27 coefficient of drag, approaching the territory of the Toyota Prius, the volume-leading hybrid for Toyota, the parent of Lexus. The ES has a thrusting prow with deeply recessed fog lights and, in between, the two-tiered "spindle grille" that Lexus committed to with redesigns of the ES as well as the GS sports sedan.
The bolder elements of the ES's front end do not carry over so well to the interior, where the spindle is echoed as a frame around audio and climate controls. The look is squared off and angular, a misplaced nod to the 1980s, rather than aggressive or elegant. That said, optional bamboo wood accents, aligned with the sustainable image projected by the hybrid, are a nice touch, especially for a sedan certified by California as a super-ultra-low-emissions vehicle.
Passengers front and rear are well accommodated, but hybrid customers sacrifice roughly three cubic feet of trunk space to the car's 1.6-kilowatt-hour nickel-metal-hydride battery pack.
On the suburban roads and parkways where I drove the ES 300h, the car was responsive, especially when using the the dash-mounted selector to dial in the more robust throttle and steering response of the Sport mode. That selection also switches the hybrid power monitor to a tachometer. Eco mode emphasizes fuel economy, but response was still respectable, while E.V. mode permits electric-only runs over a maximum distance of 1.5 miles, provided the driver doesn't exceed 25 m.p.h.
Steering felt nicely weighted, and though the ES 350 entered a corner with a touch more alacrity than the hybrid, the ES 300h did not feel noticeably heavier. Toyota says the hybrid system adds only 130 pounds to the ES's curb weight.
Of electronics that may come to irk some drivers, I'd add the highly sensitive lane-departure alert system, which emits a rather insistent beep. Some drivers may want to deactivate it, which is possible, but it could be a lifesaver for drivers prone to drowsiness behind the wheel. There's also a blind-spot monitor and a rear-cross traffic alert.
The success of the ES 300h is not a foregone conclusion. Lexus's best-selling hybrid is the RX crossover, priced from $46,785. At the lower end is the CT200h at $29,995. The HS 250h, based on the Japanese-market Sai (sold as the Avensis in other markets), was a slow seller and was discontinued for the 2013 model year. The ES 300h could be saddled with the accusation that it's a Toyota Camry Hybrid in fancier dress, but given its thoughtful and surprisingly stylish execution, at least the ES 300h shouldn't suffer the ignominious fate of the HS 250h.

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
President Obama and world leaders pronounced themselves united in the effort to increase growth in the global economy on Tuesday, but appeared to make only modest headwayin persuading Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to drop her opposition to more government spending to alleviate Europe's debt crisis, Helene Cooper writes. The meeting did, however, appear to foreshadow a move toward deeper banking integration in Europe.

        
Along the campaign trail, both President Obama and Mitt Romney are at times stretching the truth, using statistics without context, exaggerating their own records and misrepresenting their opponents, Peter Baker and Michael Cooper report. But determining who is the worse dissembler can be a subjective exercise, even in an age when news organizations, blogs and partisan groups are fact-checking their every word. The reporters offer their own assessment of the accuracy of the facts and figures often cited by the candidates.

        
President Obama is promoting his unmatched record in prosecuting leaks, even though the crackdown has nothing to do with any directive from the president, Scott Shane and Charlie Savage report. Instead, it was unplanned, resulting from several leftover investigations from the Bush administration.

        
The Romney campaign believes that Michigan is up for grabs in November, even though President Obama carried the state in 2008, Ashley Parker writes. Mr. Romney's most recent dip into Michigan serves as a good test run in a state that at worst will force Mr. Obama and the Democrats to spend time and money that they would prefer to deploy elsewhere.

        
A farm bill that would fundamentally change the nation's food and agriculture policy had about 300 proposed amendments, covering a range of issues unrelated to agriculture, Ron Nixon reports. After Senate leaders reached an agreement to consider only 73 of the proposed changes, senators began working their way through the list on Tuesday, approving some of the amendments and and rejecting others.

        
A new biography, "Barack Obama: The Story," claims to document the many ways - some very small, a few large - in which President Obama's memoir, "Dreams From My Father," appears to be contradicted by the people and events in his life, Michael D. Shear reports. The questions about Mr. Obama's book highlight the potential downside of memoirs from politicians; the assertions in those books are immediately targets for the kind of scrutiny that comes only during the intensity of a political campaign.
Around the Web

        
A new service called Chirpify will allow users to tweet contributions to political campaigns, Politico reports. "There's no shopping cart, no check-out process. You can simply tweet money," said Chris Teso, Chirpify's founder and chief executive.
Happenings in Washington

        
The House oversight committee will convene at 10 a.m. to consider whether to hold Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. in contempt of Congress.
        
The Federal Reserve Board is expected to issue a statement on the economy at 12:30, followed by a news conference by its chairman, Ben Bernanke, at 2 p.m..
        
The White House Council on Women and Girls will celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Title IX program, which aims to end gender discrimination in sports and educational programs. Valerie Jarrett, senior adviser to the president, is expected to attend.

        
The National Grocers Association will hold its first ever National Best Bagger Congressional Competition, pitting the 2012 national grocery bagging champion against her hometown Representative, Reid Ribble, Republican of Wisconsin.

TOP STORIES 
Dimon, Testifying Before House, Stays on Message | Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, tussled with lawmakers on Tuesday in his second showdown in Washington since JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, disclosed a multibillion-dollar trading loss.
At a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, members peppered Mr. Dimon, once considered Washington's favorite banker, with pointed questions about the bank's aggressive lobbying, its failures in risk management and its focus on complex bets in the credit markets instead of lending.
Unlike their Senate counterparts, who accorded Mr. Dimon more deferential treatment last week, House lawmakers demanded answers. At one point, Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who helped write the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, told Mr. Dimon to "stop filibustering" and said that he was frankly "disappointed" with some of the banker's answers.
The hearing was the latest chapter of the trading debacle, which has drawn new cries from lawmakers for tougher oversight of the nation's banks and spurred wide-ranging inquiries by regulators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Peter Thiel Opens a New Venture Capital Firm | Peter Thiel is putting his Facebook proceeds back to work.
The billionaire investor, best known for his contrarian views and his early bet on the social network, has opened a new venture capital firm, Mithril Capital Management, with a $402 million fund. While it's unclear how much Mr. Thiel, who sold some $640 million worth of shares in Facebook's I.P.O., contributed to the pot, he is the fund's largest investor, according to a statement issued on Wednesday.
The San Francisco-based firm will fit somewhere between Mr. Thiel's other investment firms, Founders Fund, which tends to focus on earlier stage investments and Clarium Capital, a global macroeconomic hedge fund.
Mithril, led by Mr. Thiel and former Clarium managing director Ajay Royan, will seek "growth" opportunities - start-ups that have already raised some venture capital and are looking to ramp up significantly. According to Mr. Royan, the firm is looking globally but it is not interested in pre-I.P.O. companies, or companies on the verge of going public. He predicts Mithril's average investment will be north of $20 million.

TOP STORIES 
Dimon, Testifying Before House, Stays on Message | Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, tussled with lawmakers on Tuesday in his second showdown in Washington since JPMorgan, the nation's largest bank, disclosed a multibillion-dollar trading loss.
At a hearing of the House Financial Services Committee, members peppered Mr. Dimon, once considered Washington's favorite banker, with pointed questions about the bank's aggressive lobbying, its failures in risk management and its focus on complex bets in the credit markets instead of lending.
Unlike their Senate counterparts, who accorded Mr. Dimon more deferential treatment last week, House lawmakers demanded answers. At one point, Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who helped write the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul, told Mr. Dimon to "stop filibustering" and said that he was frankly "disappointed" with some of the banker's answers.
The hearing was the latest chapter of the trading debacle, which has drawn new cries from lawmakers for tougher oversight of the nation's banks and spurred wide-ranging inquiries by regulators and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

Peter Thiel Opens a New Venture Capital Firm | Peter Thiel is putting his Facebook proceeds back to work.
The billionaire investor, best known for his contrarian views and his early bet on the social network, has opened a new venture capital firm, Mithril Capital Management, with a $402 million fund. While it's unclear how much Mr. Thiel, who sold some $640 million worth of shares in Facebook's I.P.O., contributed to the pot, he is the fund's largest investor, according to a statement issued on Wednesday.
The San Francisco-based firm will fit somewhere between Mr. Thiel's other investment firms, Founders Fund, which tends to focus on earlier stage investments and Clarium Capital, a global macroeconomic hedge fund.
Mithril, led by Mr. Thiel and former Clarium managing director Ajay Royan, will seek "growth" opportunities - start-ups that have already raised some venture capital and are looking to ramp up significantly. According to Mr. Royan, the firm is looking globally but it is not interested in pre-I.P.O. companies, or companies on the verge of going public. He predicts Mithril's average investment will be north of $20 million.

HEADLINE: In Britain, a Plan to Give Shareholders More Say on Pay

BYLINE: JULIA WERDIGIER


HIGHLIGHT: Under new rules presented to Parliament, companies listed in Britain would have to gain majority support from shareholders for their executive compensation packages. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Britain will make shareholder votes on executive pay binding next year as part of a set of measures announced by the government on Wednesday to reign in excessive remuneration.
Vince Cable, the business secretary, presented the measures to Parliament on Wednesday, saying they would provide shareholders with new powers to hold companies accountable on their pay practices and increase transparency. The rules are expected to be approved by Parliament and then become law in October 2013.
"At a time when the global economy remains fragile, it is neither sustainable nor justifiable to see directors' pay rising at 10 percent a year, while the performance of listed companies lags behind and many employees are having their pay cut or frozen," Mr. Cable said.
Under the new rules, companies listed in Britain would have to gain majority support for their executive remuneration from their shareholders at least every three years or more often if they decide to increase pay. Companies will also no longer be able to pay departing directors more than shareholders have agreed.
But the measures, which also include the mandatory disclosure of a single figure for executives' total annual pay, were criticized by the opposition Labor Party as not going far enough and being a watered down version of initial proposals.
Chuka Umunna, a Labor Party member of Parliament, welcomed the binding vote and other measures but accused Mr. Cable of doing a U-turn on original proposals. "Having proposed an annual vote, he now seeks one every three years," Mr. Umunna said. "Is it not the case that this will simply incentivize boards to draft policy as broadly as possible?"
Shareholder opposition against remuneration practices has been building in Britain, the United States and elsewhere after some companies continued to hand out large paychecks even though their share prices had declined. The insurance company Aviva, the oil producer Cairn Energy and the advertising giant WPP had their pay practices rejected by more than half of investors recently. 
Mr. Cable said that companies would have to report a single figure of total pay for executives following complaints that remuneration reports were too confusing and deferred bonuses or long-term incentive plans made it harder to compare annual pay.
The measures, which are the result of months of consultations with investor groups and companies, won support from business groups. John Cridland, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the measures struck "a balance, by giving shareholders increased transparency on pay and providing ways to hold boards to account, without getting them bogged down in day-to-day micro-management."

HEADLINE: NYSE Euronext Stakes Claim in London

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: The firm has signed up the first company to switch its London trading activity to NYSE Euronext London, the company's new exchange in the British capital. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Initial public offerings in London have come to a halt, but that has not stopped NYSE Euronext from trying to get in on the action.
The company, which already operates exchanges in New York, Paris and a number of major cities, said on Wednesday that it had signed up the first company to switch its London trading activity from the London Stock Exchange to NYSE Euronext London, its new exchange.
Groupe Eurotunnel, which operates the Channel Tunnel between Britain and France, will start trading on NYSE Euronext London on July 19. The company already has its main listing with NYSE Euronext in Paris.
The announcement comes as NYSE Euronext looks to bolster its presence in London, Europe's financial capital. 
NYSE Euronext already runs its derivatives business, NYSE Liffe, from London, but is looking to tap into the broader financial markets by tempting companies to switch their London-based trading activity to the exchange, as well as to entice new issuers to use its London bourse.
Despite NYSE Euronext's global presence, its London operation is likely to face tough competition from the incumbent London Stock Exchange, and a current lack of new I.P.O.'s resulting from the market volatility caused by the financial crisis.
Diederik Zandstra, NYSE Euronext's head of international listings, said he had been in touch with market participants and potential new issuers to explain why they should choose the firm's London exchange over the London Stock Exchange.
"We're offering issuers a choice," Mr. Zandstra said in an interview. "Previously, many couldn't list with NYSE Euronext because we didn't have a London base."
With financial markets reeling from the global economic meltdown, exchanges have been keen to move into new markets. Last week, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing agreed to buy the London Metal Exchange for 1.38 billion, or $2.14 billion, as the Asian financial firm looked to diversify away from its core equities business.

HEADLINE: The Pawlenty Possibility

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: The Romney campaign contemplates playing blue collar identity politics with its veep pick. 

 BODY:
Hard on the heels of the (swiftly denied, but totally plausible) report that Team Romney isn't even vetting Marco Rubio as a potential running mate comes a Wall Street Journal report that Tim Pawlenty's star is rising in Romneyland:
Meantime, attention increasingly is turning to Tim Pawlenty, the former Minnesota governor and onetime Romney primary-season foe. Of elected officials who joined Mr. Romney in a recent six-state campaign tour, Mr. Pawlenty stood out to party leaders as they handicapped who might be chosen to join the GOP ticket.
Privately, some Romney campaign officials have offered that Mr. Pawlenty has impressed them with his work as a Romney representative on the campaign trail and with the press. "He's never done a bad interview" while acting as a campaign spokesman, said one Republican operative.
Moreover, Mr. Pawlenty's background as the son of a truck driver from South St. Paul, Minn., is a potential counterweight to Mr. Romney's wealth. The former governor also could help Mr. Romney in the battleground states of Minnesota and neighboring Iowa, both of which the campaign sees as potential pickups from President Barack Obama's 2008 column.
If the Romney campaign wants to pick Pawlenty on a "first, do no harm" basis, as the candidate least likely to embarrass on the stump or have unexpected skeletons rattling his closet, then that would be a defensible move, and one that would be entirely of a piece with Romney's overall strategy of caution. But if Romney picks Pawlenty in order to make an identity-politics play for blue collar votes in the suddenly up-for-grabs Upper Midwest, he'll be risking making the same mistake that the McCain campaign made with Sarah Palin, and that Pawlenty himself made when he competed unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination last year: Assuming that an appeal based on identity is a substitute for an appeal based on substance.
Both Palin and Pawlenty have profiles that fit the white, downscale constituency that Republicans probably need to consolidate in order to defeat Barack Obama. Both came to national politics equipped with home-staterecords that had significant populist appeal. But as national candidates, their messages were deeply conventional, all movement-conservative talking points with none of the creativity they'd shown at the state level. Palin could blame the deeply-uncreative McCain campaign for this, but Pawlenty had no one to blame but himself. Here the contrast between his stillborn presidential campaign and more successful "blue collar" forays by Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum is particularly striking: Pawlenty essentially tried to run as the supply-sider's supply-sider on policy, whereas both Huckabee and Santorum recognized (albeit, yes, without offering much detail or rigor) that a populist style needs at least some populist substance.
If Romney is hoping to win this election in the states where Santorum gave him a run for his money in the primaries, he should ponder that contrast and act accordingly. As a friend put it to me today, , and just having a truck driver's son on the ticket isn't going to overcome (justifiable) working class skepticism about the Republican economic message unless that truck driver's son is given an effective economic message to push.

HEADLINE: New Ads Trade Shots on the Economy

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama and several conservative groups are going head-to-head in a flurry of new attack ads, trading accusations over mishandled economic policies and inattention to the plight of struggling Americans. 

 BODY:
President Obama and several conservative groups are going head-to-head in a flurry of new attack ads, trading accusations over mishandled economic policies and inattention to the plight of struggling Americans.
Over the next week and a half, viewers in 10 battleground states will be hit with $33 million in advertising, part of an aggressive effort by Mr. Obama, Mitt Romney and three conservative advocacy groups to define their opponent before undecided voters make up their minds.
The Obama campaign released two television commercials on Wednesday that condemn Mitt Romney as a "corporate raider" who shipped jobs overseas, cut taxes for the wealthy and raised fees on the middle class. Both ads end with the campaign's latest attack slogan, an attempt to turn Mr. Romney's financial experience as a private equity executive into a liability: "Romney economics: it didn't work then, and it won't work now."
The new advertising from Mr. Romney and the conservative groups - a $20 million offensive - takes aim at the president on two issues: his economic leadership and his health care overhaul plan, which the Supreme Court is set to rule on.
One ad that is running in six states as part of a $5 million effort by the Concerned Women for America features a female doctor who worries that the new health care law will force her to stop seeing some of her patients. "I've looked at this law. I know the consequences: delayed care and worse yet, denied care."
No fewer than three new ads turn Mr. Obama's recent verbal misfire - "the private sector is doing fine" - back on him. There are minor variations in style, but the ads all contain the same message: the president is out of touch. All three also have the same title, "Doing Fine."
The Romney campaign, which has committed $3.4 million to television advertising through early next week, started its version of "Doing Fine" last week, a twist on a 2008 commercial from the Obama campaign that mocked Senator John McCain for uttering the ill-timed phrase "the fundamentals of our economy are strong" as the stock market was plummeting and the economy was collapsing.
Restore Our Future, the pro-Romney "super PAC," started running its version this week as part of a $7.2 million buy, as did Americans for Prosperity, the Koch brothers-affiliated group, with a $4.6 million buy.
The 10 states included in the latest spate of advertising are Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia.

HEADLINE: Speaking of the Economy, Let's Talk About Immigration

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Campaign aides wanted to discuss what it called President Obama's "record of failure on the economy." Reporters wanted to know about Mr. Romney's views on immigration. The conference call abruptly ended. 

 BODY:
What's on the mind of a campaign's message machine may not be the burning issue in journalists' minds. When Mitt Romney's campaign held a conference call with reporters on Wednesday morning to discuss what it called President Obama's "record of failure on the economy," the first three questions from reporters were about Mr. Romney's views on immigration. Campaign press aides abruptly ended the conversation.
Lanhee Chen, Mr. Romney's policy director, and Tom Stemberg, the founder of Staples, anchored the press call. Both gave brief opening statements on recent grim economic statistics, the latest being a report on Tuesday by the Labor Department that job openings in April fell by the most in nearly four years.
"All of this can be traced to the failed economic policies of the Obama administration,'' Mr. Stemberg, a longtime supporter of Mr. Romney's, said. Mr. Romney often cites his early investment in Staples while at Bain Capital and the office supply company's explosive growth as Exhibit A in his case that he knows how to create jobs.
Journalists on the call immediately changed the subject. The first, from The Wall Street Journal, asked if Mr. Romney would address immigration at a speech in Florida on Thursday to a national group of Hispanic elected officials. Since President Obama's order last weekthat young people brought illegally into the country would not be deported - a move designed to cement support with Hispanic voters - Mr. Romney's response has been eagerly sought. Over the weekend, Mr. Romney said he would prefer to seek a long-term solution, but he has not said if he would reverse Mr. Obama's order.
Mr. Chen replied that Mr. Romney "will have a few more things to say about immigration" in Florida, but he stressed that much of the message to Hispanic voters at the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials meeting on Thursday would be consistent with the campaign's economic message up to now - that Hispanic Americans are suffering more in the struggling economy than other groups.
Asked a follow-up question about immigration by The New York Times, Mr. Chen replied that he had already answered.
A press aide, Kristy Campbell, said "these questions should be specific" to the subject of the economy.
A third questioner asked Mr. Chen if the president's action, which among other things will allow hundreds of thousands of immigrants age 30 and under to work legally, if temporarily, "would help or hurt the United States economy.''
Ms. Campbell, representing a campaign that prides itself on message discipline, then ended the press conference. "Well have more information on the run-up to the governor's speech tomorrow,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Senate Move to Reverse Mercury Rule Fails

BYLINE: REBECCA BERG


HIGHLIGHT: The vote was 46 to 53; only five Democrats crossed the aisle to support it. 

 BODY:
A Senate resolution seeking to reverse federal regulations limiting emissions of mercury and other toxic substances from coal-burning power plants failed to win passage on Wednesday. The resolution, introduced by Senator James M. Inhofe, an Oklahoma Republican, won support from 46 senators; 53 voted against it.
The Environmental Protection Agency rules, issued late last year, have been criticized by some utilities, coal producers, Congressional Republicans and other foes as overly broad and potentially harmful to the economy. The Obama administration has defended the new regulations as critical to protecting public health. 
 Mr. Inhofe argued that the regulations amounted to a "war on coal" that would result in job losses and higher energy prices. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has also opposed the rule on economic grounds.
But President Obama cited the rule limiting emissions from power plants as a signal achievement in his State of the Union address in January, and the White House warned this week that he would veto the resolution if it landed on his desk.

 Opposition from the Senate's Democratic majority ensured that it wouldn't come to that: only five Democratic senators supported the resolution, including Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia. 
West Virginia's other senator, Jay Rockefeller, also a Democrat, voted against the measure, saying it "moves us backward, not forward."

HEADLINE: Campaigns and Crankiness

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Posturing is the cornerstone of modern politics.&#160;Maybe we are edging toward calamity. 

 BODY:
Have I ever told you that I get a bit curmudgeonly when I grow weary? No? Well, sit a spell. Take your shoes off.
We are in the middle of another tight presidential election where the contrast between the candidates is sharp, but the discourse is dull. That's the problem.
There isn't a dime's distance between Obama and Romney in the polls. This election is close. But we still have nearly five months before votes are cast so I'm getting irritated because we're being inundated with inanities. (I also abuse alliteration when I'm tired - so there.)
Pundits pick over every strategic or tactical machination - they break it down, comb through it and analyze it to no end. These maneuvers are always part of a war on something sacred: women, religion, the middle-class, job creators, logic, freedom.
Every political position heralds the end of times, or at least the end of America's time, as if we are still the envy of all others, the ones who rise above and go beyond, the do-right country with the can-do attitude.
The truth is that we are a broken government, operating on borrowed money and borrowed time. We don't have the vision or will or wherewithal to spend or save. So we float forward as the roar of the nearing falls grows louder. We battle over who should row the boat and in which direction, as the spray of crashing waters moistens our faces.
As a country, we are at a decision point.
Not only can we not do big things, we can't do small ones either. Politicians have every reason to prattle on about the evils of the other side rather than to compromise for the greater good. Saving the country comes second to saving one's own hind, so politicians surrender a pound of flesh for a ton of cash.
Governing is that thing governments used to do. Posturing is the cornerstone of modern politics. Maybe we are edging toward calamity.
As the Washington Post reported in December:
Congress is close to wrapping up one of its least productive sessions in recent memory, as the House and Senate have passed a scant number of bills compared with other non-election years, and President Obama has signed the fewest measures into law in at least two decades.
But hey, November is coming. We must be spoon-fed millions of dollars of billionaires' gripes and grievances. Invisible hands must massage our temples and tell us fictions until the sheer weight of repetition makes them sound like facts.
Obama is aggressive. Romney is evasive. Republicans are still trying to get a scandal to stick. Democrats are trying to get the pox on Romney's record to resonate. The last couple of days have brought this into sharp relief.
As Talking Points Memo reported Wednesday, Ken Bennett, who is Secretary of State in Arizona and co-chairman of Romney's campaign there, is now floating a new outrageous theory: Obama was born in Hawaii but lied and said he was born in Kenya for a college admissions advantage. (Maybe he saw the damage that Elizabeth Warren caused herself in Massachusetts and decided to see what he could do with such a charge nationally.) According to T.P.M., Bennett said of Obama:
Now, I know there's a lot of people that are very skeptical as to whether he was born in Hawaii. Personally I believe that he was. I actually believe he was fibbing about being born in Kenya when he was trying to get into college and doing things like writing a book and on and on and on.
In other sensationalist news on Wednesday, the Republican-controlled House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for failing to turn over documents as part of the committee's probe of the controversial "Fast and Furious" operation, after the president invoked executive privilege to shield the documents from the committee.
House Speaker John Boehner's office immediately jumped on the president's decision. His spokesman, Michael Steel, said:
Until now, everyone believed that the decisions regarding Fast and Furious were confined to the Department of Justice. The White House decision to invoke executive privilege implies that White House officials were either involved in the Fast and Furious operation or the cover-up that followed. The administration has always insisted that wasn't the case. Were they lying, or are they now bending the law to hide the truth?
There goes that word "lying" again, but this time followed by "bending the law to hide the truth"? Implication: White House cover-up. 
For the Obama campaign's part, it continues to roll out ads attacking Romney's record, but it is unclear if any of them are resonating. They certainly don't with me. I don't have to find Romney to be a bad man for him to be a bad choice. He is a shady opportunist who has outlined a broad set of policy prescriptions that I believe would prove disastrous if they were implemented. On top of that he seems to be planning to obfuscate about specifics until it is too late for people to protest.
Enough said.
As for his business background, operating within an economy is nothing like overseeing one. It's like saying you know how to cook a meal because you cleaned your plate.
But the battle must rage. Confetti must fall. Doubts must be raised. Clear choices must be rendered cloudy. Undisclosed contributions must be spent. Undeliverable promises must be made. Voters must be purged. Fear must be stoked and assuaged.
We must go through the motions of assessing leadership because the motions are all we have left.

        
Romney the Cautious
        
Believing in Obama
        
Economy or Personality?

HEADLINE: In Western Pennsylvania, an Energy Boom Not Visibly Stifled

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
SMITHFIELD, Pa. -- From his farm nestled far from the big cities, in the wooded hills above the Monongahela and Cheat Rivers, David Headley has not heard much about the battles in Washington over regulations that Republicans say are stifling a domestic energy revolution.
At the ground level of that revolution Mr. Headley, a 53-year-old former body shop owner and unemployed bus driver, does not see any regulations at all.
For three years, he and his wife, Linda, have wrestled with the land men, natural gas drillers and pipeline builders who are turning this very sleepy corner of Western Pennsylvania into an energy boom land. The farm Mr. Headley bought in 2006 for his semiretirement has become something of a nightmare. Gas wells leak. Drilling blowouts have spewed fine, chalky bentonite into trout-stocked Georges Creek, turning it a milky white. A spring where his wife's three horses once watered now bubbles and belches. Touched with a flame, it will ignite.
The Headleys blame the men who worked on the drilling platform in their front yard for the disappearance of their beagle, Sarah. Linda had to rescue their remaining dog, Banjo, from a sludge pond, leaving her hands cracked and burning for six months. 
And last month, a dispute over an $11,000 payment for a pipeline right of way ended with state troopers, guns drawn, pouring out of 10 patrol cars and accusing Mr. Headley of criminal trespassing on his own land. A judge forced the gas company to pay the money -- and slapped Mr. Headley with an injunction to keep 50 feet from the pipeline running through his property.
''They're doing whatever they want, whenever they want to,'' he said, shaking his head as he walked by the shale gas well head and separation tanks humming in sight and earshot of his front porch.
For more than a year now, Republicans in Washington -- and Mitt Romney on the stump -- have been pressing the case that the Obama administration is trying to squash an energy boom already well under way, fostered by the technological development of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking.
On Thursday, the House will vote on a broad bill to streamline the energy permitting process on federal lands and direct the administration to establish production objectives for oil, gas, coal and oil shale -- part of a broader effort to establish Republicans as champions of domestic energy. On Wednesday, the Senate voted down a Republican bill to stop new regulations on utility emissions.
''We have these Big Government policies out of D. C. that are turning off the lights,'' said Keith Rothfus, a Republican House candidate in a newly drawn Western Pennsylvania district he calls ''America's new energy capital.''
But to make that case, Republicans will have to convince voters in regions like Western Pennsylvania that the free-for-all they see all around them could somehow be even more, well, free. It is a tough sell.
''It's the Wild West,'' said C. J. Callahan, a 29-year-old banker in Point Marion, grabbing dinner with his wife and newborn baby at Apple Annie's, just down the road from the Headleys. ''There aren't regulations. It's just, get it out as quick as you can, because they're going to do the regulations down the road.''
The natural gas industry is toeing the same difficult line, boasting of its explosive growth while warning of the dangers to come. A study released this month by America's Natural Gas Alliance, a trade group, concluded that unconventional natural gas activities -- like oil shale fracking -- employed one million Americans in 2010, and that employment would grow to 1.5 million by 2015 and to more than 2.4 million by 2035.
Between 2010 and 2035, the gas boom will generate nearly $1.5 trillion in federal, state and local taxes and royalty revenues, the economic firm IHS predicted.
Early last year, Western Pennsylvania's Washington County chalked up the third-fastest growth among the country's 322 largest counties. Just to the north, Butler County ranked sixth. Between those two, Beaver County could soon be the site of a Royal Dutch Shell ethane cracker, a billion-dollar plant that breaks down the gas ethane into the more valuable industrial compound ethylene.
Even the federally owned Allegheny National Forest is open for gas business, industry officials say.
''It's unbelievable, the opportunity,'' said Frank Puskarich, 58, a Washington County former coal miner who in five years has seen his mobile Hog Father's Bar-B-Que expand to three trucks and three trailers traveling four states to cater to the natural gas trade. ''And it's not just me. It's leather makers, grocery stores, truck drivers, guys with dump trucks.''
Yet, the industry also says, a looming Environmental Protection Agency study on fracking and a cumbersome Army Corps of Engineering permitting process are creating uncertainty, turning some of the public against gas.
''We certainly haven't met the potential,'' said Kathryn Klaber, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, a Pittsburgh-based industry alliance pressing for development of the vast Marcellus shale ''play'' that stretches from West Virginia to upstate New York.
The fortunes to be made have salved the headaches and heartaches in this stretch of Gasland. The Headleys are the unlucky ones. The wells on their property are spinning off an estimated $20,000 a month in royalties -- not for them, but for the New Jersey man who sold them the property, but kept the gas rights.
Still, whole towns have been woken from the dead.
Stanley E. Cree, 81, said trucks rumble by his house in Waynesburg 24 hours a day.
''Oh hell, yes, it's helped a lot of people,'' he said. ''Heck, I've made a small fortune myself.''
The 50 acres he bought long ago for $3,500 an acre is now selling for $33,600. He has sold 10 or 12 of them, he figured, plus pipeline rights of way for an additional $300,000.
Mr. Headley said the drilling foreman on his property told him he had drilled all over the world but never in a place easier than Pennsylvania: ''Ask for what you want and you'll get it,'' he quoted the driller.
Matt Pitzarella, a spokesman for the Range Resources Corporation, the discoverer of the Marcellus play, bristled at the term ''Wild West.'' He pointed out the stone verge along the gravel road leading down from a bustling fracking operation in Washington County, the rubber tarmac, the resodded hillside and the emergency ''spill kits'' -- all required by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.
''Anyone suggesting a lack of regulations for this industry in Pennsylvania is a fool,'' he said.
But beyond the frack pads and drilling wells, it appears to be easier to find voters here worried more about too little regulation than too much.
Joe Bezjak, a retired junior high school principal in Nicholson Township, called the notion of overregulation ''ludicrous.'' In fact, he said, the whole region is bought and paid for by the gas men.

HEADLINE: In Iran, They Want Fun, Fun, Fun

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
ALONG THE CASPIAN SEA, Iran
One of the most pernicious misunderstandings in the West about Iranians is that they are dour religious fanatics.
About half of Iranians are under the age of 25, and Iran has done a solid job of raising their education levels. I was struck on my 1,700-mile road trip across Iran by how many of them share American values, seeking fun rather than fanaticism. They seem less interested in the mosques than in amusement parks (which are ubiquitous in Iran).
''Young people don't really go to the mosques,'' said a 23-year-old man in eastern Iran, cheerfully exaggerating. ''We want more ways to have fun.'' He said he drinks -- alcohol is illegal but everywhere -- and, until recently, used drugs. Iranian officials have suggested that perhaps 10 percent of the population uses illegal drugs, traditionally opium and heroin but increasingly methamphetamines as well. 
This man had joined the 2009 democracy protests, but then, he said, he was detained and beaten for several days, losing a tooth in the process. That soured him on political activism, and, like many others, he now just wants to go abroad.
In the northwest, that sense of hopelessness has led some young Iranians of ethnic Turkish origin to favor seceding and joining Azerbaijan. In soccer games in Tabriz, fans sometimes outrage the authorities by roaring secessionist slogans.
You wouldn't think a New Yorker could be made to blush in Tehran, but I was taken aback by the hookup scene of one-night stands: young men with flashy cars troll for women, chat them up and then drive off with them. There is also prostitution, and Tehran's former police chief was arrested in 2008 in a brothel together with six prostitutes.
Remember that Iran is the homeland not only of stern ayatollahs but also of the romantic hedonism of ''The Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam.'' In Richard Le Gallienne's verse translation: ''Did God set grapes a-growing, do you think,/And at the same time make it sin to drink?''
In the 1970s, disgruntled young Iranians rebelled against a corrupt secular regime by embracing an ascetic form of Islam. Now they're rebelling against a corrupt religious regime by embracing personal freedom -- in some cases, even sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.
They often also look warmly on the United States, which is quite dizzying. In Pakistan, Afghanistan and Egypt, we Americans hand out billions of dollars in aid and are often hated. I come to Iran, and people hand me gifts!
This youth culture of Iran is nurtured by the Internet -- two-thirds of Iranian households have computers -- and by satellite television, which is banned but widespread. A BBG/Gallup phone survey conducted in March found that one-third of Iranians acknowledged watching satellite television in the previous week, and the real number may be much higher.
''The effect of satellite TV is very big,'' said one young woman who said that she was initially aghast when she saw fellow Muslim women in Turkey wearing bikinis but gradually decided that there was more than one way to live.
Police stage raids to confiscate satellite dishes and can fine homeowners as much as $400 for having them, but they're not very efficient.
''You recognize that it's the police taking the dishes away, and you just don't answer the door,'' said a shop owner in Gorgan. ''So they take the dish and just go away,'' without imposing the fine.
Pirated music, videos and video games are widespread. One popular -- but banned -- game now is Battlefield 3, in which American military forces storm Tehran. In one home I visited, the kids were playing Grand Theft Auto.
These young people are Iran's future, and they can be our allies. But while we have a strategy in nuclear negotiations, I'm not sure we in the West have a strategy for Iran itself.
Western policy makers see Iran as fanatical, the same way they saw China in the 1960s. There was talk back then of a military option against China, and if we had taken that route, Beijing might still be ruled by Maoists -- a larger version of North Korea.
My road trip across Iran leaves me convinced that change will come here, too, if we just have the patience not to disrupt the subterranean forces at work: rising education, an expanding middle class, growing economic frustration, erosion of the government monopoly on information. My hunch is that if there is no war between Iran and the West -- which would probably strengthen the regime -- hard-liners will go the way of Mao, and Iran will end up looking something like Turkey.
I think of a young man I met who said wistfully: ''It's normal for a boy and a girl to want to hang out together. What's wrong with that?'' The romantics are on our side and far outnumber the fanatics. We should bet on them, not bombs, as agents of change.

HEADLINE: China, Citing Errors, Vows to Overhaul Rare Earth Industry

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's cabinet issued on Wednesday its first white paper on rare earth industry policies, acknowledging that poorly regulated mining of rare earth metals had caused widespread environmental damage and promising an extensive cleanup and a crackdown on illegal mines. 
The document warned that inefficient mining and refining practices had squandered scarce mineral reserves and produced extensive emissions of radioactive residues, heavy metals and other contaminants.
''Excessive rare earth mining has resulted in landslides, clogged rivers, environmental pollution emergencies and even major accidents and disasters, causing great damage to people's safety and health and the ecological environment,'' the white paper said.
China produces more than 90 percent of the world's rare earth metals, which are essential to high-technology applications from smartphones to smart bombs and are also used in oil refining, glass polishing, batteries, electric car motors and many other industrial applications.
The document comes after the United States, the European Union and Japan jointly filed a case in March at the World Trade Organization that challenged China's restrictions on rare earth exports, which were imposed in 2006 and have been repeatedly tightened since then. The W.T.O. case argues that the export quotas and tariffs violate free trade rules by putting pressure on companies to move their factories to China if they want to tap China's vast supply of rare earths.
Chinese officials have previously signaled that their defense in that case will be to use a provision of W.T.O. rules that allows export restrictions for environmental protection and the conservation of scarce natural resources. But they were quick to deny Wednesday that this had been their motive for releasing the white paper.
''The protection of the environment is never a pretext for gaining advantage or increasing economic returns,'' Su Bo, a deputy minister of industry, said at a news conference in Beijing.
The white paper says China has only 23 percent of the world's rare earth reserves and has already depleted the most accessible reserves. But the United States Geological Survey a year ago raised its estimate of Chinese rare earth reserves, to half the world's supply, compared with a third of the world's reserves.
Various local and provincial governments across China have announced numerous discoveries of large rare earth deposits in recent years, yet Chinese officials have scarcely changed official estimates for nationwide reserves, rare earth industry experts point out.
The Chinese government has already been quietly closing rare earth refineries for months at a time in the last year and forcing them to install costly environmental controls. Together with a plunge in world prices for rare earths in the last year as a speculative surge has subsided, the environmental rules have hurt profit margins for exporters.
Dudley Kingsnorth, an adjunct professor specializing in rare earths at Curtin University in Perth, Australia, said that the white paper, ''is really only a more formal statement of their current actions to place more effective control on the industry to reduce the impact on the environment while ensuring they receive a better return on their rich endowment of rare earths.''

HEADLINE: Home Prices in the West Are Rebounding as Inventory Shrinks

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
PHOENIX -- Prices for existing homes here and in surrounding areas climbed by 25 percent during the 12-month period that ended in April, pointing to a decisive shift in the market realities of a place where foreclosed signs, abandoned properties and deserted neighborhoods became one of the most enduring symbols of the nation's crippling real estate bust.
But hold off on the fireworks for a moment. 
The rise in prices may be driven less by a resurgence in the local economy -- real as it is -- than by an inopportune dearth of houses for sale, as well as a steep decline in the number of bank-owned bargains hitting the market.
Builders, wary of committing too much money to new housing in the aftermath of the recession and painfully slow recovery, did not have enough units available to match an unexpected increase in demand from buyers. Property owners, meanwhile, have remained on the sidelines, waiting for higher prices before putting their houses up for sale.
''We're suffering from a case of buyers' enthusiasm just as we're running out of homes to sell,'' said Mike Orr, director of the Center for Real Estate Theory and Practice at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University and the author of a monthly report on the area's housing stock.
The increase in Phoenix-area home prices far outpaced the rise in home values nationwide, where the median price of existing single-family homes went up by 10.1 percent, according to the National Association of Realtors' most recent statistics. It was also higher than the surge in home prices in the West as a whole, which, at 16 percent, was the most robust gain among all regions in the United States.
Prices here have not fallen since September -- a good sign, but not yet a sign of a booming real estate market, analysts said.
In Las Vegas, another city crushed by the burst of the housing bubble, the market hit its bottom in March. But while there has been an increase in sales and construction activity since, home values have been slower to rise.
And in Atlanta, another city hit hard by the economic downturn, the situation is worse today than it was a year ago because of a stubbornly high number of foreclosures.
When all is taken into account, the picture evokes caution: the overall value of homes in 20 metropolitan regions tracked by Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller index remained unchanged, and prices are still sitting at their lowest point.
''Because of new buyers having difficulty getting mortgages and because of the still-large number of foreclosures hitting the market in some parts of the country, it's hard to say that we've turned a corner,'' David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at Standard & Poor's, said in an interview.
Even in Phoenix and its suburbs, the rebound in house prices has been uneven.
Home values are still declining in the areas that were least affected by foreclosures during the recession, like upscale Cave Creek and Fountain Hills on the metropolitan area's northeast rim, according to Professor Orr's report. They have risen most acutely in places hardest hit by foreclosures, for instance west side suburbs like Glendale and Tolleson.
Christopher J. Mayer, a professor of real estate at Columbia Business School, said the price increase happened because foreclosed homes, which were usually among the cheapest, were no longer widely available. In the Phoenix area alone, the number of distressed homes on the market fell by 81 percent in the year ended in April, and the number of foreclosures fell by 62 percent, the report showed.
New home construction has picked up, though, as builders try to replenish the market, targeting not the small investors who are still looking to buy cheap homes they can fix and flip or turn into rentals, but first-time homebuyers and expanding families who are trying to enter the game before prices get too high for them.
Some of those builders, however, have temporarily closed sales offices because they cannot build enough homes to fulfill the demand. Others have been rushing to buy land.
Jordan Rose, a lawyer in neighboring Scottsdale who represents builders buying large parcels for development, said her law firm had handled 70 percent more transactions so far this year than during any other period over the previous four years.
One of the state's most prolific builders, Maracay Homes, bought 13 pieces of land for development over the past 30 months in Phoenix and Tucson, where homes have been rising at a fast clip. As of June 1, the company had sold as many homes -- 242 -- as it did in all of last year, its president, Andy Warren, said.
Over all, builders have on average a two-and-a-half-month supply of new homes in their subdivisions.
''There's certainly a trajectory of recovery,'' Mr. Warren said, ''but it might be a couple of years until we get there.''
The low inventory has fueled bidding wars again. A foreclosed house in the suburb of Chandler, bought for $225,000 in 2006 and listed by the bank for $57,420 last month, got 84 offers -- and the offers stopped coming only because the bank stopped accepting them. (A note to brokers on the listing reads, ''NO MORE OFFERS.'') The sale was pending as of Monday.
On a recent Thursday, Jesse Pekarek, a broker with HomeSmart who has been selling homes in the area for almost nine years, was inspecting the cosmetic repairs he had asked a homeowner to make -- a fresh coat of paint, new tiles -- before putting the house up for sale.
The home -- single-family with three bedrooms and two baths in the city of Mesa, just east of here -- went on the market the following Saturday for $135,000.
By Sunday, it was already under contract, after the homeowner received multiple offers above the asking price, Mr. Pekarek said.
''Homes don't necessarily have to have all the bells and whistles,'' he said. ''If they're priced accordingly, and if they're in a nice neighborhood, they'll sell in the first few days, if not within hours.''

HEADLINE: An Equity Share in a Graduate's Income?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''The College Graduate as Collateral,'' by Luigi Zingales (Op-Ed, June 14), about financing education through equity rather than debt:
As a recent master's graduate of Yale, I know firsthand the heavy burden of school debt. But I worry about giving investors a stake in maximizing how much money I earn over the coming years. Would my financiers, viewing themselves as my ''shareholders,'' be allowed to take me to court for not making the most prudent decisions in my own life?
Managers of public corporations have brought the economy and the planet to the point of crisis in the name of maximizing returns to their shareholders. 
I would hate to find out how such a situation would play out when investors try to maximize their return on investment in me.
KEVIN KROMASH New Haven, June 14, 2012
To the Editor:
I generally feel that the term ''wage slavery'' is misleading hyperbole, but it's the only term that comes to mind when reading Luigi Zingales's proposal.
He is suggesting an efficient way for the wealthiest Americans to amass yet more wealth at the expense of bright, indebted, hard-working students. As a recent college graduate, I'm disgusted.
YITZHAK BRONSTEIN New York, June 14, 2012
To the Editor:
Luigi Zingales proposes that we ''link tuition financing to the incomes of college graduates,'' yet it's questionable how satisfied investors might be with his own decision to stay in academia rather than pursue a more lucrative career in the private sector. The prospects are even worse for someone like me who studies literature.
While he's right that the tuition system needs a severe overhaul, treating students like investments ignores the fact that some achievements are less quantifiable than others.
It also underscores how the free market might not hold all the answers to our country's woes.
JOSH BERNSTEIN Santa Monica, Calif., June 14, 2012
To the Editor:
I support Luigi Zingales's proposal to finance college with equity instead of debt. But there is one problem with the proposal.
Issuers of equity -- the students, in this case -- must comply with onerous rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission before they may sell an interest in their future to investors. The costs of compliance with these rules make this proposal a nonstarter for college students.
A recent example involved a minor-league baseball player trying to do what Mr. Zingales suggests; he quickly learned the error of his ways.
The law can be changed, and I think it should be, but this is a major obstacle to a great idea.
M. TODD HENDERSON Chicago, June 14, 2012
The writer is a professor at the University of Chicago Law School.
To the Editor:
If you accept that the underlying societal reason to finance students' college education is to make money for the financier, ''college graduate as collateral'' makes sense.
But if you think that our democratic Republic is fundamentally strengthened by having more educated and therefore more economically productive citizens, the G.I. Bill is the perfect model for financing college, a proven success after World War II in creating the most productive and wealthy country in history.
I propose military or civilian service in exchange for financing. Take the profit motive out of the education equation.

HEADLINE: Europe Needs a Federal Reserve

BYLINE: By AARON TORNELL and FRANK WESTERMANN. 
Aaron Tornell is a professor of economics at the University of California, Los Angeles. Frank Westermann is a professor of international economic policy at Osnabruck University, Germany.

 BODY:
AS the world economy teeters again, pressure is mounting on central banks to reopen their spigots, make it even cheaper for companies and households to borrow money, and prop up commercial banks to prevent another financial crisis. On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve, which had already promised to keep short-term interest rates near zero until the end of 2014, extended its latest, modest strategy to keep long-term rates down, too.
The Fed's counterpart, the European Central Bank, was created in 1998 to maintain price stability in the new euro zone. With so many depositors taking their money from troubled banks in Greece and Spain, observers are urging the central bank, based in Frankfurt, to fire another round of the ''big bazooka'' -- the roughly 1 trillion euros in cheap loans that it granted to banks in December and February. 
But even if it is willing to do this, the central bank is not equipped to do so without putting Europe's financial system at risk. Its design is flawed. To save the euro, the 17 countries that use the shared currency will not only need a more unified fiscal policy. They will also need a single institution to tide over troubled financial institutions, and a single banking authority to supervise banks and, if necessary, close or merge them.
Bizarrely, although the deutsche mark, franc and lira are gone, members of the euro zone still have their own national central banks, which can step in and lend euros. Since 2007, the credit extended by the central banks of Italy, Spain, Greece, Portugal and Ireland has increased tenfold, in part because the criteria for the collateral put up in exchange for central-bank loans were relaxed significantly in 2008 (and later, in Greece, Ireland and Portugal, almost completely discarded).
What ails the euro zone is not a Teutonic allergy to inflation, or a timidity about extending loans, but what economists call the tragedy of the commons. Here's an example: A group of people go for a drink and agree to split the tab. They tend to drink a bit more than when each goes alone. Each person gets to enjoy 100 percent of the marginal benefit of an additional drink, yet she is responsible only for a portion of that drink's cost. So she has an incentive to outdrink her friends and exploit the common pool of money that will be used to pay the tab.
The central bank system in Europe is akin to letting the government of California issue bonds, pledge them as collateral at the San Francisco branch of the Fed, and then get fresh dollars to pay for its budget deficit. If this were reality, imagine the strong temptation for California to tap Fed resources to indulge imbalanced spending and borrowing.
If the system isn't fixed, it will lead to another financial crisis. In the past, many countries that pursued expansionary credit policies to avoid economic turmoil precipitated only a deeper crisis. In 1994, for example, Mexico's central bank significantly increased loans to private banks, in an attempt to forestall a recession before a presidential election. The result: capital flight, a speculative attack on the peso and a financial crisis.
Europe is heading toward a similar mess. Since 2008, hardly any banks have been shut down in the euro zone, while American regulators have closed hundreds of institutions. Bank ''stress tests'' in countries like Spain continue to underestimate the true extent of bad loans. Greek banks were deemed solvent -- and therefore eligible for loans from Greece's central bank -- even as nervous depositors withdrew hundreds of millions of euros.
Only the European Central Bank, not national regulators, should have the power to decide if a bank is financially sound, and eligible for central-bank loans.
If the European Central Bank were to gain this power, it could shut down insolvent (zombie) banks, limit excessively high levels of central-bank credit, and make it clear to the euro zone's members that help from Frankfurt cannot go on forever.
Under Jean-Claude Trichet and now Mario Draghi, the European Central Bank has forestalled a panic and avoided setting off inflation so far -- a priority for Germany, Europe's largest economy. But it has been powerless as bank insolvencies mount, and it has failed to pressure governments to lower their budget deficits and implement economic reforms.
The national central banks -- including Germany's Bundesbank and the Bank of France -- should become subsidiaries of the European Central Bank like the 12 Federal Reserve Banks (in New York and San Francisco, etc.). Voting rights at the European Central Bank should be reorganized so that they are proportional to the share of the loss that each country would bear in case of default. Those who bear the largest share of the cost should have greater say as to when the drinking should stop.
To bolster ailing banks in southern Europe, some have called for the European Central Bank to insure deposits. Fine, but in exchange, all banks, not only the biggest ones, should be under the supervision of regulators in Frankfurt. They should have the sole authority to shut down, or merge, failing banks. When they offers credit, they should accept only marketable securities as collateral.
Without these reforms, zombie banks represent another financial crisis waiting to happen.

HEADLINE: Car Survey Shows Fewer Complaints But More With Personal Electronics

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Carmakers are doing a better job than ever eliminating nagging problems like wind noise, paint chips and balky engines.
Now the auto industry has to figure out how to make similar improvements in technologies aimed at users, like hands-free audio and navigation systems.
The latest automotive quality survey released on Wednesday by the research firm J. D. Power & Associates showed that consumers were reporting fewer overall problems with new vehicles. The luxury brands Lexus, Jaguar and Porsche topped the rankings, while General Motors' Cadillac and GMC divisions were the best performers among the Detroit brands. 
Yet the high quality scores posted by most automakers were tempered by a growing number of complaints about in-car technologies intended to allow users to issue voice commands, update their Facebook status, look up directions or check the weather forecast.
As consumers grow accustomed to ever-more sophisticated cellphones and computers, they are demanding the same level of performance from similar equipment in their cars and trucks, analysts say.
''Almost no manufacturer has solved that riddle yet,'' said David Sargent, head of auto research for J. D. Power. ''It's a collective learning experience that the industry is going through.''
Mr. Sargent presented the results of his firm's 2012 survey of initial auto quality on Wednesday at a meeting here of the Automotive Press Association. The study evaluates problems that consumers experience during the first 90 days of ownership.
Most of the findings were good news for car buyers and manufacturers.
This year's report shows that, on average, consumers report 102 problems per 100 vehicles. That was a 5 percent improvement over last year and the strongest year-over-year gain since 2009, when many car companies were struggling with financial problems that prompted cutbacks in product development.
As in past years, Japanese automakers generally fared better than American car companies. The lowest-rated major brand was the German company Volkswagen.
The margin of difference was small in most cases, yet all auto companies are finding that consumers are increasingly touchy about the performance of their in-car technology. Problems with electronic equipment increased 8 percent from last year and now represent the single biggest area of dissatisfaction with new models. While complaints in other categories have decreased 24 percent since 2006, problems with electronics have grown 45 percent in the same time period.
''Maybe that shouldn't be too much of a surprise,'' said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with the auto-research site Edmunds.com. ''There's a natural learning curve for these drivers to get adjusted to these new features.''
The hardest hit company was Ford, which has been aggressively installing dashboard touch-screen equipment in its mainstream models. Last year, the Ford brand dropped from fifth in the overall J. D. Power rankings to 23rd, as customers reported numerous problems in their MyFord Touch systems.
This year, Ford ranked 27th among all brands surveyed, in part because of continuing problems with the Touch systems.
In March, the company sent software upgrades to 377,000 owners of Ford and Lincoln products to make the technology simpler to use, but the upgrades were distributed after the J. D. Power survey was completed in February.
Ford said on Wednesday that future quality surveys should reflect the improvements from the software upgrades. ''We remain absolutely committed to continuously improving our vehicles,'' said Said Deep, a company spokesman.
Mr. Sargent declined to specify which manufacturers other than Ford had quality scores that were dragged down by electronic troubles. But he said Ford's broad introduction of touch-screen systems was bound to generate the biggest objection from consumers.
''In essence, Ford kind of took one for the team,'' Mr. Sargent said. ''They went big and they went early. But there are other manufacturers out there having issues that are just not as well known.''
Most of the complaints about technology came from younger consumers, Mr. Sargent said. That is because car buyers who are 35 and younger have the greatest expectations for new electronic systems and use them the most.
In the overall rankings, Toyota's Lexus luxury division was the top performer, with 73 reported problems per 100 vehicles. It was followed closely by three other luxury brands: Porsche, Jaguar and General Motors' Cadillac division. The high rating for Jaguar, owned by the Indian company Tata Motors, was particularly surprising, given the brand's history of problems.
The highest-rated mainstream brands were Honda, with 83 problems per 100 vehicles, and Toyota, with 88.
Honda's American sales have been hurt in the last year by inventory problems related to the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan and flooding in Thailand. But the company earned high scores from J. D. Power despite bringing out new versions of two of its biggest sellers, the CR-V sport utility and the Civic compact car, this year. New models tend to have more defects in their first year or two as manufacturers work out the kinks.
Two of the strongest domestic brands were GMC, the General Motors division that specializes in sport utility vehicles, and Chrysler's Ram unit, which sells only pickup trucks.
Among the poorest performers were the Dodge division of Chrysler, the Japanese automaker Mitsubishi, the German car brand Volkswagen and BMW's Mini division. Dead last at 151 problems per 100 vehicles were the microcar Smart and the Italian brand Fiat, which is just re-entering the American market after being absent for decades.
Mr. Sargent said brands like Dodge, Chrysler and G.M.'s Buick division lagged the industry average because of the presence of older models that are gradually being replaced after the government-financed bankruptcies of Chrysler and General Motors in 2009.
''Chrysler is still saddled with some of the problems they had with the older products,'' he said.
In 21 specific vehicle categories, Toyota and its Lexus brand scored highest in five and Nissan and its Infiniti brand topped four. G.M. led in four categories, including midsize cars, where the Chevrolet Malibu was No. 1. Ford had three of the best performers, headed by the Taurus as the best large passenger car.
The best overall single vehicle in the survey was the Porsche 911, which led the premium sporty segment. Mr. Sargent said it was ''probably the best vehicle we've ever seen in the study.''

HEADLINE: Living in Asia Appeals to More Company Leaders

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Amid ear-splitting clashes of cymbals and drums, a team of lion dancers strutted its stuff on the 34th floor of Citibank Tower last month in a traditional ceremony aimed at bringing good fortune to the office that was being inaugurated there that day.
The office is special: Located in one of the most prestigious towers of the central business area in Hong Kong, it now houses the global headquarters of Infiniti, the premium brand of the Japanese auto maker Nissan.
Nissan's headquarters are in Yokohama. And Infiniti cars are manufactured in Japan and the United States; two more sites are planned for as yet undisclosed locations in Europe and mainland China. But Nissan's management made a deliberate decision to base Infiniti's brain -- operations like brand strategy, product planning and sales, as well as the chief executive -- in a city that is not a must-be-there location for the automotive sector and where office rents are among the highest in the world. 
''The beauty of Hong Kong is that it is a gateway into China,'' and China is the brand's most important growth market, said Andy Palmer, who oversees the luxury business unit at Nissan, explaining the decision to base Infiniti in Hong Kong.
''This is not a cost-reduction or outsourcing exercise,'' he added.
In fact, Nissan's decision highlights a broader trend that is gaining momentum across Asia.
For years, U.S., European and Japanese companies have been building up blue-collar and back-office operations and representative offices in places like mainland China, Hong Kong and Singapore. Now top-level executives are joining them, increasing the amount of quality time they spend in those areas.
Take General Electric, the U.S. corporate powerhouse whose products include medical equipment, turbines and locomotives.
Last year, John Rice, vice chairman of G.E. and president and chief executive of global growth and operations for the company, relocated with his wife to Hong Kong.
The move was ''part substance and part symbolism,'' Mr. Rice said in an interview at his Hong Kong office. ''Being outside the United States makes you smarter about global issues. It lets you see the world through a different lens.''
Mr. Rice had traveled to Asia many times and visited China for the first time in 1989.
''I've come to China close to 100 times,'' he said, ''but I've learned more about China in the last 18 months than I did in the preceding 20 years.''
Michael Andrew, who took over as global chairman of KPMG International last October, echoed that sentiment.
''By being here, you demonstrate that you are not just an Anglo-Saxon firm -- it is a visible demonstration of your commitment to the region,'' said Mr. Andrew, who chose to base himself in Hong Kong.
Given the amount of traveling he does, Mr. Andrew spends only about 25 percent to 30 percent of his time in the city.
Still, even that means ''you become part of the fabric here,'' he said. ''You have regular access to key business leaders, and you are able to talk to them as one of them, rather than as someone who is just passing through.''
Another example: Schneider Electric, a French engineering company that derives more than a quarter of its sales from Asia, recently announced that two senior executives would move to Hong Kong. That increases to four the number of managers based in Hong Kong who report directly to the chief executive, Jean-Pascal Tricoire.
Mr. Tricoire remains based in Paris, though he spends so much time travelling in Asia that his family has moved to Hong Kong to spend more time with him.
Surveys conducted by the Economist Corporate Network show just how rapidly the trend toward more Asia-based management has accelerated in recent years.
In 2008, just 19 percent of non-Asian multinational companies surveyed had one or more board members living and working in Asia.
By last year, that figure had reached nearly 30 percent. What is more, 45.3 percent of the respondents in the 2011 survey expected to have board members in the region by 2016.
Not so long ago, said Ross O'Brien, director of the Economist Corporate Network's Hong Kong office, the trend was about moving manufacturing to where the growth was.
Now, ''it's about globalizing your brand and your thinking,'' Mr. O'Brien said.
''It's hard to make a decision to invest when you are based in a region where belt-tightening is the order of the day,'' he added, so being in Asia helps focus a company's thinking on the region's potential.
Hong Kong is not the only beneficiary of the trend.
Singapore, too, has attracted an expanding flock of top-level managers and divisional headquarters as companies seek to capitalize on the city-state's highly educated work force. And while Hong Kong is seen as the gateway to mainland China, Singapore is an ideal stepping stone for Southeast Asia and India.
Abbas Hussain, who oversees emerging-markets operations at the British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline, is based in the city, as is Deb Henretta, a member of the senior management team at Procter & Gamble.
And this month, Goldman Sachs announced it had rehired Mark Schwartz to serve as chairman of its Asia-Pacific region and as a vice chairman of the overall bank. Mr. Schwartz will be based in Beijing.
At the other end of the spectrum, many top executives, rather than making Asia their home, are simply travelling to the region more frequently.
And in March, Goldman Sachs, in a nod to India's growing importance, held a board meeting in New Delhi for the first time.
Starwood, the U.S. hotel company, went one step further: for a month last year, the senior management team based itself in Shanghai, a 12-hour time difference from Starwood's headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut.
The 15-member team was already relatively international. The majority of the group is not American, Frits van Paasschen, the Starwood chief executive, said by phone from Stamford. Moreover, two members are based in the Asia-Pacific region, one in Europe and one in Latin America.
Still, the temporary move allowed the team to immerse itself in the local culture and meet staff members and business partners in the region face to face. That sharpened management's understanding of how the Chinese market differs from that in the United States.
''We realized, for example, that in China many people book hotel rooms at the last minute, and on mobile devices,'' Mr. van Paasschen said.
The monthlong relocation, Mr. van Paasschen said, was ''both more strenuous and more useful than I had imagined.''
But clearly, the usefulness outweighed the strain, because Starwood is planning to repeat the exercise next year -- this time in Dubai, another important market for the company.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Big Push To Get Going

BYLINE: By MARY BILLARD

 BODY:
SHANNON WHITEHEAD and Kristin Glenn became fast friends working in bars in Manly Beach, Australia, a post-college ramble, before eventually returning home to the United States to buckle down in the reality of the bad economy. ''What are we going to do?'' recalled Ms. Glenn, 26, with a playful bored-child's plaintive emphasis on do.
During the summer of 2010, Ms. Whitehead, in Austin, Tex., and Ms. Glenn, in Denver, began seriously working on a prototype of their pipe dream, a functional, all-in-one adaptable garment for traveling. ''Kristen started playing with a piece of fabric, staples and very minimal sewing skills, and we brought it to a seamstress in Denver and started editing it and seeing what could come out of it,'' Ms. Glenn recalled.
Their creation? The Versalette by 3/5r 4/5evolution apparel, a convertible piece of cloth ingeniously engineered with the aid of buttons and drawstrings to be transformed with sleight-of-hand wizardry into a dress, shirt, scarf, purse -- in fact, a total of over 20 different functionalities. 
For financing, the partners turned to Kickstarter, the online fund-raising site for creative projects. Their video told the story of their desire to see change in the way clothes are made and consumed, to reduce the use of pesticides on cotton, harsh dyes and exploitive labor and still look good. A posted look book, the video and a downloadable PDF demonstrate the cunning variations, serving as a dresser's manual.
The money poured in, blasting past their $20,000 goal to eventually reach $64,246 in the women's self-designated 35-day offering. The 796 backers contributed anywhere from $5 for which they received a thank you video, to $500, scoring four Versalettes, a poster and a T-shirt. The sweet spot was $75, the threshold price at which the backers secured a Versalette. ''It was ridiculous,'' said Ms. Whitehead, 26. ''I was refreshing 60 times a day probably.''
Since Kickstarter's founding in April 2009, more than two million people have pledged over $250 million to projects in fields like art, film, technology, comics, games, fashion, food and publishing. Kickstarter takes 5 percent of the final amount of projects reaching their goal, and Amazon Payments processes the money and takes 3 percent to 5 percent. The projects must be fully financed to receive the pledged money. The average request is around $5,000. A staff member will view the submissions, offering mild feedback, like there should be a face in the video or the rewards don't reflect the project. ''We suggest they think in a different way,'' said Yancey Strickler, one of the three founders of Kickstarter, which is based on the Lower East Side.
Mr. Strickler explained that there are two basic types of Kickstarter fashion projects, which have brought in $3.5 million since the site began. Versalette is an example of a transactional start, attracting a broader base of backers who are essentially buying the product. ''There is the storefront creation where someone has made 10 prototypes and is using Kickstarter to say, 'Hey, if we get $5,000 worth sold, we'll make some more,' '' he said in a recent phone interview.
Storefront projects tend to the inventive, like the JoeyBra, featuring a handy side pocket for iPhones or credit cards ($10,346 pledged), or niche, like the Shredly, a mountain bike apparel concern based in Aspen, Colo., acknowledging that women are ''rad,'' and are not into black, boring or baggy ($25,897).
The other model, which Mr. Strickler called the patronage model, is the couture or bespoke project. Couture rewards are personally designed T-shirts (T-shirts are big on Kickstarter) and face time with the designers or sketches. ''The bespoke couture project is less a consumer creation, and contributions are more likely to come from people who love and care for that person,'' Mr. Strickler said.
High-profile examples include the ''Project Runway'' alumni Olivier Green and Anthony Ryan Auld, who turned to Kickstarter to subsidize the creation of their Fall/Winter 2012/2013 creations.
Amber Jimenez, 30, is a fledgling designer who works out of a small apartment in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Arriving in New York from San Francisco in 2008, Ms. Jimenez was hired by the milliner Albertus Swanepoel. She also started Ambit, a small collection of minimal yet feminine romantic clothes, priced from $100 to $600. After one small collection, which was picked up at the avant-garde downtown store End of Century, she was encouraged though she also received a reality check. She sought to raise $6,800 on Kickstarter to make a Fall 2011 collection and show in a gallery.
''I had to be one of those fund-raiser people and call friends and say this is really important and blah, blah, blah,'' said Ms. Jimenez, who did make her goal with $70 to spare. The money financed production at a fashion district factory. DailyCandy ran a flattering article on Ambit, mentioning the Kickstarter campaign. Soon after, the line was picked up by a store in Japan. Still fledgling, Ambit produced 100 pieces this spring, and is now self financing. ''It shows you can move to New York and start from nothing,'' Ms. Jimenez said.
When the neophyte designer Mandy Kordal, 25, moved to New York from Cincinnati in 2009, it was a soft landing. First, she was hired by Betsey Johnson and then moved on to Doo.Ri, where she designed the collection sweaters for the runway.
Ms. Kordal designs her patterns, featuring intricate detailing, and until recently hand-knit all the lightweight Japanese-inspired creations in her apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. Ms. Kordal bartered knitwear to a filmmaker friend who shot her fund-raising Kickstarter video. ''It makes you really think how you want to present yourself and where you are going,'' she said.
After reaching her $10,000 goal, Ms. Kordal started using a small knitwear factory in Queens to produce her line. ''I'm really adamant about producing in the United States,'' said Ms. Kordal, whose most recent temporary job was designing for Crewcuts, the J. Crew children's line. ''Knitwear is such a specific skill set: using the machinery; how to program the pattern. It's important to keep that knowledge in the U.S.''
Continuum: Computational Couture's stated goal was democratizing bespoke for the masses through interactive technologies. In the video, the designer Mary Huang explained an app that allows users to draw a dress, which is turned into a 3-D model and exported to a cutting pattern sized to their measurements. A posted prototype of a resulting dress, more art than garment, was a pattern of triangular pieces, perfect for the stylish futuristic denizens of the Capitol in ''The Hunger Games.''
The proposal fell short of raising the $15,000 requested, drawing $8,749. Her partner, Jenna Fizel, an M.I.T.-trained architect who designs interactive museum exhibits at a firm in Cambridge, Mass., credits the exercise with bringing clarity to their next work, a cool-looking 3D printed bikini. The bikini top ($250 to $300) and custom-made choker ($55) are available on Shapeways.com. Undaunted, the partners are planning another Kickstarter project. ''I like writing code, I like making interactive shapes, and I like thinking of how technologies impact what things are made of, I like bikinis,'' Ms. Fizel said in a phone interview.
Ms. Whitehead and Ms. Glenn have become go-to gurus for tips on how to succeed on Kickstarter. The entrepreneurs credit their fund-raising success to blogging a year before their start to gain support. The two social-media-savvy women update on Facebook, Twitter and the 3/5r 4/5evolution apparel Web site every step, from sourcing the 100 percent recyclable fabric to shots of the workers at the North Carolina factory. They, along with two interns, are on a summer road trip in a mobile pop-up shop van from Vancouver to San Francisco, hoping to spark conversations about fashion and the environment. The journey will be documented in film and photos.
Kickstarter projects like Versalette are a window into the minutia of how things are actually made. ''We are so used to the global supply chain, we don't know how things are created,'' Mr. Strickler of Kickstarter said. ''They just arrive on our shelves.''
But getting financing is only one step in a long road. Ms. Glenn and Ms. Whitehead have had a couple of setbacks, including having to push back their April delivery date to backers. Organic cotton drawstrings were back ordered; they had to wait for available time at a sewing factory.
The partners were upfront about their missteps, admitting that they were babes in the woods. ''And they also know that because we update so often, they know we are working our hardest to get them the best possible product we possibly can,'' Ms. Glenn said. ''You have backers, but they get your story and get what you are trying to do.''

HEADLINE: The Biggest Rival for a Congresswoman From Brooklyn Isn't Even on the Ballot

BYLINE: By SARAH WHEATON

 BODY:
Councilman Erik M. Dilan may be the best-known candidate seeking to oust Nydia M. Velazquez, a 10-term Democratic congresswoman from Brooklyn, in next week's primary. But to hear her talk about the race, it sounds as though her opponent is Vito J. Lopez, the head of the Brooklyn Democratic Party.
Ms. Velazquez, 59, attributes Mr. Dilan's bid to win the party nomination directly on her longtime feud with Assemblyman Lopez. Congressional districts were redrawn this year to reflect the 2010 census, and now, with the boundaries of her district changed significantly, that gives ''the party boss the feeling that if he's going to take me on, this is the chance,'' she said. 
Ms. Velazquez, who embraces the nickname ''la Luchadora,'' or fighter, claims her own battle with Mr. Lopez began when she split with him over re-electing a judge 10 years ago. Mr. Lopez rejects that.
''I've never been supportive of her,'' Mr. Lopez said, ''based on the fact that she's not willing to sit down and have a dialogue on community issues.''
Mr. Dilan, 38, said his timing was indeed influenced by redistricting, but not by Mr. Lopez, his political patron. A son of State Senator Martin M. Dilan, Erik Dilan cannot run again for City Council next year because of term limits.
Ms. Velazquez and Mr. Dilan plan to debate on NY1 on Friday, but they are already sparring. They have traded barbs over which one has more effectively delivered money to local projects. And Mr. Dilan accused Ms. Velazquez of inadequately supporting Israel, prompting her to bring forth a torrent of endorsements featuring Jewish Democrats, including former Mayor Edward I. Koch.
Also planning to debate is Dan O'Connor, 33, an economist whose politics lean libertarian. A fourth candidate, George Martinez, 38, is an Occupy Wall Street activist and hip-hop artist who has protested NY1's decision not to include him.
The district they are seeking to represent -- the state's Seventh Congressional District -- stretches from Woodhaven in Queens, through Williamsburg, and includes Chinatown, Brooklyn Heights, and Park Slope to Sunset Park. A plurality of the district voters are Hispanic, but this year, as a result of redistricting, the district also includes much of the Satmar Hasidic community. The leaders of that community's largest sect are aligned with Mr. Lopez, who represents Williamsburg in Albany, and he said he was ''pulling out all my resources'' to help Mr. Dilan win Jewish voters.
Turnout is expected to be low, because Tuesday will mark the first statewide June primary in 40 years -- so the Hasidic community could be important, particularly because its members tend to vote at a higher rate than the general population.
Ms. Velazquez has been campaigning aggressively. On Monday morning, she was surrounded by children and cameras in front of the Jonathan Williams Day Care Center on Roebling Street in Williamsburg. Dressed in black to acknowledge the recent death of her mother, she talked about her efforts to secure federal financing for child care.
The congresswoman later campaigned in Chinatown, where she talked of her longstanding advocacy of immigration reform and, in an apparent reference to Mr. O'Connor's ability to speak Chinese, dismissed the idea that a candidate can serve that community better than she has just because he is fluent in its dialects.
Ms. Velazquez, who was born in Puerto Rico, moved to the Red Hook waterfront amid her recent divorce. Her home is about two blocks outside of the reconfigured Congressional district, but she has promised to move into the district. She received a master's degree from New York University, and adores the stylish Smith Street restaurants that fostered the Brooklyn dining renaissance.
Mr. Dilan is also of Puerto Rican heritage, but was raised in Bushwick, and he and his wife are now raising his own two children there. He went to Brooklyn public schools and earned an associate's degree from St. John's University. On the City Council, he earned a reputation as a consensus builder, said Councilman Stephen Levin, a Dilan friend and Lopez protege. ''He doesn't toot his own horn,'' he said.
Nonetheless, Mr. Dilan is confident that he can serve the district better than a well-connected incumbent who has served as a chairwoman of both the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Andrew M. Cuomo's campaign for governor.
''I would feel comfortable putting up my network against hers,'' Mr. Dilan said.
On Saturday, as Mr. Dilan and Mr. Levin met with Marguerite Scott, president of the Gowanus Houses Tenants Association, Ms. Scott said that she did not know anything about the Velazquez-Lopez feud, but that she was going to back Mr. Dilan, who had taken notes on leaking buildings during their meeting. ''I like the way he talks,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Money Market Funds Still At Risk, S.E.C. Chief Says

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Despite changes made in the wake of the financial crisis, money market funds remain vulnerable to runs by panicked investors seeking to withdraw their money, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to tell a Senate committee Thursday.
The only reason that more of the funds have not been besieged by investor withdrawals over the years is that fund sponsors, the companies that market and manage the portfolios, have put forward their cash to shore up the funds on more than 300 occasions since 1970, Mary L. Schapiro, the chairwoman, is expected to say. 
The 300 bailouts of parts of money market fund portfolios are more than previously known, although the S.E.C. did not release details of its figures before the Senate Banking Committee hearing Thursday.
The number was first reported Wednesday by The Wall Street Journal. In 2010, Moody's Investors Service reported that more than 200 money market funds in the United States and Europe received cash infusions or other support from their sponsors from 1980 through 2009.
It is not clear, however, that those numbers are significantly different. The Moody's study counted multiple infusions into one fund as one incident, while the S.E.C.'s characterization of ''occasions'' implies it counted each intervention as an incident. The commission's study also extended at least 12 years beyond the range of Moody's.
However many bailouts have occurred, Ms. Schapiro is expected to strongly assert that the $2.5 trillion invested in money market funds remains vulnerable to losses that could threaten the entire financial system, according to her written testimony, which was released Wednesday.
Ms. Schapiro has been backing more changes that she says will strengthen the funds and make them less vulnerable, but she has apparently been unable to persuade a majority on the five-member commission to join her.
The proposed changes include requiring money market funds to use floating net asset values to report their performance, rather than the fixed $1 a share that they use now, or to require the funds to maintain a capital buffer to stabilize their values. Also being considered are restrictions or fees on investor withdrawals.
Similar proposals, which are fiercely opposed by the mutual fund industry's primary trade group, the Investment Company Institute, were also outlined in an April report by a committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, of which the S.E.C. is a member.
But three S.E.C. commissioners quickly disavowed the report, in a statement that said it ''does not reflect the views and input of a majority of the commission,'' referring to the S.E.C. The statement was signed by two commissioners nominated by Republicans, Troy A. Paredes and Daniel M. Gallagher, and a third, Luis A. Aguilar, often a swing vote on commission proposals.
Paul Schott Stevens, president and chief executive of the Investment Company Institute, who is also scheduled to testify at the Senate committee hearing, said in an interview that his group recently surveyed institutional investors that are heavy users of money market funds.
''A vast majority of them said they will not use money funds any longer'' if the S.E.C. sets a floating net asset value, he said. That and other proposals, like redemption restrictions, ''are likely to spell the end of money market funds as we know them.''
The proposed changes to money market rules are a response to a September 2008 run on funds that was caused by heavy losses in the Reserve Primary Fund. The fund's net asset value ''broke the buck,'' or fell below $1 a share. The losses were tied to securities issued by Lehman Brothers and held in the fund's portfolio.
In a few days that September, investors, many of them large institutions, like pension funds, withdrew $300 billion from prime money market funds, roughly 14 percent of assets. The panic contributed to a virtual shutdown of the market for short-term debt issued by companies and municipalities.
In response to those losses, the S.E.C. in 2010 adopted rules that mandated liquidity requirements, improved credit standards and reduced maturities in portfolios. Those were tested last summer, as Congress haggled over raising the debt ceiling and investors worried about a possible downgrade of the nation's credit rating.
Ms. Schapiro is expected to tell the committee that although only $100 billion was withdrawn from the funds in June 2011, shareholders retain the incentive to run for the exits.

HEADLINE: Blacks Miss Out As Jobs Market Rebounds in City

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN; Aaron Edwards and Eric P. Newcomer contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For months now, New York officials have been highlighting how the city has regained all the jobs lost during the long recession and then some. But by several measures, the city's recovery has left black New Yorkers behind.
More than half of all of African-Americans and other non-Hispanic blacks in the city who were old enough to work had no job at all this year, according to an analysis of employment data compiled by the federal Labor Department. And when black New Yorkers lose their jobs, they spend a full year, on average, trying to find new jobs -- far longer than New Yorkers of other races.
Nationally, the employment outlook for blacks has begun to brighten: there were about one million more black Americans with jobs in May than there were a year earlier, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.
But that is not the case in New York City, where the decline in employment since the recession began here, in 2008, has been much steeper for blacks than for white or Hispanic residents, said James Parrott, chief economist for the Fiscal Policy Institute, a liberal research group. 
One problem, said David R. Jones, the president and chief executive of the Community Service Society of New York, is that blacks were overrepresented in fields that suffered the most in the downturn, including government agencies, construction and manufacturing.
''It's being in the wrong place in the economy, so the recovery is not trickling down to these workers,'' Mr. Jones said.
Kevin Starkes, 53, who is black and lives in the South Bronx, said he had been trying for about 10 weeks to find work as an accountant.
''Employers are getting more for less,'' said Mr. Starkes, who was at a Workforce1 Career Center in Harlem on Wednesday. ''People who used to get a job with a bachelor's degree now need a master's. I just think that's the state of the economy right now.''
Mr. Jones said he was also troubled by the inability of less-skilled and less-educated workers to find jobs for long periods. For example, he said, his agency, which provides services to poor and low-income New Yorkers, found that about half of the people holding jobs as security guards had bachelor's degrees or had attended college. That was up from about 26 percent six years ago, he said.
''The wage didn't go up,'' Mr. Jones said. ''This is a low-wage job. It pays $10 an hour with no health insurance.''
The dim prospects have caused the number of blacks in the city characterized by the Labor Department as ''discouraged workers'' -- those who have given up looking for jobs after long-term unemployment -- to triple since 2008, before the recession hit, the numbers show.
Four years ago, there were about the same number of discouraged blacks and whites in the city. But since then, the number of discouraged black workers has grown to almost 40,000, from about 13,000, while the number of discouraged whites increased to about 22,000, from about 12,000.
Latoya Ingram, 33, who lives in Harlem, said she had been looking for full-time work since 2009. In that time, she said, she had sent off more than 1,000 copies of her resume.
Unlike some other unemployed New Yorkers interviewed, Ms. Ingram, who is black and earned a bachelor's degree in marketing from Syracuse University in 2001, said she believed her race was a factor in her inability to land a job.
''I could be wrong, but I've had interviews, and they seem really, really interested,'' she said.
''Then they see me in person and they're not that interested,'' added Ms. Ingram, who has been collecting $215 a week in unemployment benefits. ''I think it's a combination of being black and overweight: they think you are lazy.''
According to Dr. Parrott's analysis of the federal data, fewer than half -- 49.2 percent -- of all black women of working age in the city had jobs in the year that ended in May. That was about the same rate for black men in the same period, as well as in the first four months of 2012.
That less-than-half measure in a statistic known as the employment-to-population ratio covers all black New Yorkers, whether they are seeking work or not. It is down from 55 percent in the 12 months that ended in May 2008, when the city's economy was still in high gear, Dr. Parrott found. Nationally, about 53 percent of all blacks and 60 percent of whites are working.
Not all economists are convinced that blacks are lagging as far behind in the recovery as Dr. Parrott's numbers indicate. But they agree that the most likely cause of any disparity is the type of businesses that are growing and those that are cutting back.
Frank Braconi, chief economist for the city comptroller's office, pointed out that a lot of the job gains in the city had come in professional and business services, like law and accounting, fields in which blacks tended to be underrepresented.
''African-Americans in New York City basically inhabit the middle market in the labor force in terms of wages and education, not the low end,'' Dr. Braconi said. ''And the middle market has been weak.''
Dr. Braconi and other economists have been puzzling over the recent divergence in the results of the two surveys the Labor Department conducts each month. Employers have been reporting healthy increases to their payrolls all year, prompting some economists to call the current rate of hiring to be unprecedented and city officials to pronounce the local economy to be rebounding faster and stronger than the nation's.
But the monthly surveys of city residents have produced a persistently high unemployment rate for the city. It rose to 9.7 percent in May, not far off the 10 percent level at which it peaked during the recession.
Wayne Nesmith, 45, a Bronx resident who is African-American, is already trying to head off unemployment when the financing runs out for his job as a clinical associate at the Lander Center for Educational Research of Touro College. He said he found the job market to be ''pretty adverse,'' even though he had a degree in economics from the City University of New York and two master's degrees.
''I definitely believe it is more adverse for African-Americans,'' Mr. Nesmith said. But, he added, ''You don't give up, and you don't give in.''

HEADLINE: Wall Street Dips Slightly on Fed Decision

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUSER

 BODY:
Wall Street gave a tepid response on Wednesday to the Federal Reserve's decision to extend a program intended to drive down long-term interest rates, as analysts questioned just how far the measure would go in bolstering economic growth.
The Fed's policy-making committee announced around midday that it was extending the central bank's asset-purchase program, which had been set to expire at the end of June, by buying about $267 billion in longer-term Treasury securities over the next six months. It would use money raised by selling some of its current holdings of short-term Treasuries, maintaining its portfolio at roughly the same size. 
Initially, the stock market sold off, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling more than 90 points, before prices bounced higher and then fell again.
By the end of trading, the key market indicators had recouped their losses and were barely changed. The Dow closed down 12.94 points, or 0.1 percent, at 12,824.39, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slipped 2.29 points, or 0.2 percent, to 1,355.69. The Nasdaq composite index eked out a gain of just 0.69 point, to 2,930.45.
Analysts attributed the market reaction to traders' hopes that the Fed would do more, considering that the American economy is still growing very slowly and the economic crisis in Europe is showing no signs of abating.
Anthony Valeri, a fixed-income investment strategist for LPL Financial, said the Fed's decision to extend its stimulus program had generally been anticipated in the financial markets, despite the hopes for a more aggressive move. As a result, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 9/32, to 100 29/32, while its yield rose to 1.65 percent, compared with 1.62 percent late Tuesday.
The market was essentially saying that ''this is not going to do much to help the prospects for the U.S. economy,'' Mr. Valeri said. ''I think the markets had built in expectations of a more forceful Fed.''
Paul Zemsky, the head of asset allocation at ING Investment Management, said stock prices climbed on Tuesday as some investors expected the Fed to conduct a larger bond-buying program to spur the economy.
''I think the market was a little overly optimistic,'' he said.
The Fed also said that it expected the American economy would continue to grow at a ''moderate pace,'' but it noted that ''growth in employment has slowed in recent months,'' even as inflation has declined.
Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, said that the Federal Reserve had downgraded its assessment of the economy, particularly by saying that consumer spending, which provides about 70 percent of economic activity, had slowed.
Analysts also questioned how effective the bond-buying program would be on stimulating growth and lending. Steve Blitz, chief economist with ITG Investment Research, said it was unclear whether the measure would hold down interest rates as it increased borrowing at the longer end of the curve.
''In sum, the Fed did more than we expected in kind, but in spirit came through as we thought -- do the least necessary to sustain hope among equity market investors,'' he said in a commentary.
Still, the Fed intended to show that it was prepared to act. After the announcement, Fed officials said they expected the economy to expand by 1.9 percent to 2.4 percent in 2012, down from their forecast in April of 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent.
''We are prepared to do what is necessary,'' the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said in a news conference. ''We are prepared to provide support for the economy.''
He also said the Fed needed more information about the sovereign debt crisis in Europe before taking any other steps.
Borrowing costs have been soaring for Spain and Italy. On Wednesday, the 10-year Spanish bond was yielding 6.659 percent, a retreat from more than 7 percent, and the Italian 10-year was at 5.740 percent.
Stocks in Europe traded slightly higher at their close, which came before the Fed announcement. The Euro Stoxx index closed up 0.4 percent. The CAC 40 in Paris rose 0.3 percent, while the DAX in Germany gained 0.5 percent.

HEADLINE: EBay Plans Data Center That Will Run on Alternative Energy Fuel Cells

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ

 BODY:
EBay plans to build a data center to handle its billions of dollars in retail transactions that will draw its power from alternative energy fuel cells rather than the national power grid, which is heavily dependent on coal plants.
It will be the first major tech company to use alternative power as a primary source for energy-hungry data centers, although the new center will connect to the electricity grid for backup. Environmental groups have issued a series of rebukes to Internet companies because of their heavy reliance on coal-fired power to run their centers.
Some companies already use alternative energy to run the data centers that power social networks, stream entertainment or manage commercial transactions, but only as a supplemental source. 
EBay plans to use about six million watts of power generated on-site by fuel cells, which are a substantially cleaner and more efficient source of energy than coal, in its new data center in South Jordan, Utah. The company also operates PayPal, the online payment service, out of the South Jordan site. Bloom Energy, a private company in Sunnyvale, Calif., will make the fuel cells.
The new center will double the size of an existing data center there, which will still be on the grid. The grid will serve mainly as a backup power source for the new center. Even so, the fuel cells will account for less than 15 percent of the energy needs of all eBay data centers around the country -- a clue that the industry is likely to remain deeply dependent on the grid and its energy mix indefinitely.
''Does it have risk? Sure. Did it require investment? Sure. But it's an investment and a risk that is worth taking,'' said John Donahoe, president and chief executive of eBay. Mr. Donahoe and KR Sridhar, co-founder and chief executive of Bloom Energy, confirmed the fuel cell plans. EBay signed an agreement this week with Bloom for the fuel cells.
Haresh Kamath, program manager for energy storage and distributed generation at the Electric Power Research Institute, said that it was still unknown how the fuel cells would hold up.
''Purely from a power-reliability standpoint, it'll be interesting to see how this proceeds,'' Mr. Kamath said. ''I'm glad that somebody is trying to do this.''
Mr. Sridhar sought to dispel those doubts, saying that the Bloom cells were specifically designed so that no simple string of failures could bring a system down. Thirty Bloom cells will be installed at the eBay data center.
Arrays of various sizes are in use by more than 20 major organizations, including FedEx, Wal-Mart, AT&T and Kaiser Permanente. But Peter Gross, vice president of mission critical systems at Bloom, said that nothing was comparable to the data center redesign undertaken by eBay. That redesign, Mr. Gross said, is ''an extraordinary step to do something that has never been done before.''
Dean Nelson, the vice president of global foundation services at eBay, who is in charge of data centers, said that the shift demanded a radical redesign, since nearly all data centers now draw their main power from the grid and must have complex backup systems -- absent in the new concept -- available in case of a blackout.
''It is really throwing out the way people have done it in the past,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''You can build a better mousetrap.''
The cells are essentially large batteries whose charge is maintained by the hydrocarbon energy contained in natural gas. Fuel cells by various manufacturers have become more economically competitive with grid power in recent years as the price of natural gas has plummeted.
Although the Bloom cells function at high temperatures internally, the charge is maintained by chemical reactions, not combustion, so the efficiencies are much higher than at an ordinary power plant. The reactions produce mainly carbon dioxide and water. By generating power on-site, the fuel cells also save energy that is normally dissipated as electricity runs though transmission lines.
The Bloom cells can also run on so-called biogas, a byproduct of landfills and animal waste at large industrial farms. Annie Lescroart, an eBay spokeswoman, said that in another bow to the environment, the company would pay a premium to enable the production of biogas somewhere in the United States in amounts comparable to its gas usage in South Jordan.
EBay relies on large amounts of computing power to carry out its mission of connecting buyers and sellers among its 102 million active users. The company estimates that through its services, a men's necktie is sold every 25 seconds, a pair of women's jeans every 17 seconds, and a piece of golf equipment every 7.1 seconds. It handled $69 billion in transactions in 2011.
In all, Mr. Nelson said, transactions flow through eBay's computers at the rate of roughly $2,000 a second. Those computers use large amounts of energy. Ebay estimates that its data centers will consume an average of 43 million watts in 2012. The Electric Power Research Institute estimates that in the United States, 1 million watts powers about 600 homes.
Particularly on the Utah grid, that energy is supplied mostly by coal power, according to the research institute. ''The energy mix there is what it is, and it's not pretty,'' said Gary Cook, an information technology analyst at Greenpeace who has assessed the industry's energy appetite.
Moving some of that load to fuel cells from the grid, Mr. Cook said, would be a major shift. ''Other companies would be wise, if they're serious about their carbon footprint, to do so as well,'' he said.

HEADLINE: In Defense of The Decorator

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
DONNA MAY WOODS is trying to explain the complexities of a hot-pink and turquoise silk brocatelle.
''If you've ever been to camp or rehab,'' she begins encouragingly, using the humble potholder you might make there as a reference for a rapid-fire tutorial on the history of fine textiles that ranges from the practices of Italy's 15th-century mills to the mountains of Afghanistan, which in the decorating world is known less as a training ground for terrorists than as a producer of ikat, the voguish, woozy-looking fabric.
The brocatelle is one of hundreds of fabric samples pinned like bright flags to foam-core boards and stacked in swirling piles that cover every surface of her office at Clarence House, the half-century-old fabric company in the Decoration and Design Building in Manhattan.
That's where Ms. Woods, a textile designer, has been working on a line of luxury fabrics that will make its debut early next year. Bob Appelbaum, the president of Clarence House, believed there was a hole in the market at the very high end. In other words, there was no product quite right for those who have an appetite for $1,000-a-yard silk damasks woven in 200-year-old European mills. 
''It is not unusual for our clients to have a chair that's worth a million dollars,'' Ms. Woods said. The fabric, she added, ''needs to match that.''
With the economies of entire countries in smoking ruins, it would seem an odd time for such a venture. But as economists like Paul Krugman point out, life at the top has never been better, as the superwealthy have doubled their share of income in the last three decades. What this means for society as a whole is troublesome; what it means for the arcane world that Ms. Woods and others inhabit, the Galapagos-like ecosystem of artists and artisans, vendors and installers (the upholsterers, decorative painters, furniture finishers, antiques dealers and, yes, the decorators who employ them all) is that extinction has been put aside, once again.
Decorating is a profession that often ends up as a punch line in a takedown of the 1 percent. But it remains the support system for an entire industry of makers, the manufacturers, craftspeople and artisans whose skills can stretch back to traditions hatched centuries ago, in much the same way the fashion business used to support those in the garment district.
But despite the rising fortunes of a few, this is a curious, and not altogether stable, moment for a profession that has been repeatedly battered in the last two decades, its numbers horribly thinned, first by AIDS, then by three recessions.
Add to that a paradigm shift away from the old decorator-assisted living for those at the high end, engineered by years of relentless D.I.Y. cable programming, along with shelter guides like Martha Stewart Living and the late Domino. They exhorted young money -- new money -- to do it themselves, while promoting the fortunes of a curious breed of designer celebrities you'd have to have serious judgment issues to let loose in your house (cue Bravo's ''Million Dollar Decorators,'' now gearing up for its second season).
All these forces have created a climate in which, as Stephen Drucker, who has been editor in chief of House Beautiful and Martha Stewart Living, put it: ''It's not so cool anymore to credit the decorator. You're supposed to have curated your own eclectic, wonderful life, not order Mario by the yard.''
Which is not to say that the big brands aren't working as hard as they ever did.
At 76, Mario Buatta is still answering his own phone, as he always has, to take care of clients like Mariah Carey and the financier Wilbur Ross. Bunny Williams, who though only 67 is the decorating world's grande dame, noted that while business has steadied in the last year, ''no one is taking it for granted,'' she said. ''Everyone is working harder than ever.''
Ms. Williams said that on any given day, ''There might be 300 or more people doing something for our jobs: the people who make the down pillows, the cabinetmaker from Salisbury, Conn., who can be a stay-at-home dad because of his craft, the furniture restorer. It goes on and on. And their work is what makes our work unique: we can do things that are unique, and not mass produced.''
William Sofield, the Princeton-educated designer of Tom Ford's sleek emporia, likes to say that he has ''resuscitated every trade that's about to die.''
He ticked them off: eggshell marquetry in an apartment on Fifth Avenue. Elaborate decorative painting, like the silver leaf on the bronze elevator doors in the Soho Grand, painted by the artist Nancy Lorenz after the elevators had been installed, ''which meant she was painting at the same time the doors were opening and closing.'' In a new building he designed on East 79th Street for the Brodsky Organization, bricks are being hand-laid, old-school-style, by New York City masons; the door hardware comes from P. E. Guerin, a foundry in the West Village; limestone relief sculptures designed by Mr. Sofield on a clay model in his dining room are being made by an Indiana sculptor from Indiana limestone.
While marshaling the efforts of what might be hundreds of artisans into a single project, some decorators find they are behaving more like C.E.O.'s pitching their shareholders. Brian McCarthy, a Parish-Hadley alumnus with impeccable art-history credentials (he is the only decorator since Elsie de Wolfe who has been allowed to alter the interiors of the Frick Collection), said lately that he's more engaged in conversations about an interior's investment potential than in conversations about how the space will feel.
''Because of what happened in the art market,'' he said, ''everyone wants to know, 'Is it a good investment?' ''
Not that this isn't a valid question, he said, detailing a long back-and-forth with a client about a Lucite pedestal for an armillary versus a cast-bronze one (the Lucite option, less costly, won), which this reporter half-listened to while frantically Googling the word ''armillary.''
Mr. McCarthy, whose knowledge of European antiques is formidable and fascinating, can defend an interior in precise detail: why a chocolate-brown lacquer ceiling reinvigorates the architecture of a room, how the shape of that armillary required a very particular volume beneath it, why the carpet must be sisal and the Venetian plaster tone-on-tone, why the depth of the sofa should be exactly this number of inches, and so forth.
Yet price has entered the calculus of that narrative in a new way. No longer is the price a simple matter of a client's budget. It now includes an anticipation that the investment will accrue value down the road.
''It comes up all the time,'' said Darren Henault, another conjurer of luxurious interiors. ''People say, 'What am I going to get out of it, what's my return?' '' To that end, Mr. Henault promises to price a job based on the investment potential of a property.
''If a couple just purchased an apartment for $1,000 a square foot, and they plan on staying there for 5 or 10 years, maybe they can sell it for $1,500 a square foot,'' he said. ''That's a budget. It doesn't come from nowhere, it comes from the market. Then you back into it. For $500 a square foot, you can't get gold fixtures or hand-painted Gracie wallpaper, but you can do O.K.''
Mr. Henault has created a software program to track a project's expenses down to the last penny and fixture, which can be updated on a secure server by each client. At the start of a project, he said: ''We itemize everything that's going to be in a room, and put them on a spreadsheet. We give each item a high number and a low number'' -- ranging from, as he puts it, ''cheap and cheerful to European antiques'' -- ''then we start looking at things with the client, visiting the showrooms, and it's the client's responsibility to stay on budget. It's absurdly simple. Business 101.''
But it's a necessary tool, he said, in a business freighted with assumptions that the work of a decorator is somehow illegitimate.
''Why is my time any less valuable than anyone else's?'' Mr. Henault said. ''Because I'm choosing wallpaper? Well, if you think choosing wallpaper is insignificant, then you go do it. Why is the way I run my business any different than the way a lawyer or hedge fund manager runs theirs?''
Like many of his peers, Mr. Henault bills hourly for his services: meetings with clients, phone calls, shopping for objects. Then he charges a percentage markup on the things he buys.
''I'm not a discount shop, I'm not here so you can get the cheapest price,'' he said. ''I'm here to spend your money well.''
It is true that the money for decorating is still big, said Scott Salvator, who counts 11,000 vendors connected to his 20-year-old firm. With a renovation, the cost can be equal to half the purchase price of a property, he added: ''But it's spread out over time, over years, and the lion's share goes to the vendors. What decorator lives like Givenchy or Valentino? If you look at the hours put into a lampshade, you could be working at Burger King.''
Margaret Russell, editor in chief of Architectural Digest, recalled the drama when her friend Michael Smith decorated the Oval Office, for a reveal just before Labor Day in 2010.
After the earth-tones critique -- ''the audacity of taupe,'' Arianna Huffington described its decor, cunningly, in The New York Times -- what really irritated Ms. Russell was the carping about cost (which in any case was paid for by a private fund, as every White House decoration since the first has been). ''I remember Ann Curry on the 'Today' show saying, 'That must be expensive, how much did it cost?' implying that it was a great deal,'' she said. ''In truth, everything was the quality and cost that it should be: it's the president's office. What's most important, though, is that everything in that office was made in America.''
Like the president's new rug, which was made in Grand Rapids, Mich. Or the hand-painted wallpaper, made by artists at the Elizabeth Dow Studio in Sag Harbor, N.Y. Or a pair of lamps made by Christopher Spitzmiller, a Manhattan ceramist. (American labor, as both political parties like to point out, does not come cheap. Yet no one wants to pay that bill.)
''Everyone wants their home to reflect themselves, but how do you do that in a time of globalization?'' said Daniella Ohad Smith, a design historian. ''How do you create your own taste, if everyone has access to the same goods? Also, not everyone has an aesthetic sense, but everyone wants a beautiful home.''
A stunning book published recently by Rizzoli, ''Be Your Own Decorator'' by Susanna Salk, is filled with the glossy projects of high-end designers like Celerie Kemble, Miles Redd, Katie Ridder and others. Ms. Salk's intention is to draw inspiration from the pros. But page after page, its perfect vignettes unintentionally make the point that civilians like you and I may be incapable of replicating a skilled decorator's work, in the same way that the pages of Domino magazine used to elicit a sort of panicked malaise in some readers.
''The ability to walk into an empty room and see it finished in their heads -- that is a gift that most people do not have,'' Mr. Drucker said. ''I certainly don't. It's a crazy, God-given special gift. Yet decorators have been targets of ridicule forever.''
Mr. Sofield, for his part, eschews the word ''decorating'' entirely.
''I don't like it, I think it's pejorative,'' he said. ''I prefer to use words like movable'' -- to refer to interior design -- ''and stationary,'' for architecture.
And for the record, Mr. Sofield is of the opinion that decorating (er, the movable stuff) gives a better return than art.
''No matter what,'' he said, ''at least you can sit on it or eat off it.''

HEADLINE: Shareholder Votes on Pay To Be Binding in Britain

BYLINE: By JULIA WERDIGIER

 BODY:
LONDON - Britain will make shareholder votes on executive pay binding next year as part of a set of measures announced by the government on Wednesday to rein in excessive remuneration. 
Vince Cable, the business secretary, presented the measures to Parliament on Wednesday, saying they would provide shareholders with new powers to hold companies accountable on their pay practices and increase transparency. The rules are expected to be approved by Parliament and then become law in October 2013.
''At a time when the global economy remains fragile, it is neither sustainable nor justifiable to see directors' pay rising at 10 percent a year, while the performance of listed companies lags behind and many employees are having their pay cut or frozen,'' Mr. Cable said.
Under the new rules, companies listed in Britain would have to gain majority support for their executive remuneration from their shareholders at least every three years or more often if they decide to increase pay. Companies will also no longer be able to pay departing directors more than shareholders have agreed.
But the measures, which also include the mandatory disclosure of a single figure for executives' total annual pay, were criticized by the opposition Labor Party as not going far enough and being a watered down version of initial proposals.
Chuka Umunna, a Labor Party member of Parliament, welcomed the binding vote and other measures but accused Mr. Cable of doing a U-turn on original proposals. ''Having proposed an annual vote, he now seeks one every three years,'' Mr. Umunna said. ''Is it not the case that this will simply incentivize boards to draft policy as broadly as possible?''
Shareholder opposition against remuneration practices has been building in Britain, the United States and elsewhere after some companies continued to hand out large paychecks even though their share prices had declined. Pay practices at the insurance company Aviva, the oil producer Cairn Energy and the advertising giant WPP were rejected recently by more than half of investors.
Mr. Cable said that companies would have to report a single figure of total pay for executives after complaints that remuneration reports were too confusing and deferred bonuses or long-term incentive plans made it harder to compare annual pay.
The measures, which are the result of months of consultations with investor groups and companies, won support from business groups. John Cridland, the director general of the Confederation of British Industry, said the measures struck ''a balance, by giving shareholders increased transparency on pay and providing ways to hold boards to account, without getting them bogged down in day-to-day micro-management.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Relief in Every Window, but Global Worry Too

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL and ANDREW W. LEHREN

 BODY:
In the ramshackle apartment blocks and sooty concrete homes that line the dusty roads of urban India, there is a new status symbol on proud display. An air-conditioner has become a sign of middle-class status in developing nations, a must-have dowry item.
It is cheaper than a car, and arguably more life-changing in steamy regions, where cooling can make it easier for a child to study or a worker to sleep.
But as air-conditioners sprout from windows and storefronts across the world, scientists are becoming increasingly alarmed about the impact of the gases on which they run. All are potent agents of global warming. 
Air-conditioning sales are growing 20 percent a year in China and India, as middle classes grow, units become more affordable and temperatures rise with climate change. The potential cooling demands of upwardly mobile Mumbai, India, alone have been estimated to be a quarter of those of the United States.
Air-conditioning gases are regulated primarily though a 1987 treaty called the Montreal Protocol, created to protect the ozone layer. It has reduced damage to that vital shield, which blocks cancer-causing ultraviolet rays, by mandating the use of progressively more benign gases. The oldest CFC coolants, which are highly damaging to the ozone layer, have been largely eliminated from use; and the newest ones, used widely in industrialized nations, have little or no effect on it.
But these gases have an impact the ozone treaty largely ignores. Pound for pound, they contribute to global warming thousands of times more than does carbon dioxide, the standard greenhouse gas.
The leading scientists in the field have just calculated that if all the equipment entering the world market uses the newest gases currently employed in air-conditioners, up to 27 percent of all global warming will be attributable to those gases by 2050.
So the therapy to cure one global environmental disaster is now seeding another. ''There is precious little time to do something, to act,'' said Stephen O. Andersen, the co-chairman of the treaty's technical and economic advisory panel.
The numbers are all moving in the wrong direction.
Atmospheric concentrations of the gases that replaced CFCs, known as HCFCs, which are mildly damaging to the ozone, are still rising rapidly at a time when many scientists anticipated they should have been falling as the treaty is phasing them out. The levels of these gases, the mainstay of booming air-conditioning sectors in the developing world, have more than doubled in the past two decades to record highs, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
And concentrations of the newer, ozone-friendly gases are also rising meteorically, because industrialized countries began switching to them a decade ago. New room air-conditioners in the United States now use an HFC coolant called 410a, labeled ''environmentally friendly'' because it spares the ozone. But its warming effect is 2,100 times that of carbon dioxide. And the treaty cannot control the rise of these coolants because it regulates only ozone-depleting gases.
The treaty timetable requires dozens of developing countries, including China and India, to also begin switching next year from HCFCs to gases with less impact on the ozone. But the United States and other wealthy nations are prodding them to choose ones that do not warm the planet. This week in Rio de Janeiro, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is attending the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, also known as Rio+20, where proposals to gradually eliminate HFCs for their warming effect are on the provisional agenda.
But she faces resistance because the United States is essentially telling the other nations to do what it has not: to leapfrog this generation of coolants. The trouble is, there are currently no readily available commercial ozone-friendly alternatives for air-conditioners that do not also have a strong warming effect -- though there are many on the horizon.
Nearly all chemical and air-conditioning companies -- including DuPont, the American chemical giant, and Daikin, one of Japan's leading appliance manufacturers -- have developed air-conditioning appliances and gases that do not contribute to global warming. Companies have even erected factories to produce them.
But these products require regulatory approvals before they can be sold, and the development of new safety standards, because the gases in them are often flammable or toxic. And with profits booming from current cooling systems and no effective regulation of HFCs, there is little incentive for countries or companies to move the new designs to market.
''There are no good solutions right now -- that's why countries are grappling, tapping in the dark,'' said Rajendra Shende, the recently retired head of the Paris-based United Nations ozone program, who now runs the Terre Policy Center in Pune, India.
An Unanticipated Problem
The 25-year-old Montreal Protocol is widely regarded as the most successful environmental treaty ever, essentially eliminating the use of CFC coolants, which are highly damaging to the ozone layer. Under its terms, wealthier countries shift away from each harmful gas first, and developing countries follow a decade or more later so that replacement technologies can be perfected and fall in price.
Concentrations of CFC-12, which had been growing rapidly since the 1960s, have tapered off since 2003, thanks to the treaty's strict phaseout schedule. In 2006, NASA scientists concluded that the ozone layer was on the mend.
But that sense of victory has been eclipsed by the potentially disastrous growth in emissions from the newer air-conditioning gases. While a healthier ozone layer itself leads to some warming, far more warming results from the tendency of these coolant gases to reflect back heat radiating off the Earth.
When the treaty set its rules in the mid-1980s, global warming was poorly understood, the cooling industry was anchored in the West, and demand for cooling was minuscule in developing nations.
That has clearly changed.
Jayshree Punjabi, a 40-year-old from Surat, was shopping for an air-conditioner at Vijay Sales in Mumbai on a recent afternoon. She bought her first one 10 years ago and now has three. ''Now almost every home in Surat has more than one,'' she said. ''The children see them on television and demand them.''
Refrigeration is also essential for these countries' shifting food supplies. ''When I was a kid in Delhi, veggies came from vendors on the street; now they all come from the supermarket,'' said Atul Bagai, an Indian citizen who is the United Nations ozone program's coordinator for South Asia.
In 2011, 55 percent of new air-conditioning units were sold in the Asia Pacific region, and the industry's production has moved there. Last year, China built more than 70 percent of the world's household air-conditioners, for domestic use and export. The most common coolant gas is HCFC-22. In 2010, China produced about seven times the amount of that gas as the United States.
With inexpensive HCFC-22 from Asia flooding the market, efforts to curb or eliminate its use have been undercut, even in the United States. For example, although American law now forbids the sale of new air-conditioners containing HCFC, stores have started selling empty components that can be filled with the cheap gas after installation, enabling its continued use.
Trying to Adapt the Treaty
During a four-day meeting in Montreal in April, about 200 representatives attending the protocol's executive committee meeting clashed over how to adapt to the changing circumstances. Should they be concerned with ozone protection, climate change or both?
As developing countries submitted plans to reduce reliance on HCFCs in order to win United Nations financing for the transition, delegations from richer nations rejected proposals that relied on HFCs, because of their warming effect. Canada raised a proposal that countries should use only compounds with low impact on global warming.
Phasing out HFCs by incorporating them into the treaty is one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce global warming, said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development.
But India, China and Brazil object that this could slow development and cost too much. All the acceptable substitutes under development for air-conditioners are either under patent, demand new equipment or require extensive new regulation and testing procedures. ''This appears simple, but it's not standard, and it imposes a new burden,'' said Wang Yong, of the Chinese delegation.
Said Suely Carvalho, the Brazilian-born chief of the United Nations Development Program's Montreal Protocol and Chemicals Unit: ''The developing countries are already struggling to phase out, and now you tell them, 'Don't do what we did.' You can see why they're upset.''
Commercial interests foster the stalemate. Though the protocol aggressively reduces the use of HCFC-22 for cooling, it restricts production on a slower, more lenient timetable, and as a result, output has grown more than 60 percent in the past decade. Even in the United States, HCFC-22 is still profitably manufactured for use in older appliances, export and a few other industrial purposes that do not create significant emissions, like making Teflon.
Politically influential manufacturers like Gujarat Fluorochemicals in India, Zhejiang Dongyang Chemical Company in China and Quimobasicos in Mexico (of which Honeywell owns 49 percent) have prospered by producing the coolant. They even receive lucrative subsidies from the United Nations for making it.
For their part, manufacturers are reluctant to hurry to market new technologies that are better for the climate, until they get a stronger signal of which ones countries will adopt, said Mack McFarland, an atmospheric scientist with DuPont.
Othmar Schwank, a Swiss environmental consultant who has advised the United Nations, said: ''In many countries, these targets will be very difficult to achieve. With appliances growing in India and China, everyone is making money, so they want to delay this as much as possible.''
Technologies Stalled
The Montreal Protocol originally gave the developing countries until 2040 to get rid of HCFCs, but its governing board accelerated that timetable in 2007. ''We saw consumption going through the roof,'' said Markus Wypior, of the German government agency GIZ Proklima. The new schedule says developing countries must ''stabilize'' consumption of HCFCs by Jan. 1, and reduce it by 10 percent by 2015.
But the industry is growing so fast that meeting the targets, which were based on consumption in 2009-10, would now require a 40 percent reduction from current use in India. Many countries, including India, are trying to satisfy their 2013 mandate with one-time fixes that do not involve the cooling sector -- for example, replacing HCFC-22 with another gas in making foam. Meeting the next reduction target, in 2015, is expected to be much harder.
In the meantime, the Montreal Protocol has started using its limited tools to prod developing countries moving from HCFCs toward climate-friendly solutions, offering a 25 percent bonus payment for plans that create less warming. Experts say that is not sufficient incentive for the drastic changes needed in machine design, servicing, manufacturing and regulation.
Promising technologies wait, stalled in the wings. In China and a few other countries, room air-conditioners using hydrocarbons -- which cause little warming or ozone depletion -- are already coming off assembly lines in small numbers but have not yet been approved for sale, in part because the chemicals are flammable.
Yet in Europe, refrigerators that cool with hydrocarbons have been in use for years, and some companies in the United States, like Pepsi and Ben and Jerry's, have recently converted in-store coolers from HFCs to hydrocarbons as part of sustainability plans.
In a statement, the United States Environmental Protection Agency said it had recently approved some of the new climate-friendly gases for car air-conditioning and refrigerators and is ''evaluating additional alternatives for other air-conditioning applications,'' most notably a newer HFC variant called R32.
But when will they be on the market? Even small steps forward have been frustrated.
Last year the European Union began requiring automakers to use climate-friendly coolants in cars, considered a relatively simple transition. A chemical called 1234yf was deemed suitable, and the tiny amounts of coolant in car air-conditioners make flammability and high cost less of a deterrent.
But this year, the European Union postponed the plan: Chinese factories that make the compound are still in the process of obtaining government registration. The patent, owned by Honeywell, is being disputed. And the German government has still not finished safety testing.
Said Mr. Wypior, whose agency is trying to promote climate-friendly air-conditioning industries in India and China: ''The technologies are available. They're well known. They're proven -- though not at scale. So why aren't we moving?''
Chilling Effect: Articles in this series will describe the impact of the rising demand for coolant gases, a growing contributor to global warming.
Correction: June 25, 2012, Monday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Thursday about coolant gases for air-conditioners that contribute to global warming misspelled the name of a Japanese manufacturer that has developed air-conditioners and gases that do not have that problem. It is Daikin, not Daiken.

HEADLINE: An Early Death but Perhaps Not a Surprise

BYLINE: By JACOB BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
THE bereaved reactions on Twitter came from all over: Kim Hastreiter, the editor of Paper Magazine; Bruce LaBruce, the independent film director; and Jake Shears of the Scissor Sisters, who called his recently departed friend ''brave'' and ''honest.''
The source of their grief? 
Erik Rhodes, 30, a 6-foot-4, 258-pound gay pornographic-film star who died last Thursday in Manhattan from a heart attack after a nearly decade-long career that had made him an unlikely celebrity in some New York social circles. He appeared regularly on Page Six, spent time with the designer Marc Jacobs, was profiled in magazines that had nothing to do with pornography, and shot an ad campaign for Loehmann's.
Over the last few years, he had also been the author of a harrowing (and frequently clever) Tumblr feed, on which he detailed his escapades escorting, his rampant steroid use and his stories of winding up in psychiatric wards after crystal meth binges. (The blog was taken down last weekend, shortly after news of his death ricocheted around the Internet.)
Mr. Rhodes, whose given name was James Naughtin, was signed to Falcon Video in 2004, and became one of a handful of recognizable faces in an era when the industry was going through a painful economic contraction, thanks to online file sharing and free pornography sites like Xtube.
''The gay porn audience often looks to a hulking macho fantasy, and he provided that,'' said Michael Musto, the Village Voice gossip columnist who was friendly with Mr. Rhodes. ''He was Thor, the Hulk and the rest of the 'Avengers' cast wrapped in a gay package. And the fashion connection and the fact that he had a brain elevated him from your everyday escort-slash-porn-god and gave him texture.''
Mickey Boardman, the editorial director of Paper, said, ''We would see him out all the time,'' adding: ''He was hilarious. He was totally self-aware, and the stories he would tell me were unbelievable.''
Mr. Rhodes grew up with his identical twin, Jon Naughtin, in Massapequa, N.Y., two children whose parents had a long and nasty divorce. Only Mr. Naughtin went to college, and Mr. Rhodes took a stream of low-paying jobs, working at a CVS and a sex-toy store, before moving into stripping and then pornographic films at 22.
At first, Mr. Naughtin, who is straight, was inclined to be open-minded about his brother's new career. ''I thought it was fine,'' he said. ''And I was a little naive about how much money he was making. I thought, 'If it pays the bills, why not?' ''
But as the Web replaced video stores as the delivery mechanism for adult content, Mr. Rhodes found his salary shrinking, even while his celebrity rose. And there were other problems.
''People faulted him for doing steroids, which was the thing that allowed him to be the ideal they wanted,'' said Samuel Colt, an actor who appeared with Mr. Rhodes on-screen and was a friend for the last several years of his life. ''And people were always trying to push drugs onto him.''
Things went from bad to worse. Mr. Rhodes got into fights with boyfriends, and the police would be called. Famous friends like Mr. Jacobs, who did not respond to calls for comment for this article, fell away. Mr. Rhodes went from using steroids to dealing them. And then, a few years ago, he tested positive for H.I.V.
According to Mr. Colt, Mr. Rhodes found this out when he went to shoot a scene for Randy Blue, a company that requires testing. ''They said, 'Your test results came back, and you're H.I.V. positive,' '' Mr. Colt said. Nevertheless, Randy Blue still managed to get Mr. Rhodes to film a solo scene that day, Mr. Colt said.
As the novelty of being in pornographic films wore off, Mr. Rhodes turned increasingly to the Internet, using his Tumblr feed and his Facebook page to discuss his sense of anguish. ''I feel so left out ... so alone,'' he wrote in a post just weeks ago.
On June 13, after a night in which Mr. Rhodes was hired along with another escort to perform for a wealthy client (according to text messages later read by his brother), the two men continued the evening on their own, having sex and doing drugs. But Mr. Rhodes quickly realized that he was not feeling well and cut the evening short.
Once home, he apparently went into cardiac arrest and was pronounced dead in a hospital shortly thereafter, his brother said.
For many years, Mr. Rhodes talked of an early death, sometimes joking, sometimes not. Now it was here.
Mr. Naughtin looks back with regret at the casual attitude he took when his brother told him he was going into pornography. ''I wouldn't have let him get into it,'' he said. ''I would say that's not a direction that can lead anywhere good.''
Correction: June 28, 2012, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article last Thursday about Erik Rhodes, the pornographic-film actor who was born James Naughtin, misspelled the given name of his twin brother. He is Jon Naughtin, not John.

HEADLINE: Romney's Personal Touch Pays Off With Donors

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's biggest donors and fund-raisers are descending on Utah's exclusive Deer Valley resort this weekend for what invitees are calling Republicanpalooza: a two-day retreat featuring Karl Rove, Condoleezza Rice, Jeb Bush and John McCain.
But the highlight for the 700 guests, who either contributed $50,000 or raised $250,000 for the campaign, will be unfettered access to Mr. Romney himself, who will deliver a speech and mingle at a cookout beside the ski jumps at Olympic Park.
Mr. Romney, who survived a prolonged and cash-draining Republican primary process, has accomplished what many once thought impossible: he is keeping pace with President Obama's vaunted fund-raising operation, which demolished records four years ago.
To a remarkable degree, interviews with donors, fund-raisers and staff members show, that financial haul has hinged on Mr. Romney's clout in the business world and his relentless personal cultivation of contributors, a political ritual for which Mr. Obama has shown little enthusiasm and Mr. McCain, the last Republican presidential nominee, displayed outright disdain. 
Mr. Romney has repeatedly invited top-flight donors to his home on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire for intimate gatherings where he serves cookies baked by his wife, Ann. He has spent hours meeting one-on-one with wealthy would-be backers from Cincinnati to Los Angeles who remain on the fence. And he has held seminars on issues that animate supporters, like Israel, education and energy.
The result: an infusion of high-dollar donations, which account for the vast majority of Mr. Romney's campaign contributions and helped him out-raise Mr. Obama last month, a symbolic and psychological milestone that set off alarms within the Democratic political world.
Mr. Romney, it turns out, is a thoroughbred fund-raiser. After spending years as a private equity executive talking the wealthy into parting with their money, he has had little trouble persuading contributors, especially entrepreneurs, to invest in his vision of a Romney White House that is pro-business and antitax.
''He has a tremendous aptitude for this,'' said Woody Johnson, owner of the New York Jets and one of Mr. Romney's earliest financial bakers.
The campaign's reliance, however, on wealthy donors and its refusal to disclose the identity of his bundlers, as the Obama campaign has done, has drawn criticism from advocates of campaign finance reform, and reinforced Mr. Romney's image as a candidate whose greatest appeal is with America's elite.
Not long ago, Mr. Romney visited the Park Avenue office of Kenneth G. Langone, a co-founder of the Home Depot who had called for Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey to run for president this year. After an hour, Mr. Romney had won over his fellow businessman.
''I didn't look or talk to him any differently than a guy coming in here pitching me on a start-up company,'' Mr. Langone said. ''They are exactly the same. I am investing in a person.''
Mr. Obama, of course, is an adroit fund-raiser, whose team pioneered -- and still dominates -- Web-based outreach to small donors. He has used the mechanisms of incumbency to his advantage, inviting donors to state dinners and appointing them to his Jobs Council. But the president's discomfort with stroking donors is well known, prompting some to complain that he can be chilly and inattentive.
Democrats express grudging admiration for Mr. Romney's fund-raising prowess. ''He has shown a great ability to listen to his donors and show he is engaged with them,'' said Robert Zimmerman, a Democratic National Committee member and an Obama fund-raiser. ''The fund -- raising strategy is about building relationships, not just about raising money.''
Now, as top-tier donors and bundlers like Mr. Langone reach their legal limits, Mr. Romney is pursuing a new breed of donors -- midlevel millionaires far from the corners of finance, who run dry cleaning chains and small industrial companies and share the candidate's small-government ideology.
The campaign recently held a conference call for 30 car dealership owners in which Mr. Romney's fund-raising chief emphasized the importance of family-owned businesses. The dealers have since become a reliable source of donations.
Sprawling campaigns have long struggled to keep up with the demands of their donors, many of whom feel entitled to instant responses to questions and requests for access.
The Romney campaign, by contrast, has flooded them with communications. There are daily and weekly conference calls, many featuring senior campaign members who offer updates on strategy and policy, and a software system that encourages friendly competition by allowing donors to monitor giving from friends whom they recruited. Several supporters recalled receiving all-hours phone calls and e-mails from Spencer Zwick, Mr. Romney's fund-raising chief, who has a 24-hour rule: all messages are returned within a day.
''I keep hearing from people who are shocked at the follow up and follow through,'' said Jack Oliver, who oversaw fund-raising for George W. Bush's presidential campaigns and is close to the Romney campaign.
It is the attention from Mr. Romney, however, that has left the deepest impression on donors, who said they felt like extended members of the family, much in the way Mr. Bush embraced contributors. Mr. Bush became famed for immersing donors in his Texas life during retreats in Austin and following up with handwritten thank yous.
''This is the Bush operation on steroids,'' said Anthony Scaramucci, a New York financier who has raised more than $1 million for Mr. Romney.
Mr. Scaramucci said he relished his time at Mr. Romney's house in New Hampshire, where the candidate gave a slide show about campaign strategy and spoke with guests on a deck overlooking the lake. ''People love being able to say they went to Romney's house,'' Mr. Scaramucci said. ''It's an attractive magnetron for the campaign.''
The campaign has organized much of its outreach around issues that energize contributors, like Israel. In May, it held a daylong series of policy discussions with donors at Mr. Romney's headquarters in Boston, ending with an appearance by the candidate himself.
Philip Rosen, a Romney donor active in Jewish causes, said the presence of the candidate ''shows he cares personally, which is something we know, but it's important to see. For those who did not have a personal relationship with him, it's essential.''
There is a harder edge to the operation, whose corporate-style punctiliousness and accountability is an extension of the candidate himself. Fund-raisers who repeatedly miss goals are quietly but firmly eased out of state chairmanships, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The campaign has been criticized for tying donations of $50,000 or more to guest packages for the Republican National Convention.
Mr. Johnson, the Jets owner, played down the issue.
''I don't have the feeling at all that any of this gets you any special access to anything untoward,'' he said.
Mr. Romney has bolstered outreach to smaller donors, online and through lotteries to have lunch with him and his wife. But such donors will not be invited to Utah this weekend, where Mr. Rove and Fred Barnes, executive editor of The Weekly Standard, will host a panel on the news media's role in presidential politics, and Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Meg Whitman, the chief executive of Hewlett-Packard, will discuss the government's impact on the economy.
Ray Washburne, a Romney fund-raiser attending the retreat, said the campaign had proved deft at ''making donors feel like they are inside players.''
''We feel very appreciated,'' he said.
