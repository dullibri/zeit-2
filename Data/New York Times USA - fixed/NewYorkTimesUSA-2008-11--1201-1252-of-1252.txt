HEADLINE: A Time for Faith

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Passing Faith On, Even If the Dogma Comes With It'' (Generations, by Eileen Greco, Nov. 23) was a timely reminder of the need for faith. I enjoyed her comments about the results-oriented tradition of Catholic prayers as well as the humorous excuses her father and grandmother had for not going to church.
 There are so many tragedies created by religious differences, so it is reassuring to hear about the power of faith. The attendance at a house of worship helps many people, but in the end I think the inner sense of gratitude and faith gives us spirituality. Thanksgiving is a particularly comforting holiday because it transcends religion and reminds us to be grateful. In these trying times, we need all the faith we can muster.

 Teardowns and Values
 To the Editor:

 Accepting Neighbors
 To the Editor:
 It is disturbing to read that the old negative stereotypes about neighbors with developmental disabilities still exist (''Accepting the Retarded, As Long as They're Old,'' Nov. 16).
 My son and his two roommates, all born with Down syndrome, live in a small house in Hartsdale. Yes, they do interact with their neighbors -- like the time they developed a petition and got all their neighbors to support building a sidewalk on their busy, dangerous street. Many people agreed to sign when my son reminded them that a sidewalk would make it much safer for their children on Halloween.
 And the time they asked me for help baking a cake. When I pointed out that they were all on diets, they responded: ''Oh the cake's not for us. It's to welcome the new neighbors who just moved in across the street!'' 
 I think I'd rather have these young men as my neighbors than the people you describe in your article whose lives are limited by prejudice and fear.

 To the Editor:
 To the residents of Claudet Way: Let me tell you about my 24-year-old son and the people he lives with: They are valued employees, active community volunteers and responsible citizens. Oh, and by the way, they have developmental disabilities.
 This simply means that their living needs are best met by varying levels of supervision. For example, they may need assistance with meal planning and cooking, budget and time management and sometimes physical accommodations. Like you and me, they lead quiet and purposeful lives. 
 To link mental retardation to a possibility of child molestation is sickening to those of us who know and love them. Mental retardation is not an indicator of sexual aberration or criminal intent. To the contrary, this population is characterized by gentle, innocent and nonthreatening individuals. These are also people who can be so easily be victimized financially and sexually by predators. 
 As a parent, I can tell you that a prime motivation of selecting a supervised living situation is to try to protect my child the best I can. I see these young adults currently living in Westchester as nothing but the nicest and quietest neighbors possible. Those residents of Eastchester protesting a group home are revealing prejudices that are at best uniformed, and at worst highly damaging to a group that could not possibly fight back.

 Nonprofit Priorities
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Charities Face Needs of Their Own,'' Nov. 23: While most nonprofits anticipate dismal fund-raising in this year's fourth quarter and beyond, according to the latest Giving USA, since 1969 total giving in the United States has grown every year in current dollars, even during recessions (albeit more slowly). So there is money to be raised. 
 The most important things nonprofits should do right now are: monitor their expenses and revenues weekly; assess donor bases to determine weak spots; attempt to distribute contributions over as large a number of donors as possible (should one large donor cease giving); emphasize good stewardship practices; get boards more involved in fund-raising than ever before; rethink or possibly reschedule special events; do all the groundwork for capital campaigns for when the economy improves; and try new strategies like joint fund-raising events with like-minded organizations.

HEADLINE: Bailing Away

 BODY:
The federal government is going for broke in an attempt to avert the type of calamitous financial collapse that led to the Great Depression. No one would fault the objective, but throwing money at the problem is becoming an end in itself. 
 Last week alone, while everyone was still arguing whether a $25 billion loan to the Big Three carmakers would be money down a sinkhole, the government committed more than $1 trillion to prop up Citigroup and to try to spur lending to consumers and home buyers. Moves to stabilize the system this year have put Americans in harm's way from possible losses on nearly $8 trillion pledged in loans, guarantees and investments to financial firms. And the crisis is far from over. 
 This page has consistently held that the government must intervene in markets when failure to do so would cause even greater economic harm. The impending collapse of Citi or an unrelenting credit freeze demand intervention. But good crisis management also requires that the calamity of the moment not be allowed to overwhelm good governing. Unfortunately, that is not the case now. 
 Even, as the rescue tab rises, taxpayers are not being adequately informed or protected. There is as yet no effort to deal effectively with the underlying causes of the problem, especially mass mortgage defaults that feed bank losses. And officials seem to think urgency to act absolves them from considering the longer-term implications of the actions they take. 
 In the Citi bailout, as in the bailout of American International Group and other financial interventions, the government has taken shares in the rescued firm in exchange for its investment. That is sensible, as far as it goes. But the upside for taxpayers has been overstated, because the risk in many of the investments may well outweigh the potential return. These gambles are the reason the government should attach more strings to its help, including a say in how the money is used and in major investments and management decisions. But the Treasury and the Federal Reserve have balked at taking greater charge, leaving taxpayers more exposed to losses than they probably realize. 
 Last week's plan from the Federal Reserve to jump-start mortgage lending also falls short. Even if it loosens credit, it will do little to stem foreclosures, because most of the defaults that are destabilizing the system do not result from the loans that the Fed has targeted. It is as if the Fed, fixated on the flames of a fire, is ignoring the fire's fuel source. 
 Another danger is that in fighting today's crises, the government is teeing up the next one. To finance the bailouts, the Treasury is borrowing money and the Fed is printing it. That bodes ill for a heavily indebted nation, presaging higher interest rates and higher prices -- perhaps sharply higher. That is not an argument for inaction. But frank acknowledgment of the dangers would put a premium on getting the rescues right today. As it is, the reckoning is postponed.
 Fed and Treasury officials are locked in full emergency mode, reacting and defending. And they probably have neither the inclination nor the time to improve their responses. By selecting Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman, to head a team to oversee the financial crisis, President-elect Barack Obama seems committed to a different way, one that combines the ability to respond quickly with the resolve to act wisely.

HEADLINE: That Digital Divide, Bridged in a Classroom

BYLINE: By TANYA MOHN

 BODY:
NEVER-ENDING bad news about layoffs and unemployment has been sobering for job seekers like Flora Schmidt of Mineola, N.Y. But Ms. Schmidt, who is 73, faces an additional hurdle in landing a part-time job: a lack of computer skills. ''If you want to do anything in the workplace, you must know computers,'' she said. 
 Kristin Fabos, executive director of SeniorNet, a nonprofit group, says that ''more and more seniors are needing to return to work and finding they may not have the computer skills they need.'' Her group has more than 130 volunteer-run computer learning centers in 33 states and offers more than 30 courses, in subjects ranging from computer basics and the Internet to word-processing programs and advanced classes like Excel for spreadsheets and PowerPoint. 
 ''Demand is great, as technology is growing so fast,'' said Slava Vero, co-coordinator of the SeniorNet center in Huntington, N.Y. She says the center has a waiting list. 
 Ms. Schmidt has completed several introductory and Internet courses at the Huntington center and is taking a class on Windows. She worked 30 years as a registered nurse and hopes her new computer skills will help land a nursing paralegal job. ''I'm determined,'' said Ms. Schmidt, who put two sons through college and says she needs a part-time job to make ends meet. 
 The percentage of older Americans who use computers is rising sharply but is still much lower than that of the general population. From March 2000 to August 2008, computer use among adults 65 and older almost doubled, to 38 percent, according to data from the Internet and American Life Project of the Pew Research Center. That compares with 74 percent of 50- to 64-year-olds and 86 percent of 30- to 49-year-olds.
 Susannah Fox, an associate director for the project, says that technologically savvy baby boomers are swelling the percentage of the 65-plus age group, but that factors like income and education remain significant barriers to accessibility. And for some older adults, the use of computers just wasn't relevant to their previous careers. 
 A number of organizations are working to close this digital divide. Most community colleges have technology programs geared to older job seekers. SeniorNet awards scholarships and recently established centers in underserved urban and Native American communities. Last year, it introduced online instruction. Some centers, like the Huntington SeniorNet center, plan to offer instruction to homebound older adults via Webcam and to donate recycled computers for students to use. 
 Last year, the AARP Foundation started WorkSearch, a program for low- to moderate-income older adults that provides skills assessment, training and related employment services. The program, offered free or at low cost, has 75 sites and has courses online. 
 Mary Kohl, 50, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, learned about WorkSearch when she filed for disaster unemployment benefits. She ran a day care business from her home, but when it was badly damaged from flooding this summer, she had to close it. She had some computer skills, but not enough to land a good job. 
 ''I wasn't proficient. Things have changed so much, I need to update my skills,'' said Ms. Kohl, who is taking a series of eight classes over four months -- including Windows XP basic and advanced topics like Quicken.
 Emily Allen, the foundation's assistant national director of work-force programs, says computer basics are essential even before landing a job. ''More and more companies require filing an application online,'' she said. Participants learn how to write a resume on the computer and do online job searches, she said. 
 Mimi Witcher, 65, of Carrollton, Tex., says she knows how a lack of computer skills can marginalize people. In the late 1990s, she had been a stay-at-home mom for more than 20 years when she had to go back to work. Her husband had lost his job and the couple had college bills for two daughters. ''I was 55 and completely computer-illiterate,'' she said. For a few years she worked at a local Barnes & Noble and did temp work. She began taking computer classes at Richland College nearby.
 Ms. Witcher did so well that about six months later she was asked to teach other older adults at the college. In addition to teaching at Richland, earlier this year she and her husband opened the Computer School for Seniors, www.cs4seniors.com, which offers more than 100 lesson plans online. 
 Molly Harrod, a research associate at the Institute of Gerontology at Wayne State University in Detroit, says feelings of insecurity over computers are common in older adults. Dr. Harrod conducted a yearlong study of a SeniorNet computer lab in the Midwest for her dissertation, ''No Senior Left Behind: Creating Older Adult Computer Users.''
 Students ''often made a point of letting me know how successful they were,'' she said. ''They'd say things like 'I have a Ph.D. from Harvard', or that they owned successful businesses, or they would talk about how successful their adult children are.'' Almost all of the students did it, Dr. Harrod added, as if they were saying ''I'm not dumb.'' 
 She also found that fear was pervasive -- fear, for example, of not being able to learn or of looking stupid. ''They felt they would be devalued or stigmatized,'' she said, ''that they would be left behind in society.'' 
 LEARNING computer skills is empowering, Ms. Witcher said. And even the tech-savvy can upgrade. 
 Dean Hofer, 72, of Richardson, Tex., used computers as an electrical engineer at Texas Instruments before he retired, but found the Photoshop classes he took with Ms. Witcher to be important tools in enhancing his business Web site. His hand- and custom-made wooden pens, sold online and at craft shows, are ''an important part of my income,'' Mr. Hofer said. 
 Ms. Witcher says that tackling the computer can be challenging for people who feel uncomfortable in a high-tech world. ''I know exactly how they feel,'' she said. ''Self-confidence is the biggest issue.''

HEADLINE: Forget State Vs. Treasury

BYLINE: By ROBERT HORMATS and DAVID M. KENNEDY. 
Robert Hormats, a managing director of Goldman Sachs, is the author of ''The Price of Liberty: Paying for America's Wars From the Revolution to the War on Terror.'' David M. Kennedy is a professor of history at Stanford and the author of ''Freedom From Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945.''

 BODY:
AMONG the parallels between our present financial turmoil and the Great Depression of the 1930s, few are more important to understand than the implications of economic upheaval for national security. One lesson from the Depression bears repeating loudly: Economic policy and foreign policy are not two distinct domains. They constitute a strategic nexus whose interconnections we ignore at our peril. 
 The perception that the United States was too enfeebled by its domestic travails to defend its interests emboldened Japan to invade Manchuria in 1931. The spectacle of Depression-era America continued to feed Japanese aggression, leading eventually to the brazen gamble that a single blow at Pearl Harbor might so demoralize the economically enervated Americans that they would throw in the towel and leave Asia to Japan. 
 In the 1930s, as now, in the face of severe economic affliction the temptation was strong to turn inward, to ''put our own house in order'' and tend to the international neighborhood later. That was Franklin Roosevelt's policy in 1933. ''Our international trade relations, though vastly important, are in point of time and necessity secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy,'' he said in his first inaugural address. 
 Accordingly, Roosevelt left unchallenged the Smoot-Hawley Tariff passed during the Hoover administration, and he added some nationalist measures of his own. Perhaps his worst decision was to scuttle London's World Economic Conference in 1933, convened to discuss international debt rescheduling, exchange-rate stabilization and the restoration of the gold standard. The conference afforded the last, desperate chance to deliver a concerted international counterpunch to the worldwide depression. Yet Roosevelt effectively withdrew the American delegation in July by declaring that the United States would have no further truck with the ''old fetishes of so-called international bankers.''
 Among those who drew malign conclusions was Hitler. Watching events from his Berlin chancellery, he calculated that the economic weakness of his adversaries opened vistas of opportunity for conquest. The inability of the democracies to cooperate economically portended their inability to cooperate militarily or diplomatically. And the ailing economy that was driving the United States inward removed America from Hitler's geopolitical calculus altogether. 
 On Nov. 5, 1937, having re-armed Germany in violation of its Versailles Treaty obligations, Hitler presented his senior political and military officials with an exhaustive blueprint for aggression. Over four hours, he analyzed in detail the probable reactions of other powers, including Britain, France, Russia, Italy, Japan, Belgium and Czechoslovakia. He did not even mention the United States, which he deemed incapable of offering serious resistance. By going AWOL in London in 1933, Roosevelt emboldened the man whose armed forces he would have to confront on the beaches of Normandy a decade later. 
 Depression and war were harsh teachers, but the lesson was learned. Surveying the economic chaos that had helped precipitate the war, Harry Dexter White, a Treasury Department official who was the principal architect of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, warned in 1942 that ''the absence of a high degree of economic collaboration among the leading nations will, during the coming decade, inevitably result in economic warfare that will be but the prelude and instigator of military warfare on an even vaster scale.'' 
 At war's end, American leaders started initiatives that replaced the discredited policies of economic nationalism with new rules and institutions to avert protectionism and exchange-rate turmoil, and to foster expanded international trade and investment. For more than two generations, the I.M.F., the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (later the World Trade Organization) did much to underwrite global political stability as well as America's and the world's prosperity. 
 To govern is to choose, but economic versus foreign policy is a false choice. The national security stakes are too high to allow aggressors or terrorists to conclude that America is too economically distracted to defend its interests. And global peace and prosperity, including economic growth in foreign markets and the flow of capital on which the United States is dependent, remain highly improbable without continued -- indeed, renewed -- American leadership, political as well as economic. 
 A crucial test of governing awaits the Obama administration. It must pursue economic recovery at home and around the globe and the reinvigoration of multilateral coordination abroad. Failure to revive the sagging domestic economy will make broader security and foreign policy goals more difficult to accomplish, as Americans seek refuge in economic nationalism and foreigners lose confidence in Washington's leadership. The political and economic cooperation needed to resolve the current crisis is as essential to America's domestic well-being as it is to the successful pursuit of our worldwide strategic interests. 
 The Depression and World War II were not two distinct events. Depression incubated war. The war, in turn, gave birth to the array of multilateral institutions that long served to avert another global economic crisis. Keeping that relationship in mind now can help this country to resist, and encourage others to resist, pressures for inward-looking trade and investment policies and withdrawal from international engagement. 
 It took a depression and a war to transform an older order. If we act swiftly and smartly, ours may be a happier fate. We have what may well be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to build an international economic architecture for a new century and in the process bolster our security. If we don't seize it, we may be doomed to repeat some pretty nasty history.

HEADLINE: Now in the Land of Resorts: Discounts

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH MAKER

 BODY:
UNTIL a few months ago, it wasn't uncommon for corporate executives to roll into the Tarrytown House Estate and Conference Center in Westchester County in a Mercedes or Ferrari and have meetings over free-flowing, top-shelf martinis, caviar and haute cuisine. Mixed in were dips in the pool, a tennis match or a bicycle spin in the fitness center, before guests retired to elegant rooms overlooking the Hudson River, for almost $1,000 per person, per night.
 But now, the Tarrytown House Estate, once a favorite meeting spot for the formerly behemoth, now defunct, Wall Street firms Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, is getting requests from corporations that still want to go there for business functions but need to scale things way back.
 ''What we're seeing is people can't do the bells and whistles anymore,'' said the Tarrytown general manager, Joe Santore. ''It's interesting to watch the psychology of the last 60 days. Instead of $20 martinis and open bars, our clients are asking for more value items, like beer and wine from New York State wineries and brewing companies, and simple, more affordable food.'' 
 So Tarrytown, the nation's oldest conference center, with mansions dating to the 1800s, has just created the Value Meeting Package for corporate meetings, starting at $299 a night. 
 Tarrytown is also offering a break for families and couples who want to get away for the weekend: For $159 a night, you get deluxe accommodations for two on the 26-acre Hudson Valley estate, with complimentary wine and a full breakfast.
 This is just one of many posh resorts, spas and conference centers around New York, Connecticut, New Jersey and Long Island that are offering special rates for leisure travelers and corporations, recognizing that some of their wealthy clients have taken a huge hit in the global economic crisis and unlimited budgets for luxury are dissipating -- at least for now.
 ''We're all in this together,'' said Janine Ziegler, sales and marketing director for the Inn at National Hall in Westport, Conn., a AAA Four-Diamond-Award hotel. ''In these stressful times, we need to take care of each other. We're offering lower rates, and we've put together some packages with local restaurants and stores, where you get great savings.'' 
 The Inn at National Hall has cut its rate for use of the executive board room to $500 from $750, and lowered its corporate room rate to $295 a night from $395. It is also offering a weekend Romance Package for two for $550, in a suite that would normally go for $695. The package includes Champagne and strawberries, dinner across the street at Napoli sul Fiume and breakfast the next morning.
 At the Ocean Place Resort and Spa in Long Branch, N.J., a place that prides itself on its Web site as offering ''shameless self-indulgence,'' the corporate rate just dropped to $199 a night from $350 and includes oceanfront accommodations, breakfast, lunch, dinner, two coffee breaks and audio-visual equipment. The rate for private guests was cut to $99 a night from $399, ''and we're throwing in a $20-off certificate to the spa for everyone,'' said Joseph Jenci, director of sales and marketing. ''This whole economic crisis has everyone in a tailspin -- everyone has to make some changes.''
 Mr. Jenci said many financial companies are looking for bargains in the wake of news that the American International Group, the insurance giant, went for a weeklong retreat at a luxury resort in California just after the federal government committed $85 billion to bail it out of financial ruin. ''I think a lot of companies have a perception issue right now after the A.I.G. thing,'' he said, ''not just with shareholders, but with taxpayers.'' 
 RATE cuts and incentives are also being offered at the Delamar Greenwich Harbor in Connecticut. Rated one of the best new hotels in the world by Conde Nast Traveler, ''we're still a popular destination, but we recognize that we need to do something to respond to the current economic climate,'' said Steve Weber, Delamar's director of sales. Room rates that used to run from $499 to $1,700 during the week are now starting at $289 on the weekends, Mr. Weber said.
 Other perks prompted by the economy at the Delamar include a wine-and-cheese reception, continental breakfast, complimentary tickets to the Bruce Museum across the street, and reimbursement for train travel from Grand Central Terminal, all included in the reduced room rates.
 On Long Island, at the Gurney's Inn, Resort, Spa and Conference Center in Montauk, ''we have just slashed all of our prices by at least 20 percent,'' said Ingrid Lemme, director of public relations and marketing. A new package, Escape for a Break, includes two nights in an ocean-view room, breakfast, lunch, dinner, a 60-minute massage, a 25-minute ''ocean radiance'' facial, a 50-minute body treatment, a 60-minute fitness class, a manicure, a guided beach walk and Gurney's signature makeup bag, for $695.
 Even the Ritz-Carlton in White Plains will lower its rates if you ask, said Vivian Deuschl, a spokeswoman. ''We're not putting our product on sale,'' she said. ''You don't see Gucci or Louis Vuitton having fire sales. But we can work with you, significantly, if you talk to us.'' A wedding, for example, that would normally cost more than $200 a person can be done for around $100 or less if you choose local wines and have chicken instead of salmon, she said. ''You don't have to give up luxury, you just have to be flexible.''
 The Ritz-Carlton is also giving all guests a $25 food and beverage credit, Ms. Deuschl said. 
 At Winvian in Morris, Conn., a whimsical fairytale of a resort and spa that opened last year, the owners have just introduced a weekday Escape to Winvian package that is still expensive but a big drop from its normal rate: $999 a night, compared with $1,450 to $1,950.
 Denise Morris Curt of Milford, Conn., was at Winvian recently with her friend Pamela Hoiles of Greenwich, who had won a two-night retreat for two at an auction. Ms. Hoiles stayed in the Treehouse, a two-story structure that swings slightly in the breeze, suspended between three trees, 35 feet above ground. Ms. Curt stayed in Beaver Lodge, a wood cottage with a stone double fireplace, a waterfall bathtub, pebbled floors and a reconstructed beaver dam in the center of the circular ceiling.
 ''It's like being in a primeval forest; it's the most restful sanctuary I have ever experienced,'' said Ms. Curt, wearing a mink hat and flip-flops, with cloth weaved between her toes to protect the polish that had just been applied at the spa. 
 She said the new $999 rate would enable her to return, maybe a few times a year. With a round-the-clock open bar, all meals prepared by a star chef, ''out of this orbit'' spa treatments, and ''service attendants who are there in an instant, in a Mercedes, to bring you whatever you need or take you wherever you want to go, you truly want for nothing here,'' she said. ''The way the world is right now, we need this more than ever. You come here a frazzled mess, and you leave serene, your batteries recharged, your spirit awakened.''

HEADLINE: A Dispatch From Housing's Front Lines

BYLINE: By PAULA GAIES. 
As told to Patricia R. Olsen. Preoccupations is a feature about working life. E-mail: preoccupations@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I'M an associate broker with Weichert Realtors, Northeast Group, in Albany. I'm divorced with three grown children, and I'm fully dependent on my income from my job. Luckily, the housing market in my area is not as bad as it is in other parts of the country. We never saw the meteoric highs in home prices as in other areas -- and if houses don't skyrocket, they won't fall as far. 
 Every Realtor I know is working a lot harder these days, though. Three or four years ago being a real estate agent was like going to the bakery. You walked in, took a number, and got what you wanted -- you could sell a house. Now you have to do a lot more prospecting and follow-up. 
 A lot of agents who joined during the good years don't want to work that hard and are leaving the industry. But having been a Realtor for more than 23 years, I've experienced the cycles. I know there are highs and lows and I have confidence that the housing market will come back. Still, this year I haven't made anywhere near what I made last year. I've been able to make ends meet, but that's about it.
 My biggest job right now is convincing both buyers and sellers that they're not making a mistake. They hear so much doom and gloom that they're almost paralyzed when it comes to making a decision.
 I spend a lot of time explaining to people that if they can qualify for a loan, it's a good time to buy a house. When the market was hot, houses were often sold in three hours. If someone didn't move on a house, it was gone. Today, there's time to think before buying. There's a lot less buyer remorse in this market. 
 I try to inspire confidence and make clients realize that it will be a good move financially. But people are scared to death to buy, especially when relatives like their Aunt Mary tell them they're crazy to buy in this economy. And sellers are nervous because they think they're going to lose a boatload of money. 
 We're in a catastrophic situation that was not created by normal market conditions. A few buyers were greedy and not too smart and got in over their heads, but it's also partly the bankers' fault. A year ago I would send couples to get a mortgage who had a 20 percent down payment. They had scrimped and saved, as their parents had advised them to do, and were proud that they had that much to put down. The bankers would tell them something like this: ''You have all this money, let's give you a 100 percent loan. Save that money and use it to buy furniture or go on vacation.'' 
 I was furious. I'd call the bankers and give them a piece of my mind. They'd say the buyers thought it was a good idea. What were two scared kids going to say to these smooth talkers? If housing prices fall even a bit, those buyers have no equity in their home, no cushion if they have to sell. They're in trouble unless they sell the house for more than they bought it. 
 My heart breaks for people who have lost money in selling their house. Last summer there was a house listed in my area for $417,000 that a couple had built eight months earlier for $447,000. Then the husband got transferred, and my buyers were able to purchase it for $391,000. 
 People have to remember that equity really exists only when a house is sold, like a stock. Unfortunately, if you have to sell at a bad time, you lose.
 Foreclosures are a nightmare to sell. Our agency has a standard sales contract, but every bank operates differently and seems to make up the rules as we go along. We're usually talking to an out-of-state home office, and even the local lawyers handling the transaction say they can't be that helpful. These houses are sold ''as is.'' 
 Recently I worked with a married couple who bought one, and they weren't even allowed to turn on the water to test the pipes. The bank had drained them already and didn't want to take the chance of a pipe bursting. But that meant my clients had to buy the house without knowing if there was a problem with the pipes.
 Our agency and our competitors all know we have to get through this time together. There are a couple of renegade agents out there who will price a house too high just to put a sign on the lawn. But it doesn't help any of us to take a buyer into a house that's grossly overpriced. After a while, buyers develop a sense of what's too high. 
 People think Realtors rake it in. The sales commission is split four ways, between two agencies and two agents, and there may be other fees as well. We don't get nearly as much as people think we do.
 I'm a perennial optimist. I'm not letting the fear about the market overtake me. If I throw up my hands and panic, it doesn't help me or my clients. 
 When the market picks up, I'll be running again. There were times when I was balancing five or six clients at once, and everyone wants to see houses at night or on the weekends. You work like crazy in the good times and drop with exhaustion. Right now I'm cleaning out a few closets, which I don't ordinarily get a chance to do.

HEADLINE: Local Pillars, Auto Dealerships Teeter Amid Big Three's Decline

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

DATELINE: QUINCY, Fla. 

 BODY:
Bruce Thomas washed cars at his father's General Motors dealership here at age 12, changed oil in high school, and sold his first Pontiac during college.
 His commitment to a famed American industry, part business and part romance, never waned. He took over his family's two dealerships, building a small fortune. In turn, he showered generosity on local churches, school athletic teams, charity golf tournaments and a group that helps women find jobs out of prison. 
 But suddenly, all of Mr. Thomas's success appears to be melting away.
 Days go by without a sale. His debts are mounting. His friends offer him cash to get by. ''I'm trying to survive as a car dealer,'' said Mr. Thomas, now 59, ''and I don't know if I can.'' 
 Top executives of the Big Three automakers are preparing to return to Washington this week with business plans they hope will lead to a federal bailout. But any government help will probably come too late for thousands of dealers like Mr. Thomas who sell American brands. 
 They have been struggling for years, as Detroit's fortunes waned, but what remains of their sales is evaporating along with consumer confidence and credit.
 The National Automobile Dealers Association predicts that roughly 900 of the nation's 20,770 new-car dealers will go out of business this year, and automobile analysts say the number of failed dealerships could rise into the thousands next year. 
 Even if Ford, Chrysler and G.M. survive, many believe a comeuppance is inevitable among dealerships; indeed, for years the nation has had more dealers for domestic brands than warranted by the sales volume of the Detroit automakers.
 The economic toll of a mass failure of dealerships around the country has already begun to harm the broader economy. In October alone, 20,000 employees of auto dealerships lost their jobs nationwide, more than half of those who were newly unemployed in the retail trade, according to the Labor Department. 
 The auto dealers association estimates that new-car dealers produce a $54 billion annual payroll for 1.1 million workers and nearly 20 percent of the retail sales and sales taxes in small and large communities alike.
 The auto dealers are not just businesses, of course. Most of them are deeply rooted in their communities, and each is a slice of Americana -- their big flags flying, their radio advertisements compelling attention and their Little League sponsorships and other charity helping to improve the lives of local people.
 In this small town outside Tallahassee, Mr. Thomas had 50 employees only two years ago when his two dealerships sold an average of 24 new vehicles a month. But now Mr. Thomas is lucky if he sells three new vehicles a week, and he has had to dismiss 10 of his remaining 40 employees in recent days.
 Salesmen at Mr. Thomas's two dealerships -- one selling Chrysler-Dodge-Jeep cars and the other General Motors models -- are so idle, they spend their time doing Sudoku puzzles, reading sports magazines and calling and writing old clients. They repeatedly implore the mail carrier to buy a car on mornings when he is the only one to come in the door. 
 Calmly resolute, Mr. Thomas spends his days talking to lawyers and bankers, trying to keep his business alive. Mr. Thomas has lost a lot of money in an investment in a cousin's Georgia dealership, but many of his problems appear to be not of his making.
 The last couple of years of rising gasoline prices took the steam out of the market for his Dodge Ram 2500 heavy pickup trucks and GMC Yukon sport utilities. In recent months, gasoline prices came down, but unemployment began rising here. The weak economy has hurt farmers, government workers and others. Quincy's middle class is hurting because of plummeting values for homes and stocks.
 And now the credit market -- the lifeblood of any car dealership -- is frozen. Finance companies have tightened credit both for car buyers and for dealerships like Mr. Thomas's that stock their showrooms with vehicles bought on credit. The car companies are delaying some payments to dealers because of their own problems.
 Mr. Thomas has gotten behind in payments to GMAC, G.M.'s financing arm, so the company sent a representative to his dealerships two weeks ago to take control of the keys of new cars on his lots to guarantee that GMAC is paid when any vehicles are sold. 
 Mr. Thomas has stopped ordering new vehicles, and he is relentlessly cutting costs, including his own salary. He is slashing medical benefits and matching funds for the retirement accounts of his remaining employees. He has stopped giving free oil changes and tires to charities, stopped offering coffee to customers and even canceled janitorial services for the bathrooms.
 Gathering workers for a pep talk in the service garage of his G.M. dealership the other day, Mr. Thomas said, ''We are going to fight hard to keep everything going we can, but there are things that could go out of control.'' As the employees fidgeted, he added, ''Let's try our best to sell a car today.'' 
 Salesmen are passing out their resumes to visitors, and they say they are not sure they will get paid from one week to the next. 
 ''You have to laugh to keep from crying these days,'' Lynn Mayo, the office manager at the G.M. dealership, said as she wiped away tears. ''The whole mess is hard.''
 The downturn has been years in the making. Mr. Thomas's total sales, including repairs and used cars, fell to $26 million in 2007 from $32 million in 2005. This year he hopes sales will reach $20 million based largely on stronger business during the first half. During the last two months, sales and repairs hit a wall.
 It is a big comedown for a business that began with Mr. Thomas's father, Howard, who came to Quincy after World War II to start a used-car business across the street from a Chevrolet dealer. Howard Thomas was so successful, the Chevrolet dealer bought him out and brought him into the new-car business as a manager. 
 In 1967 Howard Thomas bought half of the local Pontiac-GMC store, and 12 years later it became a Thomas family operation run by him and his son. The business expanded to two dealerships and became a major benefactor to the local Little League team, theater and other charities. More than 400 people attended Howard Thomas's funeral in February. The business has long been the biggest retail employer in the town after Wal-Mart, and has produced $1 million in sales taxes annually in recent years.
 Local officials say they know Mr. Thomas is in trouble, and they fear the consequences of his going out of business. ''It would be a huge tragedy for us,'' said Quincy's mayor, Andy Gay, whose first job after getting married was selling cars at a Thomas dealership. 
 Mr. Thomas's business is a microcosm for the whole industry. At least 70 percent of the dealerships that have closed so far this year sell American cars, and better than 60 percent of the remaining dealerships sell the troubled Detroit brands. ''A lot of them will go out of business,'' predicted Rex Henderson, an auto analyst at Raymond James & Associates.
 ''We have never seen anything like this,'' said Denny Fitzpatrick, owner of a Chevrolet-Hummer dealership outside Oakland and chairman of the California New Car Dealers Association. Having already dismissed 56 of his 114 employees, Mr. Fitzpatrick added, ''You lay awake at night trying to figure out how to keep these doors open.''
 Car dealers are not entirely blameless for their fate. Auto analysts say they did not push Detroit hard enough to build better-quality, more efficient cars. They note that the dealers lobbied hard in state capitals for laws to protect their franchises from the Detroit manufacturers who wanted to limit their numbers and determine their locations. 
 Mr. Thomas lays some blame on the unions that drove hard bargains with the automakers, some on a news media that ''glorified'' imports, and some on the Big Three for being ''slow to react to the market and what the public wanted,'' especially when gas prices rose in recent years.
 To compensate, Mr. Thomas said he had changed his inventory the last couple of years to include fewer trucks and sport utilities, adding more fuel-efficient vehicles like the Pontiac G6. He shifted his advertising away from newspapers to the Internet. He gradually reduced his business' charitable giving, once $30,000 a year, to $1,900 this year.
 He has begun a radio campaign offering zero percent financing on all his 2008 Chrysler, Dodge and Jeep vehicles for 36 months, and savings of up to $12,000 on Yukon XLs.
 But sales have not budged.
 Speaking in an office decorated with antique golf clubs, autographed baseballs and a photograph of his grandfather posing beside a 1952 Buick Roadmaster, Mr. Thomas said he had no major regrets.
 ''As a kid I dreamed about cars,'' he said. ''The business has changed and the cars have changed, and it's been fun to be part of that.'' 
 But he said he saw more trouble ahead. 
 ''At this point, I see no light at the end of the tunnel,'' he said, closing his eyes for a moment to think. ''I only see it getting worse. Any bailout to Detroit will take a while to get to Main Street.''

HEADLINE: The Housing-Bubble Revolution

BYLINE: By TIM ARANGO. 
author tag with dummy text.

 BODY:
When Benjamin Franklin returned to America in 1762, after almost five years in London, he was shocked at the housing prices.
 ''The expence of living is greatly advanc'd in my absence,'' he commented. ''Rent of old houses, and value of lands ... are trebled in the past six years.''
 Franklin, it seems, had come home to a real estate bubble. It eventually popped -- bringing on a credit crunch and deep recession that was the macroeconomic backdrop to the American Revolution.
 Sound familiar? 
 The parallels between the current economy and the one Franklin saw highlight a debate among historians: how big a role did economics, as opposed to ideas, play in fomenting revolution?
 ''I think there's reason to doubt the Revolution would have happened as it did if it weren't for these economic conditions,'' said Ronald W. Michener, an economics professor at the University of Virginia, in a radical departure from today's popular notion that the Revolution was a product primarily of grand ideas about self-government. 
 Gordon S. Wood, a professor at Brown University and perhaps the pre-eminent living historian on the subject, counters: ''There was a great deal of instability, but that is hardly an explanation for the Revolution. I don't think you can make a strong argument for an economic interpretation of the Revolution.''
 Professor Michener and his collaborator, Robert W. Wright, a financial historian at New York University, plan to do just that. The tandem worked for several years on a manuscript arguing that the American Revolution was a direct result of the economic malaise that followed the French and Indian War. 
 Now they have a built-in marketing hook -- the current financial crisis -- and the publisher, Yale University Press, is hoping to bring the book out as early as next fall. ''What I found was that the monetary difficulties faced by the colonies were not very different from modern macroeconomic problems,'' Mr. Michener said.
 For the colonists, as for us, first came the boom. During the height of the French and Indian War, which lasted from 1754 until 1763, money flooded into the colonies, especially New York, where the British Army was headquartered. At the same time, the New York Legislature issued large numbers of bills of credit.
 All that cash sloshing around resulted in lavish displays of wealth -- notably by British officers, whose opulent living was emulated by the locals, especially in New York. 
 Housing prices soared during the war. But when credit tightened afterward -- thanks in no small part to a prohibition on the issuance of paper money by the colonies under the Currency Act of 1764 -- real estate owners who could not pay their debts lost their land. 
 John Morton, a sheriff of Chester County in Pennsylvania who would sign the Declaration of Independence, seized 180 farms between 1766 and 1769. 
 At the core of the Wright-Michener argument is that this confluence of nasty economic circumstances was what produced the anger that found expression in rebellion against the Stamp Act and other British taxes. In other words, the core economic culprit was a boom-bust cycle; convinced that their future was no longer in their hands, the colonists could summon the ghost of John Locke, setting the stage for the arguments of Tom Paine and the Declaration.
 Professor Wood argues, in response, that while an individual's response to the revolutionary cause was partly related to his economic circumstances, democratic ideas had been percolating for years and came to the fore only after specific actions by the British -- for example, the Stamp Act, which is widely considered to have triggered the rebellion. And it wasn't just immediate economic conditions that were ripe: the colonial population was growing faster than the population in Britain, and Franklin foresaw a day when America would be the center of the British Empire. In addition, because property was more easily acquired in the colonies than in Britain, America had a much larger proportion of common citizens, as opposed to nobles, among those entitled to vote. 
 Of course, economists acknowledge that ideas play a role in history, just as historians of ideas know the narrative has an economic backdrop. These two professors are trying to take back a larger part of the revolutionary story for large-scale economic events in a time when most recent histories have focused on the ideas. ''We're not trying to replace the ideological view,'' Professor Wright said. ''We're saying we have an important piece of the puzzle.''
 Fashions in history-telling often swing on a pendulum. In 1913, Charles A. Beard wrote his seminal book, ''An Economic Interpretation of the Constitution,'' which presented the founders' economic self-interest as the principal factor in their commitment to revolution. About a half-century later, Bernard Bailyn, of Harvard, wrote ''Ideological Origins of the American Revolution,'' setting a benchmark for those who consider ideas to have been the main impulse. Along the way, other histories emphasized the exploits of common people, rather than the titans of history.
 But matters macroeconomic -- as opposed to mere British tax policies -- have not been a dominant part of the narrative in recent years. ''You walk into Barnes & Noble and there's all these great big books on Franklin, Jefferson,'' said Edward Countryman, a professor of American history at Southern Methodist University and author of ''The American Revolution,'' which traces the rebellion to a number of transformative developments, rather than one overriding cause. ''By and large these authors are discounting any attempt to take into account social experience.'' 
 Of course, even many historians who focus on the founders' philosophies -- including Professor Wood -- say economics and social forces played a role. (Professor Countryman tells his students that trying to pin down Professor Wood is like trying to grab ''a trout that is covered in olive oil'' because he includes elements of both Beard and Bailyn in his books, even if his overarching view tilts toward ideas.) 
 ''The reigning interpretation right now is ideological,'' Professor Wood said. ''I think the overall picture is pretty clear right now. But there will always be new generations of historians coming along.''
 And a continuing argument, no doubt. 
 As Professors Wright and Michener see things, had British monetary policy been different, and had the recession been short, the United States might have gained independence only gradually, much as Canada did -- over the course of more than a century, beginning in the 1860s. 
 That is a fun game of ''what if,'' but for those historians more attuned to ideas, the economic forces at play will always be subservient to the words of Jefferson and Madison.
 ''We are having a very serious crisis right now,'' Professor Wood said, ''but no one is talking about revolution.''

HEADLINE: England's Culinary Wild West

BYLINE: By HENRY SHUKMAN

 BODY:
THOREAU observed that humans are happily designed in such a way that the distance they can cover in a day's walking means that were they to spend every day hiking in a different direction from their homestead, it would take a lifetime to get to know every corner of their surroundings. 
 There's something analogous in the distance that meat and vegetables can cover in an ox cart -- in the old formula of market towns gathering and redistributing the produce of a region. It's like concocting a meal with what you have in the kitchen, rather than shopping to suit a previously planned meal. These often turn out the most satisfying dinners, settling a craving in us not for parsimony but for good economy. 
 There's a rightness about working with what we have, rather than giving in to the screaming pasha within who's never satisfied, always craves more, and doesn't care how far it has to travel to get to him. If there's anything spiritual to be found in the kitchen, it surely has to do with settling this inner tyrant. 
 Any region can use a patron saint, and in England's West Country, that saint is Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall (a k a Hugh Fearlessly Eats-It-All). One of Britain's top TV chefs, Mr. Fearnley-Whittingstall is on a near-holy mission to return to the land. He had his first success with a show called ''A Cook on the Wild Side,'' in which he traveled around cooking up game and wild plants on his camping stove. 
 Then he settled in Dorset and moved into growing his own food -- saddleback pigs, old breeds of chicken -- and reviving many old techniques for curing and preserving the food. His larder is permanently hung with sausages, salamis, hams and varieties of smoked fish.
 What he advocates goes far beyond organic. His philosophy is ''plow to plate'': ideally, the consumer is the grower, or failing that, the grower's neighbor. He calls it ''food integrity.''
 At his new restaurant, the River Cottage Canteen, in the market town of Axminster, even the wine is as local as possible, all of it from England except for a few French organic and biodynamic labels. Almost nothing solid comes from farther afield than the West Country. There's no bottled water -- an abomination of wastefulness.
 A truly organic restaurant today needs a field of local suppliers. What good is an organic carrot or blueberry with a giant carbon footprint? Just as farmers' markets are spreading in both Britain and America, so too is local-mindedness in restaurants. It's not just about carbon, but a deeper connectedness between people and land. 
 It's a connectedness I fantasized about as a child: When I was 10, my favorite book was ''Survival for Young People.'' It told you about bivouac bags and collecting rainwater with a plastic sheet. But what electrified me were the pages on eating wild -- the leaves and roots you could get by on, how to trap a rabbit, how you should always have a fishing line in your pack. 
 Go into the woods with Pages 54 to 83 cracked open, and you could hide out forever. Be nothing but a forager, with no purpose on this earth other than to find the sustenance to keep going. That was true freedom. 
 If this all sounds somewhat medieval, it is. The kind of self-reliance a household would have known before the advent of processed and packaged foods, when good husbandry included knowledge of how to process food oneself, is precisely what Mr. Fearnley-Whittingstall is trying to revive. 
 The Canteen's decor reflects this. I find myself eating at a table of reclaimed wood in a wood-rich, loftlike space. 
 The first thing I try is crispy pig's head. (I've never been observant but this is ridiculous.) The plate consists of a fried slice of something like a pate -- in fact a version of headcheese, or brawn -- with applesauce and Le Puy lentils. Not only do the sweet apple and rich brawn go together well, but there's an automatic burst of self-congratulation in even daring to take a mouthful. 
 There's an austerity about the place, but the food is stunning: sea bass in a lemon and herb sauce, with braised fennel and sauteed Highland Burgundy potatoes, ruddy and smothered in oil; and two kinds of lamb on one plate, slices of dense, melting, pink roast tenderloin and dark glistening shreds of braised shoulder. With sauteed potatoes cooked in cream, both are glorious.
 My friend Dave Swann and I end with rhubarb jelly -- a wobbly mound of luminous red jelly, a dab of whipped cream on a shortbread biscuit, and a heap of cooked rhubarb. Another British standard, rhubarb is a favorite of public and backyard vegetable patches. 
 Our other dessert is yogurt-based pink gooseberry ice cream, and when the waitress presses liqueurs of the Somerset Cider Brandy Company on us, we accept: Kingston Black Apple Aperitif makes for a rich after-dinner sip, in spite of its name. 
 According to his publicists, Mr. Fearnley-Whittingstall doesn't exactly think of himself as a great chef. His mission is changing peoples' relationship to food production. Even a window box of herbs in central London is better than nothing, he contends: food-blindness is part of our postindustrial alienation; we're alienated from our very plates.
 At the River Cottage HQ, a 65-acre farm on the border with Dorset where Mr. Fearnley-Whittingstall's TV shows are filmed, all the tools to teach people how to become more involved in supplying their own larders have been set up. There are grazing pigs and chickens; clay ovens in different stages of construction; smokers made of old barrels and gas canisters; and hams, salamis and sausages hanging from rafters. 
 The clay ovens bake bread in five minutes, cook scallops on the shell in seconds, pizza in a minute. And as the heat dissipates over 24 hours, you can slow-cook whole shoulders of lamb, ending up with meat so tender you spoon it off the bone.
 In a converted 16th-century barn with a gleaming professional kitchen, participants in Mr. Fearnley-Whittingstall's workshops are given a local banquet at the end of their day's education. Green Champagne bottles hang from the rafters, converted into lamps. Sixty guests can be seated at two long baronial tables. There's a Saxon feel to the whole venture. 
 When I visited, at the end of one table stood a black casserole of beef shin from local Devon ruby red cattle, with big orange-hued rings of marrowbone, the meat melting off them. Part of the mission is to rehabilitate undervalued cuts, like shins, and the so-called fifth quarter of a carcass (the offal). 
 Mr. Fearnley-Whittingstall hasn't gone so far as to use blood as a flooring ingredient, but almost nothing goes to waste. In the kitchen, sheep's intestines are soaking in cold water for making sausage, and the fridge is a Chaucerian chamber of innards.
 Local food has become a focus throughout the rural West Country, with its many small farms. At the Masons Arms in the seaside village of Branscombe on the South Devon coast, the soft and tasty Branoc Ale is brewed a quarter of a mile from the village at the Branscombe Vale Brewery. The spit in the fireplace -- gently turned by customers seated with pints at the open fire -- was forged at the blacksmith's half a mile the other way. 
 They even smoke the fish in the fireplace, hanging from the saw-teeth from which the spit is suspended. The fireback is a tarry glistening black -- not from the fire but from the fat of all the meat that has cooked there.
 The stonewalled bar has been there since 1350, when masons from the local quarry would stop in to ease their dusty throats. The bar top still has a brass slot where thirsty horsemen would (allegedly) ride right up to the counter and drop in a penny to have a pint of cider pulled.
 At a small pub table, a plain white bowl of pea and ham soup is a soft green, like the turf above the cliffs. Slender sweet juliennes of pepper are just right against the smooth texture of the soup. The fresh beer-battered haddock caught off the coast is succulent and chunky, and the leek, salmon, mussel and haddock stew, in its own pot with a lid of Cheddar-smothered mashed potatoes, is as heartwarming as seafood can be. 
 Upstairs, above the original horsehair ceilings, which sag like an old mattress between black, octagonal ships' beams, there are 21 bedrooms with deeply uneven floors, where you can sleep off your time at the bar.
 THE other end of the West Country, southwest Gloucestershire, has its local food movement, too. Stroud has a history of independent-mindedness, being one of the first English towns to set up its own currency. It was also one of the first to have an active farmers' market (the 2008 National Farmers' Retail and Markets Association's Market of the Year), which spills out from Cornhill Market, a stone-columned square in the middle of town. 
 Just down the hill, theStar Anise Art Cafe specializes in vegetarian food with a local emphasis. It's a good place to hang out, and like so many buildings in this corner of the West Country, it's built of the lovely Cotswold stone, a soft yellow that blends into the rolling hills.
 In nearby Nailsworth, the chef at Wild Garlic, Matthew Beardshall, will pull his car over on the way to work, and stroll into the woods to pick the restaurant's eponymous herb. It grows in abundance in the Cotswold hills. 
 ''It likes shade,'' he says. ''The sun brings out the smell, so it's easy to find.'' He likes to stuff the long dark-green leaves under the skin of chicken.
 But it's only one of many items the surrounding woods and farms supply. He'll plan the week's meals according to what the farmers tell him they have. 
 ''If I hear, say, the purple sprouting's good but there's only one more week of it, then I go with that,'' he says. ''It's insane to import organic stuff from Chile.'' 
 He buys some of his meat from Prince Charles's nearby Duchy of Cornwall farms. (The prince is well known as a champion of local organic food.) 
 ''I'll buy a whole piece of meat, not cuts,'' Mr. Beardshall says. ''Then I can render down the fat for roasting potatoes, and use the trimmings for sauce. Or the butcher goes out shooting, and comes back with pigeon and rabbit. We'll take what he bags. Unprepped pigeons don't look pretty, but they taste great.''
 In his restaurant, which has spare wood floors and stone walls, the local poet Jay Ramsay and I start with ramekins of smooth chicken liver parfait covered with a lid of pure butter -- a traditional English method of sealing. The livers are from local organic chickens, mixed with rendered pork fat. With a shot glass of fig and honey compote on the side, and slices of thick white toast, the smooth pate is superb. 
 As are his thick pappardelle with tender slow-braised rabbit in sage, and chicken with bok choy, potatoes and wild garlic leaves. Between courses, Mr. Beardshall serves a little granita of caramelized apple and thyme. 
 Over all, an evening at Wild Garlic is a perfect marriage of the modern and the medieval. It's as if the industrial era has been neatly leapfrogged. And you can stay the night, too, in the spacious 16-century rooms of the Heavens Above guesthouse upstairs.

HEADLINE: A Shopping Guernica Captures the Moment

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
From the Great Depression, we remember the bread lines. From the oil shocks of the 1970s, we recall lines of cars snaking from gas stations. And from our current moment, we may come to remember scenes like the one at a Long Island Wal-Mart in the dawn after Thanksgiving, when 2,000 frantic shoppers trampled to death an employee who stood between them and the bargains within.
 It was a tragedy, yet it did not feel like an accident. All those people were there, lined up in the cold and darkness, because of sophisticated marketing forces that have produced this day now called Black Friday. They were engaging in early-morning shopping as contact sport. American business has long excelled at creating a sense of shortage amid abundance, an anxiety that one must act now or miss out. 
 This year, that anxiety comes with special intensity for everyone involved -- for shoppers, fully cognizant of the immense strains on the economy, which has made bargains more crucial than ever; for the stores, now grappling with what could be among the weakest holiday seasons on record; and for policy makers around the planet, grappling with how to substitute for the suddenly beleaguered American consumer, whose proclivities for new gadgets and clothing has long been the engine of economic growth from Guangzhou to Guatemala City.
 For decades, Americans have been effectively programmed to shop. China, Japan and other foreign powers have provided the wherewithal to purchase their goods by buying staggering quantities of American debt. Financial institutions have scattered credit card offers as if they were takeout menus and turned our houses into A.T.M.'s. Hollywood and Madison Avenue have excelled at persuading us that the holiday season is a time to spend lavishly or risk being found insufficiently appreciative of our loved ones. 
 After 9/11, President Bush dispatched Americans to the malls as a patriotic act. When the economy faltered early this year, the government gave out tax rebate checks and told people to spend. In a sense, those Chinese-made flat-screen televisions sitting inside Wal-Mart have become American comfort food.
 And yet the ability to spend is constricting rapidly. Credit card limits are getting cut. Millions of Americans now owe the bank more than the value of their homes, making further borrowing impossible. The banks themselves are hunkered down, just hoping to survive. 
 Live within our means and save: This new commandment has entered the conversation, colliding with the deeply embedded imperative to spend. And yet much of the distress is less the product of extravagance than the result of the fact that in many households the means are nowhere near enough for traditional middle-class lives. 
 Wages for most Americans have fallen in real terms over the last eight years. Pensions have been turned into 401(k) plans that have just relinquished half their value to an angry market. Health benefits have been downgraded or eliminated altogether. Working hours are being slashed, and full-time workers are having to settle for jobs through temp agencies. 
 Indeed, this was the situation for the unfortunate man who found himself working at the Valley Stream Wal-Mart at 5 a.m. Friday, a temp at a company emblematic of low wages and weak benefits, earning his dollars by trying to police an unruly crowd worried about missing out.
 In a sense, the American economy has become a kind of pinata -- lots of treats in there, but no guarantee that you will get any, making people prone to frenzy and sending some home bruised. 
 It seemed fitting then, in a tragic way, that the holiday season began with violence fueled by desperation; with a mob making a frantic reach for things they wanted badly, knowing they might go home empty-handed.

HEADLINE: Filling a Gap in Child Care, a Few Families at a Time

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP. 
E-mail: parenting@nytimes.com

 BODY:
SHIRLEY, N.Y.
JENNIFER MABANTA, 36, a divorced mother of two, rises at 4:45 each morning, gets herself ready for nursing school, then wakes her children, Anthony, 10, and Veronica, a year old. She breastfeeds the baby; tries, usually without luck, to get some breakfast into Anthony; checks to make sure he has his backpack; and then bundles both of them up against the cold. By 6:20, they're out the door, heading for Miss Patty's.
Their schedule is tight. At 6:30, the little family is standing in the 29-degree predawn darkness, their steamy breath visible, ringing the front doorbell at the home of Patricia Christofferson, Miss Patty. It is an ordinary four-bedroom house on a quiet middle-class street here, but for Ms. Mabanta it is the Super Glue in her life.
''Come in,'' Mrs. Christofferson says, pulling them into the warmth. 
''How's my good girl?'' she says, taking Veronica from her mother. ''How's my angel baby?''
''Actually,'' Ms. Mabanta says, ''she threw up last night. I didn't get to study for my cardio test. If she starts to look not good today, give me a call.''
''We'll be fine,'' Miss Patty says. ''Won't we, angel baby?''
''Give me a kiss, I love you,'' the mother says. ''Have a great day. Bye, guys. I love you, bye.'' And in under a minute, she is back in her car, heading to Northport.
The bell rings twice more this morning. At 7:20, Charice Triche, another single mom, arrives with Destiny, 7, and Ka-deah, 5, says hello to Miss Patty, goodbye to her daughters (''Give me a kiss. ... I love you, but I got to get down the road'') and is off to her customer service job in Hauppauge. At 9:05, Jennifer Oster, a third single mother, drops off Christian, 2, and heads for her job at Stop & Shop in Riverhead.
Each of the three mothers has been on welfare and is either off now or soon will be (early next year, Ms. Mabanta graduates from an intensive, 13-month, seven-hour-a-day nursing course).
They could not have done it, they say, without the free, government-subsidized, state-licensed and highly dependable day care provided at Mrs. Christofferson's house and thousands of homes like it around the state.
''Important? Oh my God, it's so important,'' Ms. Mabanta says. ''I would never be able to get my nursing degree without this. I could get a job, but I'd just be working to pay off day care. I'd be stuck on public assistance.''
In these very hard times, the question is: Will such programs aimed at helping poor parents pull themselves out of poverty survive? Or will they be cut as state governments retrench?
Already there are problem signs. Over the last three years, the federal government has reduced its day care contribution to the state from $314 million to $300 million, according to William T. Gettman Jr., deputy commissioner of the State Office of Children and Family Services. In its most recent budget the state cut its share 2 percent to $137 million. In response, Suffolk County imposed a child care freeze in June, meaning no new children would be accepted just as the need was growing. In the four months before that freeze, the number of children receiving day care assistance grew 10 percent, according to Roland Hampson, a Suffolk welfare office spokesman.
With Gov. David A. Paterson predicting billions more in budget cuts soon, providers are worried. ''To save money on day care, we may be about to spend a lot more on welfare,'' says Robert Cianchetti, the day care director for Little Flower Children and Family Services of New York, a nonprofit agency that oversees providers like Mrs. Christofferson.
In the mid-1990s, President Bill Clinton and the Republican-controlled Congress passed workfare legislation intended to get people off welfare and into jobs by providing training and day care.
Over the next decade, thanks to the growth of these programs and a strong economy, the number of welfare recipients decreased dramatically, to 4.4 million from 12.2 million. New York hit a high point of 259,000 children up to age 12 receiving subsidized day care in 2004, and last year had 213,000. In Suffolk, the average cost to subsidize a child is $180 a week, not all of which goes to the caregiver. For Mrs. Christofferson, 47, who has been doing this eight years and is considered one of Little Flower's best, that translates into an income of about $30,000 a year, for 10- to 12-hour days.
She had worked as a mail carrier, but switched to day care to be home with her own three children, who are now all teenagers. Her husband, Stephen, is an elevator repairman for Local 3 of the electricians' union.
Although she runs the program out of a playroom in the back of the house, there is lots of government paperwork: daily menus; daily health reports; time sheets for each child. Cabinets must have locks. Pools, even wading pools, are prohibited; Slip'n Slides are O.K. Every two years there are courses in CPR, nutrition, the warning signs of child abuse. Every month there are inspections.
''Where's my toast?'' Destiny yells.
''Coming, it's coming,'' Miss Patty says.
She gets the baby bundled up again, checks that everyone has gone potty and is out the door at 7:45 for the school bus. After the big kids are gone, she takes Veronica's hand and they walk to the end of her driveway to pick up Newsday. ''Paper,'' says Veronica.
''What a smart girl,'' Miss Patty says.
At nap time, Christian will not sleep unless she rocks him.
After school, she has a half dozen children at once, including Angelise, 6, who has autism. It was Mrs. Christofferson who suspected autism. ''She'd rock back and forth, wouldn't talk, just screamed all the time,'' Mrs. Christofferson said. ''It got so bad, my kids wanted to get rid of her.''
Mrs. Christofferson went online, figured it out and urged Angelise's grandmothers, who have custody, to get the girl tested. The special education Angelise has received has made a major difference -- she's now verbal, beginning to spell and is well behaved.
At one point, in the afternoon, chaos breaks out. ''Christian, I need you to stop throwing things,'' Miss Patty says. ''Ka-deah, put the cushion back on the couch.''
''I want an apple,'' shouts Ka-deah.
''I just gave you an apple,'' Miss Patty says.
''I don't want it cut up,'' says Ka-deah.
But Miss Patty does not blow, and as fast as things flare up, they turn quiet. Soon everyone's eating saltines and doing homework. Ms. Mabanta comes at 3:30 for Anthony and Veronica. She says she had a good day, arrived at school early enough to study for her quiz and got a 98.
Ms. Oster is back from Stop & Shop for Christian. At 4:05, one of Angelise's grandmothers, Linda Rittereiser, a school bus driver, arrives.
''I'm drinking hot chocolate,'' Angelise tells her.
''I can see,'' Ms. Rittereiser says.
The Triche sisters are last, getting picked up at 4:30. Mrs. Christofferson has their coats, scarves and gloves on when they remember they have to go potty. Five minutes pass, 10, 15 and there's no mother. The sun has set, the man on the radio says the wind chill makes it feel like 13 degrees. Mrs. Christofferson is supposed to pick up one of her own daughters from the high school.
She digs out the emergency contact card and calls three numbers, but gets voice mail messages. An hour late, the mother arrives, apologizing. She says something about problems at home. She thanks Miss Patty, says she's appreciative, and though she doesn't say why, it's understood: Her daughters are safe, warm and cared for.

HEADLINE: No Job and Fewer Gifts

BYLINE: By JAN HOFFMAN

 BODY:
SUSAN McCABE liked to go all out for Christmas. Presents for friends and 17 relatives: high-end cameras for adults, Nintendo Wii for the children. On Christmas Eve, she proudly treated the immediate family to dinner at romantic white tablecloth restaurants in Manhattan. Sticker shock? Ms. McCabe, who sold eco-friendly technology, wouldn't blink twice.
 But in September, the start-up company she worked for went belly up.
 A restaurant dinner? All those presents? 
 ''Out of the question,'' said Ms. McCabe, who is scrambling to make the rent on her Manhattan apartment. ''And that really bothers me.''
 In solidarity, Ms. McCabe's sister, Robin, a lawyer, suggested a familywide ban on gifts for the adults. Then, to strike a tone more seemly for the times and her little sister's circumstances, Robin reshaped her annual Brooklyn Heights holiday party: the sparkly, dressy affair will be a potluck gathering with a charitable component. It will feature clothing from Goods of Conscience, a new line sewn by Bronx seamstresses using fabric woven by Guatemalan women, who share in the profit.
 Many people have a narrative about their holiday rituals: the worship, the setting, the food, the gifts, the personae, the drama. But this year, the economy is rudely tearing apart those yellowed scripts. 
 For millions, this is the first time they are compelled to scale back and reframe their holiday traditions.
 Many must do so out of unaccustomed need and shame, some out of prudent apprehension. Others, like Robin McCabe, are retooling their annual blowouts in deference to those harder hit. The negotiations can be painful. At what cost preserving holiday magic for the children? The conversations are awkward not only for those who have lost their jobs but also for friends and relatives as they trip on that fine line between sensitive and patronizing. 
 But Hanukkah, Christmas, Kwanzaa and New Year's all honor light in a dark season. Perhaps that is why people around the country, in describing how they are adjusting celebrations this year, speak of finding the upbeat in the downbeat -- at least until the last scrap of wrapping paper is tossed.
 Throughout middle-class Delaware County in suburban Columbus, Ohio, members of Liberty Presbyterian Church who once donated generously at Christmas now find themselves in the devastating position of having to receive, said Rev. Rebecca Hart, a pastor at the church. It was no accident that the Christmas recollections submitted for this year's Advent calendar almost all speak to simpler, less extravagant times: The shoebox from home for a lonely sailor, filled with chocolates, a music cassette and a miniature Nativity scene; a father's homemade carving of outdoor, life-size carolers; the year a defiant 10-year-old daughter refused the role of Mary in the Sunday School pageant, preferring Gabriel instead. (Bigger speaking part.)
 ''If you say, 'We can't afford to do the big Christmas this year,' '' Ms. Hart said, ''that makes you feel like you failed. But if you say you're returning to your roots, to the Christmas of your grandparents, that's powerful, that's positive. That's face-saving.''
 Certainly many are recasting these pared-down celebrations as a return to the true meaning of the holidays. And although railing about commercialism has been a fine American tradition since at least 1965, when Charlie Brown first rescued that flimsy little evergreen, this is the year that hand- wringing and reality may finally meet.
 Telling others that gifts, of necessity, will be modest is a ticklish business. Ellen Wachtel, a family therapist in Manhattan, said one-upmanship around presents is often frontloaded with unspoken tension, but the economy now gives cover to a blunt conversation. ''You can say, 'Please don't give my kid such an elaborate gift because I can't reciprocate.' ''
 Many of the newly affected choose to maintain their game faces by saying that simpler is not necessarily better. Just temporary.
 In past years, the Christmases of Carl Sartori, a marketing and advertising manager from Bloomfield, N.J., had been joyously over-the-top celebrations. On Christmas morning, hordes would descend on his home to open presents. Mr. Sartori himself bought gifts for nearly 30 children.
 But in October, Mr. Sartori was laid off. 
 The Thanksgiving dinner that Mr. Sartori hosts was trimmed back. The family's supermarket savings card yielded a free turkey and ham. Relatives were asked to bring side dishes.
 On Christmas morning, the horde of in-laws, as usual, will arrive for the great unwrapping. But only a scant few boxes in the pile will be from Mr. Sartori.
 For now, Mr. Sartori, who will still appear at his daughter's school and charity events as Santa's rep in New Jersey, presents himself as an upbeat guy. This year is just a stumble, he says. His inability to buy gifts for children will not spoil his holiday. Wretched excess will make a comeback, he promised: ''I'll double up next year.'' 
 Many others interviewed thought that the changes they were making this year were not detours, but new roads. Jean Craciun, who owns a market research firm in Anchorage, did well this year, but her partner's Body Shop franchise faltered. Their family of four could not afford to fly to Minnesota to spend Thanksgiving with her partner's extended clan, where adults typically pick names out of a hat for Christmas gift exchanges.
 ''Thanksgiving is becoming more about what we're thankful for and what we can give,'' said Ms. Craciun, who planned to stay in Alaska and volunteer with their young children at community programs. 
 They will send presents to nieces and nephews in Cleveland, whose parents are struggling. Adult-to-adult gifts won't happen. ''Once there's a family member who can't afford it, the tradition of the big family gift exchange has to go away,'' she said. ''The conversation has to be, 'Let's chip in together to pay attention to family members who are hardest hit and make sure the kids get gifts.' ''
 Ah, the children. Much of these holiday-related anxieties spring from fears that this special time will be blackened with the coal of gift deprivation. Daniel Cook, who teaches childhood studies at Rutgers, said: ''In the last 20 years, not having an overabundant Christmas somehow became a sign of bad parenting.''
 Most parents would prefer to sacrifice their own niceties, he said, to preserve the holidays as childhood's signature magical sphere. But the children can handle a reduced holiday, psychologists say. Evan Imber-Black, a therapist in New York who writes about family rituals, said, ''You can give children a sense of plentifulness in a different way than gifts under the tree.'' 
 By giving a daughter earrings that her own mother gave her at that age, a mother reinforces family connections, Dr. Imber-Black said. By making a gift list and paring it down to one choice, children learn decision-making. 
 And even for the recently empty-handed, there can be positives.
 The big Hanukkah parties always used to be at Randi Simko's home in Farmington Hills, Mich., a comfortable suburb of Detroit: hundreds of latkes, dreidel hot pads, the house decked with blue-and-white dreidel lights, Star of David pasta and, of course, gifts all eight nights for the three children.
 That was before the divorce and long before the house Ms. Simko bought from her ex-husband was lost to foreclosure. Two Hanukkahs ago, she had to turn to her congregation's ''No Temple Family Without Hanukkah'' program.
 ''It was horrid for me,'' recalled Ms. Simko, who now works three jobs. ''I was embarrassed.'' Needy members of Temple Israel in West Bloomfield, Mich., submit a minimal gift list for their children, purchased anonymously by other congregants. ''I didn't tell my kids where it came from,'' Ms. Simko said.
 But like so many whose holiday traditions have been shredded recently, Ms. Simko, who has again applied to the program, realigned her attitude. ''I had to stop pretending,'' she said. ''Last year I told the kids: I want them to understand there are good people out there doing good things.'' 
 Many families will cling to their holiday traditions, because of, and in spite of, the year's upheavals. Certainly, a Sioux Falls, S.D., grandmother has had her share: she and her husband lost weeks of wages, after both had strokes. Their towering medical bills perch atop a mountain range of debt. No Christmas gifts for the five grandchildren.
 ''They're good kids,'' said the woman, who did not want to be identified because she is mortified. ''It hurts.''
 But she will again make Grandma's oyster stew. She will unpack all 40 of her Santas and put them on tabletops around the house.
 And this year she expects a new ritual that she hopes will last. ''At least we won't be going into debt for Christmas,'' she said. Having signed up for InCharge, a nonprofit debt management program, she no longer uses a credit card.
 ''This year when we see a plain white envelope in the mail box, it won't be a late bill,'' she said. ''Maybe it will just be a late Christmas card.''

 DEPORTED FROM AMERICA,
 Dancer Lands on His Feet
 Tuy Sobil did not know he was not an American citizen until he was 18 and convicted of armed robbery. Deported from California to the homeland of his parents, Cambodia, he arrived without possessions and without contacts. But now he stands out as a success, both in finding a calling -- he earns a living teaching break dancing to about 150 youngsters, one of them above -- and in embracing his fate. PAGE 8
 OPEC CONSIDERS CUTS
 Faced with plunging oil prices and shrinking revenues, members of OPEC suggested they might lower production for the third time this year when they meet next month. But after six years of rising prices and little tension within the group, members are growing distrustful of one another's pledges to trim production. As a result, OPEC has proved ineffective at slowing the slide in prices. PAGE 9 
 CLAIMS RATTLE UKRAINE
 Ukraine's pro-Russian opposition has been leveling potentially damaging allegations of improper arms sales to Georgia during that country's brief war with Russia. It has provided no evidence, but the claims alone have helped to further undermine the government's authority at a time of heightened political instability, while stoking Ukraine's already tense relationship with neighboring Russia.

 NEW YORK
 OFFICIALS APPEAR COOL
 To Transit Rescue Ideas
 A plan to rescue the Metropolitan Transportation Authority from its deepest financial crisis in decades is expected to include proposals for a corporate payroll tax, tolls on free bridges and an increase in fares on the subway, bus and commuter railroads. But as the state and the city grapple with their own serious budget problems, politicians at City Hall and in Albany seem in no rush to embrace the ideas. PAGE 30
 HAGGLING FOR YANKEE SEATS
 The Bloomberg administration was so intent on obtaining a free luxury suite and seats for its use at the new Yankee Stadium, newly released e-mail messages show, that the mayor's aides pushed for a larger suite and free food, and eventually gave the Yankees an additional 250 parking spaces in exchange. The city also turned over the rights to three new billboards along the Major Deegan Expressway. PAGE 30
 NATIONAL
 INAUGURATION WILL STRAIN
 Resources in the Capital
 Washington is practiced at handling big events. But the inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama will put an unusual strain on local resources, and the city has been allotted only about $15 million in federal money to help pay for all major events for the entire year -- roughly $2.3 million less than the city spent for President Bush's second inauguration. PAGE 34
 SPORTS
 GIANTS EVOLVE
 Into Team Coughlin
 Defensive end Osi Umenyiora, the only Giants player to be named to the Pro Bowl last year, is out with an injury. The likely future Hall of Famer Michael Strahan is retired, the attention-grabbing tight end Jeremy Shockey has been traded. Five new starters joined this year's defense. Yet the Giants are improved over last year. ''That's team,'' Coach Tom Coughlin said on Friday. ''That's really what the essence of it is.'' PAGE 1
 STRENGTH VS. WEAKNESS
 For the surging Jets, the secondary remains the primary concern. The team ranks 26th in the N.F.L. in pass defense, allowing an average of 239.4 yards a game. And with Denver -- second in the N.F.L. in total offense (382.5 yards a game) and third in passing yards (273) -- coming to town this weekend, the Broncos' greatest strength will meet the Jets' most glaring weakness.

 BOOK REVIEW
 PRUNING THE BOOKS

 If you are reading this item, then perhaps you, too, will someday face the kind of question that bibliophiles with limited space sometimes do: ''Do I really want this book?'' There are two general schools of thought on how to answer. PAGE 23
 MAYFLOWER POWER
 ''The Wordy Shipmates,'' Sarah Vowell's take on the Massachusetts Bay Colony, ''mixes jiggers of various weak liquors -- paraphrase, topical one-liners, blogger tics -- and ends up tasting kind of festive but bad, like Long Island iced tea,'' Virginia Heffernan writes in her review. She also finds the author annoying. But, she concedes, ''I kept reading.'' PAGE 11

 WHERE A BULL MARKET
 Can Still Be Found
 Between a tanking economy and the approach of the holiday season, most people's thoughts are no doubt turning to -- right, the Oscars! The movie business will be celebrating the 81st annual Academy Awards on Sunday, Feb. 22, so it's time to look at contenders. And when it comes to Academy Awards, there is best picture, and then there is everything else. PAGE 1
 TIME TO TALK, TIME TO SING
 ''Spectacle: Elvis Costello With ...,'' set to debut on the Sundance Channel on Wednesday, is a mix of music and talk and music-oriented talk, with Mr. Costello serving as host and musical director. He also performs for -- or with -- all his guests. Stylistically, it is a blend of ''The Dick Cavett Show,'' ''Inside the Actors Studio'' and ''Charlie Rose.'' PAGE 24

 THAT THING BEHIND YOU

 The sea of digital information being recorded by an ever thicker web of sensors, coupled with information gathered from sources like Web surfing and credit cards, is the basis for an emerging field called collective intelligence. It offers powerful capabilities for good, along with the potential for an Orwellian future on a level Big Brother could only dream of. PAGE 1
 DEAL OR NO DEAL?
 Tesla Motors, a privately held company based in San Carlos, Calif., has spent almost all of the $145 million in capital it has raised to date in producing the Tesla Roadster, an electric car that goes fast, looks sensational -- and sells for $109,000. The company says it needs $400 million in low-interest federal loans to bring out a second-generation car, a less expensive sedan that seats five. Good idea? PAGE 3

 You've gotten a bad performance review at work. What should you do? One bit of advice is to count to 10 -- and make it last 24 hours -- before you react. PAGE 9
 TRAVEL
 VISITING THE INAUGURATION?
 Better Develop a Strategy
 Richmond, Va., 110 miles south of Washington, is pitching itself as a ''historic, affordable alternative'' for the inauguration. Baltimore's Tremont Plaza Hotel is offering a $7,000-a-night inauguration package. The Clifton, in Charlottesville, Va., about two hours from Washington, is offering a $1,895 three-night inauguration package. The hope is for spillover business from what figures to be a jam-packed nation's capital. PAGE 4
 THE HOSTS ARE VERY QUIET
 By the 1860s, Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn -- an early example of the ''rural cemetery'' movement imported from Europe -- was already one of the country's premier attractions, ranking up there with Niagara Falls. And it's still worth a visit, along with Woodlawn in the Bronx and Calvary in Queens, all for different reasons. Green-Wood has the most beautiful grounds, Woodlawn has the most intriguing monuments, and Calvary has the best views. PAGE 5

 WANTED: YOUR PRAYERS, 
 And Lots of Them
 Intercessionary prayer, the practice of having others pray for someone, has long ridden the crest of technological innovation. And so it was inevitable that Web sites like prayabout.com, and ipraytoday.com would join toll-free telephone services that allow callers to request that strangers pray for them. Not all the sites are Christian, but most share a belief that when it comes to prayer, quantity counts. PAGE 10
 TOBACCOLESS SMOKE
 Smoking may have been banished from the bars of New York, but not smoke -- at least, not the kind of smoke that is showing up in mixed drinks like the Smoked Julep and the Cinder. ''Smoke gives a drink a culinary feel,'' says a cocktail consultant. (How do you get that job?) But a little goes a long way. PAGE 8
 AUTOMOBILES
 A FOUR-WHEELED SURVIVOR
 Of a Divided Germany
 It was born out of desperation -- the East German economy was so bereft that the communist government decided to convert a plant that made motorcycles and tractors into a car factory. Thus was created the woeful Trabant, a symbol of the failings of state-supervised industry. Demand for the car ended once the Berlin Wall came down, but it still has its adherents. SPORTS, PAGE 9

HEADLINE: When the Downturn Sailed Into Savannah

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: SAVANNAH, Ga. 

 BODY:
 DOZIER COOK founded the construction crane company that bears his name here 35 years ago. He's weathered economic scares over the years -- the wrenching recessions of the mid-1970s and early '80s come to mind -- and he's confident that the current downturn will be no worse. His words ring with optimism.
 ''We have people lined up to buy, and we are losing deals because we don't have enough cranes to sell to them,'' he says, adding that even if the market ''gets bad here, we sell cranes in Russia, Dubai, you name it.''
 But Robert B. Briscoe, the chief financial officer of Dozier Crane and Machinery Inc., quietly contradicts his boss. 
 ''We are battening down the hatches and being cautious,'' he says, ignoring his boss's frown. ''Before the credit crunch we were not as cautious as we are now. We want our bankers to know that. They would be spooked by anyone who showed too much optimism today.''
 And so it goes, as a crisis born in the mortgage collapse and sent into overdrive by Wall Street's financial disaster now spreads to the broader economy. In this port city, near the mouth of the Savannah River, the downturn is chipping away at expansion and prosperity, dimming a 20-year boom. The unemployment rate in Savannah has risen sharply, just as it has across the nation. And cutbacks in output in midsize cities like Savannah are contributing to an accelerating decline in the country's gross domestic product. 
 ''You are seeing a fairly widespread recession, with all major components of demand now in decline,'' said Brian Sack, an economist in Washington for Macroeconomic Advisers L.L.C., a consulting and forecasting firm. It expects the gross domestic product to decline in the fourth quarter at an annual rate of 4 percent, down sharply from the contraction of 0.5 percent in the third quarter.
 For his part, Mr. Cook, 62, remains an assertive, upbeat commander of a company that buys truck-mounted cranes new -- at $450,000 or more a pop -- and then rents or resells them. But four months ago, as economic shifts became more dramatic, he hired Mr. Briscoe, a 56-year-old former banker, to keep himself and his staff grounded in reality. In addition to a hiring freeze and other cost-cutting measures, Mr. Briscoe explained, the company has cut back sharply on the number of new cranes it will buy next year. It made that move largely at the direction of its bankers, who had grown leery of financing an expansion. 
 Even so, buoyancy still holds sway in Savannah. During the Civil War, the relentless Union general, William T. Sherman, spared Savannah in his devastating march to the sea. Residents here think that the financial whirlwind will also ultimately pass them by.
 On Wall Street and in Washington, where the crisis is more palpable, comparisons with the Great Depression are frequent. In interviews here, however, that association was never made. Even those squeezed the most said they expect this recession to be no worse, or not much worse, than others since World War II -- ending in six months, by Mr. Cook's estimate; by late next year, according to others; or, by still others, 18 months at the longest. 
 ''The belief in an early rebound is real,'' said Michael Toma, an economist at Armstrong Atlantic State University here. ''The history of our economy in Savannah has been slow, steady growth since 1990, and we are conditioned to believe this will resume.''
 STATELY antebellum mansions and Victorian homes, many of them newly renovated, fan out from the river here, clustering near rectangular plazas originally laid out in 1734. Savannah is proud of that heritage, and locals are determined to try to ensure that any economic malaise be short-lived.
 No one has a greater stake in keeping the recession mild than Doug J. Marchand, executive director of the Georgia Ports Authority, which operates the port here, a mile upriver from the Atlantic Ocean. It is now the fifth-largest port on the East Coast, as measured by cargo tons; most cargo is shipped in huge steel containers. 
 But the tonnage in those containers, rising at an annual rate of 10 percent or more annually through most of the last 20 years, has lately ''flattened,'' as Mr. Marchand put it, to almost no rise at all -- the first time that has happened in his 13 years as port director. 
 That unanticipated slowdown caught Savannah off guard. The city has four million square feet of newly built, never-occupied warehouse space, intended primarily as temporary quarters for the growing flow of imports. Big as hangars, these buildings sit shuttered and alone in industrial parks sprouting weeds. 
 Mr. Marchand helped ignite the building boom. In a 2004 ''call to action,'' a speech that business and government officials still cite here, he declared that Savannah needed to make room for a vast new crop of warehouses to accommodate the cargo surge. 
 Savannah had benefited in recent years, he noted, as cargo shippers shifted delivery routes away from California and to the East Coast, in order to escape possible strikes near Los Angeles and to avoid cross-country rail delays. Huge retailers like Wal-Mart, Home Depot, Lowe's, Pier 1, Ikea and Target already had warehouse and distribution centers here. Mr. Marchand said Savannah needed even more. 
 Developers, caught up in the euphoria of the real estate bubble, responded quickly to Mr. Marchand's invitation, buying and clearing land for new industrial parks and putting up giant warehouse and distribution centers on speculation. They were counting on companies to quickly occupy the completed buildings. That happened initially, but now demand has petered out. 
 Mr. Marchand, saying the setback is temporary, has nevertheless frozen hiring at the port. He is going ahead, however, with an expansion of its facilities. In an interview, he ticked off the multimillion-dollar projects under way: four new ship-to-shore cranes have been ordered, along with a dozen smaller ones; rail facilities along the docks are being upgraded; and work is progressing on a system for moving trucks through the port more quickly.
 ''I don't know how long this downturn will last, but I don't think it will be a protracted period of time,'' Mr. Marchand said. ''So I think it makes sense to get ourselves ready for more strong growth once this recession ends.''
 WHILE Mr. Marchand and many others await an upturn, Savannah's economy deteriorates. The unemployment rate in the three-county metropolitan area has jumped to 5.7 percent from 3.9 percent a year earlier. Analysts attribute the jump to hiring freezes and a lot of little job cuts. 
 With home sales down 24 percent, the local Coldwell Banker has watched its army of real estate brokers, the largest in the city, dwindle to 180 from 240 last year. ''They just went into other businesses or stopped working altogether,'' said Connie F. Ray, chief executive of the Coldwell operation here, adding that through last year brokers had been averaging $40,000 to $50,000 annually in commissions.
 Manufacturers still have a big presence here, employing 15 percent of greater Savannah's 171,000 workers, but factory employment is shrinking. Georgia-Pacific, for example, which makes paper towels, napkins and toilet paper at a mill here, no longer hires dozens of contract workers. They had been used as a flexible work force, a supplement to the 1,200 regular employees, to step up production during demand surges, now nonexistent.
 ''It is prudent not to bet on demand at this time,'' said Russ McCollister, a Georgia-Pacific vice president. He notes that as output has tapered off, some machines have been taken out of production, and workers are no longer assigned, or brought in, to maintain them. ''We invest in maintenance for those machines that are running,'' he said. ''It is little choices like that that get us through these times.''
 THE much smaller Chatham Steel Corporation, which buys steel in bulk directly from mills and cuts it into beams, pipes and plates for customers, has gone through a similar weakening in demand since late summer. It has also reduced its staff since last year, to 140 from 146. 
 Even so, Chatham's president, Bert M. Tenenbaum, is upbeat. His immigrant grandfather founded the company, which is now a division of Reliance Steel and Aluminum. 
 Mr. Tenenbaum was a big supplier of steel for shopping-center construction, and with that business drying up, he talks of a coming boom in oil and gas pipelines, refinery upgrades, hospital construction and, if the government comes through with significant infrastructure spending, school and wastewater plant construction. 
 ''We think the economy will come back sooner rather than later,'' he says.
 He has cut back on inventory, meanwhile, reducing his purchases from steel mills. Like so many others, he shaves costs in little ways, putting speed governors, for example, on his trucks so they can't go over 68 miles per hour.
 ''That has translated into a 5 percent saving in fuel, which is huge for us,'' he says.
 And so it goes across the Savannah economy: falling retail sales, fewer hotel bookings, a canceled convention, layoffs at Memorial Hospital, an announcement late this month that Great Dane Trailers, a major manufacturer, would soon close its factory here, and weakened tourism in a city that over the last 15 years has built an industry out of visits to its historic downtown. 
 The tourists are still coming. With gasoline prices falling, they've been driving here in growing numbers from Southeastern states, according to the Savannah Area Convention and Visitors Bureau. 
 But tourists are no longer big spenders. Elizabeth Patterson said business at her cigar and novelty store on Bull Street, in the middle of the historic district, has slowed. She said her competitors had seen a slowdown as well. 
 Her top seller once was a $4.75 Nicaraguan cigar, the Savannah Bulldog (also the name of her store). Cigars are still 50 percent of her revenue, which she says was $400,000 in 2007. But revenue is down 30 percent so far this year, mainly because tourists are buying cheaper cigars. They're also purchasing fewer of her other big seller: novelty chess sets, at $35 and up, with pieces modeled on Walt Disney characters. 
 ''They come in and ask, 'What kind of cheap cigar do you have,' '' she says. ''Or they say, 'Just looking.' There is a total softening of our sales.''
 Not surprisingly, the city government's tax revenues have fallen, particularly since August, because of slowdowns from sales and lodging taxes. With home prices and construction down, property tax revenue is no longer rising at its old, brisk pace, and state aid has been trimmed.
 Stuck with a shortfall, the city government has postponed until May a scheduled 2 percent pay increase for its more than 15,000 employees, including police officers and firefighters. It has also delayed for a year a host of capital projects, from building a new firehouse to rehabilitating storm sewers. 
 ''We'll still fill potholes,'' says Christopher Morrill, the assistant city manager, ''but we won't repave any streets.''
 From his perch as chief executive of Savannah Bancorp, John C. Helmken II, a 45-year-old native of this city, contributes to the slowdown, although reluctantly. Most of his clients are small businesses, and they are hesitant to expand.
 Mr. Helmken, like other bankers here, encourages that hesitation. He defines the bank's lending practices as ''defensive.'' Consumer lending is moribund, and with foreclosures having increased, home buying is, in effect, discouraged. ''We still have programs where the purchaser can get by with as little as 5 percent down,'' he says, ''but it is usually 10 to 15 percent and borrowers must verify they have adequate incomes.''
 In any event, mortgages are only 6 percent of the bank's current loan portfolio of $850 million. The bulk of its lending is to small companies, but in the current downturn, the bank is focusing on professionals like lawyers with established practices and steady incomes who are opening or expanding an office.
 ''Dentists fall right into this preferred group,'' Mr. Helmken says. ''It was always a large part of our client base and now we are pushing it more.''
 Dozier Crane is a longtime Savannah Bancorp client, with a line of credit exceeding $8 million. Mr. Helmken describes it as a healthy company. But when Dozier said it would draw down its entire credit line to buy more cranes, Mr. Helmken balked. There were discussions, particularly with Mr. Briscoe, the Dozier C.F.O. In the end, Dozier borrowed less than it originally intended and bought fewer cranes -- which in turn reduced production at the American manufacturers of the cranes, which in turn bought less from their suppliers, and so on up the line, effectively weakening the broader economy.
 ''He said and we said, this is the right thing to do, given what is going on in the world,'' Mr. Helmken said. ''We asked the questions and he confirmed that Dozier would take a more cautious step.''
 THERE are still islands of strength in Savannah's economy. Gulfstream, which has its headquarters here, along with its research facilities and a big factory, is expanding and adding workers. 
 It came into the financial crisis with a backlog of more than 500 orders for its luxury jet aircraft, a majority from wealthy individuals and companies located overseas. Even without another order -- and Gulfstream says orders are lagging -- the backlog is enough to keep production going for about three years. 
 The Savannah College of Art and Design, with 8,000 students scattered in classrooms across the city, is also going strong. Five hotels and office buildings, started before the crisis, are still under construction. Fort Stewart, the huge Army base outside the city, is expanding, adding 3,800 soldiers to the 19,000 already stationed there, many of them living with their families on Savannah's south side.
 Mr. Helmken says he sees evidence of their contributions to Savannah's economy, or at least evidence of the south side's contribution. 
 ''When I go by a Red Lobster inn on the south side on a Friday night,'' he says, ''there are people lined up waiting to be seated.''
 But American cities depend heavily on corporate investment for expansion and new jobs, and that is dwindling here as capital spending grows more slowly everywhere. The Savannah Economic Development Authority, having signed up $360 million in new investment last year, has commitments this year for only $33 million. 
 ''There aren't that many deals in the country anymore,'' says Lynn Pitts, the development authority's senior vice president. ''Everyone has pulled in their horns big time.''

LENGTH: 924 words

HEADLINE: Just Think '007' And Add $269,993

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
STARTING in 1965 with the DB5 in ''Goldfinger,'' Aston Martin has been linked at the tuxedoed hip with James Bond; gadget-packed Astons have been driven by Connery, Lazenby, Dalton, Brosnan and Craig. 
 But given the economy, anyone who can still afford a $270,000 Aston Martin DBS might inspire a real-world film, with enough supervillains and world domination to make 007 quiver. Call it ''The Man with the Golden Parachute.'' 
 Wafting above the crowd is certainly the point. With 510 burbling horsepower from the V-12 power plant, angry stockholders vanish in the mirror. Seething mobs of the unemployed are drowned out by the 1,000-watt Bang & Olufsen sound system. 
 C.E.O.-envy aside, the roughly 300 Americans who will drive home a DBS this year need to know the score. First, ignore the self-appointed accountants who have questioned why the DBS costs $100,000 more than the Aston DB9. I mean, these people drive Hondas. 
 The DBS and DB9 share a lightweight aluminum chassis and the 5.9-liter engine block under their stretched hoods. But the DB9 has been around six years, a virtual eternity for people who want the latest and greatest. Second, the lovely DB9 -- designed by Ian Callum before he cribbed from himself to create the Jaguar XK -- looks even more Jaglike next to this muscled-up Adonis. 
 The DBS isn't just one of the world's prettiest cars. It pulls off the tricky feat of looking insanely fast and expensive without rubbing everyone's nose in it. For all its power -- a 4.2-second eruption gets you to 60 m.p.h.; top speed is 191 -- the Aston is a classic GT, a proper Brit with a noblesse oblige you won't find in a flaming yellow Lamborghini. 
 That Aston heritage dates to 1914, but it took Ford to revitalize the moribund company.
 After 13 years of full ownership, Ford sold out last year to a consortium backed by Kuwaiti oil investors and led by David Richards, a British motorsports entrepreneur. 
 I spent my first day with the DBS balancing euphoria with skepticism. I figured it would drive like any traditional Aston: a buttery high-speed cruiser with a concert-hall V-12, but too soft and gentlemanly to sully itself on twisty roads. 
 Instead, after a warm-up, the Aston sliced through the countryside like an English football hooligan, but with a better singing voice. 
 A dashboard switch maxes out the computer-controlled shocks for high-speed duty, keeping the Aston's body pinned to the ground like a manhole cover. The standard ceramic composite brakes -- which can cost up to $15,000 extra on other exotic cars -- could stand a bit more initial bite, but were triple-espresso strong. 
 An honest-to-God manual shifter -- increasingly rare in cars of this caliber -- amplified the fun. The lever is placed a bit too far rearward for ideal shifting, and the clutch's iffy take-up requires practice for smooth starts. But the lever itself is easy and precise, topped with a slab of cool metal. A paddle-shifted automatic is an option. 
 Then there's that engine, which sounds like money being torn in two. A valve in the exhaust system cocks open under heavy throttle to release the battle cry of the V-12. On that note, the DBS got a dismal 12 m.p.g.
 On this car, pretty much everything that isn't lightweight aluminum is even more expensive carbon fiber, from the featherweight hood and interior door trim to the angry-looking aerodynamic diffuser at the rear. It adds up to a relatively svelte 3,737 pounds, about 100 fewer than the main competitor, the $310,000 Ferrari 599 GTB Fiorano. 
 Swan doors swing open on a slightly upward angle, clearing curbs that would gouge the typical low-slung sports car. High sills make for body-scrunching entry and exit, but it's worth it once you're inside. Semi-aniline leather and a suede headliner were a perfectly matched deep red, making the cabin look like a boutique bordello. 
 Gauges look as fine as a Swiss chronograph. But while I've gotten used to the strange tachometer that spins counter-clockwise, there's still no red line to show peak engine speed. How much could it cost to paint a red stripe on that thing? 
 Other nitpicks, just to make clear that I'm not a total sucker for beauty: lumbar controls are buried between the seats and console in a ''Where's Waldo?'' arrangement. A cheap-looking navigation screen rises from the dash like a ghoul from the crypt of Kia. And the key is called the Emotion Control Unit, which is appropriate since it forced me to keep my temper in check. This fiddly chunk of genuine sapphire and stainless steel must be inserted into a slot just right or the car won't start.
 There's a small parcel shelf in the rear, but owners can opt for a tiny back seat instead -- for children who haven't been sent to boarding school.
 Buyers seeking unrivaled GT performance may choose the 612-horse Ferrari. The 599 GTB is decisively faster than the Aston and its handling is a bit purer. But in my view, the 599 GTB -- which even zealots wouldn't cite as an all-time great Ferrari design -- can't beat the Aston's looks. 
 Such fantastical comparisons tend to embarrass me anyway; it's like asking which superhero would make the best and fastest sushi chef. (My money's on Aquaman.) 
 Still, most car fans, including auto writers, keep a fantasy list of cars we imagine we'd buy if we struck it rich. For what it's worth, the DBS is the first Aston GT to make it onto my mental bedroom wall. Surely there's no harm in wondering how much a used DBS will fetch in 10 years.

BYLINE: By WILLIAM E. LEUCHTENBURG. 
William E. Leuchtenburg is the author of a forthcoming biography of Herbert Hoover.

DATELINE: Chapel Hill, N.C. 

 BODY:
 ON election night, Nov. 8, 1932, Herbert Hoover, in the company of friends and neighbors at his home on the Stanford campus, sifted through returns that were rendering a verdict on a presidency begun so hopefully on a March day in 1929. As she observed him -- his eyes bloodshot, his face ashen, his expression registering disbelief and dismay -- a little girl asked, ''Mommy, what do they do to a president to make a man look like Mr. Hoover does?''
 The campaign had been brutal. Detroit had to call out mounted police to protect the president from the fury of jobless auto workers chanting ''Hang Hoover!'' 
 ''I've been traveling with presidents since Theodore Roosevelt's time, and never before have I seen one actually booed with men running out into the streets to thumb their noses at him,'' said a Secret Service agent. ''It's not a pretty sight.'' 
 Even so, the returns on election night exceeded Hoover's worst fears. The president suffered the greatest thrashing up to that point in a two-candidate race in the history of the Republican Party, and his opponent, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, became the first Democrat to enter the White House with a popular majority since Franklin Pierce 80 years earlier.
 Two features made his defeat especially galling. One was that he knew the outcome was less an expression of approval for the challenger than a rejection of the incumbent. The other was that, despite being a pariah, he was expected to soldier on for nearly four more months -- until March 4, 1933. The 20th Amendment, moving Inauguration Day to January, was close to being ratified but would not take effect until 1937. He was fated to be the last lame-duck president of the old order.
 Hoover determined to exploit this interim to salvage his presidency. No sooner had the ballots been counted than he invited Governor Roosevelt to confer with him. The overture gave every appearance of being an exceptionally generous offer to share power with the man who had vanquished him. In fact, it was the first step of a scheme to undo the results of the election. Hoover acted, the historian Frank Freidel later wrote, ''as though he felt it was his duty to save the nation, indeed the world, from the folly of the American voters.''
 On Nov. 22, Hoover welcomed Roosevelt to the White House. Throughout the meeting, he treated his successor as though he were a thickheaded schoolboy who needed drilling on intransitive verbs. He sought to bully the president-elect into endorsing the administration's policies at home and abroad, especially sustaining the gold standard at whatever cost. Alert to Hoover's intent, Roosevelt smiled, nodded, smiled again, but made no commitment. A frustrated Hoover later vowed, ''I'll have my way with Roosevelt yet.'' 
 Hoover returned to the attack in February. He sent the president-elect a hectoring 10-page handwritten letter that misspelled Roosevelt's name (as ''Roosvelt''). As a consequence of the flight of gold and runs on banks, Hoover wrote, there was ''steadily degenerating confidence in the future.'' His wise policies, he claimed, had brought an upturn in the summer of 1932. Since then, though, he said, there had been a sharp decline because the country was unnerved by Roosevelt's election, for it feared that the new president would embark on radical experiments. Hoover concluded by asking Roosevelt to restore confidence by stating publicly that there would be ''no tampering'' with the currency and that ''the budget will be unquestionably balanced, even if further taxation is necessary.''
 Three days after writing this letter, Hoover told an archconservative senator that ''if these declarations be made by the president-elect, he will have ratified the whole major program of the Republican administration; that is, it means the abandonment of 90 percent of the so-called new deal.'' To another Republican senator, he spelled out what he demanded that his successor renounce: aid to homeowners burdened with mortgages, public works projects and plans for a Tennessee Valley Authority. He also wanted Roosevelt to raise tariff barriers and impose a national sales tax.
 Roosevelt, who regarded the letter as ''cheeky,'' let days go by without replying, fibbing that his response had miscarried. He would not let himself be trammeled by being identified with an unpopular dying administration, so he refused to issue any statement. He would not permit Hoover to rob him of the fruits of victory. On March 4, unfettered, he announced to the nation a new beginning.
 Barack Obama should bear in mind the Hoover-Roosevelt sequence of events as he threads his way through the minefields of the interregnum from now to Jan. 20. Unlike Roosevelt, who was all but invisible in the months before his inauguration, Mr. Obama seized the initiative last week. That course will make for a smooth transition. But the president-elect should also heed Roosevelt's example by avoiding collaboration with a discredited outgoing administration, lest he become enmeshed in political commitments before he is vested with power.

HEADLINE: Economical Homes, Bustling Transit

BYLINE: By MARCELLE S. FISCHLER

 BODY:
IN September, after 17 years in a three-bedroom colonial in the Cathedral Gardens section of Hempstead village, Joanna and Dominick Castoro moved nearby but a layer of luxury away. Their ''dream home,'' around the corner from their old one, is a five-bedroom center-hall colonial with 6,500 square feet of space. It had been a ranch when they bought it two years earlier, for $725,00, but they gutted it and added a second story, for another $350,000. 
 A similar house in neighboring Garden City ''would be close to $2 million,'' said Ms. Castoro, a stay-at-home mom. In Hempstead ''you definitely get more house for your dollar, without a doubt,'' she said.
 But that relative affordability could be due to the depressed state of the village downtown. Mayor Wayne J. Hall Sr., taking a visitor on a tour of the downtown recently, strode past the Hempstead Bus Terminal and the Long Island Rail Road station toward Main Street, with its storefront churches, bodegas and a shop selling pornography. He gazed at boarded-up buildings and empty lots overgrown with grass. 
 ''It needs to be fixed up,'' said Mayor Hall, calling this 26-acre swath of downtown ''definitely blighted,'' but imagining instead a mix of new town homes and apartments within easy walking distance of the bus and train terminals. 
 Why, he wondered, couldn't the village do well with shops and restaurants, like the more upscale Garden City and Rockville Centre? 
 Historically more urban than suburban, Hempstead village, which is in the center of Nassau County, was nicknamed ''The Hub.'' Its downtown thrived into the 1960s, with Abraham & Straus and Times Square Stores department stores as its anchors. Then, in the 1960s, the Roosevelt Field mall in Garden City and the Green Acres Mall in Valley Stream drained its shopping cachet. 
 Mr. Hall is trying to revive the downtown with a comprehensive ''visioning plan,'' leveraging Hempstead's strength as a transportation center, hoping to turn around its negative image and bolster the tax base. Most people acknowledge that it could do with some bolstering, given that Hempstead has an abundance of not-for-profit groups and dozens of churches -- none on the tax rolls. 
 Besides transit-oriented multifamily housing, with 2,500 to 3,000 new units, the mayor's plan aims to redevelop underused parking lots and attract more than 500,000 square feet of stores, restaurants and other businesses with a pedestrian-oriented setting. 
 An environmental study was recently undertaken. A public hearing is scheduled for Dec. 3 on the plan -- the latest in a series of attempts to revitalize downtown. 
 Claude Gooding, the commissioner of the Community Development Agency, says that redevelopment is a way to shift the tax burden, and that in any case, without something to shift it, residents ''will not be able to continue to afford to live here.'' 
 On the other side of the argument, Don Ryan, a village trustee, expresses concern about ''overdevelopment of the downtown area'' in the midst of an economic crisis. He is worried about whether infrastructure systems for water and sewer can support large-scale new development. 
 ''The density we have now is too much,'' he said. 
 WHAT YOU'LL FIND
 Part of the town of Hempstead, this 3.7-square-mile village of more than 56,000 residents has a heterogeneous population: 53.2 percent black, followed by Hispanics, then whites. Incorporated in 1853, it is described in the census as being the oldest and most populous village in New York. 
 At the intersection of Peninsula Boulevard, a major east-west thoroughfare, and Franklin Street, a north-south throughway, is the Village Commons, a retail center with a Staples office supply store and a Pep Boys automotive center, built on the former site of Time Squares Stores. Nearby on Fulton Street is what replaced Abraham & Straus: a strip center with a Home Depot, Old Navy and Stop & Shop. 
 Renters outpace homeowners. Of the 16,000 housing units in the village, 54 percent are rentals. As in much of the rest of Long Island, Mr. Gooding said, an illegal housing problem exists. 
 Fallout from the subprime loan disaster is evident, with plywood covering windows of many ranches, Capes and colonials. 
 But while the village is usually defined by low-income areas like Terrace Avenue and the Hill, it also has pockets of luxury -- one of them Cathedral Gardens, which is adjacent to West Hempstead and just south of Garden City. Though Ms. Castoro sends her four children to parochial schools, she likes the diversity of the neighborhood and the quick response time from the local police department, which has 120 officers. 
 On Greenwich Street, a commercial corridor, nine units are in contract at the Devon, a new 40-unit luxury condominium scheduled for occupancy early next year. Prices range from $249,000 for a one-bedroom, to $429,000 for a two-bedroom two-bath penthouse. 
 WHAT YOU'LL PAY
 Though village taxes are high, home prices are a bargain and getting cheaper. The median price of the 86 homes sold so far this year was $285,000, versus $381,000 on 39 houses that closed in 2006. 
 Of the 374 homes now on the market, 156 are short sales or foreclosures, according to Laura Dupkin Memisha, a broker associate with Realty Advisors Inc. in Wantagh. Prices start at $145,000, for a three-bedroom one-bath ranch, with a bounty of homes available in the $200,000 range. The middle of the market runs about $350,000, with high-end homes ranging from $700,000 to more than $900,000. 
 Nino Perdomo, the broker owner of Espanol Realty in the village, said that prices had dropped about 20 percent in the last two years, inventories were ''very high'' and foreclosures were ''on the rise,'' with an abundance of ''boarded-up homes.'' 
 According to PropertyShark.com, Hempstead Village has one of Nassau County's highest foreclosure rates. In October, one in every 608 homes was scheduled for auction. During the third quarter, the village had 61 new foreclosures, with an average lien of $365,368.
 WHAT TO DO
 The 38-year-old African American Museum on North Franklin Street has five exhibit spaces and is featuring works by the Long Island Black Artists Association through Jan. 10. The museum also offers genealogy workshops and DNA testing to help people trace their families. Workshops are also available in art, film, digital photography and video editing.
 Kennedy Park on Greenwich Street, one of six area parks, offers an indoor gym, a weight room, an arts and crafts room and a meeting room. Outdoor facilities include three swimming pools. The private Hempstead Golf and Country Club has an 18-hole golf course. 
 THE SCHOOLS
 There are 6,046 students enrolled in the Hempstead Union Free School District, which consists of Hempstead High School, the Alverta B. Gray Schultz Middle School, and six elementary schools. Because of overcrowding, trailers are used to supplement space. 
 Hempstead High School, from which Gov. David A. Paterson graduated in 1971 had 272 graduates in 2007. Of those, 118 received Regents diplomas and 34 received Regents diplomas with advanced designation. The school also had 124 dropouts. The district refused to release its SAT averages. 
 A parochial school, Sacred Heart Academy, a Catholic girls' preparatory school sponsored by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Brentwood, has 904 girls enrolled in Grades 9 through 12. 
 Hofstra University occupies 38 acres in the village. 
 THE COMMUTE
 A trip on the Hempstead branch of the Long Island Rail Road takes about 50 minutes to Pennsylvania Station in New York. A monthly pass costs $185, slightly less if bought online. 
 The Rosa Parks Hempstead Transit Center, between Jackson and Columbia Streets, is the terminal and a major transfer point for 21 of the 54 Metropolitan Transit Authority bus lines that serve Long Island. Among them are the N6 to Jamaica via Hempstead Turnpike and the N93 Nassau Hub shuttle, which stops at the Cradle of Aviation Museum and Roosevelt Field. 
 THE HISTORY
 Of the 87 churches in the village, two are among the oldest on Long Island. St. George's Episcopal Church, on Front Street, was founded in 1702 and twice rebuilt -- in 1734 and 1822. Christ First Presbyterian Church, on Fulton Street, was founded in 1644. Its present building was erected around 1850, according to Geri Solomon, an assistant dean at Hofstra University.
 During the Revolutionary War, the St. George's weathervane (which dates to the original edifice) was pockmarked by bullet holes. Around the same time, Christ First Presbyterian Church was being used by the British as a stable.

HORSES AT WORK
 Harnessing Power in Industrial America
 By Ann Norton Greene
 Illustrated. 322 pp. Harvard University Press. $29.95
 Once upon a time, America derived most of its power from a natural, renewable resource that was roughly as efficient as an automobile engine but did not pollute the air with nitrogen dioxide or suspended particulate matter or carcinogenic hydrocarbons. This power source was versatile. Hooked up to the right devices, it could thresh wheat or saw wood. It was also highly portable -- in fact, it propelled itself -- and could move either along railroad tracks or independently of them. Each unit came with a useful, nonthreatening amount of programmable memory preinstalled, including software that prompted forgetful users once it had learned a routine, and each possessed a character so distinctive that most users gave theirs a name. As a bonus feature, the power source neighed. 
 But in the fall of 1872, almost all these power units, better known as horses, came down with the flu, and America faced an energy crisis. In what became known as the Great Epizootic, horse influenza spread from Ontario down the East Coast of the United States, across the South and into the West, eventually reaching as far as California and Nicaragua. Forty-eight hours after it hit Boston, seven out of every eight of the city's horses were feverish and coughing. In ''Horses at Work,'' Ann Norton Greene describes Philadelphia at a standstill: ''Streetcar companies suspended service; undelivered freight accumulated at wharves and railroad depots; consumers lacked milk, ice and groceries; saloons lacked beer; work halted at construction sites, brickyards and factories; and city governments curtailed fire protection and garbage collection.'' The disaster prompted an appreciation of the work done by horses, which had been somewhat overshadowed by the more voguish pursuit of steam power, and The Nation went so far as to publish an essay with the Matthew Arnoldian title ''The Position of the Horse in Modern Society.'' Then as now, many had the idea that over the course of the 19th century the steam engine was fated to replace the horse. To the contrary, the Nation essayist asserted, ''our dependence on the horse has grown almost pari passu with our dependence on steam.'' 
 To bolster that claim with facts is more or less the burden of Greene's book. It isn't an entirely novel thesis. Last year, in ''The Horse in the City,'' Clay McShane and Joel A. Tarr also noted that ''the steam engine actually expanded the role of the horse.'' Nonetheless it runs counter to the intuitions most of us have about the period, and Greene explains the paradoxical thriving of the 19th-century horse with a pleasing balance of narrative analysis and colorful detail. (McShane and Tarr's book, by comparison, offered not so much a history as a congeries of details, though some of the details were splendid, as for example the story of Louis Napoleon, the first Percheron stallion imported to America, who serviced hundreds of mares with what was said to be ''perfect gentleness.'') 
 Greene has an easy time proving her point. Between 1840 and 1910, as America was industrializing and burning more and more fossil fuels, the horse and mule population grew twice as fast as the human population. Furthermore, Greene notes, ''the states with the most railroad miles also had the greatest increases in the horse population.'' 
 So why didn't steam power replace horsepower? The answer is that it did, but not in all circumstances. To cross long distances in early America, one bought a stagecoach ticket and was dragged at a speed of 10 to 12 miles an hour over rutted and uneven roads by teams of horses, one team relaying another along the route, in an experience that Frances Trollope once described as being ''tossed about like a few potatoes in a wheelbarrow.'' Railroads improved on this, because rails were smooth and because steam-powered locomotives were more efficient than horses over distances longer than 15 miles. But horses were more efficient at start-and-stop traveling, and locomotives weren't welcome in cities, because they threw off sparks that set fires and because with some regularity they exploded. Horses therefore often pulled trains once they reached city lines. Because railroads were built by competing private companies, a passenger who wanted to change trains sometimes had to get to a depot on the other side of town. Only a horse or shank's pony could take him there. Most important, while railroads put a large number of goods and people into motion, they delivered to the depot and no further. For the last mile, animal power was the only option in the 19th century. 
 A slightly different synergy obtained on farms. Before industrialization, Greene writes, most farm work was done by humans, assisted by oxen. But when mass production introduced cast-iron and steel plows that cut through soil more smoothly, farmers began hitching them to horses instead of oxen, and when Obed Hussey and Cyrus McCormick invented reaping machines in the 1830s, human farmers hung up their scythes and let horsepower take care of harvesting. Soon machines were also tapping horsepower to thresh wheat and bale hay. In a similar way, once rail was laid in city streets, horses found new work drawing streetcars. ''Horses urbanized 50 percent faster than humans,'' Greene reports. ''At any time between 1860 and 1920, a Boston banker was likely to encounter more horses than would a cowboy or rancher in Colorado or Texas.'' By 1890, there were 12,000 railway horses in New York City. At the end of the century, they and the city's other horses were daily leaving in the city streets up to 3,300 tons of what one 19th-century scholar of horsepower politely referred to as ''the rejected potential energy of incomplete chemical action.'' Horse-drawn streetcars stretched the potential commuting distance beyond the two miles a person could reasonably walk, enabling the wealthy to withdraw to suburbs, and they began to change streets from social spaces into conduits of travel -- two ruptures in the urban fabric for which cars are usually blamed today. 
 In the century's last decade, the horse began to lose ground. Once Frank Sprague figured out how to electrify streetcars in 1888, streetcar companies abandoned horsepower abruptly. For a while the country's horse population continued to grow anyway, perhaps because the demand for horse-drawn freight continued to be strong. (Electric streetcars were not any better at delivering milk door-to-door than steam-powered locomotives had been.) But then horse prices dropped, discouraging breeders. Economics also seem to have brought about a qualitative decline in the work life of city horses. Formerly, teamsters had owned their horses and felt close to them. But the freighting business consolidated. By century's end, the people driving the horses were in most cases mere employees, who thought of horses as company property. As managers demanded the hauling of larger and larger loads, the employees sometimes abused the horses to satisfy them. 
 Humane societies had tried to protect horses for decades, and had succeeded at least in regularizing the killing of the ill and injured. (In the 1890s, New York's humane society shot as many as 7,000 a year, according to McShane and Tarr.) But as horses lost their function in the city, sentimentality took hold, and the horse's image in the popular mind split. The horsebecame on the one hand a sweet emissary of nature, who ought to have been frolicking in pastures rather than laboring, and on the other hand a raw beast, whose manure attracted flies and rats, and the strain of whose muscles was unsightly. In 1899, propagandists of the new horseless carriage warned that the horse was ''an untamable brute which man has cowed and beaten into partial subjection, but which in revenge bursts his bonds occasionally, carrying ruin and death through our streets.'' They promised that the automobile, completely and mechanically subject to human control, would be cheaper and quieter, would save time, would bring about the end of traffic jams and would cause very few accidents. Of course, it didn't neigh, but you can't have everything.

LAYAWAY
 Kmart has offered its customers the option of buying products on layaway for much of its 46-year history. What it has not done during that time, however, was make the layaway plan a central focus of an advertising campaign -- until this year. Maybe you associate the layaway with low-income consumers who have few other options. But in October, Kmart television spots and direct-mail ads positioned it as a savvy and exciting way to shop ''Kmart smart.'' Indeed, the TV spot depicts a distinctly middle-class couple; she piles goods in a shopping basket while he stays home to rake the lush yard. The chain is evidently pleased with the results; in November, the Sears Holdings Corporation, which owns Kmart, announced that Sears itself would follow suit. 
 Clearly the layaway plan is not a new development in the annals of retail. In fact when someone first mentioned the Kmart ads to me, my initial reaction was along the lines of: Layaway . . . what's that again? Kmart's program serves as a reminder. Pick your items, pay 10 percent of the cost plus a $5 setup fee on the spot; your stuff comes off the selling floor and is stored (laid away) for you; pay off the rest in regular (interest-free) installments over eight weeks, and the goods are yours to take home. Should you stop making payments on an item -- or simply change your mind -- it goes back to the shelves, and your money is refunded, minus that initial setup charge and a $10 cancellation fee. You can put a whole shopping cart full of goods on layaway for one fee, and many do, says Tom Aiello, division vice president of public relations for Kmart and Sears. 
 Nancy Koehn, a Harvard Business School historian, notes that buying on installment has a long history; 19th-century-America examples include expensive farm equipment and Singer sewing machines. The layaway option -- which various accounts suggest dates back to the 1920s or 1930s and which is often associated with the Great Depression -- differs in a couple of ways from other installment plans. On the plus side, there's no tacked-on interest. But gratification is delayed, and it's not hard to see why this option lost steam as all-purpose credit cards became universally available. Wal-Mart discontinued its layaway option a couple of years ago, and Sears stopped offering layaway plans on anything except fine jewelry back in the late 1980s.
 Kmart's decision to treat this throwback as a selling point can be traced back nearly a year, when the discount chain began plotting its 2008 holiday strategy. Signs of an economic slowdown were already apparent -- though not so acute as they are today -- and in focus groups, shoppers talked about needing alternatives to racking up a pile of plastic-enabled debt. At least some of those Kmart regulars knew the chain still had layaway, intended to make use of it and suggested more early-season sales to help them get a head start on holiday shopping.
 Kmart has struggled for years to change its image as the has-been retailer competing with more up-to-date rivals like Wal-Mart and Target, so hyping such a musty, old-school service seems risky, to say the least. But times have changed, Aiello says. ''When we talked to customers, they gave us a lot of credit,'' he says. ''They didn't see it as tired or a throwback. They saw it as a really great solution.'' And not just fixed-budget consumers, he asserts, but also ''more affluent people who see it as a risk-free way to get something while it's in stock, at the price they want to pay.'' At Sears, he adds, layaway's comeback was a direct result of consumers simply asking for it. 
 Meanwhile, a site called eLayaway.com lets Web shoppers use a version of the old payment style at a variety of online merchants, suggesting another future for such installment plans. It's hard to know whether fresh consumer interest in the layaway is more than a one-season phenomenon. But it seems the suddenly more attractive feature of the layaway is the manner in which it enforces spending discipline. After all, credit cards don't make people spend unwisely and rack up debt. They just don't prevent us from doing so. Layaway is ''smart'' because makes it harder to behave foolishly.

HEADLINE: If You Post It, They Will Pray

BYLINE: By ALLEN SALKIN

 BODY:
LET us pray that Steve will be receptive.
 On the Web site prayabout.com, Steve's wife, whose online profile notes that she is a Catholic from St. Charles, Mo., asked other users of the site to submit prayers that her husband will listen to his psychiatrist. She also asked for prayers that the psychiatrist will ''see that my husband has major issues that need to be worked on ASAP.''
 The post received 19 prayers in response. Jaqueline1712 from India asked Jesus to heal Steve's broken spirit. A user from Kentucky, whose profile photo shows her hugging a baby, prayed that God would take away Steve's anger.
 ''Give this family hope!'' wrote Mr.Dan2, of New Mexico. 
 Prayer has found a home on the Web. Sites such as prayabout.com and ipraytoday.com have recently joined longstanding toll-free telephone services that allow anyone to request, for free, that strangers pray for them.
 The sites are not all Christian, but most share a belief that if more people pray for something, it has a better chance of happening.
 The requests for prayers can be seen as a voyeuristic window into what Americans are most concerned with, but they are also a potent sign that as hard as times might get, many people still believe in the kindness of strangers.
 On ourprayer.org, a user named Jaslyn wrote on the day before Thanksgiving: ''Please pray for me for my financial accounting 2 exam. This is my 3rd attempt on this paper and I pray that the Lord will grant me wisdom and a clear mind.'' 
 The site, which is run by followers of Norman Vincent Peale, the author of ''The Power of Positive Thinking,'' does not display responses to prayer requests, but users can allow others to contact them directly. 
 The practice of having others pray for you is called intercessionary prayer. It has long ridden the crest of technological innovation.
 In 1890, the Unity Church, a Christian outcropping of the 19th-century New Thought spiritual movement, which emphasizes metaphysical beliefs, began offering a prayer-by-mail service; anyone could write letters asking for church members to pray for them. In 1907, Unity began offering the service by phone. The number then was ''Main-5653.'' In the late 1980s it became 800-Now-Pray, which it still is. About a decade ago, Unity began offering intercessionary prayer via its Web site.
 When people phone Unity, a prayer associate asks their first name and what the person would like to pray for that day. After a shared moment of silence, the prayer associate says the prayer aloud. All prayers are confidential.
 ''We answer the call and God answers the prayers,'' said Lynne Brown, vice president for Unity's prayer services. ''We want to remind those who contact us that God is the answer, and that answer is within them, that divine presence is within them.''
 Unity, which is southeast of Kansas City, Mo., receives about two million prayer requests a year -- 1.3 million by telephone, 500,000 by mail and 200,000 through the Internet. This October, it received 133,910 prayer requests, up 16 percent over October 2003.
 The most common prayers are for physical healing, Ms. Brown said. The second-most requested prayer is usually for inner peace, but, unsurprisingly, there has been a major uptick in the last few months in prayers about financial concerns. 
 The economy is clearly on the minds of users of prayabout.com, which made its debut a year ago and is not affiliated with any religion (although an advertiser is a Christian dating Web site). 
 One user, mmlgallow, requested prayers for his family business. ''Please Father let our business pick up enough to pay our bills and break even so that we do not lose our home. I would also like to pray for the employees that we had to lay off that business picks up enough to bring their jobs back.''
 Remaxhoney of Miami, responded, ''Father in the name of Jesus I pray for their business income to increase to where it was before and more.''
 ''In the kind of times we're living in, there is a hope in finding like-minded people who share our problems,'' said Rodger Desai, a mobile phone technology entrepreneur who is a founder of prayabout.com. ''The Internet is a perfect place to create a market for support and hope.''
 Not everyone is playing nice. ''There have been a lot of attacks on the site from militant atheists,'' Mr. Desai said. ''They have tried to exploit the site to spread their message.''
 Instead of answering prayers, the atheists point to the Web site Godisimaginary.com. The site urges nonbelievers to spread the word by posting links to Godisimaginary on forums, blogs and news groups. 
 Scientists have also weighed in. Wendy Cadge, a sociologist at Brandeis, wrote a forthcoming article for the Journal of Religion surveying 18 clinical studies, some dating back to 1965, on the power of intercessionary prayer to heal people. 
 ''Most of the larger, more scientifically designed studies have found that intercessionary prayer, prayer by strangers at a distance, does not make people better faster,'' she said.
 But Ms. Cadge noted that many scientists who conducted those studies were not satisfied with their conclusions and said they wanted to conduct further studies, suggesting that perhaps the type of prayers, and other factors, need to be considered.
 ''They really think it is possible to get a better result,'' she said. 
 Believers believe.
 Paige Maurer Wheeler, the founder of ipraytoday.com, said the idea for the Web site, which she started last year from her home in Phoenix, came to her in a dream. ''I told my husband, 'I'm going to start a prayer Web site and we're going to show the power of prayer.' He said, 'O.K.' ''
 Ms. Wheeler said she now has thousands of registered users and a stock of testimonials. 
 ''We had a 78-year-old woman fall off a stool,'' she said by telephone. ''She was paralyzed. Her friend wrote in and said, 'Pray for Marsha.' And there she was, the next day, walking.''
 MS. Wheeler said the stock of testimonials would be deeper, but her Web site programmer lost a lot of her data. The loss caused her to re-evaluate her mission.
 ''It's about people praying for each other,'' she said.
 John Lind, the chief executive of the Presidential Prayer Team, a nonpartisan company that sends out daily e-mail messages to 48,000 users suggesting prayers to help the president, the president-elect and other leaders, said that results can be hard to calculate.
 ''There are things we know on this side of heaven that are making a difference,'' Mr. Lind said. ''But there are things we don't know that are on the other side of heaven.''
 He added, ''We'll have to see when we get there.''

HEADLINE: Bargain Hunting? It Looks Good on You

BYLINE: By THE NEW YORK TIMES

 BODY:
With the economy faltering, and people worried about how they will afford gifts for the holidays, many shoppers are heading to outlet malls. Reporters visited some of the biggest and newest outlet malls in the region, where they found packs of shoppers, seemingly undeterred by the economic slump. They spotted a few good deals on designer sneakers, leather jackets and handbags, but found some prices were not better than at regular department stores. Here are their reports, including tips on how to get coupons at some of the outlets for even more savings.
 Woodbury Common
 Central Valley, N.Y. 
 As a shopper, I specialize in gloves, scarves and socks. I buy them because: (a.) they cost less than actual clothing; (b.) one size fits all; and (c.) a bright pair of gloves, in particular, draws attention from areas that need camouflaging. But there are only so many socks, gloves and scarves a stingy shopper can buy, even in a down economy. I spent a recent Friday at Woodbury Common, the 220-store outlet mall here, checking out potential Christmas presents while building my endurance for the holiday slog ahead. I ended up with socks. But I can't blame Woodbury.
 Things started well. As I entered the huge parking lot that rings Woodbury, I felt good. There were no teenage girls in the back seat, plotting to ''surprise'' me with a caffeine-laced drink on the theory that its mood-elevating effect would loosen my purse strings. And the place was almost deserted.
 I headed straight to Neiman Marcus Last Call, where a $207 gray leather Victor jacket caught my eye, as did some leopard pumps: $78. I put them on, walked around and consulted a fellow shopper.
 ''They're gorgeous,'' she said. ''But they'll ruin your feet.'' 
 So I headed for the familiar: hosiery. It was a festival of Spanx: Tight-End Tights, Two-Timin' Trouser Socks and something called Her Thighness, all for less than $20. My daughters prefer a fat check to anything their mother might choose for them, but Christmas stockings must be filled. I would be back.
 Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th, just down the faux street named Grapevine Court, is tidier than Last Call, making it look more expensive. It isn't. If I bought black gloves for my mother-in-law ($95), I could get Kelly green ones at half off for me. Still, $95 was a commitment. I kept walking.
 To Chloe. Beige tones, indie rock, shoppers speaking languages other than English. A jacket wasn't gray, it was anthracite. Pocketbooks were displayed like Ming vases. Next to the pleather Daytripper ($495, down from $795) was a photo of Kate Hudson ''toting this season's latest and must-have accessory.''
 At Anne Fontaine, where $165 white shirts come with tiny bags of potpourri, a saleswoman laughed when I mentioned bargains. ''I've been at this mall four years,'' she said, ''and if you're not a designer shopper, you will not find bargains.''
 Not at Prada, anyway. The Prada store was so minimalist, I thought it was closed. But a friendly saleswoman pointed to last year's line: half off. I still couldn't afford it. But a $500 tweed jumper was adorable -- with a belt at derriere level. All the green gloves in the world could not draw attention away from that.
 The saleswoman disagreed. ''It shows your curves. It says you're a woman.''
 A hungry woman. I headed to the food court. China Taste! Pretzel Time! Au Bon Pain! I settled for Subway, the tweed jumper of fast food. So far, I had spent $7.33. On lunch. I was the only empty-handed shopper I saw.
 But then I seemed to be one of the very few locals at Woodbury that day.
 ''I'd say 75 percent of our shoppers are not from this country,'' said one saleswoman. Woodbury Common, which made Forbes magazine's list of the 10 best outlet malls on the planet this year, aims for foreign tourists. Busloads come from Manhattan every day.
 ''The non-U.S. people are bigger shoppers,'' said Jean Guinup, senior director of marketing for Chelsea Property Group, which owns Woodbury and nearly 50 other discount malls. ''They'll plop down thousands.''
 Operating on this theory, I started going only to stores that disappointed-looking people speaking foreign languages were leaving. Maybe they would be in my price range.
 This worked at Longchamp, where I found a $122 bag for my husband to put under the tree for me. It didn't work at Ellen Tracy, where a camel coat and skirt would deplete the entire budget.
 I decided to go only to stores with ''Outlet'' in their names. Over the mall's speakers Janis Joplin sang ''Oh Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz.'' I knew how she felt. Work hard all my lifetime and can't cram my feet into $49.99 pumps from Factory Shoe Outlet.
 I headed back to Last Call and Spanx. The Tight-End Tights were gone. I snagged one pair of Two-Timin' socks.
 Every shopping story should have a happy ending. Mine came at Banana Republic. Before I knew it, I was in a dressing room with a Kelly green skirt: $35. It was not Prada. But it was cheaper than the Kelly green gloves, and I needed to buy something.
 I wore it to work the next Monday. A colleague examined it.
 ''Well,'' she said, ''it's not exactly investment dressing, is it?''
 SUSAN STEWART 
 Tanger Outlets at the Arches
 Deer Park, N.Y.
 The timing couldn't have been better. With bargains in vogue in the current economy, the new Tanger Outlets at the Arches beckoned. Armed with coupons for its Oct. 23 opening, I set off on a recent afternoon for this pastel-hued Disney-esque rendition of an Italian village, aching for retail therapy and hoping to find a few good deals. 
 Looming like an oasis in the midst of an industrial area, the 800,000-square-foot, $350 million outlet center, chock-full of upscale brands, promised to be a respite from the humdrum strip mall and indoor mall experience that has long defined Long Island's shopping scene.
 Designed around a central piazza, with fountains, cobblestone paths, umbrella tables, covered pathways and pedestrian streets named after Italian cities, the Arches supplied a novel diversion, even if I didn't duck into the 16-screen movie theater for a matinee. (A New York Sports Club hasn't yet opened.)
 I headed first for Juicy Couture, where bubble gum pink-, lime- and lemon-colored velour hoodies and track pants for $139, reduced from $185, lined the racks. I looked in vain for the less garish, albeit more pricey, versions and colors I had seen in department stores. 
 At Kate Spade, where the layout screamed boutique more than outlet, a red leather handbag caught my eye. Though a sales associate said it might be surplus from past seasons or a castoff, the reductions were impressive: Originally tagged at $395, the handbag was reduced to $275. Then a special lowered the price to $176. 
 Steven B. Tanger, president and chief operating officer of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, said in a phone interview that the outlets were ''different distribution channels'' where brand-name manufacturers sell a large assortment of merchandise directly to customers, often with a specially made line. 
 Sometimes, however, ''there may be a time delay,'' he said. 
 Still, prices are not always rock bottom.
 At the Bose Factory Store, a titanium silver Wave Music System, a radio with a CD and remote, was priced at $499 -- the regular retail store price. A 10 percent discount was available only for a reconditioned model, and only in graphite or platinum white. 
 Wandering down the Via Venezia, I combed through sweaters for my sons at the Tommy Hilfiger Factory Store, sifted unsuccessfully through boxes of high-heeled boots at Nine West (8 1/2 narrows were impossible to find) and buffed up my winter wardrobe with discounts on three sweaters at the Ann Taylor Factory Store. (The selection wasn't the same as at a regular mall, but the differences were minor and hardly deal-breakers.)
 Many storefronts were empty. The Arches' 120 to 130 stores are 74 percent leased, said David Blumenfeld, a partner with the Blumenfeld Development Group, the mall's developer, but Wolford and Betsey Johnson, and places to eat including Fratelli Trattoria, Starbucks and Johnny Rockets were not yet open. 
 It was hard to pass Calvin Klein without modeling a white quilted down three-quarters coat, reduced to $179 from $280. (Pretty, but it would look dirty too quickly.) At Eddie Bauer, I tried on vests. 
 At the Neiman Marcus Last Call Clearance Center, I struck gold. 
 In the handbag department, between Botkier, Michael Kors and Carlos Falchi bags, I spotted a Marc Jacobs satchel. The tag listed the price at $1,450, reduced to $1,015 -- still way beyond my budget. 
 But the handbag was discounted another 20 percent. Then came other discounts -- for using a coupon and for opening and using a Neiman Marcus account. Purchase price: $458, with tax.
 I was thrilled. At home, I checked the Neiman Marcus Web site and found the bag for $1,450, but in either white or dark gray leather with silver hardware, not gold. It didn't appear on the Marc Jacobs Web site, either this season or last. 
 I love it anyway.
 MARCELLE S. FISCHLER 
 Secaucus Outlets
 Harmon Cove Outlet Center
 SECAUCUS
 On a recent Saturday afternoon, Linda Scarlett prowled the string of outlet stores that are scattered throughout the warehouses and distribution centers here, hunting for the perfect red coat. 
 A self-described coat aficionado, she pronounced the trip a rousing success. 
 Which means she found her red coat, right? 
 ''I wound up with a green coat, a purple coat and a black and gray coat. Do you think I need three more coats?'' Ms. Scarlett asked cheerfully. ''Of course I do.'' 
 Ms. Scarlett was happy to show off steals from the Ellen Tracy outlet -- a mossy green coat with a gathering detail on the back and a scroll-work coat that was originally $800, marked down to $99 with another 25 percent off. 
 The third, from the Eileen Fisher outlet, will have to be mailed to her Secaucus home, as the store was out of her size 4. Not long ago, Ms. Scarlet said, she visited Eileen Fisher's Fifth Avenue shop, but walked out empty-handed. 
 ''I don't want to pay full price for anything,'' she said. 
 There are really two groups of outlets here, with selections that vary from haute couture to hoi polloi. First, there is the Secaucus Outlets, the umbrella name for about 45 outlet stores spread out over several miles. It is easy to get lost, but that might even add to the thrill-of-the-bargain hunting appeal. 
 In the same complex is the Harmon Cove Outlet Center, an indoor mall with about 20 outlet stores. Most are decidedly lower end, including a dollar store and a Citi Casuals shop with racks of $1.99 turtlenecks.
 Most of the stores in the Secaucus outlet group look as lovely as their full-priced counterparts. The Gucci outlet was packed with shoppers perusing offerings like gold open-toed cork platform shoes (originally $525, marked down to $319). 
 Many of the higher-end options offered both glamorous gowns and timeless classics. At Escada, an olive-green strapless sequined minidress was $1,497, marked down from $4,990. (You'll find slim pickings on sizes, however, with only European sizes 40, 38 and 34 in the store.) 
 In addition to clothing stores, there are furnishings outlets like Bokara Rug and the Door Store. Some of the furniture items at the Design Within Reach outlet are returns; others are new. The couches are tagged with tickets that list the descending markdowns. A low and boxy Bottoni sofa in a red-orange-pinkish hue started at $3,000 and was down to $2,199 as of Nov. 14. 
 Significant bargains can also be found at the Harmon outlet center. At the Samsonite outlet, a small roller bag that retails for $355 is $199. (They're buy one, get another half-off.) The Lenox Factory Outlet is an excellent place to score discounted holiday dishware, like a giant pewter turkey-shaped platter for $50 or a 3-tier silver-toned dessert stand for $39.95. 
 Gary Bochner, the owner of East West Bridal, opened his location at the outlet mall in March but has sold gowns and formal dresses in Secaucus for 18 years. His wedding gowns range from $400 to $2,000; alterations are extra. Mr. Bochner said his business usually did well in a shaky economy because of his lower prices. Now he is feeling the pinch as people are scaling back weddings or postponing them. 
 ''This time it has gotten so bad,'' he said, ''everyone is hurting.'' 
 JENNIFER V. HUGHES 
 Jersey Shore Premium Outlets
 Tinton Falls
 If people felt anxious about the economy on the opening day of the Jersey Shore Premium Outlets here, they were not letting on. Rain was blowing sideways and the news blared that consumer spending was at a historic low. But the parking lot was jammed. A band played beneath a damp tent, and the mall's open corridors, painted sunny blue, yellow and orange, were clogged with sprouted umbrellas and tented strollers.
 Shoppers snaked through the Ugg store, snatching boots and slippers for two-thirds of department store prices. Nearby, they filed politely through Burberry, where $1,100 handbags were marked to half-price. They clustered around tables at Kate Spade, piled neatly with date books and wallets. And outside Juicy Couture -- especially outside Juicy Couture -- they curled in soggy queues for velour track suits. 
 Still, concern in New Jersey, so tethered to Wall Street, seemed to suffuse those who came to cheer the buyers on. State and local officials gathered for a ribbon-cutting ceremony, and nervously eyed shoppers headed toward the mall's 100 stores, some designed as lighthouses. My own goals were modest: a new pair of running shoes and some long-sleeved shirts.
 ''The desire for this kind of experience, especially now, is high,'' said Randy Bishop, mayor of nearby Neptune. ''It doesn't feel 'discount.' ''
 The idea of saving 65 percent in some stores was enough to draw Jessica and Missy Cimato of Howell. The sisters had come with their mother, Marian, to buy their Christmas gifts early. Mrs. Cimato paid.
 ''I get tired of looking at their faces when it doesn't work out,'' Mrs. Cimato said. ''It's just easier this way.''
 Jessica, a college student, acknowledged fears about her future, but brightened as she surveyed her fellow shoppers. ''People manage to get it together for themselves, especially for the holidays,'' she said.
 And when you're looking for work, she said: ''You still have to look good. So why not save by coming here?''
 Mall officials hope to attract precisely such bargain-conscious consumers. 
 ''Our customers are passionate,'' said Michele Rothstein, spokeswoman for the Roseland-based Chelsea Property Group, which owns the center. ''They do their homework, and know how to save.''
 She pointed to the Italian chandelier and soft white walls in the Elie Tahari store. An eggshell-colored leather jacket, marked originally for $1,200, had a price tag of $698. At the counter, a man stood knee-deep in shopping bags, jabbing a Blackberry with his fingers. He looked up at a woman emerging from the dressing room. ''Buy it,'' he said. 
 Others seemed more cautious. 
 ''Of course I'm worried,'' said Theresa Turcotte, who carried new Uggs for her husband and daughter. ''That's why I'm here and not in a department store.''
 Ms. Turcotte, of Howell, grew up in Boston and honed her bargain-hunting skills at Filene's Basement in the days when women tore off their clothing to try on wedding dresses. ''This is a long way from that kind of shopping,'' she said. ''But I still love bargains.'' 
 I share her instincts. And quite swiftly, I found my favorite running shoes at the Nike Factory Store. They cost $59.99, down from $80. The Banana Republic store had not opened yet, and I couldn't find the shirts I wanted elsewhere.
 But I still felt the need for a small reward, so I stepped from the slick sidewalk into the Godiva outlet. I stood choosing flavors when an older woman stormed in. ''I'm hard of hearing,'' she said, to no one in particular. ''I need my chocolate.'' 
 Don't we all.
 GABRIELLE GLASER 
 Clinton Crossing 
 Premium Outlets
 Tanger Outlet Center
 Westbrook, Conn.
 If outlet shopping seems too far out of your way, in Connecticut, the Clinton Crossing Premium Outlets, in Clinton, and the Tanger Outlet Center, in Westbrook, offer Shop and Stay packages at area hotels, with discounted rooms, meals and shopping coupon booklets.
 Call it destination shopping.
 The two outlets, off Interstate 95 near Old Saybrook, are an almost two-hour drive from my home, so I talked my longtime best friend, a major outlet aficionado, into taking a road trip with me. We booked a room at the Water's Edge Resort and Spa on Long Island Sound, just down the road from the Tanger Outlet Center, for $155 rather than the regular $195, through the Shop and Stay deal. The rate included use of the pool and fitness center (which we never made it to because we were too busy shopping), a breakfast buffet and 20 percent off dinner at its restaurant. And the coupon books to both outlets wound up saving us even more.
 After checking in at Water's Edge, we sprinted out for a spree at Tanger. First stop was the management office, an important tip I learned from the outlet's Web site (www.tangeroutlet.com/westbrook). Here, you can find heaps of coupons ranging from 10 to 30 percent off at various stores.
 We meandered along curvy sidewalks, past ornamental evergreens and children riding carousel animals for 50 cents. Unlike many shopping malls that seem desolate these days, Tanger was teeming with bargain hunters. ''In good times, people want a bargain,'' said General Manager John Dolishny. ''In bad times, people need a bargain. And this is about as bad as we've seen it.''
 Our first store was Wilsons Leather Outlet, where I thought I would use the 20-percent-off coupon to buy a leather jacket for my husband to replace his badly tattered, moldy relic.
 I found a brown leather Columbia bomber jacket that retails for $400, priced at $199.99. But instead of using the coupon, I took advantage of a better deal that Wilsons had that day: 40 percent off everything in the store. So the $400 jacket wound up costing $119.99; a ching-ching register moment.
 ''Can you believe this?'' asked Filio Tsapakis of Manhattan, who was buying several Steve Madden handbags for ''crazy deals,'' as she put it. ''I'm getting this $88 bag for $30.''
 My friend and I whirled around the other shops, stopping at the Eddie Bauer, rue21, J. Crew and KB Toy outlets, scratching person after person from our shopping lists, marveling that we had each spent less than $200 for purchases that would have probably cost over $500 at regular retail stores.
 The next morning, we headed for Clinton Crossing Premium Outlets, the biggest outlet mall in Connecticut, with 70 upscale stores.
 Again, we started at the management office, where coupon books cost $5, unless you're on the Shop and Stay plan or belong to AAA, in which case they're free. The store prices are already discounted 25 to 65 percent; with the coupons, you'll save more.
 My friend bought a sweater and shirt for her father at the Bass outlet for $31; their retail price was $98. 
 We found great gifts for label-conscious loved ones at the Polo Ralph Lauren Factory Store, Saks Fifth Avenue Off 5th, Coach, Liz Claiborne and Michael Kors. For $35.80, I got a gray plaid Aeropostale hoodie for my nephew; its retail price: $89.50.
 We wanted to check out another outlet offering, the Shop and Sip package with Chamard Vineyards in Clinton, which has free wine tastings and discounts on bottle purchases for outlet shoppers. But by that point, we couldn't quite handle that extra dimension to shop till you drop.
 So we headed home, our cars packed with packages like the Grinch's sleigh after he pillaged Whoville.

To the Editor:
 Re ''What if a Slowdown Is a Never-Ending Story?'' (Everybody's Business, Nov. 23): 
 The idea that the economic mess may not be resolved for a long, long time is scary, but any discussion of why this could happen should consider the fundamental question of energy availability. 
 All industrialized economies depend on growth to avoid recession or worse. But growth needs the energy inputs from fossil fuels on which modern societies still depend. Recent uncertainty about a reasonable price for oil shouldn't obscure that we are at or near the peak of oil production. Perhaps we can maintain the current production level for several years, but if we can't increase it, growth may not restart within a measurable time.

HEADLINE: We're Going to Party Like It's 1929

BYLINE: By ALEX WILLIAMS

 BODY:
I HEARD a jingle. No, it wasn't an angel getting its wings. It was my iPhone, carrying word that David Monn, the celebrated New York event planner, was on his way to meet me at Kmart.
 I had called Mr. Monn with a challenge: to see if he could design a transcendent holiday dinner party for eight at my West Village apartment on a recessionary budget -- say, $30 a head (or less than one-hundredth the budget he's sometimes used to) for food, decor, everything.
 Mr. Monn said he was game. Considering that he was just back in town from designing the lavish party celebrating the renovation of the Fontainebleau hotel in Miami Beach for 1,500 guests, including Gwyneth Paltrow and Sean Combs, the challenge seemed like handing the artist John Currin a can of Krylon high-gloss and asking him to spray paint a piece worthy of auction at Sotheby's. But Mr. Monn insisted that the tanking economy was actually an opportunity.
 ''The thing about the recession is, it takes the pressure off,'' said Mr. Monn, 45. ''It allows you to strip away all the stuff that's not important and focus on what is: friends, family, togetherness.'' (And potatoes, it turns out; but more about that later.) 
 Mr. Monn, however, probably did not understand how much he would have to strip away -- for starters, everything I knew about holiday entertaining. Even with the domesticating influence of my fiancee, Joanna Goddard, whom I live with, my instincts as a party host seemed to freeze two years out of college.
 Last year, for example, our holiday party looked like an affair catered by Delta House. From 9 p.m. to 2 a.m., about 70 or so sweaty people -- close friends and perfect strangers alike -- jostled their way around the cramped corridors of our apartment, shouting greetings and quips over abrasive party rock pumping out of bookshelf speakers. The kitchen, as is customary at such parties, grew No.-6-train-at-rush-hour crowded as guests braved the sickly fluorescent light and peeling plaster to mix bottom-shelf gin concoctions in red plastic Solo cups. 
 Maybe with Mr. Monn's help, I would do my part to rescue the holidays for others, and perhaps along the way, my own reputation as a host. But I would have to do it for less than some socialites spend on a spa treatment.
 Mr. Monn showed up at the Kmart at Astor Place wearing a crisp cranberry-red corduroy jacket offset by a pert paisley pocket square.
 ''When you have a budget, you have to think, 'What's going to make the biggest impact with the least amount of money?' '' he explained. For my party, for example, he decided on a ''winter wonderland theme.'' This was not simple nostalgia for the days before global warming wiped out the holiday sleigh ride. Rather, he chose it because winter is white, and white is cheap.
 ''There are so many utilitarian items that are in white,'' he said, informing me of our shopping list for that Thursday, two days before the party: a roll of quilting batting ($12.99), for instance, to use as a tablecloth; a 500-sheet bundle of copy paper ($4.89), which he planned to use to make delicate paper snowflake cutouts to suspend from my living room ceiling with fishing line. Cover them with glitter and dim the lights and they might as well be Steuben crystal. 
 Watching Mr. Monn reinvent the humble wares of Kmart was like seeing Gabriel Garcia Marquez channel Martha Stewart. He showed a magic-realist's ability to stare down endless aisles of Crock-Pots, diapers and circular saws, and conjure an ice palace of czarist proportions.
 Still, with only about $100 to spend on groceries, he said, we would have to keep things simple. For dinner, we would start with a pureed-chestnut soup. Perked up by a half-cup of heavy cream and a cup of Sauternes, that didn't sound too austere, I thought, even if the ingredients were inexpensive.
 On a tight budget, we couldn't afford cupcakes from Magnolia Bakery down the street for dessert. Instead, Mr. Monn said, we would make do with an angel food cake from Food Emporium ($4.29). Slather it in store-bought frosting and dried coconut shavings, however, and who would know the difference?
 And for the main course, he said, we would have potatoes.
 Potatoes.
 I could almost see my own skepticism reflect back at me, as if his face were a mirror. Yes, I thought, minimalism is sexy in flush times. But does it have to feel like a sentence in lean ones?
 Mr. Monn assured me that these would be special, twice-baked potatoes, as big as brontosaurus eggs. Besides, throw enough dietary fat into a recipe, and that in itself acts as a form of antidepressant. We would, he said, ''pull the inside out, and fill them with lots of stuff you don't want to tell your doctor about -- cream, sour cream, probably a pound or two of butter.''
 He told me that he had served the same recipe at the wedding of a very prominent social figure, whom he declined to name, and they were a smash. Of course, those potatoes had caviar. In this case, the toppings would be a choice of mushroom ragout and chili. ''People love the permission to be comfortable,'' he said.
 By that point, we had checked off most of the decor necessities from our list. But we were not finished. The next challenge was to move beyond the look of the party and to engage the rest of the senses, he said, explaining that at any party, the first sensation the guests register is smell.
 I shuddered. In the hallways of my dingy apartment building, guests do indeed register smell immediately upon arrival. Unfortunately, it is the byproduct of our neighbors' erratic garbage disposal habits.
 This did not alarm Mr. Monn. He made an executive decision to cut into our rapidly dwindling cash to secure a jumbo pine-and-geranium-scented candle to burn on the mantel ($10.49), which seemed like enough of an olfactory blockbuster to mask any problem.
 After ringing up $72 at the Kmart checkout counter, we headed to our next destination, Jack's 99 Cent Store near Herald Square. A week before Thanksgiving, it was already a madhouse. Politely nudging through the clogged aisles of the deep-discount emporium, the dapper Mr. Monn reminded me of a late-model Bentley stuck in rush hour on the B.Q.E. But he seemed in his element. Stopping at a wall covered in silver and gold Christmas ornaments, Mr. Monn lovingly handled an opaque plastic maple leaf, about four inches, that glistened with silver glitter.
 ''Simple and elegant,'' he said, as if reciting a mantra. They were 50 cents each. He loaded his basket with 20. He would find a use for them, he assured me.
 With the groceries ordered from Trader Joe's and FreshDirect, our shopping was finished -- final price tag: $238.40.
 On Saturday, Mr. Monn dropped by our apartment in the afternoon to set up the room. Watching him work was like watching a film of a tornado run in reverse; he circled the room like a force of nature that threw everything together in a mad whoosh instead of tearing it apart. By the time he was gone, the snowflakes danced from our ceiling like a Calder mobile. Our battered dining table, hauled in from the kitchen, was covered in layers of white; it glowed like fresh snow at first light. He gave us a shot of parting advice -- ''Dress up a little,'' he said, ''it's free.'' And then he was gone.
 Whatever else unfolds during this supposedly downcast season, I would venture to say that eight people have already accumulated five memorable hours.
 We decided to put the evening to the test by reaching out to three interesting couples we were just getting to know, instead of our closest friends. As designers, restaurateurs and artists, each would be a keen judge of the aesthetic touches, we figured. Also, the presence of new people would provide an additional test: would the atmosphere of the party be so intoxicating that six new friends might show up and then leave hours later, sufficiently plumped and liquored, feeling like old friends?
 From the outset, our guests seemed enchanted by the decor. Even I was, and I live there. It looked like a tenement Shangri-La. (Illuminated only by candlelight, who could tell that some of our plaster was peeling?) Two consecutive guests -- Jennifer Ward, an interior designer, and Alison Kelly, a fashion designer -- uttered the words ''winter wonderland,'' unprompted.
 When I told them what was for dinner, more than one guest referenced the Irish potato famine. But after it was served, most guests -- including Tasha Garcia Gibson, an owner of the restaurant Little Giant on the Lower East Side, and her husband, DW Gibson, a writer -- seemed to find this curiously tuber-centric meal as satisfyingly indulgent as the Thanksgiving dinner just around the corner.
 Yes, the distinctively 2008 feeling of holiday austerity was always lurking. Dane Risch, a rock musician, talked about how his family was planning to hold off giving presents this year. Tom Tinervin, an entrepreneur and photographer, said that all of his holiday parties were going to be potlucks. But in the glowing setting Mr. Monn had created, it seemed impossible to sustain the season's de rigueur anxiety.
 Of course, it didn't hurt that we had squeezed six bottles of so-called Two Buck Chuck red wine from Trader Joe's into our budget. As at my last holiday party, the liquor was flowing. And cheap. But hey, I had to keep a little bit of myself in there.

A Time for Faith
 To the Editor:
 ''Passing Faith On, Even If the Dogma Comes With It'' (Generations, by Eileen Greco, Nov. 23) was a timely reminder of the need for faith. I enjoyed her comments about the results-oriented tradition of Catholic prayers as well as the humorous excuses her father and grandmother had for not going to church. 
 The attendance at a house of worship helps many people, but in the end I think the inner sense of gratitude and faith gives us spirituality. 
 Thanksgiving is particularly comforting because it transcends religion and reminds us to be grateful. In these times, we need all the faith we can muster.

 Teardowns and Values
 To the Editor:
 I grew up in Fairfield County, Conn., and Gerri Hirshey's rendering of the place and its conflicting values (''Today a House, Tomorrow a Teardown,'' Nov. 23) was as vivid as the accompanying photos of stone walls like the ones I used to play on.

 Nonprofit Priorities
 To the Editor:
 Re ''Charities Face Needs of Their Own,'' Nov. 23: While most nonprofits anticipate dismal fund-raising in this year's fourth quarter and beyond, according to the latest Giving USA, since 1969 total giving in the United States has grown every year in current dollars, even during recessions (albeit more slowly). So there is money to be raised. 
 The most important things nonprofits should do right now are: monitor their expenses and revenues weekly; assess donor bases to determine weak spots; attempt to distribute contributions over as large a number of donors as possible (should one large donor cease giving); emphasize good stewardship practices; get boards more involved in fund-raising than ever before; rethink or possibly reschedule special events; do all the groundwork for capital campaigns for when the economy improves; and try new strategies like joint fund-raising events with like-minded organizations.

HEADLINE: The Girl in the Green Raincoat

BYLINE: By LAURA LIPPMAN

 BODY:
CHAPTER 10: MRS. ZIMMERMAN COMES TO CALL
 'So she marries this man whose first wife gets murdered, whose girlfriend has a freak fall, whose second wife dies in a hospital -- '
 'You shouldn't have such morbid thoughts,' Mrs. Zimmerman said. 'Your baby will be born warped.' 
 Tess wondered if Danielle had sought Mrs. Zimmerman's counsel on love and marriage. It probably didn't matter. Tess hadn't, and yet here she was, getting her ear chewed off a mere 10 minutes after meeting the woman. 
 Perhaps it was inevitable that Tess Monaghan's favorite girlhood book was ''Harriet the Spy.'' As a grown-up Harriet, she had not been able to avail herself of many of Harriet's techniques -- there were few dumbwaiters in Baltimore into which she could crawl, and a utility belt simply called too much attention to the wearer -- but it was Harriet who taught her to love black-and-white composition books. And she adopted Harriet's practice of trying to figure out what people looked like based on simply hearing their voices. After speaking to Ethel Zimmerman on the phone, Tess decided the wispy-voiced lady would be quite frail, perhaps dependent on a walker and given to an old-fashioned sense of propriety in dress. A hat, even gloves. 
 Ah, well -- not even Harriet batted 1.000 in this particular game. Ethel Zimmerman, a very peppy 70-something, all but bounded into Tess's sickroom, arrayed in a bright blue tracksuit and white Pumas. She was wearing a hat of sorts -- a powder blue visor stamped with the name of an Atlantic City casino. 
 ''Do you gamble?'' Tess asked this vision in peacock blue, stalling while she tried to find her mental footing. She had prepared for a meeting with someone who would need to be coddled. This woman looked as if she could arm-wrestle Tess and win, even back in her pre-pregnancy days.
 ''Do I -- ?'' she touched the brim of her visor. ''Oh, no. Yard sale. Fifty cents. They wanted a dollar.'' She plucked the sleeve of her tracksuit. ''This still had the tags on it. Fifty-five dollars, if you can believe it. I got it for $7 on eBay.'' 
 ''And the shoes?''
 ''Shoes are tough,'' Mrs. Zimmerman admitted in her thin whisper. ''I go to DSW, places like that. I won't wear used shoes. Or underwear. I'm fussy that way.'' 
 She said this with pride and dignity, as if this principle made her unusually finicky. 
 ''Is there something wrong?'' Mrs. Zimmerman asked. 
 ''Oh, no, it's just that -- you're so much . . . bouncier than I expected. On the phone you sounded. . . . '' There was simply no euphemism for ''old and frail,'' so Tess let the sentence go. 
 ''Cancer of the larynx,'' she said with amazing cheer. ''My husband left while I was still in the hospital. Best thing that ever happened to me, that partial laryngectomy, because otherwise, I might not have had a Ralphectomy, and that's what I needed cut out of my life.''
 Wow, Tess thought. And people think oversharing is a phenomenon limited to the young.
 ''So you knew Carole?'' Ethel said, drawing up a chair. ''And she asked you to get in touch with me?''
 ''Sort of,'' Tess said. ''It's complicated. First -- if you don't mind -- could you tell me how well you knew her, if you kept in touch with her through the years?'' 
 ''I've known her all her life. Her sister too. Our neighborhood may not be a fancy one, but it was stable. Her older sister was good friends with my son. Carole was younger, one of those change-of-life babies, we called them then, back when people didn't wait and then start trying to have babies at 40.'' She gave Tess's belly a significant look. 
 ''I'm 35,'' Tess said faintly, wondering if she should add: It was an accident! My boyfriend has supersperm! It defeated a diaphragm and spermicide. This is a zygote of destiny.
 ''Carole's sister, she was like a daughter to me, and my sons felt the same way about the Massingers. They wore a path between the two houses, coming and going. Carole was so much younger; she was more like a grandchild. We all doted on her, but it only made her sweeter. In fact, she was the best-behaved of the lot. People talk about spoiling children as if they are plants that get overwatered and rot at the root. It's actually hard to pay too much attention to a child. A lot of what people call spoiling is ignoring, substituting things for time. These Game Boys, these iPods, all these computers and gadgets -- they let the parents off the hook, don't they? There's a difference between buying a child everything under the sun and spending time with them. I stayed home with my boys, and you couldn't ask for nicer kids.'' 
 Tess couldn't help inferring a judgment. ''My husband and I have the kind of jobs that will allow us to share child care.'' 
 Husband? Had she called Crow her husband just to avoid more unsolicited advice from Mrs. Zimmerman? She felt a little stab of what she decided to call heartburn. 
 Mrs. Zimmerman snorted. ''Sure, if you say so. Good luck with that.''
 ''My mother worked,'' Tess said. ''At the National Security Agency.'' 
 At least Ethel Zimmerman knew better than to criticize a Baltimore girl's mother. ''Glenda Massinger worked, too. Out of necessity -- they always had trouble making ends meet, the Massingers. That's another reason I was so close to the girls. They would come to my house after school. First Danielle, then Carole, 10 years later. Oh, Glenda and Duane worked hard, for all it got them. They died in a car accident.''
 ''Yes, I had heard that.'' 
 ''And Danielle was left alone with her sister, barely 13 at the time. She put her own dreams on hold, got a decent job, made sure that Carole wanted for little. Put her social life on hold too, until Carole was in high school. That's when Don Epstein first started coming around.''
 ''Wasn't he married to his first wife, Mary, then?'' 
 Mrs. Zimmerman nodded, lips pursed.
 ''I tried not to judge,'' she said. Tess found that hard to believe. ''He was her boss, she said they had to work overtime some nights and I turned a blind eye. The thing is, Danielle was younger and older than her years. Responsible about money. Stupid about men.'' 
 ''You didn't like Don Epstein?''
 Ethel Zimmerman considered this. ''No, no -- I can't say that. He was courteous, did nice things for Danielle, treated her well. Oh, the presents he started to give her once they started dating officially. Jewelry, fancy clothes. She was dazzled. Too dazzled. I was worried he was toying with her, that he would move on to somebody else more . . . like him.''
 ''More like him?''
 ''Rich, well-to-do. They tend to stick to their own, rich people.'' Mrs. Zimmerman studied Tess. ''Your husband'' -- she managed to make it sound as if she didn't believe there was one, but perhaps that was Tess's hormone-fueled paranoia -- ''does he have a similar background to yours?''
 Tess had never even considered this. ''We're both only children. . . . '' But that was the single overlap she could see. Crow's parents had ancestors, the kind of families who had arrived in the colonies from England -- not on the Mayflower, but not far behind. His father was an academic, a professor of economics at the University of Virginia, his mother a sculptor. He grew up in a bookish, indulgent household, encouraged to speak his mind and follow his bliss. 
 Her parents, smart as they were, didn't even have college diplomas, and ''bliss'' was not part of their vocabulary. 
 ''A man can't be happy if he marries below his station,'' Mrs. Zimmerman warned darkly, as if she could read Tess's mind. ''Ralph and I may not have gone the distance, but we made a good run at it. But if you start off unequal, it never balances out. That's what I told Danielle, all those years ago. He was rich, he lived high. She'd never be a good fit.'' 
 Tess wondered if Danielle had sought Mrs. Zimmerman's counsel on love and marriage. It probably didn't matter. Tess hadn't, and yet here she was, getting her ear chewed off a mere 10 minutes after meeting the woman.
 ''But Don Epstein's money came mainly from his first wife,'' Tess said. ''The check-cashing businesses belonged to her late father, although Epstein built them up.''
 ''And you see how that ended,'' Mrs. Zimmerman said.
 Tess was beginning to see why Ralph might have bolted. 
 ''There were conflicting reports, around the time of Danielle's death, that she and Don were engaged. He said no, but her sister seemed to believe he had proposed.'' 
 ''I think Danielle might have told Carole that to save face, given how long they had been dating by then.'' 
 ''Did you find her death suspicious?''
 ''Suspicious? Goodness, no. Sad, yes, but not suspicious. Some families are just a magnet for tragedy. I should have noticed that her car hadn't moved for days, but it was Easter time, and I was running around.'' 
 ''Were you surprised when Carole married him?'' 
 ''Actually I didn't know anything about it until I turned on the 6 o'clock news and found out she had left him, taking much of his money. That was quite the shock.'' 
 ''You weren't in touch, then? When did you last speak?''
 Mrs. Zimmerman's face clouded over. ''We had a little falling out, I'm sorry to say. You see, she didn't finish college, dropped out a month shy of graduation. True, she had lost Danielle the year before, and it was a vicious shock. But I told her Danielle would have wanted her to finish, that she had made sacrifices so Carole would have a college degree.''
 ''She stopped speaking to you because you said she should stay in college?'' Lifelong quarrels had been based on smaller things, as Tess knew, but it still seemed sad to her. Mrs. Zimmerman might be a know-it-all busybody, but Carole Massinger could have used a buttinsky in her life. That seemed to be another part of Don Epstein's pattern: he preferred women who were alone in the world. She had yet to find any family for his second wife, Annette, and Mary's only living relation at the time of her marriage was her father, who died soon afterward.
 ''Carole could be quite . . . willful. She said she needed to start over, with new memories. She sold the house -- got a nice sum for it too, although she didn't sell anywhere near the height of the market. She sold everything in it. She said the memories were choking her. She was going to use the capital to start a gift-basket business. She did make a good muffin, I have to say. But I'm not sure that's enough to make it in the gift-basket business. Carole was a little impractical.'' 
 ''She was choking on memories, yet she took up with her sister's ex-boyfriend.'' 
 ''Not until years later,'' Mrs. Zimmerman pointed out. ''After Danielle's death, I think she fell into the habit of leaning on Don. They went to a grief-counseling group together -- that's where Carole and Don met Annette.''
 ''Why was Annette in there?'' Tess asked.
 ''I think she lost her husband to cancer,'' Mrs. Zimmerman said. ''In any case, the three of them began palling around. Carole didn't have anyone else. And Don indulged Carole's every whim.'' 
 ''She told you that?''
 ''That's my guesstimate. As I said, we quarreled. It's not so odd that she would want to marry him, or he would want to marry her. She looks like Danielle. Prettier actually, because she has a real spunky quality. Danielle never got in the habit of standing up for herself.'' 
 ''So she marries this man whose first wife gets murdered, whose girlfriend -- who happens to be her sister -- has a freak fall, whose second wife dies in a hospital -- ''
 ''You shouldn't have such morbid thoughts,'' Mrs. Zimmerman said. ''Your baby will be born warped.'' 
 It was hard, just then, not to order the woman out of the house. She was like some creepy old soothsayer, the very evil eye that Tess had been trying to ward off, and Tess had actually invited her into her home. But Tess stopped and thought before she spoke, a habit that she had spent years cultivating.
 ''Yet you believe that Carole took his money and ran away, just because he says so?'' 
 Mrs. Zimmerman hesitated. ''I don't know,'' she said. ''I don't want to believe that. But computers don't lie, do they?''
 ''They could be manipulated -- especially by someone who owns a chain of check-cashing stores. What do you think, Mrs. Zimmerman, in your gut? Would the girl you knew have done this?''
 Mrs. Zimmerman thought. Thinking was not particularly kind to her face, grooved with age as it was. Cigarettes had not been kind to her. One could argue that life hadn't been that kind to her either. Her husband had left, she had been through surgery and probably chemo and speech therapy. The Massingers weren't the only tragedy magnet on their block in Severna Park. 
 ''Carole never ran away from a fight in her life,'' she said at last. ''Like I said, she had spunk. Danielle was the weak one, rest her soul. She never stood up to anyone.'' 
 ''And if she came to believe that Don hurt her sister?''
 ''She would do whatever it took to bring him to justice.''
 ''You should tell the police that. And the newspaper.'' 
 ''The Beacon-Light? Why would they care what some old lady from Severna Park had to say?'' 
 ''I think they'd like to talk to anyone who knew Carole, who can sketch a more human portrait of her. After all, her side of the story has never been told.''
 Tess didn't wait for Mrs. Zimmerman to think about this, but quickly dialed the city editor at The Beacon-Light, her sole contact at the newspaper. The Blight had been roiled by economic pressures, reducing its staff by more than a third. But Kevin Feeney was a solid journalist, and Tess was delivering him an exclusive, an intimate of Carole Massinger willing to speak at length. There would be no simple ''She was a quiet child'' homilies from Mrs. Zimmerman. She would talk. And talk and talk and talk. Primed like a pump, she spoke to a reporter for so long that it was almost dusk when she hung up. The dog walkers were beginning to arrive in the park.
 ''This is how Carole first came to my attention,'' Tess said. ''She and her dog wore matching coats.''
 ''She always did like nice things. When she was 13 -- 13, mind you -- she got it in her head that she wanted one of those bubble skirts that were so popular. And not just any bubble skirt, but a designer one like Madonna wore. Dulcie and Gabba-Gabba-Hey, I think.'' It took Tess a moment to translate this to Dolce & Gabbana. ''It cost something like $400, and she wanted to go into her savings account. Her parents talked her out of that, thank goodness. So much money for such an ugly thing.'' 
 ''Yet now bubble skirts are back,'' Tess said. 
 ''And Madonna never went away,'' Mrs. Zimmerman said. ''It just goes to show.'' She stood, did a few quick deep knee bends to loosen her joints, stiff after many hours of sitting. Then she was off, leaving Tess to wonder, What did it go to show? The cyclical nature of fashion, the resilience of a pop star or the eternal verity of young girls yearning for thingsthey would regret? 
 Next week: Mrs. Zimmerman becomes a media star.

HEADLINE: The Economy Crashes the Gates

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; Jim Robbins contributed reporting from Helena, Mont.

DATELINE: BIG SKY, Mont. 

 BODY:
Every town has its walls and gates -- some visible, some not -- for keeping things out or in. 
 Here some of the gates are world famous. The Yellowstone Club, a cloistered and cosseted mountain retreat for the super-rich, helped define a style and an era with its creation in 1999.
 The club had 340 members with a private ski mountain only a schuss away from $20 million vacation homes. It was the corner office and the executive suite of gated communities all in one -- an exemplar of exclusivity. 
 But the sense of refuge was an illusion. The global financial crises have stormed even these gilded confines: This month, the Yellowstone Club filed for bankruptcy protection.
 ''The economy caught up with them,'' said L. C. Sammons, a retired physician from Memphis who lives in Big Sky just down the road from the club.
 Other corners of the resort-economy West are taking punches. The Tamarack Resort in Idaho, which opened in 2004 north of Boise, is operating in receivership after the owners defaulted on a $250 million loan. Home construction has halted but the ski area is scheduled to open on Dec. 12. In Utah, the Promontory Club, a 7,224-acre ski and golf development near Park City, declared bankruptcy in March when the company defaulted on a $275 million loan.
 Here in Big Sky, the Yellowstone Club's troubles have been complicated by domestic entanglement. Tim Blixseth, the club's founder, and his wife, Edra, divorced this year, putting the club in her control. Ms. Blixseth then filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, citing the club's inability to restructure $399 million in debt.
 ''The freeze on the credit market put them in a bad place,'' said Bill Keegan, a spokesman for the club. ''They need to restructure their debt, and they realized it wouldn't happen for the opening.''
 To open for the season, Ms. Blixseth asked for an expedited hearing to raise cash, and Judge Ralph B. Kirscher of United States Bankruptcy Court signed an order in mid-November allowing Credit Suisse to lend the club $4.5 million to pay its debtors.
 Montana has a history as a sometimes brutal exurb of capitalism, with tensions between rich and poor and labor and capital a theme since the 1800s. Over the last decade, people with Yellowstone Club-size wallets bought vast swaths of land, spurring the leisure economy at the same time that wage stagnation -- Montana sank to 39th in the nation in median family income, according to the most recent Census figures -- took hold of much of the rest of the state's population.
 Some residents, in interviews here and in Bozeman, an hour north of Big Sky, said they were not particularly upset about the club's plight, given its excesses and presumptions.
 But most people also know someone whose fortunes are tied to the financial engines that made this corner of Montana's economy go in recent years -- wealth, vacation housing and tourism.
 ''It's kind of like a double-edged sword for a lot of people around here,'' said Greg Thomas, a 31-year-old construction worker from Bozeman. ''It's pretty grotesque and ridiculous, but at the same time, a lot of people depend on going up there for jobs.''
 Bill Hopkins was more to the point.
 ''I can kind of gloat on one hand, but I'm not really happy about it,'' said Mr. Hopkins, 51, who works at Yellowstone National Park, just south of here, coordinating volunteer trail maintenance crews. Mr. Hopkins said he disliked the club's environmental footprint -- 13,500 acres of formerly pristine open-space backcountry, now sealed off and built on.
 ''The damage has been done, as far as development there,'' he said, ''so as long as it's developed, I'd just as soon see it operational.'' 
 The reaction to the club's problems in Big Sky, population 2,500, has been filtered through an economic slowdown that was already well under way.
 Mark Robin, owner of the Hungry Moose Deli, said the river of headlights that used to greet him at 6 a.m. each day when he opened the shop -- cars and trucks full of construction and maintenance-crew commuters driving down from Bozeman, eager for coffee and breakfast -- had already slowed to a trickle as housing construction slumped outside the club.
 And the credit crisis had already struck home as well, at a Big Sky ski resort open to the public called Moonlight Basin, which received its financing from Lehman Brothers before it collapsed. Moonlight laid off much of its workforce this fall, then renegotiated its debt, rehired its workers and is planning to open for the season in December.
 Residents of Big Sky say everybody knows how hard the day-to-day struggle can be in rural Montana. Scrambling and getting by is just part of the landscape in a seasonal economy, said Marne Hayes, the executive director of the Big Sky Chamber of Commerce. 
 ''People work really hard to stay here, and it's not always an easy thing to do,'' said Ms. Hayes, who came here from Pennsylvania in the early 1990s and took odd jobs for years to make ends meet. As for economic cycles, she added, ''people who live and work here never thought they were immune.''
 Some of the Yellowstone Club's members, who paid $18,000 in annual dues for years, on top of their $250,000 deposit to join, are not quite so understanding. About 120 of them filed a brief in bankruptcy court asking what became of all the fat checks.
 ''That money seems to be gone,'' the brief states, ''and members want to know why.''

HEADLINE: Bursting The Bubble

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BOSKIN. 
Michael Boskin, a professor of economics at Stanford and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, was the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1989 to 1993.

DATELINE: Stanford, Calif. 

 BODY:
 I REMEMBER taking a group of business leaders to see President George H. W. Bush in early 1991 to impress upon him the severity of the economic downturn. The business leaders had made their points forcefully to me beforehand. I then marched them down to the Oval Office, where they tripped over themselves praising President Bush's handling of the Gulf war. They barely mentioned the economy. 
 The Oval Office and Air Force One are a bubble. Despite trying, no president receives enough information from all sides of a debate, economic or otherwise. Naturally, people are awed by the presidency. But a president needs people in the White House and outside the government who will tell him the bad news, not just the good. Without forthright advice, Barack Obama, like the first President Bush, may find that a faltering economy quickly erodes his widespread popular support. While our views on economic policy hardly coincide, I respectfully offer the following suggestions to Mr. Obama. 
 The most important issues facing the country right now are income, jobs and wealth -- not energy, health care, the environment or the distribution of income. This recession is the real thing, far worse than the two brief, mild recessions of the last quarter-century. 
 Mr. Obama needs to think about everything his administration does through the prism of how it will affect the economy in the next two years. That means postponing, scaling back or slowly phasing in proposals that impose significant costs on the economy. For example, his energy and health care proposals, if enacted, would destroy investment and jobs now, whatever they might accomplish later. 
 He also needs to focus a fiscal stimulus on what works, not a Congressional wish list. The tax rebates earlier this year were saved, not spent. Permanent tax cuts for households, especially in rates, would work better. Tax incentives for business investment, hiring and home purchases are also desirable. And we should expand unemployment insurance on economic and humanitarian grounds. Spending on public works, on the other hand, did not help the Japanese escape a decade of stagnation and recession. Such spending works its way into the economy slowly, so it should be focused on projects of proven national, not local, benefit. 
 Mr. Obama should beware the law of unintended consequences. History suggests that most legislation will produce less than forecast, more slowly, at greater cost. The laudable efforts to expand home ownership to low-income people wound up being a prime contributor to the current economic crisis. Similarly, some well-intentioned proposals to prevent foreclosures by modifying the terms of the three million seriously delinquent mortgages risk setting off waves of defaults on the 52 million mortgages being paid.
 His administration should also be suspicious of trying to pick economic winners and losers with subsidies, taxes and regulation. It doesn't work. Ask the Japanese, the Koreans or the Europeans. Instead, the government should set general goals for the environment, energy and health care -- and then let entrepreneurs, investors, venture capitalists and consumers decide how best to achieve them. No policy that cannot be commercially sustainable in the long run makes sense. 
 Any tax increases should be delayed until the economy has recovered. Raising tax rates is rarely a good idea, but it is especially foolish in a deep recession. On the budget and spending, he should try pilot programs to test his ideas. If they work at sensible cost, he will get broad support to expand them. If not, he should jettison or reform them.
 Mr. Obama should announce that, after doing whatever is necessary to save the financial system, his goal is to exit the bailout business as quickly as possible, in favor of private capital. (We dealt with the savings and loan crisis through the Resolution Trust Corporation without a permanent government role in S.&L.'s.) That would be the single best signal he could send to the financial markets, which are wary of his tax, regulation and trade policies. 
 He should say no early and often to Congress and special interests. People elect presidents to protect them from other people's congressmen. 
 Finally, Mr. Obama should propose some policies also consistent with Republican goals. This would increase the possibility that he could work cooperatively with Republicans in other areas where they will be suspicious of his proposals. For example, confront the reality of widespread capital losses by raising the capital-loss offset against ordinary income in the tax code from $3,000 -- a decades-old limit that doesn't take inflation into account -- to $20,000. Replace some of the 42 percent of federal civilian employees who will retire in the next decade with technology. Find some trade liberalization he can support: if he is limited to areas of the world where environmental and labor standards are strong, how about a free-trade deal among the nations of the European Union and the North American Free Trade Agreement? 
 Those of us who supported the other guy hope Mr. Obama succeeds. We like his top economic appointments, and we will support those of his policies that will help the country surmount its economic and security challenges.

HEADLINE: Never Let Them See You Sweat

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
The economy jolts and stumbles, wars slog on in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the horrors of a new terrorist attack blanket the news and draw frayed attention yet again to our precarious alliances in the world. The watchword for the holidays is subdued; certainly not much inspires celebration.
 Perhaps it is no coincidence, then, that to lead us in crisis, Americans elected a man repeatedly recognized for his uncommon calmness. More than ever, we crave stability, a steady hand, the reassuring face on television. 
 We even elevate such equilibrium to the superhuman: calm, as applied to No Drama Obama, often comes linked to the modifier ''preternatural.''
 But the calm temperament is not so superhuman, nor is it entirely the gift of the chosen few. It can be cultivated, even as the world cleaves around us. 
 So how do we get there without a steady diet of beta blockers and Xanax? Calm, per se, doesn't appear in the taxonomy of those who study personality and temperament. People we might colloquially describe as calm are classified as low on the scale of neuroticism -- a scale everyone is measured on, to a greater or lesser degree.
 How much neuroticism anyone gets is determined largely by genetics. But it is also within our control. Psychiatrists and psychologists talk about emotional regulation -- the ability to manage neuroticism so that even the most nervous of people can go through life appearing and feeling more in control than those genetically predisposed to calmness.
 ''What studies have shown us is that there's great plasticity, even though people are genetically built in ways that make them respond anxiously or not,'' said James J. Gross, a professor of psychology at Stanford University and director of its psychophysiology laboratory. ''Genetically identical people can give very different outward impressions because they think differently, they regulate their emotions differently.'' 
 It's relatively easy to say how outgoing someone is, or how verbal. Those who study personality caution that it's harder to know how calm someone really is under the hood -- several noted that President-elect Barack Obama has had trouble kicking smoking, perhaps hinting at some compulsion beneath the cool. 
 And for all its benefits, coolness can have its drawbacks.
 ''No two people's calmness functions the same for them,'' said John D. Mayer, a professor of psychology at the University of New Hampshire and one of the original theorists on the concept of emotional intelligence. ''The calmness of an airline pilot is really functional and helpful. The calmness of a teacher could be misinterpreted as a lack of caring. It's going to depend on how they integrate that personality attribute with their goals and desires and hopes and functioning.''
 Efforts to classify temperament go back to the four humors of the ancient Greeks (black bile, yellow bile, phlegm and blood) and run through modern self-help shelves and quizzes in women's magazines. Today, those who study personality tend to rank people on several scales, often called the Big Five: openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeability and neuroticism (some theorists identify them by different terms, but these offer the advantage of an acronym, Ocean).
 These are the characteristic ranges that people all over the world have called upon again and again to evaluate themselves and others: do you tend to be interested in new ideas or closed-minded? Organized or irresponsible? Outgoing or shy? Affectionate or unkind? Easily rocked or buoyant in emotional tides? And in what combinations?
 Of these, conscientiousness is often considered the least dependent on genes, and extroversion and openness the most. Neuroticism, the closest barometer of calmness, is also highly determined by inheritance.
 Researchers estimate that about half the variation in our personalities reflects our genes, based on studies comparing, say, adopted siblings or fraternal and identical twins.
 The rest is shaped by environment, though how is harder to know. Birth order may have something to do with it, as did where you grew up. In Mr. Obama's case, his wife has said that Hawaii is the key to understanding his personality. 
 Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose calmness is often recalled in discussing Mr. Obama, may have gotten it from his parents. According to Jonathan Alter's account in ''The Defining Moment,'' when the family was aboard the ocean liner Germania as it plunged beneath a giant wave, F.D.R.'s father remarked coolly, ''We seem to be going down.'' His mother took her fur and nestled 3-year-old Franklin into it: ''Poor little boy, if he must go down, he's going down warm.''
 But many researchers argue for two ways to think about calmness: you are calm, or you learn how to be.
 Imagine two people with equally high measures of neuroticism dealing with the same irascible boss. One gets yelled at and leaves the boss's office perfectly composed; the other gets yelled at and flees to the bathroom in tears or storms out and kicks the wall.
 The difference is that the first person has learned to regulate the neuroticism.
 People tend to think that the confrontation produces the reaction; if you're faced with an irrational rant, who can blame you for falling apart? But researchers in emotional regulation tease out a factor in between: how we think. Between the ''a'' of the antecedent and the ''c'' of the consequence, they argue, is the crucial ''b,'' for belief, which in the case of the person melting down might sound something like: my boss hates me, everyone hates me, I'm a total failure.
 That is the opportunity for emotional regulation.
 Professor Gross, at Stanford, outlines five methods. They are situation avoidance (steer clear of the boss); situation modification (turn your desk so you don't have to look at the boss); attention deployment (when the boss invites you in for a chat, look at the wall, a picture, anything but his face); cognitive change (he's a jerk anyway, what do I care what he thinks?); and finally, repression (concentrate on keeping your face still instead of blinking furiously or twitching in anger). 
 ''Even if you're someone who is initially anxious, you can develop tricks and strategies, so someone on the outside would say: 'Her, anxious? She's awesome at cocktail parties, she's great at public speaking,' '' Professor Gross said. ''They wouldn't understand that if you didn't have those strategies, you wouldn't be able to do those things.''
 This may be easier for some than others.
 George Washington, memorialized as an austere and cool leader, was extremely emotional as a young man, said Dean Keith Simonton, a professor of psychology at the University of California at Davis who has studied the personality profiles of presidents and leaders. ''He cultivated it through sheer willpower.''
 ''It's capitalizing on your worst fault so it becomes your greatest strength,'' Professor Simonton said.
 Certainly, we prize calmness as a strength. 
 Consider the composure of the Air Canada pilot who brought a flight from Toronto to London last January to a safe emergency landing after his co-pilot began to have a nervous breakdown. According to a report about the incident released recently, the co-pilot became increasingly disoriented and belligerent somewhere over the Atlantic and had to be sedated and forcibly removed from the cockpit. A flight attendant, not lacking for calmness herself, then helped land the jet in Ireland.
 But while there is some evidence that complex tasks benefit from calmness, that's not to say it's everything.
 We want our doctors to be calm, but we want them to show emotion and empathy, as well. When the Indian prime minister, Manmohan Singh, finally appeared on television before his shaken country 18 hours after the attacks began in Mumbai last week, Indians criticized him for being too temperate, not emotional enough. 
 There are times when we want our leaders to rouse us out of our complacency. Professor Simonton contends that global warming might have been such a case. ''It's not one of those threats that is obvious. It's not like seeing the twin towers attacked. You need someone who is going to slap people in the face.''
 David Winter, a psychologist at the University of Michigan who has analyzed the leadership personalities of presidents and other world leaders, said, ''I'm not sure I know of evidence that higher degrees of stability are conducive to better leadership.'' Winston Churchill, he noted, was highly reactive and emotional. Calvin Coolidge was calm to the point of phlegmatic. And F.D.R., like Mr. Obama, could be cool to the point of remote.
 For leaders, it is a balancing act -- to lead, but also to be human.
 ''If there isn't a tear after a grandmother who raised you just died, if there isn't a flash of anger against perpetrators or the anxiety that people feel as they lose their jobs, there's not the sense of connection, that this is a real person,'' said Professor Gross.
 ''What we want from a leader is a paradoxical mix, having the emotions we feel, but almost being our better self.''

HEADLINE: Bush Aides Rush to Enact A Rule Obama Opposes

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The Labor Department is racing to complete a new rule, strenuously opposed by President-elect Barack Obama, that would make it much harder for the government to regulate toxic substances and hazardous chemicals to which workers are exposed on the job.
 The rule, which has strong support from business groups, says that in assessing the risk from a particular substance, federal agencies should gather and analyze ''industry-by-industry evidence'' of employees' exposure to it during their working lives. The proposal would, in many cases, add a step to the lengthy process of developing standards to protect workers' health.
 Public health officials and labor unions said the rule would delay needed protections for workers, resulting in additional deaths and illnesses.
 With the economy tumbling and American troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, President Bush has promised to cooperate with Mr. Obama to make the transition ''as smooth as possible.'' But that has not stopped his administration from trying, in its final days, to cement in place a diverse array of new regulations. 
 The Labor Department proposal is one of about 20 highly contentious rules the Bush administration is planning to issue in its final weeks. The rules deal with issues as diverse as abortion, auto safety and the environment. 
 One rule would make it easier to build power plants near national parks and wilderness areas. Another would reduce the role of federal wildlife scientists in deciding whether dams, highways and other projects pose a threat to endangered species.
 Mr. Obama and his advisers have already signaled their wariness of last-minute efforts by the Bush administration to embed its policies into the Code of Federal Regulations, a collection of rules having the force of law. The advisers have also said that Mr. Obama plans to look at a number of executive orders issued by Mr. Bush. 
 A new president can unilaterally reverse executive orders issued by his predecessors, as Mr. Bush and President Bill Clinton did in selected cases. But it is much more difficult for a new president to revoke or alter final regulations put in place by a predecessor. A new administration must solicit public comment and supply ''a reasoned analysis'' for such changes, as if it were issuing a new rule, the Supreme Court has said.
 As a senator and a presidential candidate, Mr. Obama sharply criticized the regulation of workplace hazards by the Bush administration.
 In September, Mr. Obama and four other senators introduced a bill that would prohibit the Labor Department from issuing the rule it is now rushing to complete. He also signed a letter urging the department to scrap the proposal, saying it would ''create serious obstacles to protecting workers from health hazards on the job.''
 Administration officials said such concerns were based on a misunderstanding of the proposal.
 ''This proposal does not affect the substance or methodology of risk assessments, and it does not weaken any health standard,'' said Leon R. Sequeira, the assistant secretary of labor for policy. The proposal, Mr. Sequeira said, would allow the department to ''cast a wide net for the best available data before proposing a health standard.''
 The Labor Department regulates occupational health hazards posed by a wide variety of substances like asbestos, benzene, cotton dust, formaldehyde, lead, vinyl chloride and blood-borne pathogens, including the virus that causes AIDS.
 The department is constantly considering whether to take steps to protect workers against hazardous substances. Currently, it is assessing substances like silica, beryllium and diacetyl, a chemical that adds the buttery flavor to some types of microwave popcorn.
 The proposal applies to two agencies in the Labor Department, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Mine Safety and Health Administration. 
 Under the proposal, they would have to publish ''advance notice of proposed rule-making,'' soliciting public comment on studies, scientific information and data to be used in drafting a new rule. In some cases, OSHA has done that, but it is not required to do so.
 The Bush administration and business groups said the rule would codify ''best practices,'' ensuring that health standards were based on the best available data and scientific information.
 Randel K. Johnson, a vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce, said his group ''unequivocally supports'' the proposal because it would give the public a better opportunity to comment on the science and data used by the government.
 After a regulation is drafted and formally proposed, Mr. Johnson said, it is ''all but impossible'' to get OSHA to make significant changes.
 ''Risk assessment drives the entire process of regulation,'' he said, and ''courts almost always defer'' to the agency's assessments.
 But critics say the additional step does nothing to protect workers. 
 ''This rule is being pushed through by an administration that, for the last seven and a half years, has failed to set any new OSHA health rules to protect workers, except for one issued pursuant to a court order,'' said Margaret M. Seminario, director of occupational safety and health for the A.F.L.-C.I.O.
 Now, Ms. Seminario said, ''the administration is rushing to lock in place requirements that would make it more difficult for the next administration to protect workers.''
 She said the proposal could add two years to a rule-making process that often took eight years or more. 
 Representative George Miller, a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Committee on Education and Labor, said the proposal would ''weaken future workplace safety regulations and slow their adoption.''
 The proposal says that risk assessments should include industry-by-industry data on exposure to workplace substances. Administration officials acknowledged that such data did not always exist.
 In their letter, Mr. Obama and other lawmakers said the Labor Department, instead of tinkering with risk-assessment procedures, should issue standards to protect workers against known hazards like silica and beryllium. The government has been working on a silica standard since 1997 and has listed it as a priority since 2002.
 The timing of the proposal appears to violate a memorandum issued in early May by Joshua B. Bolten, the White House chief of staff. 
 ''Except in extraordinary circumstances,'' Mr. Bolten wrote, ''regulations to be finalized in this administration should be proposed no later than June 1, 2008, and final regulations should be issued no later than Nov. 1, 2008.''
 The Labor Department has not cited any extraordinary circumstances for its proposal, which was published in the Federal Register on Aug. 29. Administration officials confirmed last week that the proposal was still on their regulatory agenda.
 The Labor Department said the proposal affected ''only internal agency procedures'' for developing health standards. It cited one source of authority for the proposal: a general ''housekeeping statute'' that allows the head of a department to prescribe rules for the performance of its business. 
 The statute is derived from a law passed in 1789 to help George Washington get the government up and running.
 The Labor Department rule is among many that federal agencies are poised to issue before Mr. Bush turns over the White House to Mr. Obama.
 One rule would allow coal companies to dump rock and dirt from mountaintop mining operations into nearby streams and valleys. Another, issued last week by the Health and Human Services Department, gives states sweeping authority to charge higher co-payments for doctor's visits, hospital care and prescription drugs provided to low-income people under Medicaid. The department is working on another rule to protect health care workers who refuse to perform abortions or other procedures on religious or moral grounds.

HEADLINE: Fear Not Where The Ideas Come From

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
BARACK OBAMA may have to surrender his BlackBerry when he moves into the White House, in the interests of presidential security and confidentiality. But there is every sign that his administration will pursue a pro-technology agenda.
 In speeches and policy statements, Mr. Obama has repeatedly emphasized a need to maintain America's technology leadership in the world and to invest government funds to do so. His campaign platform declared that government policy must ''foster home-grown innovation'' and ''help ensure the competitiveness of United States technology-based businesses.'' Two of his favorite proposals -- roundly endorsed by technology industry leaders and university scientists -- are to double federal funding for basic research over the next several years and to train many thousands more scientists and engineers. 
 But such steps would likely amount to well-intentioned but misguided policies that risk doing more harm than good, according to Amar Bhide, a professor at the Columbia Business School. In a new book, ''The Venturesome Economy'' (Princeton University Press), Mr. Bhide makes a detailed argument that contradicts the prevailing view of expert panels and authors who contend that the nation's prosperity is threatened by the technological rise of China and India, and that America's capacity for innovation is eroding. To arrest the decline, they insist that more scientists and engineers, and more government spending on research, are sorely needed.
 Mr. Bhide derides the conventional view in science and technology circles as ''techno-nationalism,'' needlessly alarmist and based on a widely held misunderstanding of how technological innovation yields economic growth. In his view, many analysts put too much emphasis on the production of new technological ideas. Instead, he observes, the real economic payoff lies in innovations in how technologies are used.
 America's competitive advantage, Mr. Bhide explains, resides mainly in its creative use of information technology, especially in the large and growing services sector, led by companies like Wal-Mart.
 ''Wal-Mart and its followers are as much a part of the technological success of America as Silicon Valley,'' he said.
 The globalization of science and technology research, Mr. Bhide added, should actually work to the advantage of the United States economy, so long as America remains the best place to commercialize inventions. As the rest of the world becomes a richer source of inventions, there is less need for the United States to come up with such a large share itself -- and policy, he says, should reflect that reality.
 ''I'm not arguing for reductions in research spending in the United States,'' he said. ''But in a world where investment in high-level science and technology is increasing, there is no compelling reason to invest a lot more.''
 The flaw in Mr. Bhide's thesis is that it amounts to a ''false choice,'' said Robert D. Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan research group. Most of the economic gains from technology, Mr. Atkinson agrees, do come from its innovative use. ''But that doesn't mean that the basic research is not critical,'' he said.
 In fast-moving fields, Mr. Atkinson said, there are immense benefits from the knowledge produced in research projects quickly spilling over into ventures that become powerhouses in new industries. Google, which grew out of a digital library project funded by the National Science Foundation, is among a host of such examples. Where the invention is done, Mr. Atkinson notes, is often vital.
 Yet, Mr. Bhide argues, policy choices and tradeoffs have to be made, and they should be guided by a deeper understanding of how innovation, in all its forms, contributes to economic growth. That analysis, conducted over the last six years, is the basis of his 508-page book, which adds to the emerging field of ''innovation economics.''
 His research builds on, but is also critical of, the doctrine of ''new growth theory,'' developed in the 1980s and '90s. That theory holds that new ideas are the key engine of growth and presents mathematical models, created by economists like Paul M. Romer of Stanford, to simulate the process. The models have been used to justify increasing government subsidies for research.
 But what the math models do not -- and cannot -- capture, Mr. Bhide writes, is ''all the various forms of knowledge generated by the massively multiplayer innovations game that sustains economic growth.''
 What gets short shrift, Mr. Bhide said, is ''midlevel innovation.'' The category, by his definition, is a broad one, ranging from a venture capitalist tweaking a business model to trim costs by a few percent to a technician fine-tuning his company's business software to save a couple of data-entry steps in the accounting department.
 These midlevel innovations, Mr. Bhide said, do not show up in patent counts, and individually they are small steps indeed. But they add up, especially because there is so much of that kind of unsung innovation across the American economy. 
 While others bemoan the state of American education, Mr. Bhide, who graduated from the elite Indian Institute of Technology in Mumbai before he earned advanced degrees at Harvard, is impressed with the general level of creativity and practical skills across the nation's work force.
 Every day, for example, millions of workers are using spreadsheets to do simple what-if calculations to improve some process or operation in their businesses, he said. ''In the end, it comes down to individuals, and you don't need to be a trained scientist or engineer for this broad swath of creatively productive work,'' he observed. ''You need a somewhat more open mind, a willingness to experiment and to innovate in the use of technology, not create it.''
 So instead of tilting policy toward the apex of the education system, Mr. Bhide suggests, it may make more sense to invest scarce government resources further down -- say, in upgrading community college programs. ''The modern information technology economy is going to need a lot of foot soldiers,'' he said.
 ''And our supply of high-level science and ideas in most fields far exceeds our capacity to use it.''

THE GREAT INFLATION AND ITS AFTERMATH
 The Past and Future of American Affluence
 By Robert J. Samuelson
 309 pp. Random House. $26
 Robert J. Samuelson is a conservative from a time when conservatism was more a sensibility than an ideology. His business columns in The Washington Post and Newsweek preach old-fashioned virtue on a macroeconomic scale: don't promise more than you can deliver; weigh the unintended consequences of your actions; beware hucksters bearing easy fixes. Samuelson often directs this advice to government officials -- his nominal subjects are budget shortfalls, interest rates and energy prices. But his rules are every bit as relevant to daily life as they are to public policy. 
 It is therefore no surprise that Samuelson would write a book-length meditation on inflation -- that ultimate symbol of cultural rot masquerading as an economic problem. Inflation-racked countries scorn all the self-abnegating rituals that make capitalism work. They want their guns and their butter and they want them now. So they print money to pay for them. By contrast, low-inflation countries are committed to an ethos of scrimping and toiling that yields long-term rewards. In ''The Great Inflation and Its Aftermath,'' Samuelson studies the transformation of the United States from the first kind of country to the second. 
 The villain in Samuelson's morality tale is a group of intellectuals who came into fashion during World War II, then came into power with the Kennedy administration. John F. Kennedy himself had sound economic instincts. But he was seduced by his chief economic adviser, a University of Minnesota professor named Walter Heller, who argued that more rational management of the economy would produce permanently higher growth. ''Heller was an aggressive salesman for what ultimately became known as the 'new economics,' '' Samuelson writes, but he was ''hardly a one-man band.'' Many of the day's leading economic lights -- James Tobin of Yale and Robert Solow and Paul Samuelson (no relation to Robert), both of M.I.T. -- held similar views. 
 At the heart of the ''new economics'' was a concept called the Phillips Curve, which summarized the trade-off between unemployment and inflation. The idea was that an economy could experience very low unemployment and high inflation, or very high unemployment and low inflation, or any combination therein. Heller persuaded Kennedy to move leftward along this spectrum by stimulating the economy -- effectively accepting higher inflation in exchange for more jobs. 
 It worked for a time. The economy flourished; inflation inched up only marginally. But as the Kennedy administration became the Johnson administration became Nixon became Carter, growth stagnated and inflation skyrocketed. It was clear that, over the long term, the government could no more trade ''a little inflation'' for sustained growth than a drug addict could use ''a little heroin'' for a sustained high. Achieving the same economic payoff required ever more stimulus. Some presidents struggled to control their addictions, while others didn't even try. ''Nixon frequently reminded Burns,'' Samuelson writes, referring to Arthur Burns, then the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, ''that the president's political fortunes depended heavily on the Fed's ability to increase economic growth.'' 
 What the new economists didn't realize was that inflation accelerates: workers demand raises to keep up with higher prices; companies raise prices to keep up with rising wages; the process spirals upward. The only way to break the cycle is with a deep recession, which creates vast surpluses of goods and labor. Companies with scads of inventory eventually lower prices. High unemployment makes workers less pushy. 
 Which is essentially what happened in the early 1980s. Between 1980 and 1982, Paul Volcker, the Brobdingnagian Federal Reserve chairman, raised interest rates so abruptly he knocked the economy out cold. But when the nation emerged from the long, dark night, its inflation habit had been kicked. The upshot, according to Samuelson, was a quarter-century of nearly uninterrupted prosperity. 
 Samuelson is right to highlight inflation's central role in economic history. Beyond a certain threshold, inflation smothers growth, as people spend more time evading price increases than behaving productively. To take one example, inflation creates an impulse to spend today rather than save for tomorrow, when prices will surely be higher. 
 Still, Samuelson can overstate the benefits of low inflation. He claims, with little evidence, that it brought about everything from globalization to the leaner, meaner American economy of the 1990s. His causality is sometimes backward here. It's globalization that helped produce low inflation in recent decades (not, for the most part, vice versa), as cheap foreign labor undercut workers' bargaining power. Likewise, it was primarily globalization, not low inflation, that forced corporate America to shed its extra pounds. Beginning in the 1960s, American companies came under intense pressure from competitors in Europe and Japan, which eroded their profits and made their business models untenable. 
 But the bigger problem with Samuelson's story is that it's incomplete. Over the last decade, American policy makers -- Alan Greenspan chief among them -- came under the sway of the same old siren song: the belief that rational economic management could avert the pain of unemployment. And yet, the same pathologies Samuelson so shrewdly diagnoses in an earlier generation he almost completely ignores today. 
 In 1998, after a global financial crisis threatened the expansion he'd so carefully cultivated, Greenspan flooded the economy with cash (not crazy), then kept interest rates low for more than a year (highly questionable). The extra money led to the tech frenzy that ended so badly in 2000. Beginning in 2001, Greenspan aggressively lowered interest rates and kept them low into 2004. Once again, all the excess cash resulted in a bubble -- this one in real estate -- the bursting of which we're now struggling through. 
 Samuelson mentions these two developments in passing, but they're central to any account of inflation over the last quarter-century. The prices of stocks and homes are every bit as vulnerable to inflation as the prices of toothpaste and sandwich bread, even if government statistics properly account only for the latter pair. And as we're discovering, the consequences of that inflation are every bit as damaging. 
 Put simply, it makes no sense to scold Walter Heller without scolding Alan Greenspan. Why Samuelson fails to do so is unclear. Perhaps his definition of inflation is overly narrow, or he's loath to complicate his historical narrative. I favor the most charitable explanation -- that he wrote most of his book before the housing bubble became evident. In which case I'll happily finish the job for him: Beware oracular Fed chairmen bearing easy fixes. h

HEADLINE: Attacks Imperil Delicate U.S. Role Between Nuclear Rivals

BYLINE: By MARK MAZZETTI and PETER BAKER; Mark Mazzetti reported from Washington, and Peter Baker from Chicago.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
As evidence mounts that last week's attacks in Mumbai may have originated on Pakistani soil, American officials' aggressive campaign to strike at militants in Pakistan may complicate efforts to prevent an Indian military response, which could lead to a conflict between the bitter enemies. 
 In December 2001, when Pakistani militants attacked India's Parliament, and again this summer, when militants aided by Pakistani spies bombed the Indian Embassy in Afghanistan, the Bush administration used aggressive diplomacy to dampen anger in New Delhi. 
 This time, however, the Indian government might not be so receptive to the American message -- and that could derail the coming Obama administration's hopes of creating a broader, regional response to the threat posed by Al Qaeda and the Taliban. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has already faced months of criticism from political rivals in India about his government's decision not to respond forcefully to past acts of terrorism, and domestic anger over the carnage in Mumbai has increased the pressure on his government to strike back. 
 Officials in New Delhi might also feel less compelled to follow calls for a controlled response from the Bush administration, which has steadily escalated a campaign of airstrikes on Pakistani soil using remotely piloted aircraft. The Pentagon has even sent Special Operations forces into Pakistan to attack suspected militant targets, partly in an attempt to stop the militants from crossing the border into Afghanistan, where they are helping fuel an increasingly robust Taliban insurgency. 
 The White House has adopted a clear position to justify those attacks: if a country cannot deal with a terrorism problem on its own, the United States reserves the right to act unilaterally. 
 Should it become clear that the men who rampaged through Mumbai trained in Pakistan, even if the Pakistani government had no hand in the operation, what will stop the Indians from adopting the same position? 
 ''In some ways, it doesn't even matter whether this attack was hatched in some office in Islamabad,'' said Paul Kapur, a South Asia expert at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif., and Stanford University. ''The provocation in this case is orders of magnitude more than anything that's happened before.''
 Even if the Bush administration can keep the situation from escalating, President-elect Barack Obama will find his administration trying to broker cooperation between two aroused and suspicious regional powers. 
 An important element of Mr. Obama's plan to reduce militancy in Pakistan and turn around the war in Afghanistan has been to push for a reconciliation between India and Pakistan, so that the Pakistani government could focus its energy on the tribal areas bordering Afghanistan that are controlled by Islamic extremists.
 Mr. Obama's advisers have spent the past few days watching the unfolding crisis for hints about how the situation might look after Jan. 20. While they said they understand that the tensions unleashed by the Mumbai attacks might hobble the new president's aspirations, they held out hope that the attacks might, instead, open the door to increased cooperation between Pakistan and India to weed out militants intent on more attacks. 
 Some in the Bush administration, as well as outside experts, agree that an Indian military response is not a foregone conclusion. Mr. Singh's government has long believed that the instability caused by a conflict with Pakistan would act as a brake on the rapid economic growth India has enjoyed. Mr. Singh has also seen Pakistan's new civilian government as a hopeful departure from the militarism of President Pervez Musharraf's government.
 Washington could use Mr. Singh's past hopes for better relations to try to shape a modulated Indian response. Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University, said one possibility was that the Indian government could decide to strike Kashmiri militant training facilities in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas, rather than facilities in the heart of the disputed territory of Kashmir, where Pakistan's government has a greater presence.
 Ahmed Rashid, a Pakistani author whose work has been studied by the Obama team, said that any hint of a military mobilization by the Indians will give the Pakistani military the excuse it wants to shift forces away from its western border areas and back to its eastern border. If that happens, he said, it could cause a repeat of 2002, when a standoff between the nations forced the United States to turn at least some of its attention away from fighting the Taliban and Al Qaeda to work to avoid war between Pakistan and India.
 That time, the impetus was an assault on the Indian Parliament in December 2001 that India said was the work of Kashmiri militants. 
 So far, Mr. Obama has tried to walk a careful line during the latest crisis, expressing support and concern without appearing to get in the way of President Bush. Even as Mr. Obama was preparing to host several dozen guests for Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday, a foreign policy adviser, Mark Lippert, and a Central Intelligence Agency official arrived at his house in Chicago to brief him on the latest from Mumbai, according to an aide. Mr. Obama ushered them into a side room as the rest of the house buzzed with dinner preparations. 
 Mr. Obama also called Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice three times over the last few days seeking information. But he waited until after Mr. Bush called Mr. Singh to place his own call to the Indian prime minister late Friday night. (The call was patched through the State Department operations center.) 
 Advisers to the president-elect said that while they were not aware of everything the Bush administration has done during the crisis, they knew of nothing that Mr. Obama would have necessarily done differently. 
 Given the disastrous implications of any armed conflict between India and Pakistan, it is not hard to envision the Obama administration following a similar playbook to the one the Bush administration followed during the two countries' occasional flare-ups. 
 As some experts see it, though, there is a danger in the United States' continuing to intervene directly when tensions between India and Pakistan escalate.
 ''If both sides think they can afford to go closer to the edge because the U.S. is always going to keep them from going over,'' said Mr. Kapur, ''then they are more likely to edge up to the precipice.''

HEADLINE: M.T.A. Needs Champion, But Who?

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN

 BODY:
Two weeks ago, Richard Ravitch, the head of a state commission seeking a way to rescue the Metropolitan Transportation Authority from its deepest financial crisis in decades, addressed some of the city's top corporate leaders at a board meeting of the Partnership for New York City, the city's pre-eminent business group. 
 In a conference room at the Broad Street headquarters of Goldman Sachs, Mr. Ravitch told the board how, more than a quarter-century ago, when he was the authority's chairman, he had escorted the group's founder, David Rockefeller, on an early-morning trip through the transit system to see firsthand its horrendous state of decay. 
 Mr. Rockefeller was so impressed (or appalled) with what he saw that he made it clear to the state's political leaders in Albany that the business community supported Mr. Ravitch's plan for a huge spending program to resuscitate the mass transit system. 
 It is a story that Mr. Ravitch recounts often. But on this particular day, Nov. 17, he was telling it with a purpose to an audience that included Richard D. Parsons, the chairman of Time Warner, and Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs and one of the partnership's co-chairmen. The implication was clear: who would take on Mr. Rockefeller's role this time?
 There is no question that Mr. Ravitch needs help saving the authority again -- but it is far from clear where it will come from. 
 His commission was created by Gov. David A. Paterson early this year to recommend solutions to the authority's chronic financial problems. Mr. Ravitch declined to be interviewed for this article.
 He is due to deliver a final report to the governor by Friday that is expected to include proposals for a tax on corporate payrolls in the region, tolls on the bridges across the East and Harlem Rivers and an increase in fares on the subway, bus and commuter railroads. Those measures would provide enough money for the authority to overcome a $1.2 billion budget gap next year and allow it to finance a long-term capital program that could cost as much as $30 billion through 2014.
 The response to Mr. Ravitch at the partnership underscores the difficulty of his task. Kathryn S. Wylde, the president and chief executive of the group, said ''the overwhelming reception'' to Mr. Ravitch's appeal -- which did not include details of the payroll tax or tolls -- was ''positive.'' But she also said that while business leaders might be open to a new tax to support the transportation authority, they were concerned about the possibility of multiple tax increases as the state and city sought to balance their budgets as well. 
 ''Employers are going to be looking at the overall competitiveness of the region, looking at what the city and state will do on taxes, and they won't disaggregate that from the M.T.A.,'' she said.
 The plan will need backing by more than business leaders. And as the state and city grapple with their own serious budget problems against the backdrop of a sinking economy, politicians at City Hall and in Albany seem in no rush to embrace Mr. Ravitch's ideas. Indeed, many seemed to be waiting for someone else to take the lead.
 So far it is Mr. Paterson who is most closely associated with Mr. Ravitch and his commission, since he created it. But he has not taken a public position on any specific proposal to rescue the authority.
 Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester County, said that for Mr. Ravitch's plan to succeed, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg would have to become a forceful advocate, using his influence in the business community to build support. ''I can tell you with some certainty that waiting for the mayor is what's going on,'' said Mr. Brodsky, who is chairman of a committee that oversees the transportation authority.
 On Friday, Stu Loeser, a spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg, said the mayor would not comment on the Ravitch plan until it was formally released. 
 But he directed a reporter to comments made this month by the mayor in response to a question about whether the Ravitch plan would include new bridge tolls. 
 ''Keep in mind it is really up to the State Legislature,'' Mr. Bloomberg said on Nov. 11. ''I think what we've got to see is what are they willing to do, and then pick out of the options that they're willing to do what is best for the city. Having something that they're not going to do, I think we've been there and done that.''
 From Mr. Bloomberg's perspective, the debate over the authority's rescue is in many ways a continuation of the battle over congestion pricing, his failed plan to charge drivers a fee to use the streets of Manhattan. 
 The plan was supposed to funnel billions of dollars to the authority to improve the transit system, but it died earlier this year without a vote in the Legislature, largely because of opposition by Assembly Democrats, including Mr. Brodsky. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's role takes on an added complexity because of his decision to alter the term limits law and seek a third term. Now he must decide if he wants to run for re-election as a candidate who not only advocated budget cuts and higher taxes in a time of economic crisis but also pushed for tolls on the free bridges to Manhattan, a historically unpopular stance that has tripped up many mayors before him. 
 There is some irony as well in the role of Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who got much of the blame from the mayor for the failure of congestion pricing. So far, Mr. Silver has gone further than others among the state's top politicians in voicing support for a new tax to bail out the authority. He has been less clear about possible bridge tolls, however, saying that it was not certain what role, if any, the Legislature would play in making them happen. 
 The two top leaders in the State Senate, Dean Skelos and Malcolm A. Smith, have both refused to discuss a plan for rescuing the transportation authority until it is made public. 
 The potential for political maneuvering can even be seen on the commission itself. 
 Among its 14 members are the state budget director, Laura L. Anglin, and her city counterpart, Mark Page, each with budget needs that could compete with those of the authority. 
 The commission has not said how it plans to reach a final decision, or whether it will vote on its own proposal. If it did, a vote against the report by either of the budget directors would almost certainly doom it. Abstaining, on the other hand, might signal a lack of support. But in the absence of a formal vote, both the mayor and the governor could continue the waiting game to see how legislative leaders react.

HEADLINE: Hollywood's Bull Market in Ego

BYLINE: By DAVID CARR

 BODY:
AGAINST the backdrop of a historic presidential election and a vortex of economic dysfunction, the burgeoning Oscar season seems even sillier than usual. After all, who really cares about the throwdown for best supporting actor at a time when the citizenry seems poised for a run on its own banks? 
 But watching Hollywood hug itself in an orgy of self-congratulation has some real psychic benefit. Who among us will not enjoy the diversion of watching someone opening an envelope that contains something besides the ashes of your 401(k)? Besides, there is always a bull market in ego, and the movie business will be celebrating the 81st annual Academy Awards on Sunday, Feb. 22, at the Kodak Theater with or without your consent. 
 As the season kicked into gear, some suggested that Oscar backers would rein in spending out of deference to hard times and the bottom line -- Peter Bart, the editor in chief of Variety, wrote a column yowling about the lack of Oscar ads in his trade paper -- but profligacy remains the default setting for the silly season. In just the past two weeks the producers, actors and directors of this season's contenders have been crisscrossing the skies between Los Angeles and New York, holding star-studded screenings, indulging in lavish parties and all but licking the faces of media types and Academy voters in hopes of gaining that ineffable edge. The Carpetbagger, a k a the Bagger, has been on the circuit on your behalf, enduring abundant buffets and spurning proffered cocktails while occasionally saying yes to a portion of Oscar spin. 
 It's helpful to think of the Oscars as a horse race of human thoroughbreds, with backers wagering millions on the marketing of hopefuls, all fighting for the prestige and box-office boost that comes from appending ''nominated'' laurels to their ads. Ultimately, however, when it comes to Academy Awards, there is best picture, and then there is everything else. 
 This year, by the Bagger's count, seven or eight films have a shot at best picture. The consensus, in no particular order -- well, O.K., in a little bit of a hierarchy -- includes ''The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,''''Slumdog Millionaire,'' ''Frost/Nixon,'' ''Revolutionary Road,''''Milk,''''Doubt'' and ''The Reader.'' And a surprise may be waiting in the wings: Clint Eastwood, a durable crush object of the Academy, has a habit of swinging out of the trees late in the game, as he did two years ago with ''Letters From Iwo Jima,'' so keep an eye on ''Gran Torino.''
 With almost three months to go, a great deal can happen. The chemistry of Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman in ''Australia'' may bring to mind oil and water, but the Academy may swoon over the epic intent of the director, Baz Luhrmann (''Moulin Rouge!'' and ''Romeo + Juliet''). The Walt Disney Company is carpet-bombing voters with DVDs to argue that the robotic glories of ''Wall-E'' should not be pigeonholed into animation alone. And there's always a chance that smaller films like ''Rachel Getting Married,'' with a searing performance by Anne Hathaway, or ''The Wrestler,'' featuring the muscular return of Mickey Rourke, might sneak in.
 The Screen Actors Guild makes up almost a fourth of the approximately 5,800 voting members of the Academy, which means that movies that contain big, juicy roles for highly respected actors -- like ''Doubt,'' with Meryl Streep and Philip Seymour Hoffman -- will always have the edge over remarkable filmed spectacle, say, ''The Dark Knight.'' And this year's awards will be particularly driven by some star turns: Frank Langella in ''Frost/Nixon,'' Sean Penn in ''Milk,'' Leonardo DiCaprio in ''Revolutionary Road'' and Brad Pitt in ''Benjamin Button.'' 
 Kate Winslet has had so many good roles in so many good movies that it is hard to believe she has never won an Oscar after being nominated five times. This year she reunites with Mr. DiCaprio in ''Revolutionary Road.'' It's doomed love again for the former passengers of the Titanic, only this time the iceberg is played by a chilly suburban enclave that crushes their spirits and dreams. But she will probably be competing against the likes of Ms. Streep and Ms. Hathaway, as well as Cate Blanchett, in ''Benjamin Button.'' And that's not even counting a possible fifth contender: Kate Winslet, for her much-discussed lead as a former Nazi prison guard on trial in ''The Reader.'' 
 It means that Ms. Winslet will be doing wind sprints to promote both her films. Many actors make it clear that they only tread the carpets of such events with their noses held. Ms. Winslet displays no such haughtiness.
 ''I'm at work right now; this is very much part of what I do,'' she said, surrounded by well-wishers at the ''21'' Club who enjoyed an open bar before sawing into massive filets of beef after a screening of ''Revolutionary Road'' in New York a little over a week ago. ''This is part of the commitment that I make when I agree to do a film, and I am very happy to do it.''
 Ms. Winslet makes it look pretty easy, standing there eating from a basket of frites and smiling through an avalanche of double kisses. She even found time to slip off one of her shoes to answer an admirer's query about her smashing footwear's provenance. (The black satin peep-toe stilettos were made for her hard-to-fit size 11 feet by Rickard Shah.) Her husband and director, Sam Mendes, sitting nearby, said he's a little less skilled at the process, ''but then there is far less demand for me that there is for Kate.''
 Each Oscar season has its own character. Last year it was a season of dark indie wonders, which left us all wondering whether the movie about the homicidal maniac, ''No Country for Old Men,'' or the film about the capitalist sociopath, ''There Will Be Blood,'' would win the day. This year, with the big studios and their specialty divisions in the mix, everything is falling late because few wanted to open their serious, important Oscar film into the headwind of that historic election. Now that that's settled, the films and this season's flurry of subplots are rearing into view.
 Among them: the return to the competition of Harvey Weinstein, after a few years somewhat sidelined, with ''The Reader.'' A full-contact auteur who all but invented the modern Oscar campaign, Mr. Weinstein plays to win, using his contacts with the press and the Academy to lobby (intensely) for his films. This year he and Scott Rudin, another producer who knows his way around an Oscar, had a dust-up over the release date of ''The Reader,'' with Mr. Rudin deciding to take his name off the credits and put his muscle behind ''Doubt'' and ''Revolutionary Road.'' And many will be watching to see if this is that year that Mr. Pitt, whose work is sometime obscured by his celebrity legend, will be taken seriously by the Academy. 
 Oscar ninnies are also curious whether an outsized performance by a supporting actor -- Michael Shannon's work as a deranged one-man Greek chorus in ''Revolutionary Road'' comes to mind -- can overcome the industry's need to memorialize the departed Heath Ledger by picking his final role as the Joker in ''The Dark Knight.'' 
 Sometimes a film's Oscar chances have less to do with the cinema artifact itself than the aura built up over the course of the campaign through ads, news articles and events. At the premiere of ''Frost/Nixon'' about two weeks ago, mediaheavies showed up -- hey, look, there's Bill O'Reilly talking to Mort Zuckerman -- and some then made their way to a decorated Four Seasons restaurant that made Pompeii seem chaste to snack on caviar and gobs of lobster. 
 With the actual David Frost (now a Sir) walking around the room, Ron Howard, who won best picture and best director for ''A Beautiful Mind'' in 2002 and is the director and a producer of ''Frost/Nixon,'' said he was happy for any kind of sizzle, Oscar or otherwise.
 ''A movie like this, a serious movie, needs champions,'' he said, squeezed into a hallway between the Grill Room and the Pool Room at the Four Seasons. Several hundred invitees did laps from one room to the other, backslapping the film's stars, including Mr. Langella, Michael Sheen and Kevin Bacon, and squeezing past well-wishers that included Brian Williams, Tina Brown and Steve Kroft. 
 Many of the events are aimed at breaking films out of various slots they have been assigned. James Schamus, chief executive of Focus Features, said ''Milk,'' a biopic of the slain gay-rights hero Harvey Milk, will pick up some heat from the current angst over Proposition 8, but added that he doesn't want the movie to be seen merely as historical homework. ''This is an epic, with big crowd scenes, a huge scope and an amazing performance from Sean Penn,'' he said. ''We think it is a great big Academy movie, and I have no problem being part of the process because we think we have the goods.''
 They sure had a great, big party, hosted by the Cinema Society and Details magazine. The event, at the Bowery Hotel following the New York screening almost two weeks ago, was so jammed that guests ended up eating cross-legged on the floor as other revelers stepped in and around them. 
 No Oscar season would feel complete without its Cinderella, and this year the glass slipper lands on the bare foot of ''Slumdog Millionaire,'' a movie about a desperately poor young man who finds the answers for the India version of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' in his tortured past and present. It has some pedigree -- its director, Danny Boyle, also did ''Trainspotting'' -- but few expected that a film rendered partly in Hindi would be in the thick of the best picture race. Then again, it opens with a chase in Mumbai and ends with a dance number, so perhaps it isn't that odd. 
 Though economic gloom hovers over the country, many filmmakers and studios are jumping into the Oscar fray with more enthusiasm than ever. ''When you think about it, having a dinner for some Academy members and media people is a very good investment and not terribly expensive,'' said Peggy Siegal, who arranges many such fetes. As she spoke, she made sure the crowd fresh from a screening of ''Slumdog Millionaire'' landed safely at its tables at Circo.
 The tension and oodles of coverage will build with each passing week until it's time to strap on the bow ties and ball gowns to hear the final verdict.
 ''We all say that it is nice to be nominated,'' Mr. Howard said. ''But when you are sitting there, you are really, really hoping that when a name gets called, it happens to be yours.''

HEADLINE: Looking for Obama To Return the Good Will

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER; Gregory B. Hladky contributed reporting from Connecticut, Bruce Lambert from Long Island and Iver Peterson from New Jersey.

DATELINE: WHITE PLAINS 

 BODY:
 BARACK OBAMA's presidential express racked up majorities of more than 60 and 70 percent in a half dozen counties in the region, upending local politics by leaving behind a greatly diminished Republican Party.
 So it should be no surprise that political officials here, particularly emboldened Democrats, are thinking -- hopefully, even hungrily -- about what Mr. Obama's message of change will mean for them. 
 Interviews suggest that local power brokers and policy makers are imagining the kind of initiatives that few on the busy Obama team may have had time to contemplate. Given the doleful state of the economy, many items on those wish lists can be dismissed as, well, wishful. But the officials say they believe that the president-elect, by patterning himself as a Franklin D. Roosevelt-style pump primer, will make some of the projects and cash infusions they desire come to pass.
 Local officials see a future filled with the realization of colossal construction projects that have already been planned, including a new Tappan Zee Bridge; a tunnel under the Hudson River to Penn Station to relieve New Jersey Transit delays; a Nassau hub retail and entertainment cluster around a revamped Nassau Coliseum; and upgraded sewer plants to remove more nitrogen from Long Island Sound. 
 Such projects could spur the economy by providing jobs: 35,000 for every $1 billion spent on infrastructure, according to New Jersey officials. Regional officials also hope for more housing vouchers for the poor, and for block grants to rebuild playgrounds, sidewalks and police forces, money they say was grudgingly dribbled out during the Bush administration.
 They are buoyed that two local stars appear headed to Washington -- both Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was poised last week to be named secretary of state, and Timothy F. Geithner, the nominee for secretary of the Treasury, are Westchester residents. And Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also of Westchester, has been mentioned as possible administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, meanwhile, worries that Lisa P. Jackson, his director of environmental protection, could be leaving for Washington. She is already co-chairwoman of an Obama transition committee. 
 Officials from the region foresee more clout for local politicians who presciently picked Mr. Obama early on.
 ''They're calling me Obama's guy on Long Island,'' said Jon. D. Cooper, a Suffolk County legislator who risked political ostracism early last year by assuming chairmanship of the Obama campaign on Long Island. He said he has referred resumes of several hundred job seekers to the incoming administration. 
 Local officials are also tallying their connections in Washington. United States Representative Steve Israel of Suffolk County sent Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois a dozen Long Island bagels when he was chosen as Mr. Obama's chief of staff.
 ''He criticized me for not including the lox,'' Mr. Israel said.
 Andrew J. Spano, Westchester's county executive, facing a $46 million gap in his proposed budget, which would require a 2.97 percent property tax increase, is more than mindful that he and Mr. Obama share a campaign guru, David Axelrod, the president-elect's chief strategist and now his senior adviser.
 ''In any government, any connection helps because it gets you entree,'' Mr. Spano said.
 Many in the region are looking for the same kind of bold strokes from Mr. Obama that many people in the rest of the country are seeking: a rekindling of the economy, an end to the Iraq war and insurance for millions more against health emergencies.
 ''We had a country that was at peace and in the black, and eight years later we're broke and in two wars and dispirited,'' said Richard L. Brodsky, a Democratic state assemblyman from Westchester. ''This is one of those moments when we ought to be part of a larger polity. We will rise or fall if everybody rises or falls, and our particular pleadings will come second to the larger issues.''
 Yet, there is also anxiety that Mr. Obama's tax policy, which would raise taxes for households earning more than $250,000, would hurt upper-middle-class families. 
 ''When I tell colleagues from Arkansas that $250,000 is not wealthy on Long Island, their jaws drop,'' Mr. Israel said. At least 10 percent of Long Island homes have incomes in excess of that threshold, double the national level, said Martin R. Cantor, director of the Long Island Economic and Social Policy Institute. 
 STILL, regional officials say they have the first chance in eight years to see revisions in the aid formulas that they say shortchange denser urban states. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, all of which are facing formidable budget shortfalls, pay comparatively more in federal taxes because of their wealthier residents. The shortfall in New York alone is pegged at $8.8 billion in the next fiscal year. 
 In Westchester, there has been a virtual freeze in the number of Section 8 housing vouchers the county receives for poor families in struggling neighborhoods like some of those in Yonkers. ''I have a feeling that Obama will be more interested in vouchers,'' Mr. Spano predicted. 
 There has also been a decline in community development block grants, to $5.7 million this year -- the same level as 15 years ago -- from $7 million in 2002, said Norma V. Drummond, Westchester's deputy commissioner of planning. 
 With the end of the Bush era, Representative Nita M. Lowey's position as one of the so-called cardinals -- the 12 subcommittee chairmen or chairwomen on the House Appropriations Committee -- will have more muscle. Ms. Lowey hopes that as in 1993, when, with her help, New York State ended up with an additional $600 million in Medicaid assistance, Congress will provide for another increase in the federal share for New York. 
 ''I've worked closely with Rahm Emanuel,'' she said. ''He's a moderate pragmatist, and that's what describes me.''
 Mr. Brodsky, a former chairman of the Assembly's environmental committee, said he thinks that Mr. Obama will address issues regarding the Indian Point nuclear plant. ''Four billion gallons of water a day go back to the river untreated,'' Mr. Brodsky said of discharges from the plant. ''No other facility in the world gets that pass.'' 
 Martin Rogowsky and Thomas J. Abinanti, both county legislators, cited the need for $250 million in improvements for the four sewage treatment plants on Long Island Sound. 
 ''That would put money into the economy with projects, not make-work projects, we have to do,'' Mr. Abinanti said.
 To some local political observers, one downside of the regional landslide for Mr. Obama is the humbling of the Republican Party as a competitive counterweight to the Democrats. Only three Republican congressmen are left in New York -- one, Peter D. King, remains in the once reliably Republican stronghold of Long Island -- and none in Connecticut. There is not a single Republican state assemblyman or senator left in Westchester, ruled not so long ago by Republicans.
 ''One-party rule is always a disaster,'' Mr. Brodsky said.

HEADLINE: Looking for Obama To Return the Good Will

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER; Gregory B. Hladky contributed reporting from Connecticut, Bruce Lambert from Long Island and Iver Peterson from New Jersey.

 BODY:
BARACK OBAMA's presidential express racked up majorities of more than 60 and 70 percent in a half dozen counties in the region, upending local politics by leaving behind a greatly diminished Republican Party.
 So it should be no surprise that political officials here, particularly emboldened Democrats, are thinking -- hopefully, even hungrily -- about what Mr. Obama's message of change will mean for them. 
 Interviews suggest that local power brokers and policy makers are imagining the kind of initiatives that few on the busy Obama team may have had time to contemplate. Given the doleful state of the economy, many items on those wish lists can be dismissed as, well, wishful. But the officials say they believe that the president-elect, by patterning himself as a Franklin D. Roosevelt-style pump primer, will make some of the projects and cash infusions they desire come to pass.
 Local officials see a future filled with the realization of colossal construction projects that have already been planned, including a new Tappan Zee Bridge; a tunnel under the Hudson River to Penn Station to relieve New Jersey Transit delays; a Nassau hub retail and entertainment cluster around a revamped Nassau Coliseum; and upgraded sewer plants to remove more nitrogen from Long Island Sound. 
 Such projects could spur the economy by providing jobs: 35,000 for every $1 billion spent on infrastructure, New Jersey officials say. Regional officials also hope for more housing vouchers for the poor, and for block grants to rebuild playgrounds, sidewalks and police forces, money they say was grudgingly dribbled out during the Bush administration.
 They are buoyed that two local stars appear headed to Washington -- both Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was poised last week to be named secretary of state, and Timothy F. Geithner, the nominee for secretary of the Treasury, are Westchester residents. And Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also of Westchester, has been mentioned as possible administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, meanwhile, worries that Lisa P. Jackson, his environmental protection director, could go to Washington. She is already co-chairwoman of an Obama transition committee. 
 Officials from the region foresee more clout for local politicians who presciently picked Mr. Obama early on. ''They're calling me Obama's guy on Long Island,'' said Jon D. Cooper, a Suffolk County legislator who risked political ostracism early last year by assuming chairmanship of the Obama campaign on Long Island. He said he has referred resumes of several hundred job seekers to the incoming administration. 
 Local officials are also tallying their connections in Washington. United States Representative Steve Israel of Suffolk County sent Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois a dozen Long Island bagels when he was chosen as Mr. Obama's chief of staff.
 ''He criticized me for not including the lox,'' Mr. Israel said.
 Andrew J. Spano, Westchester's county executive, facing a $46 million gap in his proposed budget, which would require a 2.97 percent property tax increase, is more than mindful that he and Mr. Obama share a campaign guru, David Axelrod, the president-elect's chief strategist and now his senior adviser.
 ''In any government, any connection helps because it gets you entree,'' Mr. Spano said.
 Many in the region are looking for the same kind of bold strokes from Mr. Obama that many people in the rest of the country are seeking: a rekindling of the economy, an end to the Iraq war and insurance for millions more against health emergencies.
 ''We had a country that was at peace and in the black, and eight years later we're broke and in two wars and dispirited,'' said Richard L. Brodsky, a Democratic state assemblyman from Westchester. ''This is one of those moments when we ought to be part of a larger polity. We will rise or fall if everybody rises or falls, and our particular pleadings will come second to the larger issues.''
 Yet, there is anxiety that Mr. Obama's tax policy, which would raise taxes for households earning more than $250,000, would hurt upper-middle-class families. 
 ''When I tell colleagues from Arkansas that $250,000 is not wealthy on Long Island, their jaws drop,'' Mr. Israel said. 
 Still, regional officials say they have the first chance in eight years to see revisions in the aid formulas that they say shortchange denser urban states. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, all of which are facing formidable budget shortfalls, pay comparatively more in federal taxes because of their wealthier residents. The shortfall in New York alone is pegged at $8.8 billion in the next fiscal year. 
 In New Jersey, Governor Corzine had one word for the next president: ''Help!''
 Mr. Corzine, a former investment banker, said in an interview that he hoped Mr. Obama's stimulus package would arrive quickly enough to keep the state and its 566 municipalities from having to make more cuts. The state budget is already $600 million smaller next year than last, and tax receipt forecasts are $400 million behind break-even. 
 ''Frankly, I think that the new administration as well as the old need to work together to do something about this countercyclical behavior piling up in the states,'' Mr. Corzine said. 
 Although last month he urged a stimulus package of $300 billion, equal to 2 percent of the nation's gross domestic product, the governor suggested on Nov. 11 that the figure might no longer be enough. New Jersey has a list of projects it wants to get done, at a cost of $1 billion -- notably $700 million to begin digging the new tunnel under the Hudson. Cities and townships have wish lists for rebuilding roads and bridges, said William G. Dressel Jr., director of the New Jersey State League of Municipalities.
 ''And we need affordable housing, especially for our workers,'' Mr. Dressel said. ''Most of our work force can't even afford to live in the municipalities where their jobs are.''
 He hopes that Mr. Obama will support a version of the Clinton administration program that paid for 90,000 police officers nationwide. As it is, he added, New Jersey communities are finding it harder to find volunteers, particularly for fire departments, which forces up hiring costs. 
 Philip Kirschner, the president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, expressed hope that the new administration would extend health coverage to more people. ''It's a crushing cost that U.S. businesses have that businesses in other countries don't have because their governments take care of it,'' he said.
 To some local political observers, one downside of the regional landslide for Mr. Obama is the humbling of the Republican Party as a competitive counterweight to the Democrats. Only three Republican congressmen are left in New York -- one, Peter D. King, remains in the once reliably Republican stronghold of Long Island -- and none in Connecticut. There is not a single Republican state assemblyman or senator left in Westchester, ruled not so long ago by Republicans.
 ''One-party rule is always a disaster,'' Mr. Brodsky said.

HEADLINE: OPEC, Struggling to Move in Concert, Considers Cutting Output

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

DATELINE: CAIRO 

 BODY:
Faced with plunging oil prices and shrinking revenues, members of the OPEC cartel suggested on Saturday that they might lower production for the third time this year when they meet in Algeria next month. 
 But the group's unwillingness to seek an immediate cut in output even as demand craters in the United States and the world edges into a broad recession reflects the difficulties the cartel is facing in trying to stop prices from falling. 
 At a chaotic news briefing held in a hotel lobby here, OPEC's president, Chakib Khelil, stressed that compliance with previous production cuts was satisfactory. But even as the organization tries to present a unified front, it is facing the incredibly tough task of trying to stop prices from falling at a time when demand is no longer growing.
 After six years of rising prices and little tension within the group, members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries are growing distrustful of one another's pledges to trim production. As a result, OPEC has proved ineffective at slowing the slide in prices, let alone reversing it. 
 After reaching a historic high in July, oil has lost $90 a barrel, to about $55, as economic growth suddenly slowed in recent months and the financial system seized up.
 At their last two meetings in recent months, OPEC members pledged to withdraw two million barrels a day from the market. It is inevitable that OPEC will have to reduce its production more in coming months, analysts said.
 Saudi Arabia's oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said the group would ''do what needs to be done'' to shore up prices. 
 Mr. Naimi also said that $75 a barrel was a ''fair price,'' echoing comments made by King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia in an interview with Al-Seyassah, a Kuwaiti newspaper, that was published the same day. It is the first time in years that Saudi officials have talked about a specific price.
 Oil prices gained 9 percent last week, after rebounding from three-year lows, as markets anticipated that OPEC would cut its production on Saturday. They were unchanged in thin trading on Friday in New York at $54.43 a barrel but could slip back below $50 again next week.
 OPEC does not publish production figures from its members, so countries have to rely on so-called secondary sources, which include estimates by oil consultants and monthly figures published by the International Energy Agency.
 Some producers believe that Iran and Venezuela, which have been the most vocal in calling for new production cuts to shore up prices, are not carrying enough of the burden. Others, like Angola, see little upside to reducing their own output while they seek to attract new investors. Some, like Saudi Arabia, do not want to lose both market share and revenue while others benefit from their production cuts.
 At the same time, OPEC producers are desperate to stem the slide. Most producers need prices of $60 to $90 a barrel to balance their budgets.

HEADLINE: Going on the Offensive Nov. 23-29

 BODY:
THE NEWS Federal regulators announced a plan to shore up the teetering financial giant Citigroup, with the government investing about $20 billion directly and guaranteeing $306 billion in loans and securities on Citigroup's balance sheet. The company effectively suspended its dividend for three years and agreed to limit executives' pay. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Reports of the plan halted a punishing run on the stock of Citigroup, a company considered too big and central to the financial system to be allowed to fail. The next day, regulators announced $800 billion in new lending programs meant to ease credit strains on other banks and consumers and to push down mortgage rates. 
 THE NEWS President-elect Barack Obama announced his choices for key economic posts in his administration: Timothy F. Geithner for Treasury secretary: Peter R. Orszag for budget director; and Christina D. Romer, Lawrence H. Summers, Paul Volcker and Austan Goolsbee in leading advisory roles. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS The choice of old Washington hands like Mr. Summers and Mr. Volcker, and especially Mr. Geithner, a top Fed official already in the thick of credit-crisis policymaking, drew questions about whether Mr. Obama had set aside his calls for change and fresh thinking. Mr. Obama said he needed aides who knew the ropes and could be effective immediately. 
 THE NEWS New figures showed demand contracting across the economy. Personal spending declined 1 percent in October, the most since the aftermath of the Sept. 2001 terror attacks, even though incomes were up slightly. Orders for durable goods fell sharply. And sales and prices of new homes slumped again in most of the country.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Though overheated spending and borrowing helped create the crisis, economists worried about Keynes's ''paradox of thrift'': the natural instinct to spend less and save more in hard times may make those times harder by starving the economy of the demand for goods and services that it needs to recover.
 THE NEWS Governments around the world sought to stimulate economic activity: China cut its benchmark one-year interest rates by more than a percentage point, the fourth and steepest cut in 10 weeks. British officials proposed $30 billion in tax cuts and new spending. And the European Union issued a list of proposed spending measures by the union and its 27 governments totaling about $260 billion.
 BEHIND THE NEWS Political momentum continued to build for stimulus measures in the United States as well, but it was unclear whether agreement could be reached to enact a substantial package before the new administration and Congress take office in January.
 THE NEWS Investors bid stocks upward through the week, with the broad-based S.& P. 500 index rising 11.9 percent and the Dow industrials gaining 782 points, or about 9 percent. 
 BEHIND THE NEWS Perhaps investors were reassured by Mr. Obama's cabinet choices, sighing in relief at the reprieve for Citigroup and the apparent progress in shoring up the banking system, or simply concluding that the panic selling of recent weeks had overshot the mark. Whatever the reason, or reasons, investors seemed to have regained a bit of confidence, shrugging off the economic slowdown and perhaps anticipating that things will get better in the months to come, analysts said.

HEADLINE: Delegating To the Center

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE B. LINDSEY. 
Lawrence B. Lindsey, the director of the National Economic Council from 2001 to 2002, is the author of ''What a President Should Know ... but Most Learn Too Late.''

DATELINE: Fairfax, Va. 

 BODY:
 BARACK OBAMA faces the most difficult job transition anyone will ever face: moving from campaigning to governing as president of the United States. For the past two years, Mr. Obama wanted something from every person he met -- money, help, votes. He made many promises, appropriately vague, in the process. Now everyone wants something from him -- a job, a policy decision, a good word or reference, and, most of all, for him to deliver on what they think he promised, which may be quite different from what he actually said. 
 To handle this, presidents establish a process to adjudicate their campaign promises in light of the realities of governing. Some Democrats have complained that nearly all of Mr. Obama's appointments are part of the Washington establishment, hardly symbols of change. Mr. Obama's organization responds that even though this is true, it will be the president who makes the decisions. 
 This is technically true. But the operational realities of governing mean that nearly all of the information, people and ideas that Mr. Obama will be exposed to will be determined by someone else. 
 The announcement on Monday of the new economic team indicated that Mr. Obama intends to delegate a good deal of economic policy. He selected individuals with strong technical backgrounds who have careers that are quite independent of the president-elect. In challenging times that require expertise this is probably wise, but history also suggests that this might create management challenges for the president down the road. 
 The primary missions of the new administration will be an extension of what the current administration is doing, albeit on a grander scale. First, rescuing the banking system from the excesses of 15 years of unparalleled credit expansion will involve an extension and evolution of the Treasury's current program, with which Timothy Geithner, Mr. Obama's nominee for Treasury secretary, has been intimately involved. 
 Second, the administration will doubtless introduce a stimulus plan far more expansive than what Mr. Obama discussed in October as a candidate. These, plus an accommodative monetary policy from the Federal Reserve, will be the cornerstones of macroeconomic policy.
 But there are a variety of microeconomic policies on which Mr. Obama ran that will also require attention. One is an expansion of the federal role in health care. This, however, is not really an effective economic stimulus because it moves resources into an area that already has excess demand and rising prices, not into the weak areas of the economy. At some point, perhaps a year or two from now, health-care reform might place strains on the federal budget and push up interest rates, weakening the recovery.
 Then there is industrial policy, particularly with regard to the automakers. The short-run decision is fairly clear: help for the companies is essential if we are going to maintain their industrial infrastructure. But many in Congress want to make a ''greening'' of the car industry a priority, and blocked a bipartisan rescue plan for the industry on these grounds. 
 While they may choose not to get involved in this fight, Mr. Obama's advisers are well enough steeped in economic reality to understand that the survival of the industry is the immediate priority, not new green regulations.
 Finally, there is the labor-union agenda, which shifts power away from markets and individual workers and toward those who head organized labor. The president-elect's advisers know that this will make the economy less competitive and delay recovery, and organized labor even denounced a shift toward advisers like these earlier in the campaign. But Mr. Obama owes a lot to the unions.
 Mr. Obama's key economic appointees come from the center-left, which means their instincts will conflict with Mr. Obama's promises to key Democratic Party constituencies. Larry Summers has a distinguished academic career, as does Christina Romer, who as an economic historian will bring a much-needed perspective to the Council of Economic Advisers. Mr. Geithner was a Summers protege at the Clinton Treasury, and Peter Orszag has a strong constituency on Capitol Hill after managing the Congressional Budget Office. 
 Formal economic decision-making is in the hands of Mr. Summers, with Mr. Geithner as key executor of policy. Early on, expect this process to go on unobstructed. Things will change late in 2009. Mr. Obama's political honeymoon will be over. The base will be getting restive. Most important, if the rumors are true, Mr. Summers will be focused on a transition to the Federal Reserve. The policy process that the president-elect has set up will then be tested. 
 For those interested in high political theater, it will be a fascinating time. For those with a policy bent, it will be the moment when the country learns whether Mr. Obama plans to govern from the center-left, or move further toward the left -- the place where his primary candidacy originated.

HEADLINE: Bloomberg Team Pressed Hard for Use of Luxury Suite at Yankee Stadium

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration was so intent on obtaining a free luxury suite for its own use at the new Yankee Stadium, newly released e-mail messages show, that the mayor's aides pushed for a larger suite and free food, and eventually gave the Yankees 250 additional parking spaces in exchange.
 The parking spaces were given to the team for the private use of Yankees officials, players and others; the spaces were originally planned for public parking. The city also turned over the rights to three new billboards along the Major Deegan Expressway, and whatever revenue they generate, as part of the deal.
 The e-mail messages between the aides to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Yankees executives were obtained and released by Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, Democrat of Westchester, who questions whether taxpayers were adequately protected in the city's deal with the team. 
 Mr. Brodsky said what emerges from the e-mail correspondence is a sense of entitlement ingrained in Bloomberg officials. He said that the city appeared to be pushing for use of the suite for not just regular-season games, but for the playoffs and the World Series, and for special events like concerts, too.
 ''There's this 'Alice in Wonderland' quality to the question of, what is the public interest here and who's protecting it?'' said Mr. Brodsky, who conducted a hearing on the issue of public financing of sports stadiums this summer. ''We can't find the money for the M.T.A., or schools, or hospitals, and these folks are used to the perks and good things of life, and expect them.''
 The city maintains it was simply trying to obtain a luxury suite comparable to that given to other cities involved in stadium or arena projects. But the message traffic, which dates to January 2006, raises questions, too, about how sincere city officials were when they recently stated publicly that the box could be used to reward outstanding city workers, rather than mainly for the mayor, dignitaries and aides. The notion of inviting city workers as guests is not mentioned in the e-mail messages until Aug. 7, 2008, and only then in response to an inquiry from a reporter.
 The city's push for the perks has been known, at least broadly speaking, since Mr. Brodsky began raising questions earlier this year about the stadium deals for the Yankees and Mets, from whom the city also secured a luxury box. But the e-mail messages offer a revealing snapshot of the behavior and marching orders of the people involved in the deal for the construction of the billion-dollar Yankee Stadium.
 It is hard to determine the precise value of what the city gave the Yankees as part of the exchange. The public parking, though perhaps a convenience to those who drive to the stadium, was to be run by a parking garage operator, not the city, before it was turned over to the Yankees for team use. The billboards would most likely generate about $750,000 annually, given their location. The Yankees are expected to charge $600,000 to $850,000 a year for stadium luxury suites, according to reports.
 The project required permission from the Internal Revenue Service because of the team's desire to use tax-exempt bonds to finance construction. In one heated exchange, city lawyers threatened they would not make the request to the I.R.S. for the use of the tax-exempt financing unless the Yankees would consider providing the luxury suite.
 Lonn Trust, the Yankees chief operating officer, wrote to the city on Jan. 26, 2006: ''For clarity, no seats, no suites, no tickets, and as they say in Brooklyn 'No nothin'.' '' 
 In response, a lawyer for the city, Joseph Gunn, warned that ''No nothin' can go both ways,'' adding that if the luxury suite was not included, ''We do not submit the letter ruling request.''
 ''Suite negotiations between the city and the New York Yankees were part of lengthy discussions with the city involving a whole host of different deal points,'' said Alice McGillion, a spokeswoman for the Yankees. 
 At another point, raw personal feelings emerged, as evidenced during this exchange, starting June 29, 2006, between top city officials about Randy Levine, the Yankees president.
 ''If we want a deal on the suite, he wants 250 spaces,'' Seth W. Pinsky, then the executive vice president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, wrote to Daniel L. Doctoroff, a former deputy mayor. After Mr. Doctoroff did not respond, Mr. Pinsky, a bit sheepishly, wrote the next day: ''It comes down to how much we're willing to rely on Randy's word.''
 ''Let's not give,'' Mr. Doctoroff replied. ''I don't trust him.''
 Another theme that emerges is Mr. Bloomberg's interest in the stadiums. In one e-mail message on July 5, 2006, about the Mets' new stadium, Mr. Pinsky noted: ''This is a big issue to the mayor.''
 David Lombino, a spokesman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, cautioned against reading too much into the e-mail messages.
 ''Securing the option to use a box at the stadium was one part of a much larger, comprehensive negotiation where we sought the best deal possible for the city,'' he said. ''Our goal was to make sure that New York had the same advantages as other cities, including the option to use a box, be it for staff outings, for public employees or for visiting dignitaries. The mayor's office has indicated that no decision has been made as to whether or not it will exercise the option, but it exists for this and future administrations.''
 A Bloomberg spokesman, Andrew Brent, echoed those ideas, saying, ''As a matter of equity, it was important to us throughout the negotiations that the Yankees were not exempted from such gives or treated any differently than other teams.''
 In response to recent questions from reporters, Mr. Pinsky, who is now the president of the Economic Development Corporation, has played down the importance of the luxury suite, saying he did not understand what all the fuss was about.
 But the messages show that he and other aides were anything but casual about the matter, with issues like the location and size of the box of obvious concern. 
 When the team agreed to an 8-seat box, the city successfully demanded 12 seats. 
 And on July 7, 2006, Mr. Pinsky informed Mr. Doctoroff that the Yankees had told him: ''The location of the box is in left field, but before the foul pole. Also, it is designed to project out, so that it will have a direct view down the third base line.''
 The city also demanded that the luxury suite be provided with food -- just like all the other suites. But the Yankees balked.
 In one message dated July 26, 2006, Stephen Lefkowitz, a Yankees lawyer, wrote to Mr. Pinsky: ''Seth -- Randy believes he told you 'no food' and that you agreed. If this is so, please let me know and we can drop this from our list of irritants.''
 The city, of course, disagreed. And that prompted Mr. Lefkowitz to respond this way: ''It's really ridiculous, but it sticks like a bone in everyone's craw. The Yankees feel the city should pay for any food it wants to consume, and I think it's a little unseemly to require 'free' food.''
 He added: ''For this I went to law school -- sigh.''

HEADLINE: Clinton to Name Donors as Part Of Obama Deal

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
Former President Bill Clinton has agreed to disclose publicly the names of more than 200,000 donors to his foundation as part of an accord with President-elect Barack Obama that clears the way for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton to become secretary of state, Democrats close to both sides said on Saturday.
 Mr. Clinton has kept his contributor list secret, as permitted under federal law, but he decided to publish it to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest with Mrs. Clinton's duties as the nation's top diplomat, said the Democrats, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the agreement with Mr. Obama's team. Mr. Obama plans to announce Mrs. Clinton's nomination on Monday, according to advisers. 
 The disclosure of contributors is among nine conditions that Mr. Clinton signed off on during discussions with representatives of Mr. Obama; all go beyond the requirements of law. Among other issues, he agreed to incorporate his Clinton Global Initiative separately from his foundation so that he has less direct involvement. The initiative, which promotes efforts to fight disease, poverty and climate change, would no longer hold annual meetings outside of the United States or accept new contributions from foreign governments.
 Mr. Clinton also agreed to submit his future personal speeches and business activities for review by State Department ethics officials and, if necessary, by the White House counsel's office.
 The former president's web of business and charitable activities raised questions about how he could continue to travel the world soliciting multimillion-dollar contributions for his foundation and collecting six-figure speaking fees for himself from foreign organizations and individuals while his wife conducted American foreign policy. 
 Lawyers for Mr. Clinton and Mr. Obama spent days crafting the agreement in hopes of addressing any concerns about Mr. Clinton's activities. He had previously said he would do whatever the Obama transition team asked in order to make it possible for his wife to serve without questions. Mr. Obama's team said it was satisfied that the concessions Mr. Clinton made should defuse any potential controversy. Until Saturday, only some elements of the agreement had become public.
 Neither Mr. Obama's office nor Mr. Clinton's office would comment. The disclosure of Mr. Clinton's full agreement on a Saturday night might have the effect of drawing less attention to it while keeping the focus Monday on Mrs. Clinton. Her nomination will be announced along with the retention of Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates and the appointment of Gen. James L. Jones, a retired Marine commandant, as national security adviser.
 In the eight years since he left the White House, Mr. Clinton has built a new life as a businessman and international philanthropist, which has made him rich while he helped fight AIDS, malaria, malnutrition and other maladies around the world. Since its formation a decade ago, the William J. Clinton Foundation has raised more than $500 million to build a presidential library and to finance charitable programs.
 Mr. Clinton has never revealed his contributors, but among those whose identities have become known over the years are the Saudi royal family, the king of Morocco, a foundation linked to the United Arab Emirates, the governments of Kuwait and Qatar and a tycoon who is the son-in-law of Ukraine's former authoritarian president.
 For his speeches, Mr. Clinton could command as much as $425,000 for one hour, often paid by foreign companies or individuals who might have an interest in American foreign policy. He gave at least 54 such speeches last year for a total of $10.1 million. Even as his wife was first approached by Mr. Obama about the State Department job this month, the former president was heading to Kuwait to speak at an economic symposium sponsored by the National Bank of Kuwait.
 To eliminate any concerns, Mr. Clinton turned over to Mr. Obama's team the names of all 208,000 individuals and organizations that have given money since 1997. The agreement will ensure that the foundation releases the names to the public as well by the end of December. The names will be divided into categories giving the general level of contributions rather than the precise dollar amount. Any future donors will be disclosed as long as Mrs. Clinton is in the cabinet.
 The Clinton Global Initiative, now part of the foundation, will be incorporated separately to establish some distance from the former president in its day-to-day activities. Mr. Clinton will continue to host gatherings of the initiative and invite participants who pay registration fees, but will not solicit sponsorships, according to the agreement.
 The agreement, most of which will become effective once Mrs. Clinton is confirmed, will prevent the Clinton Global Initiative from holding just the sort of meeting that it is sponsoring in Hong Kong starting Tuesday, the day after Mr. Obama's scheduled announcement. The meeting was scheduled to be the first of a series around the world bringing together leaders of government, business and nonprofit groups to discuss education, energy, climate change and public health.
 Four other initiatives under the umbrella of the Clinton foundation -- focused on H.I.V./AIDS, climate change, development and sustainable growth -- will continue to do work under agreements with foreign governments that provide financing, including Britain, France, Norway and Sweden. But if any of those countries increases its commitment or a new country decides to contribute, the foundation will notify State Department ethics officials.

HEADLINE: Echoes of the Past, But Some Cause For Hope

BYLINE: By BEN STEIN. 
Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist. E-mail: ebiz@nytimes.com

 BODY:
I WATCHED with a sense of both satisfaction and foreboding as President-elect Barack Obama introduced his economics and finance team last week. 
 First, I am the world's most ardent fan of Paul A. Volcker and Lawrence Summers, but I am a bit puzzled by the choice of Timothy F. Geithner to be Treasury secretary. During the presidential campaign, I heard Mr. Obama talk many times about ''change you can believe in.'' But what does Mr. Geithner have to do with change?
 He's the pre-eminent careerist of old-time finance, and a basic part of the team that got us into this mess. He was pro-deregulation for most of his career. He went along with failing to rescue Lehman Brothers, a decision now generally considered a catastrophic mistake. He led the Federal Reserve Bank of New York while money-center banks made lethal mistakes of faulty risk management -- and he did zero to stop it, as far as is known. 
 In what sense is he ''change you can believe in''? How is he part of the solution, not part of the problem? I know he is a protege of Robert E. Rubin. But isn't Mr. Rubin himself the essence of the Washington-New York finance axis of power? He was a fine Treasury secretary while the tech boom made all things new, but Citigroup hasn't exactly thrived during his tenure. Again, where is the change?
 It's not just Mr. Obama's personnel choices that bear watching, but what he's said about his economic programs. Public works seem to be the centerpiece of his effort to jolt the economy back into high gear. But recall the history of national attempts to ''jolt'' economies this way. In a word, their success is limited. 
 New Deal programs like the Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps were highly visible but accomplished little on a macro scale. Yes, they employed hundreds of thousands, and that was great. They built post offices and bridges. But they created friction with unions because they paid sub-union wages. 
 Will the new administration be prepared to require that public works employees be union members? If so, of what union?
 No matter how this is handled, someone will be unhappy. It will cost some real money if they are union members, and will cause some anger if they aren't. Business won't like it if wages rise in an area where it has flourished with low-wage workers.
 But the main thing is that public works, except on a truly gigantic scale, don't really work to jump-start the economy. The strategy didn't work in Japan during the ''lost decade'' of the 1990s. It didn't work here during the Depression. Unemployment was still high on the eve of Pearl Harbor and the United States' entry into World War II.
 Many capable economists believe that by causing wage and price rigidity, the New Deal actually prolonged the Depression. I'm not sure this holds water, but causes have many effects, not all welcome.
 Again, though, if public works are to succeed, they have to be of world-war-rearmament size if there is a real depression. It took an enormous increase in federal spending as we entered the war to move us to full employment.
 Obviously, we are not in anything like the Great Depression. But even in smaller recessions, there is no clear evidence that public works -- while they may be desirable in and of themselves -- can get us to anything resembling full employment.
 And how will that public works money be spent? There is little indication that spending more on school buildings creates better-educated students. I offer the beloved District of Columbia as an example: superhigh spending, superpoor results. 
 Next, I note with much alarm Mr. Obama's intention to make cuts in government spending. Based on comments over his career, I suspect these might be in the military. It's important to weigh how dangerous a world we live in before reducing funds for an already inadequate military.
 But also note that in a depressed economy, the last thing we need are spending cuts anywhere, except where there is fraud, waste or abuse -- those familiar campaign-trail demons. In bad times, we want large deficits and lots of government spending.
 To read the budget's every line for possible cuts is, first, impossible for one man (the budget has a lot of lines) and, second, a waste of a leader's time. One president who pored over the budget line by line, Jimmy Carter, had results the country might not want to repeat.
 On the positive side, Mr. Obama will have some fine economists on his staff, including Mr. Summers, the powerful Mr. Volcker and Christina D. Romer of the University of California, Berkeley. They can help figure out what works and what is fantasy. Already, their waiting in the wings is jolting the current administration's team into a giant-sized monetary stimulus. This will be of enormous impact and is long overdue. It is a relief that we will have a team, the Obama team, that has a plan and will get something done, and is goading Henry Paulson and Ben Bernanke into action.
 Mr. Obama's own experience is limited, but with a team like this, by and large, I have hope.

HEADLINE: Expert Opinions, From Neutral Observers

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT

 BODY:
THE debate about bailing out Detroit has been impassioned in The Times. On the Op-Ed page, Mitt Romney argued that if Detroit gets what it wants, ''you can kiss the American automobile industry goodbye.'' Spencer Abraham, a former senator from Michigan, wrote that Romney's preferred course, a ''managed bankruptcy,'' would doom the automakers.
 The newspaper took its own stand in an editorial, declaring that a failure to provide an infusion of taxpayer money ''would be a truly irresponsible act.''
 Those were robust opinions, on the pages meant for them. But the reporters and columnists covering the economic crisis for The Times's business news department have their own opinions, and they have not been shy about declaring them in columns on the news pages, raising again the question of how much people who report the news should also tell you what they think about it. 
 On Nov. 18, a column by Andrew Ross Sorkin, arguing for a government-sponsored bankruptcy, said, ''Taxpayers shouldn't fork over a cent'' to save General Motors ''until shareholders are wiped out, management is tossed out and the industry is completely reorganized.''
 His colleague, Joe Nocera, came down on the other side on Nov. 22. Maybe G.M. needs ''the harsh slap of bankruptcy'' to force it to change, he said. ''But let's not go down that road until there truly is no other choice. We're not there yet.''
 Sorkin's column, with its blunt tone, led to a spirited discussion in the newsroom. Craig Whitney, the standards editor, flagged it to Bill Keller, the executive editor. Keller said the column's analysis was fine, but it ''stepped over the line'' by calling for G.M.'s chief executive to be fired. Keller called a meeting of business editors and columnists last Monday to revisit a continuing debate about guidelines for columns on news pages.
 ''Subtlety and restraint are important in news columns,'' he told me. Business columnists must build a case through reporting that can lead a reader to a conclusion, Keller said. Op-Ed columnists have ''greater license to write from an ideological viewpoint and be prescriptive.''
 Sorkin said his column was ''impactful.'' He got a lot of positive reader feedback, and the column was read by lawmakers in Washington, he said. Sorkin, who as a reporter covers mergers and acquisitions, said he thinks carefully about the differing roles of news reporter and columnist and believes that readers understand the distinction. He felt he had no conflict in this case because he had not written a news article about the auto industry for more than a month.
 Keller, Whitney and Larry Ingrassia, the business editor, all made the case that readers of the business pages want more than the daily news, especially when it involves such complex subjects. ''They want to know what it means and what we make of it,'' Ingrassia said.
 Nocera said there are decades of experience among the business news columnists. ''At this moment of crisis, we would be doing our readers a huge disservice not to give them the benefit of that wisdom,'' he said. ''I think it is imperative that we offer our opinions and offer them clearly, and without using the wiggle words.'' Nocera is a full-time columnist (though he has written a couple of news articles in the current crisis), so his situation is arguably different from those of Sorkin, Gretchen Morgenson, Floyd Norris and others who regularly write both news and columns.
 Last month, Morgenson covered Congressional hearings on the role that credit rating agencies played in the financial crisis. Former officials of two agencies testified that conflicts of interest caused the companies to fail investors. Current company executives denied it. Morgenson's report gave both sides. Three days later, she wrote a column that said the testimony of one executive ''was a lot for my malarkey meter to absorb.''
 When I asked Morgenson why it was O.K. to write a straight news article about the hearings and then give her personal opinion about them in a column, she said, ''I do not pull my opinions out of thin air.'' In this case, internal e-mail and documents did seem to contradict much of what the rating executives said, which the news article and column pointed out. ''I think it would be unfortunate indeed if staffers who can both report news stories fairly and write columns that are well-argued are forced to do one or the other but not both,'' Morgenson said.
 Keller defended having Morgenson cover the hearings and then write a column about them. ''I don't think it would have confused readers in the slightest,'' he said. ''She's remarkably adept at doing both.'' Keller and Whitney said there was agreement at the meeting last Monday that a reporter should not write a news story and a column about that story on the same day and page.
 Last April, I wrote about what I thought was the blurring of the line between news and opinion in The Times. Keller told me then that the mandate of news columnists ''is fundamentally analytical.'' He said they may have a point of view based on a body of reporting but ''they don't prescribe outcomes.''
 It seems to me that, while The Times has covered the financial and economic crises with great distinction, explaining events with depth and clarity, editors have also let that line between news and opinion slip. Sorkin's column crossed the line and became prescriptive, as Keller said, but I think Nocera's did too. And if it isn't all right to have a reporter write a column about a news article he or she is covering on the same day, why is it all right three days later?
 Times editors acknowledge that there is a risk to the paper's credibility if they don't manage the mix of news and opinion properly, but they say the payoff from having the expert comments of their journalists is worth the risk. It is true that no reader has complained to me about bias on the business pages, but the single biggest complaint I get is that The Times is, in the broadest sense, a biased newspaper. As business issues, public policy and politics merge in the current crisis, I think the risk only increases as reporters and news columnists slide from analysis to outright opinion.
 The editors said they would be refining the guidelines for columnists. In my perfect world, I would draw them conservatively, pulling back from first-person opinion. I would not have reporters writing opinion about the subjects they cover. But that battle appears lost to two stronger influences: the Internet, which puts a premium on opinion and voice, and economics, which keeps the business staff from having columnists who don't also carry reporting duty.
 ''We don't have the resources to do that,'' Ingrassia said.

HEADLINE: Looking for Obama To Return the Good Will

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER; Gregory B. Hladky contributed reporting from Connecticut, Bruce Lambert from Long Island and Iver Peterson from New Jersey.

 BODY:
BARACK OBAMA's presidential express racked up majorities of more than 60 and 70 percent in a half dozen counties in the region, upending local politics by leaving behind a greatly diminished Republican Party.
 So it should be no surprise that political officials here, particularly emboldened Democrats, are thinking -- hopefully, even hungrily -- about what Mr. Obama's message of change will mean for them. 
 Interviews suggest that local power brokers and policy makers are imagining the kind of initiatives that few on the busy Obama team may have had time to contemplate. Given the doleful state of the economy, many items on those wish lists can be dismissed as, well, wishful. But the officials say they believe that the president-elect, by patterning himself as a Franklin D. Roosevelt-style pump primer, will make some of the projects and cash infusions they desire come to pass. 
 Local officials see a future filled with the realization of colossal construction projects that have already been planned, including a new Tappan Zee Bridge; a tunnel under the Hudson River to Penn Station to relieve New Jersey Transit delays; a Nassau hub retail and entertainment cluster around a revamped Nassau Coliseum; and upgraded sewer plants to remove more nitrogen from Long Island Sound. 
 Such projects could spur the economy by providing jobs: 35,000 for every $1 billion spent on infrastructure, according to New Jersey officials. Regional officials also hope for more housing vouchers for the poor, and for block grants to rebuild playgrounds, sidewalks and police forces, money they say was grudgingly dribbled out during the Bush administration.
 They are buoyed that two local stars appear headed to Washington -- both Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was poised last week to be named secretary of state, and Timothy F. Geithner, the nominee for secretary of the Treasury, are Westchester residents. And Robert F. Kennedy Jr., also of Westchester, has been mentioned as possible administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Gov. Jon S. Corzine of New Jersey, meanwhile, worries that Lisa P. Jackson, his director of environmental protection, could be leaving for Washington. She is already co-chairwoman of an Obama transition committee. 
 Officials in the region foresee more clout for local politicians who presciently picked Mr. Obama early on. 
 ''They're calling me Obama's guy on Long Island,'' said Jon. D. Cooper, a Suffolk legislator who risked political ostracism early last year by assuming chairmanship of the Obama campaign on Long Island. He said he has referred resumes of several hundred job seekers to the incoming administration. 
 Local officials are also tallying their connections in Washington. United States Representative Steve Israel of Suffolk County sent Representative Rahm Emanuel of Illinois a dozen Long Island bagels when he was chosen as Mr. Obama's chief of staff.
 ''He criticized me for not including the lox,'' Mr. Israel said.
 Andrew J. Spano, Westchester's county executive, facing a $46 million gap in his proposed budget, which would require a 2.97 percent property tax increase, is more than mindful that he and Mr. Obama share a campaign guru, David Axelrod, the president-elect's chief strategist and now his senior adviser.
 ''In any government, any connection helps because it gets you entree,'' Mr. Spano said.
 Many in the region are looking for the same kind of bold strokes from Mr. Obama that many people in the rest of the country are seeking: a rekindling of the economy, an end to the Iraq war and insurance for millions more against health emergencies.
 ''We had a country that was at peace and in the black, and eight years later we're broke and in two wars and dispirited,'' said Richard L. Brodsky, a Democratic state assemblyman from Westchester. ''This is one of those moments when we ought to be part of a larger polity. We will rise or fall if everybody rises or falls, and our particular pleadings will come second to the larger issues.''
 Yet there is anxiety that Mr. Obama's tax policy, which would raise taxes for households earning more than $250,000, would hurt upper-middle-class families. 
 ''When I tell colleagues from Arkansas that $250,000 is not wealthy on Long Island, their jaws drop,'' Mr. Israel said. At least 10 percent of Long Island homes have incomes in excess of that threshold, double the national level, said Martin R. Cantor, director of the Long Island Economic and Social Policy Institute. 
 Still, regional officials say they have the first chance in eight years to see revisions in the aid formulas that they say shortchange denser urban states. New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, all of which are facing formidable budget shortfalls, pay comparatively more in federal taxes because of their wealthier residents. The shortfall in New York alone is pegged at $8.8 billion in the next fiscal year. 
 In Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general, looks forward to tougher policing of the environment and the drug industry. He has tried to stop a $700 million floating liquefied natural gas platform on the Sound that received preliminary federal approval. And he has accused the United States Food and Drug Administration of being ''asleep at the switch'' in monitoring tainted drugs from China as well as harmful drugs here. 
 Martin M. Looney, a New Haven Democrat who is the State Senate majority leader, said that Mr. Obama's experience as a state legislator would help Connecticut because ''he understands how states operate, how state legislators operate.'' Mr. Looney said he hoped that health care reform would not only help uninsured residents, but also inject more federal cash into the state's Medicaid program.
 Connecticut has at least one hook in the Obama camp: Daniel C. Esty, director of the Yale Center for Environmental Law and Policy, who was a campaign adviser. He has been mentioned as a possible Obama appointee.
 To some local political observers, one downside of the regional landslide for Mr. Obama is the humbling of the Republican Party as a competitive counterweight to the Democrats. Only three Republican congressmen are left in New York -- one, Peter D. King, remains in the once reliably Republican stronghold of Long Island -- and none in Connecticut. There is not a single Republican state assemblyman or senator left in Westchester, ruled not so long ago by Republicans.
 ''One-party rule is always a disaster,'' Mr. Brodsky said.

HEADLINE: A $1 Trillion Answer

BYLINE: By JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ. 
Joseph E. Stiglitz, a professor of economics at Columbia who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers from 1995 to 1997 and was awarded the Nobel prize in economics in 2001, is the author, with Linda J. Bilmes, of ''The Three Trillion Dollar War.''

 BODY:
WHAT President-elect Barack Obama will need to do is horribly complicated but also very clear. 
 First, he must stop the economy from going deeper into recession. Then he needs to bring about a robust recovery, preferably in ways that support the long-term needs of the United States: by repairing our neglected public works, invigorating our technological leadership, making our society greener, fixing our health care problems, healing our social and economic divide, and restoring our social compact. 
 It will not be easy. President Bush's legacy of debtand the opposition of those who benefit from the status quo present major obstacles. 
 There is an emerging consensus among economists that a big -- very big -- stimulus is needed, at least $600 billion to $1 trillion over two years. Mr. Obama's announced goal of 2.5 million new jobs by 2011 is too modest. In the next two years, almost four million workers will enter the labor force -- or would if there were jobs. Combined with the loss of employment this year, that means we should be striving to create more than five million jobs.
 A large stimulus package can always be trimmed later if it's not needed because the economy returns to health faster than most economists think. But we need to plan for what looks to be a deep and long downturn. By relying heavily on automatic stabilizers -- expenditures like increased unemployment benefits and revenue sharing with states -- we can dose out the medicine as needed. The deeper and longer the downturn, the greater the spending. 
 Faint measures would be foolhardy. A weaker economy will suffer lower tax revenues, more foreclosures and more bankruptcies. Once a firm is bankrupt, you can't unbankrupt it by providing a stronger stimulus later on. 
 There are other elementary principles that help guide the design of a good stimulus. The government could, for instance, temporarily pay (through a tax credit) part of the cost of new private investment for companies that are spending more than, say, 80 percent of what they have spent annually in recent years on equipment like computers and machinery. This would be a high-powered, low-cost stimulus.
 Latter-day Hooverites will say the soaring deficit and national debt mean we cannot afford a large stimulus package. Although today they are receiving billions of dollars in aid, once they have their money some from the financial sector will argue that the economy won't recover unless confidence is restored, and that confidence won't be restored until the deficit narrows. 
 But it's impossible to restore confidence when the economy is in shambles. When millions of Americans are out of work and hundreds of thousands of businesses are going into bankruptcy, there will be no ''confidence.'' This is the reality. To avoid this, we need a big stimulus. 
 But what you do with the money counts, too. The money needs to be spent carefully to ensure that every dollar provides as much stimulus now as possible while also contributing to long-term growth. That is why it is imperative to restructure the Troubled Asset Relief Program. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson has already given away close to half of the $700 billion on very generous terms and without adequate restrictions on the use of the money. 
 The intent of the program was not just to give money to banks but to get them to increase lending. It has not worked, so it needs to be changed. If taxpayers pour our hard-earned money into banks, then the banks should not be allowed to pour out the money as dividends to their shareholders or bonuses to their executives. Nor should they be allowed to use the cash to purchase healthy banks, in further efforts to become ''too big to fail.''
 The Obama administration should not treat Mr. Paulson's plan as immutable simply because ''a deal is a deal.'' The banks knew there was a quid pro quo. Besides, the terms of the relationship between the banks and the government (including the Federal Reserve) have repeatedly been adjusted, though almost always in favor of financial companies. The Fed used to accept only Treasury bills as collateral when it lent to banks. Now it accepts risky assets -- junk. 
 Americans are rightly afraid of losing their jobs, and with that, their health insurance and their homes. We need to provide health insurance to the unemployed and to the uninsured, and we need to do it quickly, possibly through an expanded and more efficient Medicare. 
 We also need to stem the flood of foreclosures. If we help poorer homeowners, banks will benefit, too, as foreclosures are reduced. Through tax deductions, the federal government pays as much as 50 percent of the mortgage costs of upper-income Americans. If we treated the poor just as well as we treated the rich, more would find housing affordable. 
 And we need to change the bankruptcy laws to help homeowners. We have expedited bankruptcy for businesses, to keep them going when they run into financial problems. We should do the same for homeowners. It does no one any good to force poor and middle-income Americans out of their homes. Vacant houses blight neighborhoods. An expedited bankruptcy law would allow the restructuring of the mortgages of millions of Americans who owe more than their houses are worth.
 Deregulation and the failure to adopt regulations to cover risky new financial products have contributed much to the current mess. So far, we have merely given banks more money to spend recklessly. We have done little to change the banks' incentives or constraints.
 Confidence is important, but it will not be restored if the economy is weak, or if Americans think the system is stacked against them. If the asset program is not changed and if regulations are not imposed to change the behavior of those who got us into this situation -- who enriched themselves at the expense of their shareholders -- then confidence will not return. Those who got us into this crisis cannot have undue influence in shaping the response. 
 America has great assets, including a productive labor force and the best universities in the world. None of these assets so far has been impaired by Wall Street's follies. These strengths, coupled with a sensible and fair economic stimulus package and judicious regulation, will help our economy recover.

HEADLINE: Big Day, Big Crowds, Big Price Tag

BYLINE: By IAN URBINA

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Even for a city practiced at handling huge protests, marches and funerals, the inauguration of President-elect Barack Obama will put an unusual strain on local resources.
 Because Washington has been allotted only about $15 million in federal money to help pay for all major events in the city for the entire year, local officials say they are most concerned about the costs of handling the more than 1.5 million spectators expected to come here, the largest crowd in inaugural history. 
 The $15 million is roughly $2.3 million less than the city spent just for President Bush's second inauguration, in 2005, which attracted 300,000 spectators. 
 The amount also pales in comparison with the $50 million that Denver and St. Paul each received from the federal government for security for the Democratic and Republican national conventions this year.
 ''Our city has plenty of experience hosting the inauguration, and it cherishes being the seat of the federal government,'' said Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington's delegate to Congress. ''But it doesn't come cheap.''
 The expense comes as the city announced $130 million in budget cuts this month to deal with a revenue shortfall caused by the larger economic slowdown.
 Most of the inauguration is financed by private donations and federal money, but the city takes on a range of responsibilities. 
 While the Secret Service will oversee security, including the sharpshooters, air patrols and monitoring of the city's 5,000 or so surveillance cameras, most of the city's 4,100 police officers will help direct traffic, operate metal detectors and escort dignitaries. An additional 4,000 officers from surrounding states have been called in to bolster the city's force. It was unclear who would pay for them.
 The city will also be responsible for providing more than 1,200 first responders to handle medical emergencies and several hundred sanitation workers to clean up after the festivities.
 ''If we get snow, things could get even more expensive,'' said Dan Tangherlini, the city administrator, pointing out that in 1961, inauguration planners called out 700 troops with shovels and flamethrowers after an unexpected storm blanketed the city in eight inches of snow before John F. Kennedy's ceremony. To clear the snow from the inauguration parade route can cost the city more than $1 million alone, Mr. Tangherlini said. 
 Ms. Norton said she was trying to get an additional $15 million allocated to the city, since the $15 million already set aside was supposed to cover the cost of policing all large events throughout the year. 
 ''If we spend all these funds on the inauguration,'' she said, ''how is the city is going to pay for events like the Fourth of July celebration and the antiwar marches that happen every year and are federal in focus?''
 Despite such concerns, local businesses are expecting big benefits. 
 Restaurants throughout the city and hotels as far away as West Virginia are booked. The Metro transit system is charging $10 for commemorative tickets bearing Mr. Obama's picture. City residents have been posting advertisements on the Internet offering rooms in their homes for $500 a night. Others have even offered parking for a camping vehicle in their driveway for $80 a night, or tent space in their garden with access to toilet and shower facilities for $100 a night.
 The city and surrounding area have about 95,000 hotel rooms, which are quickly filling up and being priced at two to three times the normal rate.
 But the region's housing and transit systems may be stretched to capacity.
 While some federal officials are predicting crowds of 1.5 million people, Mayor Adrian M. Fenty of Washington has said the number could be as high as 3 million, breaking the record of 1.2 million who attended Lyndon B. Johnson's inauguration, in 1965. 
 The city is planning to run double the usual number of subway trains and buses. Eighteen Washington-bound trains on the Northeast Corridor are already sold out for the long weekend, and Amtrak is monitoring whether to add more trains to the schedule, said Cliff Black, a spokesman for Amtrak. Virginia Railway Express and Maryland's commuter trains typically do not run on federal holidays but will do so for the inauguration, city officials said. 
 Because of limited hotel space and limited budgets, many charter services are running ''there-and-back'' or ''turnaround'' specials. These buses will roll out the evening of Jan. 19, arrive in Washington the morning of the swearing-in and depart later that day.
 Some city officials worry that there is not enough room to handle the crowds, and they have been pushing for more space. 
 Officials from the National Park Service said they planned to open more areas than in past years along the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route. 
 A spokeswoman from the mayor's office said it had lobbied for National Park Service officials to open large sections of the Mall east of the Washington Monument, a space normally used for staging the many components of the inaugural parade. That would make the Mall a viewing area that experts said could accommodate several million people -- significantly more than in the past.
 It is not clear, though, if there will be enough indoor space for older people who cannot stand outdoors in frigid January cold. 
 ''There are so many people from around the country, especially older folks, who are saying this is the one thing they thought they would never see in their lifetime,'' Ms. Norton said, ''and so now they're saying they are not going to miss it for the world.'' 
 Older people may not realize they will have to walk long distances, she said, because, for security reasons, trains and buses will not be able to carry passengers all the way to the event site. 
 As an alternative, city officials and Ms. Norton have been pushing for inauguration planners to use arenas and stadiums to help with overflow crowds wanting to view the ceremonies on big-screen televisions. They are also urging churches to hold viewing parties. 
 ''But renting these facilities costs money too,'' Ms. Norton said, ''and so far it's not budgeted.''

HEADLINE: John A. Kitzhaber

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
As he prepares to take office, President-elect Barack Obama is relying on a small team of advisers who will lead his transition operation and help choose the members of the Obama administration. Following is part of a series of profiles of potential members of the administration.
 Name: John A. Kitzhaber 
 Being considered for: Interior secretary
 Would bring to job: Experience as a two-term governor of Oregon, a state as bruised as any by battles between industry (in this case the timber industry) and environmentalists -- the same kinds of battles that the interior secretary must referee around the interior West. Known as a conservationist with a knack for reaching out to industry. 
 Is linked to Mr. Obama by: Endorsement of his candidacy in April, after the current Democratic governor of Oregon, Ted Kulongoski, had endorsed Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 In his own words:
 ''A large part of the problem here is that we have framed the apparent conflict between economic activity and environmental stewardship as a mutually exclusive one, creating an ''us versus them'' mentality -- a sense of separateness and a politics of scarcity, which inevitably creates winners and losers but no pathway to a sustainable solution. And this politics of scarcity is perpetuated not so much by the people engaged in the debate but rather by the institutions and organizational structures through which they are seeking to resolve their disputes.'' (To a conference sponsored by Oregon Sea Grant, a university-based network of researchers and local marine specialists. April 3, 2007)
 Used to work as: An emergency-room doctor in the small timber town of Roseburg, Ore. He was also a state representative and a three-term state senator. As Oregon's governor, in the late 1990s, he worked with Michael O. Leavitt, then the Republican governor of Utah, and created a decision-making template they called ''enlibra'' to bring local groups together to solve intractable resource issues while adhering to the dictates of federal environmental standards. He has advocated a similar approach to the fights over the future of both endangered salmon and hydroelectric dams in the Columbia River system. Since stepping down from the governor's office in 2003, he has served as president of the Estes Park Institute, which holds educational conferences for community hospitals. He is also the director of the Center for Evidence-Based Policy at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. 
 Also known for: Skill as a fly fisherman and river rafter; he has made several solo journeys along the Class III and IV rapids of Oregon's Rogue River. He is prone to including poetry in his speeches, and blogs occasionally on his Web site, http://johnkitzhaber.org.
 Carries as baggage: A very obvious taste for a cabinet appointment in the new administration, as reflected in a recent Associated Press interview. In terms of policy, he is open to dam removal in parts of the Columbia River system, a highly controversial view. He is divorced and the father of son Logan, 11, making him reluctant to spend prolonged periods of time in Washington away.
 Resume includes: Born March 5, 1947, in Colfax, Wash. ... graduated from Dartmouth with a degree in biology in 1969 ... graduated from the University of Oregon Medical School in Portland in 1973 .... interned at General Rose Memorial Hospital in Denver, Colo. ... in 1996, he told the magazine Nursing Economics that he once wanted to become a medical researcher and construct artificial organs.

HEADLINE: Taking a Stroll Along the High Line

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE

 BODY:
ON a bright, blustery afternoon in November, construction workers were packing up their gear on the High Line, the park being created atop the old elevated railway in the West Chelsea area of Manhattan, leaving it empty for a few intrepid visitors to tour. Even amid the bitter cold and building materials, it was easy to see why the project has inspired even some of the most jaded New Yorkers.
Designed by an architectural team from Field Operations and Diller Scofidio + Renfro, the High Line offers a retreat from street life, a bucolic space floating 30 feet in the air with Hudson River views. Yet it retains many elements of its gritty past: graffiti is prevalent on the buildings it wends through, and some of the rails have been restored in the park. That the park -- which grew from an idea hatched 10 years ago into a $170 million project --is being built at all is a marvel. 
''When we first started people thought it was crazy,'' said Robert Hammond, a co-founder of Friends of the High Line, the community group that pushed for the park.
No longer. The first section of the park will open to the public this spring, but it has already transformed the area near its 22-block stretch near the river, prompting some of the most ambitious development in the city in years.
Condominiums, hotels and office buildings -- designed by architectural talent like Jean Nouvel, Annabelle Selldorf, Renzo Piano, and the Della Valle Bernheimer firm -- are sprouting along the park's span, which runs from Gansevoort Street to 34th Street. About 1.5 million square feet of construction is already under way, with an additional 2.5 million square feet in planning stages, according to Robert C. Lieber, the deputy mayor for economic development. All told, that translates into roughly $4 billion in private investment, he said.
A stroll down the High Line, starting at the north end of the first phase, at 20th Street and 10th Avenue, and heading south toward Gansevoort, provides a glimpse of what is to come.
Near the Frank Gehry building for IAC/InterActiveCorp on 11th Avenue, between 17th and 18th Streets, a 21-story residential tower designed by Mr. Nouvel is rising. Marketing literature promises ''the most highly engineered and technologically advanced curtain wall ever constructed in New York City,'' with a ''Mondrian-like window pattern'' of nearly 1,700 panes of glass.
East of the park is 520 West Chelsea, a residential building by Ms. Selldorf, combining a glass facade with blue-glazed terra cotta. Keep strolling and you come across the Caledonia, a $350 million residential development by the Related Companies and Taconic Investment Partners that looms over the High Line at West 17th Street. The building contains a mix of 190 condos and 288 rental units, including 56 designated for low-income renters.
Then it's on to the High Line Building, the 10-story glass office tower by the developer Charles Blaichman and designed by Morris Adjmi that is rising atop the High Line and a former meatpacking plant.
Above Washington Street, Andre Balazs's highly anticipated Standard Hotel is nearing completion. The 18-story hotel, designed by Polshek Partnership Architects, literally straddles the High Line. It is expected to have a soft opening in December with about a third of the 330 rooms open. A restaurant and rooftop pool and lounge won't open until next February or March.
At the south end of the park, a new branch of the Whitney Museum designed by Renzo Piano will provide a cultural bookend. The new museum is expected to open in late 2012.
And on that bitterly cold November afternoon, a nattily dressed man and his entourage appeared, heading for the Standard Hotel. It was Mr. Balazs, the developer. He confirmed a December soft opening -- ''very soft,'' he says. When asked how much the hotel's rooms would cost, he said: ''I don't know. The market is changing so fast.''
That sentiment hints at the discomfort some developers are feeling as their grand plans run up against a deteriorating economy and credit squeeze. Even the High Line district, as it is being called, cannot escape the tightening economic vise.
The developers of the Nouvel tower have run into cost increases and delays; its opening has been pushed back from December to next summer.
And there are no signs of construction yet on a couple of lots near the 18th Street entrance to the High Line, where Edison Properties plans to build two towers designed by the architect Robert A. M. Stern. Edison did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
Still, many condominium buildings have presold their units. Residents have started moving into condos in the Caledonia. Its condos sold out in eight months starting in 2006, at prices from $600,000 to $4 million. And the rental units began being offered in May.
More than 80 percent of the Nouvel building's condo units have sold, at prices from $2 million to $22 million, said Craig Wood, the developer, including two sales in late September. Despite the difficult environment, his firm, Cape Advisors Inc., refinanced its construction loans in September, he said.
Charles R. Bendit, a co-chief executive of Taconic Investment Partners, said: ''We all imagine the High Line will be a phenomenal amenity for the area.''
John H. Alschuler Jr., chairman of HR&A Advisors, a real estate appraisal firm, estimated that proximity to the High Line has added 10 to 15 percent to the value of properties. And New York City officials have predicted that the High Line park will bring the city $900 million in revenue over 30 years.
Even as the first phase is readied for a spring opening, a second phase, from 20th to 30th Street, is expected to be completed in 2010. Mr. Hammond, whose organization will oversee the park in a new role as a conservancy, is taking the long view.
''We're in this for the long term,'' he said, and in an otherwise dismal economy, the High Line ''is a real bright spot.''
He added: ''It shows that New York can still think big and do big things.''
