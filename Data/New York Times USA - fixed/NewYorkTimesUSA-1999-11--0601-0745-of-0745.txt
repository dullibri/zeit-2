HEADLINE: LESSONS;
Attention to Scores Comes at a Price

BYLINE: By Richard Rothstein 

 BODY:
THERE is a national consensus that students need more competency in reading, math, science and history. But Americans also want schools to teach citizenship, healthful lifestyles and creativity. When people rely mostly on test scores to assess school quality, do they unwittingly sacrifice these other goals?
When schools are accountable only for higher scores, teachers inevitably emphasize more easily testable skills. Less easily tested ones get shorter shrift. For example, it is simpler to test vocabulary than creative writing, so test-driven curriculums may dilute literacy, not enhance it. 
 Just as important, tests do not assess important nonacademic competencies. The public once trusted teachers and administrators to find a good balance between math, reading, arts, health and other activities. They may not always have gotten it right, but today's data-driven accountability systems may not achieve a good balance either. If basic skills were undervalued before, they are probably overemphasized now.
Curriculum planning requires weighing alternatives. Teachers must decide whether to devote time to mock elections that develop citizenship habits, or to arithmetic and vocabulary practice. Teachers evaluated only by student test scores are less likely to schedule the elections.
Schools increasingly confront such dilemmas. Consider the Academy of Communications and Technology in Chicago, with mostly poor and minority students. It may be closed if scores do not improve, so it now requires extra drills in basics. To find time, teachers eliminated student discussions and debates of social issues.
Charlestown High in Boston also enrolls disadvantaged youth. It has doubled math and English requirements for half its ninth graders because they cannot graduate without passing state exams. To schedule this extra drill, students must drop an elective, like fine arts or gym.
And in the affluent Washington suburb of Waterford, Va., an elementary school has cut back music assemblies and dropped plans for environmental studies because these cannot increase passing rates on statewide exams.
Certainly, the current math and science focus is working. More high schoolers now study precalculus, biology, chemistry and physics. Test scores are rising. But more teenagers have fatty diets; physical education enrollment has plummeted. Meanwhile, adolescent obesity has soared. Neither children nor our economy will prosper if graduates have higher scores, but are overweight, with poor exercise habits or irresponsible sexual behavior. Should Charlestown High do less algebra, and increase health education instead?
Employers today seek workers with problem-solving skills. But pressure to raise scores tells schools to de-emphasize cooperative, project-based learning because teamwork is not measured on standardized exams.
People want schools to teach conflict resolution by negotiation, not violence. But there is no standardized test for tolerance.
It is curious that while Americans hold schools increasingly accountable only for test scores, they also insist that schools do more. A recent Gallup poll found that 46 percent of the public wanted schools' main emphasis to be training students to "take responsibility." Only 39 percent say it should be academics. The rest think teaching cooperation should have priority.
In 1994, Congress set national education goals -- being "first" in math and science was one, but others included preparing youth for responsible citizenship (with opportunities for community service), ensuring that students "are healthy and fit" and having them "appreciate the nation's diverse heritage."
Academics may be schools' most important activity, but perhaps Americans should sacrifice a few points in seniors' math scores if that is what it takes to inspire more of them to register to vote. Perhaps not. The public cannot debate these choices if schools are accountable only for basic skills results.
Standardized tests have improved many American schools. Nonetheless, society pays a price for this progress. If Americans do not equally demand accountability for less easily measured outcomes, they risk the balanced program they seek from public education.

HEADLINE: The Economy Doesn't Need the Third Way

BYLINE: By James K. Galbraith; James K. Galbraith is an economist at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas.

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex.

 BODY:
At his meeting with other progressive political leaders in Florence, Italy, President Clinton said some things that were admirable -- he called for debt relief for poor nations and ratification of the Child Labor Convention -- and a few others that sounded a little far-fetched, as when he celebrated the "little genomic maps" that he said would soon be sent home with new babies.
But one bit of his commentary pointed to a serious problem with the economically conservative and socially liberal policy mix known as the Third Way. "The liberal left parties in the rich countries should be the parties of fiscal discipline," Mr. Clinton said. "It is a liberal, progressive thing to balance the budget and run surpluses if you're in a rich country today." 
 "Unless you have total deflation like Japan, you should always be running a balanced budget," he went on. "It keeps interest rates down for your own people, which creates jobs and lowers costs."
Yet only a few days earlier, the Federal Reserve had raised interest rates for the third time this year. The Fed today is just as inflation-obsessed as always, and neither Mr. Clinton nor the surpluses can influence it. The budget surpluses that emerged in the past two years have not kept interest rates down.
The truth is that the good economy produced the appearance of fiscal discipline, rather than fiscal discipline producing a good economy. Lower interest rates kicked off this process, beginning back in 1992, when, despite big deficits, these rates were lower than they are today. Strong economic growth, full employment and low inflation together generated a powerful flow of tax revenue. Surpluses appeared as unemployment fell and growth proved stronger than forecasters had expected; they will disappear if and when the economy goes sour.
Mr. Clinton did help the economy, in part by protecting Social Security, expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit and modestly raising the minimum wage. But Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, did more -- by doing nothing. By not raising interest rates after 1995 while unemployment fell, ignoring dire warnings that inflation would spiral out of control, Mr. Greenspan helped to create both full employment and the budget surpluses.
This brings us to another question the president raised in Florence. "One of the big debates we're having in America now," he said, "is how long we can keep this economic expansion going." This is the outstanding issue -- not least because every time in the last 50 years the budget went into surplus, save once during the Korean War, a recession followed. The mechanism is called fiscal drag: too much taxing, too little spending.
The president credited our expansion to "productivity gains of technology" -- something no one really knows much about -- and to the "power of open borders and open trade to restrain inflation," which is real enough. But the big hero, in fact, is the American household, with its stoic willingness to take out the mortgage loans, the car loans and the credit card loans that have kept the economy growing. Private household debt has exploded, as has the stock market, and neither can rise forever. And with banks consolidating and diversifying and Congress preparing punitive new bankruptcy provisions while the Fed inches rates upward, one can see the reckoning in the works.
Having built up private debts, we now need to support private incomes. We can do this by raising wages and supporting employment, by modestly expanding public-sector investments and social programs, and by further reducing tax burdens on lower-income people. If the public debt rises a bit, private debts can come back into line. Meanwhile, interest rates have to stay where they are -- or even come down next year.
Nothing works forever. The Third Way notion that progressive governments should always be running a balanced budget unless prices are actually falling is silly. Franklin Roosevelt was not wrong to run a deficit in the 1930's, and Lyndon Johnson was not wrong to run them in the 1960's. The right policy is to pursue full employment. And that may mean shifting strategies from time to time.

HEADLINE: Stores at the Mall Try To Reclaim Christmas;
Retailers Face E-Commerce Challenge

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
As Internet retailers crow that the country is about to have another e-Christmas, brick-and-mortar stores are striking back.
Take wish-list programs, first promoted by online sites as the perfect Internet holiday convenience; they are now being usurped by traditional shopping destinations. 
 A me-generation update of the bridal registry, the wish list allows any acquisitive consumer to record gift choices by simply checking size, color and model number. Dan Swaab, a 29-year-old architect, recently put a black pullover from the clothing outlet Butch Blum and a customized picture frame from a store called Fireworks, among other items, on his list. But instead of signing up on a computer site, he did so at the University Village shopping mall outside Seattle, which has been providing forms since the beginning of November for visitors to fill in as they visit their favorite boutiques.
The completed lists can be dropped off at locations throughout the complex and are entered into a database (at no cost to shoppers) that is available both on the mall's Internet site and at kiosks. Mr. Swaab, who says he is familiar with the Internet but "not a full-bore browser," sees no advantage to doing a wish list solely on the Internet. "Returns can be such a hassle," he explains. "This way I've tried everything on."
Even if online sales this Christmas reach the high-end predictions of $12 billion, traditional retailers will ring up about 14 times that amount. But mall merchants need to do more than hold their own during the season that accounts for much of their profits for the year. Retailers know they are facing a pervasive stereotype that real-world holiday shopping is a parking and service nightmare. So to make sure Americans do not stay home in front of their computers to buy gifts, stores are beefing up basics like customer service and displaying innovative incentives that range from cash to psychics who select something for hard to please in-laws.
The holiday season always brings out a creative streak in merchants, and that has been accented this year by fear. Since the economy remains strong, the official outlook for Christmas 1999 is very bullish -- the National Retail Federation predicts total sales will be about $184 billion, up 6 percent from last year. But the growth in retail sales slowed in October and November, suggesting that consumers might not be as willing to dip into their pockets to satisfy their appetite for DVD players and pashmina shawls. For merchants who rely on Christmas foot traffic for a large chunk of the year's sales, the potential softening of consumer demand has combined with heightened Internet hype to put them on edge.
Although most merchants and malls will not admit having such Internet fears for the record, retail analysts say the early rush to put decorations in the windows and the ever-earlier markdowns show that retailers on the ground are feeling pressed. "Mostly traditional retailers are acting very defensively about Christmas," said Wendy Liebmann, president of WSL Strategic Retail, a consulting firm. "They feel that all the talk on the Internet is going to drain them."
Among the most interesting retailers to watch this season are those whose livelihoods are most directly challenged by the Web. The Web site of Borders Group is a footnote in the battle between Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com to dominate cyberspace book sales, but the chain is rolling out holiday ideas to remain competitive for in-store sales.
This season, Border's stores will hold art-and-crafts workshops where children can make bookmarks out of construction paper and crayons. The chain will also hand out booklets of appropriate quotations for book inscriptions for the wit impaired. For example, shoppers giving books on personal finance are advised to copy a quote from Mark Twain, "The lack of money is the root of all evil," onto the front flap. "We wanted to be an extra resource for our customers this year," Ann Binkley, a company spokeswoman, said.
Malls, which have the most to lose if shoppers decide to avoid their crowds and parking headaches, are also being creative. Gurnee Mills outside of Chicago has set up a Psychic Aid Station, where "tried and tested" clairvoyant Joanna Ammons will conduct free readings to help shoppers with holiday gift ideas every Saturday to Dec. 18. Ms. Ammons, who says she has successfully predicted 94 marriages, 74 divorces and 8 lottery/casino lucky winnings in the first six months of this year, only requires the name and date of birth of a loved one to divine the perfect stocking stuffer.
Other malls owned by the Mills Corporation will have "procrastination stations" where Mrs. Claus will be on hand to offer last-minute gift suggestions and maps, as well as milk and cookies. Naturally, Santa will be there, too. As an extra incentive to shoppers, the mall is offering to take photos of their children to create postcards that can be sent free to anyone in the country.
Even retailers that have been doing well with consumers are looking for new twists to make their stores more appealing. Target, the stylish discounter owned by the Dayton Hudson Corporation, has opted for a very direct kind of consumer gratification: money. Each day in November and December, a user of the Target credit card will win $2,000 as part of a "2000 'til 2000" promotion.
And Banana Republic, a unit of Gap Inc. and a formidable Internet presence itself, is taking its cut at luring the technology generation by providing services like free cell phone recharging and a download to Palm Pilot devices that includes a top 10 list of attractions near its flagship stores in urban centers.
Employees of the Electronics Boutique chain will be roving the aisles with hand-held cash registers in 30 of its Northeastern stores. Seth Levy, the company's chief information officer, calls the new system "a line buster." He adds that the devices, which are equipped to take credit card sales, create an intimate transaction. "If I can talk to you face-to-face in front of the register, we feel it is a closer relationship than if there is a four-foot block of wood between us," Mr. Levy said.
Beyond the innovations, improved convenience is a mantra among the stores this season, as they are determined to combat the perception that the Internet is less annoying for shopping, according to J'Amy Owens, president of the Retail Group, a Seattle-based consulting firm.
For example, Toys "R" Us Inc., the big retailer that has taken a thrashing at the hands of disenchanted consumers in recent years and faces fierce online competition from Amazon.com and Etoys.com, has put special effort into polishing its performance for this all-important season. Starting in June, the retailer sent sales associates through a training program at the Disney Institute to teach them to be more responsive to requests and more informed about the products.
Big department stores, which some say are difficult to shop in because entering, reaching the gift and exiting can be tiresome, are again focusing on "bundling" -- the practice of choosing gifts, prewrapping them and putting them out front where consumers can grab them on the go. For example, Provenance, a vitamin and herbal retailer newly available on the cosmetics floor at Macy's, has packaged groups of products in iridescent fabric and given them names like Peace and Holiday Survival, which contains an enzyme dietary supplement.
Bloomingdale's will be experimenting with a new kiosk technology that allows visitors to bypass the sales staff and do everything from search for a product to complete a purchase through the interactive machines.
"Retailers show that they are not going to roll over and die on the customer service sword," Ms. Owens said. "The real surprise this season is that the traditional retailers are going to clean the clock of the e-retailers. I am predicting a lot of online flops."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS;
All Key Gauges Are Down In Pre-Thanksgiving Lull

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Stocks tumbled yesterday, with the Nasdaq market having its worst point loss in more than a month. Investors sold shares to capture profits from the recent rally.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 93.89 points, to 10,995.63. 
 Broader stock indicators also declined. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 49.69, to 3,342.87, in its worst performance since Oct. 15. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 16.30, to 1,404.64.
In a quiet session ahead of Thanksgiving, many investors appeared to be locking in profits from last week's gains. Most oil stocks, which have risen in recent sessions along with the price of crude oil, slipped yesterday. Texaco and Chevron both fell.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq set 14 new closing highs in the previous 17 sessions as investors embraced a wide range of computer-related shares.
But the strongest drivers of the Nasdaq rally have been big, costly stocks like Intel and Cisco Systems. If those shares falter, the rest of the index typically drops back as well, said Ralph Bloch, chief market analyst at Raymond James & Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
"The average stock hasn't done nearly as well," he said. "Good fundamentals and strong growth are clearly in the tech sector, but even there, you've got to be in the big names."
Big losses from a handful of less-known companies dragged the Nasdaq lower. Extreme Networks, which makes equipment for data networks, plunged 24 1/8, to 70 1/8, after a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst expressed concern about the company's fourth-quarter sales.
America Online was the most-active stock on the New York Stock Exchange, posting a solid gain. America Online's 2-for-1 split took effect yesterday. It closed at 83 7/8, up 2 3/16.
The market showed no significant response to the Commerce Department's report on durable goods. The department said orders for items expected to last at least three years declined 1.3 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted $200.9 billion. Analysts had expected orders to rise by 1 percent.
The report suggested to some that the economy had begun to slow, perhaps satisfying the Federal Reserve in its watch over inflation. The Fed has raised interest rates three times this year, hoping to hold the nation's fierce economic growth to a more sustainable pace.
But David Orr, chief economist at First Union Securities, suggested that the report was skewed by a steep drop in orders for electronic equipment.

HEADLINE: More African Women Have AIDS Than Men

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 

 BODY:
AIDS has long been considered primarily a men's disease. But yesterday the United Nations reported for the first time that more women than men were infected with the AIDS virus in Africa, the site of a vast majority of such infections in the world.
In a report released in advance of World AIDS Day on Dec. 1, the United Nations said that of the 22.3 million adults in sub-Sahara Africa with H.I.V., the AIDS virus, 12.2 million, or 55 percent, are women. 
 This is the first time that data have been available to make such a comparison, officials said.
The officials said the precise reasons for the shift were unclear, though they noted that H.I.V. was spread in Africa primarily through heterosexual intercourse. The virus passes more easily from men to women than from women to men.
"Ten years ago, it was hard to make people listen when we were saying AIDS wasn't just a man's disease," said Dr. Peter Piot, head of the Joint United Nations Program on H.I.V./AIDS, which joins a number of agencies, including the World Health Organization.
Infection rates among women are much lower in the United States and other developed countries than in Africa. But more women, primarily in minority groups, are becoming infected through heterosexual sex in this country, Dr. Piot said.
The new evidence that Africa has six infected women for every five infected men comes from a number of studies in several African countries, Unaids said. Many AIDS experts have assumed that more women were infected than men in Africa. But documentation was not possible because much of the data was not broken down by sex, Dr. Bernhard Schwartlander, an epidemiologist for the agency and a principal author of the report, said in an interview.
Another factor in the shifting demographics in Africa, the report said, is the different age patterns of H.I.V. infection in men and women. Studies in several countries have found that African girls 15 to 19 are five to six times as likely to have the virus as boys their own age. Men tend to be more promiscuous, and "older men, who often coerce girls into sex or buy their favors with sugar-daddy gifts, are the main source of H.I.V. for the teenage girls," the report said.
To reduce the risk to women, Dr. Piot said, health workers need to devise strategies to change men's actions, starting with sex education among boys. Another goal is to reduce the cost of female condoms, so they can be used more widely.
Although Africa is by far the continent most affected by the virus, with nearly 70 percent of the infected people in the world living in the countries below the Sahara, AIDS remains an unabated epidemic in many countries. This year, an estimated 5.6 million adults and children became infected with the virus, bringing to more than 50 million the worldwide total since the AIDS epidemic was first recognized in 1981. Thirty-three million infected people are alive today. But AIDS has killed 16 million; 2.6 million of them died in 1999, a record for any year.
"AIDS remains a fatal disease" despite the availability of newer combinations of drugs, Dr. Piot said, and "the threat of H.I.V. has not diminished in any country."
How high will the number of AIDS cases reach worldwide? Dr. Schwartlander said the answer would depend on the number of infections in Asia, a number that cannot be determined now. Because the factors that influence changes in sexual behavior are difficult to predict and because risk factors like injecting drugs vary, he said, Unaids cannot predict when AIDS will peak.
Even if prevention programs completely stopped new infections, deaths would increase for years, because third world countries cannot afford drugs to fight the virus, and their health systems are overwhelmed by related illness.
The steepest curve in rising infection rates in 1999 was in the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, where drug use by injection is increasingly common among unemployed people and schoolchildren. In the Russian federation, nearly half of all reported cases of H.I.V. infection since the start of the epidemic were recorded in the first nine months of 1999 alone.
H.I.V. rates in adults are about 2 percent in the Caribbean, the highest outside sub-Sahara Africa, where it is 8 percent. "AIDS has emerged as the single greatest threat to development in many countries of the world," Dr. Piot said.
Life expectancy in southern Africa, which climbed to 59 in the early 1990's from 44 in the early 50's, is expected to drop back to 45 in 10 years. Fewer than 50 percent of the South Africans now alive can expect to reach 60, compared with 70 percent for developing countries and 90 for industrialized countries.
A survey of commercial farms in Kenya found that illness and death now rivaled old-age retirement as the leading reason why employees left work. Some life insurance companies have found that a third or more of deaths are related to H.I.V., even in plans that require a negative test as a condition of acceptance.
Unaids noted some bright spots. Strong prevention efforts have had sustained success in lowering or stabilizing rates in the Philippines, Thailand and a few other countries.
Dr. Piot said that political efforts were increasing in a number of countries, but that it took five years before statistics showed improvement.
Dr. Seth Berkley, head of the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative, said, "A vaccine is the world's best hope for ending the pandemic."

HEADLINE: America Online Deal With Intuit

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
America Online Inc., the top Internet service provider, and Intuit Inc., the maker of the popular Quicken financial software, said yesterday that they would provide an online bill-paying service to AOL's more than 19 million subscribers.
Terms of the five-year agreement were not disclosed. Intuit will be the exclusive provider of bill tracking and payment services for America Online's flagship service and the AOL.com World Wide Web site, starting early next year. 
 America Online is offering the service as the number of households using the Internet to pay bills is expected to increase tenfold to 18 million by 2003. About 55 percent of consumers who use the Internet said they would be interested in paying bills online, according to a study from Roper Starch Worldwide and America Online.
Intuit and America Online will let utilities, credit card companies and other billing companies present bills online to their customers using encryption technology.
The service will also be available to users of America Online's CompuServe service.
America Online has not determined yet whether a fee will be charged. Intuit is the top maker of personal-finance software.

HEADLINE: Definition of Abortion Is Found to Vary Abroad

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
The recipient of the largest amount of American birth control aid is Bangladesh, a Muslim country that languishes among the world's sickest, poorest and most populous. Despite a decision by Congress last week to limit federal spending on groups that promote abortion rights abroad, the way the United States' contribution is spent in Bangladesh depends much more on local laws and practices than on anything done half a world away on Capitol Hill.
Officially, Bangladesh prohibits abortion except to save a mother's life. But the government of Bangladesh, an emphatic proponent of birth control, and the nongovernment Family Planning Association of Bangladesh, an affiliate of International Planned Parenthood Federation in London, do condone a practice that amounts to the same thing in the first 10 weeks of pregnancy. 
 In the procedure, which the government and the federation call "menstrual regulation," a woman who complains of having missed a period, rather than being given a pregnancy test, can be treated by a health care worker who suctions away the lining of the uterine wall, including any fertilized egg.
The government defines this as "an interim method of establishing nonpregnancy," according to a study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a women's research organization in New York. It does not consider the procedure an abortion, because the woman does not take a pregnancy test and therefore is never officially deemed to be pregnant.
In the legislation Congress passed to restore American financing of the United Nations, Representative Christopher H. Smith, Republican of New Jersey, won inclusion of a clause restricting the United States Agency for International Development from using its money for family planning -- $385 million for a fourth consecutive year, down from $547 million in 1995 -- to perform or promote abortions.
Once it was negotiated with the White House, however, the provision left family planning groups with many ways around the restrictions. It prohibits agency financing for organizations that perform or promote abortions, whether with United States money or with their own. But it applies only to foreign, nongovernment organizations. Foreign governments and American organizations that operate abroad can still get the aid.
In a country where abortions are already illegal, like Bangladesh, if the organizations continue to promote contraception but agree not to lobby for looser regulation of abortion, they are operating within the boundaries established by Congress and can continue to receive money.
And the definition of terms is left to the Agency for International Development and the foreign governments. So what Bangladesh calls "menstrual regulation" is not considered abortion under the law.
Grover Joseph Rees, chief counsel of the House subcommittee that wrote the provision, said it also leaves the Clinton administration free to define abortion. The administration can decide whether it applies to aspiration, or suctioning of the uterine lining, for example, or heavy doses of mifepristone, the pill a woman takes to abort an embryo soon after she suspects she might have become pregnant.
"If this is an abortion," Mr. Rees said, "some agency has to say it is an abortion." In the case of vaginal aspiration or heavy doses of mifepristone, he said, "A.I.D. ought to say it is. Smith would regard that as abortion." If the agency agrees, the organization would have to stop the practice or lose its subsidy. Officials at the agency declined repeated requests for comment for this article.
The legislation also provides that if the president waives the provision, a penalty of $12.5 million will be deducted from the $385 million allotted to the agency for family planning and will be diverted to children's health programs.
The restriction has a long history. In 1973, Congress prohibited subsidies to foreign nongovernment organizations that used them for abortion, and that law remains in effect.
In 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed an executive order prohibiting the organizations that received American financing from using other money -- their own or foundations' or other countries' contributions -- to promote abortion. President Clinton revoked the Reagan order upon taking office in 1993, and Mr. Smith's provision put the terms of the Reagan order into law.
While Americans argued about the provision, international family planning groups have worked to decrease their dependence on American financing. At the same time, they say, their efforts are helping reduce birth rates in many nations.
The United States remains the world's largest source of nearly $2 billion a year that the United Nations estimates that industrial countries spend to subsidize family planning in developing countries. But the Netherlands, once a relatively small contributor, is now the second largest, followed by Germany, Britain and Japan. Private American donors, including the Ford, Rockefeller, MacArthur, Packard, Mellon and Gates foundations, have been stepping in, too.
The Agency for International Development reports that in the developing countries that receive its family planning support, the fertility rate, or the average number of babies born to a woman, dropped from 4.4 in 1985 to 3.3 in 1997. In populous Indonesia, the rate had fallen by half, from 5.6 in 1971 to 2.6 two years ago. Bangladesh has achieved a major objective of its national population policy in cutting its rate from an average of six babies per woman to three.
With the world population now at 6 billion and climbing by 70 to 80 million a year, nations are still far short of achieving the fertility rate of 2.1 children per woman that demographers say would stabilize the population and relieve pressure on world resources. Most women in sub-Saharan Africa have six or more children.
"There are still large numbers of unwanted children," said John Bomgaarts, vice president of the Population Council in New York. "Forty-five percent of pregnancies worldwide are unintended -- mistakes or unwanted."
From the beginning, the abortion opponents' No. 1 target has been the International Planned Parenthood Federation in London. With affiliated family planning services in 140 countries, the federation dwarfs all other foreign nongovernment groups in promoting birth control and abortion.
Pramilla Senanayake, assistant director general of the Planned Parenthood organization in London, said the London office's budget last year was $90.6 million. With that and at least $400 million that the affiliates collect independently, about three-quarters from their own local sources, the federation says its affiliates distributed 250,000 condoms a day in 1997 and 600,000 oral contraceptive pills a day. It says the affiliates saw 100,000 clients a day for sexual and reproductive health services, including abortions.
As required by law, Dr. Senanayake said the federation uses none of its A.I.D. money -- $9.2 million last year, or 10 percent of its budget -- to perform or promote abortion. Rather than let the United States derail its work, the federation may have to refuse future financing, as it did after President Reagan's order was issued and until President Clinton revoked it.
Dr. Senanayake said the federation is likely to carry on. The government of Japan has now displaced the United States as the biggest contributor. But there could still be a cost.
"What the U.S. government is doing," she said, "is increasing inadvertently the number of unsafe abortions. These women will be pushed to go and have back-street abortions."

HEADLINE: Metropolitan Life Sets Plan for Issuing Stock to Policyholders

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER 

 BODY:
Metropolitan Life, one of the nation's largest life insurers, intends to file a formal plan with New York State regulators today for a reorganization in which it will issue shares next spring. The stock would instantly become the most widely held in the United States.
Executives of the insurer, which is formally owned by policyholders and known as a mutual company, said they expected shares to be distributed to as many as 10 million policyholders, giving the company far more shareholders than the current leader, Lucent, which has 4.6 million shareholders. 
 The company said it expected to issue 838 million shares valued at $14 to $24 each. Most of the shares will go to policyholders as compensation for their ownership in the company, but the company expects to raise up to $5.6 billion in sales to outsiders.
Kevin Foley, a spokesman for MetLife, said it is not clear how many shares would go to each policyholder. But he said the shares would be apportioned according to several factors, including the value of the insurance, and added that the vast majority of the company's policies were worth $10,000 or less.
MetLife is one of several big insurers that are abandoning their mutual structure, which was created to provide insurance to people at the lowest possible price and which functions much like a cooperative. MetLife began moving toward restructuring about a year ago.
Mutual insurers, including the John Hancock Insurance Company in Boston and the Prudential Insurance Company of America, say that the creation of publicly held shares will give them a currency to use in acquiring other insurers and businesses like banks and brokerage firms as the financial services industry consolidates. All the leaders hope to dominate their markets and to achieve greater economies of scale.
The conversion will also provide a fortune in bonuses for the executives of MetLife and the other mutual companies who, for the first time, will be able to receive stock options. MetLife executives will be able to receive options a year after the initial public offering, which, according to a spokesman, Kevin Foley, is expected to take place in March.
Under New York law, a mutual company is required to distribute its accumulated profits or equity to its policyholders when it converts to shareholder ownership. In information being sent to policyholders and regulators, equity was shown as $13.5 billion. The plan must be approved by New York regulators and two-thirds of the policyholders who vote.
"The conversion to a stock company will compensate our policyholders for their membership interests in MetLife," said Robert H. Benmosche, the chief executive of the insurer, "and will provide MetLife with the capital structure it needs to aggressively pursue strategic opportunities."
While the vast majority of policyholders will be eligible to receive stock, Mr. Foley said, about 10 percent of the 11.5 million policyholders will receive cash or enhancements to their coverage because of tax laws and for ease of administration.
Mr. Foley said that for years the company had been unable to find about 600,000 holders of small insurance policies worth a few hundred dollars each.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
Lead or Get Out of The Way

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN 

DATELINE: COLOMBO, Sri Lanka

 BODY:
Scene #1: A few days after the coup in Pakistan, the coup leader, Gen. Pervez Musharraf, held a news conference that surely was a historical first. The Pakistani general said he had had to mount the coup in order to pull Pakistan out of its morass of corruption, and to prove that he was up to this task the general offered to disclose his tax returns. Think about that. When in the history of coups has a general sought to win legitimacy by offering to disclose his tax returns? He didn't vow to retake Kashmir or to nuke New Delhi. He vowed to prove that he had played straight with the Pakistani I.R.S.
Scene #2: I just attended a seminar in Sri Lanka organized by U.S. A.I.D. on competitiveness. The audience was made up of Sri Lankan, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi and Nepalese business leaders. One of the speakers was the former Costa Rican president Jose Maria Figueres, who gave the audience a spellbinding description of how Costa Rica got Intel to set up a factory there, started to bring the Internet into all its schools and successfully adapted to the Information Revolution. The audience of South Asians was awed, and when it came to question time, several people stood up and asked Mr. Figueres: "Would you run for president in my country?" 
 What's going on out here? It's this: We are entering an age when everyone increasingly knows how everyone else lives -- especially the 30-to-40-year-old educated generation in South Asia. And the more members of this generation know about wider trends in the world today, the more they realize that their own leaders don't "get it," the more they are feeling left behind, frustrated and willing to consider non-democratic alternatives.
A 46-year-old Sri Lankan woman banker said to me: "We have lost 25 years. In 1964 Lee Kuan Yew the leader of Singapore came to Sri Lanka and said Singapore should become like Sri Lanka. We were his model -- on literacy, on health care, on education. But now Singapore is the model and ours is a destiny we never achieved. So when people listened to Figueres, they said: 'Why can't we get leaders like this?' Where did he come from? How did he happen? Is it that people get the leaders they deserve? Have we done something wrong? We need to take all our leaders who are corrupt and bumbling and ostracize them, but we never do. There are so many people whose heads haven't rolled that should have."
No wonder, she added, that "so many people walked out after Mr. Figueres's speech and said, 'If we don't have that kind of competence within our own country, why can't we hire it?' One of the big Sri Lankan businessmen said to me, 'I wouldn't even mind paying his salary myself.' Look at the number of companies that Sri Lankans or Indians have started in Silicon Valley , but we don't have the leadership here to manage our own ship."
A Pakistani journalist, Anjum Ibrahim, remarked to me about the coup in her country: "I was confused. I didn't know whether to condemn the military or not. On the one side they put in power a general with no qualifications for running a government. But then there was nothing democratic about how the previous prime minister ruled -- except that he held elections. I'm not ambivalent about democracy. I'm ambivalent about those who claim to represent it in our country."
The reason this is bubbling over now is that the rising middle classes are becoming less economically dependent on the state for their livelihoods, but more aware that the state is still the plug and framework through which they will relate to today's global economy. If that plug is faulty, if it only works with bribes, if it has no rule of law or vision of how to succeed in this world, these rising middle classes will never thrive for long or protect what they have achieved. So they desperately want better governance -- any way they can.
"The middle classes all over South Asia are getting really teed off," says Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, Director of Sri Lanka's Center for Policy Alternatives. With the exception of India, he said, many people "are turning their backs on the electoral process and speaking now about 'partyless democracy.' Representative democracy in the subcontinent has earned a bad name, and it has come to a point where the whole notion of it is now being threatened."

HEADLINE: CLINTON IS STYMIED ON TRADE MEETING

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Presi dent Clinton has quietly tried and failed -- to persuade leaders of major countries to attend a huge trade conference in Seattle next week in order to break political deadlocks over workers' rights, agricultural subsidies and America's self-proclaimed authority to block low-cost imports.
Mr. Clinton's concerns were underscored today when negotiators for the 135 nations that will attend the conference abandoned their effort in Geneva to work out an agenda. Their failure calls into question whether Mr. Clinton can achieve many of his negotiating priorities. 
 At about the same time this afternoon, the White House gave up on its last-minute attempt to persuade the leaders of Japan, Brazil, the European Community and several developing countries to attend the ministerial conference of the World Trade Organization, after several leaders said they had scheduling conflicts.
The purpose of the conference is to lay the groundwork for a global "Millennium Round" of trade negotiations, which could last for at least three years. The inability of the negotiators to reach an agreement on the agenda after weeks of trying reflects fundamental disagreements on some of the most politically sensitive economic issues around the globe.
Mr. Clinton, for example, wants Europe to abandon its huge subsidies for farmers, which he says are protectionist measures intended to cripple more efficient American producers. The Europeans and the Japanese have refused, and have said that any trade accord must include the question of protecting rural communities -- a code-word for protecting the livelihoods of the farmers who live in those nations.
Meanwhile, Mr. Clinton has angered developing nations like India and Brazil by insisting that the next round of trade talks take up, for the first time, the question of protections for workers -- allowing the W.T.O., for example, to ban the export of goods made by child labor.
Officials from developing nations say that is merely an effort by the United States and Europe to erect barriers against low-cost goods -- and to satisfy their trade unions. It is also an issue for Vice President Al Gore, who has come under intense pressure from unions, whose support he needs in the presidential election next year, to kill any trade negotiations that do not make workers' concerns the top priority.
Those are only two of the many festering disputes that have plagued the negotiations leading up to the Seattle session starting next Tuesday, which is intended only to begin a negotiating round, rather than settle any of the issues.
But the new head of the World Trade Organization, Mike Moore, a blunt-speaking former politician from New Zealand, warned recently that the talks were "in danger of failure." Today, speaking in Geneva, he said trade ministers had gone as far as they could and that "it's now up to our political bosses to make this a success."
Several times during the last few weeks Mr. Clinton and his staff have tried to get some of those political bosses -- whether presidents or prime ministers -- to Seattle, hoping that the pressure of gathering them in one place would force several nations to compromise. They feared that trade and foreign ministers alone could not break the impasse.
But for weeks the White House got tangled up in the question of whom to invite, compiling lists and then abandoning them. "Every time we put together a list of names," a White House aide said, "it became clear that we would make 20 enemies."
In the end, to avoid the embarrassment of being explictly turned down, Mr. Clinton's top aides informally contacted Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan; Romano Prodi, the president of the European Commission; President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa; President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of Brazil; Prime Minister John Howard of Australia and a small number of others.
Several officials said the one leader most interested in attending was the one Mr. Clinton would not talk to: President Fidel Castro of Cuba.
"We started too late and it just didn't work," one White House official said today, insisting that no formal invitations were ever extended and that Mr. Clinton had never placed calls directly to the leaders.
Negotiating "trade rounds" is always contentious business: the last big negotiation, which created the World Trade Organization from a weaker predecessor, took years longer than orginally scheduled and left many issues completely unaddressed. And any new negotations promise to be even more complex.
New members of the World Trade Organization -- soon to include China -- argue that special rules should be cut for countries most afflicted by poverty and long isolation from the world economy. And longtime members, like France, are convinced that the United States is using its economic rise and unchallenged global power to draft rules that play to the strengths of American industry.
Some of the most bitter arguments have surrounded questions of labor standards -- a particularly difficult issue for Vice President Gore.
"The W.T.O., in a formal sense, does not recognize that links between trade and labor exist," Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, said today. "This is not a position which can endure. It is intellectually indefensible, and it will over time weaken public support for the trading system."
But many other countries refuse to discuss labor issues, saying that they are not interested in having the World Trade Organizaton dictate how much workers get paid, whether they should be allowed to form unions, or even how old they must be.
On a recent visit to India, one of Ms. Barshefsky's top aides, Sue Esserman, declared that "great democracies ignore labor issues at their peril," but she failed to persuade India's leaders to engage in a global study intended to lead the World Trade Organization to start setting labor standards.
There are similar divisions on enforcing intellectual property rights and other features of past trade accords. Many developing nations, for example, want more time before they enforce copyrights, an alien concept in many parts of the world.
The result of these disagreements is that negotiators in Geneva could not even agree on the scope of the coming negotiations.

HEADLINE: Sound Truck Newest Weapon To Combat Holiday Gridlock

BYLINE: By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN 

 BODY:
As city drivers veered out of intersections, muzzled their horns and cowered before car-boot-bearing traffic agents yesterday, the Mayor unleashed a new weapon against holiday gridlock -- a noisy sound truck spewing threats.
"Attention, motorists," bellowed a voice from the two banks of loudspeakers on the police van on the Avenue of the Americas at 42nd Street, amid the traffic congestion. "Do not double park. Please obey all traffic laws." 
 This grim tape loop, with separate messages for drivers and pedestrians, takes Don't Block the Box and Operation Move Along to a new level. "This sound truck is principally to enforce enforcement efforts," Inspector James Hegarty of the Police Department said at a news conference at Bryant Park yesterday.
The sound truck will tour Manhattan's most troubled intersections -- including the approaches to the 59th Street Bridge and the Lincoln Tunnel, and Times Square -- admonishing pedestrians to use crosswalks and urging motorists to use "consideration" for their fellow drivers.
Can a talking truck reduce vehicular chaos?
Pedestrian advocates did not give the sound truck, or the plan in general, high marks. John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, described it as an "Orwellian scheme to control the masses." He added, "The sound truck is odd and will just add to the cacophony."
The truck made its debut yesterday as part of the city's holiday traffic control plan, the result of good news for the city and bad news for drivers, as Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani explained yesterday.
The city's "unprecedented economic boom," he told reporters, has brought 60,000 more vehicles into Manhattan daily since 1997, pushing the total of cars on Manhattan's streets to a million a day.
The result: a crackdown on holiday traffic, and fear and loathing among drivers.
The plan includes an increase in traffic agents, police officers and tow-truck operators; a temporary halt to new, nonemergency street and sidewalk construction; a toll-free phone line to report gridlock; zero tolerance for double-parkers and those who block intersections; and more pedestrian barricades at clogged Midtown intersections.
The mayor was ever-ready with an answer for the plan's detractors: just take public transportation.

HEADLINE: Medicare Cuts Jolt New York Hospitals That Train Doctors

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 23

 BODY:
Teaching hospitals in New York said today that they would lose tens of millions of dollars in federal Medicare money under a budget bill that was passed by Congress last week and is soon to be signed by President Clinton.
Most hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers around the country supported the legislation, because it would restore some of the money cut from Medicare in 1997. But for more than a dozen teaching hospitals in New York, which depend heavily on federal aid, the gains would be more than offset by the loss of money they receive for training doctors. 
 The legislation, part of an omnibus appropriations bill, would reduce huge disparities in what Medicare pays to train doctors in different parts of the country. The average Medicare payment for each trainee is more than four times as much at some New York hospitals as in other big cities. Payments to those high-paid hospital would be frozen for two years. Then, in each of the next three years, the government would provide them with less than the normal adjustment for inflation given to all other teaching hospitals.
Calculations by the Greater New York Hospital Association show that Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx would lose $10 million from 2000 to 2005, while Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan would lose $8.3 million and Episcopal Health Services, with hospitals in Queens and Suffolk County, would lose $4.5 million.
Over that period, the association estimates, Harlem Hospital Center and Nassau County Medical Center would each lose $3.6 million, North Shore University Hospital would lose $2.8 million and Long Island Jewish Medical Center would lose $2.7 million.
Some of the major New York teaching hospitals have hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue, but most are poised uneasily between profit and loss, and some have experienced operating losses in recent years. Montefiore, for example, says it has more than $1 billion in revenue this year, including $85 million in Medicare payments for graduate medical education. But over all, the hospital will have an operating loss of $1 million to $5 million this year, said Dr. Spencer Foreman, president of Montefiore.
The overall bill had broad support in Congress, and President Clinton has said he plans to sign it next week. The House Ways and Means Committee said the bill would create "a more rational and equitable" method of paying for graduate medical education.
New York's Congressional delegation, led by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Representative Charles B. Rangel, has historically protected the state's teaching hospitals, which train more than 15 percent of the nation's doctors. New York lawmakers headed off even deeper cuts this year. But they could not halt the momentum to make fundamental changes in the reimbursement for teaching hospitals.
The winners include hospitals in Texas and California, two states with powerful House members who have a large say on Medicare policy. Academic medical centers in Texas, California and other Sun Belt states have risen in stature, even as lawmakers from those states gained influence in Congress in recent years.
Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of the Bronx, said the changes in Medicare reflected a Congressional "bias against New York." Such bias, he said, has become more pronounced since Republicans won control of the House five years ago.
Dr. Foreman of Montefiore echoed that view. "This was really pushing a bean up New York's nose," he said of the legislation.
On the House floor last week, Representative Mark Foley, Republican of Florida, said teaching hospitals in New York had been "bellyaching" about not getting enough money. Off the House floor, Congressional aides spoke disparagingly of hospital executives who rode limousines around New York City.
New York hospitals can take consolation in two facts. First, earlier versions of the Medicare legislation would have taken much more money from them. Second, most of the cuts take effect after Oct. 1, 2000. New York hospitals and politicians can try to persuade Congress to moderate the cuts before then. If Democrats win control of the House in next year's elections, Mr. Rangel will be in line to head the Ways and Means Committee.
Dr. Foreman said Montefiore would consider several steps to cope with the loss of federal money. "We have no choice but to whittle away at the work force, look at some programs that are not as productive as you might like and creatively pursue new lines of business," he said.
Asked what services he would consider reducing, Dr. Foreman said: "Any and all. There are no sacred cows."
Thomas J. Hayes, executive vice president of Beth Israel, said the cuts in federal aid for graduate medical education contradicted the original purpose of the Medicare legislation.
"This was supposed to be a bill to provide relief from the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997," Mr. Hayes said. "The cuts in medical education came out of the blue at the last minute."
Medicare's primary mission is to finance health care for people who are elderly or disabled. But it has also become the main vehicle for federal aid to teaching hospitals, providing some $7 billion a year. About one-third of the money helps pay the direct costs of medical education programs, including the salaries of doctors in training and their teachers and a share of overhead costs for items like classrooms.
Health policy experts have long been aware of regional disparities in Medicare's support for teaching hospitals. At least a half-dozen blue-ribbon panels have studied the issue in the last decade. But no action seemed imminent until The New England Journal of Medicine documented the disparities this summer. An article in the journal on July 22, using federal data, showed that teaching hospitals in New York got three or four times as much for each trainee as those in Los Angeles or Cleveland, and seven times as much as those in Houston.
Armed with this evidence, Representative Bill Thomas, the California Republican who is chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health, pushed for changes in the way Medicare pays teaching hospitals. Under the new formula, only the highest-paid teaching hospitals -- those with Medicare payments more than 40 percent above the national average for each hospital resident -- will lose money.
The disparities in Medicare payments have deep historical roots, reflecting differences in the way graduate medical education has been financed. In the Northeast, Dr. Foreman said, teaching hospitals have borne much of the cost, while elsewhere state governments and medical schools have paid a larger share.
Although the biggest losers are in New York, some teaching hospitals in other parts of the country will also lose money. The Greater New York Hospital Association estimates that Howard University Hospital in Washington will lose nearly $3 million from 2000 to 2005, while the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania will lose $2.2 million and St. Louis University Hospital will lose $1.3 million.
The association estimates that Pitt County Memorial Hospital, which is affiliated with the East Carolina University School of Medicine in Greenville, N.C., will lose $3.3 million from 2000 to 2005.
David C. McRae, chief executive of the Pitt County hospital, said: "Historically, we have been more dependent on Medicare than many other institutions. Therefore, like some teaching hospitals in New York, we are inordinately hard hit by the new legislation."

 BODY:
Two months after Mayor Bret Schundler threatened to lay off most of his civilian employees unless he got an extra $27.5 million in aid, the state responded yesterday by offering $16 million in aid and recommending $6.5 million in cuts.
The aid is part of a proposal by the State Division of Local Government Services to spend $54.5 million this fiscal year on the Aid to Distressed Cities program, which must be approved by legislators. Tom Damm, a division spokesman, said state auditors found 200 city jobs that could be cut without affecting services. 
 On Sept. 2, the mayor sent layoff notices to 959 city employees, insisting that a 1994 freeze on municipal aid helped create a fiscal crisis for the city. His chief of staff, Tom Gallagher, said the mayor considered the $16 million a "down payment" and would push for legislation to restore aid to 1994 levels, adjusted for inflation.

HEADLINE: Is Sprawl Strangling Atlanta?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "Suburban Comforts Thwart Atlanta's Plans to Limit Sprawl" (front page, Nov. 21): The Atlanta region is not in "crisis." Its booming economy and pleasant climate have attracted thousands of migrants who enjoy affordable suburban comforts without undue fear of natural disasters common elsewhere in the country. 
 True, traffic congestion has worsened as infrastructure investment has not kept pace with growth. Yet most of the solutions that have been suggested risk being counterproductive. Withholding federal money for roads to relieve congestion, building costly public transportation systems that people won't use, and stopping commercial projects that cause more traffic may well harm the region.

G-8 Minus One

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The Yeltsin "family" and its new K.G.B. front man, Vladimir Putin, came up with a plan to regain popularity in the coming elections: Use foreign funds to build up the army and -- under the pretext of anti-terrorism -- exterminate the militant Chechens.
So far, it's working. The Russian generals, humiliated by the independence forces five years ago, are using new tactics that inflict civilian casualties with missiles and artillery. Controlled media show victories, not 200,000 pitiful Chechen refugees or Russian body bags. The Yeltsin-Putin party's popularity is soaring. 
 As hubris takes over, the invading forces are being equipped with gas masks. Purely defensive, of course; Gen. Stanislav Petrov told Interfax that "the bandits are preparing to use highly toxic chemical weapons."
In the West, conventional wisdom says that this time the Russian Army will triumph. The Chechens are divided and impoverished; their key cities are being leveled. Outgunned and disillusioned, facing the terror of fuel-air explosives and Petrov's troops in gas masks, they have supposedly lost the will to fight.
Certainly the Clinton administration has lost the will to discourage this politically inspired war of ethnic extermination. "The last thing I think we should be doing," says Madeleine Albright, "is trying to turn Russia back into an enemy." No diplomatic consequences for indiscriminate killing; no stoppage of Western aid now being used to buy missiles and shells; just a few hand-wringing Clinton statements on how terrible it all is.
But maybe the conventional wisdom is mistaken. It could be that the Chechens will adapt to the new Russian tactics, and instead of defending towns, wage hit-and-run guerrilla war. Afghan allies may infiltrate; Muslim money may ship in weapons; occupying troops may be ambushed; and in time, Russian casualties will be revealed. Irrational Chechen grit has been underrated by both Stalin and Yeltsin.
If the war should drag on, the current tide of hubris would ebb. A few voices in Russia's press would wonder about the perpetrators of apartment-house bombings and other atrocities now conveniently blamed on Chechen terrorists.
Nobody knows what the next year in Chechnya will bring, other than blood and hatred. Nor can we tell what Russian candidate will be riding high in next summer's election. (A month ago, Yevgeny Primakov led all the polls; a year before, Boris Nemtsov shot to the top; the only consistent winner is "none of the above.")
But government savagery must have its consequences. Russia's "enemy" is its own militarism. As thousands are murdered and hundreds of thousands flee, we cannot adopt the Albright Corollary to the Clinton Doctrine: "We are trying very hard to keep our eye on the ball about what is important."
What is important is to provide disincentives to despotism. Suspend U.S. Export-Import Bank lending. End the self-deluding practice of continuing to allow Russia not to repay the money it owes the I.M.F. Make certain the money we give Russia to dismantle nuclear weapons is used only for that purpose.
On the diplomatic front, Russia's renewed bloody-mindedness should impel us to admit the Baltic nations to NATO. We should redirect our credits propping up Russia over to its southern neighbors Georgia and Azerbaijan.
Most tellingly, we should take up an idea being put forward by Zbigniew Brzezinski: Bring back the Group of Seven.
Because we wanted to encourage Russia to embrace democratic capitalism, the world's leading industrial nations invited Russia in -- thereby becoming the Group of Eight. This built up Yeltsin's prestige.
But Russia does not rate membership on the basis of its economy -- only on the basis of its potential as a civilized society. By virtue of its savage attack on civilians in Chechnya, the Yeltsin-Putin regime does not deserve membership in that informal league of the advanced industrial democracies.
Only when it stops killing innocent people for the purpose of improving poll ratings and remaining in power should that militarist regime be invited to a summit meeting of the Group of Seven.
The West cannot intervene militarily. But we're not helpless.

HEADLINE: Dutch Planning a Disco for Last Pilgrim Site

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: LEIDEN, the Netherlands, Nov. 24

 BODY:
The last vestiges of the Pilgrims' decade-long stay in the Netherlands face destruction to make room for a disco, shopping mall and parking garage.
The moss-adorned brick wall in the historic center of this Dutch town is all that remains of the Church of Our Lady, where the Pilgrims worshiped before they sailed to North America in 1620. 
 But if Leiden's city fathers have their way, there will be nothing left to mark the Pilgrims' sojourn here, where they thrived in an atmosphere of religious tolerance after fleeing England.
The church wall and the nearby site of a hospital where the Pilgrim leader Miles Standish recuperated from injuries he suffered while serving in the Dutch army are the only structures remaining from the Pilgrims' stay, according to Jeremy Bangs, an American expert on the Pilgrims.
The last Pilgrim house in the city, that of William Bradford, who became the first governor of Plymouth colony in Massachusetts, was torn down in 1985 to make way for a housing project.
Now, the two remaining Pilgrim monuments and 20 other medieval and 17th-century landmarks may share a similar fate to make room for a major urban redevelopment project proposed by the City Council.
"Once those building are gone, they're gone," said Mr. Bangs, former curator of Plimoth Plantation, the museum of Pilgrim history in Plymouth, Mass.
"The council has suggested putting up signs where the landmarks once stood, but what's the point if nothing is left," said Mr. Bangs, who now lives in Leiden.
Jan Vellekoop, head of the Monument Preservation Commission, defended the housing project, saying that some of Leiden's 1,300 historic sites have to be sacrificed so that the city can modernize.
"The city is a living organism and you can't stop time and keep everything in the 17th century because it was a nice time," Mr. Vellekoop said. "This is the 20th century, and there are new demands on the city to change and grow."
In a promotional brochure for the project, city officials say it will "give the heart of the city a new impulse" while "respecting the splendid monuments that are there."
Mr. Bangs accused the City Council of withholding information on the project and scheduling impromptu meetings about it to prevent protests. The city officials responsible for the project, Tjeerd van Rij and Alexander Pechtold, declined a request for comment.
Jaap Moggre, chairman of the neighborhood association nearest to the church square, said the city had refused to hear his group's objections, citing city ordinances that allow only residents whose homes directly overlook the plaza to file protests. "I pass by the church square almost every day, and it will be a great loss to the neighborhood if it's destroyed," Mr. Moggre said. "It's really a beautiful place."

France Again Rejects Coke Orangina Bid

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
After a two-year struggle with French regulators, the Coca-Cola Company was rejected yesterday for a second time in its bid to buy the Orangina soft drink brand from Pernod Ricard S.A., and a spokesman for Coca-Cola said the company regarded the decision as final.
The announcement from the French government came as a surprise because Coca-Cola had carefully reconstructed its original offer to satisfy officials of the competition council, who had turned the deal down in September of last year. The government's concern was that if Coke bought Orangina, it would control too much of the distribution network in France that other soft drink makers use. Among the companies that might have been affected was PepsiCo, which had lodged a complaint with the government. 
 The French finance minister, Christian Sautter, said the terms of the revised $733 million bid, in which Coca-Cola offered to exclude the distribution of Orangina in restaurants and other public places, did not do enough to allay concerns about market dominance. "The modifications of Coca-Cola's bid were not judged sufficient to meet all the guarantees needed in terms of competition," he said in Paris.
In a statement provided by a spokesman in Paris, Thierry Jacquillat, president of Pernod Ricard, said: "We share the disappointment of the entire staff of the Orangina company. This decision deprives them of legitimate ambitions and considerable means of development on the global market, and it is detrimental to the national economy."
Pernod Ricard must now seek a new buyer for Orangina, which it has said many times it wants to sell to concentrate on its other businesses, which include wine and spirits as well as fruit processing. A PepsiCo spokesman, Jeff Brown, refused to say whether the company would try to buy it, although he did applaud the French government for having "again established itself as one of the foremost defenders of fair competition."
"Today's decision will help preserve choice and fair pricing for French consumers," he added.
A spokesman for Coca-Cola said the company accepted the decision. "We're disappointed that the ministry has rejected the sale of Orangina, but we respect the government's final decision," said the spokesman, Rob Baskin. "We would have preferred a different outcome, but the minister's decision does not diminish our commitment to French consumers and our core French business."
Several industry experts noted that in the time that had elapsed since December 1997, when Coca-Cola's chairman and chief executive, M. Douglas Ivester, announced the Orangina acquisition for about $780 million, Coca-Cola had made other acquisitions that seem like better bargains. In particular, the purchase of the Cadbury Schweppes brands in most of the world outside the United States, for $1.1 billion, added far more volume to the Coca-Cola system than the Orangina deal would have. Orangina would have represented about 55 million cases a year; the Cadbury purchase accounts for about 400 million.
"It would have been nice for Coke to complete this transaction," said John D. Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, a trade newsletter. "But losing it is no big deal, by a long shot. The Cadbury deal is a lot bigger and a lot more consistent with Coke's strategy."
Still, the loss of Orangina was seen by one analyst as a blow to Coca-Cola's image, as well as to plans to expand Coca-Cola's influence in France, which has one of the lowest per-capita consumptions of Coke in Europe. "The curse on the Continent continues," said Jennifer Solomon, a beverage analyst for Salomon Smith Barney, referring to what has been a difficult year for Coca-Cola in Europe.
A huge recall in June cost the company and its bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, more than $100 million in revenue. Coca-Cola is also spending heavily on marketing to rebuild its reputation with consumers. European Commission regulators also raised problems that eroded part of the Cadbury deal, and there are continuing investigations of Coca-Cola's dealings in Italy, Germany and other parts of Europe.
"Two years is a long time for investors to wait for something to happen," Ms. Solomon said, noting that many investors had stopped worrying about whether the Orangina purchase would be completed. "But it's one more frustration for Ivester." Mr. Ivester announced the deal barely two months after taking over the top job from Roberto Goizueta, who died of cancer in October 1997.
On the other hand, with more than $700 million now freed up, Coca-Cola may resume its share buyback program, said another beverage analyst, Andrew J. Conway of Morgan Stanley. "The French competitive council's decision implies that Coke won't be able to significantly expand its brand in the next five years there," he said. "But this opens up more share repurchase opportunities." Coca-Cola halted the share buyback program earlier this year after credit agencies expressed worry about the company's profits in light of its other acquisitions.
Coca-Cola's earnings have been under pressure since economic crises around the world and other issues slowed the company's growth. After a sharp selloff this fall, its shares have risen drastically over the last week after announcements of much higher concentrate prices at both Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. The stock has also been helped by a Merrill Lynch analyst's report that predicted impressive earnings growth next year. Shares of Coca-Cola rose $1.305 yesterday, to $68.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Rate Worry Erodes Prices Of Treasuries

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury yields rose to four-week highs after the government raised its estimate of third-quarter growth, fueling concern that the Federal Reserve will need to raise interest rates to keep inflation in check.
"The bond market did not view this data favorably," said Alan Koepplin, who helps manage $2.5 billion at SG Cowen Asset Management. He has steered clear of shorter-maturity Treasuries, like two-year notes, which he said were "lagging because there's an impression the Fed will still have to raise rates," even after three increases since June. 
 The yield on two-year notes, among the securities most sensitive to Fed rate expectations, rose 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 5.94 percent.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 5/32 , to 98 31/32 . Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.20 percent from 6.19 percent.
Thirty-year bonds have given up almost two-thirds of their gains from a three-week rally that ended on Nov. 16, when the Fed warned that risks to sustainable growth persisted and raised rates.
The drop in Treasuries picked up speed after the government said the economy grew at a 5.5 percent annual pace in the third quarter, surpassing its previous estimate of 4.8 percent and exceeding analysts' forecasts for 5.1 percent. The report's inflation component rose 1.1 percent from nine-tenths of 1 percent.
"This data suggests growth is still stronger than the Fed is comfortable with," said Henry Willmore, an economist at Barclays Capital Inc. "It is going to be bearish for the market."
Demand for bonds also waned before the Thanksgiving holiday, with trading down 38.1 percent by noon in New York from the average Wednesday in the third quarter and 36.2 percent lower than the average Wednesday in the last month. The market closed at 2 p.m. yesterday and will be closed today.

HEADLINE: With President Gravely Ill, Croats Face Succession Issue

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Nov. 24

 BODY:
With Croatia's dominant political figure, President Franjo Tudjman, apparently on the brink of death, Parliament passed a constitutional amendment today that would allow the country to be governed in the meantime, with some of his duties passed on to the speaker of the Parliament.
Mr. Tudjman's doctors said today that his condition was grave, their most dire description yet in the three weeks since he entered the hospital for emergency intestinal surgery. There have been persistent rumors that Mr. Tudjman, who has stomach cancer, is being kept breathing artificially and is attached to life-support equipment while his divided party, the Croatian Democratic Union, figures out who will succeed him. Seeking to address those rumors, party officials said today that he was alive. 
 Mr. Tudjman is apparently unable to sign the documents for parliamentary elections, originally scheduled for Dec. 22, so the country is in a state of morbid expectation, reminding some people of the lingering, four-month death watch for Josip Broz Tito, the founder of Yugoslavia, who died in 1980.
Mr. Tudjman, 77, who has patterned his habits and his taste for uniforms on Tito's, is a historian and former Yugoslav Army general who pulled Croatia out of Yugoslavia in 1991, thereby helping to collapse the old Communist federation.
Mr. Tudjman has run Croatia as an autocrat since 1991 while winning repeated elections as its president, the last in 1997. But a pattern of economic corruption and cronyism, a disregard for human rights and a tight rein on the news media, especially television and radio, have brought Mr. Tudjman considerable criticism from Washington and the European Union.
In particular, the West would like the Croatian government to be more fully cooperative with the international war crimes tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague and to stop refusing to hand over people indicted as war criminals; to welcome, rather than discourage, the return to Croatia of Serbs driven from the country after Mr. Tudjman's forces recaptured the Serb-held territory in August 1995; and to hold free and fair elections with free and fair access granted to the news media.
Part of the political confusion here stems from the increasing unpopularity of Mr. Tudjman's umbrella party, since the economy is stagnant, corruption is visible and unemployment is very high. Reputable polls taken earlier this month indicated that an opposition grouping of center-left parties would probably win a majority in Parliament, although Mr. Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union -- universally known here by its Croatian initials HDZ -- would remain the largest party.
Originally, parliamentary elections were scheduled for Dec. 22 -- a pre-Christmas date that seemed designed, in this largely Roman Catholic country, to help his party, since many of its critics, including Croats who also have homes abroad, would be on vacation or out of the country. But Parliament's mandate expires on Saturday, and no solution is yet in sight for calling fresh elections.
Mr. Tudjman's death would leave his party divided into roughly three factions. The first is led by Ivic Pasalic, Mr. Tudjman's adviser. Mr. Pasalic has no state function but is considered instrumental in internal and security policy. He is the leader of the "Herzegovina lobby" that supports the Bosnian Croats, fervent devotees of Mr. Tudjman's party who are also allowed to vote in Croatian elections despite their Bosnian citizenship.
The second faction is led by the deputy speaker of Parliament, Vladimir Seks, a hard-line Croatian nationalist who announced today on television that Mr. Tudjman "is alive."
The third faction, more liberal and pro-European, is led by Foreign Minister Mate Granic, a favorite of Washington. While Mr. Granic is popular in the country, he is less so within the party.
The party, then, is thought to be trying to buy time while the leadership decides who will run for the presidency and when to call parliamentary elections. If Mr. Tudjman dies, the parliamentary speaker, Vlatko Pavletic, a relatively colorless figure, will run the country before new presidential elections within 60 days. Parliament's term is scheduled to expire on Jan. 27, and new elections should be called by Dec. 26 at the latest, to allow 30 days of campaigning.
But to have them during the Christmas break would require Mr. Tudjman -- or, if he is declared incapable, Mr. Pavletic -- to sign an order this week.
Today's Parliament vote was an indication of the confusion. The Constitution describes procedures in the case of a president's death, resignation or "permanent incapacity." But Mr. Seks said that the party "will under no circumstances agree to apply the institute of permanent incapacitation." To do so, he said, would be "immoral and disgraceful."
So in extraordinary session, Parliament passed, by a vote of 85 to 28 with 24 abstentions, a constitutional amendment that created a category of "temporary incapacity," which must be decided upon by the Constitutional Court when asked to do so by the Cabinet. But the law allows 30 days for the whole procedure, causing opposition politicians to protest that the political instability would simply continue.
The Parliament also voted to extend the mandate of the speaker, Mr. Pavletic, so he could serve after the legislature is dissolved on Saturday but before new elections are held. That would enable him to assume some of Mr. Tudjman's duties if he is declared temporarily incapacitated or dies.

HEADLINE: U.S. Missile Shield Will Set Off a New Arms Race, China Warns

BYLINE: By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 24

 BODY:
China's chief of arms control issued a new warning today that American plans for a national missile defense system, even if intended to stop attacks from countries like North Korea and Iraq, would set off a global arms race and cause more countries to develop nuclear weapons.
The existing Antiballistic Missile Treaty, which the United States proposes altering to allow limited defenses, has long been a cornerstone of nuclear stability, Sha Zukang, director of arms control and disarmament in China's foreign ministry, said today in an article in the official newspaper China Daily. 
 "Amending it in search of national missile defense will tip the global balance, trigger a new arms race and jeopardize world and regional stability," Mr. Sha wrote.
Russia has also been vociferous in opposing missile defenses.
China has objected to proposed theater missile defenses, local systems intended to protect American allies in Asia from missile attacks. China worries that such high-technology defenses would be offered to Taiwan, encouraging it to declare formal independence and cementing military ties between Taiwan and the United States.
Though the debate is already heated, theater defenses that could stop a blitz of short-range missiles are still in the unproved research stage.
But in today's article and recent speeches, Chinese officials have also vehemently challenged the progressing American plans for a national defense system, perhaps designed to stop a handful of incoming missiles.
A prime reason for Chinese concern, weapons experts say, is that even a limited system would undercut China's own nuclear strategy, forcing it to spend far more than it wants to build extra rockets and bombs and putting a drain on economic development.
Unlike the United States and Russia, each of which fielded thousands of nuclear weapons in a race for slim advantages, China has deployed small numbers of weapons intended simply to give adversaries second thoughts about attacking it.
Western analysts say China may have no more than two dozen long-range missiles capable of reaching parts of the United States with single warheads. China's theory is that if a prospective attacker believes that even one or two of China's missiles can get through to destroy a city, a nuclear attack will be deterred.
The Chinese know that their current aging, fixed-site missiles are vulnerable to a sudden attack and plan to replace them with more powerful missiles that are mobile and therefore far more difficult to take aim at.
Western officials do not know how many such missiles the Chinese plan to field. But even limited American defenses could reduce China's confidence that it could mount an effective counterattack in case of war. So China may feel that it needs a relatively larger force, perhaps including missiles that carry multiple warheads, to maintain its stature as a nuclear power.
Mr. Sha, in today's article and other speeches, does not mention such hard-nosed strategic concerns, only alluding darkly to a hastened arms race. In the article today, he also said an American missile defense would "undermine the conditions necessary for nuclear disarmament."
And without the promise of superpower arms reductions, he said, "who can guarantee that other non-nuclear states will not go nuclear?"

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Counters Critics of Its Cold War Work

BYLINE: By JAMES RISEN 

DATELINE: COLLEGE STATION, Tex., Nov. 20

 BODY:
After enduring a decade of second-guessing over whether it failed to detect Communism's impending demise, the Central Intelligence Agency is still a bit defensive about its performance in the waning years of the cold war.
But when the desire to set the historical record straight led the agency to cosponsor a conference on the subject with the George Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M University this weekend, the agency tried hard to produce a celebration of an intelligence victory. It even declassified 24 intelligence reports from the years 1988 to 1991 as proof that its assessments were more accurate than the critics have said. 
 Still, the conference could not ignore the harsh truth that some criticism of the agency's cold war reporting was well founded. In fact, its forecasts in the late 70's and early 80's were sometimes far off.
Although the agency began to detect signs of stagnation in the late 70's, it continued for years to overstate significantly the size and growth rate of the Soviet economy. The agency also badly understated the burden that military spending was placing on the Soviet economy and refused for years to accept evidence that Soviet production of nuclear missiles was not growing as rapidly as Washington had expected.
In 1985, for example, an outside panel of economists found that although the agency believed that the Soviet economy was about half the size of the American economy, the gross domestic product was no more than 30 percent of the United States output.
Charles Wolf, an economist at the RAND Corporation who was on the panel, recalled that the agency's estimates of the Soviet Union's annual economic growth were also significantly overstated, while its estimates of the economic burden of military spending were too low.
Douglas MacEachin, who headed the office of Soviet analysis in the 80's, acknowledged that the agency had moved too slowly to adjust its projections of military and strategic forces to reflect the worsening economic conditions. The projections of large increases in producing ballistic missiles, Mr. MacEachin said, were consistently too high until the late 80's.
Robert Gates, a former director of central intelligence, agreed, saying, "During the mid-80's, our projections of Soviet strategic forces were clearly too high."
In part, the overly hawkish forecasts of the missile buildup in the early 80's represented a bureaucratic response to intense pressure from the Reagan administration, which had called the Soviet Union an "evil empire."
Yet the estimates also stemmed from a natural inclination among experts to expect the Soviets to continue to act as they had in the past. The Soviets built up their strategic forces more quickly than the agency had anticipated in the late 60's and early 70's, and the agency expected that rapid pace to continue.
The agency did report accurately the growing signs of an economic slowdown in the late 70's and early 80's. But such reports were not welcome at the White House, said former intelligence officials who were at the conference. Some current and former intelligence officials recalled how the Reagan administration was furious with one report suggesting Soviet military spending had turned flat in the early 80's.
"They saw it as challenging the central thrust of their policy, a big U.S. defense buildup," recalled one former intelligence official who insisted on anonymity.
By the late 80's, the agency did accurately portray the growing instability in the Soviet Union, and it did so earlier and more clearly than the critics have suggested, a review of the newly declassified intelligence reports shows.
In December 1988, a national intelligence estimate, "Gorbachev's Economic Problems: The Challenges Ahead," said: "Gorbachev's efforts at reviving the Soviet economy will produce no substantial improvement over the next five years, although his efforts to raise consumer welfare could achieve some modest results. Soviet attempts to raise technology levels will not narrow the gap with the West in most sectors during the remainder of this century."
In September 1989, two months before the fall of the Berlin Wall, an intelligence assessment by the office of Soviet analysis at the C.I.A. predicted: "The unrest that has punctuated Gorbachev's rule is not a transient phenomenon. Conditions are likely to lead in the foreseeable future to continuing crises and instability on an even larger scale in the form of mass demonstrations, strikes, violence and, perhaps, even the localized emergence of parallel centers of power."
In April 1991, months before the unsuccessful coup against Mr. Gorbachev in August, an agency paper, "The Soviet Cauldron," warned that "explosive events have become increasingly possible."
On the espionage front, the record was also mixed until the final years of the cold war. The fears of the agency's longtime counterintelligence chief, James Jesus Angleton, who believed that every Soviet defector was a double agent, paralyzed operations until the 70's, when the agency finally began to recruit important agents in the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries.

HEADLINE: Boy Scouts Start Drive For Funds In Detroit

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, Nov. 24

 BODY:
In this city of more than a million people, there are just 20,000 boy scouts. But there is an unusual, $17 million effort afoot to increase that number.
With an executive at the General Motors Corporation who was an eagle scout leading the charge, the Detroit Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America has begun a drive to raise $10 million for inner city Scout troops and another $7 million to build a new camp for cub scouts and make improvements on a Boy Scout camp in nearby Metamora, Mich. 
 The fund-raising drive is notable not only for its size, but also because it would earmark most of the money for long-term goals. If successful, the campaign would create a $10 million trust fund for inner-city troops. Interest and investment income from the fund would pay for costs like camping gear and uniforms.
Philanthropy experts say the drive is ambitious. "For scouts in Detroit, that's a lot of money," said Stacy E. Palmer, editor of The Chronicle of Philanthropy.
Nonprofit groups are increasingly taking advantage of the strong economy to build nest eggs.
"Everybody is figuring out that this is the smartest way to raise money and not have to keep going back to your donors," Ms. Palmer said. "The general prosperity is making people think of the long term."
People, as well as money, are being solicited as part of the drive to increase the number of inner-city scouts here. Detroit's 1,200 Baptist churches and its 73 Roman Catholic parishes have pledged to use scouting as part of their youth ministries. And the Detroit branch is looking for up to 500 volunteers from businesses and community groups to serve as assistant troop leaders, said Chuck J. Lang, senior director of development for the Detroit Area Council.
While Mr. Lang knew of no larger initiative targeting inner-city youths for Boy Scout membership, and a national spokesman for the Scouts was unable to provide any information about fund-raising drives in other cities, Detroit's is not the only multimillion-dollar drive for donations. Scouting organizations in Houston, Cincinnati and Indianapolis have held large fund-raising drives in recent years.
There are slightly more than 100,000 scouts in the Detroit metropolitan area, with about 80,000 in the suburbs and 20,000 in the inner city, Mr. Lang said.
Businesses have been receptive so far. General Motors has pledged $1 million toward the $17 million goal.
"Kids who are involved in scouting get exposed to skills and values in scouting," said John F. Smith, general manager of G.M.'s Cadillac division and a former eagle scout, who is one of the organizers of the drive. "Lots of surveys indicate they are changed and changed for the better by that experience."
Mr. Smith added: "If you are a business interest, you could selfishly look at this as early-on training for employees. We know it makes a difference."
Other companies are likely to pledge money later, when the fund-raising effort gets into full swing next month.
DaimlerChrysler "definitely will participate, but right now we are still considering the contribution amount," said a spokeswoman, Curtrise Garner, who added that the company had given $50,000 to the Scouts in Detroit so far this year. A spokeswoman for the Ford Motor Company, Gwynne Irvin, said that "news from Ford may be forthcoming."
Some billboard owners have donated advertising space on billboards along some of Detroit's highways, and the advertising agency D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles has designed the advertisements without charge.

HEADLINE: Outspoken Chief Economist Leaving World Bank

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 24

 BODY:
Joseph E. Stiglitz said today that he would resign as the World Bank's chief economist after using the position for nearly three years to raise pointed questions about the effectiveness of conventional approaches to helping poor countries.
Mr. Stiglitz, who joined the World Bank in February 1997 after serving as chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said he would leave the bank at the end of the year and would soon return to his academic post at Stanford University. 
 His departure will remove from Washington perhaps the most outspoken voice in the debate over how rich countries can best aid economic development in poor and crisis-afflicted nations. Over the last two years in particular, Mr. Stiglitz had antagonized officials at the International Monetary Fund and within the Clinton administration by criticizing their response to the financial crisis in Asia and their strategy for encouraging the development of democratic capitalism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
Mr. Stiglitz said the decision to leave had been his. Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers praised Mr. Stiglitz as a "major creative and intellectual force," and administration officials said the United States had not sought Mr. Stiglitz's removal. Caroline Anstey, a spokeswoman for the World Bank, said Mr. Stiglitz had "absolutely not" been forced out, and the bank's president, James D. Wolfensohn, praised Mr. Stiglitz for having helped to move the institution "away from the so-called Washington consensus."
But Mr. Wolfensohn has suggested in the past that Mr. Stiglitz was too quick to second-guess the international aid agencies and the big industrial nations that control them. "I think that his recent things about Russia, in my judgment, are not wholly correct," Mr. Wolfensohn said during the bank's annual meeting this autumn. "I think to stand back later and say, 'If you'd done it my way everything would have been different,' is a little generous to yourself."
And Mr. Stiglitz made no secret today of feeling constrained in his ability to speak out as freely as he wished. He said he was looking forward to the unfettered freedom of expression afforded by his return to the academic world.
"Whenever you're in an organization there are some pressures," Mr. Stiglitz said in an interview. "I felt that it was important for my intellectual integrity to be able to express myself as forcefully as I thought was appropriate."
A liberal with a strong belief that governments and institutions have a significant role to play in economic development and that market forces cannot be counted on to deal with every problem, Mr. Stiglitz challenged the prevailing orthodoxy among policy makers in Washington.
He said that the monetary fund went overboard in Asia in demanding that the countries ensnared in the financial crisis cut their budgets, arguing that fiscal austerity sometimes extracted too high a price from poor people without generating a corresponding improvement in international economic confidence.
He took issue with the view held by the fund and the United States government that controls on the international flow of capital were counterproductive or impractical, saying that in some cases it was justified to restrict short-term flows of money in and out of a developing economy. He said industrialized countries sometimes pushed developing nations too fast to deregulate their financial systems.
And he suggested that the United States and the monetary fund had failed to acknowledge that their prescription for Russia -- quick privatization of state-owned industries, an end to state oversight of the economy, abolition of price controls and an opening up to the rest of the world -- had not produced the intended results and indeed had left many people worse off.
"Mr. Stiglitz has been a very strong advocate for the poor and the excluded, and he's been one of the best things in the World Bank in the last decade," said Seth Amgott, a spokesman for Oxfam, which promotes poverty-fighting policies. "He's also been very pointed and insightful in discussing the role of the I.M.F. We're not used to that kind of candor."
Mr. Stiglitz won few friends among economists and policy makers at the Treasury Department and the monetary fund. But his message was greeted enthusiastically in poor countries, and he said he was leaving the bank feeling that he had helped to stimulate a more vigorous debate about the policy prescriptions that wealthy nations impose on developing countries.
"On some of the specific issues, there has emerged really a broad consensus behind the views I took," Mr. Stiglitz said.
"There's a recognition that policies in East Asia were excessively contractionary on the fiscal side," he continued. "There's a recognition that capital market liberalization, in the absence of adequate regulatory structures, exposes countries to much higher risks. And on the debate about economies in transition, there's a general consensus that the issues I've been raising are the right issues, and that while no one has the answers, we're not going to get answers until we're willing to ask the questions."
Mr. Stiglitz had told friends recently that he intended to leave, and he informed Mr. Wolfensohn this morning of his decision. Mr. Wolfensohn said Mr. Stiglitz would continue to act as an adviser to him and Mr. Stiglitz would lead the search for a new chief economist.
Ms. Anstey, the bank's spokeswoman, said that asking Mr. Stiglitz to head the search committee was a signal of the institution's "intention to select someone who will continue the Wolfensohn-Stiglitz agenda" of focusing more on the needs of poor countries and less on more orthodox policies developed in Washington.
Mr. Stiglitz said his approach was built around two basic themes: giving more of a voice to poor nations in setting policy and recognizing the crucial role that government must play in economic development.
"We are rebalancing our thinking about the role of the state," Mr. Stiglitz said. "Some of the failures, like in East Asia, involve cases where government did too little, like in financial regulation, rather than too much."

HEADLINE: Reporter's Notebook;
Gore, Running in Iowa, Runs Hard From Clinton

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE 

DATELINE: COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa, Nov. 23

 BODY:
As Vice President Al Gore tries to sell himself as his own man, unencumbered by President Clinton and his scandals, it is hardly a surprise that he plays down his ties to the politician he hopes to succeed.
But Mr. Gore may be taking things to an extreme. He has has practically banned the dreaded "C word" from his vocabulary. In a campaign swing on Monday and today that brought him before several partisan audiences in southeastern Iowa and western Iowa and in a quick flight to Chicago for a fund-raising dinner, Mr. Gore mentioned the president only once -- and only because he did not have much choice. 
 At the event in Chicago, he was listing the administrations that had advocated a nuclear test ban treaty -- "Clinton, Carter, Bush and Reagan administrations" -- so he could not easily have excluded his own.
Sometimes, Mr. Gore goes through verbal contortions to avoid mentioning Mr. Clinton. At an open meeting of undecided Democratic voters today in this town on the western border of Iowa, one person stood up and asked Mr. Gore to describe the best thing that has happened to this country in his lifetime.
Mr. Gore's instinct was to blow the Clinton administration's horn -- and his own. But that was no easy trick given that he did not dare mention the president.
So, using fractured sentences and odd tenses, the vice president cited the administration's economic accomplishments but did not cite the administration. It was as if he took his old talking points and excised any mention of Mr. Clinton.
"Right now we have the strongest economy in the history of the United States," Mr. Gore said, citing the "end of the recession of the Reagan-Bush years" and "having 20 million new jobs."
The "pretend Clinton does not exist" approach seemed to work. The audience applauded, heartily, for Mr. Gore.
 
A Chairman on a Tightrope
When Mayor Edward G. Rendell of Philadelphia was installed as general chairman of the Democratic National Committee several weeks ago, some who back Mr. Gore's rival, former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, groused that Mr. Rendell had been a bit too friendly with the vice president.
The concern was that Mr. Rendell's past relationship with Mr. Gore would interfere with the custom that a party chairman is supposed to be neutral in a contested primary.
Mr. Bradley's backers would not have been heartened when Mr. Rendell introduced the vice president on Monday at a lavish fund-raising dinner in Chicago that raised about $700,000 for the national party.
At first, Mr. Rendell was even-handed. "We have two candidates who could both stand up and be president of the United States today," he said. "And they are right on the issues!"
Moments later, Mr. Rendell edged toward the Gore camp: "We also have, as I said, two good candidates -- but one who has served this country in a way that I think is unparalleled."
Mr. Rendell went on to recall that he had once described Mr. Gore as the best vice president in history. But then, not wanting to be accused of hyperbole, he scaled back his praise a bit, saying that "no question about it," he was the best No. 2 "in our lifetimes."
 
A Pop Quiz on Football
Brian Hansen, a retired civilian employee for the military, ambled up to Mr. Gore at the open meeting here and announced, "I have a pop quiz for you, sir."
The vice president visibly winced before managing a meek, "O.K."
Who could blame him? After Gov. George W. Bush of Texas flunked a pop quiz on foreign leaders earlier this month from a Boston television reporter, politicians are on the lookout.
Luckily for Mr. Gore, Mr. Hansen was only teasing. He asked him which team he favored for the national college football championship: Florida State, Nebraska or Virginia Tech.
It was hardly a stumper. When Mr. Hansen mentioned Nebraska, he stomped his foot. And Nebraska, of course, borders Iowa, so it was no surprise which team is the favorite in these parts.
It was an easy pander for the vice president. "Nebraska's looking good," Mr. Gore said.
 
A Bridge to Local Issues
Except when he steps off the stairs from Air Force Two, it is easy to forget these days that Al Gore is the understudy to the leader of the free world. On trips, he eschews the vice-presidential seal. And he eschews a tie (except at big-money fund-raisers like the one in Chicago). When he enters a room, no one announces, "The vice president of the United States."
But Mr. Gore may have gotten carried away with his "I'm just a man of the people" theme when he addressed members of a senior center in Fort Madison, in the southeast corner of Iowa. He sounded like Mayor Gore when he mentioned how he and the local Congressman, Leonard L. Boswell, had been chatting about repairs needed on a nearby bridge.
"Incidentally, Leonard's been talking to me about this bridge," Mr. Gore said. After describing how the lanes curved, Mr. Gore asked his audience, "Does that need to be changed?"
By tailoring his remarks for the locals, the vice president may have won some converts. But he also gave more fodder to Mr. Bradley, who likes to portray himself as the purveyor of big ideas.

HEADLINE: ECONOMY PROVING IT'S MORE ROBUST THAN ANTICIPATED

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
The long-running expansion of the American economy rolled into autumn with even more momentum than had been thought, and is poised to set a record for longevity with the arrival of the year 2000.
With employment, incomes, confidence and major stock market gauges at or near peaks, the Commerce Department raised its estimate yesterday of economic growth from July to September to an annual pace of 5.5 percent from 4.8 percent, surpassing nearly all predictions. 
 "How can you not be thankful?" asked James Glassman, chief United States economist at Chase Securities.
The report arrived with few signs of revived inflation. "This is not something you expect to see this late in the game," Mr. Glassman said.
But unless growth slows drastically, analysts fear the Federal Reserve could feel compelled to raise interest rates again and dampen the expansion, which is now eight and a half years old.
One source of anxiety is the fact that inflation is creeping up in the early stages of production, before products reach consumers. Consumers are already seeing the highest oil prices since the Persian Gulf war.
The latest consensus, according to Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a monthly survey of economic forecasters, is for gross domestic product to rise at a 4.1 percent pace in the current quarter and by 3 percent next year.
"Growth is going to be well above historical averages," said John M. Youngdahl, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs, which is forecasting a 4.5 percent growth rate in the final three months of 1999.
And stock prices keep rising. Yesterday, the technology-laden Nasdaq index sailed to a new peak that puts it 56 percent ahead for the year while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Dow Jones industrial average hovered near records.
While the government's latest snapshot of the $8.9 trillion economy covers only the third quarter, the growth rate and separate data for October and November were said to bode well for the holiday shopping season.
Consumer spending, which makes up about two-thirds of overall economic activity, rose at a 4.6 percent annual rate in the third quarter, initially reported as an increase of 4.3 percent.
The latest figures also advanced the likelihood that January will become the 107th consecutive month of economic growth, breaking the mark set between 1961 and 1969, when national output was bolstered by the Vietnam War.
In a separate report yesterday, the Labor Department said first-time claims for unemployment insurance tumbled 13,000 last week, to 274,000, the third decline in the past five weeks.
With stores gearing up for Christmas, this was further evidence that little or no slack has yet developed in the tautest labor market -- an unemployment rate of only 4.1 percent -- in a generation. On a four-week moving average, initial claims have now totaled less than 300,000 for 18 consecutive weeks, the longest string since 1973.
Consumer optimism is also high, with the University of Michigan's confidence index climbing to 107.2 in November from 103.2 in October, according to subscribers to its polling service. The index reflects consumers' positive assessment of current economic conditions and their optimism about the future.
What accounts for the extraordinary longevity of the 1990's expansion, which has seemed little affected so far by the Federal Reserve's three quarter-point increases in its interest-rate target since midyear?
One reason is accelerated productivity, which Chase economists say is translating into compensation gains that exceed the expectations of workers who had become accustomed to increases averaging only about one percentage point more than inflation. This, the bank said, fostered "a general level of satisfaction" that has helped encourage big rises in consumer spending.
Another factor, analysts said, was the foreign economic crisis in Asia and Russia in the second half of 1998, which funneled overseas capital to the safety of the American securities markets, helping, along with cuts by the Federal Reserve in 1998, to keep interest rates low.
This, in turn, contributed to the rise in American stock, bond and home prices, all of which sustained confidence and buying power.
Uncertainty over possible disruptions from computer failures, the so-called Year 2000 problem, prompted some producers and consumers to stockpile products, like medicines, or to replace hardware or software they otherwise might only have fixed. This accounts for at least some of the surge in capital investment and inventories, the latter one of the biggest factors in yesterday's upward revision in G.D.P.
Economists said they could not quantify the Year 2000 effect, however, suggesting it might be turning out to be less than expected. If so, there would presumably be little falloff in such demand early next year, as some have feared.
"It's hard to disentangle" the Year 2000 moves from other rebuilding of depleted inventories, Mr. Youngdahl of Goldman, Sachs said.
The largest positive factor in the upward revision of the gross domestic product was fewer imports, the Commerce Department report also showed, while the biggest drag was less production of equipment and software than first estimated.
As for inflation, the price index for gross domestic purchases edged up to 1.7 percent from 1.6 percent last month, which analysts regarded as trivial.
Yesterday's report also included the government's first estimate of corporate profits for the quarter, which on a current production basis rose $8.2 billion in the summer after falling $6.5 billion in the spring.
Current production cash flow, which adjusts for inventory valuation and capital consumption, rose $16 billion after a $6.7 billion decline in the previous quarter.
Profits were reduced by about $8 billion because of the effects of Hurricane Floyd, the department said, $6 billion of this in benefits paid by insurance companies and $2 billion from uninsured losses.

Clinton's Trade Policy Hampers Gore's Campaign
The Clinton administration's trade agreement with China and its support for global trade talks in Seattle next week are complicating Vice President Al Gore's efforts to energize labor behind his presidential campaign. Unions are worried that the lowering of trade barriers -- a major goal of the Seattle talks -- will make American products less competitive and encourage businesses to build plants overseas to take advantage of cheap labor. A28
 
'Pulling Rank' in the Cockpit
Investigators were drawn to Gamil al-Batouti, the relief pilot they suspect of crashing EgyptAir Flight 990, partly by the abrupt and assertive way he took over the co-pilot's seat a few minutes before the plane began its fatal dive, government officials said. A32
 
Indian Farmers Sue U.S.
Indian farmers and ranchers sued the Agriculture Department, alleging a 20-year history of discrimination in the granting of loans. The lawsuit parallels a case brought by black farmers, which was settled this year at an estimated cost of $2 billion. A22
 
EDUCATION
 
Move Against Behavioral Drugs
The Colorado Board of Education has passed a resolution -- the first of its kind in the country -- meant to discourage teachers from recommending prescription drugs like Ritalin and Luvox to counter problem behavior in the classroom. Proponents of the measure said they were motivated by evidence linking psychotropic drugs to some violent school crimes, an assertion disputed by mental health experts. A1

HEADLINE: Keep Trucking Safe

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Re "In a Nonstop Economy, Truckers Keep Rolling" (news article, Nov. 24): These may be good times for truckers, but they aren't necessarily good times for the motorists who share the highways with them. More than 5,300 people died in truck crashes on United States highways last year. As you report, truckers routinely speed and break rules. 
 Fortunately, last week, Congress approved a bill to create a new Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration to oversee truck safety. The bill requires that safety must be the new agency's highest priority. The legislation is a good first step, but it should not be the final step. It is crucial that the person appointed to manage the new agency be knowledgeable about safety and wholly independent from the trucking industry.

HEADLINE: ON THE ROAD;
A Southern Legacy and a New Spirit

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr. 

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, S.C.

 BODY:
You can't say it about many cities, but you can say it about this one: One man changed its destiny.
His name is Joseph P. Riley Jr. He is Charleston's mayor. He halted its long decline, which lasted for a hundred years after the Civil War, turning it from a proud but rotting relic into a model modern city. After 24 years on the job, in an era of pervasive skepticism about politicians, he was elected to a seventh term on Nov. 9 with 71 percent of the vote.
Even the cabbies believe in him. One old-timer told me, "I'd bet my life that he's never stolen a nickel or cheated a soul." 
 Mayor Riley has had help, of course: from a business community galvanized into action when the 95-year-old Charleston Naval Base was closed in 1996; from a devoted band of preservationists determined to restore the beauties of antebellum Charleston; from an unconventional police chief, Reuben Greenberg, a black Jew with two degrees from Berkeley whose Deep South brand of tough love has slashed the crime rate and forged better race relations; and from Gian Carlo Menotti, who rejuvenated the city's cultural life when he established an American version of his Spoleto festival here.
The mayor has also been helped a lot by history. Charleston is steeped in it, and tourists flock here to trace its footprints in the jasmine-scented streets and aristocratic houses. They admire the porches, called piazzas, positioned to catch ocean breezes, and the Mediterranean interplay of light, sea and shade, and the narrow gardens, full of boxwood, old roses and neat brick paths. A few may recall the watchwords of the beloved Emily Whaley, whose blossom-filled plot at 58 Church Street measures only 30 feet by 100 feet: "Early to bed, early to rise, work like hell and fertilize."
They visit the ruined Fort Sumter, toward which Confederate gunners under the grandiloquently named Gen. Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard directed the first shots of the Civil War on April 12, 1861. They sit in the box pews at St. Michael's Episcopal Church, finished in 1761, where George Washington and Robert E. Lee both came to pray. Its noble white steeple, a near replica of the one at St. Martin's-in-the-Fields in London, may well have been designed by the same architect, James Gibbs. They stroll past the rice planters' Italianate and Greek Revival mansions along the Battery, the tourists do, and gaze out upon the point where, as the natives like to say, the Ashley River meets the Cooper to form the Atlantic Ocean.
They buy the baskets, made from dried sweetgrass, sold by elderly African-American women with soft Sea Island accents at the corner of Broad and Meeting Streets. And they tuck into the updated Dixie cooking, unashamedly rich and sweet, of restaurateurs like Louis Osteen, whose homely fried peach pie with butter pecan ice cream makes you forget Escoffier's peach Melba.
While they are here, the visitors account for a third of Charleston's economy. There is money in those old buildings, which Charleston was once "too poor to paint, too proud to whitewash," and in those oh-so-courtly Southern ways, which year after year win Charleston the No. 1 position on a list of Most Mannerly Cities in America compiled by Marjabelle Young Stewart, an etiquette expert.
Wiser travelers come in spring and fall, for Spoleto and the house and garden tours, avoiding the long, suffocating days of summer.
But Charleston seldom seems crowded or hurried, regardless of season. Life ambles along with all the speed and urgency of a drawl. This is a small city, centered on a narrow peninsula, with only 75,000 people, though the metropolitan area is several times that. Think Norwalk, Conn.
The scale is human. The streets are clean, free of graffiti and litter; motorists, except for the occasional surly outsider, rarely honk their horns. You can stroll down Ropemaker's Lane or Price's Alley, leaving the 20th century far behind, yet this is a real city, a living community, not a museum like Williamsburg.
 
'A Vast Cousinage'
I suppose that at this point I should declare an interest, as British politicians say. My wife's maiden name was Betsey Pinckney, and she comes from the storied clan that more or less invented Charleston. Two of her forebears signed the Constitution; one of them, Charles Pinckney, later served as minister to Spain; the other, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, was named envoy to France and ran unsuccessfully as the Federalist nominee for president (twice) and vice president. Charles Cotesworth's brother, Thomas, served as minister to England. All three fought in the Revolutionary War.
The 18th-century Low Country elite was "a vast cousinage," one prominent historian has written, a hugely prosperous extended family. In 1774 the per capita wealth of Charleston and the Low Country was four times that of the Virginia plantations, six times that of New York City.
They say that Charlestonians are like the Japanese, in that they eat rice and worship their ancestors, and I admit that the Pinckney-tude of Charleston used to get my goat: Pinckney Street, Pinckney Island and Castle Pinckney, and graveyards full of Pinckneys. Betsey once rode in a carriage pulled by a horse named Charles Cotesworth Pinckney.
But Eliza Lucas Pinckney won me over. Born in Antigua, the daughter of a colonial governor, she married the first Charles Pinckney in 1744. In short order she bore three children (including Charles Cotesworth and Thomas), compiled one of the very first colonial recipe books and took over the management of several large plantations, where she taught many slaves to read and write. Most important, she introduced the cultivation of indigo to the state. It was a crop so valuable to the British textile industry for dyes that it made South Carolina a favored child of the mother country.
Like many of the early settlers, the Pinckneys came from England by way of Barbados. Others came directly from Britain and France. These last were almost all Huguenots, or French Calvinists, and their tradition lives on in names like Manigault and Huger (pronounced you-GEE).
The piazza, which on many houses functions as an outdoor room, is an adaptation of a Barbadian architectural style; in this particular form, it is found only in Charleston. St. James's, an Episcopal church that also draws on West Indian traditions, survives in the northern suburb of Goose Creek, all but hidden in a copse of trees. (Inquire locally.) The pale pink stucco building, without a steeple, has a dozen fine Palladian windows and, in a pediment over the main door, a relief of a pelican nourishing its young, the symbol of the missionary Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.
Built about 1713, set in a walled graveyard overhung with live oaks, the church still displays George I's coat of arms behind the pulpit.
 
Architectural Echoes
The planters who lived around Goose Creek and along the Low Country rivers maintained ties to Britain for generations. In 1715 Palladio's treatise on classical styles was first published in England, and 30 years later John Drayton built a porticoed plantation house on the Ashley whose Tuscan and Ionic columns come directly from Palladio's pages.
Drayton Hall still stands; alone among the great houses in its neighborhood, it was spared by General Sherman's soldiers because, it is said, the owner had his slaves tell the federal troops that the house was being used as a smallpox hospital. Never converted to central heating or electric lights, and painted only twice, the interior of the house retains its elaborate original architectural details and elegant plaster moldings and ceilings.
Boone Hall, with a famous half-mile allee of live oaks planted in 1743, is a 1935 re-creation of the original. Cypress Gardens and Magnolia Gardens, both laid out amid blackwater swamps, are set alight by a riot of camellias and azaleas every spring. Medway Plantation, on the Cooper, was built in 1705 and is probably the oldest brick building in the state. It is privately owned and open only occasionally for the garden tours.
But it is Middleton Place, marvelous Middleton, that always lures us out of the city on fine days. Its manor house is a ruin; only one small flanking building survives, and it has been much altered. Never mind. It is filled with family portraits by Benjamin West, valuable silver, 18th-century beds with posts carved to resemble rice stalks and other furniture from the workshop of Thomas Elfe, Charleston's most noted cabinetmaker.
Bookshelves and tables hold rare first editions by Catesby and Audubon, who came here to draw the ospreys and egrets that still nest in local marshes. Audubon formed a friendship with Joel Poinsett, an erudite Charleston-born diplomat, who brought the Christmas plant named for him to this country from Mexico.
Henry Middleton began to plot his classical gardens in 1741. Now grown to mellow maturity, they are anchored by a pair of lakes shaped like a butterfly's open wings, which lie just below a series of scalloped terraces. On another part of the plantation a flock of sheep grazes quietly. A pathway leads beneath arching camellia bushes that carpet it in pink in early March. And everywhere there are stupendous trees -- gums, magnolias, crape myrtles -- and a mighty oak, a marker on an Indian trail before Columbus reached America. The oak has reached a circumference of 30 feet and a spread of 145.
It took 100 slaves 10 years to lay out the parterres, the terraces, the canals and the rest of the rigorously geometric design. To my mind they created the greatest garden that we have from Colonial America.
 
The Role of the Blacks
Slavery and its legacy, white supremacy, hung over Charleston like a pall for generations.
The French author Simone de Beauvoir came here in 1947. She was bewitched by the place, especially the Spanish moss, exulting in her journal that "it is the color of smoke, the color of amber and twilight." But the plantations haunted her.
"Creating those private Edens, which are as extravagant as the Alhambra," she wrote a few pages later, "required the vast wealth of planters and the hell of slavery; the delicate petals of the azaleas and camellias are stained with blood."
Between 1700 and 1775, the peak years of the slave trade, 40 percent of the Africans brought to America in chains passed through Charleston. Ever since, blacks have formed a big portion of the city's population.
DuBose Heyward's 1925 novel, "Porgy," transformed by George Gershwin into the folk opera "Porgy and Bess" in 1935, portrayed the lives of some of the poorest of them, who lived on Church Street in the onetime slave dependencies of houses on Cabbage Row, or Catfish Row, as Heyward renamed it. The city's blacks gave another gift to Broadway, the kinetic dock workers' dance that was transformed into the Charleston for "Runnin' Wild," a 1923 hit.
Happily, Charleston has moved well beyond its darkest days, and in casting off the shroud of white supremacy it has gradually begun to remember and to acknowledge the black role in its history. The other half of the story is displayed for visitors in the slave quarters at Boone Hall and the Aiken-Rhett House downtown.
The College of Charleston's Avery Research Center delves into the African-American past, maintaining collections of manuscripts and papers, including the records of the 54th Massachusetts Regiment, the black unit that mounted the heroic assault on Fort Wagner depicted in the Civil War film "Glory." That battle, in which the 54th's commander, Robert Gould Shaw, lost his life, is fully described at the wonderful Charleston Museum.
 
Accounts of Progress
But the process is just beginning. Important moments of black history remain submerged. The plaque at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church on Calhoun Street says simply, "Founded 1818, closed 1822, reopened 1865." What heartbreak lurks behind that simple word "closed"! The church was closed because it had been burned down by a white mob in revenge for the actions of Denmark Vesey, a parishioner who tried to foment a slave uprising.
Mayor Riley told me that economic opportunity had provided the key to the dramatic improvement in relations between the races in his city.
"You make the table bigger," he said when we met in his office, which was piled high with files, newspapers and official documents. "You don't tell some people that they have to leave. We've made progress in housing, in police work, in guaranteeing the full participation of all our citizens in the affairs of the city council. But you can never relax. In a diverse society, there are always a lot of opportunities for misunderstanding, so you have to be sure that new bridges are built and old ones are maintained."
Mr. Riley has pioneered "scatter-site" public housing in an effort to combat the ghetto mentality. He has passed ordinances banning T-shirt shops, neon and tour buses in the historic district and hotels on the waterfront, lest the very element that brings visitors to Charleston, its charm, be submerged in tourist tattiness. He has built things that appeal to locals and visitors, rich and poor, like a brand-new Waterfront Park, which helped to revive a crumbling old port district, and a new minor-league ballpark. On King Street an old movie theater has been turned into a convention hall, a new Saks Fifth Avenue has opened nearby and a former bank now houses a Starbucks.
What sets Mr. Riley apart from run-of-the-mill mayors is a genuine passion for his work. He is -- dare we use the word in this cynical era? -- a true visionary, and it is his vision of a city reborn that has carried him and Charleston through nightmares like Hurricane Hugo in 1989, which damaged 90 percent of the city's roofs and made a shambles of businesses.
 
A Loss, Then a Surge
The closing of the naval base, Mr. Riley said soon after it happened, "was like death, because no one had ever imagined life in Charleston without the Navy." The city's longtime Congressman, L. Mendel Rivers, had poured Pentagon dollars into the city for decades; his slogan was, "Rivers Delivers." But the city not only survived the blow, it surged rapidly ahead.
"We're way on the plus side by now," said Ben Cole, the president of the Charleston Regional Development Alliance. "We lost about 22,500 jobs when the Navy left. Since then we've gained around 35,000 new ones."
The alliance, founded in February 1995, brought capital investments of more than $1.75 billion to the area in its first three years of existence, and it has kept up that pace. Ninety new companies have arrived, a third of them foreign, lured by the climate, the mostly nonunion labor force and above all the booming port.
Charleston, quaint little Charleston, is now the largest container port in the South and second only to New York on the east coast. There are plans afoot to make it much bigger by building port installations on Daniel Island, northeast of the city, but that worries conservationists.
 
Houses as Monuments
Meanwhile the restoration of old Charleston continues apace. At the moment scaffolding obscures the Market Hall, a little Doric temple that stands at the head of the city's public market, and the Fireproof Building, designed in 1826 by Robert Mills as a county records office. A draftsman for Thomas Jefferson at Monticello, Mills became South Carolina's greatest architect, building courthouses and churches, including the First Baptist on Church Street in Charleston, in a severe Classical Revival style. He later designed the Treasury and the Washington Monument in Washington.
A favorite of mine in the same style, though not by Mills, is the Hibernian Hall on Meeting Street, a chaste white structure with a gilded harp above the door, across from the Fireproof Building. It was designed by Thomas U. Walter, who also went on to greater architectural glory in Washington, designing the dome of the Capitol. Since the years after the Civil War the hall has been the site, on the third Thursday in January, of the annual St. Cecilia Ball, Charleston's oldest, most exclusive social function.
When they say "exclusive" in Charleston, they mean it. The right to attend is inherited. A favorite local put-down, Betsey's cousin Jane Hanahan told us, is to say of someone, "He doesn't go to the ball." To which Betsey's irreverent brother Tom replied, "It's the only thing left, now that the House of Lords is gone."
Portraits of the ancestors of today's ballgoers can be seen at the Gibbes Museum of Art, whose collection includes important works by Samuel F. B. Morse, Gilbert Stuart and Thomas Sully. The gem of the collection is an unforgettable image of John C. Calhoun, the ardent champion of states' rights, by Rembrandt Peale.
But the real monuments to the men and women who built Charleston are their houses, no fewer than 3,500 of them built before 1860. Two that should not be missed are the Nathaniel Russell House, with an oval staircase that vaults upward with no visible means of support, and the Heyward-Washington House, whose pine floors and cypress paneling date from 1772. Its unmatched collection of Charleston furniture includes a chest-on-chest-on-chest, one of only three in existence. Try to peek at the Sword Gates at 32 Legare Street, too, and the elegant Miles Brewton House, with a two-story portico.
 
Performance Time
When you have had your fill of houses, there are plays at the Dock Street Theater, where the Charleston Stage Company presents 120 performances a year, and at the Footlight Players' intimate 240-seat house. The Charleston Symphony, for which Mr. Riley dreams of building a proper hall one day, has attracted soloists of the caliber of Itzhak Perlman and Sherrill Milnes.
But it is at festival time that the city comes culturally alive. Next year's Spoleto Festival, accompanied by its "fringe," known as Piccolo Spoleto, is scheduled for May 26 through June 11. It will include new productions of Verdi's "Luisa Miller," directed by Christopher Alden, and Gluck's "Iphigenie en Tauride," directed by Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser, and the choreographer Mats Ek's profoundly radical "Swan Lake."
In late September comes the Mojo Arts Festival, a celebration of African-American and Caribbean art, with a rich array of jazz, gospel and storytelling. Another part of Charleston's enthusiastic rediscovery of itself.
 
A Stay in Charleston
 
Charleston is 763 miles south of New York City. Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel information:
 
Where to Stay
 
CHARLESTON PLACE, 130 Market Street, (843) 724-8410. With a prime location, two top-flight restaurants and an indoor-outdoor rooftop pool, this 450-room sister ship of Venice's Cipriani easily tops the roster of Charleston hotels. The bustling lobby, dominated by a huge white Murano chandelier, is the city's crossroads. But too many little things misfire: front-desk phones go unanswered after 25 rings, for example, and bathroom lights are placed so the makeup-applier's or shaver's face is cast into shadow. Double room: $175 to $395.
PLANTERS INN, 112 North Market Street, (843) 722-2345. Nothing is more characteristic of Charleston than the piazza or veranda overlooking a brick-paved, palmetto-shaded courtyard. The Planters Inn has both, plus high-ceilinged rooms, many with four-poster beds, and a warmly welcoming attitude at the reception desk. The inn belongs to the well-regarded Relais & Chateaux group, and it offers all the modern electronic paraphernalia. Double room: $175 to $225.
WENTWORTH MANSION, 149 Wentworth Street, (843) 853-1886. It was built by a cotton merchant in the Gilded Age and looks it. Crystal chandeliers, tile and marble floors, carved paneling and Tiffany-style windows give the place an air of tasteful opulence. Each of the 21 rooms has a CD player, a big-screen television, a fireplace and lots of antiques; many have Jacuzzis, and the suites are seignorial. Sweeping views from the rooftop cupola. Double room: $275 and $375.
HARBOUR VIEW INN, 2 Vendue Range, (843) 853-8439. Despite the mock-English spelling of its name, the Harbour View really does have harbor views. Only 15 months old, it is just across the street from the arching fountains of Charleston's handsome new Waterfront Park. And the 52 agreeably furnished rooms are rather gently priced. Double room: $129 weekdays; $179 weekends.
 
Where to Eat
 
HOMINY GRILL, 207 Rutledge Avenue, (843) 937-0930, is as unpretentious as they come -- a former barbershop with clapboard walls and butcher paper on the tables -- but everyone in town knows how good and how fairly priced it is. One day not long ago, two pickups and a Rolls-Royce were parked outside. Try shrimp and grits or toasted banana bread for brunch, a pimento cheese sandwich with arugula (!) for lunch, Southern fried chicken with spiced peach sauce for dinner. Robert Stehling, the chef, earned his stripes in Chapel Hill, N.C., from Bill Neal, a culinary legend in the New South.
LOUIS'S, 200 Meeting Street, (843) 853-2550. Some people like Adam Tihany's hip decor and some don't (this is Charleston, after all), but nobody doesn't like Louis Osteen, a sweet-natured country boy with a golden touch at the stove. He blends Europe with the South in black-eyed pea cassoulet and sweetbreads braised with Madeira, Vidalia onions and country ham. Other dishes speak pure Carolina, like oyster stew with benne (sesame) seeds and pork porterhouse with corn bread dressing. It is all meltingly delicious, and Mrs. Osteen, Marlene, has chosen 350 pedigreed wines to go with it.
MAGNOLIAS, 185 East Bay, (843) 577-7771. Magnolias is always packed. With good reason; Donald Barickman, the clever chef, produces a host of crowd-pleasers like Down South egg rolls, stuffed with chicken, collard greens and spicy tasso ham, and fried green tomato B.L.T.'s. Bright paintings, ancient pine floors and a mix of locals and tourists enhance the casual mood.
PENINSULA GRILL, in the Planters Inn (see above), (843) 723-0700. A cosmopolitan, subtly lighted room with velvet walls, the grill delighted me with foie gras served with duck rillettes and peach jam, and a veal chop with cheesy, peppery grits. It let Betsey down with over-the-hill oysters and overbreaded sweetbreads. But the smiling service, the superb wines and the memorable five-layer coconut cake more than tipped the balance.
SLIGHTLY NORTH OF BROAD, 192 East Bay Street, (843) 723-3424. Like a lot of Charleston restaurants, S.N.O.B., as it's known locally, is a bit inconsistent. Saucing can be heavy-handed. But its mixed grill of quail, homemade sausage and apple-smoked bacon over cabbage is a winner.
WOODLANDS, 125 Parsons Road, Summerville, (843) 875-2600. Ken Vedrinski produces the closest thing to haute cuisine in the Low Country at this inn 30 minutes from Charleston. The regional accent is muted, with turbotin and skate displacing shrimps and crab meat. But don't go on Sunday: Woodlands serves a limited menu, and no wine at all, on the sabbath.

 BODY:

Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings and running times are in parentheses. An index of reviews of films opening today appears on Page 14.
 
Now Playing
 
* "AMERICAN BEAUTY," starring Kevin Spacey, Annette Bening, Chris Cooper, Wes Bentley and Thora Birch. Written by Alan Ball. Directed by Sam Mendes (R, 116 minutes). With heavenly finesse, Mr. Spacey plays a buttoned-down 42-year-old suburbanite who flips his lid for a teenage cheerleader. And he never gets it back on. The midlife crisis motif is familiar, but the stage director Sam Mendes brings terrific visual flair and dry humor to this barbecuing of the bourgeoisie. All the actors display coolly expert timing, especially Ms. Bening as the antihero's grasping wife. Although the story spreads itself thin among many characters, the film coalesces for a devastating finale (Janet Maslin). 

* "THE BUENA VISTA SOCIAL CLUB," with Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay Segundo and Ry Cooder. Directed by Wim Wenders (not rated, 106 minutes). When the American guitarist and producer Ry Cooder assembled a group of all-but-forgotten Cuban musicians to record an album, no one expected that the record would become a phenomenon, selling more than a million copies worldwide and revitalizing the Cuban music scene. Mr. Wenders's ebullient documentary follows the group on tour from Amsterdam to New York and includes interviews with the group's main members. The music pulsates, and the pictures of Havana compare the city's grand but faded architecture with the musicians' weather-beaten faces (Stephen Holden).
 
* "AMERICAN MOVIE," featuring Mark Borchardt and friends. Directed by Chris Smith (R, 104 minutes). An insightful, funny, not-to-be-missed documentary about a no-budget Wisconsin filmmaker who makes a horror film as if his life depended on it. And as Mr. Smith so affectingly reveals, Mr. Borchardt's hopes really do hang in the balance. This knowing and often hilarious look at try-anything indie filmmaking becomes a moving portrait of one man's uphill struggle and finds Mr. Borchardt often describing success and prosperity as his goals. Meanwhile his own life is eloquently presented as a very different, no less authentic kind of American Dream (Maslin).
 
* "ANYWHERE BUT HERE," starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman. Directed by Wayne Wang (PG-13, 113 minutes). In a knowing film adaptation of Mona Simpson's widely praised, if not often wildly eventful, first novel, Ms. Sarandon is show-stopping as the 14-year-old heroine's mother and main nemesis. And Ms. Portman, who proves her mettle in a fully formed dramatic role, does a terrific job of holding her own in the film's battle of wills. Even when the material meanders, Mr. Wang supplies insightful, affectionate direction, just as he did for "The Joy Luck Club." A women's picture made with feeling and acted with great flair (Maslin).
 
* "BEING JOHN MALKOVICH," starring John Cusack, Catherine Keener, Cameron Diaz and (of course) John Malkovich. Written by Charlie Kaufman and directed by Spike Jonze (R, 112 minutes). Welcome to the fun house: in this exhilaratingly quirky first feature by a stellar video director, the reigning fears and obsessions of a technology-crazed, voyeuristic culture are given an even wilder workout than they got from "The Truman Show." Mr. Cusack plays a discouraged puppeteer who accidentally finds a way into Mr. Malkovich's mind. While the ordinary science-fiction plot might go downhill after revealing its gimmick, this one's inspired craziness goes on and on. Originality and cleverness abound (Maslin).
 
"THE BACHELOR," starring Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger. Directed by Gary Sinyor (PG-13, 90 minutes). This crude, frantic yuppie farce stars Mr. O'Donnell as a selfish, marriage-shy bachelor who botches his proposal to his sweetheart (Ms. Zellweger) days before his grandfather dies and leaves him $100 million on the condition he marry before his 30th birthday. That gives him 27 hours either to win back his true love or find another wife. After running through his ex-girlfriends, he finds himself besieged by a horde of prospective brides chasing him through the streets of San Francisco. Based on a 1925 Buster Keaton classic, the movie lands a few satiric thrusts at the money-mad workaholic 90's (Holden).
 
"THE BEST MAN," starring Taye Diggs, Morris Chestnut, Nia Long and Harold Perrineau. Directed by Malcolm D. Lee (R, 118 minutes). This feel-good ensemble film turns Mr. Diggs into a spectacled but hunky novelist en route to a friend's wedding. There he finds temptation in the form of an old flame and a lot of genial guy talk about the meaning of marriage. No problem here is too complicated to be settled by a good-humored dance scene. Another demonstration that current movies about upscale black characters have much more solid traditional values than ones about catty white teenagers (Maslin).
 
"THE BONE COLLECTOR," starring Denzel Washington and Angelina Jolie. Directed by Phillip Noyce (R, 118 minutes). One of the year's most gruesome movies, the ingenious but preposterous whodunit stars Mr. Washington as a quadriplegic forensic detective tracking down a serial killer who plays cat and mouse with him by leaving elaborate clues at the crime scenes. Ms. Jolie is the police officer (and former model) whom he instructs by cell phone on how to gather evidence. Crammed with the usual manipulative jolts, this urban creepshow at least succeeds in sustaining an atmosphere of menace, and Mr. Washington's and Ms. Jolie's star chemistry smolders without the two exchanging so much as a kiss (Holden).
 
* "BOYS DON'T CRY," starring Hillary Swank and Chloe Sevigny. Directed by Kimberley Pierce (R, 114 minutes). This stunning debut feature tells the strange and resonant story of Brandon Teena, who despite being born Teena Brandon went on to create a charismatic identity as a young man. Brandon's ultimately wrenching tale may sound tabloid-ready, but on screen it turns into Theodore Dreiser's idea of American tragedy. The film makes it hauntingly real and even tenderly romantic, with the astonishing acting needed to make it work. One of the year's best (Maslin).
 
"BRINGING OUT THE DEAD," starring Nicolas Cage and Patricia Arquette. Written by Paul Schrader from a novel by Joe Connelly. Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 115 minutes). An intense, volatile film full of sorrow and wild, mordant humor. This time it took prop garbage on the streets of Hell's Kitchen to create a sufficiently hellish ambience for another nighttime tour of Manhattan. But Mr. Scorsese has mellowed significantly since his "Taxi Driver" days, and his uneven but impassioned, visually inventive new film is more contemplative than it looks. Mr. Cage gives a fine, soulful performance as a New York ambulance driver haunted by ghosts. Ving Rhames is a major scene-stealer as one of his partners (Maslin).
 
* "DOGMA," starring Matt Damon, Ben Affleck, Linda Fiorentino, Chris Rock and Salma Hayek. Directed by Kevin Smith (R, 130 minutes). Mr. Smith's idea of angels in America is the notion of two cool dudes who take a hair-splitting, legalese approach to Roman Catholic doctrine and think it would be amusing to nullify all existence. And nothing in this wildly brazen, unexpectedly devout comedy is any less outrageous than that. Mr. Smith again shows off a rare gift for fusing his comic-book sensibility with serious debates and big, big laughs, even if some parts of his film (Ms. Fiorentino's performance, Mr. Rock's and semi-repartee from the ubiquitous Jay and Silent Bob) work better than others (an excrement monster). Making a gutsy leap into matters of faith, Mr. Smith miraculously emerges with his humor intact and his wings unsinged (Maslin).
 
"DOUBLE JEOPARDY," starring Ashley Judd, Tommy Lee Jones and Bruce Greenwood. Directed by Bruce Beresford (R, 106 minutes). In a touristy thriller that roams from the coastline of Washington State to the French Quarter of New Orleans, Ms. Judd plays a woman who is free to kill her husband because she has already gone to prison for the crime (see title). Not even she is beautiful enough to get away with rote acting and a far-fetched plot, but she perks up as her character becomes less of a victim. In this coed homage to "The Fugitive," Mr. Jones is on hand as another weathered sourpuss with a knack for barking orders. Mr. Beresford directs so unremarkably that it takes a line like "I feel like I've grown in the last six years" to signal the passage of time (Maslin).
 
* "FELICIA'S JOURNEY," starring Elaine Cassidy and Bob Hoskins. Directed by Atom Egoyan (PG-13, 116 minutes). In the brilliantly realized surreal thriller, adapted from William Trevor's popular novel, Felicia (Ms. Cassidy), a pregnant Irish girl searching for her boyfriend in the English midlands, is befriended by Joseph Hildritch (Mr. Hoskins), a catering manager who also happens to be a serial killer. Mr. Egoyan, Canada's most gifted filmmaker, elevates this cat-and-mouse game into a film that transcends genre by entering the characters' consciousness and implying a world of half-discernible connections in which the weather, the landscape and the chance encounters of strangers suggest the sense of a grand design (Holden).
 
"FLAWLESS," starring Robert De Niro and Philip Seymour Hoffman. Written and directed by Joel Schumacher (R, 110 minutes). Mr. De Niro is a retired New York City policeman recovering from a stroke and Mr. Hoffman the drag queen upstairs who gives him speech therapy in the form of singing lessons in this stridently campy comedy. Their flashy performances can't add dimension to a movie that is a message-laden duet for two caricatures, a homophobe and the angry, self-loathing drag queen who gets him out of his depression (Holden).
 
"HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL," starring Geoffrey Rush, Taye Diggs and Peter Gallagher. Directed by William Malone (R, 115 minutes). If the ever vigilant Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, is truly determined to snuff out inflation aborning, then he can do no better than to take sharpened pencil in hand, make his way to the nearest theater showing this film and strike fearlessly until its feeble pulse beats no more. This is a sorry reincarnation of the 1950's William Castle horror film in which an eccentric millionaire played by Vincent Price offered five strangers $10,000 each to spend the night in a spooky old mansion. In the new version the ante for survival has been raised to $1 million apiece. Even allowing for inflation in the 40 years since the original opened, the reward in 1999 should come to only $57,113.47, according to the Federal Reserve Bank in Minneapolis. But some things have not become devalued over the years: words like junk, for example. "Hill" was pronounced junk in these pages in 1959. And it is still junk (Lawrence Van Gelder).
 
* "THE INSIDER," starring Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer. Directed by Michael Mann (R, 155 minutes). Mr. Mann directs this taut thriller about the tobacco industry whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigand with pulse-quickening panache. And he illustrates why, in the corporate climate of the 90's, truth-telling is a riskier business than it was circa "All the President's Men." While Mr. Pacino delivers galvanizing moral outrage as a producer for "60 Minutes," and Mr. Plummer wickedly mimics Mike Wallace, Mr. Crowe movingly captures the complexity of Mr. Wigand's situation. Shaky docudrama ethics cloud the film's take on "60 Minutes." But this is an inordinately well-played thriller, with Mr. Mann's stylistic brio at its best (Maslin).
 
* "LIBERTY HEIGHTS," starring Adrien Brody, Bebe Neuwirth, Joe Mantegna and Ben Foster. Directed and written by Barry Levinson (R, 134 minutes). This semi-autobiographical comedy-drama remembering teenage life, anti-Semitism and racism in mid-1950's Baltimore is the fourth movie by Mr. Levinson to be set in his native city. A deeply felt nostalgia trip, the movie adroitly captures the look and social attitudes of the city 45 years ago. But the screenplay and performances are too muted for the movie to come to terms with growing pains cushioned in the nostalgic haze (Holden).
 
* "THE LIMEY," starring Terence Stamp and Peter Fonda. Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 89 minutes). From a director for whom the quirky stylistic exercise is standard style, this is a handsome throwback to the salad days of its two iconic stars. Mr. Stamp, in a stony, magnetic performance punctuated by flashbacks to his early career, plays an ex-con seeking revenge for the death of his daughter. He becomes the nemesis of Mr. Fonda's slick Hollywood hipster, in another role that's piquantly tailor-made. Mr. Soderbergh resurrects the lean, hard-boiled look of John Boorman's "Point Blank" as he dissects and considers these two tough customers from every conceivable perspective (Maslin).
 
* "MANSFIELD PARK," starring Frances O'Connor and Jonny Lee Miller. Written and directed by Patricia Rozema (PG-13, 105 minutes). In Ms. Rozema's skillful screen adaptation of Jane Austen's third novel, the protagonist Fanny Price (Ms. O'Connor) has been sharpened into a proto-feminist heroine who triumphs over the materialist, patriarchal values of her wealthy relatives through a combination of wit, beauty and daring. Without bearing down too heavily, the screenplay (which incorporates fragments of Austen's letters and diaries) equates early 19th-century slave-trading with the oppression of women. The message is leavened with smart humor and warm three-dimensional performances (Holden).
 
"THE MESSENGER: THE STORY OF JOAN OF ARC," starring Milla Jovovich, John Malkovich, Tcheky Karyo and Faye Dunaway. Directed by Luc Besson (R, 130 minutes). The Hundred Years' War feels twice that long in this shrill, frenetic account of Joan of Arc. It's a film whose main revelation is that the Middle Ages may have been a lot more lurid than previously reported. Mr. Besson directs plenty of grisly, hand-held battle scenes and absurd scenes of royal scheming, while Ms. Jovovich talks. Like this. And doesn't seem faintly plausible as France's teenage martyr. Here's a case where "Don't shoot 'The Messenger' " would have been sound advice (Maslin).
 
"MUSIC OF THE HEART," starring Meryl Streep, Aidan Quinn, Angela Bassett and Gloria Estefan. Directed by Wes Craven (PG, 110 minutes). Not many of us enjoy being lectured by dressed-down Hollywood stars in gritty classroom situations. But the true story of Roberta Guaspari, a music teacher in East Harlem and a single mother surviving a nasty divorce, has been given a blunt, no-nonsense tone that works. Ms. Streep gives a down-to-earth performance that is sheer award bait. The story is inspirational enough to take Ms. Guaspari from no job prospects to watching her proud students play alongside Itzhak Perlman, Isaac Stern and other violin stars. Not a bad reason for Mr. Craven to have sidelined the claws and hatchets for a while (Maslin).
 
"POKEMON: THE FIRST MOVIE," with the voices of Veronica Taylor, Philip Bartlett, Rachael Lillis, Eric Stuart, Addie Blaustein and Ikue Otani. Directed by Kunihiko Yuyama (G, 90 minutes). Parents don't have to know all 151 monsters to understand "Pokemon: The First Movie," but they can observe several in action, including Pikachu, cutest of them all. The magic doesn't bridge the generation gap; whatever makes "Pokemon" such a huge pop-culture phenomenon is still a secret of the grammar school set, but the film is energetic and the animation is fun to watch. The plot is about a bioengineered Pokemon who lures young Pokemon trainers (including 12-year-old Ash of the television series) into a showdown. Characters spout pacifist profundities while pairs of monsters punch each other silly (Anita Gates).
 
* "PRINCESS MONONOKE," with the voices of Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Billy Bob Thornton and Minnie Driver. Directed by Hayao Miyazaki (PG-13, 133 minutes). A landmark feat of Japanese animation from the acknowledged master of the genre. This complicated, exotically beautiful epic features gods and demons locked in battle for the future of the forest, and its visions are breathtakingly rendered. But it is the film's stirring use of nature, myth and Japanese history that makes it so special. Worth seeing just for its Forest Spirit, which takes animal form by day and roams the night as a diaphanous, Godzilla-like divinity. The image of plants and flowers springing to life beneath his hooves is ravishingly presented. Despite a superb blend of hand-drawn cels and fluid, computer-generated animation, the film's look is gratifyingly understated (Maslin).
 
* "RIDE WITH THE DEVIL," starring Skeet Ulrich, Tobey Maguire and Jewel. Directed by Ang Lee (R, 134 minutes). This contemplative Civil War epic, instead of concentrating on the major battles, looks at the outskirts of the conflict -- the Kansas-Missouri border -- where Confederate and Union guerrillas raid each other's outposts. The dramatic high point is a re-creation of Quantrill's Raid, in which a Confederate force swooped down on Lawrence, Kan., massacring 150 people. Mr. Maguire and Mr. Ulrich are childhood friends on the Confederate side, and the pop star Jewel (in her movie debut) is a young widow they both love. Even cooler in tone than "The Ice Storm," the movie is visually stunning and historically provocative but dramatically flat (Holden).
 
"ROSETTA," starring Emilie Dequenne. Directed by Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne (R, 90 minutes). This grim quasi-documentary, filmed with hand-held cameras (it's almost as jiggly as "The Blair Witch Project"), picked up the Palme d'Or (the top prize) at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year. Ms. Dequenne was also chosen best actress for her portrayal of a miserable 17-year-old Belgian girl living in a trailer camp with her alcoholic mother. Her desperate quest for a job and what she calls a "normal life" leads her to betray her only friend, who works in a waffle stand, by stealing his job. Unlike the Dardenne brothers' last film, "La Promesse," the movie's social realist angst feels contrived, and its main character never fully comes to life (Holden).
 
"SLEEPY HOLLOW," starring Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and Christopher Walken. Written by Andrew Kevin Walker and directed by Tim Burton (R, 110 minutes). This ornate visual fantasy, artfully concocted using a palette that suggests nuclear winter, has little to do with Washington Irving's story and everything to do with Mr. Burton's macabre vision. Mr. Depp makes a dashing hero as the film's shy detective, but the story (by the writer of "Seven" and "Fight Club") is determined to put the ick into Ichabod Crane. A first-rate cast and extraordinary technical talents are attention-getting here, but so is the film's penchant for sardonic beheadings. It's possible to admire Mr. Burton immensely, for the secret tenderness and rich imagination of his work, without wanting to peer at the exposed brain stems of his characters (Maslin).
 
* "THE STRAIGHT STORY," starring Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek. Directed by David Lynch (G, 110 minutes). As the least likely filmmaker on the planet to pull off a G-rated miracle, Mr. Lynch rises to the challenge with exhilarating vigor. It may not sound like much, but this account of an old man making a long trip on a riding lawn mower turns out to be a slow-moving, folksy-looking, deeply spiritual film with the power to hold audiences in thrall. And as Oscar may well note next spring, it would not have been possible without Mr. Farnsworth's terse, no-nonsense honesty at its heart. Mr. Lynch's famously unwholesome imagination crosses a new frontier to explore simple virtues and natural beauty. The result: a supremely improbable triumph (Maslin).
 
"THREE KINGS," starring George Clooney, Mark Wahlberg and Ice Cube. Written and directed by David O. Russell (R, 105 minutes). The prodigiously talented writer-director of "Spanking the Monkey" and "Flirting With Disaster" has made a much more ambitious film, with mixed results. His gimlet-eyed Persian Gulf war film has a "Catch-22" absurdist edge, but it also has an oversupply of visual affectations. Vertiginous music-video camera tricks jazz up the otherwise straightforward story of American soldiers who have larcenous designs on Saddam Hussein's captured gold and then develop conscience pangs about their own roles in Iraq. There are many clever peripheral touches, but there's something tamely conventional at the film's core (Maslin).
 
* "TUMBLEWEEDS," starring Janet McTeer and Kimberly J. Brown. Directed by Gavin O'Connor (PG-13, 100 minutes). An astoundingly vital performance by the British actress Janet McTeer makes this small, beautifully acted slice of contemporary Americana a must-see film. Ms. McTeer is Mary Jo Walker, a sexy, free-spirited woman with four marriages behind her who travels across the country with her 12-year-old daughter, Ava (Ms. Brown). Like few other films, this one captures an intimately loving (though not conflict-free) relationship between a parent and child without becoming saccharine. The director plays Mary Jo's trucker boyfriend, who is only the latest in a series of her romantic disasters (Holden).
 
"THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH," starring Pierce Brosnan, Sophie Marceau, Dame Judi Dench, Robert Carlyle and Denise Richards. Directed by Michael Apted (PG-13, 128 minutes). This director is much admired for his "Up" series chronicling the lives of former schoolchildren as they mature. And he has managed to make James Bond grow up a little, too. Mr. Brosnan has grown much more comfortable with the role of Bond, and most of the other characters are also more interesting than might have been expected. Ms. Marceau slinks memorably through the role of a treacherous oil heiress. Ms. Richards seemed a lot smarter playing high school vixens than she does as a brilliant scientist here. The itinerary roams from Scotland to Central Asia. And Mr. Apted handles the action as well as he does the talk (Maslin).

HEADLINE: CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK;
Stars in the Off Broadway Galaxy

BYLINE: By PETER MARKS 

 BODY:
ACTING awards may be self-indulgent and ever so tacky. But as long as we're stuck with them, why shouldn't there be a high-powered set of them for Off Broadway? Within the theater industry, the Obies, administered by The Village Voice, have considerable prestige, and the Drama Desks, parceled out to actors and productions on Broadway and off, certainly merit mention in Playbill bios.
Yet no one has devised the widely recognizable acting prizes that Off Broadway has so abundantly earned. I raise the issue (and not for the first time) not so much to encourage the further glitzing of New York's serious theater as to point out that when one has a hankering for great performances, more often than not the first places to look for satisfaction these days are the city's smaller stages. 
 Why this is so has a lot to do, of course, with the desperate recession of the straight play on Broadway: apart from John Pielmeier's failed thriller, "Voices in the Dark," and the comedy "Epic Proportions," no new Broadway play will have opened this season until David Hirson's "Wrong Mountain" bows in January. No such drought parches Off Broadway's landscape, however. There are, as always, a diverse and exceptional array of performers originating roles in new works and offering audiences that tantalizing drug of the theater: hope.
Earlier this year you could share the theatrical wealth with Viola Davis as the pitiable murderess in "Everybody's Ruby" at the Joseph Papp Public Theater; Lynne Thigpen setting off the bulk of the fireworks in "Jar the Floor" at Second Stage; Geoffrey Nauffts, Jodie Markell and David Alan Basche as unsettled yuppies in "Snakebit" for Naked Angels; and Darius de Haas as the young man lost to heroin and heartbreak in the Music-Theater Group's "Running Man."
They are only a sampling of who has come and gone of late (although there is talk of an impending transfer of "Jar the Floor" to Broadway). The pleasure of Off Broadway is that the door to discovery is a revolving one; the next terrific turn by an actor of note -- whether a familiar face or a complete unknown -- is only a matter of time.
As this is the season for giving, it's the ideal moment for a few reminders of the ways in which seamless, stylish performances are prizes unto themselves. Here, then, are a half-dozen examples of why casting directors for new Off Broadway plays may be the luckiest people in town.
STEPHEN SPINELLA. What a touching portrait of foolishness Mr. Spinella provides in "James Joyce's 'The Dead,' " the new musical based on the famous Joyce short story, now at Playwrights Horizons and moving to Broadway next month. On a stage overrun with fine singing actors -- among them Blair Brown, Marni Nixon, Sally Ann Howes and Emily Skinner -- Mr. Spinella sets his own ebullient pace as Freddy Malins, the happy drunk who so good-naturedly puts his foot in his mouth and leaves it there.
Not everyone is given such a beautifully drawn character in this musically rich if dramatically flawed evening; in thick mustache and natty bow tie, Mr. Spinella, who won back-to-back Tonys in 1993 and 1994 for his work in the two parts of "Angels in America," makes of Freddy a poignant party clown.
The actor, thankfully, avoids the pitfalls of ethnic stereotype. His bar song, "Three Jolly Pigeons," lifts the spirits as it celebrates spirits. Yet his Freddy is also a vaguely tragic character, drifting and remote, you intuit, whenever the music isn't playing.
 
Lisa Emery
In a crucial Act II encounter in "Dinner With Friends," Donald Margulies's splendid dissection of the anxiety that exists side by side with the comfort of long-term companionship, Ms. Emery's Karen sits down to lunch on a patio with her best friend, Beth, who is recently divorced and newly ecstatic over finding love again.
The scene progresses amiably until Beth, played wonderfully by Julie White, announces that she is going to marry again. The news upsets Karen in ways that seem unreasonable, and Beth lets her have it, accusing Karen of casting her as the perennial loser, of always needing her to remain a basket case.
Watching Ms. Emery process the information at the Variety Arts Theater is like peering into the back of a television set: you marvel at the sophisticated circuitry. Ms. Emery's Karen is a fuse that never burns completely down in "Dinner With Friends," and you are thankful for that. There is the sense in her performance of a fury that is better kept in check, and the thrill of her work here is that the danger of its exploding is ever present.
 
Mark McKinney
Daffy plays can go skin-crawlingly awry in the wrong hands. In the right ones, they're lighter than lemon meringue. And no one in the seriously loopy "Fuddy Meers" is righter or lighter than Mr. McKinney, who is emerging as one of the top-flight comic actors on the New York stage.
You may know his face from television, mostly squeezed into the wee hours: he performed for many years with the all-male Canadian comedy troupe "Kids in the Hall." His Spanish ambassador was the funniest player in the Roundabout's "Flea in Her Ear" a couple of years back, and his Millet, the dimwitted master of the sock puppet in David Lindsay-Abaire's hilarious new seven-character play on Stage II at the Manhattan Theater Club, is a goofball whom any fan of "The Three Stooges" can love.
In "Fuddy Meers," the puppet, Hinky Binky, which looks like a golf club cover with hands, is Millet's alter ego. Think of a Muppet with the mouth of Andrew Dice Clay, and you're in Hinky Binky's ballpark. Playing Millet and the puppet off each other, Mr. McKinney is a regular riot. One-man shows in New York have played to acclaim with a lot less going for them.
 
Linda Emond
Ms. Emond is one of those heroes of the theater who seem incapable of anything but excellence. In "An Experiment With an Air Pump" on the Manhattan Theater Club's main stage, she contributes yet another deeply intelligent and fully rounded performance to a growing list of personal successes, in shows like "The Dying Gaul," "Baby Anger" and "1776."
The cast of Shelagh Stephenson's "Experiment," which deals with the price of progress in two eras 200 years apart, is uniformly good. (Daniel Gerroll and Seana Kofoed are among the other standouts.) Ms. Emond, though, provides an extra level of satisfaction in the difficult task of doubling in the roles of two women -- one a frustrated wife in 1799, the other an ambitious geneticist in 1999 -- who offer a concise history lesson in the changing role of women across the ages.
Her introductory moments as the geneticist are some of her best. Called upon to reveal the character's passion for science, Ms. Emond takes us through a study of the 18th-century painting that gives the play its title. As related by the actress, it's a lovely, inviting prologue that offers immediate access to the interlocking themes of Ms. Stephenson's time-traveling play.
 
Sean Martin Hingston
Everyone makes a fuss about the Girl in the Yellow Dress. But what about the Guy in the Hairnet? Mr. Hingston is one of only two members of the 22-person ensemble who appear in all three of the dance plays that make up "Contact," the hit evening of dance-driven narrative at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater (and moving to the Beaumont in March).
Can you spot him in all three? In the first, "Swinging," a teasing curtain-raiser inspired by an 18th-century painting, "The Swing," Mr. Hingston is the hunky, poker-faced servant, pushing a sexually available young maid on a swing at her afternoon tryst with another man. In the third piece, "Contact," he plays one of the virile young swing dancers rejected again and again by the woman in yellow (Deborah Yates).
The inside joke is apparent in the second piece, "Did You Move?," in which Mr. Hingston is disguised as a cretinous restaurant employee, in glasses and hairnet, dragging Italian foodstuffs across the floor of the Queens restaurant in which Karen Ziemba dances her whimsical dream ballet. The gamut he runs in "Contact," from desirable to repulsive, is in both choreographic and dramatic terms, a leap of imagination.
 
Paula Pizzi
Ms. Pizzi has a slightly mysterious accent: it sounds vaguely Mediterranean. Her character's name, Susie Monahan, sheds no light on her origins. But there's nothing the least bit inauthentic about her performance as the empathetic nurse in "Wit," the Pulitzer Prize-winning and astonishingly long-running play at the Union Square Theater about a poetry professor's intellectual, emotional and terminal struggle with cancer.
If it is surprising that a play that deals so realistically with illness has developed a loyal following -- any drama that runs more than a year in New York has to qualify as a minor miracle -- the work of actors like Ms. Pizzi goes some way in explaining why. Her rendering of a nurse who ministers as much to the person as to the disease is the playwright Margaret Edson's sole acknowledgment here of the medical world's ability to feel as well as heal.
The director Derek Anson Jones could not have cast the role with a more profound sense of where the play's conscience lies. Ms. Pizzi's Susie is a lamb until her patient requires a tiger, and it is when this actress crosses over to fierceness in the climactic scene that "Wit" gives full vent to the outrages against the soul that some doctors may perpetrate in the name of fixing the body.

HEADLINE: A Missile Shield Could Backfire

BYLINE: By James Lindsay and Michael O'Hanlon; James Lindsay and Michael O'Hanlon are senior fellows at the Brookings Institution.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The presidential campaign may be heating up, but Republicans and Democrats are sounding remarkably alike on at least one important issue. Candidates on both sides want to build a national defense against missile attack.
The idea is sound, but a politically motivated rush to carry it out could do more harm than good. The technology for a missile shield isn't ready, and there's another, larger problem: Building it too fast risks damaging our relationship with Russia and could fuel nationalist fervor just as a Russian presidential election approaches. 
 A missile defense was once a Republican idea, and, predictably, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has pledged to begin deploying a system soon after taking office.
But the Clinton administration has also announced plans for a limited version capable of intercepting a few warheads and set to be ready in Alaska by 2005. Vice President Al Gore has not strayed from that position.
The administration hopes to reach a formal decision on its plan by the spring and to begin work before the Alaskan soil freezes in the fall, with official groundbreaking in the spring of 2001. Somewhere along that time line, the United States would violate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which prohibits a nationwide missile defense.
Despite its political appeal, a spring 2000 decision to build such a shield makes little sense technologically. Earlier this fall, the Pentagon successfully maneuvered a missile to strike and destroy a target warhead. But only 3 of a planned 19 tests are to be complete by next spring. Some technology for the system has yet to be developed, requiring tests to use jury-rigged rockets, and the program is short of parts. In 1998, a panel of defense experts headed by Larry D. Welch, a former Air Force chief of staff, described the compressed development schedule as a technological "rush to failure." It reiterated that conclusion several weeks ago.
The diplomatic dangers are even more compelling. Deciding to break the ABM Treaty would fan anti-Americanism in Russia just as the furor there over NATO's war against Serbia could be expected to be ebbing -- and just as Russian voters get ready to choose a new president next summer. That atmosphere could easily help elect a hard-line candidate, and the new government might retaliate by suspending work on bilateral programs intended to secure Russian nuclear materials and by refusing to take further steps to reduce the size of Russia's decrepit yet dangerous nuclear force.
The prospects for Russian economic reform might also suffer if the country's leaders decided to increase military spending. Finally, an embittered Russia might retaliate by selling nuclear and ballistic-missile technologies to rogue countries.
The United States does have good reasons to build a missile defense eventually. The ABM Treaty was intended to curb the superpower arms race of the cold war, and much of its basic logic no longer applies. The number of countries capable of attacking the United States with long-range missiles is growing; North Korea may soon be in this club.
Russia's concerns about missile defense, while partially understandable, are exaggerated. The small system that the administration is considering would not threaten Russia's nuclear deterrent. If Russia rejects reasonable efforts to reach an accommodation, the United States should eventually withdraw from the ABM Treaty.
But for now, we shouldn't have to choose between building a missile defense and maintaining good relations and cooperation on nuclear security with Russia. Before deploying any such system, we should work with the new Russian president to try to modify the treaty.
We may have to consider steps like reducing American nuclear forces, suspending the steps toward eastward NATO expansion and otherwise demonstrating to leaders in Moscow that the proposed system is a response not to their missiles, but to weapons from countries like Iraq and North Korea.
Rushing a decision on missile defense during a presidential year, when tempers are short in both countries and the necessary technology is not even ready, is nothing short of foolhardy.

BYLINE: Compiled by Joseph R. Gregory

ASIA
 
PAKISTAN: MORE CHARGED FOR CORRUPTION -- Shahbaz Sharif, left, has joined his older brother, the ousted prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, on the list of those accused by the new military government of treason and hijacking. "I am innocent, why am I in police custody?" the younger Mr. Sharif said in a court appearance. Two other Sharif family loyalists have also been accused in the case -- Saifur Rehman, the former chief of the government's anti-corruption unit, and Saeed Mehdi, who was Nawaz Sharif's principal secretary. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
INDIA: MORE MILITARY SPENDING SOUGHT -- The military budget should be increased from 2.3 percent of India's gross domestic product to 3 percent, the defense minister, George Fernandes, told a military conference in New Delhi, according to the Press Trust of India. The conflict with Pakistan in Kashmir this year demonstrated the need for more spending, he said. Barry Bearak (NYT) 

JAPAN: TAKING ON RECORD DEBT -- The cabinet said it would take on a record amount of debt to help finance a $172.5 billion supplementary budget. The package is aimed at increasing economic growth this fiscal year for the first time in three years, but it means Japan's debt this year will balloon to a record $367.6 billion, making it one of the most indebted nations. (AP)
 
CHINA: FALUN GONG CRACKDOWN -- China has sent 12 members of the banned Falun Gong spiritual movement to labor camps as part of a crackdown, a Hong Kong-based rights group said. The Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China said authorities in Heilongjiang Province sent four Falun Gong members to a camp for re-education. Another eight members, in Jilin Province, were given three years, it said. (Reuters)
 
UNITED NATIONS
 
UNESCO'S CHIEF PLEDGES REFORM -- Unesco's new director general, Koichiro Matsuura of Japan, warned that "unpopular measures" would be necessary to reinvigorate the troubled organization. Indirectly criticizing his Spanish predecessor, Federico Mayor Zaragoza, he acknowledged that accusations of "rampant nepotism" in Unesco were "not baseless." He said he hoped his reforms would woo back the United States, which left Unesco in 1984 charging corruption. Alan Riding (NYT)
 
EUROPE
 
YUGOSLAVIA: FUEL DELIVERIES DELAYED -- Serbian customs officials continued to hold up 14 tankers of heating oil donated by the European Union in a pilot project to help local governments of Nis and Pirot, two opposition-led towns in southern Serbia. Customs had taken samples from the tankers and were awaiting results, Serbian officials said. Carlotta Gall (NYT)
 
FRANCE: BOMBINGS IN CORSICA -- Two bombs exploded in Ajaccio, the capital, minutes after a warning from an anonymous caller. Thirteen people were slightly injured in the blasts at the Social Security offices and the headquarters of the Transport Department. Bomb attacks by separatists are not unusual in Corsica, but they usually happen overnight, sparing injuries. (AP)
 
UKRAINE: CHERNOBYL PLANT TO REOPEN -- Thirteen years after the world's worst nuclear accident, the Chernobyl power plant was scheduled to reopen today. Under a 1995 agreement with the Group of 7 leading industrialized nations, Chernobyl was supposed to be closed before the year 2000. But Ukraine says it has not received the money promised to complete two new nuclear reactors and will keep Chernobyl running until next year. (AP)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CHILE: PROTESTS FOR AND AGAINST PINOCHET -- Gen. Au-gusto Pinochet celebrated his 84th birthday, his second spent under arrest in Britain, with family, friends and a visiting delegation of high-ranking Chilean military men showing their support for his fight against extradition to Spain to stand trial on torture charges. In Chile, Reuters reported that his supporters staged a peaceful protest, left, in Santiago, the capital city, while two dozen anti-Pinochet students threw rocks at riot policemen who used water cannon and tear gas to disperse the protesters. No arrests were made. Warren Hoge (NYT)
 
MIDDLE EAST
 
IRAN: ASSASSINATION PLOT -- The Intelligence Ministry said it had detained 20 members of a hard-line religious group, Mahdaviyat, on suspicion of planning to assassinate President Mohammad Khatami, his predecessor Hashemi Rafsanjani and the former chief of the judiciary, Mohammad Yazdi. It was not clear what link might exist between the supposed plot and the country's wider political struggle between reformers and Iran's ruling Muslim clerics. John F. Burns (NYT)
 
ISRAEL: CONFLICT OVER A NEW ROAD --Israel will confiscate Arab land and destroy Arab homes built without permits so that it can build a road linking Jerusalem to the West Bank, Palestinian and Israeli officials said. The Palestinians accused Israel of trying to expand Jerusalem's municipal boundaries in an effort to cement its claim on the contested city. The road link will be made by building three tunnels through Arab East Jerusalem and the West Bank. (AP)
 
AFRICA
 
NIGERIA: TRIBAL VIOLENCE IN LAGOS -- President Olusegun Obasanjo issued shoot-on-sight orders after a riot between members of the Hausa and Yoruba ethnic groups in which at least 27 people were killed. The president said he had ordered the arrest, dead or alive, of members of a hard-line Yoruba group that he blamed for the battles in a market on the northern outskirts of the former capital.

Morgan Stanley Sets Price on Japanese Debt

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The Tokyo office of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter priced the first set of bonds linked to nonperforming Japanese real estate loans today, paving the way for what may be a flood of deals aimed at clearing away the mountain of bad debt on the balance sheets of Japanese banks and financial institutions.
"This is the first time a capital markets solution has been used to bring new investors and liquidity into the real estate market here," said Douglas Kennedy, executive director of the securitized products group at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo. 
 The deal was worth 21 billion yen, or about $200 million, making it larger than many in the market had thought. Mr. Kennedy said all but 4 billion yen of the bonds had AAA or AA credit ratings.
He said about 60 percent of the securities would be sold to Japanese investors, with the rest distributed about equally between Europe and the United States.
Foreign investment bankers have long advocated the development of a market in securities tied to Japan's large pool of nonperforming real estate debt. The precise figures are still unknown, but rough estimates suggest that Japanese financial institutions hold 80 trillion to 100 trillion yen, or $766 billion to $957 billion, in bad debt. As much as 50 percent of it is related to real estate, which lends itself to securitization, in which loans are packaged and sold as bonds to investors.
Mr. Kennedy said that if only 10 percent of those real estate loans were suitable for securitization, underwriters would have the opportunity for 250 deals.
But until a year or so ago, banks and other financial institutions had been slow to jettison their bad debts, afraid of damaging long-held relationships. Banks have tended to write off their bad loans by gathering reserves against them, which leaves the assets on their books.
That is changing, Mr. Kennedy said, noting that the mortgages that Morgan Stanley cobbled together to sell today had all been bought by Morgan Stanley between August 1998 and March 1999. "Financial institutions are really serious about cleaning up their balance sheets now, but it's only happened in the last two years," he said.
That, coupled with a renewed appetite for Japanese assets in general among global investors, and changes in laws governing real estate transactions, led to the opportunity that Morgan Stanley took today.

HEADLINE: Canadian Index at Record High On SurgingTechnology Shares

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Canada's benchmark stock index rose to a record yesterday, its first in more than a year and a half, powered by a monthlong surge in technology stocks.
The index, the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite, jumped 88.89 points, or 1.1 percent, to 7,853.39, surpassing the previous record of 7,822.55 set on April 22, 1998. Recessions in emerging markets, declining commodity prices and a falling Canadian dollar brought the index down from its previous high and dragged it as low as 5,336.16 on Oct. 5, 1998. 
 Trading was light yesterday with the United States markets closed in observance of Thanksgiving.
While Toronto-Dominion Bank and other financial-services stocks accounted for a portion of the gains, technology stocks like Nortel Networks, BCE and JDS Uniphase were the principal engine of the index's 10 percent rally through November.
Nortel, BCE and JDS account for more than 25 percent of the total market capitalization of the index, and their shares have been lifted by the soaring Nasdaq market in the United States. More than half of the Nortel and JDS shares traded in North America are traded in the United States.
In London, British stocks rose, pushing the FTSE 100 index to a record as three of Britain's biggest companies closed in on mergers.
The FTSE 100 rose 121 points, or 1.8 percent, to 6,682.80 and hit a record 6,686.10. About as many shares rose as fell, with buying focused on the biggest stocks.
German stocks rose, paced by Mannesmann amid optimism Vodafone may raise its hostile offer for the mobile phone company. Deutsche Telekom followed Mannesmann's lead. The DAX Xetra index of 30 major companies rose 142.72 points, or 2.45 percent, to 5,961.45.
In France, stocks rose, pushing the benchmark CAC 40 index up 163.22 points, or 3.15 percent, to a record 5,352.60.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei average of 225 Japanese stocks fell 174.43 points, or nine-tenths of a percent, to 18,721.78.

HEADLINE: The S.E.C. Tries to Make Companies TakeSmaller Baths

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
HERE was a time when the accounting police worried about companies that tried to avoid reporting losses. Now the cops are trying to keep companies from taking excessive write-downs.
That such vigilance is necessary is a commentary on the fads and fashions of Wall Street. Starting in the 1980's, companies discovered that they could look good if they reported certain kinds of losses that reflected efforts to become lean and mean. Analysts were persuaded to ignore such charges and concentrate on operating earnings. 
 Over time, the size and frequency of such write-offs grew. "Call this behavior Son of Gresham," wrote Warren E. Buffett in Berkshire Hathaway's latest annual report. "Bad accounting drives out good." He added that "the distortion du jour is the 'restructuring charge,' an accounting entry that can, of course, be legitimate but that all too often is a device for manipulating earnings."
The accounting rule makers tried in 1994 and 1995 to put limits on such write-offs, but their efforts met with success that can be generously described as limited. Last year, Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, complained that companies were taking "big baths" to get costs out of the way and make their subsequent profits look better than they were. Now the S.E.C. has produced a staff accounting bulletin that may reduce the abuses.
"There is a growing trend here which is disturbing," said Lynn E. Turner, the S.E.C.'s chief accountant, in an interview just after the bulletin was released on Thanksgiving Eve. He recalled how Americans used to mock the way European companies could create reserves to hide earnings swings and said that such things were now happening in this country.
Mr. Turner thinks the rules on such write-offs should be tightened and said he hoped the Financial Accounting Standards Board would do just that. But for now, the bulletin simply lays out the existing rules with details and examples that may make restructuring reserves smaller and less common. It should strenghten auditors' backbones when their clients try to take the biggest possible baths.
When taking a restructuring write-off, companies must specifically identify and disclose the costs involved and the anticipated effects on future profits. They must say which plants will be closed and which departments and locations will make layoffs. They need to be certain that the restructuring will happen. "When you set up one of these reserves, you have to be pretty sure that those are the costs you'll incur," Mr. Turner said. "When you get out there two or three years down the road, I don't see how you can do that." If cost estimates prove to be too high, companies may not use the reserve to hide other expenses.
I've talked to enough companies over the years to know that many companies have taken a more cavalier approach than the S.E.C. thinks correct, either in disclosing details of restructuring charges or in taking write-offs for things that may never happen. A couple of weeks ago, General Motors reported that it may have to reverse a good part of a $1.1 billion reserve because the strong economy means that it won't be cutting jobs as previously planned.
It will be interesting to see how many companies, confronted with the new bulletin, decide that they need to make adjustments to previous restructuring charges. What advice, I asked Mr. Turner, would he give to a chief financial officer in such a position?
"Take Maalox," he said, "before you eat turkey."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Low-Income Bronx Apartments Near Completion

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
Occupancy will begin in January at an apartment complex taking shape in the shadow of Yankee Stadium. The two buildings, with 252 apartments, represent one of the largest low-income rental housing projects erected in the South Bronx in recent years.
The $32 million project, to be completed in June, stands on a long-vacant two-acre site off East 165th Street between Gerard and River Avenues, four blocks north of the stadium. It will have two seven-story buildings facing Gerard Avenue, each with two three-story wings extending west to River Avenue and separated by landscaped courtyards, as well as a parking area for 50 cars. 
 The apartments, from studios to two bedrooms, with 450 to 750 square feet each, will be offered to families earning $14,000 to $34,620 a year, depending on family size, at rents of $350 to $637 a month. The developers have received more than 10,000 applications for the apartments, and are creating a list of eligible occupants. The buildings, called River Court and Gerard Court, are being developed by Related Companies, a large Manhattan developer, in partnership with the Leewood Real Estate Group of Staten Island.
The project is part of a new crop of more than 10,000 low- and moderate-income houses and rental apartments that have been built in the South Bronx since 1993. The activity has been spurred by city, state and federal financing programs.
One is the 100 Percent Low-Income Tax-Exempt Program, under which River Court and Gerard Court received financing. The program, started in 1997 by the city's Housing Development Corporation, combines low-interest loans financed by tax-exempt bonds with other public funding sources. The below-market loans allow developers to build apartments affordable to people earning no more than 60 percent of their area's median income.
Under the program, developers receive a loan from the housing corporation for at least half of a building's construction cost. In exchange, they agree to make all of the units affordable to low-income tenants.
The rest of the financing comes primarily from the sale of federal low-income housing tax credits to investors who use them to reduce federal taxes.
To repay the bonds, the developers can tap one of several other public- financing sources. One of them is the city's tax-abatement-certificates program, which links subsidies for market-rate housing in parts of Manhattan to production of low-income units elsewhere in the city.
Under that program, developers of the low-income housing get five certificates for every low-income apartment they build, which they can sell to developers of market-rate housing south of 96th Street in Manhattan. Each certificate entitles such developers to a property-tax exemption on an apartment; the exemptions are phased out over 10 years.
Russell A. Harding, the president of the housing corporation, said that pairing bond financing with federal tax credits as well as other funding sources in a single project, rather than allocating them separately, has proven effective in creating low-income housing at a time of limited public financing.
In the two years since the program began, the housing corporation has issued $118 million in tax-exempt bonds to finance 34 projects, most of which, Mr. Harding said, and developers agreed, would probably not have been built otherwise. The projects have or will produce over the next year 1,740 new and renovated rental apartments, mainly in northern Manhattan, eastern Brooklyn and the south-central Bronx.
In addition to River Court and Gerard Court, four other projects, with a total of 221 rentals, have been or will soon be completed in the Bronx. And two others, one with 79 units on East 148th Street and Brook Avenue, the other with 68 apartments at 1118 Intervale Avenue, will be developed over the next 12 months.
The River Court and Gerard Court project illustrates how the program works. The developers received $16.2 million in bond financing and secured a letter of credit from Hypo Bank to guard the bondholders from default. The sale of federal tax credits raised an additional $13.2 million, and the rest was the partners' own money, said R. Randy Lee, president of Leewood Real Estate.
The partners will sell 1,260 tax certificates generated by the project to repay the bonds and recoup their investment. The certificates will be sold to several Manhattan builders, and Related will also buy some for market-rate projects it is developing.
Mr. Lee said that without this program "a project of this scale could not have been built, because there are no other governmental programs that allow you to develop affordable rentals for working families."
This is the seventh low-income rental project the partners have developed in New York City in the last decade, and their first in the South Bronx. Its site, across River Avenue from the No. 4 train line, was once part of a larger empty parcel that another developer began to transform into low-income housing in the late 1980's. But that developer built only one 110-apartment building, on the corner of 166th Street and Gerard Avenue, before the city's housing market fizzled in the early 1990's.
The remaining two acres sat vacant until 1997, when Related and Leewood decided to build housing on it.
The two buildings were designed by Meltzer/Mandl Architects of Manhattan with varying heights of three and seven stories to provide more light and air into the apartments and avoid creating "a single giant box of a building," said Mr. Lee. The taller part of the structures also are on Gerard Avenue, farthest away from the noise of the No. 4 train line, which is elevated at that point, The entrance to the low-rise sections are off the interior courtyards, which will also have seating areas for tenants, Mr. Lee said. Occupancy will begin in January at River Court, and in June at Gerard Court.

HEADLINE: An Oasis of Peace in Somalia Seeks Freedom

BYLINE: By IAN FISHER 

DATELINE: BURAO, Somalia

 BODY:
It has been nearly nine years since the people of northwest Somalia gathered here to declare themselves separate from the chaos of the rest of their country. They created a government. They rebuilt their villages and businesses. A young veterinarian named Mohammed Nur Arale saw enough peace recently to invest in a luxury unknown in this town since 1988: a gas station with a pump that actually works.
"The mentality of the people is not the same," he said. "Now everyone has put down their arms. Everyone was just fed up with all of it." 
 The self-proclaimed Republic of Somaliland has become one of Africa's fledgling success stories -- but a success the outside world has been reluctant to help because no one is quite sure what to do with it.
Somaliland presents a quandary because it wants to be recognized as an independent nation. Its people argue that this would acknowledge their land as an island of peace separate from Somalia, a country so lawless that Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, recently referred to it as a "black hole."
African leaders hold few notions as sacred as the usually arbitrary borders drawn by and inherited from their European colonial rulers, because those frontiers define their power. They fear that if Somaliland splits off and becomes independent, what might happen to Nigeria, whose vast territory is riven by ethnic and religious differences? Or to Congo, Sudan and Angola, where competing factions and countries have exploited civil wars to carve fiefs that are essentially self-contained states? Is Africa to go the way of the old Yugoslavia, or Indonesia, where violence and strivings for independence have redrawn frontiers and led to new states?
And so, with another round of peace talks on the whole of Somalia scheduled to begin imminently, Somaliland is caught in what its foreign minister calls a "twilight zone," in which it exists in nearly every way as its own state, but survives on a mere trickle of foreign aid and cannot get access to international loans or banks.
The rest of the world, and the United States in particular, has done their best to forget Somalia since 1993. That year, 24 peacekeepers were killed in an ambush in June and, four months later, 18 American servicemen died in a battle in Mogadishu during the United Nations' effort to bring food and stability to a starving Somalia.
The United States, which had entered Somalia with great fanfare in 1992, proclaiming this the sort of intervention that would define the new world order that was supposed to follow the cold war, pulled out soon after those killings. So did the United Nations. Outside help dried up to nearly nothing. And Somalia became a symbol for anarchy, the disaster of misplaced foreign aid -- and how costly it can be for the West to intervene in conflicts it does not understand.
Now, a new consensus has begun to emerge among many outside nations and certainly among Somalis themselves: something needs to be done.
Certainly, that is the view of people in Somaliland, from businessmen like Mohammed Ahmed Barji, who trades in television sets, generators and mopeds and must load up suitcases with up to $50,000 in cash to go on buying trips abroad, to its president, Mohammed Ibrahim Egal, who says simply: "We want to be let in from the cold."
"After nine years we feel frozen," Mr. Egal, 69, a big man with a gray goatee, said in an interview. "Today it is a question of pride sustaining them," he said of the two million people of Somaliland. "But it may not be that way in five years. How much longer will they be able to be sustained by pride but on an empty stomach?"
For the outside world, there is another motive to attempt to restore something resembling order to Somalia, which has been without a central government since 1991, when the dictatorship of Siad Barre was overthrown after 22 years of misrule and an interminable civil war. The warlords and militias -- though substantially weakened -- continue to block peace.
In this power vacuum, diplomats and other experts say, Somalia is becoming a center for Islamic fundamentalism, for the smuggling of arms and drugs and the export of terrorism. Parts of the bombs that exploded in August 1998 at the United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania reportedly passed through Somalia, and supposedly the bombings' suspected mastermind, Osama bin Laden, did too, sometime later.
"We share the concerns that this place is in a state of chaos and is definitely a breeding ground for all kinds of trouble," said one American official.
That is exactly how the rest of Somalia is viewed by the people of Somaliland, who consider themselves different from the south.
Since colonial days -- when the Somali people were divided into five states -- Somaliland has had its own history. It was a British protectorate until 1960. It united with the Italian Somali colony four days after independence, creating modern Somalia. But Somaliland was never happy with the arrangement, wanting to revert to the borders of the British protectorate.
So in 1991, after Mr. Barre fell, a group of elders, intellectuals and other leaders came to this town to create the independent Somaliland republic. Progress was slow -- two civil wars were fought since then -- but over time the clan militias disarmed. The people created an unusual parliament mixing democracy with the traditional leadership of elders and clans.
And Somaliland has largely been blessed with peace.
"There was fighting five years ago and lots of banditry," said Muhammad Ahmed, 34, who calls out prayers in the biggest mosque in Hargeysa, about 100 miles west of here. "But it has completely changed. It's like the difference between the ground and the sky."
Ahmed Abdi Edan, 30, said he could never find work during the years of war. But in 1995 he got a job as an English teacher in Hargeysa.
"I really do think it is peace that let me find a job," he said. "Without peace you cannot live."
On a recent day, he was wandering around downtown Hargeysa -- still littered with what is left of the buildings bombed by the Barre government in 1988 -- to do a little investing: He was buying up American currency in the hope that it will rise against the Somaliland shilling.
That entrepreneurial spirit is perhaps the greatest strength of the Somalilanders, half of whom still live as nomads with their camels and goats.
In a few years, businessmen there have created one of cheapest telephone systems in Africa: international calls are $1.50 a minute in the day and only 80 cents at night. Traders are working to export frankincense and myrrh, and exploration has begun for oil and gemstones.
But the success of Somaliland rests on a shaky foundation. Its greatest accomplishment is undoubtedly peace, though the price is high: Over 70 percent of the budget (itself only $20 million) goes to maintaining a huge army and police force -- composed of former militia members who have agreed not to fight each other in return for their jobs.
That leaves nothing for education, health or roads. Many Somalis are thus becoming impatient with Mr. Egal and his government.
"Of course they can do more," said Hussein Egeh, a 59-year-old livestock trader who had fled Somalia 20 years ago but has returned to do business because of the peace in Somaliland. "What is a government for? When you have peace you don't just sit back."
Moreover, many in Somaliland distrust Mr. Egal, fearing that he may compromise on Somaliland's independence -- and may, as many foreign powers have urged him to do, find a way to reunite with the south.
"That will be the end of him, if he says we're going to the south," said Ismail Hirsi, a 30-year-old street businessman who changes as much $1,000 a day, money sent from Somalis living abroad. "He can't do that."
Mr. Egal argues that the answer to Somaliland's problems lies in recognition from other nations, which would open the floodgates for foreign aid and borrowing. As it stands, the United Nations and European Union are the biggest investors in Somaliland's recovery but the money is "peanuts," as one European aid worker put it.
On a recent trip abroad, Mr. Egal and his ministers argued their case with senior officials in Italy, Libya and the United States. They received lots of sympathy but little success. The international community, Somaliland leaders say, has promised a peace dividend for parts of Somalia that find stability. But without recognition, Somaliland has been unable to get money from institutions like the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund.
"They are very generous in dishing out promises," the foreign minister, Mahmoud Saleh Nour, said. "But very stingy in delivering."
Both Mr. Annan and American officials have discussed a kind of compromise -- a special status, similar to the West Bank or Kosovo, that would allow Somaliland to gain loans and more aid from outside nations without full recognition. But that seems unlikely while a new peace initiative, led by neighboring Djibouti, still holds promise.
This initiative is different because it looks for leadership in the south, not among the warlords but from elders, intellectuals, women's groups as well as businessmen and religious leaders.
Still, few experts hold much hope that even after nearly a decade of anarchy Somalia is ready to find peace -- or that Somaliland will go along.

HEADLINE: Strange Can't Begin to Describe It;
Fulani and Buchanan See an Upside to Political Marriage

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
One day soon, if all goes as planned, a woman who has campaigned time and again in Harlem for political office will do so again. But this time, Lenora Fulani, two-time presidential candidate, former standard-bearer of the now-defunct New Alliance Party, and perpetual thorn in the Democratic Party's side, will have company.
Ms. Fulani, long known as a far-left espouser of Marxist-Leninist politics, has promised to help Patrick J. Buchanan, a Reaganite and cold warrior known for his far-right politics, in his quest for the Reform Party nomination for president. In endorsing him earlier this month, she promised to take him to Harlem. 
 The reaction of Representative Charles Rangel, whose district includes Harlem, was typical. "Only in America," he said. "I just wish I had been the fly on the wall when they made that alliance."
Everyone agrees the alliance is unusual; some would call it unholy. Either way, Ms. Fulani, one of the more colorful, perennial figures in New York politics, has once again formed a relationship that allows her to keep a toehold in American politics.
By working within the Reform Party, where Ms. Fulani has a significant base of support and is its most prominent black member, she may be on the verge of gaining a national foothold for the first time -- much to the dismay of her critics, who are legion. Ms. Fulani and her close associate, Fred Newman, the founder of the New Alliance Party, have been accused repeatedly of anti-Semitism, entwining group therapy and politics in a cult-like way, and of enriching personal enterprises through public monies in the form of federal election funds.
Roger J. Stone, the director of the presidential exploratory committee of Donald J. Trump, a potential Reform Party rival of Mr. Buchanan, wasted no time calling Ms. Fulani a "con artist" and a "huckster."
Speaking of Mr. Trump's recent criticism of Fidel Castro, Mr. Stone said: "We find it ironic that on the same day Donald Trump was in Miami condemning a Marxist, Pat Buchanan was climbing into bed with one."
While Ms. Fulani and Mr. Buchanan have tried to stress their common economic populism, and particularly their antipathy for free trade, neither has made a real attempt to pretend they had, or would, reach agreement on the issues.
"He and I have never had an issue-oriented dialogue because there's nothing to talk about," Ms. Fulani said.
Mr. Newman, who has been Ms. Fulani's political Pygmalion, shaping her career, her image, her decisions, said: "He has positions that are antithetical to everything Fulani has said for years and everything I have stood for for years. Some of his rhetoric on immigration I find repulsive -- I can use no other word."
What brought Mr. Buchanan and Ms. Fulani together, they said at a news conference, was the banner that Ms. Fulani has carried since the early 1980's, and that Mr. Buchanan has suddenly hoisted: breaking the "iron grip" of the two-party system on American politics.
Ms. Fulani's driving issues are things like same-day voter registration, which she believes could give independent parties a fairer shot at the polls. She has arrived at a politics about process, bleached, for the time being, of issues and ideology.
"Issue politics were not given to us by Moses," she said.
Mr. Stone and other critics say that the real reason the two have pooled their efforts is to pursue the millions of dollars in federal matching funds that will go to the Reform Party nominee.
How much minority support Ms. Fulani can deliver is hard to gauge. Where she can help Mr. Buchanan is in complying with Reform Party rules that require him to gain enough signatures to qualify for the ballot in the 29 states -- and the District of Columbia -- where the party does not have an automatic slot.
It is a daunting task, requiring 700,000 to 800,000 signatures in total. Mr. Buchanan has said he does not have the personnel to do it. Ms. Fulani -- who collected 1.5 million signatures to get on the ballots in 1988 -- has both the foot soldiers and expertise (she has waged numerous court battles over ballot access).
In return, she gets, if not legitimacy, publicity. Eleven years ago, this self-described "poor black woman from Chester, Pa." waged a largely unheralded candidacy for president. She managed to get on the ballot in all 50 states, the first woman and the first black to do so, and received more than 200,000 votes.
The process was exhilarating to her; the lack of recognition -- by the media and political establishment -- embittering. So Ms. Fulani's endorsement of Mr. Buchanan seemed as much about drawing the spotlight to her as bolstering his campaign.
It worked. The endorsement quickly became grist for the talk show mill. It provoked agitated commentary everywhere from the Rush Limbaugh show to callers on WLIB. Ms. Fulani, on the margins for her entire political career, was suddenly in an eddy of the mainstream.
"She's now getting media attention she's never gotten and she can speak for these issues," Mr. Newman said, referring to her political reform agenda.
Mr. Newman and Ms. Fulani are also banking that Mr. Buchanan can earn enough votes to ensure that the Reform Party retains its federal matching funds.
The cost has been some blistering criticism. "I know politics makes strange bedfellows, but there has to be principles involved, and there are no principles here," said Michael A. Hardy, a former Fulani associate -- and admirer -- who serves as the lawyer for the Rev. Al Sharpton. "This is worse than Hitler-Stalin: this destroys a movement," he said, referring to a third party's potential to benefit African-Americans.
In the end, the endorsement is more likely to hurt Mr. Buchanan, who does have a core of committed supporters, than Ms. Fulani, who for all her talk about broadening American democracy, has often been most effective marshalling a committed cadre within a political party.
"Fulani and myself have such little credibility that there's not that much to lose," Mr. Newman said.
Pat Choate, the co-chairman of Mr. Buchanan's campaign, rejected the criticism that Mr. Buchanan had betrayed his base. "He's a candidate going out to win the presidency and he is building a coalition that can win it," he said.
For Ms. Fulani, however, there is, however, much to gain: along with a national stage, real power in New York politics -- and specifically, next year's Senate race. Over the past five years, Ms. Fulani and her supporters have gradually gained power in the state's Independence Party. The party now has the third line on the ballot; who it lends that line to in the Senate race could be crucial in a close election. (In New York State, the Independence Party is the Reform Party's outlet.)
Ms. Fulani is part of a "Democracy Coalition" that is trying to unseat the current chairman, Jack Essenberg, along with two-thirds of the party's executive committee, for "disloyalty and corruption."
"The Fulani group has basically infiltrated the party and wants to take it over and control it," Mr. Essenberg said.
Ms. Fulani responded by saying: "It's a democracy war. It's magnificent."
Laureen Oliver, the party co-founder and the leader of the Democracy Coalition, said that she has worked with Ms. Fulani because so far, she has done nothing to betray non-centrist leanings. "She has not made any extreme leftist statements since she's been in the party," Ms. Oliver said. "Lenora's what you call 'blending' now. She's blending into the party."
If she blends effectively enough, it could lead to this improbable scenario: Rudolph W. Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton both having to court Ms. Fulani's support to win the Independence Party's backing.
Mr. Newman said that Cathy Stewart, a close Fulani ally and the chairwoman of the Manhattan County Independence Party, had already had a brief discussion with Judith Hope, the chairwoman of the state Democratic Party. Ms. Hope would say only of the party generally, "Where we can find mutual goals and cooperation, it can be helpful."
Giuliani campaign officials would not comment on either Ms. Fulani or the Independence Party.
Of course, it is also possible that neither candidate will pass muster, and Ms. Fulani herself will run. She is coy about the prospect, but does not deny that it is a possibility.
She has already run for mayor, governor, lieutenant governor, and president, attracting columns of controversy along the way. She has embraced Muammar Qaddafi and Louis Farrakhan, and heckled Bill Clinton. She and Mr. Newman have made statements that have been denounced as anti-Semitic by Jewish groups like the Anti-Defamation League, even as they have repeatedly repudiated anti-Semitism.
The New Alliance Party, which was disbanded when Mr. Newman and Ms. Fulani joined forces first with the Patriot Party, then the Reform Party, was also criticized for its close links to Mr. Newman's extensive "social therapy" practice. The practice operated on the premise that political activism could help overcome emotional problems, and numerous therapy recipients also went into party work.
Mr. Newman also heads a complex constellation of businesses and nonprofit organizations, including a theater and publishing house, some of which benefited from the federal matching funds Ms. Fulani's 1992 presidential campaign earned. The funds went to different Newman and New Alliance Party enterprises for services like consulting and advertising, to buy -- at an elevated rate -- copies of the party newspaper, to rent office space from the party, and so on. The Federal Election Commission ordered the party to repay the government $117,000 for not doing arms-length transactions.
Ms. Fulani and Mr. Newman say (and Congressman Rangel, for one, agrees) that their practices were no different from the Democratic Party's, which they said also gives business and contracts to patrons and supporters. She has accused the Democratic Party of "postmodern political apartheid." Black leaders, she says, have sold out by insisting on support for a party that has repeatedly ignored black interests.
But even those who agree with that assessment wonder if Mr. Buchanan is the answer. Ms. Fulani's flirtation with him dates back at least to 1996, when she wrote that, like Ross Perot and Mr. Farrakhan, he had been demonized by the media: "He has tapped into the anti-government, anti-big-business, pro-people sentiments of a significant portion of the American people."
Now Ms. Fulani is forging ahead with her plan to bring Mr. Buchanan to Harlem, and specifically to the National Action Network, the headquarters of her erstwhile ally, the Rev. Al Sharpton.
The two worked closely together in the late 1980's and early 1990's, when "Rev.," as she calls him, was just venturing into electoral politics.
But Ms. Fulani says she felt betrayed when Mr. Sharpton ran for Senate as a Democrat in 1992, rather than under the New Alliance Party, after she had collected tens of thousands of signatures to help get him on the ballot. The break, she said, affected their friendship. Mr. Sharpton now plays down that friendship, saying they were never as close as the media projected.
He has yet to hear an explanation of the endorsement, he said. "Their concern is how do you build another party," he said of Ms. Fulani and her allies. "My view is, if the issues aren't more important than the party, then what are we in it for?"

HEADLINE: Radiation Ripples From Big Bang Illuminate Geometry of Universe

BYLINE: By JAMES GLANZ 

 BODY:
Like the great navigators who first sailed around the world, establishing its size and the curvature of its surface, astronomers have made new observations that show with startling directness the large-scale geometry of the universe and the total amount of matter and energy that it contains.
The results of those observations have provided powerful support for an audacious theory, first proposed 20 years ago, that may help answer the ultimate existential question: what ignited the Big Bang explosion in which scientists believe the universe was born? 
 The delicate measurements relied on telescopes placed high on mountains or borne by balloons to observe slight irregularities, or ripples, in a faint glow that permeates space and is thought to have been emitted from the fading fireball of the Big Bang explosion itself.
That glow is called the cosmic microwave background radiation, and the ripples imprinted on it can be used like ticks on a ruler to measure the cosmos.
The new data also provides fresh evidence to support a finding two years ago that the expansion of the universe is accelerating under the influence of a strange form of energy that fills empty space and apparently acts against gravity.
Many researchers had assumed that the bizarre finding would eventually be disproved, but the new observations support the existence of this energy, as well as the theory of what set off the Big Bang, called inflation, which was first proposed in 1980 by Dr. Alan Guth, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
"It has such tremendous implications for the universe," Dr. Rocky Kolb, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago, said of the new work. Dr. Kolb described the range of its implications as as staggering.
One set of results, released yesterday, was obtained by a team led by scientists at the California Institute of Technology and La Sapienza, the main campus of the University of Rome, using a balloon-borne telescope for observing microwaves. A report describing the results of this so-called Boomerang experiment was posted on a Web site maintained at the Los Alamos National Laboratory; it has not yet been subjected to peer review. The Web site is:
http://xxx.lanl.gov
 Last month, scientists at Princeton University and the University of Pennsylvania, who placed a telescope on a high plateau in Chile, published similar results in Astrophysical Journal Letters. Dr. Mark Devlin, from the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the team that worked in Chile, said, "These are completely different experiments with completely different calibrations and they fall right on top of each other."
A third team, centered at the University of California at Berkeley, has also released its preliminary map of the microwave background, made with another balloon-borne telescope.
The teams' conclusions rest on measurements of the precise size of the ripples in the microwave background radiation. That size turns out to be about one degree on the sky, or about twice the apparent size of the full Moon as seen from Earth.
The size of the ripples is a direct indicator of the large-scale geometry of the universe, which, according to Einstein's general theory of relativity, is in turn determined by the total amount of matter and energy that the universe contains. Ripples of one degree indicate a "flat" universe, in which parallel lines never cross. Inflation, the theory of what provided the fuel for the Big Bang, predicts a universe that is almost exactly flat.
"We're seeing that the universe is flat to amazing precision," said Dr. Craig Hogan, a cosmologist at the University of Washington. "It's what inflation predicted."
Dr. Scott Dodelson, a cosmologist at the University of Chicago, said, "Basically it gets a flat universe dead-on."
And that leads astronomers to their next conclusion: because the amount of matter found by astronomers cannot produce a flat universe, Dr. Dodelson said, "the inescapable conclusion is that there is some unknown form of energy contributing to the total density." (This unknown energy is distinct from so-called dark matter, once described as the missing mass of the universe.)
The most likely candidate for that exotic energy, Dr. Hogan and Dr. Dodelson said, is what has come to be known as the cosmological constant, an energy with repulsive gravity that may fill apparently empty space. Einstein first proposed the concept, thinking that he needed it to keep the universe from collapsing, but he later renounced the idea when it was discovered that the universe was expanding.
The geometry of the universe is determined solely by the amount of matter and energy contained in it, according to Einstein's general theory of relativity, which explains gravity as the "curvature" of space-time. In a geometrically "closed" universe, photons of light, initially traveling parallel to each other, would eventually converge, just as lines of longitude on Earth's curved surface meet at the poles.
Cosmologists agree that the universe could have three possible geometries. Besides the closed geometry, the universe might be open or flat. In an open geometry, parallel lines would diverge, and in a flat universe they would simply remain parallel.
Relativity predicts that a closed universe contains more matter and energy than a certain fixed amount. An open universe contains less, and a flat universe holds precisely that amount: the one predicted by Dr. Guth's theory.
According to the theory of inflation, a small piece of space became catastrophically stretched by the energy of fields that are predicted by advanced theories of physics. Those theories unify all known interactions between particles. No matter how curved that part of space might have been to begin with, this "inflation" would have stretched it out, like the surface of a balloon as it is blown up, in a tiny fraction of a second and created a flat universe. The tremendous well of energy in the inflated piece of space would have served as the fuel for the subsequent fireball of the Big Bang.
In the present universe, gravity does warp the relatively small regions of space close to massive objects like the Sun, neutron stars or black holes. Still, some cosmologists had suggested, on purely aesthetic grounds, that the universe in the large would be free of curvature. Inflation, with its cosmic stretching, was the first theory to explain why those suspicions might be true.
But despite that stretching, inflation would also leave telltale ripples on this exploding, Big Bang universe. The ripples occur because of principles of quantum mechanics, which impose a kind of small-scale fuzziness on all particles. The ripples in the microwave background are thought to be the legacy of that early quantum fuzziness.
The background radiation, cosmologists believe, was emitted from the fireball of the Big Bang after the inflationary expansion a few hundred thousand years after the creation event. The radiation then traveled through space for roughly 15 billion years, the present estimated age of the universe, and arrives at Earth as a sort of cosmic fossil.
"The ripples themselves were produced during inflation," Dr. Kolb said.
Because cosmologists can calculate the actual size of the ripples in the young universe, their apparent size on the sky is a measure of whether radiation from them traveled to Earth on straight or curved paths. The paths turned out to be straight, providing the main piece of evidence for the flat universe.
The Boomerang experiment measured the ripples using a telescope based on reflecting, aluminum optics and a cooled, semiconducting detector that looks like a tiny spider web, said Dr. Paolo de Bernardis, an astrophysicist at La Sapienza, who is a principal investigator of the Boomerang experiment. The microwaves heat the detector very slightly, and that change is converted into an electronic signal.
"The system is so cool and so clean that you can detect these changes in the system," he said.
The Maxima experiment, based at Berkeley, used a related balloon-borne system. The Microwave Anistropy Telescope, which made its own measurements from a high plateau in Chile, used an entirely different detector based on powerful electronic amplifiers.
All the data are consistent with a flat universe, said scientists on the projects and others who have read the teams' reports.
"These really favor a flat universe," said Dr. Alessandro Melchiorri, an astrophysicist at La Sapienza.
Dr. Kolb of the University of Chicago said that the new results easily represented the biggest step in the field since NASA's Cosmic Microwave Background Explorer first saw the barest outlines of the ripples in 1992. Even that satellite could not detect the much tinier ripples that have been measured by the new telescopes. Dr. Kolb described the reaction of inflationary cosmologists to the new data as one of "guarded euphoria."
Scientists on all the experiments said that even more precise data would soon be made public, offering the promise of even tighter tests of inflation, and of the geometry and contents of the universe.
"You haven't seen anything yet," said Dr. Adrian T. Lee, a Maxima collaborator at Berkeley. "We are entering the era of precision cosmology."

HEADLINE: Civilian Police Force Brings New Problems in Haiti

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti

 BODY:
Renan Etienne keeps his military academy diploma hanging in his office, although it is an odd decorative touch. He is the Port-au-Prince commander for the Haitian National Police, the civilian force that replaced the brutal and corrupt Haitian Army.
After Mr. Etienne spent eight years as a military officer, his career there ended in 1994 when the reformist President Jean-Bertrand Aristide disbanded the army. 
 The Haitian military had worked hand in hand with the country's dictators, terrorizing civilians in the decades that preceded Mr. Aristide's election in 1990. Then the military deposed him and forced him into exile, but after he returned with American backing, he replaced the military with a civilian police force.
Mr. Etienne, like only a handful of other former officers, had both the experience and clean record to qualify as a commander for the mostly rookie police force.
"It's the same job," he said tersely on a recent day.
But his two careers are hardly comparable. Unlike the army, the civilian force, which was trained by police officers from a United Nations-led mission, is seen as relatively respectful of human rights. But also unlike the army, which had ample weapons and resources, the fledgling force finds itself at times scrambling to meet its basic needs. That has led, he said, to a morale crisis.
"We do not have enough human and material resources," Mr. Etienne said. "It seems if you have radios, they have no batteries. If you have cars, they have no tires. If you have guns, they have no bullets."
Nearly four years since it was founded, and just months away from the end of the full-time American military presence in the capital, the Haitian National Police is struggling to maintain order while people complain increasingly about crime and a lack of security.
Of the original 5,300 members, 1,000 have been dismissed for corruption or human rights abuses, and the force is trying to recruit replacements. A lack of seasoned commanders means that some towns have no police supervisors. Specialized units critical to investigative work are just now being formed.
These internal challenges are made more difficult by external pressures. Haiti's judicial system badly needs reform. Caseloads are backlogged for years. Judges are poorly trained, and many are believed to be corrupt. Criminals with enough influence are freed soon after their arrests. Human rights monitors suspect that several police officers, frustrated by the failings of the courts, have taken part in vigilante killings.
"It would be hard enough under normal conditions," said Pierre Denize, the chief of the Haitian National Police. "The conditions here have been less than normal. If I, as the head of this institution, said we do not need anything more, I would be very wrong. Institutional development is a notion that entails 15-year spans of time. Here, we're talking about four years."
The most troubling challenges yet emerged in February, when popular organizations aligned with Mr. Aristide's Fanmi Lavalas political party, citing the crime problem, clamored for the resignation of Robert Manuel, the vice minister for state security. Mr. Manuel, whose jurisdiction included the police force, was part of the administration of Rene Preval, Mr. Aristide's hand-picked successor. But with Mr. Aristide apparently planning to run again next year, the two became rivals.
Mr. Manuel finally resigned under pressure in October, and soon afterward, Jean Lamy, considered to be a candidate to replace him, was assassinated. No arrest has been made. When Mr. Denize went to Mr. Lamy's funeral, demonstrators loyal to Mr. Aristide disrupted the service and heckled him.
The events are an echo of old-style Haitian politics, with the police leaders coming under relentless criticism by political groups seeking to put their allies in key positions to gain an advantage in legislative elections scheduled for March. The fear is that the police will be used to intimidate voters or to protect fraud.
"There has always been the courting of the force by different political parties," Mr. Denize said.
Colin Granderson, the executive director of the United Nations/ Organization of American States International Civilian Mission in Haiti, said the pressures on the police are of special concern at a time when the government is already functioning without a Parliament or constitutionally appointed prime minister. The government has been virtually paralyzed for two years over the refusal of an opposition legislation to approve a prime minister and then the end of the legislative terms and a postponement of new elections.
"There is a lot of concern about what is happening with the police and if they are going to be destabilized or fall into the clutches of Aristide," Mr. Granderson said. "You are dealing with a police force started from scratch and thrown into a cauldron. It is not a propitious environment."
The force's top commanders, as well as other government officials, insist they will not allow the police to become politicized. The officials are supported by international officials and diplomats, who have conveyed a similar message to Mr. Aristide.
Yvon Neptune, a spokesman for Fanmi Lavalas, suggested that some of the recent disturbances, protesting a lack of security for citizens, were the work of provocateurs opposed to Mr. Aristide. He added that his party was not in a position to choose police commanders, but that its criticism of the police force's performance was legitimate.
"We have not contented ourselves to say the police force is young and doesn't have enough material," he said. "We also have to question those who are in charge, not only how they perform, but what are their policies."
Along the streets of the capital, police officers are rarely seen, except for a handful in crisp blue-and-tan uniforms directing traffic. There have been some brazen assaults, like the recent robbery of a food wholesaler in which 10 armed men exchanged gunfire with the police. Two robbers were killed, but the rest escaped.
Some downtown merchants are so fearful of crime that they allow only one customer at a time into their stores, while many residents stay inside in early morning and evening hours to avoid bandits.
"This is a Dracula country," said Fredy Antoine, a mattress salesman at the teeming Solomon Market. "If you have a couple of dollars in your pocket, anyone can come and tell you to give it to them."
The man appointed prime minister after the legislature went out of office, Jacques Alexis, said the original design of the police force was part of the problem. "When we asked for high school diplomas for the new recruits, we ended up with people who saw the police as a transitory position and who were waiting for the next opportunity to move on when something better showed up," he said.
"There was the temptation of drug trafficking and other cases of corruption," he said. "That is why the next group of recruits will be selected from candidates without high school diplomas who see the police as a job where they feel valued and as a way to move up."
Mr. Alexis also said that Haiti needs the files on political crimes and human rights abuses committed by supporters of the coup against Mr. Aristide because they might still be involved in criminal activity. The documents were seized by American troops and have not been released because they contain the names of American agents and information on intelligence methods.
"Maybe we could not prosecute all the cases," Mr. Alexis said. "But the fact that the people who are still out on the street know we have the files -- then perhaps that would be a means of controlling them and calming them down."
While conceding that crime has increased, Mr. Denize said that it is not as bad as in some other countries. He said the level of violence is "inexplicably low" considering that most people in the capital live crowded in impoverished shantytowns. He said some of the growing outcry about security comes from upper-class residents who have lived comfortably in the hills overlooking Port-au-Prince.
These people, he said, traditionally were "very well protected by the army that served them and the repressive, dysfunctional system that went with it."
"When this bulletproofing was no longer there, they fell prey to criminality like everyone else," he added.
The concerns over security, he said, must be seen as part of a complex of problems facing the nation: an economic crisis, criminals deported to Haiti from the United States and Canada, and drug traffickers who can buy favors and silence.
"We have real social factors that put criminality on the rise," he said. "And it is a very democratic criminality.

HEADLINE: Former Drug Chief Says U.S. Brushed Aside Mexico's Role

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: ALBANY

 BODY:
During the five years that Thomas A. Constantine spent as the nation's top drug-enforcement official, he never sat down with President Clinton to discuss drug policy. He was never called to brief the president on a major enforcement issue. The phone never rang for a chat.
Mr. Constantine, who came to the job after more than three decades in the New York State Police, initially took some pride in being a Washington outsider. But by his retirement last summer, he acknowledges, he had become a different kind of outsider -- one circumvented by the White House, particularly in its annual evaluation of anti-drug efforts in Mexico. 
 "The policy makers from the National Security Council and the State Department started with the premise that they were going to certify Mexico," Mr. Constantine said recently of what he described as the administration's unspoken determination to put economic concerns ahead of drug issues. "Their question was, 'How do we get around the facts presented by Tom Constantine?' "
Depending on one's perspective, Mr. Constantine emerged at the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as either a truth-teller among cynical bureaucrats or a resonance box for the sometimes conspiratorial views of his agents.
Mr. Constantine uses the word whistle-blower with a beat cop's derision; when the subject of his bureaucratic battles arises, he says he has no interest in attacking the president or his policies, even those with which he disagreed. Still, it is hard to leave a few long conversations with Mr. Constantine, 61, without the impression of a man struggling to hold his tongue out of loyalty to a system he sees as flawed and a president he does not seem to respect.
"I watched that situation for five and a half years, and every year it became worse," he finally said of the drug trade in Mexico. "We were not adequately protecting the citizens of the United States from these organized-crime figures."
A White House spokesman, Mike Hammer, said the administration would have no comment on Mr. Constantine's remarks.
At a time when the nation's drug policies are coming under their sharpest public attack in decades, Mr. Constantine came through his tenure as the drug-enforcement agency's administrator relatively unscathed.
Challenges to the Clinton administration's limited efforts to reduce the demand for illegal drugs have been directed mainly at the White House and its drug-policy adviser, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey. Criticism of its policies on drug laws and other enforcement issues has mostly fallen on General McCaffrey and Attorney General Janet Reno.
But while budgets rose steadily at the Drug Enforcement Administration under Mr. Constantine, allowing for the hiring of hundreds of new agents, there has been relatively little evidence that the agency is making any real headway against the world's most powerful traffickers.
The Drug Enforcement Administration played a central role in the arrests of Colombian cocaine bosses in 1995 and 1996, only to see smaller, more elusive groups quickly take their place. After having some success in Bolivia and Peru, the agency has watched much of the drug business there shift to Colombia. And while the agency has struck at some important traffickers in Asia, it has been mostly helpless as drug production has reportedly risen sharply in Burma and Afghanistan.
Nor is it clear that Mr. Constantine's efforts to strengthen the drug agency's ties to local and state police forces contributed significantly to the declines in drug violence. The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, said in July that it was hard to assess the agency's work at all because of its failure to set measurable standards of performance.
A notoriously demanding boss, Mr. Constantine was said by some of his critics within the agency to have driven away some of its most experienced officials, a charge he denies.
Still, Mr. Constantine said his greatest frustration came from Mexico. Evidence of the growing power of Mexican drug mafias greeted him almost as soon as he took over the agency in March 1994. Mexican traffickers were by then taking as much as half of the Colombian cocaine they moved into the United States as payment for their services. Mexicans were also dominating the growing American market for methamphetamine and expanding their distribution of heroin across the western United States. "In retrospect, we underestimated their importance," Mr. Constantine said of the Mexican traffickers. "The focus at the time was all on Colombia."
Mr. Constantine said he quickly detected another pattern as well.
"Every time we had a major case involving a criminal organization from Mexico operating in the United States, there was a significant allegation of corruption involving the Mexican Attorney General's office, a Mexican state police force, the highway police," he said.
But, Mr. Constantine said, other Clinton administration officials were resolute: American concerns about Mexico's corruption and drug-trafficking problems were secondary to trade and other economic interests.
"The idea was, if you said those things publicly, if you release documents, you will just aggravate the situation," he said. "My concern was that we had kids in this country dropping like flies. Maybe that was parochial, but I felt like I was the only person there who felt like that."
Even after Mr. Constantine's counterpart in Mexico was found in 1997 to have been colluding with the country's biggest cocaine trafficker, serious discussion of the issue within the Clinton administration was minimal, even negligible, he said. The exception was the annual debate over whether to certify the anti-drug efforts of Mexico and other nations that produce or ship illegal drugs.
"Everyone would say, 'Your facts are correct, but there are bigger policy issues involved,' " Mr. Constantine recalled.
Mr. Constantine, who now teaches at State University of New York at Albany and consults on law enforcement, said it had never occurred to him to resign in protest. "My sense was that you always ought to try to make it work," he said.

HEADLINE: Croatia Moves to Declare President Temporarily Incapacitated

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Nov. 25

 BODY:
The Croatian government, meeting today in emergency session, asked the Constitutional Court to declare the ailing President, Franjo Tudjman, temporarily incapable of carrying out his duties.
The court is expected to agree within 24 hours, the period stipulated in a constitutional amendment passed on Wednesday. Mr. Tudjman, who has run Croatia like an autocrat since it became independent of Yugoslavia in 1991, has been incommunicado in a hospital since Nov. 1. He is 77 and is reported to be close to death from stomach cancer. 
 Once the court agrees, the speaker of Parliament, a member of Mr. Tudjman's governing Croatian Democratic Union, will take over key presidential powers. The speaker, Vlatko Pavletic, is expected to authorize parliamentary elections on Dec. 28 or 29, timing seen as favoring the governing party, which fears losing power to a center-left opposition coalition now ahead in the polls.
There must be at least 30 days for campaigning after the announcement of an election. Mr. Tudjman, before falling so ill, had favored an election date of Dec. 22, but did not formally declare it. Parliament's term expires on Saturday, and new elections must be held by Jan. 27.
Ivo Pukanic, the editor of the independent weekly Nacional, said in an interview today that an election in the holiday period favored the conservative, more rural-based Tudjman party, because Croatian workers abroad will be home to vote, urban workers will be in their native villages and richer, more liberal Croats "will be abroad skiing, in Austria, Italy or Slovenia."
Abstentions are also likely to be higher during the holiday, also favoring the more tightly organized governing party. Still, Mr. Pukanic believes that with the party unpopular because of corruption and a weak economy, the opposition will win a majority in Parliament. But he said the party was likely to win a separate election for president to succeed Mr. Tudjman, if it can agree on the centrist foreign minister, Mate Granic, a favorite of Washington, as its candidate.
In a daily medical bulletin today, doctors said Mr. Tudjman's condition remained grave but "is stabilizing thanks to intensive treatment." There were no other details.
But the leadership of his party asked the government to meet to declare the temporary incapacity of Mr. Tudjman.
"After receiving the opinion of the medical team, the government has decided to ask the Constitutional Court to determine temporary incapacitation of President Tudjman," Prime Minister Zlatko Matesa told reporters after the cabinet met.
The death of Mr. Tudjman, who has had a sometimes confrontational relationship with Washington and the European Union over questions of war crimes, autocracy, media control and political repression, is expected to ease Croatia's entry into the West. An opposition victory in elections deemed free and fair would have a significant impact, not just on Croatia's relations with the West, but also on the rest of the Balkans, including Serbia, where a democratic opposition is trying to oust President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
Mr. Pavletic, whose own mandate was extended by Parliament on Wednesday, can hold temporary presidential powers for 60 days, but they are renewable.

HEADLINE: After Open Enrollment: CUNY's New World

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The controversy on admissions of students who need remediation to the senior colleges of the City University of New York (front page, Nov. 23) misses a vital point: what goes on inside the colleges. 
 Huge grade curves are the order of the day, to push failing students into a passing grade. This is the university equivalent of "social promotion" in the high schools.
Our department conducted an assessment of the large lecture courses in basic economics last spring. The average grade curve was 15 points, making the passing grade 45 percent. In a four-choice multiple-choice exam, the average knowledge required to achieve this score is 26 percent (with the rest achieved by guessing).

HEADLINE: Federal Budgets, Both Ways

 BODY:
With tempers still sore from their recent federal budget battles, Congress and the White House are quietly preparing for the next fight. Both Republicans and Democrats are offering a split personality to voters, proclaiming a love for fiscal discipline and also for calculated spending increases in defense, education, health programs and financing for research. The latest economic projections suggest that both parties will be able to continue avoiding hard choices. If the year finishes up in robust economic health, federal revenues ought to be plentiful enough for Congress and the White House to save some money and pay for targeted programs at the same time. The election may also prove that voters like having it both ways.
With the last completed budget of the Clinton era now in place, it is possible to take stock of just what President Clinton has accomplished in budgetary terms. Since 1992, he has brought the discretionary domestic spending portion of the budget down from about 3.5 percent of the domestic economy to roughly 3.2 percent, about the level that it was in 1969, according to Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution. That figure will no doubt disappoint the liberals and progressives who had hoped that the first Democrat elected since the 1970's would reorder the nation's political priorities. 
 On the other hand, since Mr. Clinton has presided over what could turn out to be the longest economic boom in American history, there has been room to increase domestic spending in real terms even though it is now less of a percentage of the economy than before. Mr. Reischauer calculates that domestic discretionary spending -- the core of what the battles with Congress have been about -- has gone up 13.5 percent since Mr. Clinton took office, after inflation. That is less than 2 percent a year, a modest increase but one that has had a significant impact in certain areas.
The administration can rightly claim to have achieved some targeted increases that go beyond these modest numbers, most notably in education. Head Start is now financed at nearly twice the level it was in 1993. The administration was able to win much more support for after-school programs, job training and acquisition of green spaces than many would have thought possible after the Republicans took over Congress in 1995. On top of these efforts has been the expansion of three major entitlement programs -- the tax credit for the working poor, a health insurance program for children in working-poor families and expanded health care for disabled workers. These are all steps that, while incremental in nature, have advanced the social welfare agenda under Mr. Clinton.
Whoever wins the next election, it seems safe to say that the paradigm defined by Mr. Clinton in the 1990's may well prove irresistible to his successor. The attraction of fiscal discipline and balanced budgets has been used successfully by the Democrats to blunt Republican efforts to enact big tax cuts. But the same tactic has meant that the Democrats themselves cannot advocate big new spending initiatives without opening themselves up to the same charge of fiscal recklessness. Stringent budgets that allow increased spending on the margins may be the hallmark of this era of prosperity.
For all their sparring over fiscal issues, the major presidential candidates in both parties have said little to indicate that they would change this cautious approach to federal budgets. Indeed, it is hard to imagine the model being reversed until and unless there is an economic collapse. Having it both ways is what politicians and many voters like best.

HEADLINE: Long Road in Nigeria

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Your Nov. 26 editorial "Nigeria's Clean Broom" realistically highlighted the political and socioeconomic challenges for Nigeria. The outside world and news media would do well not to expect too much too soon. 
 In a nearly bankrupt country of more than 100 million people speaking 300 different languages and ruled and terrorized by the army for 29 of its 39 years of independence, torn by tribalism and sectarian violence, President Olusegun Obasanjo's democratic government faces monumental obstacles.
But beyond complying with international human rights standards, as you suggest, Nigeria should privatize its ailing industries and reprivatize those that it nationalized during the 1970's, driving away foreign investors. When I left Nigeria in the early 1980's for the United States, the naira was almost equal to the United States dollar in value. Today, one dollar can fetch 100 naira, depending on the medium of exchange. This is a measure of how low the Nigerian economy has sunk under corrupt regimes, civilian and military.

Nasdaq Reaches Another Record During Light Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq stock market sprinted to another record yesterday, as investors gave Internet retailers a boost at the traditional start of the holiday shopping season. But stocks over all had a mixed performance in light post-Thanksgiving trading.
And in the bond market, prices fell for a fourth consecutive session, dragged down by weak overseas bond markets and strong economic numbers that have prompted fears of rising inflation. The price of the 30-year Treasury bond dipped 13/32 , to 9818/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.23 percent from 6.20 percent on Wednesday. 
 The Nasdaq composite index rose 27.31 points, to 3,447.81, for its 16th record in the last four weeks. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 0.46 points, to 1,416.62, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 19.26 points, to 10,988.91.
For the week, the Nasdaq composite index added 78.56 points, and is now up 57.24 percent so far this year. The Dow Jones industrials dropped 14.98 for the week, while the S.& P. 500 slipped 5.38.
"A tremendous pocket of strength in technology is pulling up the Nasdaq," said Richard McCabe, chief market analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company.
But he cautioned that over all, the declining stocks are outpacing those advancing, which should raise a cautionary note for investors.
Stock gains were held back by inflationary concerns related to a Commerce Department report yesterday that Americans' personal income in October posted its biggest jump in more than five years, and rose more than twice as fast as spending. Personal income, which includes wages, interest and government benefits, surged by 1.3 percent in October.
It was another sign of the nation's economic strength, which added to bond-market jitters that the Federal Reserve might raise interest rates again early next year to hold down inflationary pressures.
Trading was listless as the stock market closed at 1 p.m. yesterday, three hours earlier than usual, as traders were on a holiday weekend schedule.
Benefiting from the traditional kickoff of the holiday shopping season on the day after Thanksgiving, the online retailer eToys rose 3 3/8, to 67 13/16, along with Amazon.com, up 7 1/16, to 94 1/4. Toys "R" Us gained 1 1/4, to 18 3/8. Wall Street has high hopes for brisk online selling in the next month.
Leading the Dow was AT&T, up 4 1/4, to 57 7/16. The company, the largest United States long-distance phone concern, is reportedly considering selling stock in its wireless unit.
Technology concerns benefited from institutional investors buying the year's hottest equities so that those issues are included in their year-end portfolios, Mr. McCabe said. "Strength is begetting strength and for no particular fundamental reason," he said.

HEADLINE: Study Details Sacrifices In Caring for Elderly Kin

BYLINE: By SARA RIMER 

 BODY:
A small study that surveyed the economic cost to individuals who provide informal care for elderly relatives has found that working caregivers sacrifice substantial wages and benefits by passing up promotions, training and transfers, and taking extended time off from their jobs to fulfill their family responsibilities.
Of the 55 individuals surveyed, nearly two-thirds reported that taking care of an elderly relative or friend had cut into their earnings, and the cost to 30 of those who were able to provide enough information to quantify the financial effect was estimated at an average of $659,139 in lost wages, Social Security and pension benefits over their lifetimes. 
 The study, conducted for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company by the National Alliance for Caregivers and the National Center for Women and Aging at Brandeis University, was intended as a follow-up to a larger study in 1997 by the alliance and AARP.
The 1997 study, which surveyed 1,509 people, found that 1 in 4 families had at least one adult who had provided care for an elderly relative or friend in the past 12 months in which they were interviewed. The 55 people who were surveyed recently were selected from the 1997 study.
In honoring their obligations to elderly relatives, those who provide care may endanger their own long-term financial health, said Phyllis Mutschler, executive director of the National Center for Women and Aging at Brandeis.
Concerns about the costs of long-term care are rising along with the skyrocketing numbers of elderly Americans; the National Alliance for Caregivers estimates that the number of employed people who provide such family care will grow to 11 million to 15.6 million over the next 10 years.
"Elder care is to the 21st century what child care has been for the last few decades," said Joyce Ruddock, a gerontologist who heads the Long-Term Care Group at Metropolitan Life.
The caregivers surveyed were 45 years of age or older in 1996, and they provided, on average, about eight years of care.
Of those interviewed, 29 percent said they passed up a job promotion or training, 25 percent passed up a job transfer and 22 percent were not able to acquire new job skills.
Among those providing financial information, the average total loss in wage wealth, which the survey defined as the current value of lifetime wages calculated as of the date of the retirement, was $566,443. In addition to current income, they also lost retirement savings.
As a result of their taking care of the elderly, those surveyed estimated that their Social Security benefits decreased an average of $2,160 annually. Over their retirement years, their lost Social Security wealth averages $25,494.
Among those surveyed who are eligible for pensions and able to provide information about them, their estimated average pension benefits fell by $5,339 annually as a result of their elder care, or $67,202 in pension wealth, on average, over their retirement years.
Providing care at home is expensive, with those surveyed reporting that they spent an average $364 a month for assistance with rent or mortgages for the elderly relative they were helping, and $322 a month for home care professionals. On average, caregivers helped with these expenses for two to six years, spending a total of $19,525 in out-of-pocket expenses.
Being responsible for an elderly relative can strain the health of those who work and provide such care, and result in missed days of work, early retirement and decreased effectiveness on the job. Almost three-fourths of those surveyed said that elder care had affected their health.
Sixty-two percent of those surveyed reporting asking supervisors, co-workers or management for some kind of support or help with their responsibilities at home. The support received was primarily informal, the survey said. Few companies provide formal support for employees who provide care for elderly relatives; only 23 percent of companies with 100 or more employees have programs in place to support elder care, the Families and Work Institute said.

HEADLINE: Malaysia Autocrat May Win Now but Lose Later

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS 

DATELINE: KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad is all but certain to win a parliamentary election next week, but already, to many people here, he seems like a relic of the past.
Campaigning against a disorganized and overmatched opposition, he is demanding -- and is likely to gain -- a vote of thanks on Monday for the stability and economic growth he has brought during his 18-year-old rule, the longest of any elected leader in Asia. 
 The goal of his opponents, however, is to make his expected victory seem like a loss. If his party falls below the symbolically dominant two-thirds majority it has always held in Parliament, politicians agree, it could drum him out of leadership at a party congress next year.
The campaign has been an exercise in raw political dominance by Dr. Mahathir, despite widespread public uneasiness over his actions in firing, trying and publicly humiliating his former deputy and heir apparent, Anwar Ibrahim.
But like other countries in the region, Malaysia has begun to outgrow the father-knows-best style of leadership that the 73-year-old Dr. Mahathir helped to promote under the label "Asian values." Like people in other Southeast Asian countries, Malaysians have grown more prosperous, better educated, better informed and more politically assertive.
"You have a more questioning electorate, no longer bound by the traditional mentality of accepting goodies from the government in exchange for their loyalty," said Husein Mutalib, an expert on Malaysia at the National University of Singapore. "For better or for worse, Mahathir's days are numbered."
The shift is part of a tide of political change that is sweeping through Southeast Asia, fueled by more than a decade of rapid economic growth and in some cases accelerated by the shock of the region's economic crisis during the last two years.
From the upheavals of Indonesia to the hard-fought constitutional changes of Thailand, strongman rule is giving way to the clamor and jostle of democracy.
"The key word is participation," said William J. Klausner, an American political scientist who teaches at Chulalongkorn University in Thailand. "It's the creation of alternative centers of power, whether they are nongovernmental organizations or the media or investigative reporting or bolder academic research."
"In one form or another, this is happening in all the countries in the region," he said. "People like Mahathir have to face up to this, face up to the fact that they can no longer operate unchallenged."
For now, Dr. Mahathir -- who was a practicing physician and is widely known here as "Dr. M" -- could be forgiven if he misses this point. With a crack of the whip and a shout through the bullhorn, he still has his people jumping through hoops.
The press and the airwaves belong to him. So does almost all of the country's political infrastructure. Much of Malaysia's wealth is his to distribute. When it counts, the police and the courts answer to his needs.
"Without authority and stability, there can be no civility," Dr. Mahathir argues in a recently published book, "A New Deal for Asia."
But even some of his strongest allies -- as once happened with the former Indonesian president, Suharto -- whisper that he has outstayed his welcome.
They are using the governing party's overwhelming dominance to keep the opposition on the run. But they are hearing the kinds of criticisms that also preceded Mr. Suharto's forced resignation in May 1998.
"We are seeing the last stages not only of Mahathir's rule but also of the type of leadership he represents," said Lim Guan Eng, a prominent opponent of the prime minister. "Whether he wins or not, the point is many Malaysians are fed up with the corruption, the abuses of power and the crony capitalism. He feels he can get away with anything he wants."
Though they have not run an effective campaign, Dr. Mahathir's mutually antagonistic political opponents -- an ethnic Chinese party, Islamic fundamentalists and liberal democrats -- have united for the first time in an attempt to capitalize on the growing discontent with his autocratic ways.
"I expect things to change no matter who wins," said M. G. G. Pillai, a political commentator. "The government has lost its right to dictate. The attitude has always been, 'You elected us, now shut up. We have the mandate.' That doesn't work any more."
The changes surfaced in Malaysia in 1997, when the region's economic crisis halted its decade-long growth spurt of 8 percent a year and made Dr. Mahathir's obsession with monumental building projects look foolish.
"That year was to be the apotheosis; Mahathir was to be taken up bodily into Valhalla," said Ronald Palmer, a former American ambassador here who now teaches at George Washington University in Washington, D.C. Malaysia was host to the Commonwealth games, it opened a new airport, it prepared to move the seat of government to a newly built city and it inaugurated the twin Petronas Towers, the world's tallest buildings.
When things went wrong, Dr. Mahathir turned his anger on the West, blaming George Soros and other currency traders, who he said were upset at his success.
Then, in September 1998, he shocked his countrymen by firing and shaming Mr. Anwar, 52, who has since been sentenced to six years in prison for corruption and is now on trial on charges of sexual misconduct.
That trial has been suspended during the election campaign, and few people here have any doubt that the intention was to remove Mr. Anwar from the public eye. The chief judge pleaded a backache.
"I don't like Anwar; I think he's just as much a rascal as the others, only better packaged," said Mr. Pillai, the political commentator. But in a commonly heard view, he added: "I support him because I don't want to see my deputy prime minister treated this way. If this can happen to my deputy prime minister, it can happen to me, and there'll be nobody to cry for me."
Discontent over the treatment of Mr. Anwar has divided the ethnic Malays who make up about 60 percent of the population. Dr. Maha thir's most solid support now comes from the Chinese minority of 30 percent and the Indians, who make up about 10 percent of the population.
Another key constituency worries the governing party: the young. Some political experts say Dr. Mahathir called an early election to keep at bay 680,000 newly registered voters who will not be eligible to take part until next year.
"It's generational, the ideas of liberalism, of wanting to chart Asia on a different course of participatory democracy," said Charles Santiago, who heads the Center for Economic and Social Research at Stamford College in Kuala Lumpur.
"There has been dissent in the past but not in the magnitude you see it right now," he said. "And that was because of prosperity. Prosperity has a certain co-opting tendency. But now people are waking up and saying, 'Wow, what's going on? What's happening to this poor country of ours?' "

Hong Kong Bounces Back, But Faces New Challenges

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, Nov. 26

 BODY:
In a report that made the Asian crisis seem like a distant memory, Hong Kong said today that its economy grew 4.5 percent in the third quarter of this year. The government also upgraded its forecast of growth for the full year to 1.8 percent from 0.5 percent.
The numbers, which were well above estimates, attest to Hong Kong's remarkable recovery from its worst recession since World War II. Like other Asian economies, Hong Kong has shrugged off the calamitous events of two years ago and is regaining its strength far faster than analysts had predicted. 
 "Hong Kong is poised for a dramatic rebound," said Victor Fung, the chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council. "The conditions were there, but we needed a strong confirmation and a boost to confidence. We've now had a whole series of such events."
In addition to the new data, Hong Kong has been buoyed in recent weeks by the Walt Disney Company's announcement that it would build a theme park here, by the successful debut of a government-linked investment fund, and by the landmark trade deal between the United States and China.
That last milestone, however, could prove to be a distinctly mixed blessing. As China opens up its economy in an effort to enter the World Trade Organization, analysts said, this former British colony could lose its prized role as the middleman between China and the outside world.
Nor is that the only cloud looming over Hong Kong. Today's numbers also show that the territory is caught in a deflationary spiral unique among the recovering economies of Asia. The consumer price index declined 3.9 percent in the first 10 months of 1999, and the government increased its projection of the full-year decline in the index to 4 percent from an earlier forecast of 3.5 percent.
Prices of everything from office space and imported wine to designer clothes and cars are plunging here. Although people are spending more in stores -- retail sales rose 2 percent in the third quarter -- they are lured by deep discounts. The number of tourists visiting Hong Kong is up 11 percent so far this year, but they are spending much less per person, economists said.
Much of this deflation is viewed as necessary. Hong Kong's prices were among the highest in the world, and made the territory a forbidding place to do business. But the falling prices are cutting profits at local companies, a trend that discourages them from resuming investment. "This is what I call a profitless recovery," said Dong Tao, an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in Hong Kong.
Mr. Tao said the recovery would remain tenuous as long as companies did not have the confidence to take out fresh loans and begin spending. Also, even though commercial rents have fallen by more than 40 percent, Hong Kong is still more expensive than New York or London, he said.
Ian K. Perkin, the chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce, said the government had masked the effect of weak corporate investment by starting several costly projects, including the $3.6 billion Disneyland, which will be built largely with public money.
"We have to persuade domestic companies to begin investing again -- and real investments, not just the stock market," Mr. Perkin said. "I don't know how we do that."
The new trade agreement between the United States and China is a more long-term challenge for Hong Kong. The government's economist, K. Y. Tang, said that it was premature to estimate what impact the deal would have on economic output. "In general terms, I agree with those who say that it must be a very positive development for both the mainland and Hong Kong," he said.
Mr. Fung, of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council, and others contend that Hong Kong will benefit from the agreement because it will generate vast new trading opportunities for China. As the world's largest container port and the main clearinghouse for Chinese exports, Hong Kong will get a share of that increased traffic.
But a growing number of experts are questioning whether Hong Kong will miss out on most of the new wealth. As China opens its markets to foreign companies and products, American and other foreign companies could start dealing directly with the mainland Chinese.
"Hong Kong has been very successful in exploiting the gray areas of doing business in China," said Jason Felton, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce here. "But the W.T.O. is going to force the Chinese to be more transparent. Hong Kong companies will lose that niche, and they are clearly worried about it."
Mr. Fung said the trade agreement would encourage hundreds of small and midsize American companies to try to crack the China market. Lacking the resources or connections of major corporations, these companies would need the advice of people in Hong Kong, he said.
"If you're talking about the Fortune 100, it's probably true that these companies will put increased emphasis on dealing directly with China," he said. "What I think we'll get is a rush of medium-size multinationals, who have heretofore not dealt with China."
Mr. Fung acknowledged that Hong Kong would be forced to change. But he predicted that the territory would remake itself -- much as it did in 1979, when Deng Xiaoping opened the Chinese economy. At that time, Hong Kong was a center for low-cost manufacturing. But companies here recognized that China would usurp that role, so they moved their factories to neighboring Guangdong Province.
Now, Mr. Fung said, Hong Kong needs to retool its economy to provide information-age services to the growing Chinese market. The territory has become a hothouse for Internet companies that are focusing on the mainland. On Thursday, in an effort to create a Nasdaq exchange for Asia, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange opened a second board for technology-related stocks.

HEADLINE: Personal Incomes in October Had LargestRise Since 1994

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Personal incomes in October rose at the fastest pace in five and a half years, bolstering consumer spending and paving the way for what may be the strongest holiday shopping season this decade.
"The economy is red hot, and consumers are out with money to spend," said Jeffrey Stone, president of Tweeter Home Entertainment Group Inc. of Canton, Mass., which operates Tweeter, Bryn Mawr and HiFi Buys electronics stores. 
 Incomes rose 1.3 percent in October after no change in September, the Commerce Department said. More than $5.5 billion in emergency government payments to farmers after passage of an agriculture spending bill by Congress contributed to last month's increase, as did union contract-signing bonuses.
Personal spending grew 0.6 percent last month, topping the 0.5 percent increase in September. Spending has risen at a 7.4 percent annual rate in the first 10 months of this year, compared with 6.8 percent a year earlier, and that is before today's start of the Christmas shopping season.
Spending of that magnitude is also likely to lift the nation's economy to a 5.5 percent annualized growth rate in the fourth quarter, the same rate as in the third quarter, according to economists at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates in Princeton, N.J. Consumer spending accounts for roughly two-thirds of the nation's output of goods and services.
Income in October was helped by union-led signing bonuses at the Boeing Company and for workers represented by the United Automobile Workers.
The October increase in personal incomes was the largest since a 1.3 percent increase in April 1994. Excluding the bonuses and subsidies, incomes rose 0.5 percent last month, Commerce officials said. That still would be the largest gain since 0.8 percent in June.
Spending on autos increased, according to the government numbers. Private-industry figures showed the sales pace slipped in October to an annual rate of 16.6 million units from 17.1 million units in September.
With consumers' incomes increasing, employment opportunities plentiful and inflation low, retailers have raised their expectations for the shopping season. Merchants said they expect retail sales to increase 4.4 percent over last year's holiday season and profits to rise 17 percent, according to a recent survey by the National Retail Federation and Deloitte & Touche. Reflecting optimism about holiday sales, the Standard & Poor's retail stores composite index -- representing 37 companies, including Wal-Mart, Gap and Circuit City -- is up more than 10 percent since the end of September.

HEADLINE: Free Trade, Up To a Point

BYLINE: By James V. Feinerman; James V. Feinerman is a law professor at Georgetown University.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It's usually smart to be wary of the hard sell. And the hard sell is what we will hear coming from Seattle next week, as the World Trade Organization meets there. The Clinton administration has been pushing for China's entry into the trade group, optimistically predicting immediate gains for American businesses. Markets will be opened, tariffs will be reduced and regulations will be loosened, we're told. W.T.O. membership, the administration claims, would transform China because its regulations, on trade and other matters, would become public and subject to foreign scrutiny.
Here's the catch: It may take a decade or more to reach that rosy result, if we reach it at all. In the short term, China's membership promises to be rocky, and any honest assessment should at least acknowledge the pitfalls ahead. A reality check should consider the following: 
 Myth: The agreement would quickly lower our trade deficit with China.
Fact: While the agreement would probably help our trade deficit in the long term, the deficit would be just as likely to grow in the short term. After all, the United States would also have to lower its own trade barriers, eliminating remaining tariffs and restrictions like environmental regulations, or risk being penalized.
Myth: Admission into the W.T.O. would force China to privatize its state-owned enterprises and open its telecommunications, banking and insurance markets to American companies.
Fact: It would take years to pry open China's markets. Why? Reformers must deal with other Chinese leaders who aren't interested in changing to a market economy and with lower-level bureaucrats who stymie orders from above. Then there is the sheer complexity of governing such a large and disparate country. Take, for example, our experience in trying to persuade China to strengthen intellectual property rights law. Over the last 12 years, we have had three memorandums of understanding with China, each trying to close loopholes. The United States has had some success in persuading China to draft its own intellectual property rights laws, and even to close an illegal factory or two. But over all, these changes haven't made a tremendous amount of difference. Indeed, even China's own reformers, including Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, can't force change. After two decades of reform, they now hope that international trade regulations will accomplish what they couldn't.
Myth: The trade agreement would force China to abide by our rules.
Fact: The Chinese would have as much influence on the W.T.O. as it does on them. Over the 13 years it has sought membership in the W.T.O. and its precedessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, China has indicated that it wants its voice heard on trade issues. Indeed, if China had been part of the negotiations in the early 1990's on intellectual property, the trade group's rules today might be far less protective of such interests. In the near future, China could well press for rules on labor and the environment that are far less stringent than what the United States wants.
Myth: The trade organization is the most efficient place to settle international disputes with China.
Fact: The Clinton administration presumes, perhaps rightly, that the vast majority of disputes between the two countries would be settled in favor of the United States. It also assumes that China would be likely to abide by W.T.O. decisions, because it wouldn't be just the United States pressuring China, but the 135 member nations. The downside is that every member country with a grievance against China would bring its own case to the trade group. The American market is already saturated with Chinese products; Europe and Japan have been much less receptive. A flood of Chinese imports in their stores could very well create friction. Right now, the trade organization handles fewer than 50 cases a year. If hundreds of disputes clogged the system, support for China and the W.T.O itself could disappear.
Despite all these problems, the decision to admit China to the trade group is a good one; it can only help global relations. But let's walk into this with our eyes wide open. President Clinton must be more candid about the extent of the problems and the time it will take to resolve them. Otherwise, at the first impasse, a backlash could undermine not only our relations with China, but also our support for free trade.

HEADLINE: California Gasoline Prices Are a Focus forRegulators

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Californians paid an average of about 26 cents more for a gallon of gasoline than other Americans in the first eight months of this year, according to a report released this week by the state's attorney general. And those high prices have become a focal point as federal and most state regulators prepare to approve the merger of Exxon and Mobil and continue to debate the acquisition of the Atlantic Richfield Company by BP Amoco.
Californians paid nearly $1.32 a gallon for regular gasoline from January through August, according to the attorney general's report. That was the third-highest price in the nation behind isolated Hawaii and Nevada, which gets much of its gasoline from California. Other Western states also have relatively high pricing. The national average excluding California was a little over $1.05 while in Georgia, which had the lowest prices, it was less than 89 cents. 
 Higher taxes accounted for about 5 cents of the difference and California's requirements for specially clean gasoline accounted for another 4 cents, the report said. But the main difference, it maintained, stems from concentration in the market, with more than 90 percent of the state's refinery capacity and the vast majority of its gasoline sales controlled by six big oil companies.
In other states, independent refiners and independent marketers tend to play a larger role in the market. And because of its need for special gasoline, California is basically cut off from sources of supply in the rest of the country. When the state's own refineries have problems -- such as occurred earlier this year -- gasoline prices can quickly spike.
The report did not find any wrong-doing by the oil companies, though it was not likely to since it looked only at publicly available information. But the issue of market concentration has become a key one in the pending oil mergers.
The Federal Trade Commission is expected to approve the merger of Exxon and Mobil next week, subject to the condition that they divest themselves of more than 2,000 gasoline stations, mainly on the East Coast, according to officials in Washington and elsewhere. In California, where the two companies together control 14 percent of refining capacity and nearly 19 percent of gasoline sales, about 360 gas stations are to be shed, along with Exxon's refinery in Benicia.
California is expected to go along with this decision but will have a veto over the purchasers of those stations and the refinery. That would ensure that the assets would not go to one of the existing participants in the California market.
The merger of BP Amoco and ARCO is still problematical because the two companies together would have formidable control over oil from Alaska's North Slope, which accounts for nearly half the oil refined in California.
Alaska has reached its own tentative agreement with BP Amoco and ARCO, calling for the divestiture of some North Slope production and leases. But that agreement does not satisfy California and other Western States, which are consumers of the oil, while Alaska's interests are partly to maximize its revenues from that oil.
"That only took care of Alaska's problems," Bill Lockyer, the California attorney general, said.
Earlier this month, Sir John Browne, the chief executive of BP Amoco, met with Gov. Gray Davis of California and promised that ARCO, which is based in Los Angeles, would retain its low-price gasoline sales strategy.
But Mr. Lockyer, the attorney general, said that did not go far enough.
Consumer groups and some California politicians have long made an issue of gasoline prices, particularly in San Diego and San Francisco, where prices are 6 cents to more than 20 cents a gallon higher than in Los Angeles. The Utility Consumers' Action Network, a San Diego consumer group, posts on its Web site a "gouge gap," the difference between San Diego and Los Angeles prices. The attorney general's report said the reasons for the differences are unclear; oil companies say the prices simply reflect market forces.
Consumer groups and some gasoline dealers have backed legislation in San Diego, San Francisco and in the California Legislature that would either forbid oil companies from owning gas stations or take other measures to give gas stations more supply options. But so far, none of these efforts have been successful.
Mike Libbey, a spokesman for Chevron, the largest refiner in the state, said the issue of gasoline prices "is all a red herring in terms of what most motorists are concerned with." He said Chevron had been gaining market share despite having relatively high prices and that consumers continued to buy gas-guzzling sport utility vehicles.
Mr. Libbey said that California environmental rules were chiefly responsible for the higher prices here.
Still, oil companies are fighting any proposed legislation. Chevron this month sent a letter to dealers saying it would have to double their rents if legislation such as that proposed in California, or in other states like Oregon and Arizona, became law. Chevron said this reflected economic realities, but some dealers said it was a heavy-handed attempt to silence them.
"What this basically says is, 'We'll put you out of business if you exercise your rights,' " said Dennis C. DeCota, executive director of the California Service Station and Automotive Repair Association.

Holiday Shopping Season Begins in Malls and on Web
As the holiday shopping season began the big question was not whether Americans would spend a lot of money -- sales of merchandise, are expected to reach $184 billion for November and December -- but where they will spend it: online or at the mall. Estimates for Web sales run as high as $12 billion. 
 Early spot reports indicated that e-shopping is fast becoming as much a holiday tradition as strolling the concourse. And at least on the first day after Thanksgiving, there were also sporadic reports of service trouble on the Web (KBkids.com was down for much of the day and was offering $5 off coupons to appease consumers), while traditional merchants were doing a better-than-expected job of making visitors comfortable. Page A12.
 
Exxon-Mobil Approval Expected
Antitrust officials at the Federal Trade Commission have notified the states that they intend to recommend the approval of Exxon's $81 billion acquisition of Mobil next week. The move came after the companies agreed to the largest divestiture in the commission's history. At the same time, federal and some state officials have raised serious antitrust questions about BP Amoco's proposed $29 billion purchase of Atlantic Richfield. A1.

HEADLINE: Busy Season Begins for Merchants

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Ed and Kathy Blasco kicked off their holiday shopping today the same way they have for the last 15 years: they headed for the Country Club Plaza in Kansas City. The Blascos were set to enjoy the balmy weather and the Christmas songs being played by a live band, but they did not plan to make many purchases.
"If we get ideas today, we may very well do online shopping," Mr. Blasco said. 
 They intended to take advantage of an online retailer's free shipping offer on a playground set for their 1-year-old granddaughter and said they had already bought a doll on Ebay.com.
With unemployment at record lows and the stock market flying high, economists and retail analysts have been predicting that Christmas 1999 will be very strong indeed. Sales of merchandise, excluding autos, will reach $184 billion for November and December, up 6 percent from last year, predicts the National Retail Federation. So the real issue is not whether Americans will shop, but where. The Internet is growing rapidly, and estimates vary on just how big a chunk the virtual vendors will divert from stores. Estimates of holiday sales on the Web run from $6 billion by Forrester Research to $12 billion by Ernst & Young, numbers that are comparatively small, but at least twice last year's.
The day after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday because merchants historically have relied on sales leading up to Christmas to move them from the red into the black, is no longer the busiest shopping day of the year. (That honor is now held by the days nearest Christmas Eve, as Americans conditioned to sale shopping delay buying as long as possible.) Still, the Thanksgiving weekend does send millions of families to the mall and provides a snapshot of how the season will shape up.
Early reports indicate that online shopping is fast becoming as much a holiday tradition as strolling along eating chestnuts and gawking at decorated store windows. And at least on the first day of the holiday shopping season, there were sporadic reports of service trouble on the Web (KBkids.com was down much of the day and offering $5 off coupons to appease consumers), while merchants on the ground were doing a better than expected job of making visitors comfortable.
At Crate & Barrel's flagship store on Michigan Avenue in Chicago, there were more clerks than people at 10 a.m., including a full-time janitorial staff that was meticulously polishing escalators and handrails almost the minute they were marred by fingerprints.
Kay Barker, of Carmel, Calif., who was visiting Manhattan, stocked up on perfume and sweaters at Bloomingdale's and then waited while her son tried on clothes at Banana Republic. She was like many other shoppers in offering praise of New York sales clerks. "The personnel have been very patient with all the crowds," Ms. Barker said.
Despite heightened attention to customer service and warm weather that encouraged shopping outdoors, many Americans still chose to stay home and bathe in the light of their computer screens, much to the delight of cybermerchants.
"From what we can tell by traffic to our Web site as of noon, today will be the No. 1 day for our Web site all year," said Mike Goldstein, chief executive of Toys "R" Us. Amazon.com, which sells books, music and toys, reported a sales increase of 267 percent over Black Friday last year. And Richard Rogowski, a spokesman for Yahoo!, said, "This is our biggest day of the year so far. We are getting almost five times as many orders on Yahoo! stores as we got last year on Black Friday."
At Outpost.com, a supplier of high-technology gifts, big sellers included DVD players and flat-screen computer monitors. "It is very darn good this week," said Bob Bowman, Outpost's chief executive. "We already have orders exceeding last year. We will do north of a million today."
Consumers were drawn, Mr. Bowman said, by the offer of free overnight shipping and a promotion that rewarded a shopper every 15 minutes with a gift appropriate for Internet surfing, like a bathrobe and a pretzel-popcorn snack.
But the increased traffic did not come without a price. In the week leading up to Black Friday, many Web shoppers complained that sites were responding slowly and that some did not take orders at all. Among the most troubled were the toy sites, with Toys "R" Us and Etoys having down time during the week, and KBKids.com suffering badly today.
Because Internet retailers must ship goods, they tend to hit their Christmas peak a little earlier than traditional merchants, who can provide cash-and-carry gratification. Perhaps this explains why reports from stores were mostly positive but a bit mixed.
"It was a slow start, to tell you the truth, because there was not one big toy this season," John Konarski, president of the International Council of Shopping Centers, said this morning. "There was no reason to get up at 4:30 in the morning and wait on line."
Consumers strolling the avenues in the big urban centers reported that they had every intention of spending lots of money and plenty of it in plain old stores. And there were signs everywhere that retailers were not going to cede sales readily. Many stores were already promoting big markdowns, and in what may be a service emphasis inspired by a fear of the Internet, most had salespeople clamoring to help browsers.
Sue and Brad Briddell, who traveled from Toledo, Ohio, to shop in Chicago, had only praise for the service they had found on Michigan Avenue. The two had been out of their hotel and on the hunt by 7:30 a.m., and by mid-morning had already visited Marshall Field's and Old Navy and had fingered the parachute flight pants at Express. The couple did not find the stereotypical scarce or gruff sales help. Both said they had been served well.
"Oh, it has been fantastic," Ms. Briddell said. "Everyone's been very up and very friendly."
Whether stores can maintain that first-day polish will be the question as the shopping season gathers steam.
The Web's popularity might be changing the world of shopping, but certain things remain constant online or off. Discounted merchandise or anything Pokemon was a good thing today.
Jeff Tauber, chairman and chief executive of Cybershop, an online merchant specializing in toys, apparel and housewares, said, "We are definitely exceeding last year's numbers, and this day last year was one of our top three or four days of the entire year. People are always looking for a good deal."
Among Cybershop's specials was a $99 bundle of Pokemon paraphernalia, including trading cards, the coveted Pikachu plush animal, a pencil set and a key chain.
In Atlanta, more than 50 shoppers rushed to the electronics department to buy Pokemon items when Target, the low-price division of Dayton Hudson, opened its doors at 7 a.m. While shopping at Target, Starla Littleton and her niece Shelly Park used walkie-talkies to make their trip more efficient.
"She goes to get one thing, and I go to get another," Ms. Littleton said. They kept in touch as one checked out the Pokemon display and the other headed to the Furbie Babies.
Meanwhile, the department stores, which offer mid-range prices and few toys, were rather empty before midday. Diana Brown, who was shopping at Barney's in New York with a couple of girlfriends, said that just before her excursion she had heard that today was Black Friday. "We thought, 'Oh, no,' " Ms. Brown said. "But it's not bad at all."
Cathy Joiner, of Nashville, who was fingering Pashmina shawls at the Bloomingdale's on 59th Street, while her husband, Don, looked on, said, "I was here last year, and it was a whole lot worse than this."
But if the fashionable clothiers were worried, they did not admit it. In sales, "we are up double digit above last year," said Judy Collinson, the Barney's Inc. general merchandise manager for women's wear, "and we don't even expect this to be one of our biggest days."
Ms. Collinson said that luxury items selling well included Fendi purses, shearling jackets and Pashmina shawls, which run up to $3,000 for the hand-embroidered variety.
"Our customers purchase things on the Internet," Ms. Collinson said firmly, "but not the things they buy from us."

HEADLINE: State Subsidies to Hospitals Face Renewal Deadline, Spurring Policy Debate

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
New York hospitals are being suffocated, according to one viewpoint, by the government and by insurance companies that place profits perilously above patients' needs. Or, from another vantage point, the hospitals are hopelessly inefficient spendthrifts whose practices have not kept pace with cost-cutting trends in health care.
Administrators running the hospitals say they are Dickensian institutions, reeling from federal and state budgets cuts, barely able to eke out a profit. They are places where nurses frantically toil to take care of wards crowded with patients, and where doctors waste precious time fighting with managed-care companies. To make matters worse, administrators argue, state business leaders want to abandon their critical role of paying high medical-insurance premiums to help these hospitals absorb the costs of caring for the poorest and sickest, and Congress is taking away precious teaching dollars. 
 Health insurance companies and business groups counter that health care costs in New York State are nearly 20 percent higher than in the rest of the country, fueled in large part by hospitals in the city that they see as temples of medical arrogance and fiscal insouciance. Too many specialists, eager to try out their latest costly toys, hospitalize people for problems that could be solved in a doctor's office, and labor leaders, loath to lose a single job, resist the closing of the most under-used hospitals, the business argument goes.
The two sides have been at the heart of protracted debates over how to fix New York hospitals' ailing financial picture. And their characterizations of the health care system and its troubles and expenses, however contradictory they seem, are both accurate. New York hospitals ended 1998 with operating losses of $115 million, according to figures released this week. Yet their traditions are deeply embedded, so much so that long-term solutions to stem those losses have eluded experts for years.
This year, the people who provide health care and those who pay for it are finding themselves at a crucial juncture as they prepare to do battle with the State Legislature over the future of state health care financing, because the state's Health Care Reform Act expires at the end of next month. Further, teaching hospitals stand to lose tens of millions of dollars in Medicare money under a new Congressional budget bill.
If the Health Care Reform Act is not renewed, hospitals will lose a large portion of their state funds. So parties on all sides are scrambling to devise ways to deal legislatively with two significant and incendiary portions of the law: paying to educate medical students, which in New York is a huge and prestigious business, and covering the hospital bills of the state's poor uninsured patients, which is a huge burden.
Hospital and labor organizations have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on an advertising campaign expressing outrage at plans to cut the amount of money devoted to health care. And business leaders have raced around the state in recent months trying to convince anyone who will listen that it is time for someone else -- they have not specified whom -- to start footing the bills.
Both sides hope to influence any plan that Gov. George E. Pataki may have.
The reasons why the city's hospitals and the health care industry arrived at this point are many and varied, and to a great extent, are rooted in some obvious economic realities. Almost everything in New York, from electricity to labor to peanut butter, costs more than it does in the rest of the country. Thousands of people in the state are uninsured, and the health care system in New York City reinforces the outmoded practice of placing teaching hospitals front and center for even the most basic care.
At the same time, the Medicare and charity pools that historically combined to allow the state to build top-notch medical centers while also serving its poorest residents have either dried up or been threatened, while managed care companies have tightened the reimbursement screws.
"The hospitals' story about being broke is fundamentally accurate," said James R. Tallon, the president of the United Hospital Fund, a health care research and philanthropic organization. Insurers' arguments that hospitals could be more efficient are "also legitimate," he added.
"There is room for more efficient use of resources across the board," Mr. Tallon said. "But the question is, are you going to achieve that in a fair fashion?"
For decades, hospitals in New York, like those in many other areas of the country, enjoyed prosperity. Through a combination of the federal Medicare program and a state plan that paid for educating doctors, hospitals could afford to eat the costs of the uninsured while building many highly esteemed medical centers and training thousands of residents, many in highly specialized areas that attracted people from around the country to New York hospitals.
But in the last several years, a confluence of events reined in the flow of cash. Governor Pataki made major cuts in the state's Medicaid program, which pays for care for the poor, while Congress pulled back on Medicare, which primarily pays for care for retirees and disabled people.
At the same time, a state system that set the rates that insurers paid hospitals ended at Mr. Pataki's behest, forcing hospitals to start negotiating $16 billion a year in charges with the insurers. This freed health maintenance organizations to vastly decrease their reimbursement rates to the hospitals.
All the while, the ranks of the uninsured swelled. Suddenly, hospitals found themselves competing for patients and making budget cuts, anathema just a decade ago. Add on the high cost of labor -- which health care financing experts says is 70 percent of health care costs -- and the system has become more expensive while less profitable.
The state's method of paying hospitals for care they give essentially free is also unorthodox, coming in the form of an 8 percent surcharge on every hospital and laboratory bill. Businesses find this practice unfair because they feel it is ultimately passed to them in insurance rate increases. But that pool of money helps to cover the state's three million uninsured, who tend to seek almost all their care in hospitals, and many medical centers, especially the New York City public hospital system, say that they could not survive without this subsidized public service.
In any other industry -- say, retail -- the competition that results from tight times creates fallout. In New York City, Macy's and Bloomingdale's have survived. Bonwit Teller and A.& S. have closed. But New York has yet to close hospitals, and indeed many centers have expanded, reasoning that they need to offer comprehensive cancer centers and top-notch cardiac care to compete for patients.
"It is starting to look like the collapse of the Soviet empire," said Megan McAndrew Cooper, the editor of the Dartmouth Atlas, which tracks regional variations in health care. "Everyone in New York had to have the best of everything. There was no cooperative planning or constraint on resources, and now all of a sudden reimbursements get cut back and they are left supporting incredible overhead with no income. Things are getting very wobbly."
In fact, while New York has greatly reduced the number of days people stay in the hospital (that figure is still higher than the national average), the number of hospitals has not decreased. "If you have too many hospital beds, getting someone out of one earlier just frees up the bed for someone else," Ms. Cooper said. "What they should be doing is admitting fewer patients."
Further, the trend in medicine in the 1990's has been to do more procedures and treatments outside the hospital, in doctor's offices or even in the home. But in New York City, 82 Medicare patients out of 1,000 are still treated in the hospital for things that could be done in an ambulatory center; in San Francisco, that number is 51.
Hospital administrators and doctors contend that they have worked hard to move a huge system into the future, and add that it is infuriating to hear arguments about how they should be treating fewer patients when the number of uninsured patients in the state has risen at a far faster rate than in the rest of the country, and managed care companies are whittling down payments.
"We may not be 100 percent there," said Ruth Levin, vice president in charge of managed care for Continuum Health Partners, parent to Beth Israel and St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.
But it does not help hospitals' efficiency when insurance firms "call us every day to remind us what the doctors should be doing," she said.
"Actually, it costs us a lot of money," she said. "I have eight nurses who do nothing but communicate with managed care companies."
This circles back to the sticky issue of doctors. New York trains them by the thousands; the doctor to population ratio in New York is about 50 percent higher than in the rest of the country. And the state has far more specialists: 175 per 100,000 residents, compared with a national average of 122 per 100,000.
While all states receive some Medicare money to pay for educating doctors, each has its own system of supplementing that pot. Many, including New York, use a portion of Medicaid dollars. But New York has a unique system under which employers pay a state tax based on the number of teaching hospitals in their region, a charge reflected in higher medical insurance premiums.
"No one in the country has a system of taxing businesses to train doctors," argues Elliott Shaw, the director of government affairs for the New York Business Council, which would like to see this portion of the Health Care Reform Act eliminated.
But supporters of this system, unusual and costly as it is, argue that training doctors has economic and social benefits for the state, because fine teaching hospitals attract patients from around the world. "It is a cost well worth paying," said State Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, chairman of the State Assembly Committee. "The local economy benefits because one person's decision to come to our hospital for a surgery is worth $100,000 to the local economy. And graduate medical education is also a way we pay for a lot of health care for the uninsured, because a lot of what residents do is provide uncompensated care."
And so it may be that while New York's costs are extremely high, the argument over whether to help keep hospitals afloat could center on shifts in the mind-sets on both sides of the debate. Should people in less-populated areas of Brooklyn be forced to travel an hour to a hospital because their local center fell to insolvency, as people do, say, in remote areas of North Dakota? Can young people in medical school adapt to the notion of becoming family doctors instead of super sub-specialists, and how would that affect the popularity of some of the more renowned hospitals? And where is the policy proposal for the city's ranks of uninsured?
"You always have to be careful about applying market forces in health care," Mr. Gottfried said, "because the values of the marketplace say if something isn't a profit center we cut it out. And in health care there are things we need that are not profitable. People are trying to figure out how to change their internal culture here. It is complicated."

HEADLINE: 45 Arrested in a Protest Against Capitalism

BYLINE: By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN 

 BODY:
Four days before the World Trade Organization is to convene in Seattle to lay the groundwork for a global round of trade negotiations, about 400 young anti-capitalists held a roving protest in Manhattan yesterday afternoon that blocked traffic and resulted in 45 arrests.
The event, called "Buy Nothing Day," was staged by members of an international group, Reclaim the Streets, to oppose the traditional consumer frenzy on the day after Thanksgiving. 
 Wearing ties with images of dollar bills, pink feather boas and face paint, the protesters denounced corporate globalization, environmental destruction and consumerism, and passed out Chinese cookies with messages like "Globalize Liberation, Not Corporate Power."
The protesters, who did not have a permit, moved continually to avoid the police. They started in Union Square at 14th Street, moved to Times Square and continued to Bryant Park at 42nd Street and Avenue of the Americas, as organizers moved them along with an air horn.
The demonstration stopped traffic at Broadway and 44th Street for about 40 minutes, group leaders estimated.
The group opposes the World Trade Organization's summit meeting, demonstrators said, because the W.T.O.'s leaders are not democratically elected, yet make economic decisions that affect health, safety and the environment.
One protester, Tim Santamour of Brooklyn, said, "In a week, the World Trade Organization will decide some huge economic issues without asking us -- just corporations and C.E.O.'s."
At Bryant Park, Ross Bingham, 36, a caterer and social worker, said of multinational corporations: "You can't control them. They're above the law of the country and they do what they please."
Another protester, who gave his name as Pogo and wore a red clown nose with orange wig, said that he was demonstrating against "the loss of individual and community power to corporations."
Standing in Times Square, where most of the 45 arrests on disorderly conduct charges were made, he added that the area had come to symbolize the takeover of neighborhoods by corporations.
Reclaim the Streets was formed in London in 1991 to protest the creation of new highways. Since then, the group has branched out and, according to a leaflet, has attracted "ecologists, anti-road activists, squatters, artists" and even "fire breathers."
Protesters yelled, "Unnecessary force, unnecessary force," as police officers carried them away from Times Square with their hands bound behind their backs with plastic handcuffs.
One protester clambered to the top of a 25-foot-high tripod as the crowd cheered. Police officers pulled him down and arrested him.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: CURRENCIES;
Euro Declines to Record Lows Against Dollar, Pound and Yen

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Nov. 26

 BODY:
Defying predictions of accelerated growth in Europe, Europe's single currency sank to record lows today against the American dollar, the British pound and the Japanese yen.
In a move with tremendous symbolic value, Europe's 11-month-old euro slipped to barely one penny above one-to-one parity with the dollar. 
 The euro was introduced at nearly $1.18 on Jan. 4 amid buoyant enthusiasm about new opportunities in Europe's unified market. Today, the euro sank as low as $1.0076 before closing at $1.0156.
Though the decline was not in itself alarming, it provided yet another reminder of Europe's nagging economic problems and its inability to match the relentless growth of the United States.
The euro also hit record lows against the British pound, which is certain to aggravate the new wave of hostility within Britain about joining the European currency union.
The euro's most drastic decline has been against the Japanese yen, which has climbed sharply against all major currencies and is now about 30 percent higher against the euro than it was in January.
The euro's problems have repeatedly defied investors' expectations. At the time it was introduced, the euro seemed so strong that some economists and political leaders worried about its climbing so high that it might make European exports too expensive.
Instead, the euro sank throughout the first six months of its life and came quite close to parity with the dollar back in June. The euro then recovered part of its lost ground, a rebound partly attributed to signs of new economic growth and to speculators who were convinced that the euro was poised for a big bounce.
Europe's economy has indeed perked up in recent months, but it is still growing much more slowly than that of the United States. The United States economy expanded at a surprisingly strong rate of 5.5 percent in the third quarter of this year. By contrast, growth in the 11-nation euro zone is about 2.5 percent this year and is expected to reach about 3 percent next year.
Analysts said the euro had also been hobbled by growing skittishness among Japanese investors, who have seen the value of euro-denominated stocks and bonds plunge as a result of the yen's surge.
The European Central Bank added to that skittishness on Wednesday, when top officials said they would do nothing to shore up the euro against the yen.
On top of that, many currency traders who bet on a strong recovery in the euro last summer are now selling euros to adopt a more neutral stance relative to other currencies.
"This isn't about economic growth or this week's economic numbers," Michael Saunders, European economist at Salomon Smith Barney in London, said. "This is about investors trying to reduce their risks before year-end and trying to get back to neutral positions."
Officials at the European Central Bank, which governs monetary policy in the euro zone, made it clear this week that they would not try to shore up the euro through their trading operations.
Eugenio Domingo Solans, the bank's board member in charge of international issues, said on Thursday that the bank had no intention of intervening to prevent the euro from sinking below parity against the dollar.
And Wim Duisenberg, the European bank's president, in an interview published today in The Financial Times, reiterated his long-held position that the euro's exchange rate is only important if it fuels inflation.
"Does the actual movement give rise to concern?" Mr. Duisenberg asked rhetorically. "The answer is no. It doesn't matter very much."
But even Mr. Duisenberg admitted to "some concern" about perceptions created by a falling euro. "A continued further movement in this direction would contribute to undermining the confidence in the euro," he said. "Unjustified, but still it is a public perception."
In Brussels, officials at the European Commission said the euro's decline was attributable merely to strong economic data in the United States rather than to fundamental weaknesses in Europe.
"It's the strength of the dollar rather than the weakness of the euro that has led to these developments in the past few days," said Gerassimos Thomas, a commission spokesman.
Japanese central bankers and investors may well be the most worried about the euro. The extraordinary surge of the yen against the euro threatens to strangle Japanese exports to Europe because Japanese goods cost more in European currencies.
Although euro notes and coins will not enter circulation until 2002, the euro trades in the financial markets, and the existing currencies of the euro-member countries have been permanently locked to the value of the euro.
Haruhiko Kuroda, a senior official at the Japanese Finance Ministry, was quoted by Reuters today as saying that the euro's fall was unjustified. Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has previously said that Japan is ready to intervene if necessary, and the Bank of Japan did in fact intervene, with assistance from the European Central Bank, earlier this summer.
Some analysts have speculated that the euro has been hurt by recent political machinations in Germany. In the last week, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany has inveighed against Vodafone AirTouch's hostile takeover bid against Mannesmann, giving rise to fears that Germany might try to block certain types of mergers.
Mr. Schroder started another round of controversy on Wednesday, when he orchestrated a $2.2 billion bailout ofa huge but woefully mismanaged construction company, Philipp Holzmann A.G.
But most economists say the euro's problems are rooted in more mundane issues. They note that many institutions increased their stocks of euro-denominated assets in the summer, convinced that the euro had hit bottom.
But as the end of the year approaches, they said, investors are shifting back to a neutral stance -- which means selling euros.
"People are very uncertain about what the correct level of the euro should be," Jens Dallmeyer, an economist at Deutsche Bank Research in Frankfurt, said. "The boom in the United States is still alive and kicking and everyone can feel it. But people are still waiting for hard evidence of an economic upswing in Europe."

 THE HUNGRY YEARS
 A Narrative History of the
 Great Depression in America.
 By T. H. Watkins.
 Illustrated. 587 pp. New York:
 A Marian Wood Book/
 Henry Holt & Company. $32.50. 
 The 1930's is the first American decade remembered chiefly with the eyes. Images of men in soup lines, mothers in migrant camps, veterans marching on Washington, strikers sitting down in auto plants and one ever-buoyant president tend to overshadow debates about the merits of the New Deal and why the Great Depression lasted long enough to earn its adjective. Most authors who write broad surveys of the period evoke the visual references, or seek to tell a different kind of story.
In "The Hungry Years," T. H. Watkins, a former editor of Wilderness magazine who now teaches history at Montana State University, attempts to do both. With richly graphic detail, he refreshes old accounts about the misery and insurgencies of the decade. Then he departs from the familiar to devote the last third of the text to the wrenching fortunes of rural America, a subject few historians of the 30's have found worthy of their sustained attention. The result is a set of discrete narratives, most about ordinary Americans, that often shine as literary performance but are ultimately unsatisfying as an interpretation of the period.
Like the great documentary photographers of the era, Watkins is an empathetic connoisseur of the particular. He is especially good at describing flaws in the execution of New Deal programs, whose intentions he generally applauds. Writing about the Civilian Conservation Corps, he points out the high desertion rate (near 20 percent), the prevalence of food riots and the extreme difficulty black Southerners had getting enrolled at all. He praises the Tennessee Valley Authority for bringing electrical power and jobs to rural Southerners. But building those huge T.V.A. dams, he notes, meant the destruction of numerous homes and villages. "I don't want to move," an East Tennessee woman in her 70's said. "I want to sit here and look out over these hills where I was born. My folks are buried down the road a piece and our babies are over there on the hill under the cedars."
Watkins's informed reverence for the natural world illumines his chapters on agrarian history. Whether explaining the drought that created the Dust Bowl or the slaughter of pigs by farmers desperate to raise the price of meat, he mingles evidence of human foibles and struggles with a sense of awe about the land. During the mid-30's, he writes, the unremitting wind from the plains "came down on all that exposed and crippled land, scooped up hundreds of millions of tons of it as dust, then boiled it all up into choking clouds that rolled across entire states and at least twice . . . sailed so high into the jet stream that airborne earth . . . darkened Eastern cities in the daytime and dusted the decks of trans-Atlantic liners." Such passages suggest how environmentalists have begun to alter the conventions of historical narrative, making political actors seem more like Sisyphus and less like Caesar.
Still, the Depression did touch off a political upheaval, and Watkins is not a fully reliable guide through its complexities. His penchant for the dramatic leads him to overemphasize the extent of organized resistance from the left. The unionists of the new Congress of Industrial Organizations were a critical force, but Watkins's lavish attention to them implies that they represented most workers at the time. In fact, the older, more conservative American Federation of Labor was never "in an unaccustomed subordinate position," as he claims. Jolted by the competition with its upstart rival, the A.F.L. signed up more new members than did the C.I.O., and helped steer the labor movement away from the anticapitalist stance espoused by radical organizers.
Watkins also inflates the significance of the Communist Party as an instigator of grass-roots rebellion and scants other insurgent voices who spoke for millions. He carefully charts each shift in policy by home-grown Leninists but neglects the sources and consequences of the huge, if short-lived, populist movements led by Charles Coughlin, Huey Long and Francis Townsend. At times, Watkins suggests that the country was on the brink of revolution. Yet the real contest was between an unsteady coalition of reformers and pragmatic radicals on one side and conservatives in both major parties who loathed the New Deal.
Focusing almost entirely on stories about collective anger also misses a sober reality about the Depression: millions of suffering Americans, spawn of an individualist culture, blamed themselves for their plight. They had assumed that the consumer-driven prosperity of the 1920's would only expand and did not recover easily or quickly from the shock of economic collapse. The familial crisis of the 30's was as profound as the political one, as marriages frayed and teenagers left home in search of work. The hunger for security under paternal leadership did much to keep Franklin Roosevelt in power, gaining him votes even from citizens who were troubled by the expansion of government during his long years in office. The coming of World War II did more than end the Depression by creating millions of jobs, for those in and out of uniform. It also liberated Americans from an epidemic of self-doubt.
"The Hungry Years" certainly has a great deal to offer readers unfamiliar with the history of the 30's. And Watkins's prose often has the intensity and warmth of a photo by Dorothea Lange or a novel by John Steinbeck, artists whom the author clearly admires. At a time when most Americans learn about the past by watching large and small screens, a historian who can write so vividly ought to find a wide audience.
The book ends with the author's childhood memory of the day Pearl Harbor was bombed. After the radio announced news of the Japanese attack, his mother went to his room and methodically checked each of his toys to see where it had been manufactured. Then "she started a fire with some trash and a big kitchen match, and when it was going well handed me some of the toys. . . . As she tossed in each 'Made in Japan' toy, so did I, one at a time, until they were all consumed or shriveled."
It's a pity that Watkins rarely steps back from telling his fine story, or rather group of stories, to point out any larger meaning. If his interpretive gifts equaled his narrative ones, he might have produced a masterpiece.

Development As Freedom
 By Amartya Sen.
 366 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50. 
 A MARTYA SEN was an odd choice for the Nobel in economic science in 1998. In a field increasingly obsessed with narrow technical virtuosity, Sen has persisted in asking big, messy questions, mixing ethics with his equations. The choice was also unusual because, unlike most Nobel laureates, he was not associated with a single grand idea -- a "killer theorem," in the language of the field -- having written across a range of topics, even disciplines. But with his new book, "Development as Freedom," Sen, who is Master of Trinity College, Cambridge, has brought together many of his ideas and put them under one theoretical umbrella.The result is a somewhat disjointed work, part collected essays, part magnum opus.
If there is an underlying theme in Sen's work -- and it takes up a few chapters here -- it is skepticism that money is the measure of all things. He has persistently posed this question: What do we mean when we say that a person or a group or a country is better off? The conventional answer -- higher incomes -- is not enough for Sen. He points out that many places with low per capita incomes, like Sri Lanka, China and the Indian state of Kerala, have achieved higher life expectancies and literacy rates than much richer lands like Brazil, South Africa and Namibia. In fact the people of these poor countries (and there are others, like Costa Rica and Gabon) can expect to live longer than some groups in industrial countries, like American black men, who in monetary terms are much richer. Sen recognizes that in most countries higher incomes do produce improvements across most measures of the quality of life. But in looking at the exceptions he forces us to examine the connection between income and well-being, between money and happiness.
Some of the other chapters contain reprises of Sen's justly famous studies. Perhaps his best-known paper argues that democracy is crucial to the prevention of famine and points out the striking fact that there has never been a famine in a functioning multiparty democracy. Another makes vivid the neglect of women's health in Asia and North Africa by calculating the number who are "missing" -- that is, who would have lived if given the same care and attention as men; it is close to 100 million.
Another chapter, more polemical than scholarly, rejects claims made by Singapore's founding prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, and others that development in poor countries often requires tough decisions and the ability to delay gratification, both of which generally require ignoring popular pressures. Sen observes that this analysis rests on the success of a few East Asian countries, not the full range of autocracies, many of which have proved to be disastrous at economic development. He correctly notes that more complete studies are inconclusive as to whether, on average, dictatorships outperform democracies. To put it simply, if a country gets an autocrat there's no way of ensuring that the autocrat will be Lee Kuan Yew and not Mobutu Sese Seko.
But Sen is much too dismissive of the interesting case of East Asia's "tigers." They are, after all, the only third world countries to move from poverty to near plenty -- and in one generation! It might be worth considering, for instance, that these countries adopted more free-market-oriented policies than other third world countries did, policies that were wildly unpopular until very recently. The easiest way to win an election in South Asia or Africa during the 1960's and 1970's was to brand your opponent a capitalist.
Sen lauds the East Asians for investing in human capital through health care and education because these policies not only produced growth but also improved people's quality of life. But again, in most third world countries organized political and labor groups insisted on a very different course. They demanded large-scale employment projects, often through nationalization; huge subsidies; and tariff protection for local industries. Politically powerful farmers prevented land reform and other interest groups still block cuts in subsidies and deregulation. In Chile, for example, it was Pinochet's military government that pushed through the land reform policies of the socialist Salvador Allende. Today central planning is in disfavor and capitalism seems irresistible, so perhaps good economics also makes for good politics. But this has not always been so and may not be so in the future.
Sen's claims for democracy, however, are not really about economic performance. He argues that democratic government is an end in and of itself because it furthers human freedom. This is a powerful, well-established statement that few would disagree with. Sen places it at the center of his overall theoretical framework. But this governing idea, which takes up several chapters, has neither the originality nor the power of Sen's more specific insights.
Development, for Sen, is the process of expanding human freedom -- hence his book's title. Raising peoples' incomes is important, he says, but so is giving them political rights like the ability to choose their governments and express themselves without fear. Fair enough. But freedom for Sen goes well beyond providing people with basic political and civil rights. True freedom -- "substantive freedom" is his term -- requires "economic facilities," "social opportunities" and "protective security" -- in other words, state-funded jobs, services and income subsidies for the less successful in society.
Now this might strike many as a familiar argument for redistribution, and one that has been accepted by most industrial societies -- they all underwrite some version of the welfare system Sen seems to be advocating. The philosophical rationale for this setup was also made, comprehensively and brilliantly, almost 30 years ago by John Rawls in "A Theory of Justice." Sen believes he is different from Rawls, and more radical, but in ways that strike me as quibbles. Sen considers his theoretical innovation to be his expansive definition of substantive freedom as whatever helps human beings fully exercise their capabilities -- "or, less formally put, the freedom to achieve various lifestyles." He criticizes Rawls for giving priority to the narrower, traditional conception of liberty -- freedom from physical or mental coercion. "Why should the status of intense economic needs," Sen asks, "which can be matters of life and death, be lower than that of personal liberties?"
But Sen's is hardly an original definition. T. H. Green wrote of "true freedom," in 1881, as "the maximum power for all members of human society alike to make the best of themselves." And he was far from the first to propose this kind of broad conception of liberty. But if one seeks the redistribution of wealth or the promotion of egalitarianism or any other such value, why call it freedom? At the very least it confounds plain discourse. And at worst, it can lead to the neglect of basic liberties in the search for more extravagant ones. Philosophers like Rawls and Isaiah Berlin, hardly libertarians, give priority to personal liberties for good historical reasons; over the centuries, governments have routinely abused them, often justifying coercion by claiming to be fulfilling some positive vision of freedom.
In awarding Sen his prize, the Swedish Academy of Sciences noted that he had "restored an ethical dimension to the discussion of vital economic problems." He has done this and more. His book is rich in insight and moral imagination. Sen raises more questions than he answers. He almost always handles thorny choices by declaring that we must balance values, even when they are, as they often are, competing. So much of his high intelligence is devoted to moving between subjects and fields -- a little public choice theory here and a little moral philosophy there -- that the book has a discursive and diffuse quality. "Development As Freedom" has neither the comprehensiveness of the best political philosophy nor the elegance of the best economics. It makes one long for a killer theorem.

To the Editor:
In his review of "In Praise of Hard Industries: Why Manufacturing, Not the Information Economy, Is the Key to Future Prosperity" (Sept. 12), James K. Galbraith says that the argumentation in my book is sometimes "daft": "In two places Fingleton asserts that the high-tech hotshots who make so much money in San Jose are so bright that they could do equally well in, let us say, Akron, if only they chose to move there. So why didn't they?" In reality what I say is quite different -- that "in a manufacturing-based economy" (by which it is clear I am talking about an economy like that of Japan), intelligent and capable workers can expect to earn at least as high wages in manufacturing as in postindustrial services. 
 In challenging my evaluation of how far the United States has fallen behind its foreign competitors in advanced manufacturing, Galbraith cites Boeing as a counterexample. I happen to know from personal experience that Boeing is quite defensive about how hollowed out it has become. Its embarrassment is understandable. Remember that Boeing is now heavily dependent on Japan not only for its most advanced components but for key production technologies. That this is evidence of American manufacturing weakness is clearly apparent when you realize that wages in Japan have long been considerably higher than in the United States. Using statistics from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, I calculate that at the current market exchange rate, wages in Japan are at least 30 percent higher than in the United States. This undoubtedly seems surprising in view of the way the Japanese economy has been reported since the bubble burst in 1990, but it is nonetheless a historically crucial fact.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/Manhattan Avenue Between 104th and 106th Streets;
1880's Brick Row Houses With a Bostonian Air

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
THE picturesque pocket of Victorian row houses on Manhattan Avenue from 104th to 106th Streets, which date from the time the thoroughfare got its name, has a calm Bostonian air that makes it seem a bit removed from city life.
Manhattan Avenue was not on the original street plan for New York City, but by 1868 it was mapped -- as New Avenue -- running north from 100th Street between what are now Central Park West and Columbus Avenue. This was well before any real development in the area, but in the mid-1880's sales activity picked up, and the thoroughfare received its current name in 1884. High land prices discouraged row house building on Central Park West, although in 1884 the New York Cancer Hospital -- now abandoned -- started its giant rounded building on Central Park West from 105th to 106th Streets. 
 The first building activity on Manhattan Avenue occurred in 1885, when Frederick Seitz put up the row houses on the west side of the street from 105th to 106th, designed by Joseph M. Dunn. The next year the developer John Brown built up the east side of the same block with houses designed by C. P. H. Gilbert, and in 1889 Joseph Turner had the architect Edward Angell design the houses on the west side of Manhattan Avenue from 104th to 105th.
Although other developers were still putting up traditional high-stoop brownstones elsewhere in Manhattan, all these buildings were brick, with stone and terra cotta trim and lower stoops; they were only three stories tall, costing between $8,000 and $12,000 to build. The houses designed by Gilbert, who later did Fifth Avenue mansions like what is now the original wing of the Jewish Museum at 92nd Street, are close to the Queen Anne style, with sunburst motifs in the gables, wavy linear ornament on the cornice, and multilight windows with stained glass.
Those by Dunn are a little wilder, with widely varying arches and gables. The critic Montgomery Schuyler coined the phrase "reign of terror" style to describe them because of their startling and alarming appearance. The Angell houses are neo-Romanesque and more sophisticated, although still quite varied. All have unusual ornament -- terra cotta panels with rivet-head figuring, sunburst ironwork and subtly varying brickwork.
The early occupants were modestly successful, like George B. Sharp, a stable owner, at 122 Manhattan Avenue; Albert H. Kohn, a jeweler, at 132; and Paris Fletcher, an electrician, at 138.
Sometime in the 1910's the family of Charles Gruppe moved into 138 Manhattan Avenue; a landscape painter, Gruppe lived there with his wife and three sons, Paul, a cellist, Karl, a sculptor, and Emile, a painter. At the same time more and more houses were renting out rooms -- George C. Hammer, a sea captain, was a roomer at 119 Manhattan Avenue.
By then, the houses on Manhattan Avenue were holdouts in a sea of tenements and apartment buildings, their status reinforced when the giant Frederick Douglass housing project went up at the southwest corner of 104th Street and Manhattan Avenue in the 1950's.
Daniel and Elsie Matos are among the senior residents of the row-house stretch of Manhattan Avenue -- they moved into the top floor of 122 Manhattan Avenue in 1959. "We were living on East 117th Street and came over here for something different," Mrs. Matos said. Mr. Matos, a retired cabdriver, said that "when we moved in this was a drug dealer's neighborhood."
His building has spongy linoleum-covered stairs, ancient paint and battered front doors, but it also has its original encaustic tile vestibule floor and original woodwork. He said that his monthly rent was between $200 and $300 and he estimated that the rent for each full-floor apartment in the building was about the same. "It's great -- you go to bed at night and you don't hear a fly in here," he said.
Ella S. McDonald bought the building at 138 Manhattan Avenue in 1972. She said that Karl Gruppe would not sell unless she and her husband promised not to convert the building into a rooming house. "I said, 'What's a rooming house?' and he let us buy it," she recalled. "The block was unbelievably bad. My family thought I had lost my mind -- a couple of houses were boarded up, street people all over the place, bongos 24 hours a day. But five or six of us families got together, and we decided we were not going to let the drug people push us out."
ELIZABETH KELLNER said that she and her husband, David, both lawyers, bought their house, at 132 Manhattan Avenue, in 1976 for $25,000. She said they stripped all the woodwork and installed period fixtures. The fireplaces on the lower floors are heavily worked oak pieces, with figured tiles in earth tones, but the top-floor fireplaces are plain slate, with geometric incised lines, spare and abstract.
Their living room -- perhaps 12 by 16 feet -- is small and cozy, but big enough for a baby grand, a small sofa and a large television. Like the other three-story Manhattan Avenue houses, theirs is much more livable than the standard dark Manhattan row house, usually built very deep and four or five stories high.
In December 1986 Mr. Kellner used an old statute, the Bawdy House Law, to evict squatting drug dealers who had taken over the building at 124 Manhattan Avenue. Since then, neighbors agree, the neighborhood has continued to improve. Mrs. Kellner said that although the available shopping is not what she would prefer, "I really like the fact that the neighborhood is racially, ethnically and economically integrated." They have taken down the board fences separating their backyard from their neighbors'.
All this has taken place in the shadow of the old New York Cancer Hospital, later a nursing home, designated a landmark in 1976 and vacant since. There have been various plans for redevelopment, but the building remains a majestic wreck. Some call it a blight, but it is also a peaceful interlude in the area, a sort of architectural preserve.
Mrs. McDonald said she likes it on Manhattan Avenue. "It's a neighborhood," she said. "When my brother came by to come in with a key, people asked him who he was -- my brother was very impressed. Why would I move from here?"

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Greenport, N.Y.;
A Working Seaport, Reliant on Visitors

BYLINE: By JOHN RATHER 

 BODY:
THERE can be few waterside views as nautically inspiring as those in the Village of Greenport, an authentic seaport on eastern Long Island that depends on tourism but stubbornly resists becoming a parody of itself.
Situated 95 miles east of Manhattan on the Peconic Bay side of the still rural North Fork, it is a deep-water port where fishing vessels back from the Hudson Canyon and Georges Banks tie up at piers near ferryboats shuttling between the village and nearby Shelter Island. 
 In recent years, Greenport has reversed a period of economic decline and stagnation that was odd for a place so well situated and steeped in history. Some attribute the turnaround to an energetic mayor, David E. Kapell, the village's third real estate broker-mayor.
Mr. Kapell, the owner of Kapell Real Estate and the son of the late concert pianist William Kapell, moved to Greenport from the Upper East Side of Manhattan in 1979 and raised a family here with his wife, Eileen. First elected in 1994, he said he sought the office in part to revive the village's lagging real estate market.
Now he worries that if housing prices rise too high the village will be too rich for the blue-collar families that are at its core. And he frets when new residents complain about the nocturnal noises of the fishing fleet and the smell of fish from the docks and two fish-processing plants.
"This is the type of thing we confront in Greenport, and it's what is going to determine whether we maintain our tradition or become just another charming has-been Victorian seaport," Mr. Kapell said. "We are going to resist change with every ounce of energy we've got if it means a loss of our identity, and if the fish smell keeps change at bay then we're all for it."
Although prices are rising, Greenport's predominantly 19th century and pre-World War II Victorian, colonial, Arts and Crafts and other homes, ranging from frankly humble to fantastical and from nondescript to nonpareil, are also among the most affordable on Long Island.
Three-bedroom, two-bath Victorians or colonials on small lots may still be found for comfortably less than $200,000. The highest recent home sale price, a record, was just under $900,000 for a waterfront Victorian on two acres. A one-bedroom bungalow on a corner lot three blocks from the water recently sold for $60,000.
Some of Greenport's finer homes are in West Dublin, named for the Irish railway workers who settled there after the Long Island Rail Road reached Greenport in 1844. Other sections include Stirling, the most venerable, and Easy Street, once the sailors' bordello and bar district.
The village has three condominiums, all with water views and built within the last 20 years. At the 35-unit Sterling Cove and 26-unit Oyster Point, two-bedroom apartments sell for about $250,000. At the nine-unit Pipes Cove, they go for $350,000 to $400,000.
House rentals, which are occasionally available, range from about $800 to $1,200 a month on a year-round basis.
Sally A. Heitel, a broker associate and manager at Century 21 Albertson Realty, formerly Victorian Realty, said the local real estate market was humming.
"It's hot, very hot," she said. "We've seen prices increase by probably 20 or 30 percent in the last year. Inventory is the problem."
Ms. Heitel moved to Greenport a year ago from Greenwich Village, drawn by Greenport's pedestrian scale and "creaky screen doors like you never hear in the city."
"I had always imagined coming out here and living somewhere really remote," she said. "And living in the village is about as remote as you can get."
REMOTE or not, the village is a favorite place for day-trippers, who on weekends crowd the narrow sidewalks along Front and Main Streets in the main commercial district.
Stores include the Book Scout, a used book and record emporium where discards share shelf space with semiprecious volumes; S. T. Preston and Sons, a maritime hardware store crammed with nautical supplies and just a few steps from the Main Street wharf; the Coronet, a time-warp 1950's era luncheonette; the Arcade, an old-fashioned general merchandise store that stocks everything from odd buttons to low-cost work clothes; several art galleries and restaurants.
Though it relies on visitors, Greenport also gladly ushers in newcomers provided they take the village on its own terms.
"Unlike a lot of other places on the North Fork, Greenport welcomes growth," said Joseph L. Townsend an insurance broker, former mayor, and descendant of some the village's earliest English settlers. "But we want to make it hard to buy a two-acre plot, and easy to buy a house that is already here and have it restored."
Mr. Townsend, like many others, said the village was on an upward track. "The atmosphere has become a lot more cosmopolitan," he said. "It's not quite as chichi as Sag Harbor, but it's getting there."
STILL, people looking for a nascent Hampton will turn on their heels in this place without pretense, whose rough past is recalled in a Front Street tavern called the Whiskey Wind, an allusion to rum-running during Prohibition.
"There's no snobbery here, people are themselves," said John A. Serkin, a piano technician, son of the late concert pianist Rudolf Serkin and brother of concert pianist Peter Serkin.
After years of visiting, John Serkin and his wife, Catherine Kurland, a decorative arts consultant and writer, moved to Greenport from Manhattan about eight years ago. "Once I tasted life out here I didn't ever want to go back to the city," Mr. Serkin said.
Mr. Serkin is now involved in a program to bring classical music to Greenport schools. With an architect friend, Gary Paul, he has designed a camera obscura for the waterfront Mitchell Park on Front Street, which will include an amphitheater, a skating rink, a public marina and a 1920's era carousel when it opens in two phases, beginning in April. The carousel is temporarily housed at the corner of Front Street and Third Street. Rides cost $1.
In another part of the village at the foot of Webb Street the Peconic County Miniature Railroad Company gives rides on 16-inch gauge tracks running through the woods. Rides are free but donations are accepted.
At the Polo Grounds, another village park, a new skateboarding center charges $3 for a three-hour session. There are also ballfields and a traveling carnival visits in the summer. The park is near Moore's Woods, a 190-acre village-owned woodland, and the privately owned, April-to-October Eastern Long Island Kamp Grounds just outside the village boundary.
There is a small public beach at the foot of Sixth Street. In addition to several private marinas, there are 43 moorings at $600 a season each available to village residents.
The village has its own electric utility, which has kept electric rates low.
TRAIN service is limited and the only weekday commuter train takes nearly three hours, with changes at Ronkonkoma and Jamaica, to reach Pennsylvania Station. Sunrise Coach buses are quicker and discharge passengers in midtown.
The 625-student Greenport public schools have all the advantages and disadvantages of a small district. All classes, from kindergarten through high school, are held in a single building erected in 1932 as a Depression-era public works project.
Dr. Charles Kozora, the superintendent, said teachers and students get to know each other well. "We never have anybody fall through the cracks," he said. But he said there were fewer electives than in larger districts.
Among the 33 graduates in the class of 1999, more than half earned Regents diplomas and 84 percent went on to higher education. Average College Board scores were 529 in verbal and 513 in math, compared with state averages of 495 and 502, respectively. The class had the highest passing rate in Suffolk County for the English Regents exam.
In a cooperative program with the Southampton Campus of Long Island University, academically qualified juniors and seniors may take accelerated courses in advanced chemistry and calculus. Advanced placement courses are also offered.
All classes are academically heterogeneous. Special education students attend regular classes, but get extra help from teachers assigned to them. Computer-assisted lessons begin in kindergarten. Students have access to computers in the library and in a computer lab.
The Youngs family, descendants of Puritans who arrived on the North Fork in 1640, bought land and settled in what is now Greenport in 1682. From the late 18th century to the mid-1800's, Greenport prospered as a fishing and whaling center.
Known in earlier times as Winter Harbor and Stirling, the village adopted the name Greenport when it incorporated in 1838. When the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line arrived in 1844, a rail-and-steamboat link was forged between New York City and Boston. Demand for the service waned after the two cities were joined by overland rails not long afterward.
In an event that brought Greenport notoriety, village residents voted in 1994 to sack their police department for incompetence and worse, saving $1 million a year in taxes. The village is now patrolled by the Southold Town police department.

TRAIN BANE: Greenport's romance with the railroad soured last year when new diesel locomotives went into service with whistles so loud and shrill they wake people from their sleep. Most notorious of all is an early morning train that lumbers eastward across the North Fork between 4 and 5 a.m. and departs from Greenport at 5:30 a.m. with a handful of passengers. "The whistle is causing a lot of problems," said Joseph L. Townsend, the former Greenport mayor. "People hate it." Now, responding to complaints from residents and public officials from areas of Long Island where the new diesels are in service, the railroad has agreed to tone the whistles down and make them more melodious.

High-Tech Growth Filling Financial District Offices

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
JOSEPH MOINIAN stood at the corner of John and Gold Streets recently and recalled what it was like in this downtown office district in the middle of the decade. "Eighty John Street was fully vacant, 90 John Street was 68 percent vacant, 99 John Street was about to become fully vacant and 90 William Street was 60 percent vacant," he said. "It was a ghost town." 
 The area had been badly hit by the decline of employment in the financial services and insurance industries and the departures of some of the more prominent companies to new buildings in Midtown.
 The overall downtown vacancy rate was more than 30 percent and some real estate executives said some of the older buildings were too obsolete to ever be used for offices again.
Nevertheless, Mr. Moinian, the chief executive of the Moinian Group, a developer, saw opportunities in the area. He was convinced that the growth of a new industry -- computer related software and services -- along with a city development plan that provided rent and energy tax benefits and a promotion sponsored by the Alliance for Downtown New York would draw tenants to the area.
So in 1995 he bought the 29-story building at 90 John Street. The following year he purchased another building a block away at 90 William Street and began rewiring both so they would be ready for the high tech tenants he hoped to attract. The wiring included optical fiber telecommunications backbones and upgraded electrical service to power the devices the new companies would use.
Today both buildings are fully rented to tenants like Gobi Inc., which gives computers to people who sign up for its services, and Spendcash, which enables users to buy things over the Internet without disclosing credit information. Both buildings have waiting lists of tenants who want to move into an area that has been dubbed Silicon Alley because of the concentration of computer-based companies.
The growth of this industry, much more than the expansion of downtown's traditional mainstay of financial services, has pushed down the area's office vacancy rate to 9.2 percent as of the end of the third quarter, according to a report by Cushman & Wakefield, a real estate services company.
Employment in the media and entertainment sector, much of it computer-based, has increased by 25,138 jobs over the last five years, according to an analysis of New York State Department of Labor data by Colliers ABR, a real estate services company. Meanwhile the financial, insurance and real estate category only increased by 9,856 jobs, indicating the decrease in relative importance of the financial sector for office space demand.
As a result, the Moinian buildings are no longer participants in the Plug 'n' Go program sponsored by the Alliance for Downtown New York, the business improvement district for the southern tip of Manhattan. The program offers below market initial rents and other incentives to lure companies to a part of town that once seemed a backwater.
To participate in the program, the owner of a building has to build out and wire at least 20,000 square feet of space and offer it to the market at a rental rate that started at $15 a foot in 1996 and has increased to $19 a foot in the current program. The rates, which increase in later years of a lease, have been 20 to 30 percent below market rates.
Six buildings have participated in each of the three years the Plug 'n' Go program has been in effect, for a total of 14 so far, according to Sharon Greenberger, vice president for economic development at the alliance. "There have been 225 leases signed under the program, covering 570,000 square feet," Ms. Greenberger said.
LOW rental rates were the initial lure, Ms. Greenberger said, but since then the concentration of technology-based companies has become a lure for others in similar fields. "We have over 700 high-technology companies here in what has become a marquee location," she said. "It is the rebirth of the area as a technology community."
She said the alliance matches the city's contribution of $100,000 a year to promote the Plug 'n' Go program. The city's incentives for new tenants, part of a broader effort to revive the downtown area, include a reduction in the rent tax that real estate executives say amounts to about $1 per square foot and discounts on electrical power.
Mr. Moinian said he decided to buy the buildings and participate in the Plug 'n' Go program because the high vacancy rates at the time meant there was probably more to gain than lose. "My philosophy at the time was that it made sense to rent for $15 a square foot. The downside was that somebody would rent for $15 a foot and go out of business. But the upside was that somebody would go from 2,500 square feet to 25,000 square feet."
While there have been a few failures, he said, most of the companies have survived and expanded. He said the program had attracted more than 60 technology companies to the buildings, one of which, 90 William Street, has been renamed One Silicon Alley Plaza to emphasize its orientation.
Mr. Moinian said the often frenetic operating style of the technology companies had changed the way the buildings are managed. Cutting back services during the evenings and weekends is not acceptable to them. "These guys have deadlines they have to meet," he said. "They have to have 7/24 access," he said, using the shorthand term for 24 hour a day, 7 day a week operations.
Another departure from traditional management practice was the installation of a 20,000 square foot gym at 90 John Street to provide a recreational outlet for the most young employees of the companies.
Renovations to the buildings included some standard upgrades such as sprucing up the lobbies, replacing leaky old windows and improving the heating and air-conditioning. But the new wiring and telecommunications were the critical attractions.
"We had to bring fiber to the buildings, because it was not there," Mr. Moinian said. "It's a revolution, like the addition of air conditioning to buildings. In a few years, I don't think you will be able to rent a building without fiber, just like you couldn't rent a building without air-conditioning."
He said brokers would point out the pre-installed connections in the wall to prospective high-technology tenants. "If they knew technology, they knew exactly what those plugs were for," Mr. Moinian said.
The vacant space in the buildings was built out in units of 1,000 to 10,000 square feet. These relatively modest spaces have become something of a problem as fast-growing companies have hired more people than they have the space to accommodate.
"Some of these companies have people sitting in their kitchens," said William G. Cohen, an executive vice president of Newmark & Company Real Estate, a real estate services firm that represents the Moinian Group.
He said landlords try to retain growing tenants by finding them other areas in their buildings that have more space. But even if they are forced to leave, it is not a total loss. "That allows us to rent the space at higher rates," said Mr. Cohen, who added that current rates started at $27 a foot."
He said many of these start-up companies would prefer to be in trendier part of the city, such as SoHo or Midtown South, but did not want to face higher rental rates and unfinished space at a time when they really want to plug in and get going. "They come downtown and find the space all prewired and ready to do business," Mr. Cohen said. "And then they discover that wherever their employees are coming from -- Brooklyn, Queens, New Jersey or Manhattan -- it is a really easy location to get to."
Mr. Moinian said he was convinced that advanced wiring and telecommunications were attractions for all categories of real estate. "I've got the building at 17 Battery that's being converted to 500 apartments," he said. "And I'm going to put the infrastructure into those apartments."

HEADLINE: Q & A;
Providing Heat in an Apartment

 BODY:

Q I live in a small rent-controlled apartment. Its only sources of heat are a small radiator and two vertical steam pipes, one in the kitchen and the other in the bathroom. The riser in the bathroom is equipped with a steam valve near the ceiling that noisily spews dirty, rusty water and a foul-smelling gas that floods the bathroom and makes me sick. Management's response to my complaints have been to change the valve -- which produces no result -- or to remove it -- which deprives me of heat. Am I not entitled to enough heat, including in the bathroom, and to clean healthy air? . . . Anne-Marie Kunzler, Manhattan.
 
A Sandy Russo, housing law coordinator for Legal Services for New York City, said that every residential lease agreement in New York carries with it an implied warranty that the premises are suitable for human habitation. 
 "The failure to provide adequate heat throughout the apartment, failure to correct noxious odors, unreasonable noise and flooding all constitute a breach of the warranty of habitability," Ms. Russo said.
She added that the New York City Housing Maintenance Code requires that between Oct. 1 and May 31, a landlord must provide sufficient heat to maintain apartments at 68 degrees Fahrenheit between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. when the outside temperature falls below 55.
Between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m., she said, heat must be maintained at 55 degrees when the outside temperature falls below 40 degrees. And while it is not uncommon for a steam pipe riser to be the source of heat for a small room such as a bathroom or kitchen, Ms. Russo said, the landlord is nevertheless required by law to provide the minimum heat required by law throughout the apartment.
She said that if a landlord violates the heat law, or otherwise breaches the warranty of habitability, a tenant has several options. For example, Ms. Russo said, a tenant can withhold the rent to compel the landlord to correct the problem. If the landlord begins nonpayment proceedings in housing court, she said, the tenant can assert the landlord's breach of the warranty of habitability as a defense and can demand a rent abatement for the period during which the condition existed.
In addition, Ms. Russo said, if a landlord fails, after reasonable notice, to correct a serious condition affecting habitability, a tenant may perform the necessary work and deduct the cost from the rent owed.
In New York City, she said, a tenant can also bring a case against a landlord in housing court seeking a court order for the landlord to correct the violations. And finally, Ms. Russo said, rent-regulated tenants can apply for a rent reduction order from the Division of Housing and Community Renewal when the landlord has failed to provide services or maintain the premises as required by law.
Tenants with complaints about insufficient heat in their apartments can also call the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development's heat hot line: (212) 960-4800.
 
An Apartment Without a Stove
 
Q I have a friend who lives in an apartment in the West 30's that I believe is rent-controlled. He has been there for more than 15 years and has had no stove for the entire time. Is the landlord required to provide a stove? . . . Jennifer Williams Ketay, Manhattan.
 
A Jeffrey Ween, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that both the New York City Housing Maintenance Code and the state's Multiple Dwelling Law require a landlord to provide gas or electricity for cooking facilities, but neither requires the landlord to provide the appliances themselves.
Mr. Ween added, however, that under both rent control and rent stabilization, any services provided by a landlord at the time an apartment became subject to regulation must be maintained even if there is a change in occupancy. Accordingly, he said, if there was a stove in the friend's apartment at the time the apartment became subject to regulation, the friend is entitled to a stove now, even if he accepted the apartment without one.
Mr. Ween said that since information regarding the services provided in specific rent-regulated apartments is kept on file with the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the friend should contact the division to determine what is on file for the apartment.

'Souvenirs: Collecting, Memory
And Material Culture'
Guild Hall Museum, 158 Main Street, East Hampton. Through Jan. 9. (631) 324-0806.
Exerting a wide reach that jogs the mind in a rewarding way, this large exhibition mixes contemporary art with art and artifacts that have a clear place in Long Island's history. It demonstrates that current pieces, too, can be repositories of memory, longing and nostalgia. There are vintage souvenir plates, scrapbooks, old maps, matchbooks and calendars, along with paintings, photographs and sculpture by a number of 19th- and 20th-century artists. 
 Determining an order, or pattern, for any collection is standard procedure. In the hands of artists, the configurations can have tremendous visual energy, and one of the exhibition's strengths is its focus on the arrangements imposed on various accumulations of things. High-impact examples include Donald Lip ski's wheel of trophies, Michelle Stuart's table of seed specimens and Matt Mullican's collage of matchbooks.
The scheme can also involve the artist's concept for collecting data. Billy Sullivan's bird drawings, for example, record sightings during a specific span of minutes on specific days.
Landscape themes have an important role throughout the exhibition, and there is an emphasis on the way attitudes toward subject matter can differ and adjust, causing meanings to shift. Special attention is given to the process of committing a favorite site to memory. The abstract black-and-gray structured surface of Clifford Ross's photograph "Jetty II," the uncanny, oddly illuminated photographs by Susan Wides and the blurred, fractured paintings by Darragh Park are good examples. So are Howard Clifford's blend of diaristic entries and sensuous abstract paintings that capture direct experiences.
Two large, particularly successful recent works comment on the environment. They are linked to both the show's configuration theme and its feeling for souvenirs of a chosen place. In "Waters of East Hampton," Stacy Levy has covered a map of the township with 60 etched-glass containers, each holding a liquid sample from a different site. Hope Sandrow's sprawling but rationally organized installation has a title that corresponds to her process-oriented approach: "Within a Golden Rectangle: Moon Snail shells, numbering almost 10,000. Found November 12, 1997, washing up on the beach near the Mecox Bay Inlet to the Atlantic Ocean."
 
Loren Madsen: '6 Billion Monkeys'
Art Gallery, State University at Stony Brook. Through Dec. 11. (631) 632-7240.
In recent years, sculpture projects inspired by socio-economic and historical statistics have become central for the Manhattan-based artist Loren Madsen, whose three-decade career has included a number of dramatic works that thrust through space in their museum, gallery and public settings. His new piece, having its inaugural showing in Stony Brook, combines weighty population figures with a bit of whimsical humor.
Mr. Madsen has devised a visually engaging, multipart probability machine to test the old aphorism that, given 1,000 years, 1,000 monkeys sitting at typewriters will eventually produce a "Hamlet." An announcement that the world's population would reach six billion this fall was behind his numerical adjustment to the literary proposition.
The installation's largest unit, a dazzling, suspended 20-foot gilded circular form at the end of a 60-foot stem, represents the mushrooming count of humans on the planet. Smaller, quite different components include a ticking clockwork apparatus that regularly releases and alphabet marbles and sends them through the channels of a troughlike construction. These random letters occasionally create words.
There are moments when the piece projects a decided playfulness, but other moments when the sensuousness of the subtle, illusive metallic tones, reflections and shadows surrounding the main sculpture makes the effect quite powerful and beautiful. The work's resonance feels right for its statistical message. An appropriate parallel occurs, too, in the way the constant click of the clock's gears symbolizes counting, the passage of time and further growth in the world's population.
 
'Measurement'
Amelie Wallace Gallery, State University at Old Westbury. Through Dec. 4. (516) 876-3148.
Snappy and engaging, this provocative though small exhibition looks at various ways artists have used ideas about measurement. Its five examples generally lean toward a conceptual orientation and date from 1968 to 1979. All use commonplace elements and, in doing so, also raise issues about art's relationship to everyday life.
Viewers quickly feel part of the spatial situation established by Mel Bochner's "Measurement: Wall," a horizontal black tape and numerical reading (36 feet in this installation of the variable-size piece) that spans the central point on one gallery wall, turning its definition of space and dimension into the subject.
Projects by Vito Acconci and Mierle Laderman Ukeles are experienced, in part, through photodocumentation. Mr. Acconci's sequence traces his endurance scores over a period of months as he tested his ability to climb a step stool rapidly. Ms. Ukeles's measurements of labor activities, like trash collecting and sweeping, uses the photographic record she made in her rather well-known study of maintenance-as-art. In both instances the artist's investigation started with a specific format, which provided shape for the finished piece.
On Kawara's measurement-sequence pieces, usually works on paper, are considered to be classics of Conceptual Art. The example here is taken from a series of postcards mailed to friends during a 10-year period. Each notes the time the artist awoke on a specific day.
In a particularly memorable work, Mimi Smith uses tape measures to draw the outlines of bureaus and a bed. The transitory nature of her soft fabric lines and the airy spaces they describe contradict conventional notions of the bulky scale of household furniture with great effect.

HEADLINE: In the Region/New Jersey;
Energy-Efficient, Ecology-Sensitive Housing

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

 BODY:
THE 128-apartment development in Newark -- involving both the conversion of a 19th century factory into 62 units and the construction of a 66-unit apartment building on the nearby site of a factory that is to be demolished -- appears to be much like other low- and moderate-income rental housing projects in New Jersey.
But the two buildings are being designed to be environmentally sensitive, energy efficient and more affordable for residents to maintain, thanks to a $17 million state pilot program. 
 The two-building project is one of eight that the state's Department of Community Affairs is financing under its Sustainable Development/Affordable Housing Program, which was initiated last year. Among the others are projects involving the construction and restoration of one- and two-family houses in a historic area of Trenton and the development of 100 rentals on a patch of farmland in Eastampton, in Burlington County. The eight projects will produce 424 new and renovated rental and for-sale units for people earning 50 to 80 percent of their area's median income.
Under the program, which state officials say is the first of its kind in the nation, $12 million in low-interest loans of up to $55,500 a unit is available to developers to offset the cost of designing housing with higher energy efficiency and lower impact on the environment. In addition, $5 million in below-market-rate mortgages will be offered to income-qualified buyers by the New Jersey Housing Mortgage Finance Agency.
The aim is to encourage developers to build housing "that will be low-cost to people and low-cost to the environment," said Jane M. Kenny, commissioner of the Department of the Department of Community Affairs, which oversees housing issues. It is, she said, "a radical approach and the first step in what will raise the bar for and be a trend in affordable housing production."
While the idea of developing so-called "green" buildings, is not new, combining it with low- and moderate-cost housing, known as affordable housing, has been slow to take hold. A key reason, industry professionals say, is the cost to incorporate energy-efficient and environmentally sensitive features into housing that relies heavily on public financing. Another difficulty is that "developers are entrenched in doing business as usual and often need an incentive to try something different, which is what New Jersey's program provides," said Joseph W. Lstibureck, a principal of Building Science Corporation, an engineering and architectural firm in Westford, Mass. His company works with developers to change their construction techniques to reduce costs and warranty claims.
The pilot program will show developers that "while they may spend more on the shell of the house, they will save on its mechanical system, making their investment a wash," Mr. Lstibureck said. The new technologies will initially cost more, but as they become more widely used costs will drop, he added.
Commissioner Kenny said that affordable homes built with energy-saving features, such as added insulation or extra-efficient equipment, will cost less for residents to maintain. The homes built under the program are expected to reduce a residential utility bill by at least $378 a year for a typical three-bedroom home, she said.
To participate in the program, a developer's homes must meet or exceed standards established by Public Service Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, which also reflect federal standards. The standards call for them to be at least 30 percent more energy efficient than a typical house constructed or renovated in the state. The utility, which is a partner in the program, will also pay the developer $1,500, plus 42 cents per square foot for each home that meets its standards. For example, for a 2,200-square-foot house a developer would get $2,424.
In addition, the state's Board of Public Utilities will provide additional financial incentives to developers who use solar heating techniques, such as solar panels and photovoltaic cells to convert sunlight into electricity, in their projects. Commissioner Kenny said there was a pool of $200,000 available to developers to design and implement such features.
The program encourages developers to try to limit a project's impact on the environment by, among other things, using building materials that contain recycled contents, are durable, have reduced toxicity and help improve indoor air quality. They are also encouraged to preserve trees and to develop the housing near shopping and mass transit links.
DEVELOPERS say they got involved in the program to stay abreast of new technologies and ahead of the competition. They add that they probably would not have incorporated the technologies into their projects without the state subsidies
Commissioner Kenny said the program "will enable us to identify which strategies work and can be replicated." To ensure that the production of such housing continues, she said, her department will begin as early as this spring to require developers to incorporate the successful strategies into their projects as part of the competition for state funding.
The $15 million two-building development under way in Newark is being developed by RPM Development Corporation of Montclair, using mostly public funds, including $900,000 it received under the new state program. That money is being used to incorporate into both buildings -- the renovated factory on North 13th Street, between Park and Sixth Avenues and the new structure on Park Avenue at North 11th Street, a couple of blocks away -- such features as energy-efficient fluorescent lighting and fiberglass, instead of vinyl, window frames, which are considered better for the environment. In addition, the buildings will have cellulose insulation, which is made from recycled newspapers and blown into walls, filling air cavities more tightly and conserving energy more efficiently.
Bricks salvaged from the factory that is to be demolished will also be recycled and used for walkways as well as to repoint the facade of the building being renovated. And at each building, storm water will be collected and used to irrigate lawns and plants.
"Meeting the energy efficiency standards will make for better buildings, and in the long term will probably save us from going back to fix things 10 to 15 years from now," said Edward Martoglio, a principal at RPM. Mr. Martoglio said the program also "encourages more thoughtful ways to fit projects into the neighborhood."
The 128 units will have one to three bedrooms, with 650 to 1,100 square feet. Rents will range from $480 for a one-bedroom unit to $630 for a three-bedroom.
In Trenton, $1 million from the pilot program will be combined with $3 million in other, mostly public subsidies to develop Clinton Park Townhouses, comprising 23 new and renovated one- and two-family for-sale houses, with a rental apartment in each of the two-family houses They will rise along Ewing and Southard Streets in the city's Ewing-Carroll historic district. Construction is to start this spring, with completion to follow a year later.
"The program forces you to use products and designs you would not normally use because affordable housing projects are built on such tight budgets you don't want to stray too far from what is known to work," said Christiana Foglio, a principal of Home Properties of New Brunswick, the developer.
The homes will have such features as energy efficient mechanical systems, additional insulation, and air handling systems that increase indoor air quality. The front and rear yards also will be landscaped with plantings that absorb storm water runoff and the homes will laid out to have a southern exposure to the sun, maximizing passive solar energy, Ms. Foglio said.
The one-family homes will have 1,011 square feet of space; the two-family homes will have an owner's unit, with 969 to 1,051 square feet plus a rental apartment with 562 to 637 square feet. The sale price is expected to be $85,000 and the apartments are to rent for $500 to $550 a month.
In Eastampton, Pennrose Properties of Philadelphia will use $1.3 million from the program to build a 100-unit low-rise rental development. It will be built on 25 acres of a 300-acre site just off the intersection of Woodlane and Monmouth Roads. The remaining 275 acres, which contain wetlands, will be left undeveloped.
THE project will have a road system that encourages walking and the units will be grouped in clusters of four instead of eight as originally planned, providing additional open space. They also will be arranged on the site to take advantage of sun and shade, and will be built with better insulated foundations and stack framing, which requires less lumber, said Charles M. Lewis, a vice president at Pennrose.
Most of the two- and three-bedroom rentals will be town-house-style apartments with 990 to 1,150 square feet; some will be condominium flats with 910 to 1090 square feet. Rents are expected to be $517 to $596 a month. Construction of the $13 million project is scheduled to begin in the spring and take a year to complete.
Pennrose is also involved with a project in Camden, where it will receive $800,000 to rehabilitate an apartment building and an adjacent three-building garden-style rental complex, both abandoned historic landmarks, into 51 apartments for low-income elderly residents.
"When you talk about affordable, it is not only what it costs to build but what it costs residents to maintain, which could make an affordable house unaffordable," Mr. Lewis said. "If nothing else, the state program forces you to think about these issues."

HEADLINE: Overcoming the Obstacles in One's Career

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER 

 BODY:
TWENTY years ago when Faye Woocher began her practice as a career counselor she was frequently mistaken for someone who worked in a high school. And she found that women were primarily looking for advice on how to get into the job market.
But now, with women making up 46 percent of the country's labor force and with 49 percent of them in managerial and professional positions, the picture is vastly different. Or is it? 
 Sherri Lamoreaux is not so sure. Ms. Lamoreaux. who is a client of Ms. Woocher's, spent 11 years as a trader on the investment side of the business for three different hedge funds.
"I left Wall Street two years ago, suffering from burnout and a situation at work that was not congenial," she said. "So I changed direction completely and opened a store, Sorelle, a high-end boutique in Armonk. I started it from scratch and funded it completely myself."
Although her store has done very well, Ms. Lamoreaux said, she wants to go back to Wall Street.
"Quite frankly, the store has been fun," she said, "but doing essentially the same thing every day is no challenge for me. I felt removed from the world."
And so Ms. Lamoreaux contacted Ms. Woocher. "I needed someone to help me realistically assess my skills and potential," she said. "I had a professor at college who told us in business we should be able to 'function in disaster, finish in style.' I wanted to have the ability to do that."
Ms. Woocher, Ms. Lamoreaux said, helped her identify the obstacles in her way. "They were distasteful so I never really dealt with them before," she said, "but Faye is a remarkable counselor who has the ability to look and listen before she analyzed my problems and suggested strategies to help me navigate successfully on Wall Street."
Two things Ms. Woocher tells her clients to do is choose the company and the job very carefully.
"Understanding the company culture is very important," Ms. Woocher said. She described the plight of a client who was recruited for a job as chief financial officer at a manufacturing company.
"She was offered a very high salary plus bonuses and charged with not only upgrading the computer operations but with reorganization of the company, which meant a lot of downsizing," Ms. Woocher said. "She successfully completed everything asked of her, yet after two years she was fired. Why? Because she made enemies along the way."
Ms. Woocher, who has her office in Tarrytown, advises her clients to find a mentor she can rely on within the company. "My job as a counselor is to listen and ask questions in order to give clients a clearer sense of self and strengths, then they make decisions on their own," she said.
And in an era of low unemployment and few good employees, increasing numbers of corporations are seeking Ms. Woocher's services. "Companies that make a big investment in training employees want to retain them," she said.
One such employee, a valued employee, had good ideas but lacked assertiveness, she said. Another was reluctant to take a risky and challenging assignment.
"Career counseling is the most benign retention tool a company can use," Ms. Woocher said. "It has become the helper of choice in the workplace."
Gloria Goldstein, who teaches career counseling at Manhattan College in the Bronx, agreed. She also has a private practice in Larchmont. She said: "Women, much the same as men, recognize that long-term employment with one company is not a fact of life today. I encourage my clients to identify their skills, put together a skills portfolio, which can be transferred from job to job."
Ms. Goldstein said she believed assertiveness was more difficult for women than for men. "Many women tend to be meek and grateful for the job," she said. "Even young women lack a sense of upward mobility." She recalled a 27-year-old client, an underwriter, who was in a male-dominated business.
"She had a mentor, a relative who saw her ability to excel in math and encouraged her, but she has been in the same job for five years and should be moving on. She is learning how to be assertive and how to network, something she never did before."
Ms. Goldstein said: "Most of us also do outplacement work. People are working longer today, and many want or need second careers to get by. And my clients are older than they once were, ranging from 40 to 55."
Certified career counselors charge anywhere from $75 to $125 an hour, said Ms. Goldstein, adding that in her practice she sees equal numbers of men and women. To receive certification as a career counselor, in addition to a master's degree in counseling and two and a half years of job experience, applicants must pass a four-hour exam given by the National Board for Certified Counselors, based in Greensboro, N.C., Ms. Goldstein said.
Certification by the National Board began in 1984. Since then, about 800 career counselors nationwide, have been certified.
But that number is unlikely to grow, Ms. Goldstein said. The board stopped giving the exam this year because not enough people were taking it, she said, adding that as the number of people who may call themselves career counselors has increased for the consumer, it has become a case of buyer beware.
To find a certified career counselor, she suggests that consumers log on to the National Certified Counselors Web site, www.nbcc.org.
There are about 800 certified counselors nationwide, she said.
Both Ms. Woocher and Ms. Goldstein are members of the Westchester Career Counselors Network, an organization founded by Ms. Woocher in 1986, which draws 150 participants who pool their experiences and attend educational programs.
"We have speakers who tackle topics that aid us in our work," Ms. Woocher said. "They discuss such subjects as using the Internet in job searches, strategies that work and legal questions. We leave with practical hands-on tools and advice for assisting women clients to understand and navigate the corporate landscape."
To maintain certification, counselors must take 100 hours of continuing education every five years, which the Westchester Career Counselors Network provides, Ms. Woocher said.
Progress continues, she said, adding that a recent survey by Catalyst showed that in 1998 the top eight most profitable Fortune 500 companies had two or more female directors. "General Motors, the No. 1 ranked company, has three," she said.

HEADLINE: FILM;
From Russia, With Dark Humor, Like the Old Days

BYLINE: By NANCY RAMSEY; Nancy Ramsey's most recent article for Arts & Leisure was about Srdjan Dragojevic, director of "The Wounds."

 BODY:
AT last year's New York Film Festival, the director Aleksei Guerman, a bear of a man with a disarming wit and a typically Russian sense of irony, introduced his latest work, "Khroustaliov, My Car!" to the press. It was the first time in his 40-year career, he said, that he had completed a film that had not been immediately shelved by the authorities. His previous work, "My Friend Ivan Lapshin," spent four years in limbo before its release in 1985, when it became a celebrated film of the perestroika era. "After every film I made, I was fired from my job," he said.
"Khroustaliov, My Car!" which on Friday opens FilmFest, a series of recent films from Russia and the former Soviet republics at the Museum of Modern Art, is set in 1953, during the last days of Stalin's reign of terror. It was a time when it was not clear from one minute to the next who would fall out of favor, often with deadly consequences. 
 Shot in black and white and centering on an army brain surgeon who swills cognac and lusts after women with equal fervor, the film boldly addresses the paranoia, anti-Semitism and sheer lunacy of the times. Resembling an oversize Hieronymus Bosch painting, the film offers at least one scene that isn't for the faint of heart.
For Mr. Guerman, it's a film that he felt he had to make. He recently turned 60, and, he said at the press conference, "it was time to tally the score."
"The words are expressed by the grandmother in my film, 'I know so much; what a shame this is all going to vanish with me!' "
Mr. Guerman began "Khroustaliov" before the collapse of the Soviet Union. French financing of the film was subject to the fall of the ruble, and production sometimes shut down for up to a year. Yet he persevered. "So you realize," he said wryly, "how foolish I am."
Foolish, perhaps, but not atypical for a Russian director. Filmmaking in the Soviet Union was a serious matter. Shortly after the Revolution, Lenin reportedly declared, "Of all the arts, the most important to us is the cinema." What evolved over the next 70 years was an industry that not only glorified sailors, workers and young women falling blissfully in love with both tractors and heroes of the Revolution, but also, after Stalin's death, a parallel aesthetic, one based on irony, satire, humor, metaphor and surrealism. Working within the state-run film industry, writers and directors created a sort of "kitchen democracy," presenting the humor and pathos of everyday life in a way that would pass the censors.
"A whole generation developed this secret language," said Sergei Solovyev, the director and former head of the Russian filmmakers union, at the Moscow International Film Festival in 1997. "But along with the social system, the aesthetic system collapsed. Now you can go to Red Square and shout whatever you want."
Artfulness often took a back seat to freedom of expression as films began to criticize the Soviet system. Chernukha, or blackness, became the rage during perestroika. The death of the regime brought mobster shoot-'em-ups and deliriously self-indulgent meditations on the Russian soul. But gradually filmmakers are returning to the irony, humor and subtle pathos that had endeared Soviet films to their audiences. Many of the better films that will be shown at the Modern (and at another festival of more than a dozen Russian films that runs Dec. 10-12 at both the Directors Guild Theater and the Anthology Film Archives in Manhattan) are, if not documentaries, then at least documentary-style. It is not only a wise stylistic choice but also a sound economic one in an industry sorely lacking money.
One such film, Larissa Sadilova's fictional "Happy Birthday," was shot cinema verite style on a low budget ($70,000, according to the director) in a provincial maternity hospital. Praised by Russian critics, the film is warm, sometimes humorous, but not sentimental. "In Russian literature, medical institutions are often metaphors for the state," said Susan Larsen, who teaches Russian literature and film at the University of California at San Diego. "They are places that are supposed to be about nurture but often aren't. 'Happy Birthday' has the gritty quality of chernukha films, but it's not rubbing your nose in the despair."
As if picking up where Ms. Sadilova left off, Viktor Kossakovsky's "Wednesday" tracks down people born on his birth date, July 19, 1961, in Leningrad. The camera takes us over the rooftops of what is now St. Petersburg and down into its apartments. A pregnant woman phones hospitals searching for an empty bed; a new Russian describes his plans for converting a Soviet naval vessel into a luxury yacht.
In "Pavel and Lyalya," the first in a trilogy about love and devoted to Pushkin, Mr. Kossakovsky visits a former teacher and his wife, an emigre couple in Jerusalem, for a warm and respectful look at their life.
Taking a less tender approach to the lives of the elderly is "Bread Day" by Sergei Dvortsevoy; his style is to let life unfold before his camera. In a remote, snowy village, pensioners meet the train for the weekly delivery of bread. Recriminations ensue, with the characters revealing more than they had intended.
In "An Ordinary President," the President of Belarus, Aleksandr Lukaschenko, shows himself in a bad light once footage of him is spliced into this piercing satirical documentary by Yuri Khashchevatsky. The film opens with a parable: When God granted the Belarussians their land, no one could believe how beautiful it was. But God frowned and said, "So that life shouldn't seem a paradise to you, you will always have the worst bosses."
Although "President" was officially banned in Belarus, some 150,000 bootleg videos have reportedly been distributed. It has been shown abroad too, with dire consequences for the filmmaker; in late 1997, after "An Ordinary President" was shown on French television, two men broke into Mr. Khashchevatsky's studio, beat him and stole only his scripts.
POLITICS are also engaged in Aleksandr Rogozhkin's fictional "Checkpoint," featuring a platoon of Russian soldiers stationed on a border in the Caucuses. "It is one of the first Russian films to tackle the problems of an ethnically splintered society," Ms. Larsen said.
Set in Tajikistan, "The Flight of the Bee," directed by Jamshed Usmonov and Min Biong Hun, is driven by a lyrical simplicity. When his rich neighbor builds a latrine next to his house, a schoolteacher sets out to right a wrong. "Central Asian films take their cues from oral traditions," said Jytte Jensen, FilmFest's curator. "A simple story turns into something poetic and beautiful about how you have to live with each other."
Earlier this month, Nikita Mikhalkov, the Academy Award-winning director of "Burnt by the Sun" (1994) and the current head of the Russian filmmakers' union, was in New York on a trip sponsored by a consultancy, Eurasia Group. (Mr. Mikhalkov's ambitions are not confined to films; he's reportedly toying with the idea of running for the presidency.) He recently completed "Barber of Siberia," a romanticized epic set during the reign of Czar Aleksandr III. His reason for returning to the past? "As a Russian poet once said, 'You can see something big at a distance,' " he answered. " 'When you're close you can't see it.' Cinema is not a gazette. In Russia, we have dramatic, serious problems.

HEADLINE: A Record of Despair Born of a Single Image

BYLINE: By GREIL MARCUS; Greil Marcus's most recent book is "Invisible Republic: Bob Dylan's Basement Tapes." This article is adapted from an essay that appeared in the 1999 Telluride Film Festival newsletter.

 BODY:
WHEN I first heard that someone had made a movie out of Michael Lesy's shocking, genre-defying "Wisconsin Death Trip," I couldn't imagine the result, or think of a book less amenable to film. It seemed absolutely a thing in itself: its own construct, its own nightmare, its own scream.
The film's director, James Marsh, of Arena, an adventurous division of the British Broadcasting Corporation, found Lesy's legendary 1973 title in a New York used-book store. "I made the book," Mr. Lesy says. "The book found James." 
 The mystical language is appropriate; the book can cast a spell. It is a progressively horrifying portrait of one small town, Black River Falls, Wis., crumbling -- socially, morally, psychologically, physically -- under the impact of the great depression of the 1890's. The words "great depression" do not take capitals here, as with the Great Depression of the 1930's; unlike that calamity, the depression of a century ago did not enter American folklore.
This collapse of the American economy was denied even as it happened: the 1893 Columbian Exposition, in Chicago, which introduced the Ferris wheel to the United States, was the denial as theme park. The depression hit farm states the hardest. There, where the weather had been understood as the greatest threat to an orderly life, all other foundations of predictability -- the assumption that in domestic and working life one day would be much like the one before it -- were destroyed.
The films Mr. Marsh made before "Wisconsin Death Trip" are imaginative, playful and well-defined; they hardly seem preparation for anything so dark and potentially borderless and out of control as his latest, which opens at the Film Forum in Manhattan on Wednesday.
Mr. Marsh received his first directorial assignment in 1989, when he was 25. Arena, says Mr. Marsh -- an Englishman now living in New York -- was putting on "themed evenings, four or five hours a night on a single subject." One was "Food night," and for it Mr. Marsh conceived a 15-minute segment on the last meals of condemned prisoners. "I wanted to know what the ritual meant in a bureaucratic system of execution," he says, recalling that in the British tradition a prisoner's last meal might also have involved a last drunk, complete with prostitutes. Because capital punishment had been all but abolished in the United Kingdom since the 1960's, Mr. Marsh set off for a two-day shoot on Death Row in Louisiana. "I wanted to expose the process in one detail," he says. He ended up focusing on a single prisoner, a man "outraged by the crazy idea of hospitality at the end of his life."
There is probably a more direct line from this first project to Mr. Marsh's "Wisconsin Death Trip" than to another food piece by him, "The Burger and the King." In this graceful account of "The Life and Cuisine of Elvis Presley," the fine David Adler book on which the film is based, cooks from throughout Presley's life -- from his high school cafeteria, the Army, Graceland -- present their dishes proudly and so lovingly that by the end one may want nothing more than to copy down the recipe for fried banana and peanut-butter sandwiches and make one.
"I became increasingly aware of the power of a single image, especially in photography: Diane Arbus, W. Eugene Smith," Mr. Marsh says when asked about the inspirations behind his films. That inspiration is most visible in Arena's revelatory 1993 series, "Story of a Song," Mr. Marsh's expansive accounts of Presley's "Heartbreak Hotel," Lou Reed's "Walk on the Wild Side," Buddy Holly's "Peggy Sue" and, especially, Bob Dylan's "Highway 61 Revisited." There Mr. Marsh offered not so much a story of a song as its biography -- as if it were a person, with ancestors and descendants. Watching the film, you can follow U.S. Highway 61 from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico as the Dylan song carries with it not only Highway 61 blues numbers but also the death of Bessie Smith, on Highway 61; Presley's childhood years in public housing, on Highway 61, and the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on Highway 61.
The single image that seals the film, though, is a a dramatization of a young Bob Dylan leaving Minnesota for New York City in 1961. Running through the shot is an early, hesitant version of his epochal "Like a Rolling Stone." Then the soundtrack moves into the triumphant performance of "Like a Rolling Stone" from the 1965 LP that made Mr. Dylan a world figure: "Highway 61 Revisited," the album named for the song, which speaks for the United States itself. Highway 61 traces the spine of the nation, but by this point in the film you're ready to acknowledge every American road as Highway 61.
You've also seen blues singers who have never heard of Bob Dylan singing their Highway 61 songs. You've heard homemade 1950's tapes of Mr. Dylan as a teenage Bobby Zimmerman singing his own composition "Little Richard" and then scorning Presley, Johnny Cash and Ricky Nelson for their thefts and failings. But all of that is now subsumed into the looming night lights of Manhattan. "In a film you can create a whole complex of emotions, a situation, in a single image," Mr. Marsh says. "For 'Wisconsin Death Trip' I was already informed as to the power of the single image: looking at the book and the ghosts staring back at me."
Michael Lesy's book, a new edition of which will be published in February by the University of New Mexico Press, was born 30 years ago when Mr. Lesy, then a graduate student at the University of Wisconsin, found an archive of 3,000 images left by one Charles Van Schaick, the town photographer of Black River Falls. In Van Schaick's time, ordinary people did not have cameras, difficult contraptions that involved black powder and heavy glass plates; to record the passages of a life -- births, marriages, store openings, funerals -- they turned to a professional. Mr. Lesy noticed Van Schaick's many pictures of dead infants and children, dressed in their christening gowns, now placed in tiny coffins. As he looked for the story behind these photos, he found a tale of plagues: of murder, suicide, farm and business failures, madness, addiction, tramp armies, and the ruin of childhood and the desolation of families by epidemics of diptheria, typhoid, smallpox and flu.
Mr. Lesy made a montage, using items from the local paper, contemporaneous regional fiction and poetry, asylum records and the photographs left by Van Schaick, who in Mr. Lesy's pages emerges as Arbus's unknown ancestor. In words, the story was almost too much to take in, the accumulation of awful facts nearly mute in their cacophony. But the pictures spoke. From Van Schaick's archive Mr. Lesy made a tableau of disassociation, terror and insanity passing for everyday life. It was all in the blank eyes, the frozen mouths in family portraits: those were the ghosts James Marsh saw.
Mr. Marsh's "Wisconsin Death Trip" is less a film of Mr. Lesy's book than a quiet reinhabiting of the world it found, or made. "In a way the book is unfilmable," says Mr. Marsh. So he left the book. For the movie, he alternates long black-and-white segments set a century ago -- through prairie-flat re-enactments, you see an 1890's avatar of Susan Smith sitting by the lake where she has drowned her children, a farmer randomly killed by a young boy, farmers who have killed themselves, two women murdered by a tramp they have fed and then the tramp's own suicide, a madwoman traveling the county in search of windows to break, and, in parlor scenes, just how dead children were positioned to have their pictures taken -- with brief, prosaic interludes of present-day Black River Falls shot in color. "What today speaks for the town," says Mr. Marsh, "what binds it, what is undermining it."
"What I did get from the book," Mr. Marsh says, "was the rhythm: the emerging incremental idea. But in terms of the stories themselves, the starting point was definitely photographic. Start with an image, a single image, and then move -- a lot of long tracking shots, to keep a sense of the still image moving. But I knew I couldn't film it. Do I try to contextualize the story, or do I let the stories yield their own mysteries -- or do I have someone sitting in a chair, explaining? That was the first choice I made, not to try and explain the social-political-cultural history of anything. The stories are based on a respect for these individual tragedies and disasters. If the film lacks one thing, it's a governing idea on that level -- but it would have been a travesty."
What one takes away from Mr. Lesy's book are faces. In the film, it's a series of incidents that hangs in the memory like half-remembered dreams: true, undeniable, but unbidden and incomplete. The actors seem both physically present and psychologically anonymous. Often you don't register their faces at all; they could be anyone. "A lot of the casting had to do with financial constraints," Mr. Marsh says. He worked first with a limited "documentary budget" from Arena, then with money he made from projects he took on mainly to pay for "Death Trip." Finally, after rejections from European companies on the ground that the project was, in Mr. Marsh's words, "morbid, distasteful and obsessed with the wrong aspects of human life" and after no response at all from the PBS series "The American Experience," he was rescued by a co-sponsorship from HBO's Cinemax division, which paid for a 35-millimeter print.
"We had open casting calls in Madison and Milwaukee: old thesps from the local theater, lots of people with interesting faces who hadn't acted," Mr. Marsh says. "A lot of the acting was improvised or: 'Do nothing.' 'Stand.' " The re-enactments were shot at 30 frames a second, he says, to get "a barely perceptible slow-motion effect: that disconcerting stillness in the scenes." The actors, he adds, "can't hit marks; they don't know the grammar.
"But most of it wasn't acting; it's like striking poses."
This is the source of the bluntness of the violence that is shown, which in Mr. Marsh's film is far more stark, and seemingly unmediated, than the stylized violence that movies conventionally offer. The ordinariness of the postures and gestures of the actors puts the viewer in their shoes.
You can feel the rope pulling at your throat as a farmer dangles from a tree, go suddenly cold as another lies down in the snow across the railroad tracks, flinch and want to run as a man chases, shoots and kills the woman who will not marry him. You can even feel the deadened peace of the mother at the lake.
The instruction to do nothing, to just stand, also creates the single image, and the single face, that most people will very likely take away from "Wisconsin Death Trip": that of Jo Vukelich as Mary Sweeney, the window smasher. As the film follows her from town to town, as she picks her targets -- with care, apparently, as if in an effort to make meaning, to send a message, to lodge some sort of protest -- you see glass shattering, then a strongly built woman staring straight at those of her fellows who are merely watching her, or those who have come to take her away. Her fearsomely unreadable countenance seems to be insisting that by her actions she has said all that need be said, that through her destructions she is writing the book of her place and time. Only at the end of the movie is any explanation offered, but it's hardly needed. "I am mad but not without my reasons," she seems to say with the turn of her body and the dull gleam in her eyes. "And if you had my courage you would know my reasons are yours."
One "veers and turns," Howie Movshovitz wrote in The Los Angeles Times after seeing the premiere of "Wisconsin Death Trip" at the Telluride Film Festival in September, "trying to avoid the possibility that the history of Black River Falls is not unlike the present all over the country." All that allows you to avoid that conclusion, though, is the sense of insulation, of a world in suspension, that one gets from watching a movie. The day the film was shown at Telluride, in Colorado, the headline in The Denver Post was generic for the reader, singular only for the people in it: "Gunman kills wife, two others at grocery store -- Grand Junction woman had just served divorce papers on husband."
As a historian, Mr. Lesy is a dramatist. Perhaps for that reason, the events he recorded and the people who made them seem very far away. The people in Mr. Marsh's picture are all without affect, and they seem to claim the present as much as the past.
The film realizes the ambitions of its small team (along with Mr. Marsh, the producer, Maureen Ryan; the director of photography, Eigil Bryld, and the editor, Jinx Godfrey): the wish, in Mr. Marsh's words, "to create rhythm, in the shooting and the editing, relentlessly putting together little fragments of stories, building to them and building away from them." What they got, though, was the illusion of a tale complete and whole, a distant story from a century ago that with the force of prophecy seems to rush forward, to our time and past it.

HEADLINE: ART/ARCHITECTURE;
Artistry and Social Compassion in Counterpoint

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP 

 BODY:
ANOTHER opening, another show: surely there are more humane ways than this to think about earthquakes. But unless you have the misfortune to be struck by one, a seismologic event usually arrives packaged as prime-time entertainment, with unctuous news anchors or made-for-TV actors reciting their lines over numbing boom-de-boom soundtracks.
Shigeru Ban, an architect who lives in Tokyo, has not allowed himself the safe distance enjoyed by our remote controllers. In the last five years, he has responded to the news of earthquakes and other disasters as if to a call of conscience. After the Kobe quake in 1994, Mr. Ban designed units of cardboard and plastic housing for the thousands who had been driven from their homes. The following year, he established the Volunteer Architects Network, a nongovernmental agency of the United Nations. This year, under the aegis of that agency, he has coordinated the production and shipment of cardboard housing units for refugees in Turkey. 
 It happens that Mr. Ban is also a brilliant designer of private houses, apartment houses, public buildings and museum exhibitions. In these, he has displayed a striking talent for innovative form, structure and spatial organization. This diverse body of work plays havoc with our Western inclination to plug architects into mutually exclusive categories: the artistically gifted or the socially committed. In Mr. Ban's case, they stem from the same outlook. He himself distinguishes between the refugee housing and his other work, but the difference is one of application, not of the principles behind it. In this work, we are invited to see the social dimension within the aesthetic, the artist inside the humanitarian.
Chief among the principles guiding Mr. Ban's architecture is economy of means. In his houses, this has resulted in the reduction of the dwelling to simple lines and planes and the volumes of space contained within them. The effect is a minimalist aesthetic. It can be appreciated as a look, a style, a fashion. For Mr. Ban, however, architecture is only incidentally concerned with effects. It is mostly a matter of causes.
Mr. Ban, who is 42, is a true cosmopolite. Born in Tokyo in 1957, he studied architecture at the California Institute of the Arts and then Cooper Union in New York, from which he graduated in 1984. In those years, the attention of many Cooper Union students was focused on a group of architects known as the New York Five: Peter Eisenman, Richard Meier, Charles Gwathmey, John Hejduk and Michael Graves. The five were also called the Whites, because their forms were typically rendered as colorless geometric abstractions.
Returning to Japan, Mr. Ban began his professional practice with a series of Case Study houses that gave so-called White architecture a Japanese twist. These spare exercises are dominated by the Cartesian grid, a form that had assumed nearly sacred status among the Five as a link with Mies van der Rohe and Le Corbusier. In Mr. Ban's projects, the grid form also became a bond with Japanese tradition: the architecture of the shoji screen, the tatami mat and the flexible division of space.
In the West, Mr. Ban is best known for the Curtain Wall House, a 1995 project with billowing drapery that was featured earlier this year in the "(Un)private House" show at the Museum of Modern Art. But his most radical example of East-West fusion is the Wall-less House, a project completed two years ago in the rural town of Karuizawa. The design is a play on the Wall House, an unbuilt project by John Hejduk, in which pockets of dwelling space are suspended from an upright concrete slab. In Mr. Ban's house, which occupies a hillside site, the slab is rotated into a horizontal position to create a floor. The slab curves upward at one end, where it meets the sloping ground. A thinner slab is cantilevered from the upturned edge to form the roof, which is additionally supported by two slender columns at the far end.
Apart from the hillside, which serves as an earth berm, there are no exterior walls, no fixed partitions between floor and roof. Screens can be moved into place to conceal or reveal bathroom, bedroom and kitchen. The largest permanent fixture is a kitchen counter cantilevered from the upturn in the floor slab. The curve of the counter's underside echoes that of the upturn and of the ground to which the house is moored.
In this almost unrelieved horizontal composition, the eye is magnetically drawn most powerfully to the bathroom sink, crowned with a round mirror, that sits on the outward perimeter of the floor slab. A pair of fixtures typically clamped against a wall, the arrangement underscores the absence of perpendicular planes. It also reads as a comic play on the view that practical considerations like plumbing are what distinguish architecture from sculpture. Here, we get the bathroom sink without the bathroom.
Mr. Ban's work with cardboard -- or what he calls paper -- architecture began with installations he designed in the mid-1980's for shows on the work of Emilio Ambasz and Alvar Aalto. Later, he began to work with paper structurally, using cardboard tubes. Employing steel cables to compress the tubes, Mr. Ban continued the experiments in tensile structure developed by Buckminster Fuller, Frei Otto and Robert Le Ricolais. (New Yorkers will get to see an example of this technique next summer, when the Museum of Modern Art will enclose part of its sculpture garden beneath Mr. Ban's open, lattice-like roof.)
Mr. Ban's first venture into refugee housing came in response to the 1994 civil strife in Rwanda. Deforestation had depleted the timber needed for building shelters. Working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr. Ban designed simple tents of blue plastic sheets, using cardboard tubes to support them. Fifty units were eventually shipped abroad.
THE shelters Mr. Ban designed for refugees of the Kobe earthquake were more ambitious. These were miniature one-room houses made of cardboard, with operable door and windows. Plastic beer can crates, filled with sacks of sand, provided foundations for the simple, pitched-roof pavilions. Mr. Ban also designed a community church made from cardboard tube columns, arranged in an elliptical shape. The Kobe housing became the model for the shelters that BMr. an's United Nations group has deployed in Turkey this year.
The connection between Mr. Ban's humanitarian work and his Case Study houses is more easily seen if one compares the relief housing to minimalist art. Mr. Ban's use of humble materials, his elemental Monopoly-house shape and his repetition of the basic module echo themes developed in the work of Donald Judd, Carl Andre and Dan Flavin. The cracked earth, meanwhile assumes the cosmic dimension of landscape in 15th century Japanese ink painting.
Cosmopolitanism today signifies much more than urban sophistication. It also denotes awareness that the globe is rapidly urbanizing in some highly unsophisticated ways. This is true even in relatively modern countries like Turkey. Those jerry-built, orange masonry housing blocks, many occupied by squatters, are familiar to anyone who has taken a taxi from Istanbul's airport into town. Cosmopolitanism also means knowing that land is part of the earth, that the earth is finite and has plans of its own, that the undeveloped land that developers like to call greentop is linked to something larger, and therefore so is architecture. As such, there is a sacred aspect to the relationship between even secular buildings and the space they occupy.
Mr. Ban's description of his relief work as paper architecture is ironic. In the West, the term refers to unbuilt projects designed by architects like Mr. Hejduk, who hold themselves in such artistic high regard that they seldom deign to build. Kenneth Frampton, the architectural historian, once observed that, in the 1970's, architecture became divided between those who sought to practice architecture as a form of fine art and those who approached it as direct social action. Hailing from a country where paper has long been a common building material, Mr. Ban has embraced the cause of healing the quake in his profession.

Festival in Bethlehem
The Town of Bethlehem in Connecticut is braced for the thousands of visitors who will attend its 19th holiday festival from Thursday evening through Saturday. Mostly, they come to the quiet Litchfield County community to go to the post office.
Many years ago the Bethlehem postmaster initiated the practice of decorating customers' Christmas cards with a special Christmas cachet. Out-of-towners began arriving in droves with their stacks of cards, not only for the cachet but also to mail them bearing the Bethlehem postmark. 
 Soon, even with extended hours, the post office could only accommodate so many people at a time, leaving lots of visitors and local people milling about. Naturally, a full blown festival evolved.
There will be music and readings on Thursday evening at 7:30 in Memorial Hall, followed by Friday's activities beginning at 5 p.m. with the arrival of Santa Claus and the lighting of a 90-foot tree.
Until 10 p.m. on Friday and all day Saturday, from 10 to 5, there will be music by choirs, bell ringers, bands and madrigal singers; hay rides, exhibits at the Bellamy-Ferriday House and Garden and the Old Bethlem Historical Society Museum; visits to the 18th-century Neapolitan creche at the Abbey of Regina Laudis, readings by authors of children's books, and a vast array of crafts, gifts and holiday foods to browse and buy.
The town is at the junction of Routes 61 and 132 in Litchfield County. For more information, call (203) 266-5557.
 
Remembering Gary Cooper
Today, from 10 to noon, the Abbey of Regina Laudis will mark the first weekend of its annual Christmas Fair with a book signing by Maria Cooper Janis, the only child of Gary Cooper and his wife, Rocky. Ms. Janis has written a book about her famous Dad, called "Gary Cooper Off Camera: A Daughter Remembers."
An intimate portrait of the actor, his family life and his legendary career have been revealed by Ms. Janis through material from her own journals and from her father's writings. The book also contains a treasury of photographs of Cooper and Picasso, Cooper and Hemingway, Cooper and Sinatra -- and many others that have never been published.
For more information or directions to the abbey, call (203) 266-7637.
 
Connecticut Forum
The nonprofit Connecticut Forum has put together one of its customary power panels for a discussion on "Global Issues, Global Views," to be presented on Saturday at 8 p.m. at the Bushnell in Hartford.
Its mission to raise the public level of communication about world events, conflicts and issues is evident in the mere mention of the names serving on this panel.
They are Senator George Mitchell, special adviser to the President and Secretary of State for economic initiatives in Ireland; Benazir Bhutto, former Pakistani Prime Minister, author of "Foreign Policy in Perspective" and "Daughter of Destiny"; Jeane Kirkpatrick, former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, and Medal of Freedom honoree; and as moderator, Ray Suarez, senior correspondent for the Jim Lehrer News Hour on Public Television, and host of "Talk of the Nation" on National Public Radio.
Tickets at $25, $35, and $45 may be reserved by calling (860) 509-0909.
 
Vintage Radios
What to do with that old Atwater Kent tabletop radio stashed in the attic? Head for the Antique Radio Swap Meet on Saturday from 8 to 1 at St. John's Parish Hall, Main Street and Burnside Avenue in East Hartford.
Once a year, the Vintage Radio and Communications Museum of Connecticut holds this event, allowing radio buffs to buy, sell and check out the flea market for an admission price of $1. Vendors can rent a table for $12.
The museum, a nonprofit company founded in 1990, is dedicated to the preservation of vintage communications equipment, and to educating the public about its value as history and as collectibles.
At its 711 Main St. site in East Hartford the museum displays radios, televisions, motion picture and telephone equipment, old advertising and memorabilia. Audio, video and paper libraries are available for research on Thursdays and even-dated Fridays from 10 to 2, Saturdays from 11 to 4, and Sundays from 1 to 4. Call (860) 675-9916 or (860) 683-0496 for more information.
 
Author Lectures
Authors who have interesting day jobs of one sort or another will share their expertise in a series of lectures at the Garden Education Center in Greenwich this week.
Tomorrow, from 11 to 2, Sally Maraventano, culinary tour leader to regions of Italy, will be the first speaker. Her subject will be "Festa del Giardino: A Feast of Italian Recipes and the Memories Surrounding Them," drawn from her experiences in writing her new vegetable cookbook. A fee of $50 includes lunch.
Donald Kaufman, a founding partner of Donald Kaufman Color, a consulting firm, will talk about his new book, "Color and Light, Luminous Atmospheres for Painted Rooms," on Wednesday at 10 a.m. His observations include the fact that light passing thorugh the air affects how we see color. Example: a terra cotta-painted wall in Santa Fe looks very different from a terra cotta-painted wall in Manhattan. Tickets are $25.
"The Writer in the Garden" by Jane Garney explores the craziness that otherwise sane, successful people like Edith Wharton or Charles Kuralt experience when they obsess over their gardens, plants and flowers. Ms. Garney has collected vignettes from more than 50 people, forming an usual how-to and how-not-to for gardeners everywhere. The fee for the Friday lecture at 10 a.m. is $25.
Call the center on Bible Street, at (203) 869-9242 to register or obtain more information. ELEANOR CHARLES

A new interactive atlas, available on the Web at www.nationalgeographic.com /mapmachine, will record the latest geographical and political changes so that users can download maps and paste them into their atlases. This feature will be available by the end of the month, according to Allen Carroll, the society's chief cartographer. As of mid-November, there were two changes: the Black Canyon of the Gunnison in Colorado, formerly a national monument, was expanded and became a national park, and the height of Mount Everest was increased from 29,028 to 29,035 feet. 
 The seventh edition, published this month, is a complete reworking of the sixth edition, which was first published in 1990 and subsequently revised. It takes account of such major changes as the renaming of Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo), the creation of the Nunavut Territory in Canada and the redrawing of provincial boundaries in South Africa.
As in the past, the atlas, which sells for $125, roams beyond the strictly cartographic, with articles on such subjects as climate, economy, tectonics, cultures and energy. All told, there are 280 pages of maps and text plus a 134-page index with 140,000 entries.
Those who prefer more rather than less will be cheered to know that the Web site has two million entries. Some are variations on place names (separate entries for Florence and Firenze, for example); others are place names that that simply could not be included even in a large-format atlas.

Juneau Votes to Charge Cruise Passenger Fees

 BODY:
Voters in Juneau, Alaska, last month approved by a 5-to-2 ratio an initiative to charge each cruise ship passenger $5 for visiting their city. The result came three months after a guilty plea by the Royal Caribbean International cruise line to charges of dumping pollutants into Alaskan waters. A similar measure failed three years ago, Mayor Dennis W. Egan said.
Mayor Egan said that despite apologies to three southeastern Alaska cities by the president of Royal Caribbean, the residents remained outraged. The line, which agreed in court to pay $18 million in fines, pleaded guilty to polluting coastal waters around the United States; this included dumping dry-cleaning chemicals and other toxic wastes into a channel within the Juneau city limits and dumping oily bilge water into a canal between Skagway and Haines. 
 The convention and visitors bureau in Juneau, the state capital, estimates that nearly 600,000 cruise passengers visited the city in the 1999 season -- May through September -- and that they accounted for most of the $90 million in economic activity generated by tourism.
Although many Caribbean islands levy port charges on ships based on passenger totals, cruise lines operating in Alaska may challenge the user fee on the basis that it is too narrow: visitors arriving by plane or car are not similarly surcharged. John Hansen, president of the North West CruiseShip Association, based in Vancouver, British Columbia, said that the group would examine its constitutionality. "There may be some legal issues with a narrow, targeted fee," Mr. Hansen said. "On another level, what is the money going to be used for: dock development, tourism improvements or just for the city's operating budget?"
Mayor Egan said that a regulation, to be effective March 1, was being written on the basis of the referendum. He said that the income would be spent on infrastructure improvements related to the cruise industry, possibly including landscaping.

HEADLINE: The Assault On Good News

 BODY:
Andrew Sullivan cites falling poverty and joblessness rates as evidence that the poor in America never had it so good (Counter Culture, Nov. 7). But these indicators mask ugly realities. For the past decade, we have kept the household income threshold that officially denotes poverty at an absurdly low level; in addition, the proliferation of low-wage jobs has shattered the traditional link between finding full-time work and escaping poverty. Government and private economists agree that the bottom 40 percent of United States households are worse off now than they were 20 years ago. This is not an invention of the political left, and it should be discussed and debated in the coming presidential election campaign -- Sullivan's swipes at Bill Bradley notwithstanding.

Safety in Numbers

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank; Robert H. Frank is a professor of economics at Cornell University and the author of "Luxury Fever."

 BODY:
It seems almost funny to remember that as recently as the 1980's, hardly anyone outside the financial industry had any real interest in forecasting stock prices. An exception was one of my colleagues, a professor who actively managed his own portfolio long before the advent of Internet trading. His crowning achievement was predicting the October 1987 crash with far greater accuracy than almost all the experts. In the weeks following the crash, many stepped forward claiming to have seen it coming, but almost alone among them, my colleague had taken a major chunk of his money out of the market just weeks before it happened. In the risk-averse world of tenured academics, this gutsy move earned him instant superstar status.
These days, of course, you seldom meet anyone who is not an expert stock picker. A natural outgrowth of this phenomenon has recently begun to take form: our nation of stock pickers is rapidly turning into a nation of economic forecasters. 
 The mainstream media's coverage of hard economic data used to be perfunctory: a spot of news about the direction of interest rates, or a calculation of how the dollar was holding up against the yen. Now these reports have grown bewilderingly detailed and complex. One recent morning, a cable-network news reader reported with a straight face that although the monthly trade deficit had shown a sharp decline in the quarter just ended, the movement should not be interpreted as a positive indicator because export figures contained a large commercial aircraft shipment that markets had known about for months. Another correspondent advised viewers that the rise in the wholesale price index should be discounted heavily, because much of it was attributable to movements in traditionally volatile energy components.
Every day, some government agency reports at least one major figure, and the financial-news channels cover it with the pageantry and suspense of the Academy Award nominations. A couple of weeks ago, the day-by-day fix went like this: Monday was Business Inventories, Tuesday was a double dose of Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization, Wednesday we got the Consumer Price Index, Housing Starts and Building Permits and Thursday was International Trade. Friday, we were permitted to rest.
I'm a university economist and the author of several books about how the economy works, and even I had to ask, who cares? Aside from people whose work is directly dependent on these figures, who would be interested in them? And what in the world can individual investors possibly learn from this endless torrent of information? If, say, we find out that sales of existing homes in the Southwest were expected to rise 0.3 percent in September but actually rose only 0.25 percent, should we shift our portfolios to firms in the Pacific Northwest? Or divest them of stock in roofing-nail suppliers?
Whatever we decide to do, it's a sure bet that the market has already beaten us to it. Economists disagree about many things, but one belief we share is that investors can almost never make financial headway by trading on the basis of numbers they hear about through the media.
That, however, has not stopped the number of financial-news outlets from proliferating still further in recent months. Countless new Web sites and cable channels and newsletters and e-mail services urge their services upon us. Indeed, the reporting of financial trivia now threatens to drown out all other news.
This information does serve an important function, just not the one it claims to serve. What it is, in fact, is a palliative to ease our anxiety about the eventual downturn. Old-school Wall Street cognoscenti have generally stuck to the view that the current boom will come to a spectacular end. As in 1929, we may wake up one morning to find all those paper billions up in smoke. But as the market has continued its ascent, swelling our faith in ourselves as master investors, fatalism has been tempered by the idea that a crash need not take down everyone. In a world in which investors make millions from trading stock in companies that may never earn a dime, official economic data provide a reassuring kind of white noise. They won't help the citizen-investor predict whether Amazon.com stock is a good buy, but they're pure and direct and unimpeachable: this is your government talking, this is the state of your country. More than that, the numbers make this tantalizing promise: If we just keep watching them, maybe we'll spot the downturn in time to bail out.
But if and when the crash does come, the number crunchers who manage to get out in time will confront a second challenge. They must decide when to get back in. And here the experience of my colleague who sold out just before the 1987 crash sounds a cautionary note. "I thought prices would continue to decline for at least the next year," he once told me with chagrin, "so I wasn't eager to get back in the market right away." But as often happens, prices began to recover almost immediately after the October downturn, and by the time my colleague finally got back into the market in mid-1988, prices were higher than when he'd sold. He has no illusions that he would have done any better if only those critical Capacity Utilization reports had been blasted over the airwaves back then.

Chart: "Reading Greenspan: An Indicator"
 
Mark Haines, anchor of CNBC's morning finance program "Squawk Box," on the rise and fall of the show's Briefcase Indicator:
 
"The premise is that the thickness of Alan Greenspan's briefcase -- when he's leaving his office to meet with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors -- is an indicator of whether they plan to change interest rates. A full briefcase indicates that they are.
 
"It was right 17 out of the first 20 times, but has a built-in destruct mechanism, because Greenspan packs his briefcase. He can make it wrong or right. He has never publicly acknowledged the Indicator, but we have reason to believe that he knows about it. We have to consider the fact that he wants us to stop doing it because the last two times the briefcase has been wrong, and that's disturbing."

HEADLINE: Not Enough Substitute Teachers To Go Around

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG 

DATELINE: CROTON-ON-HUDSON

 BODY:
WHEN Janet Lindner shows up for work on any given morning at Croton High School, she always carries a briefcase with the basic tools of her trade: scissors, Post-Its, Scotch tape, a stapler, pens and paper. After that, it is her more than 25 years' experience as a full-time substitute teacher that helps her maintain her equilibrium, whether she is asked to lead a chemistry experiment, supervise a French test or teach physics.
Such versatility might unnerve many regular teachers, accustomed to the routines of their permanent classroom domain. Not Mrs. Lindner, who chose to be a substitute teacher to have time to manage family responsibilities. 
 "This is my career," Mrs. Lindner said. "When kids say, 'You're a sub,' I say, 'I'm your teacher.' You have to let the kids know you're a teacher. It's not baby-sitting. It's an honor for teachers to ask for me to come in, and it's a pleasure for me to go."
Mrs. Lindner is a well-trained, experienced substitute teacher, whose competency and cooperative attitude could make school administrators the envy of their peers -- not only in the county but also in the rest the state, Connecticut, New Jersey and across the country.
There is one small problem. There are not enough Mrs. Lindners to go around, even in Croton-on-Hudson.
"We continually try to add to our substitute list," said Dr. Marjorie Castro, superintendent of the Croton-Harmon school district, which recently increased its daily pay for substitute teachers to $75 from $65. "We try to cultivate people wherever we can."
For many districts that are struggling to find qualified full-time staff, finding equally competent substitutes is just as challenging.
"There's not enough supply," said Dr. Stacy Holmes, district superintendent for the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services. "Our people are sharing frustrations at getting enough people. Time has to be productively spent. It can't be just baby-sitting."
With school administrators, teachers and parents concerned about meeting the state's more rigorous instructional standards and making sure students are prepared for new state tests, few districts can afford to miss productive time in the classroom. That means recruiting, training and retaining the best possible substitute teachers.
"The exams are high stake, which adds a layer of tension, and makes it more complex," said Dr. Judith Fox, superintendent of the Byram Hills Central school district in Armonk. "I'm discouraged. It's a seller's market."
What makes the situation more difficult, educators say, is in some measure a result of the new requirements.
"It's a critical situation," said Dr. Constance Iervolino, assistant superintendent for curriculum in the White Plains public schools. "I've never seen it as bad as this year. I think it's because a lot of teachers who intended to be substitutes got jobs right away.
"There's a need for staff development, which has not been at the same level of urgency in the past. With the new assessments, there's a tremendous need for staff development, but the state doesn't build that into the calendar. There's the tension of releasing teachers from the class and having the class covered in a meaningful way. It's a major headache."
For instance, Dr. Iervolino said, "The state has dictated that some of the tests, like the English language arts, be done in a regional scoring situation. That means that in White Plains, I'll have 33 teachers absent over 3 days, days that the kids will be in school. It's catastrophic. There's real pressure to not reduce teacher contact time and to get the best substitutes. The state really needs to extend the school year for teachers to allow for training before and after the school year."
As Dr. Holmes said, "With the need to take teachers out of the classroom, we're catching it from both directions. It's a scramble."
Under state regulations, there is no "substitute teacher" certification -- substitutes are either certified as teachers or there is no certification. A district unable to find a certified teacher to substitute in a classroom may hire people with a college degree as a substitute for up to 40 days a year. Similar rules exist in Connecticut. In New Jersey, someone who has at least 60 hours of instruction from an accredited college may substitute for up to 20 consecutive days a year. In both Connecticut and New Jersey, criminal background checks are expected for anyone hired by a school district.
"Getting substitute teachers who are qualified and trained is a major problem," said Donald McKenzie, district superintendent for the Putnam/Northern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services, whose organization not only developed a computerized system to help link substitutes with daily vacancies but also ran a recent Saturday training session to recruit substitutes.
"Districts can't afford to lose a minute of instructional time," McKenzie said. "There are not enough people who hold teaching certificates who want to be substitutes. The challenges of being a substitute, with the challenges of increasing curriculum demands, makes it difficult. We're keenly aware of the shortages, and we've tried to build the pool on a number of different levels."
Dr. Salvatore Corda, superintendent of the Peekskill schools, said "The pool of substitutes is not as deep as it was five years ago" because "people are in full-time jobs."
Charles C. Mackey, director of the Office of Teaching Initiatives for the State Department of Education, said: "It is a chronic issue endemic to the entire state. It exists in urban, rural and suburban areas."
There are many factors that have contributed to the substitute shortage, among them a strong economy that offers potential teachers, retirees or stay-at-home moms other employment options.
"There are a number of market forces coming into play for the shortages," said Thomas Murphy, a spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Education. "The largest labor market group for substitutes has traditionally been aspiring teachers. In Connecticut, we scooped up a bigger portion of those for full-time teaching. There have also been a lot of retirements, and many of the stay-at-home moms who used to be substitutes are working in the corporate economy."
Some districts have tried innovation to ease the situation. In Connecticut, for example, the Norwich district had a town meeting to invite parents and community members to apply for substitute teacher positions. In West Haven, the district offers an extension of enhanced health benefits to retired teachers to lure them back to the classroom.
Some districts are also working with undergraduate and graduate schools of education to find substitutes, and they contacted former teachers, retirees and parents. In some schools, the teacher aides, librarians and even administrators are tapped for substitute work -- as are teachers themselves. At Westlake High School in Thornwood, the principal, Louis Cuglietto, recently took over a chemistry course for nearly two weeks when the school was between teachers in that subject.
Some districts have turned to parents to act as noncertified substitutes, with varying results.
In some places, like Croton, it has been a boon for the district.
"We always say we look for the very best person we can find," said Dr. Castro, the Croton superintendent. "We know them, they know the schools, they're committed to the schools, and that's a plus. They have to be very professional, and we have an evaluation for the classroom teacher to fill out on how they did."
For one Croton parent, Elise Yates, who has been substituting in the elementary school since September, there is never any question about her role. "When I'm in the classroom, my son knows I'd be 'Mrs. Yates,' not 'Mommy,' " she said. Mrs. Yates, who had previously been in advertising, has a son in the eighth grade and another in the first grade. "I look at teaching in the same professional way as I would any other job."
Peter M. Lisi, superintendent of the Pocantico Hills Central school district, said: "We don't hire parents. There's an inherent problem with the students' having a relationship with someone's parent that makes it difficult for that parent to now be a teacher. We feel very strongly about who is standing before the kids. Our administrators cover classrooms on occasion, and if there is a substitute on a given day, either I or our assistant principal floats into the classroom. We may pull our teachers from a prep period to rotate through a classroom. We never put an unknown commodity in the classroom and close the door."
Districts want to avoid scenarios like the following. Earlier this fall, a noncertified parent substitute left a kindergarten child, who had been unable to gather up her belongings in time, alone in the classroom at dismissal. The child missed her bus. Her mother was not called, and there were serious questions raised about the safety of the children under that substitute's supervision.
Financial incentives offer another motivation. In Peekskill, Dr. Corda said, the district not only provides a handbook designed to acquaint substitutes with policies and procedures and installs a greeter in each building to help substitutes find their way but it also has a tiered compensation system to encourage long-term relationships. The basic daily rate for a substitute is $65; a substitute who works 3 days out of 5 receives $85 a day and a substitute who works 10 consecutive days receives $95 a day.
In Edgemont, where the district recently raised its substitute rate from $60 to $70 a day, the district has permanent substitutes on call in each building.
"Our priority is having people who know what we want to teach and who care about students," said Nancy Taddiken, superintendent in the Edgemont Union Free school district. "It could be a paraprofessional, like a teacher's aide, who knows the routine and knows the children."

HEADLINE: New Brunswick, Meet New Haven

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN 

 BODY:
DAVID SAINT and Doug Hughes don't just believe that regional theaters should work together; they are making it happen with two new plays: "Down the Garden Paths," by Anne Meara, and "Syncopation," by Allan Knee.
Mr. Saint, artistic director of George Street Playhouse in New Brunswick, and Mr. Hughes, his counterpart at Long Wharf in New Haven, are co-producing, collaborating, pooling resources, dividing expenses, and lengthening the lives of plays and the employment of actors. 
 On Tuesday, "Down the Garden Paths" opened at George Street; it moves to Long Wharf in January. "Syncopation" opened at Long Wharf the same night and also moves in January.
"A co-production gives the play a chance to be worked on in two venues, both outside New York," Mr. Saint said. "Working in New York is an invitation to excruciating pressure. You're constantly under the gun by theaters that want to make sure the first audience sees a finished product, or else the word will get out there and we're finished. 'Give us a chance to create something here, folks,' you want to say. Here, we have that great opportunity."
During rehearsals of "Syncopation" at Long Wharf, Mr. Hughes said: "We do our work so often to tear it down." That often means "taking stuff to the Dumpster," he said, "and I've always been unhappy about that."
Actors who immerse themselves in a role and want to deepen it, with no thought of racing on to the next one, are especially foiled by short runs. Mr. Saint recalled Penny Fuller's remark on the closing night of George Street's recent production of the musical "Do I Hear a Waltz?": "Now I'm ready to open," Ms. Fuller said.
A regional theater production can have its run of, say, four or five weeks, or it can fulfill the wish, if not the mission, of nonprofit theater, "to go on to an extended commercial afterlife," Mr. Hughes said. He is delighted there is "something in the middle," he added.
That something in the middle -- an alliance between two important regional theaters -- happened in recent seasons between the McCarter Theater in Princeton and the Hartford Stage (Shakespeare's "Cymbeline," staged by Mark Lamos) and between Long Wharf and the McCarter (John Henry Redwood's "Old Settler").
It helps that Mr. Saint and Mr. Hughes, friends for 20 years, have had a professional affiliation in tandem and overlapping. Mr. Saint assisted Mr. Hughes when the latter was associate artistic director at Manhattan Theater Club from 1980 to 1982; he began directing at Seattle Repertory in 1990, when Mr. Hughes was associate artistic director there. When Mr. Hughes went on to the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis as head of the creative department, Mr. Saint wound up succeeding him in Seattle.
Critically speaking, the audience at the second theater benefits from a play refined by time.
"We continue to wave the flag for the new American play," Mr. Hughes said. And he cheered "this sort of shared responsibility for producing one and extending its life -- providing the luxury of a longer run -- especially when we have compatible tastes and the flexibility of dovetailing our schedules with crisscrossing productions."
Both theaters reap economic advantages. "We can stretch our money across the season," Mr. Hughes said. "This deal allowed Long Wharf to lavish more on cast size in other productions, to make sure the population of our stage doesn't dwindle."
And Mr. Saint added, "We share costs without compromising artistic merit."
Ms. Meara made her playwriting debut with "After-Play." Mr. Saint directed it as his first George Street production two seasons ago with Ms. Meara in the cast.
"Down the Garden Paths," a nine-character play that takes place in one night, depicts "three different configurations in one family," Ms. Meara said. "It's about the what-ifs that happen in life."
In the play's parallel realities, a writer receives a prestigious award, and the family celebration is viewed in three different ways. Amy Stiller, daughter of Ms. Meara and Jerry Stiller, plays a daughter in one reality, a granddaughter in another. Mr. Stiller appears on video. Roberta Wallach, daughter of Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, who are also in the cast, appears twice as the same character.
Mr. Saint said the play dealt with "alternate realities within one family, deep metaphysical thoughts and quantum physics." But he added, "It is funny and deeply moving, and by the time it ends, you're devastated."
"Syncopation" is set in 1911, when ballroom dancing was all the rage. Such dancing was still popular in the 1950's when Mr. Knee was growing up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan; he remembers being taken to dance contests at the old Madison Square Garden.
In the two-character play, being staged at Long Wharf after a series of readings in New York, dance is a metaphor for partnering and the struggles inherent in all relationships, Mr. Knee said.
"In New York, there is such a shortage of theaters, people keep hoping a play will close," Ms. Meara said. Regional theater collaboration "is wonderful," she added. "Instead of being confrontational, theaters are supportive."
"Down the Garden Paths" continues through Dec. 19 at the George Street Playhouse, 9 Livingston Avenue, New Brunswick; (732) 246-7717. From Jan. 19 to Feb. 20, it moves to the Long Wharf Theater, 229 Sargent Drive, New Haven; (203) 787-4282. "Syncopation" continues through Dec. 19 at Long Wharf and plays at George Street from Jan. 8 to Feb. 6.

Rutgers Estimates Its Value To the State, In Dollars

BYLINE: By KAREN DEMASTERS

 BODY:
Rutgers University contributes $2.19 billion to the state economy in salaries, taxes and other expenditures each year, according to a study conducted by the university.
The university directly and indirectly accounts for 28,600 jobs, 8,000 of which are made up of faculty and other staff members, according to Joseph J. Seneca, vice president of academic affairs and chairman of the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisers. As a research institution with more than 130 research centers, the university holds 238 patents, has formed 31 start-up companies and earned more than $8.1 million in income from royalties and accumulated equities last year. 
 Many students in Rutgers' 29 schools and colleges have requirements to provide community service. During the last decade students provided 425,000 hours of community service, according to the study, which also noted that 60 percent of the 300,000 living Rutgers alumni live within the state.

Air Carrier to County

 BODY:
Atlas Air, the third largest air cargo carrier in the United States, will lease 120,000 square feet of space at Texaco's Corporate Center at 2000 Westchester Avenue in Harrison beginning in the spring.
The company, listed on the New York Stock Exchange as CGO, is planning to invest $8 million in Westchester on construction and new equipment and add jobs over the next five years as part of an expansion plan. Initially, 295 employees will be moved from a division at Kennedy International Airport, and an additional 55 will come from the company's headquarters in Golden, Colo. 
 Its fleet of 18 Boeing 747's will continue to operate out of Kennedy International. Atlas is a United States certificated air carrier for some of the world's leading international carriers, operating scheduled flights to 101 cities in 46 countries.
Michael Chowdry, chairman, chief executive and president of Atlas, said new contracts and customers had produced a 42 percent increase in the company's revenues in the last year, prompting staff increases.
"We had outgrown our facilities in Golden and at J.F.K., and the lease on the J.F.K. facility was set to expire in June of next year," Mr. Chowdry said.
Westchester's Office of Economic Development worked with the Empire State Development Corporation and Texaco, which had unused space available, to bring Atlas to the county. Atlas will receive a $4 million incentive package from the state, Con Edison and the Westchester Industrial Development Agency.

HEADLINE: ACCIDENTAL TRADER;
A Ticker Symbol, Writ Much Larger

BYLINE: By RAY LEWIS; The Accidental Trader column, chronicling the experiences of non-professional investors, will appear occasionally in the Investing pages of Money & Business. Ray Lewis is assistant to the technology editor of The Times.

 BODY:
AH, China. I bought my tiny piece of the awakening giant, in the form of a struggling penny-stock steel company, more than a year ago. That was long before the country struck its trade agreement with the United States this month, prompting a buying frenzy.
I'd like to say I was prescient. But actually, I had expected the company to fold, not to skyrocket. My motivation in buying the stock was extremely odd, and I am not sure I understand it even now. You see, I had $300 in leftover cash after buying shares of a group of blue-chip technology leaders -- America Online, Qualcomm, Sun Microsystems -- and I wanted to buy at least 100 shares of something. Sorting through microcap stocks was too much work, so I looked for total losers, which some call value stocks these days. 
 I stumbled upon a list, from an e-brokerage firm, of 50 small stocks with terrible 52-week price performance: I decided to pick the stock with the most evocative ticker symbol.
To assemble 99.5 percent of my portfolio, I had used accepted, tedious valuation techniques -- price-to-earnings multiples and so on -- so perhaps I was just being defiant with the remainder of my cash. It is also possible that I was nervous, because my other stocks were doing well, and I subconsciously wanted a dud to provide a sort of karmic balance.
Whatever the reasons, I culled through the ticker symbols. Most of them were meaningless.
Then I came across CHNA, for China Pacific Inc., a Chinese iron and steel maker. The company had a mountain of debt and declining revenue. The stock price had plunged $13 in the past year, to 75 cents, on the Nasdaq small-cap market. Prospects for the company were dim, and Asian economies were in recession.
But oh, that stock symbol. Gazing at it, I supplied the missing "I" to come up with "China." Buying the stock would be like buying an entire country. Impressed, I got 360 shares.
During the next several months, my CHNA failed to pay its debts. Nasdaq delisted it. The stock price dropped from 75 to 25 cents.
Then, on March 2, China Pacific entered bankruptcy, and the ticker symbol was eventually changed to CHNAQ. I almost sold, because, after all, the nifty ticker symbol had been a fundamental reason for buying. But I seemed to have developed a ghoulish desire to watch it suffer. (A "Q," as I learned only a few days ago, is the ticker designation of a bankrupt company.)
By October, CHNAQ had fallen to 8 cents a share -- a 90 percent loss for me. The end seemed near.
Then, on Nov. 17, the lid blew sky high. The stock jumped to 50 cents in early morning trading. I was excited. Had the company somehow paid off its debt? Perhaps it had received a buyout offer? I drank my Bengal Spice tea and headed to work.
By the time I got to the office, China Pacific was already at $2 a share. Was the company selling slag over the Internet? Then it hit $3.50. I started to feel woozy. A frantic search for news turned up nothing. (Note to Terry, my boss: I did this on my lunch hour.)
The stock peaked at $12.375. In one morning, the value of my holdings had increased from $28.80 to $4,455, a gain of more than 15,000 percent. But the price stayed there only 10 minutes before dropping back to $5. (I missed the last leg of that run-up, as well as the plunge, having stepped away from my computer to attend a meeting -- and I'm grateful for that. I think I would have pulled my head off if I had seen those gyrations.)
WHY didn't I sell? I choked. In the past, I bailed out of a stock after deciding that its price had risen beyond a reasonable level. But this was beyond imagination. I couldn't make any sense of the numbers. I felt powerless.
Late in the afternoon, I saw a wire report about the China buying mania that resulted, of course, from the trade pact. I regained my bearings and got greedy. The stock settled at $2, and I refused to sell and take a $10 "loss" from the intraday high. That evening, I said to a friend, "If I'd margined 100,000 shares on Tuesday afternoon for a lousy $8,000 and sold at the peak Wednesday, I'd have a pretax profit of $1.23 million."
Thoughts like this, and a look at my portfolio, made me lose my way again. The returns on most of my other stocks were better than ever, but CHNAQ, my little running dog of mainland capitalism, had outperformed every stock I had ever sold and almost every one I still held.
It was, I thought, time to get out. Shortly after the opening bell on Thursday, I sat at the keyboard, humbled by the market's machinations, and tapped out a market order. I sold my 360 shares at $3.875, for a profit of $1,125, a gain of 417 percent.
I learned one thing. During the last two years of investing, I've often wondered how crazy the market would have to get before I'd sell my positions. The answer: when it makes me crazy.
I haven't looked at CHNAQ's price since. I often critique my investing decisions, but this one made so little sense in the buying or the selling that I don't regret a thing.

Undertaker Feels the Ebb Tide of a Sinking Crime Rate

BYLINE: By GUILLAUME DEBRE 

 BODY:
It was very quiet one recent week at La Paz Funeral Home in Mott Haven. Just a single case, an old person who passed away from natural causes.
The South Bronx has changed drastically in the last few years. It is no longer a neighborhood of fear and death, plagued by gangs and crack, guns and syringes. And everyone seems cheered by the revival. 
 Everyone but the undertaker.
Since the rebirth of the area, business has never been so bad, said Hector Marquez, 57, who has owned La Paz since 1977. "Ten, or even five, years ago we used to do a crime-related case every week or two," he said. "Now that it is clean, it is down to once a year."
In 1994, he said, he buried 400 clients. Last year it was 275. This year, he predicts, it will be worse.
La Paz stands squat at 285 East 149th Street, across from Lincoln Hospital. Everyone jokes that it is a great location for a funeral business, and not so long ago it was flourishing.
"When the economy was bad, people used to go out, to drink, to have accidents, they got stabbed, they did drugs," Mr. Marquez said. "Now that people have jobs, they just buy cable, stay at home and watch all the movies in the world."
Still, Mr. Marquez, who lives above La Paz, is pleased by the neighborhood's revival. "It is very safe, very clean," he said.
But his business is indisputably bad. The mortality rate in Mott Haven, a neighborhood of 130,000, dropped by 28 percent between 1994 and 1998 -- double the 14 percent decrease for the city as a whole.
Besides economic growth and a drop in crime, experts say new H.I.V. treatments explain this reduction.
"We had one case a month" involving AIDS in the late 1080's, said Robert Klein, 55, La Paz's licensed funeral director.
Seated in his dark, airless office, just below a handmade sign saying all funerals must be paid for the night before burial, Mr. Marquez also attributes some of the drop in business to cremation.
"A few years ago, the religious people would not choose cremation," Mr. Marquez said. "Today everybody does it. It is cheaper. One half of them do it because they don't have the money. The other half because they want to save money."
Around 45 percent of clients are cremated today compared to 5 percent a decade ago, said Raymond Olmo, the La Paz office manager. The parlor charges $1,400 for a basic funeral and $600 for a cremation.
Five years ago, Mr. Klein said, he often worked six days a week. Now, it is sometimes four.
Indeed, Mr. Marquez said he had recently forbidden one of his two sons-in-law to buy a funeral home. "This business doesn't pay anymore," he said.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
InflationIs Still The Only Real Threat

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN 

 BODY:
THE American economy is on track to break the record set in the 1960's of 8 years and 10 months of uninterrupted growth without a recession. So before the real celebrations begin early next year, it's only fair to ask the question: What will bring the good times to an end?
You can be sure something will. For while there is no end in sight for the current expansion, which began in March 1991, and there is plenty of evidence that the American economy has entered a new era of higher productivity growth than in the 1970's and 80's, that does not mean the business cycle is dead. 
 "The mix of growth and inflation looks pretty good to us," said Kim Schoenholtz, chief economist at Salomon Smith Barney, the investment banking arm of Citigroup.
Indeed, Mr. Schoenholtz and his team at Salomon Smith Barney are convinced that the economy has plenty of life in it still. They are probably right. "But if you want to find reasons to worry," he says, "you can round up the usual suspects."
Ah, the usual suspects. The words made me think not so much of Claude Rains's great line near the end of "Casablanca," as of the 1995 movie that used the phrase as its title and made Kevin Spacey a star. And the echoes from that film are even more apt: Just as Keyser Soze, the hero-villain in "The Usual Suspects," walks away from the mayhem with a fortune, so too the American economy is likely to emerge relatively unscathed from the next downturn, whenever it comes.
Here's why: There are several clear sources of tension within the economy today. Household debt has risen to record levels, just as it did before nearly every previous recession. The current account deficit -- which requires Americans to sell off assets to pay for all the extra imports we buy -- has soared well past its old peak. Oil prices are on the upswing. And the stock market, by almost any measure, is overvalued, stirring fears that a sharp fall on Wall Street could prompt many affluent Americans, no longer so flush with their winnings, to tighten their belts.
But consider the suspects one by one.
As a rule, Americans have never stopped spending on their own merely because their debts reached what seemed like excessive levels. Yes, real consumer spending cannot continue growing at its breathless pace of over 5 percent a year. But even when consumers do take a much-needed breather, a slowdown in spending would almost certainly not be enough to bring the expansion to a halt. It is only after a recession hits and job losses rise that Americans tend to begin repairing their personal balance sheets.
The one recession sometimes attributed to a spontaneous drop in consumer spending -- the 1990-91 downturn that coincided with the buildup and fighting of the gulf war -- is more logically blamed on the sudden shock of higher oil prices on top of the Federal Reserve's earlier efforts, at the end of the 1980's, to reverse a buildup of inflation.
Speaking of oil prices, they played a starring role in the recession of 1973-74 (Arab oil embargo), the extended downturn at the beginning of the 1980's (Iranian revolution) and at the time of the gulf war. But each time oil prices took off, they also prompted or helped perpetuate a broader wage-price spiral, forcing the Fed to react by sharply raising interest rates to control inflation. There is no sign in the markets that the latest jump in oil prices, to around $27 a barrel, will have a similarly broad effect.
And even if higher oil prices, combined perhaps with a drop in the value of the dollar from worries over the big deficits with America's trading partners, caused a flurry of inflation fears, the Fed could probably dampen them with only a modest further tightening of the monetary spigot.
OF the handful of usual suspects, then, only one, a stock market collapse, probably can spread enough fear to cause a recession by itself. That's clearly worth worrying about -- but remember October 1987 (or October 1998, for that matter) vs. October 1929. The Fed does.
Policy makers have a clear script to follow in response to panic on Wall Street: flood the markets with cash and bring interest rates down quickly. That may create problems later on, but such moves would certainly limit any damage to the real economy from the financial turmoil.
So for all these other worries, the real risk to the economy remains the traditional bad guy: price inflation driven by wage gains well in excess of productivity improvements. "The danger," says Robert DiClemente, who watches the American economy for Salomon Smith Barney, "is that success breeds excess."
Inflation, like Franco, is still dead. But just as in "The Usual Suspects," the least likely suspect could turn out to be the murderer in the end.
"Keaton once said, 'I don't believe in God, but I'm afraid of him,' " Kevin Spacey's character, Verbal Kint, tells the agents investigating the crime. "Well, I believe in God, and the only thing that scares me is Keyser Soze."
The only thing that should scare us these days is the threat of inflation. Allowed to escape, inflation could kill our remarkably healthy economy just as it is beginning to help those long left out of America's rising prosperity. Fortunately, the villain -- at least for now -- is safely locked away.

HEADLINE: For Harlem, More to a Boom Than Shopping Centers

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
IT was no ordinary night on 122nd Street. The crowd of about 100 people pressed into the carved cherrywood corners of Martha Chandler Dolly's historic brownstone, turned out in an assortment of little black dresses, tiny spectacles and wildly coifed dreadlocks.
A troupe of models wearing battle-weary expressions stepped Kabuki-like through the house, displaying the fall and spring collections of Epperson, a SoHo fashion designer. 
 But even with its strictly-below-14th-Street airs, this was a uniquely Harlem event. Where else would Epperson's subtly Afrocentric designs (which sometimes adorn Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu) be set against a lavishly detailed, turn-of-the-century brownstone? Where else would fashion designers mingle with politicians, and artists stand toe-to-toe with businessmen, with barely a smirk between them?
"It's really eclectic," said James R. Reynolds, an artist and teacher, who sings in the choir at the Abyssinian Baptist Church but admits to drifting southward most nights for socializing. "When I go to parties downtown, you don't have as much of a mixture of people, beyond color."
The eclecticism was cultivated by Lenn Shebar and Larry Ortiz, who organized the event, part of a recently established series of cocktail parties known as the Harlem Affair. The party, on Nov. 6, was the second in the series (a third, by invitation only, is scheduled for February), designed as a kind of homage to the literary and artistic salons of the Harlem Renaissance.
Mr. Shebar, 35, a public relations and political consultant, and Mr. Ortiz, 29, a retail specialist and fashion consultant, served as the hosts of the evening, with the help of Nikoa Evans, 30, the director for business investments of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, a development corporation created by the federal government in 1994 to promote economic revitalization, and Andrew A. Babb, 30, an editorial assistant for Martha Stewart Weddings magazine.
"We consider ourselves to be love children of the Harlem Renaissance," Mr. Ortiz said, noting that he and Mr. Shebar were born and raised in Harlem, and live there now. "We love poetry and we love the arts, and that's what we want to bring back to Harlem."
Because Harlem is experiencing an economic boom, with retail complexes opening throughout the area, now is the time, Mr. Ortiz and Mr. Shebar said, to tap the neighborhood's cultural heritage and to add an artistic component to what is being called the Second Renaissance. Hoping to bring together artists of various disciplines, they asked Epperson to showcase his fashions and also invited Mr. Reynolds to exhibit his work, black-and-white portraits of family and friends, in Ms. Dolly's home.
The hosts clearly chose the setting, bordering Marcus Garvey Park in the Mount Morris Historic District, to conjure the feel of Harlem's heyday. Ms. Dolly's brownstone, completed in 1889 by William B. Tuthill, the architect for Carnegie Hall, was designed as the home of a New York developer, William A. Martin.
It was the widest and one of the most lovingly decorated row houses on the block, featuring Tiffany stained-glass windows, intricate parquet floors of oak and mahogany, and fireplaces in almost every room. (It will be profiled in a planned PBS documentary about Harlem.)
Michael Henry Adams, a neighborhood historian and preservationist, leaned on an ivory-handled cane while recounting the home's history. Mr. Adams, a friend of Ms. Dolly's, created elaborate flower arrangements for the party, with white roses, orchids and tulips. Such touches, Mr. Shebar said, help "raise the bar on expectations."
"So often, Harlem is associated with social services and as a village that's in need," he said. "But this is identifying another aspect of Harlem: that there are people here who entertain on the same social level as anyone on Park Avenue."
As much as the event was a gathering of artists, it might just as easily have been promoted as a networking opportunity for the city's black elite. "I've met several people of caliber here tonight," said Jackie Rowe-Adams, 51, a member of central Harlem's community and school boards. "District leaders, actors, models, some entrepreneurs. I think you're seeing the beginning of the rising stars of the neighborhood's leadership."
Before the fashion show, Epperson, who uses only his last name professionally, and his wife and partner, Lisha Gh'Rael Epperson, waited near the grand piano in Ms. Dolly's furnished basement. Their studio is on Thompson Street in SoHo, but they have both lived in Harlem and said they wanted to use the Harlem Affair as a way to promote their work for a new audience. "We haven't had a presence in Harlem," Mrs. Epperson said. "It's really transcultural work, it's not really downtown or uptown."
Princess Jenkins, an image consultant and an owner of the Brownstone, a retail shop on Fifth Avenue near 125th Street, sat on an antique velvet sofa in the living room under a painting by Mr. Reynolds. She said the event was the perfect way to promote new designs for black consumers, because "this is who you would want in a room." She added, "These are the people who would see it, recognize it, and take it to the right audience."
She saw advantages for Harlem, too. "Any event like this that brings important style to this community is going to be key, because Harlem has not been known for fashion and cutting-edge work," she said. "We want some more high-end style uptown. We want some SoHo uptown."

Some Rejoice, Some Mourn as Store Sites Change Hands

BYLINE: By RICHARD WEIR 

 BODY:
The sun-yellowed newspapers that blanket the windows of the long-empty Woolworth's on Roosevelt Avenue may soon give way to displays for Old Navy, the national clothing chain.
Based in San Francisco, Old Navy announced last week that it planned to open a 54,000-square-foot corner store on Roosevelt Avenue and Main Street, in downtown Flushing, by spring 2001. The news thrilled many local merchants. "It's good to have some new blood," said Richard Gelman, the owner of a local bank and co-president of the Flushing Chamber of Commerce and Business Association. 
 But in another part of the borough, community groups were wringing their hands over development plans for the soon-to-be-vacated Stern's department store on Queens Boulevard, one block northwest of the Queens Center Mall in Elmhurst.
Last month Federated Department Stores, which owns the Stern's chain, said it planned to close the 346,000-square-foot store in February. Stern's has occupied the site ever since Macy's relocated to the mall in 1995.
Federated has hired a developer, Forest City Ratner, to revamp the round concrete structure, which has a distinctive fortresslike appearance. The company intends to build another level of retail space; that space and the existing retail area will be occupied by various national retailers, including a Target store. At the top of the building, Federated will put a 12- to 14-screen Regal cinema, raising the structure's height to 112 feet.
Opponents of the project have argued that the new development will bring more cars to the neighborhood and for more hours of the day, since the theater will stay open later than Stern's has.
"This area is already one of the most congested and most dangerous areas in all of New York City," said Tony Moreno, a member of Community Board 4.
Rose Rothschild, district manager for the community board, noted that another developer was planning to build a Sony multiplex on a municipal parking field next to the Queens Center Mall.
"Do we need 32 screens for 7,000 people in the span of three blocks?" she asked.
But Joyce Baumgarten, a spokeswoman for Forest City Ratner, said the company had conducted traffic studies for the project and submitted the results to the city's Planning Department. So far, she said, the city had not asked Forest City Ratner to make any changes in the traffic projections.
As for a glut of movie screens, Ms. Baumgarten replied: "The movie operators did their own marketing surveys. Obviously, they determined that this is an area they feel is underscreened."
But back in downtown Flushing, Old Navy's announcement that it had signed a lease with Empire Associates Realty of Manhattan, the owner of the former Woolworth's building, relieved the people who worried that two shuttered department stores on the same block would damage the area's economic vitality.
Adjacent to the two-story building that Woolworth's vacated in early 1998 is a Caldor's, which has also been vacant for many months.
"Everyone was concerned," said Marilyn Bitterman, district manager of Community Board 7. "It's a prime piece of real estate right in the middle of downtown Flushing. They did not want the sites to be vacant."

HEADLINE: GRASS-ROOTS BUSINESS;
OfDolls and Online Dollars

BYLINE: By JOEL KOTKIN; Joel Kotkin is a senior fellow at the Pepperdine Institute for Public Policy. His column on the Main Street economy appears the fourth Sunday of each month. E-mail: grassrts@nytimes.com

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
TWENTY-NINE, single and childless, Dmitri Gurevich may seem an odd man to be plotting an assault on the fantasy life of young girls.
But soon, his Web design studio in this city's thriving "cyberdistrict,"on the South Side, will roll out a new Internet-based service that he hopes will transform the way that girls play with -- and buy -- dolls. 
 The new Web site, called iDolls, lets girls design their dolls from scratch, choosing facial features, clothes and accessories in any of 69 billion possible combinations. Paid for with a parent's credit card, an ordered doll is manufactured to specifications in China and shipped to the customer within two weeks.
"This is the beginning of an attempt to create a whole new set of options for girls," said Mr. Gurevich, who immigrated from Russia in 1990 and founded his company, Double Decker Studios, three years later. "This is not a set piece. This is a revolutionary thing."
Although not the first doll Web site, iDolls is a mold-breaker, using technology to overturn conventional marketing notions in the industry. Mike Collins, president of iDolls, noted that dollmakers like Mattel have spent millions of dollars developing and promoting specific doll characters like the Barbie and Friends line or the American Girl historical figures made by the Pleasant Company, a Mattel subsidiary in Middleton, Wis.
Mr. Collins contended that iDolls' approach, with its huge range of possible designs and no set characters, represents "the future of doll play."
This notion of giving power to young shoppers is the latest trend in an increasingly expensive and sophisticated drive to tap a market that is growing in numbers and buying potential: girls 8 to 12 years old.
These girls have emerged as a prime target for companies from camera makers to entertainment conglomerates. Their impact is visible in the strong ratings of television shows like "Buffy, the Vampire Slayer," and they are credited with much of the success of films like "Titanic" and "Mulan" and pop groups like the Spice Girls, 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys.
The 8-to-12 group of girls, now numbering more than 15 million nationwide, is also having more impact at the shopping mall. Retail chains like Limited Too have sprung up specifically to address the $5 billion-a-year market in preadolescent girls' clothing. And mainstream cosmetics marketers like Bath & Body Works (owned by Intimate Apparel Inc.), Avon and Estee Lauder have introduced lipstick, blush and accessory brands for girls.
Perhaps the most impressive brick-and-mortar expression of niche marketing to girls may be the Pleasant Company's American Girl Place, a 35,000-square-foot retail outlet in downtown Chicago. The sprawling emporium of dolls and girls' clothing opened a year ago and features a tea room, live entertainment and elaborate displays about the historical characters upon whom the Pleasant Company bases its dolls.
In its first year, American Girl Place counted more than 750,000 visitors; the store has become a tourist destination.
LOOKING ahead, the real action for dollmakers seems to be in cyberspace, where, perhaps surprisingly, preteenage girls appear to outnumber preteenage boys. Two-thirds of girls in the 8 to 12 group have access to a computer, compared with only 58 percent of boys, according to surveys by the Zandl Group, a New York market research firm.
And girls seem to use the computer differently, according to Irma Zandl, one of the firm's principals: they generally prefer to treat it as a communication device or a way to exercise their imaginations, rather than as a platform for playing competitive or shoot-'em-up games, the preferred mode for boys of similar ages.
"They like designing things," Ms. Zandl said. "They are checking out looks and outfits -- like playing with dolls in a more sophisticated and contemporary way."
Mr. Collins of iDolls said he believes these characteristics will give his company's business model an online edge over vendors like the Pleasant Company, where he worked until Mattel acquired it in 1995. Companies like Mattel are stuck in the past, he said, selling girls a story of a 1980's vintage, while Barbie herself reflects "an essentially 50's image of girls."
MATTEL doesn't see it that way, of course, and its quintessential California-girl flagship product is putting up a fight in cyberspace. Despite Mattel's well-publicized financial woes -- its stock price has fallen by more than half in the last two years -- the company has maintained a strong hold on computer software for girls, with Barbie-related CD-ROM's accounting for 6 of the 10 best-selling titles last year. Its year-old Barbie.Com Web site, which features a "my design" program that allows some customization of Barbie dolls, averages more than a million hits a month.
"This brand is very vital," said Adrian Fontenella, president of Mattel's Barbie Girls division. Noting that the Barbie brand continues to bring in about $1.5 billion in annual sales, or roughly 30 percent of Mattel's total revenue, Mr. Fontenella dismissed the suggestion that Barbie was outdated: "People like to advertise a perception about our being old, but reality tells you something different."
Ultimately, the fate of the dollmakers is in the hands of the young shoppers themselves. Laurie Meyer, 27, a Web page designer brought to Double Decker by Mr. Gurevich to give the iDolls site a feminine feel, thinks the power of computer technology will make girls impatient to exercise control and make choices far beyond what even the most flexible traditional dollmaker can offer.
"When I was that little, nothing like that existed," Ms. Meyer said of iDolls. "This has opened a whole realm of activity" for preteenage girls, she added. "It creates a new world of imaginary play. You can design them -- and you can own them. It opens all kinds of doors."

HEADLINE: Is the Sun Setting on Farmers?

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: DEKALB, Ill.

 BODY:
BEFORE the fall harvest was over, Vince Faivre was surveying row after row of soybeans and counting his losses.
Neither the best technology nor the promise of a bumper crop seemed to matter. For the second consecutive year, he expected to lose money, as much as $60 an acre. 
 And his thoughts ran to three things that are hardly good for the independent farmer: the growing public concern about bio-engineered crops, a spate of huge agricultural mergers and commodity prices that had plummeted to their lowest levels in nearly 30 years.
"There's just no profit in farming anymore," said Mr. Faivre, (pronounced FAY-ver) 39, as he stepped out of the cab of his combine on his 700-acre spread about 60 miles west of Chicago. "A year ago, I would have said we've been through these valleys before, but it's a much gloomier picture right now."
While the government has kept many farmers afloat with emergency aid, which the Agriculture Department says could reach $22 billion this year, net farm income has fallen more than 38 percent since 1997.
Indeed, agricultural experts say these are hard times for farmers. "Prices are as low as they have been in decades," said Keith Collins, chief economist at the Agriculture Department.
With a new array of scientific and technological processes lifting crop yields and tailoring food products to individual companies and specific markets, farmers are producing more food on fewer acres in less time. And therein lies both the promise and the perils for the independent farmer.
The nation's largest farms -- those with more than $250,000 in sales -- now account for more than 72 percent of all agricultural sales, up from 53 percent a decade ago. And after the elimination last year of many government regulations on production, farmers are being subjected to market forces they have not faced since before the New Deal.
Many farmers are worried about being squeezed by giant agricultural companies. "There's a fear this will turn into 14th-century feudalism," Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. "Those farmers will become serfs. We're not there yet, but it may be coming."
Among farmers' worries is whether to plant seeds that have been bio-engineered to ward off pests. Bio-engineering has been hailed as a godsend to farmers looking for higher crop yields, but it also faces growing opposition. Although genetically modified seeds have been approved by federal regulators and were planted on more than 70 million acres of farmland in the United States in 1999, critics have repeatedly and volubly questioned whether genetically modified crops are safe for consumption and the environment.
"The issue for many farmers is not just about the current financial situation and their income," said Michael Boehlje, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Ind. "In the back of their minds, there's a set of concerns about the long term. They want to know how they are going to participate in the new agriculture."
BUT the new agriculture involves far more than bio-engineering. Farmers have complained periodically that big corporations have gained dominance and unfair bargaining power, and now a host of economists, regulators and lawmakers are taking up the farmers' cause, arguing that the Darwinian pace has quickened.
Though some economists caution that the downturn may be causing American farmers to search for scapegoats, a growing number of economists, regulators and lawmakers are worried about the shifting balance of power that favors a handful of agricultural giants over a shrinking number of independent farmers, confused and bedeviled by all the changes.
On the Iowa plains, the new economics of agriculture is a hardship on farmers like John Whitaker, 43, who is struggling to make his mortgage payments. To support their three children, his wife, Lorrie, has taken a job, and he also works in county government and as president of the Iowa Farmers Union.
"I'm looking for anything out there that will make money," said Mr. Whitaker, who has a 500-acre farm in Hillsboro, where he raises cattle and sheep and grows corn, wheat and soybeans.
Here in De Kalb, the declining prospects mean that Mr. Faivre is relying more heavily on what his wife, Jerilyn, earns as a cook at a local university. There will not be a new John Deere combine for next year's harvest. And the Faivres will not be replacing their 1989 Dodge Caravan, which has already logged 186,000 miles.
After nearly 20 years of farming on his own, Mr. Faivre is having new doubts about how the independent farmer can survive. "Not many people are coming into this business," Mr. Faivre said. "I can only think of a handful of farmers who are younger than myself."
In some ways, agricultural experts say, Mr. Faivre represents a dying breed, as many small farmers are trading in the gloom and doom down on the farm for the booming economy that has sprouted just beyond its borders.
There is no reliable data on the number of people who have left farming in the last few years, but agricultural officials see a growing body of anecdotal evidence suggesting that many are retiring early, cashing in what equity they have or simply selling their farmland into a booming housing market and looking elsewhere for work.
Of course, agriculture has been undergoing big changes for decades. Farms have grown bigger and bigger, swallowing many small operations, and huge agricultural business conglomerates have emerged. In the last two years, however, mergers in the agricultural industry have resulted in such huge companies that the nation's largest farm groups are warning that the dwindling competition among suppliers will doom the family farm.
Most of the nation's seed supply has been consolidated into two giant camps, one controlled by Monsanto and the other by DuPont, which recently acquired Pioneer Hi-Bred International, the nation's largest seed company. Together, they control 80 percent of the nation's corn seeds and are planning to alter more of their products genetically.
Two of the world's largest grain handlers, Cargill and Continental Grain, merged their grain operations this year. The hog industry has also consolidated. Smithfield Foods, the nation's largest pork producer, agreed last September to acquire Murphy Family Farms, the second-biggest producer, and the pork unit of Tyson Foods, the No. 5 producer.
The concentration is staggering. More than a fifth of the nation's pork is now slaughtered at one company. Four big companies now control about 70 percent of all cattle slaughter, up from 39 percent in 1985, according to the government.
Not everyone is alarmed. George L. Priest, who specializes in antitrust issues as a law professor at Yale University, says the mergers are creating greater efficiencies in the market. "There have been tremendous concentrations in agriculture since World War II," Mr. Priest said. "But it's a sign there are economies of scale. The basic consumer will benefit, but it will be tough on farmers who may have to go into a different line of work."
THE industry giants also dispute the notion that big agriculture translates into bad agriculture or the end of the family farm.
Cargill says a desire for efficiency is behind its own deal. "In the grain business there is enormous pressure for efficiency," said Lori Johnson, a spokeswoman for the company in Minneapolis. "In Continental, we knew we could reduce our costs, which would lower the cost to the final consumer and put some money in the hands of the farmer."
Still, farmers complain that whether they are buying seeds, shopping for new farm machinery or moving grain to market, they are being forced to bargain with just a handful of companies.
Mr. Glickman of the Agriculture Department said a "giant shadow" looms over the family farm, making it more difficult for the independent farmer to get a fair shake.
Farmers like Mr. Faivre face the most difficult period since the 1980's, when American agriculture went into a long, steep decline. Although farmers now benefit from low interest rates, grain prices are disastrously low. Corn prices, for example, are $1.85 a bushel now, down from $2.40 two years ago. Even farmers awaiting relief from an $8.7 billion emergency aid package approved last month by Congress and President Clinton say they are considering new occupations.
Federal officials are also taking notice. The Agriculture and Justice departments say they are looking into whether the agriculture market is too heavily concentrated, and therefore anticompetitive.
Senator Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat, has asked the Justice Department to give the "most stringent scrutiny" to Smithfield's proposed acquisition of Tyson's pork division.
"What's happening with our pork farmers is that they have fewer and fewer places to go with their hogs," Mr. Harkin said in an interview.
When it comes to genetically modified seeds, Mr. Faivre, for one, says he has new doubts about whether he should be planting them. Because of growing opposition to modified crops in Europe and Asia, and rising domestic concerns, he is already trimming back his acreage for next year.
Although genetically modified plants have been approved as safe by the government, some scientists and environmental groups say they can harm certain species like monarch butterflies or create superweeds that could not be killed easily.
Jane Rissler, a scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington, said: "This is a very powerful technology that is able to produce combinations of genes that have never been produced before. And it's far from clear what the impact will be on the environment and on humans who consume them. There have been studies that indicate their potential environmental problems."
The leading makers of bio-engineered foods have vigorously defended their safety, deriding as "hysteria" the campaign against them, which has labeled bio-engineered crops as "Frankenstein food." But with the public's confidence waning, biotechnology companies are being put on the defensive.
"There is a concerted attack on the entire industry," said Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group based in Washington.
Farmers who have been planting genetically modified seeds, meanwhile, have begun wondering whether they are worth the trouble. Because some modified foods have not been approved for export and may be unwelcome in Europe and even at home, many farmers say they may cut back their acreage.
"Farmers just can't take the risk that the crops they plant in the spring won't be marketable in the fall," said Gary Goldberg, head of the American Corn Growers Association. He is not against modified foods, he said, "but our concern is that as long as there's uncertainty, we have to protect our members."
Mr. Faivre is reducing his modified-soybean acreage to 50 percent from 70 percent and is dropping modified corn. "I've totally ruled out going with genetically modified corn," he said. "I'm not going to separate it and go through all the hoops and hassles. It's just too much."
Mr. Faivre, who has four young children, says his situation is dire. He just sold 15,000 bushels of corn for $1.80 a bushel; he is holding the rest in storage, hoping that prices rally.
Most everyone in his region is suffering. Average net farm income in Illinois in 1998 slumped to about $11,074 from $62,000 in 1996, according to the Illinois Farm Bureau.
The cost of farming, meanwhile, has risen 12 percent in four years. In Iowa, Mr. Whitaker says he spends about $35 an acre on seed, $116 on fertilizers, herbicides and other chemicals and fuels and $50 on interest, depreciation and repair on his farm equipment -- a total of more than $200 an acre. He is losing $60 to $70 an acre.
Hoping that the market will take a turn for the better, Mr. Faivre is holding on to his 1979 John Deere combine that broke down repeatedly during the harvest.
"You can only tighten your belt so much," he said. "You can only live off your depreciation so long."
One of Mr. Faivre's neighbors, Joseph White, 44, says his chief worry is prices. He is also cutting back on modified crops and worrying about consolidation. "What we fear is the inability of farmers to make management decisions," says Mr. White, who grows corn and soybeans on about 950 acres in Kaneville, Ill., about 10 miles east of De Kalb. "You worry about companies telling you if you're going to put in ABC seedcorn, you're going to use DEF herbicide."
The more immediate concern for farmers, however, is depressed prices, even in the face of vastly improved efficiency. More precise farm machinery, pest-resistant crops and generally favorable weather patterns have helped triple many crop yields in the last quarter-century. Last year, a record 2.8 billion bushels of soybeans were harvested in this country, more than triple the level of the early 1970's.
"We're mapping our fields with satellites, we're harvesting four and five times as many acres per day without much more fuel," said Lynn Jensen, president of the National Corn Growers Association.
Even so, farmers are losing ground on prices. They have complained about the Freedom to Farm Act, which went into effect in 1996, and ended production restraints.
"Some believe it's the reason for the low prices," said John Lawrence, a professor of agricultural economics at Iowa State University in Ames. "Under the old system, the government would set aside land, but now farmers can plant whatever they want. So there are now 12 million new acres of soybeans."
BUT with grain prices in a slump, Mr. Faivre says that to some extent, he has given in to big agriculture. He is becoming a contract farmer for a corporation, getting additional income from a hog operation he built a few years ago. He contracted to house and feed the hogs, not own them.
"Basically, it's a pig motel for me," he says, wiping his brow. "We get them at 50 pounds and they leave at 250 pounds. The pigs are in an automated system that feeds them. That's the way things operate nowadays."

HEADLINE: The World;
A Middle East Choice: Peace or Democracy

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IN the last several months, even as a final peace between Israel and the Palestinians has come to seem more plausible, a new element of uncertainty has been creeping into the Middle East. The static pantheon of Arab leaders is beginning to crumble, and generational change has started to sweep through the region as aging and entrenched leaders give way to sons or designate heirs. So these are anxious times, as iron men begin to fade and courtiers plot their futures. Within five years, say experts on the region, the current lineup of Arab leaders is likely to be totally transformed.
And so a new question has entered the calculations of those who plan for peace or war in the region: Would democracies or dictatorships make the best neighbors and partners in the emerging peace with Israel? 
 In the West, it is common to assume that the answer is simple: democracies. But the Arab Middle East is a vast area where Western-style democracy exists only in its infancy, if at all. Its countries are riven with tribal, religious and ethnic fault lines, and in many places extremes of wealth and poverty have left the mass of people young, ill-educated and disaffected.
So it is not a simple question whether opening the floodgates to free expression of the tensions in these societies would provide the quickest way to regional peace. These are places where anti-Israeli sentiment is sometimes a passionate rallying cry for all kinds of opposition groups, and where a monarch or dictator can take a lead that a president who depends on consensus might not. On the other hand, any regime maintained through repression risks, over the years, lapsing into tyranny and instability, which are among the worst long-run risks to peace.
So the question of how to think about balancing the goals of democracy and peace is increasingly being wrestled with in Washington as well as in Israel -- a democracy itself, but one that has long made deals with whatever regimes would accept it, even as it pointed out the absence of democracy in its neighbors.
"The region is coming to the end of the postwar era, where countries were ruled by a king or a military personality," said Stephen P. Cohen, vice president of the center for Middle East Studies in New York. But as the era ends, the style of rule is unlikely to evolve much, he said. "We're in a very sensitive time concerning the self image of the Arab world. The idea that the fundamentalist threat can only be controlled by hard military rulers prevails."
One common thread runs through the process: the new leaders are likely to emerge for reasons of bloodline rather than merit, and it gives some analysts pause, no matter how pro-Western or pro-peace these leaders are.
"These people are not being chosen for competence in modern society but for loyalty and kinship," said Lisa Anderson, the dean of the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. "There is not a layer of technocrats who appear to be poised to take the reins of power."
The two countries where change has occurred this year -- Jordan and Morocco -- are monarchies that managed smooth transitions: King Abdullah succeeded his father, King Hussein of Jordan, and Mohammed VI succeeded his father, King Hassan of Morocco. Both sons are in their 30's and have experienced life in Western democracies: King Abdullah in Britain and America, King Mohammed in France.
BOTH of their fathers were partners of Israel in making peace, and the sons both see the need for economic reform to alleviate poverty. So they may turn out to be the most open and forward leaning of the new rulers in the region. Jordan, notably, has an active parliament and its new king sees the peace with Israel as a linchpin for his country's future.
In Syria, by contrast, the dynastic impulse in a tightly run dictatorship is literally impeding peace. President Hafez al-Assad is so busy organizing the succession of his son Bashar, who faces challenges from other pretenders, that he has put any negotiations for peace with Israel on hold. And a driving motivation for the Israeli Prime Minister, Ehud Barak, as he negotiates on final status issues with Yasir Arafat is the belief that the ailing Palestinian leader may well be a more reliable partner than anyone who might succeed him.
For Israel, the most immediate question is what will happen in Syria, where Mr. Assad, who is from the minority Alawite tribe, has fashioned the army, the Ba'ath party and other institutions around fealty to him. Now 69, Mr. Assad is reported to be suffering from memory loss. He looks haggard and is no longer able to sustain the marathon negotiating sessions of the past, a recent American visitor said.
Mr. Assad has also resisted reform, and this will not help his successor establish a peaceful transition. "Assad knows if he opens the door, the wind will carry him off," said Fouad Ajami, a scholar of the region. "He doesn't want to be the Gorbachev of Syria. I don't know if he can hold it together."
For two decades now, Egypt has played a pivotal position in the Middle East's peacemaking, and Americans often identify with it as if it were a like-minded democracy. In reality, despite the trappings of elections and a parliament, the system is tightly controlled by one party and the military; corruption is endemic, as is tension over Islamic activism and the repression of it. A new class of businessmen has emerged in recent years, providing an elite interested in keeping the peace with Israel. But it is not much interested in basic reforms, preferring to use state and crony contacts to maintain its income, experts here say.
RECENTLY, President Hosni Mubarak, who is 71, declared that his son Gamal, a banker, would not succeed him, drawing a distinction between Egypt and its neighbors. But that doesn't mean a democratic succession. Mr. Ajami thinks the army will designate a successor if Mr. Mubarak dies in office, which has become the standard way of giving up power in Egypt.
Ms. Anderson gives credit to Israeli leaders for placing value on democracy as they think about their neighbors' futures, even as they recognize that Israel is probably the last country that could promote democracy in them. "The Israelis are quite aware of the dilemma they are in," she said. "They think democracy is a good thing but if they make it known, they run the risk of being a political football in the domestic politics of these countries. So there is a temptation to say: 'Let's sign on with this person, even if he's unpopular at home.' "

HEADLINE: The World: Big Blur;
Meet Your Government, Inc.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THEY are pouring into Seattle this weekend in vans and on buses, by air and on foot -- the college students and the church groups, the environmental campaigners, the Teamsters, Ralph Nader, Chinese dissidents and the man who became a hero in France for defacing a McDonald's.
All of them say they are outraged at the growing power of a group few even heard about five years ago, the World Trade Organization. And so, with tens of thousands massing, they are planning to turn what initially sounded like the yawner of all international meetings -- a gathering of trade ministers from 135 countries to start the "Millennium Round" of trade liberalization talks -- into the Woodstock of the era of globalization. 
 But of course the W.T.O. itself, with its paltry annual budget of $80 million, not even enough to buy a fleet of black helicopters, isn't the real target of the protesters. It's merely a symbol, a bureaucratic metaphor for the idea that the markets have become the real governing force of the '90's -- frequently with the willing participation of governments and politicians.
The real target is the blurring of the role of the private sector and the role of the public sector, which is supposed to rein in of market forces. For a ready example, think of those so-called non-commercials on public TV that, with each passing year, seem to turn into longer and longer plugs for corporate sponsors.
It is not simply that governments have shrunk and the private sector has risen. In fact, the public sector has increasingly become the champion of private enterprise. That reflects a sea change in traditional political constituencies. The parties that used to get elected by arguing that government must tame capitalism's excesses and stand up for those left behind -- big-government Democrats, Europe's battered Socialists -- have mostly retooled themselves and changed the priorities of governments, aligning them more closely than ever with those of corporations and their swelling class of worker-investors.
Not surprisingly, the shift has created a lot of political confusion about whose interests are being protected. Consider the union members in Seattle. True, the forces of global trade are threatening to move their jobs to China. But like many workers across America, the union members have huge pension funds and 401-K's spiking upward precisely because they are invested in companies and countries that have benefited greatly from ever-freer trade.
"It used to be that trade only affected major corporations," Mickey Kantor, the former Trade Representative and long-time Democratic political strategist, said last week. "Now it affects people's jobs, their education and of course their portfolios. And it creates some pretty wacky politics."
The degree to which left and right have unified to become the champion of corporate priorities was on full display in the Congressional session that just ended. Democrats and Republicans may be in a death-battle for control of the White House and Congress, but they managed to find common ground on repealing Depression-era laws preventing banks, securities firms and insurance concerns from merging those businesses (while doing nothing about those $1.50 ATM fees that drive most banking customers crazy) and passing a law limiting lawsuits arising out of Y2K disasters.
And look at the legislation that business got killed: There was no increase in the minimum wage, no new limits on "soft money" in political campaigns, no ban on agricultural mergers.
Or look abroad: The generals who staged the coup in Pakistan made their first priority a crackdown on corruption. The country's terrible reputation among foreign investors, they warned, was as big a threat to the nation as India's nukes.
This is not to say governments have entirely given up on reining in market forces. Japan is focusing its attentions at Seattle on retaining protections for farmers, steelmakers and industrial dinosaurs. France is forever battling the spread of American-dominated industry and culture. Here at home, even the market-friendly new Democrats of the Clinton administration have breathed new life into anti-trust laws.
Drive a few miles north of the W.T.O. meeting in Seattle, and Microsoft employees will offer up an earful about how the Justice Department is mired in old economic thinking, and is threatening the economic engine that has driven one of the greatest expansions in American history.
But even those protests are muted by the not-so-secret belief among Microsoft's investors that a breakup of the company might turn into a bonanza for their shareholdings -- exactly what happened after the government went after A.T.&T.
So is the public good suffering as the role of government and the role of business blur? It depends on what you think governments ought to be doing for a living.
Those promotional spots for sponsors on public television have expanded precisely because there is increasing opposition to using taxpayer money to fund TV or the arts. So now the P in PBS now stands for something more like "public-private partnership," and it seems likely that public financing will play an ever smaller role.
And of course the most sacrosanct of public functions -- education -- is a constant battleground in the public-private wars. School vouchers, charter schools and for-profit educational companies that run schools all blur the line between what governments can achieve and what the private sector can.
In each of these cases, good civic and economic arguments can be made for more private financing. But with the loss of public money inevitably comes a loss of public control, and less of a voice for public debate over priorities.
AND that, at the heart of it, is the argument that will be shouted on the streets in Seattle. People who don't usually have much in common -- the Rainforest Action Network and the United Steelworkers, for example -- are convinced that the W.T.O.'s rise represents the ultimate victory for corporate interests that want the rules of the global economy written on their terms.
"There are enough examples on the table now, from the arguments over whether countries can ban genetically modified foods, or the argument that we can't ban products made by child labor because it violates some trade agreement," said Mr. Nader, the longtime consumer advocate who years ago moved beyond auto safety to make the case that a global economic rule-setter like the W.T.O. is unsafe at any speed. "People aren't buying the idea anymore that globalization is inevitable and their governments have to go with the flow of the market. That's what is unifying the protesters you are going to see."
THE fight over genetically modified food is a prime example of the alliance of governments and corporations -- and the growing frictions over national standards. While American companies and regulators argue that these foods are safe, Europeans have banned many of them as threats to consumer safety and the environment. Washington responds that health is a phony argument to justify trade barriers. So far, it's winning its W.T.O. case and losing European consumers.
Or consider the explosive issue of how to handle the concerns of labor. Unions will be in Seattle to argue that global trade agreements should protect the rights of workers, just as they have long protected intellectual property and investments abroad. They want the new trade agreement to include provisions that set minimum labor standards in factories around the world. They oppose imports from countries that ban unions, China included. In an election year in which Vice President Al Gore is desperate for deeper union support, they have more than a little political leverage.
But developing nations like India and China say that such restrictions are simply a form of American protectionism. They insist that labor issues are a domestic concern unrelated to trade, and want any rulemaking relegated to the toothless International Labor Organization. The Clinton administration supported that position a few years ago, but now wants a study group within the W.T.O. to take up the issue.
To the protesters on the street, a study doesn't go far enough. To the developing nations, it's far too much. All of this has opened up the new divide of globalization, the argument over who will make the rules, and on whose behalf. "It's not going to be the W.T.O. with its closed-door, big-business policies," vows Mr. Nader. He could be right: The very fact that a W.T.O. negotiation is triggering screaming in the streets could mean that the pendulum is beginning to swing back, and that global politics may rear its head and attempt to trump the imperatives of global economics.

HEADLINE: A Turbulent Trade Meeting

 BODY:
Officials from the 135 member countries of the World Trade Organization will meet in Seattle starting Tuesday, not to solve the world's trade disputes but merely to set an agenda for the next round of negotiations. Even that will not be easy. Rich countries are squabbling with poor countries. Thousands of street demonstrators are expected to denounce the organization for trampling on the rights of third-world workers, the sovereignty of individual countries and the environment.
In such a turbulent setting, a productive agenda will almost certainly elude the assembled ministers unless they focus tightly on a few achievable measures aimed at expanding trade. The most important of these will benefit the world's poorest countries. 
 Third-world farmers want access to closed agriculture markets in Europe and Japan. This demand deserves to be met. Developing countries also want the United States to limit the use of "anti-dumping" laws. The rules governing the use of these laws deserve tightening. Unfortunately, the United States almost surely will not go along. Another proposal from third-world countries is to rewrite rules that force them to pay prohibitively high prices for pharmaceutical drugs. Here the patent rights of Western drug manufacturers must yield to common sense and decency.
Trickier than any of these issues is a proposal by the developed countries that they be allowed to impose tariffs on imports from countries that exploit unskilled workers. Poor countries believe this proposal masks a protectionist purpose. It is true that working conditions in third-world countries can be horrific, but the tariffs could eliminate the jobs of millions of workers in these countries. Rich and poor countries are nowhere near a consensus on fair labor practices, and the Clinton administration wants to set up a working group to study the issue. That makes sense.
The advanced countries also want to incorporate -- over the objections of developing countries -- environmental concerns into trade agreements. Environmental groups point with alarm to rulings by W.T.O. judicial panels that, they say, tampered with the United States' right to enforce high environmental standards. But these criticisms distort the record. W.T.O. panels did, for example, rule against specific sanctions that the United States imposed on foreign fishermen for practices that threatened dolphins and other endangered species. But the panels did not dispute America's right to set its own standards. They only insisted that American laws not discriminate against foreign suppliers.
The Clinton administration has offered some proposals that environmentalists can like. For example, it proposes to cut subsidies that governments provide for farmers and fishermen. Cutting subsidies not only improves trade patterns, but it also reduces incentives to overuse fragile land and fisheries. Environmental advocates object to an administration proposal to reduce tariffs on wood products. That, they say, would increase the demand for wood and, thereby, logging in Indonesia, Malaysia, Finland and the United States. This criticism deserves careful consideration, but on balance, the administration's general strategy -- to tackle key environmental issues case by case -- appears sound.
Lost among the disputes is the fact that open trade promotes prosperity. Economists are hard pressed to identify a single economy that prospers without a vigorous export-oriented policy. And for every exporter there needs to be a willing importer. The goal of trade talks is to guarantee that countries that want to export can find countries willing to import -- a goal that can start to be met if the trade ministers drop proposals that cannot yet be resolved by consensus and focus on the few that can.

Trump Shrugged

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD 

 BODY:
Greed is good, again.
Gordon Gekko's "Wall Street" homily and Ayn Rand's paeans to selfishness are the manifestoes of our giddy materialism. 
 As a young capitalist in Ms. Rand's novel "Atlas Shrugged" explained: "When I die, I hope to go to heaven. . . . So I want to be prepared to claim the greatest virtue of all -- that I was a man who made money."
Now it's not only Wall Street that is go-going; it's Main Street. Everybody wants to spin that wheel and make a mil -- on TV, on the Internet, on stocks and on the playing field.
Donald Trump is talking about ponying up $100 million to run for president. So, in this season of giving some and getting more, I asked the high-rolling plutocrat, spending the holiday weekend at his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Palm Beach, for a soliloquy on the subject of greedisgood.com.
"It really is not very different than the 80's," Mr. Trump says. "In the 80's, people had limos. Now they have all-terrain vehicles, which cost more than the limos.
"There was an anti-80's feeling for a while, everyone cutting back, but now the mood is 'Let's just do it!' I just got back from a golf course I built in Florida. It costs $300,000 to join. In the 80's, there was no such thing. Rich people are handing me checks like Godiva chocolates.
"Greed is not good. The line played well in a movie. But a lot of things play well in words -- like 'All men are created equal' -- that sound magnificent and beautiful, but that doesn't necessarily make them so. Greed is the bad part of success. And people have wanted to be successful from the beginning of time.
"My entire life, I've watched politicians bragging about how poor they are, how they came from nothing, how poor their parents and grandparents were. And I said to myself, if they can stay so poor for so many generations, maybe this isn't the kind of person we want to be electing to higher office. How smart can they be? They're morons. There's a perception that voters like poverty. I don't like poverty. Usually, there's a reason for poverty. Do you want someone who gets to be president and that's literally the highest paying job he's ever had?
"You don't need money to get beautiful women. All my life, I've had friends who were successful and can't get a date, let alone a date with a beautiful woman. I have watched men worth hundreds of millions who have all the trappings -- a G-5 Gulfstream jet , the Fifth Avenue apartment, the Palm Beach estate, and they cannot get a date. They're sitting at home watching television. They're brilliant all day long and at night, they don't have a clue.
"These people who eat people alive for a living, come 7 o'clock, they see a girl who's a solid 5 -- not supermodels, 10's -- and they look at her in awe, but they develop lockjaw.
"I fixed up a very well-known powerful, rich man with a very nice and very beautiful woman he'd been trying to meet for a year and a half. She called me the following day and said, 'Don't ever do that to me again,' and an hour later he called me and said, 'It was unbelievable. Could you call her and arrange a second date?'
"Ultimately, a woman can't make love to a G-5.
"People believe there's more glamour to being a very wealthy person, but there really is a lot of work. Once, a very rich guy calls me up and asks if I can get him reservations that night for Le Cirque. He can't get in. So I got him in, and he calls the next day and says: 'You got me the best table. But how do you deal with all that publicity?' Look, what's the point of being successful if nobody knows who you are?
"This dot-com nonsense? I think a lot of it will go away. Maybe it's all a mirage. It's pretty fragile. Every single I.P.O. coming out goes through the roof. I just don't see anything tangible. I like to see and feel and touch something -- bricks, mortar.
"A friend called me up the other day and talked about investing in a dot-com that sells lobsters. Internet lobsters. Where will this end? The next day he sent me a huge package of lobsters on ice. How low can you stoop?
"Bradley would be bad for the economy. He's a Marxist. As far as he's concerned, Communism is just fine.
"When the market goes down, we'll all be cleansed and brought back to reality. If I'm president, it won't happen for a long time. If I'm not, it will happen immediately."

HEADLINE: The Pitfalls InHospitals' Cost-Cutting

 BODY:
"Bitter Pills for Ailing Hospitals" (front page, Oct. 31), by Milt Freudenheim, looked at the drastic cost-cutting measures often recommended by the Hunter Group, a consulting firm led by David Hunter. The article drew various responses from readers.
 
To the Editor:
The fundamental issue that neither the hospital administrators nor the doctors of our country have grasped is that, as deliverers of health care, they have too often abandoned their role as patients' defenders and advocates. Hospitals and doctors have systematically refused to change the way they take care of patients. 
 Instead, many favor a role that seeks to protect their own incomes and lifestyles and have relegated medical decision-making to insurance companies.
About a third of all medical procedures performed in the United States are estimated to be inappropriate; some are done when they are not needed while others are not done when they are needed. When so much money is being wasted, it is hardly the time to think of rationing medical services by decreasing needed nurses and reducing medical research in teaching hospitals.
As a result of fast changes in technology, the numbers of physicians and hospitals in some areas far exceed the needs of patients available to use their services. They should close the excess beds, replace them with modern centers for stabilizing and transferring patients, and provide patients and doctors with resources to check treatment plans.
Short-term economic fixes provided by the Hunter Group cause accessible, affordable health care to slip further from our grasp. Arbitrarily reducing hospital overhead does not deal with the fundamental problem of how and why decisions are made to use medical resources in everyday delivery of health care. Patients and doctors must make better decisions about how resources are used in order for our health system to retain its superiority and financial viability.
The information and technology for better decision-making have been available for decades. Why don't our hospitals and doctors use them?

A Rousing Week of Records Overseas

BYLINE: By MICKEY MEECE 

 BODY:
Investors in France, the Netherlands, Britain and Spain last week were like fans shouting ole at a bullfight, as they lifted stock markets in those countries to new highs.
 In the United States, the Nasdaq managed a new record during the holiday-shortened week, closing up 2 percent, at 3,447.81. The Dow Jones industrials and Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell fractionally for the week. 
 The Brazilian market, meanwhile, flirted with a record, a remarkable turnaround from 10 months ago when investors dumped stocks because of the country's currency devaluation.
 The Bovespa index of 44 most-traded stocks closed at 13,888 on Friday, off a record high of 14,007. Analysts in Brazil said money poured into stocks from bonds in response to the central bank's move to cut overnight lending rates in half.
 Marcelo Guterman, a money manager at Lloyds Bank in Sao Paulo, told Bloomberg News: People are afraid of inflation, and fixed-income investments aren't keeping up with it. Since interest rates have been falling, funds are reallocating their assets in search of higher returns. MICKEY MEECE

HEADLINE: The Real Challenge Is Inward

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Some advice to Casey and her peers: don't get too caught up in the race. It matters less than you think. I was close to the top of my class at Horace Mann in 1982, but not close enough to get into one of the top Ivies. Most of my friends had lower averages and did not even try. Every one of them is successful now, professionally, socially and in their family lives. As for the friends I made since college, I can't even tell you where most of them went to college. 
 Here's a little secret: regardless of where you go to college (and you will get in somewhere), getting into graduate school, even the most famous ones, is far easier than getting into college. I have seen the weakest of students go on to become doctors and lawyers. This summer a former student who had struggled in my courses came to school to work on her resume. She had just graduated from a college in the Midwest, and I pretended I recognized the name. Despite her academic challenges, she is a delightful person. Her goal was to work at a young technology company and get stock options. I gave her some advice on networking and interviewing. Not two days had passed when she came back in to declare that she had found a job. A twentysomething entrepreneur had hired her for his tech start-up.
Casey, there are thousands of colleges in the U.S. The economy is white-hot. You write like a novelist and know the right people. The only competition you need to engage in is with yourself.

HEADLINE: Suspicion Following Sun Myung Moon to Brazil

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER 

DATELINE: JARDIM, Brazil

 BODY:
As far as the eye can see, there is almost nothing here but pasture, with the distant line of the horizon broken only by tall anthills and an occasional tree. But the Rev. Sun Myung Moon envisions this remote and sparsely populated corner of Brazil as what he calls "a kingdom of heaven on earth, a new Garden of Eden."
Mr. Moon, the 78-year-old founder of the Unification Church, who has been rebuffed in the United States and is facing financial trouble in his native South Korea, is seeking to reinvent himself here in the South American heartland. 
 Through a venture he calls New Hope East Garden, Mr. Moon has bought thousands of acres of pasture land and spent some $30 million, according to the project's manager, in hope of building a spiritual and business empire here that is to include investments in agriculture, industry and tourism, as well as a university.
Such investment was at first welcomed in the neediest part of Mato Grosso do Sul, a state whose own governor describes it as a land of "2 million people and 22 million cows." But increasingly, Mr. Moon's visible presence here is generating the same sort of opposition and suspicion that has followed him elsewhere around the world during a long career as the self-proclaimed "true father" and successor to Jesus Christ.
"No one knows what he's up to out there, what are the objectives of his investments or the origins of his money," the governor, Jose Orcirio Miranda dos Santos, said in an interview. "This has become an issue of national security, and I think an investigation is needed."
Mr. Moon's initial warm reception has quickly chilled, with charges in the news media and from local church officials that the sect is involved in illegal activities. In October, local Roman Catholic and Protestant churches jointly issued an open letter accusing Mr. Moon of 10 forms of heresy, urging "the people of God to keep their distance from the Unification sect."
"More than a sect, this is a business that hides behind the facade of religion in order to make money," said Msgr. Vitorio Pavanello, the Roman Catholic bishop of Campo Grande, the state capital. "He is trying to build an empire by buying everything in sight."
But Mr. Moon's associates offer a different explanation. "It is our goal and desire to do something great for this region," said Cesar Zaduski, a former president of the Unification Church in Brazil and the general manager of the New Hope project. "Rev. Moon has a lot of companies around the world, more than 300, and his intention is to bring some of them here so that this region can get the benefit of development and first world know-how and technology."
Mr. Zaduski said that Mr. Moon was prepared to commit much more money to make the New Hope venture viable. The objective, he said, is to produce fish, exotic meats, fruit and wood for commercial markets here and abroad, and to turn this area into a leading eco-tourism center within a few years.
Mr. Moon's representatives here said that their leader first visited the region five years ago on a fishing trip and was impressed by its wide-open spaces and variety of wildlife. Since then, his movement has bought 220 square miles of farmland in Mato Grosso do Sul and a 310-square-mile parcel near Fuerte Olimpo on the Paraguayan side of the border, as well as hotels and other businesses.
Mr. Moon's big push in this largely undeveloped corner of Brazil comes as the business conglomerate he controls in South Korea has nearly collapsed. Because of the economic crisis that swept across East Asia beginning in 1996, the debt of his Tong Il Group soared to more than $1.2 billion. Five of its 17 companies were forced into receivership last year, and an automobile manufacturing project in China has also failed.
His diverse enterprises in the United States appear to be in better shape. Those include a newspaper, The Washington Times, as well as Bridgeport University in Connecticut, a recording studio and travel agency in New York, and a cable network, the Nostalgia Channel. But Mr. Moon has indicated recently that he is disenchanted with the country that has been his main base of operations since the 1970's.
"America doesn't have anywhere to go now," he said in a speech in New York last year. "The country that represents Satan's harvest is America, the kingdom of extreme individuality, of free sex."
Mr. Moon's critics say that his view is growing harsher because of the decline of his influence in the United States, where he was imprisoned for a year after being convicted of tax evasion in 1982, and where he has been the subject of embarrassing books and news reports.
While he was once believed to have about 30,000 followers in the United States, the current number of church members is believed to be about one-tenth that number.
But Mr. Zaduski said Mr. Moon's interest in South America resulted from a desire to focus on the Roman Catholic world, after emerging from a Confucian and Buddhist environment and spending a long time in a predominantly Protestant atmosphere. No place, he added, has a larger concentration of Roman Catholics than South America, in particular in the region of the customs union called Mercosur, which consists of Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia and Chile.
"What unites South America is Mercosur, and what is the heart of Mercosur?" he asked. "This region here, where you can build a project that goes beyond borders."
In recent years, Mr. Moon has been active in Uruguay, Brazil's southern neighbor -- so much so that the capital, Montevideo, is now derisively called Moontevideo by some. There, the sect has acquired the luxury Victoria Plaza Hotel, operates the newspaper Tiempos del Mundo and retains an interest in a bank, Banco de Credito, in which the government intervened last year after complaints of irregularities.
Here, Mr. Moon built up good will early on by donating ambulances to mayors, sponsoring barbecues for residents and making donations to political campaigns. He also opened a school on his New Hope property, invited local children to enroll and even offered to provide transportation from their homes. But relations are now openly hostile.
"When they first began acquiring property here, we expected that they would promote and contribute to the prosperity of our region by generating jobs and taxes," said Marcio Campos Monteiro, the mayor of Jardim, a town of 21,000 people. "But all they seem to be doing is stockpiling land, without producing anything or hiring from the local labor force."
Mr. Monteiro contends that Mr. Moon's presence here has actually hurt the economy. The sect now owns 10 percent of the county, he said, and government revenues have dropped because he has withdrawn so much land from production and the tax rolls, claiming a religious exemption.
The New Hope site includes at least 20 buildings, but has less than 200 permanent residents and many of those who work there are Korean, Japanese, American and European volunteers who rarely leave the compound and come for 40-day courses of instruction, paying their own way as well as making donations.
Civic and church groups have also begun to complain loudly, and have even charged that local youths are being recruited and sent off for indoctrination in Sao Paulo, where the sect has its Brazilian headquarters. Though local police declined to discuss the matter, there are also complaints that converts are being held against their will at New Hope.
"I recently had two young people who had run away from New Hope come in here seeking help in getting back home to Pernambuco," 1,500 miles away, said Bruno Padron, the Roman Catholic bishop here. "They focus on the poor and the needy, and once they have them in their family, they refuse to let them go."
Recent reports in the Brazilian news media have also suggested that the sect may be involved in drug trafficking and other forms of contraband smuggling across the notoriously porous border with Paraguay in order to generate revenues.
Mr. Miranda dos Santos would say only that "the federal government is looking into those questions."
Mr. Zaduski dismissed such accusations as "crazy stories" and illogical. "Rev. Moon comes here quite often, so if his people were doing something illegal, he would not want to be so close," he said. "That would be stupid, because he is a big target."
Despite the increasingly tense atmosphere here, Mr. Moon apparently plans to plunge ahead. In September, the government extended Mr. Moon's visa for two more years.
"He is really amazed by the way nature here is so pristine," Mr. Zaduski said. "He wants the entire world to understand that the heavenly father wants this treasure to be kept for all mankind, and that is why he is putting so much of his own time and guidance into this."

HEADLINE: For U.S., Bradley Favors An Internationalist Path

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 27

 BODY:
In his first major campaign event on foreign policy, former Senator Bill Bradley will use a meeting with students this Monday to cast himself as a committed internationalist who believes that America's vital interests abroad can best be advanced through the free flow of goods, capital and ideas across national boundaries, his aides said.
Mr. Bradley, who is running for the Democratic presidential nomination, will also argue in an appearance at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University that the Pentagon budget should not be increased above current levels and that military spending should be redirected toward fighting new threats, including terrorism, biological warfare and nuclear proliferation. 
 And echoing one of his longstanding criticisms of the Clinton administration, Mr. Bradley will contend that American policies toward Russia have failed to stem corruption, political instability and economic decay there. Vice President Al Gore, who is Mr. Bradley's lone Democratic rival, has played a central role in overseeing policy toward Russia.
The Bradley campaign is counting on the Fletcher School event in Boston to showcase what they consider the candidate's command of complex international issues, gained in part from serving on the Senate Intelligence Committee during 8 of his 18 years in Congress. To demonstrate his facility with those issues, Mr. Bradley plans to outline his foreign policy views through a question-and-answer session with students, instead of through a speech prepared with the help of advisers.
"He can handle any foreign policy question from anybody at any point," said Eric Hauser, Mr. Bradley's press secretary.
Mr. Bradley himself has said that he thinks many voters use foreign policy as a yardstick to measure the depth, stature and trustworthiness of presidential candidates. "I believe it is a very real way that people assess a candidate, because they ultimately are asking themselves that question: Whom do I trust with my life?" he told reporters this fall.
But the Gore campaign has already begun trying to paint Mr. Bradley as naive and inexperienced about foreign affairs, saying he lacks a clear policy vision and is inconsistent about when to use military force overseas.
For instance, the Gore campaign has criticized Mr. Bradley for voting in 1984 against sending aid to Nicaraguan rebels fighting the Sandinista government, and then reversing field and voting for it in 1986.
Mr. Bradley, one of only 11 Democratic senators to support President Reagan's aid package to the rebels, said at the time that he became convinced the measure was needed to prevent the Nicaraguan government from trying to undermine democratic states in Central America.
Though his Fletcher School appearance will be his first prominent foreign policy event of the campaign, Mr. Bradley has been gradually laying out his vision for America's role overseas during the last year. At the core of that vision is the idea that technology and trade can spread prosperity to even the poorest nations, bring greater stability to global hot spots and encourage the growth of democracy.
In a speech before an Iowa nuclear disarmament group in September, he argued that a central goal of American foreign policy should be to reduce poverty worldwide. "If we do these things, we'll be a nation that has a clearer idea that we're not only standing up for our ideals domestically, but we're also influencing the world by knitting the world into a closer whole," he said.
Properly used, Mr. Bradley has argued, the global marketplace can provide powerful incentives to governments to resolve ethnic conflicts and improve human rights. Citing the case of Indonesia, where pro-Jakarta militias terrorized civilians in East Timor earlier this year, Mr. Bradley has said that the Indonesian government should be denied financial help from the World Bank or the International Monetary Fund if it does not prosecute militia leaders who are accused of mass murder.
"A globalized economy begins to exert new pressures to do things that serve the overall interests of human rights," he said in Iowa.
At the same time, Mr. Bradley has often urged caution about using American military forces abroad to quell ethnic disputes or calm regional tensions. In the Senate, he voted against sending troops to push Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991, saying he wanted to try economic sanctions against Baghdad first. He also questioned whether it was in the country's strategic interests to deploy American forces in Bosnia. And he described American policy in Kosovo as "bomb and hope diplomacy" that could have been avoided with earlier diplomatic intervention.
"I don't think the United States has either the resources nor the will to be the policeman to the world," he has said on many occasions during the campaign.
Instead, Mr. Bradley says, America needs to increase its reliance on the United Nations to resolve regional conflicts. He says the United States should have long ago paid the $1 billion it owed to the United Nations in back dues, arguing that it lost influence within the organization.
Russia policy may provide Mr. Bradley one of his clearest contrasts with the vice president. In an op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal in September, Mr. Bradley argued that the administration had allowed strategic arms negotiations with Russia to stall, erred in pushing for NATO expansion over Russian objections and done too little to encourage economic reforms. He also asserted that the United States needed to do much more to prevent Russian nuclear weapons and weapons materials from being sold to terrorists or rogue nations, and that the Administration had become an apologist for President Boris N. Yeltsin.
Instead of relying on Mr. Yeltsin, Mr. Bradley contends, the United States should broaden its ties to other Russian political and civilian leaders, a position also advocated by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the leading Republican presidential candidate. Mr. Bradley also advocates increasing spending on a program he helped create while in the Senate that brings high school students from Russia and other former Soviet republics to study in the United States.
He also supports beginning negotiations with Russia on a Start III treaty that would require each nation to reduce its nuclear arsenal to 1,000 to 2,000 weapons. And he would push for passage of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty for nuclear weapons that Congress rejected last month.
Mr. Bradley says he would keep the Pentagon budget at current levels, in contrast to Mr. Gore, who has called for increasing spending. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war, Mr. Bradley argues that the United States no longer needs to prepare to fight wars on two fronts, and so can trim its troop levels and forgo building expensive new weapons systems like the F-22 fighter. Mr. Gore supports building the F-22.
Like the Clinton administration, Mr. Bradley supports modifying the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, signed by the United States and the Soviet Union in 1972, to allow development of a defense system to protect the United States from ballistic missile attacks.
But Mr. Bradley has expressed skepticism about a national missile defense system, calling it a "difficult and expensive proposition." He has suggested that he would prefer a more limited system that could protect American forces overseas, such as in Japan, or shoot down a few missiles launched at the United States either accidentally by a superpower or purposely by a nation like North Korea.
Also like the Clinton administration, Mr. Bradley supported bringing China into the World Trade Organization. And he supports a "one-China" policy that would peacefully and gradually unify Taiwan and China. But until unification, he says he would be willing to use American military power to protect Taiwan, provided it did not declare its independence from China.
"Essentially we are buying time" for China-Taiwan relations, he said in Iowa recently. "If there is any country that understands time, it is the Chinese."

HEADLINE: M.B.A. Boom Fades as Candidates Seek Instead the Rewards of the Internet

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
Michael Hyatt was dutifully following a traditional path for a future corporate executive. After college, he joined a consulting firm, where he advised blue-chip companies like AT&T, General Motors and I.B.M. He then applied to a few business schools, gained admission to Stanford, the most selective of them all, and prepared to enroll this fall.
During the summer, however, he took an eight-week job helping a friend who worked at a small Internet company in Southern California, and when it ended, Mr. Hyatt, 28, was hooked. So shortly before he was to sit down to his first finance class, he called Stanford to say thanks anyway: he wouldn't be showing up in Palo Alto after all. 
 "You need to do this now, before it's too late," Mr. Hyatt said of working for an Internet start-up. "If you wait two years, there's going to be consolidation in the industry. Right now, you have a chance to stake out your own claim."
As many of the nation's most talented young workers rush to stake that claim, business school has suddenly lost some of its luster. That has had a significant impact on applications to some top schools, particularly those that tend to attract the entrepreneurially minded. In the last year, applications to Stanford, M.I.T., Dartmouth, Michigan and the University of California at Berkeley, have dropped as much as 11 percent. On other elite campuses, like Northwestern and Carnegie Mellon, applications have leveled off. Some less prestigious universities have seen steep declines.
More students are also dropping out after the first year of the two-year M.B.A. program to remain with companies where they worked over the summer. And driven in part by the generally strong economy, the number of Americans taking the standardized admissions test for business school has fallen sharply in recent years.
The changes are a significant departure from the attitude toward the M.B.A. degree earlier in this long economic expansion. For the past decade, until last spring, applications increased at every elite school virtually every year, turning the M.B.A. program into one of the hottest areas of higher education.
Today, however, many potential students worry that two years is too long to be studying marketing and operations, and, unlike those aspiring to be lawyers or doctors, they do not need a degree to practice their craft. Much as William H. Gates decided in 1976 that starting a software company was more important than graduating from Harvard College, they are eager to get moving. Among the prizes they seek are the stock options available to the first employees of a start-up -- even if it means forgoing the six-figure salaries that M.B.A.'s often command.
Behind the eagerness is a broader anxiety shared by many investors and executives that the current Internet bull market could be at or very near its peak. That perception is encouraging companies to go public at a record pace to take advantage of current valuations, for example, and making stock prices gyrate.
Many people in their 20's and 30's also question whether the ivory tower is the place to learn about the emerging Internet world. "There's an urgency that this is happening so fast that you've got to be in it to really learn it," said George Daly, dean of New York University's Stern School of Business. Applications to N.Y.U. dropped slightly last spring after rising an average of 15 percent in each of the previous three years.
To attract students and recruiters, schools are overhauling curriculums to offer more Internet courses and even creating majors devoted to the subject. Some schools have increased advertising budgets and stepped up their own recruiting to compete with companies trying to lure skilled workers.
And for the first time in their histories, schools are seeing groups of students leave after their first year, perhaps abandoning the $25,000 or so investment many had made in a year of tuition. Twenty-five of the 765 members of the M.B.A. class of 2000 at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, for example, did not return this fall, and almost all now work for Internet start-ups, a spokesman for the school said.
In response, some schools are considering more liberal leave-of-absence policies, while others, including Pennsylvania and Northwestern, have dusted off little-used rules to allow students to take up to five years off. Around the country, said Donald P. Jacobs, Northwestern's dean, "people are wringing their hands" about the departures. Professor Jacobs said he expected most students to return eventually.
Though there are no statistics that offer a definitive reason for the changes, many observers said the Internet was a major culprit. More broadly, a low unemployment rate and an almost insatiable demand for high-skilled workers in corporate America has left people who would normally be pondering an M.B.A. quite happy in their current jobs.
Administrators also pointed to demographic factors, noting that the number of people in their late 20's is shrinking slightly, and added that the recent M.B.A. boom and the resulting lowered acceptance rates might be intimidating potential applicants.
Over all, the number of Americans taking the standardized business-school admission test has fallen 17 percent in the last four years, according to the Graduate Management Admission Council, which administers the test. That decline is exaggerated by the fact that the test, in its new computerized format, is no longer offered on college campuses, discouraging undergraduates from taking it. Still, top schools typically consider only applicants with at least two years of work experience, and the number of test-takers has dropped in almost every age group since 1995, according to the council.
Not every school has seen interest wane. Fueled by the six-figure salaries many graduates fetch and the continued growth in the number of foreigners who want American business degrees, applications to some schools are still rising.
Applications to Harvard, for example, rose 5 percent last year, and at Columbia, where one-third of the student body hails from other countries, they increased by almost 10 percent. Duke and the University of Chicago also saw increases.
But at top schools renowned for attracting entrepreneurs and technology experts -- like Stanford and Berkeley -- the number of applications fell or was unchanged last spring. Many people who traditionally apply to those schools now feel an urgent need to work at an Internet start-up, said Sally P. Lannin, a former Stanford administrator and currently the president of M.B.A. Strategies, a Minnesota-based consulting firm for business-school applicants. By contrast, Harvard, Columbia and Chicago -- while turning out many entrepreneurs as well -- are among the schools that aspiring investment bankers consider first.
Patty Benson, 26, is one of the nonapplicants. Like Mr. Hyatt, she had been following the usual course for ambitious people who want to work in corporate America. Ms. Benson majored in economics at Colby College in Maine, landed a plum job at Bain & Company as a consultant, and started to think about business school. Then the online explosion interrupted her thoughts.
"All these companies are growing very, very fast," Ms. Benson said. "I wanted to be in on it." So she applied to Internet companies rather than business schools and ended up moving to Seattle two months ago to work as an assistant product manager in Amazon.com's books division. "I love it," she said. Just as she imagines a business school to be, she added, "it's filled with a lot of very smart, enthusiastic people."
Even on campuses where applications have declined, school administrators say their schools continue to thrive. The most prestigious still admit only about one in eight candidates. Graduates are snapped up by consulting firms and investment banks -- and, increasingly, Internet start-ups. The heightened competition has forced some more traditional companies to offer new perquisites, like leaves of absence, in addition to starting salaries that sometimes reach $150,000.
"The market for M.B.A.'s is very exciting," Professor Jacobs of Northwestern said. "As long as we don't become irrelevant to what's happening in the marketplace, I think we're fine."
To stay relevant, schools are quickly creating new courses and changing lesson plans in existing classes to include Internet business. Earlier this month, Wharton announced that it was adding an e-commerce major, effective immediately, with 50 faculty members teaching courses.
At the University of Chicago this fall, two staff members had to stand outside a 9 a.m. Saturday Internet course on the first few days of class to prevent students not enrolled from sitting in on the lectures.
Still, a decline in the number of applications can be a serious matter for graduate schools, particularly in the M.B.A. world, where schools compete aggressively with one another. Such a drop can force admissions officers to be less selective in selecting a class, has the potential to drop a school's ranking in U.S. News & World Report's influential annual survey and can require a school to spend more money promoting itself.
Some less elite schools, which are often unknown in other countries, are faring the worst. At Tulane University, they fell more than 40 percent over the last two years, though the assistant dean for admissions, John Silbernagel, said he thought the pool was still of similar quality.
At the University of Iowa's Henry B. Tippie School of Management, where applications dropped by more than a quarter last spring, the acceptance rate rose to 37 percent, from 28 percent in 1998.
In response, the school has tripled its advertising budget and continued a recent push to send more unsolicited mail to people who take the admissions test, said Mary Spreen, the school's director of M.B.A. admissions and financial aid. "It has caused some concern," Ms. Spreen said. "When you have a larger applicant pool, you're able to attract a higher-quality class."
But business school can be a tough sell in the current, frenzied Internet environment. Many potential students hope to be among the early employees of a company, who typically receive a larger batch of stock options at a lower price than employees who join later. When Mr. Hyatt left his consulting job, at Mercer Management Consulting, for a summer stint at Winfire, which designs Internet software, it had 10 employees. It now has 40. Had he attended Stanford and joined after graduation, the company would have had 150 employees, he estimated.
The influx of venture capital even allows some Internet start-ups to offer high salaries, in addition to options, noted Mr. Hyatt, who said he was making more than $100,000 as the director of product management at Winfire.
The changing attitude toward the M.B.A. is particularly striking in Silicon Valley, a new center of American business and yet a place where business school has suddenly become less popular. Applications to Berkeley's program dropped by 11 percent last spring. At Stanford -- where school employees came up with the idea that led to the creation of Cisco Systems and whose graduates include top Internet executives like Scott McNealy of Sun Microsystems -- they fell 6 percent. These days, students worry that their chances of emulating such titans will decrease if they wait two years to start work.
Many of the start-ups are also making a big push to keep employees who have been at their jobs for two to seven years, traditionally a period of high turnover, Jacques Leger, a human resources consultant with Watson Wyatt in San Francisco, said. "Now, with two years of experience, you're considered a prime candidate with lots of experience," Mr. Leger said.
Students notice the difference. "The opportunity cost of going to school has gone up dramatically," said Cheryl Proctor, a second-year M.B.A. student at Berkeley, who watched some of her classmates quit this summer while many others work part-time jobs during the year to maintain contacts, she said.
Ms. Proctor herself spent last summer at a small Internet company in San Francisco that asked her to stay when her internship ended. "They made it really tempting," she said. But business school, she added, "seems like a safe bet."
Many school administrators predict that applications will start rising again everywhere as the Internet industry matures. One possible sign of resurgent interest in M.B.A. programs is already being seen: a small rebound in recent months in the number of Americans taking the admissions test.
"There is a gold-rush mentality" to the Internet, said Paul Danos, dean of the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth. "A lot of potential students will make the wrong decision. Everybody thinks they're all going to strike it rich, and it's just not going to happen."

HEADLINE: In Land of the Car, All Take the Wheel, Few Deign to Park

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Nov. 27

 BODY:
Los Angeles A to Z, an encyclopedia of this city's history and folkways published by the University of California Press, lists "automobile" as "a feature of the regional culture so dominant as to defy brief description," and that seems a safe understatement. Here in the region that perfected drive-through banking, drive-in restaurants and drive-by shootings, people do almost everything with their cars.
Everything, that is, except park them. 
 By the millions, Southern Californians routinely leave that task to others. In a city where the phrase "service economy" is taken for granted, valet parking thrives, and not just at restaurants, hotels and airports, where the service is increasingly popular around the country. Here you can leave the keys with Jeeves at hospitals and mini-malls, movie theaters and grocery stores, the occasional Starbucks and at least one gym, not to mention practically every fancy private party for 20 people or more. The Yellow Pages features 45 listings for Parking Attendant Service.
"Angelenos are lazy," said Chuck Pick, owner of Chuck's Parking Service, who has been parking cars for 40 years and provides valet service at special events for his third generation of Hollywood society. "No, not lazy," Mr. Pick quickly amended himself. "Service-oriented. But when I ever write a book, it's going to be how people lose their feet and legs when they go to a party. Suddenly, they can't walk.
"I have women call me up and say, 'Oh, I need valets,' and I say, 'Can I ask you a question? Do you walk from Saks to Neiman's?' And they say, 'Sure,' and I say, 'Well, why can't you walk across the street?' "
To be fair, there are so many cars in greater Los Angeles, and so many neighborhood parking restrictions, that valet parking is often the most efficient way to cram cars into a limited space. This is, after all, a city that had more than one car for every two residents as early as 1925, and where married couples still invariably arrive at workday movies or restaurant dates in separate cars and where the affluent often provide separate station wagons just for their nannies.
"People have grown to accept and expect it," said Herb Citrin, 77 and the chairman of Valet Parking Service. Mr. Citrin pioneered the industry here beginning in 1946 when he opened the parking concession at Lawry's Prime Rib in Beverly Hills, which he still serves today, along with about 60 other restaurants and hotels like the Regent Beverly Wilshire, plus the Burbank Airport. Mr. Citrin's business has 1,600 employees, many of them recent Hispanic immigrants, who earn an average of $6 to $7 an hour.
"Today, it's a major, major necessity," he said.
In fact, valet parking is so common that drivers of $70,000 luxury cars who would not entrust them to their own teenagers routinely hand them over to complete strangers, and sometimes assume that restaurants offer the service, even if they do not. At the Grill in Beverly Hills, the reigning power-lunch place for agents and moguls, there is no valet stand at lunch, because parking is so tight at that hour in Beverly Hills that it would cost the restaurant too much.
"But every once in a while, we will have somebody who pulls up, leaves their car running and goes in and eats lunch," said Bob Spivak, one of the restaurant's founding partners and now president of its parent company. "And they come back two hours later and the car's still sitting there, parked in the driveway with a ticket on it."
Most restaurants charge about $3.50, plus tip, for valet parking. On the other hand, even nonvalet parking in downtown office towers can easily cost four to five times as much.
In scores of places, though, valet parking is free for at least two hours, as it is in several municipal and merchant-sponsored lots in Beverly Hills. At the Century City Shopping Center, the sort of place where Betsy Bloomingdale goes to the movies, valet service is free with a $25 purchase of groceries at Gelson's, an upscale supermarket. Cedars-Sinai Medical Center has valet service, and so does the Commons at Calabassas, a giant mall in the suburban San Fernando Valley.
"I always valet park at Macy's men's store," said Marcella Benson, an office manager who was retrieving her gray Jaguar from the valet stand at the cavernous Beverly Center mall in Los Angeles, where valet parking is free with store validation. "It's convenient, they're trustworthy and no matter where you are in the mall, you always know how to get back here." Besides, Ms. Benson added: "I'm all for putting out money. It's good for the economy."
At the Sports Club/LA, perhaps the city's most luxurious gym, about 400 of the 1,600 daily visitors use valet parking, at $2.50 a car, twice the price for self-parking.
"We've really tried to coin the phrase of an urban country club," said Phil Swain, vice president and director of operations at the club, where a standard membership runs $1,250 for the initiation fee and $130 a month in dues. "It's a popular service, and members develop relationships with the attendants the way they do with their trainers. It really adds to that service aspect."
In 1978, Maureen Sullivan, a former shoe saleswoman to the stars in Beverly Hills, had the idea of using aspiring actresses for an all-female parking service, and now her Valettes Ltd., at $21 per attendant per hour, is a fixture at private parties here. The attendants dress in black jackets and pink tuxedo shirts and give a single rose to each car at the end of an event.
"In L.A., the parking's just gotten worse and worse, especially in the hills or the canyons," Ms. Sullivan said. "I have a lot of repeat business."
At Chuck's, whose attendants wear distinctive royal blue jackets, Mr. Pick is gearing up for his busiest season: 200 parties in the next two and a half weeks.
"There's nowhere else in the world that I could be making a living as nice as this, doing what I do," said Mr. Pick, who began parking cars at the old Romanoff's restaurant, a movie star haunt in Beverly Hills, and has parked cars at events for every president since Kennedy. "We do it all, whether it's one man or 100," he added. "We go from birth to death. We did a bris last week and we're doing two funerals this weekend."

HEADLINE: Croatia Looks Wistfully to Europe as Leader Nears Death

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER 

DATELINE: ZAGREB, Croatia, Nov. 27

 BODY:
The imminent death of Croatia's founder and president, Franjo Tudjman, no matter who succeeds him, will take much of the personal animosity and heat out of the country's strained relationships with Washington and the European Union, turning at least a part of the Balkans more firmly westward, senior Croatian officials and Western diplomats say.
The medical status of Mr. Tudjman, 77, whose myth is being burnished by his shaken political party even as he lies incommunicado, was relegated today by doctors to "very grave." 
 With parliamentary elections now scheduled for Jan. 3 -- elections a center-left opposition coalition is expected to win -- Mr. Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union, universally known here as H.D.Z., is trying "to exploit his disease and death to appeal to the sentiments of voters," said Slaven Letica, a former Tudjman adviser and political analyst.
But Mr. Tudjman's death "will bring good news to Croatia in political terms," Mr. Letica said. "In general, the Croatian people are tired of authoritarian leaders in this century -- we've already buried four of them," including Tito, the Croat-born founder of Yugoslavia, whom Mr. Tudjman has tried to emulate.
His death should also greatly improve relations with a Western world that wearied of Mr. Tudjman's historical obsessions and xenophobia.
Mr. Tudjman is revered here for his crucial role in creating this modern Croatia in 1991, out of the collapse of the Communist federation founded by Tito. But as a historian and nationalist, Mr. Tudjman also articulated and thus fed the country's paranoia about Western conspiracies to undermine and destroy the state.
Mr. Tudjman's obsessions included his unorthodox view that few Jews and Serbs were killed by the Croatian fascist regime, the Ustasha, during World War II and his conviction that the West wanted to control Croatia. His constant lectures to Western diplomats and statesmen about their injustice toward Croatia and their dark designs against it were a more passionate mirror of similar lectures from the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, according to those who have heard both.
Under Mr. Tudjman, Croatia has been ostracized much as Mr. Milosevic's Yugoslavia has been. Although Croatia has so far escaped the economic sanctions imposed on Mr. Milosevic, the autocratic, corrupt and sometimes comedic nature of Mr. Tudjman's state, combined with his repression of independent media and his unwillingness either to make Bosnia work or to cooperate with the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, have deepened his country's isolation.
Croatia, despite its fervent desire to join Europe, has been kept from two of the main waiting rooms for integration: NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace, which even Albania and Kazakhstan have been allowed to join, or the European Union's program known as Phare, the French word for beacon, which provides financial and technical assistance to nearly every other post-Communist country in Central Europe.
"Whatever else Tudjman's death brings, Croatia has a chance now to join the main currents of European history," said a senior Foreign Ministry official. "A democratic Croatia, if it gets help from the West, can be pivotal to bringing peace, democracy and stability to the region, including Bosnia."
That is also the fervent hope in Washington and Brussels, where officials would love to see a new, more outgoing president, like the current foreign minister, Mate Granic, who is a moderate member of the ruling party, and a new Parliament and government dominated by the opposition.
"There's a real possibility for Croatia to turn from being a major part of the problem in this part of the world into a success story and a big part of the solution," a senior Western diplomat said.
Croatian reality is likely to be more complicated than that. Mr. Tudjman's party, a broad congregation that may fragment after his death, has not yet picked a possible successor and appears afraid to be seen to do so while the patriarchal president still breathes.
"We have been living in a form of prepolitics," said Marinko Culic of the weekly Feral Tribune and author of a new book: "Tudjman: The Anatomy of Unenlightened Absolutism."
"We've had enough of men of vision," he said. "But I'm not convinced the opposition will win. It won't be clear cut, and I'm not sure the opposition will hold together."
Some of Mr. Tudjman's nationalist obsessions "have been transferred to the opposition, too," Mr. Culic said. "Croatia won't be liberated so easily from the issues Mr. Tudjman pushed," like the paternalistic and constitutional ties to Bosnia's Croats. "In part this will remain a small, closed, xenophobic state, but Croatia will still find its place in the international community."
Drazen Budisa, the leader of the opposition Social Liberal party, admitted in an interview that the opposition must protect its "nationalist" front in the election. This May, Mr. Budisa refused to go on a trip to Washington to meet officials -- the only one of the six opposition leaders to stay home -- because of government criticism.
Mr. Tudjman's death "will define the character of the political campaign and it will be to the detriment of the opposition," Mr. Budisa said, especially after a huge state funeral with the participation of the church. The opposition coalition -- actually two allied coalitions of six parties in total -- will hang together, nonetheless, he predicted, even though it has also not agreed on a single presidential candidate.
"Tudjman's death will improve relations with Washington and the European Union, too," Mr. Budisa said. "But political support for us from abroad does not give us votes in Croatia. We need to have a balanced policy. So support us more after we win."
Ivica Racan, leader of the Social Democrats, admitted that both he and Mr. Budisa could end up running for the presidency. "I'm sure we will hold together," he said, although he admitted that there would be severe competition for limited posts even if the opposition wins control of Parliament.
The opposition's eventual rule might be short-lived given the severe economic problems it would inherit, including a bloated state sector, recession, $10 billion in foreign debt, a $2-billion budget deficit for next year and high unemployment. A responsible government would have to increase popular pain to begin to restructure the economy, and it is questionable whether the West, preoccupied with Serbia and Kosovo, will provide sufficient assistance to ease the transition.
Senior Western officials and diplomats say that Mr. Tudjman's tirades were tedious and deeply annoying. On the issues Washington pressed hardest -- democratization, compliance with the Dayton accords that ended the Bosnian war in 1995 and the return of ethnic Serbs to Croatian territory from which they were expelled that same year -- "Tudjman was fundamentally opposed to each of them and his leadership made progress difficult if not impossible on all of them," a senior Western diplomat said.
In general, he said, in a version confirmed by others, Mr. Tudjman had four constant themes. First, that "they" in the West were opposed to the creation of Croatia, so "they are punishing us for our independence and holding us to an unfairly high standard."
Second, that "it's all a plot" to keep Croatia down, whether the issue is compliance with the war crimes tribunal, membership in Partnership for Peace, World Bank reluctance to ignore economic corruption and mismanagement or highly critical reports on the state of human rights by Washington or the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
Third, "they want to keep us in the Balkans and create a new Yugoslavia and stick us back where we don't belong."
And fourth, that the country is rife with "foreign enemies" -- spies and journalists and aid workers -- who "are in the pay and in collaboration with foreigners" and who "buy the loyalty of Croatian trash" who work with them.
Jagoda Vukusic of the newspaper Novi List said that Mr. Tudjman's death will change the whole tone of Croatian political life. "I can imagine the H.D.Z. winning, but still it won't be the same party," she said. "They have to grow up quickly too and are trying to become a real party and more democratic.
The death of Mr. Tudjman will be a kind of release for them, too, she said. "It gives us the possibility of becoming a more normal, boring country," she said. "Ah, to be boring. I'm waiting for that."

HEADLINE: Global Trade Forum Reflects A Burst Of Conflict and Hope

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
For the last half-century, government officials from around the world have gathered every few years to talk about trade. Delegates, who could often fit in a single hotel, debated arcana of tariff tables and export subsidies and were largely ignored by the world press.
When trade ministers assemble in Seattle this week to attend the meeting of the World Trade Organization, the scene will be almost unrecognizable. Negotiating teams from 134 countries have booked almost every hotel room in the city. Tariff reductions are still on the agenda, but they will be fighting for attention with health care, food safety, clear air, endangered species, child labor and cultural imperialism. 
 And that's only inside the closed-door sessions. Outside, tens of thousands of demonstrators plan to use the Seattle meeting to campaign against what they see as the trade organization's role in worsening air pollution, killing animals and undermining national sovereignty -- in short, letting globalization run amok.
The trade forum hopes that the meeting will start up a new round of global trade talks, tentatively named the "Millennium Round," that would flatten trade barriers to their lowest levels in modern history and gain greater access to world markets for service providers like telecommunications companies.
But the talks will also test support for freer trade in both rich and poor countries, especially since delegates will face a giant, 1960's-style protest campaign meant to mobilize worldwide opposition to new trade efforts.
Trade forum members and observers of the talks say there is a reasonable chance that the Seattle meeting will result in only token progress, disappointing agriculture, entertainment and electronic commerce industries hoping for new liberalization, but cheering critics who would like to see the group hobbled.
Despite weeks of meetings to work out a formal agenda for the meeting, negotiators broke off last week without agreeing on what to talk about. Further complicating the picture, the United States and the Europeans want the trade group to help resolve global disputes on labor and the environment that even a few years ago were considered beyond the purview of its small, specialized bureaucracy. The push for expanding the Geneva-based trade group's mandate has divided the developed and less-developed countries.
"There's a real worry that the W.T.O. could become a victim of its own success," says Daniel K. Tarullo, a former Clinton administration economics official who is now a professor at Georgetown University. "It was effective in freeing up trade, but it's straining under the weight of issues that go well beyond conventional trade."
The Clinton administration is determined to make the best of the Seattle talks. Charlene Barshefsky, the trade representative, says the United States hopes to make progress on reducing tariffs on farm goods and promoting trade in services. "Failure is not an option," she said late last week.
But Washington has an uphill battle. Japan and the European Union, determined to protect their heavily subsidized farmers, have fought broad cuts on agricultural tariffs.
The Clinton administration's effort to make labor and environmental issues a central part of negotiations has brought a backlash from poorer countries and only tepid support from rich ones.
Economic analysts are more optimistic about prospects for extending the tax-free treatment of electronic commerce around the world, a high priority for the United States and Internet companies.
Other rounds of trade talks have begun amid heavy politicking but have ended up producing broad accords that free up trade. Just four years ago, the trade organization was born of a much weaker negotiating group, the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade. By many measures it has been a success. Borders are now more open, and trade is more important to the international economy than at any time since before the Great Depression.
Yet the issues this time are especially tricky, in large part because the definition of trade keeps getting broader. When the talks were mostly about tariffs, they involved the way countries treated imports at their borders. But with tariff levels lower, the emphasis has shifted to services like banking, telecommunications and even education and culture. Thus trade issues are cutting deeper into local policy and politics.
"Trade has become a more intrusive issue in domestic politics," said Peter S. Watson, a Washington trade expert and former head of the International Trade Commission, "and that has, unfortunately, made it a vehicle for discontent."
Seemingly overnight, the trade group has become the target of those opposed to what they consider the excesses of globalization.
The protesters now descending on Seattle represent groups pushing environmental, labor and third world development causes, and they do not speak with once voice. Among the divisions is whether the trade group should be abolished or reformed. But common refrains include accusations that the forum tramples social standards in the name of trade and that it acts in secrecy and without democratic oversight.
"This is about democracy -- about letting an unelected bureaucracy in Geneva undermine our laws," said Jerry Mander, director of the California-based International Forum on Globalization. "We need to stop it in its tracks, before it starts controlling agriculture and bioengineering and many other things."
In Seattle, which finds itself gearing up for large street protests, the celebratory mood that accompanied the city's selection as host site is clearly tempered by nervousness.
Protesters say they expect 50,000 people, possibly many more. Publicly at least, city leaders insist that the groups are welcome and that Seattle, site of the nation's first general strike in 1919, will be a model host for ministers and dissenters alike.
Some union members plan a Seattle Steel Party, modeled on the Boston Tea Party, in which they will dump Chinese steel into the city harbor here. (In deference to the environment, the steel will be retrieved.)
Free trade has many supporters, of course, and Seattle is also the home of Boeing and Microsoft, two of America's largest exporters. At least one group, Working Families for Free Trade, which is being organized by Christian conservative leaders, plans a rally on Monday.
The trade group has become such a target of ire in part because it has proved one of the most powerful world bodies of any kind. Unlike the trade and tariffs group, its predecessor, this trade group has the power to decide disputes on its own and impose penalties on countries that do not abide by its conclusions. To avoid pressure from lobby groups and possible adverse effects on international financial markets, three-judge panels decide cases in closed chambers without having to reveal much about the process. Most of the appointee judges are trade lawyers.
The group has heard almost 200 trade disputes in four years. Most are garden variety protectionist issues, such as whether Japan can tax domestic saki at different rates from imported whiskey, and whether Canadian scallops sold in France can be called coquilles Saint-James.
But several cases brought before the forum have linked trade to the environment and health. In one, for example, a trade group panel ruled against the United States, which had banned imports of shrimp from Asian countries that do not use fishing nets intended to protect endangered turtles.
The case that got the most attention was brought by the United States and Canada against the European Union, which banned the import of hormone-treated beef raised in North America. Two trade panels -- the first ruling was appealed -- decided that the European Union did not have an adequate scientific basis for excluding such beef.
Critics have argued that the ruling limits the rights of governments to set basic food-safety standards. But supporters of the trade forum dismiss the criticism as hyperbole. The group has not tried to legislate environmental or food safety standards, they say, but simply to ensure that a country does not use such standards as a pretext for discriminating against imported goods.
But even the Clinton administration, a strong proponent of the group, has called for changes. President Clinton, who will attend the Seattle talks for two days this week, plans to push for reforms. Among his proposals: introduce more transparency into the trade group's decision-making, and let observers attend some sessions.
One reason that the group has become more prominent -- and contested -- is that Mr. Clinton and leaders of the European Union keep trying to expand its role. Mr. Clinton has been seeking to persuade trade forum members that the group should set and enforce international labor standards and outlaw at least some kinds of child labor. This could give the group sweeping powers to police treatment of workers. The proposal seems designed to satisfy unions, many of which argue that recent free-trade agreements have given American jobs to countries with lower wages and less rigorous labor laws.
Developing countries have strenuously opposed the labor initiative as protectionism. The European Union has offered only tepid support, and experts do not expect major progress on the issue at this meeting.
There is stronger Western backing for another Clinton initiative: giving environmentalists more power to review trade agreements. Ms. Barshefsky, the trade representative, has called for the forum to monitor trade issues "proactively" to weigh environmental impact. Having had several environmental laws challenged by developing countries, the Clinton administration wants the group to respect its right to exclude imports that do not meet United States environmental standards.
"Many third world countries think environment and labor are a Trojan horse for turning the W.T.O. into a forum that enforces Western rights," said Mr. Watson, the Washington analyst. "To the extent that the W.T.O. is not about trade -- and reducing trade barriers -- it is on shaky ground."

HEADLINE: Sharpton Assails Crackdown on Homeless

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

 BODY:
The Rev. Al Sharpton yesterday denounced Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's recent crackdown on homeless people and called on New Yorkers to monitor and report police efforts to sweep the homeless off the streets. Mr. Sharpton said he planned to hold an all-night "tent city" vigil for the homeless at City Hall Park on Dec. 5.
Speaking to a packed room at a rally at the National Action Network, his headquarters in Harlem, Mr. Sharpton called the arrests a politically motivated attempt to curry favor with voters after a brutal attack on a woman in Midtown two weeks ago. 
 He was surrounded by civil libertarians, clergy, advocates for the homeless and Cornel West, the Harvard professor who is a leading scholar of African-American studies and a best-selling author of books about race in America.
Mr. Sharpton said he would hold the vigil, where participants would sleep on the grass and sidewalks of City Hall Park, with or without a permit.
He called the mayor's crackdown "unfair, class-based and in many ways, race-based," adding that New Yorkers had a responsibility for "protecting the rights of those who are the new targets of this mayor, who has gone out of control."
On Nov. 19, Mayor Giuliani said that the homeless had no right to sleep on the streets, and his police commissioner added that they could be arrested if they refuse shelter. That announcement came three days after a young woman, Nicole Barrett, was critically injured when she was struck from behind with a brick. Investigators have said they believe the man who attacked her could be homeless.
Since the crackdown, the police have arrested more than 100 homeless people. "Don't think that this is not an issue that the mayor is using as a political tool in the Senate race," Mr. Sharpton said.
The crackdown has been complicated by a Giuliani administration policy, which will go into effect soon, that forces people out of shelters if they refuse to work in the city's workfare program.
One of the rally's other speakers, Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said that the two policies, both of questionable legality, created a "whipsaw" effect that criminalized being homeless by pushing people out of shelters and into the streets, where they could then be arrested and put in jail.
Professor West echoed Mr. Sharpton's sentiments and also derided the mayor for other initiatives like forcing homeless AIDS patients to work or be kicked out of shelters.
But he cautioned that the problem was broader than Mr. Giuliani. "He's just a symptom of something else going on in this city," Mr. West said.
Professor West said that, even as the economy has boomed, "poor people are being segregated by powerful people like Mayor Giuliani."
A common theme among the speakers was that despite the good times, politicians need issues to galvanize support and that it appeared that Mr. Giuliani was using the homeless as scapegoats.
Patrick Markee, a public policy analyst for the Coalition for the Homeless, told the audience that Mr. Giuliani's policies will have the effect of pushing homeless people off the streets and into other more dangerous places, such as parks and abandoned buildings.
Mayor Giuliani has defended his efforts to force people in shelters to work and sweeping homeless people off the street as the compassionate thing to do, adding that his critics feel guilty about what little they have done about the problem.
Mr. Siegel scoffed at the notion. "When he talks about the homeless advocates being filled with guilt," Mr. Siegel said, "perhaps he is projecting, perhaps he feels guilty for having done nothing for the homeless in the past six years."
The speakers said that if Mr. Giuliani really wanted to help the homeless, he would divert the resources from law enforcement toward job training and low-income housing.
Mr. Giuliani's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, declined to comment.
Mayor Giuliani's supporters argue that he has done more for the homeless than his most recent predecessors. The budget for homeless services, now at $420 million, has been increased $30 million in the past six years.
Those supporters also argue that the Giuliani administration has put more money into mental health, substance abuse treatment, employment services and security at city shelters.
Organizers of the planned City Hall Park rally do not yet have a permit and would not be allowed to hold the event without one.
The Giuliani administration has been criticized for its reluctance to issue permits to groups the mayor disagrees with, but the battle over this rally could become particularly sticky given that city officials have restricted access to the steps and the plaza in front of City Hall since August 1998, after the bombings of American embassies in East Africa.
Marilyn Mode, the Police Department's chief spokeswoman, warned that "you can't spend the night in a park, and if Mr. Sharpton and his followers break the law by sleeping in the park, they will be arrested."
But Mr. Sharpton said that he and his followers will make the symbolic gesture of standing by the homeless, by sleeping in City Hall Park on Dec. 5.
"In the spirit of Martin Luther King," he said, "we'll park our tents in City Hall Park and tell Mayor Giuliani that we do not want to live in a city that locks up our homeless, but one that lifts up our homeless."

HEADLINE: Pataki Seeks a Trade-Off With Democrats to Cut Medicaid

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, Nov. 27

 BODY:
In secret negotiations, Gov. George E. Pataki is pushing his Democratic rivals in the Legislature to cut Medicaid spending steeply as part of a deal to preserve a program that pays hospitals billions of dollars to treat uninsured patients and train doctors, according to people involved in the talks.
The $2.7 billion state program is set to expire at the end of the year, and Mr. Pataki has not said exactly what he plans to do about it. But Democrats and representatives of the health care workers' unions privately say that the governor is using the program's looming expiration to try to force reductions in Medicaid -- across-the-board cuts that he has sought nearly every year in office, usually without success. 
 The administration concedes that the two programs have been linked in private talks in recent weeks, but insists that it has not made renewal of the subsidies contingent on cutting Medicaid. The administration also notes that it would not be bothering to pursue the current negotiations if the other side had not signaled a willingness to consider the governor's proposals.
"All the parties have indicated that they want to negotiate in good faith," said one official close to the governor. "We believe that all the parties have an open mind."
The state program of hospital subsidies, the Health Care Reform Act, is financed through surcharges added to all hospital bills, inflating medical expenses. Mr. Pataki's business allies have urged him to reduce the charges, contending that employers end up paying most of them through higher insurance premiums for workers.
The stakes are enormous: New York's hospitals operate on thin margins, and would quickly be unable to meet their bills without the enormous subsidy created by the surcharges. The program also pays to insure children in tens of thousands of low-income families who will lose that health coverage if the program is not renewed.
Nevertheless, each side appears prepared to force a standoff with the Dec. 31 deadline fast approaching. The powerful hospital workers' unions and their Democratic allies vow to wage political war against the governor if he makes any move to scale back the program or greatly reduce state financing for hospitals. But officials close to Mr. Pataki privately say they doubt that he would suffer any serious political consequences, given his popularity and the fact that he is not up for re-election until 2002.
The Health Care Reform Act was adopted three years ago as part of an effort to deregulate New York's health care industry and open it to market forces. For decades, New York had been one of a handful of states that set the rates that hospitals could charge for all medical procedures, from an appendectomy to open-heart surgery. The hospitals had no say in what to charge, and insurers had no say in what to pay.
But in 1996, at Mr. Pataki's urging, the state stopped setting rates. That change introduced an era of fierce competition in which hospitals were forced to negotiate with powerful insurers over the price of procedures that now total $16 billion a year.
But one element of the old system was retained in an effort to shield New York's hospitals, many of them economically distressed, from the full brunt of market forces. The state continued to add charges to all hospital bills, although the charges are one-third less than they were under the old system, to provide subsidies.
The largest part of that money, about $780 million a year, goes toward reimbursing hospitals for payments they cannot collect from patients, usually those who are poor and uninsured. The second largest piece, about $540 million annually, goes to teaching hospitals to train doctors just out of medical school. A third piece, worth about $210 million, was created to provide health coverage for low-income children.
According to people involved in the negotiations, the governor is seeking to wring some savings for the state by restraining its fast-growing Medicaid program. The program, which pays for medical care for the poor and the elderly, represents the largest part of the state budget, totaling about $28 billion a year.
The scope of the cuts that Mr. Pataki wants is not clear. But according to people involved in the negotiations, he is at the very least seeking an extension of a series of Medicaid cuts that are due to expire on April 1. Those cuts total $1 billion a year in federal, state and local financing for the program, and the governor would like to renew them for at least four years.
Democrats who control the State Assembly have not completely ruled out Governor Pataki's proposal. But in the end, Democratic leaders are likely to take their cue from labor groups, most notably the leaders of 1199, the National Health and Human Service Employees Union, who say they oppose any reduction in state support for hospitals.
The governor has also indicated that he wants to cut the money used to pay hospitals to train young doctors, though he has not indicated how much of a cut he wants, according to those involved in the talks.
That proposal is likely to meet with stiff resistance from Democrats and union leaders, who regard the money as crucial to the survival of teaching hospitals. Their resolve is most likely to be strengthened now that Congress has made deep Medicare cuts for New York's teaching hospitals in the budget it has sent to President Clinton.
But some Republicans have suggested replacing the current funding source for doctors' training with cash that the state is expected to receive from last year's settlement of a national lawsuit against the tobacco industry. But it is not clear whether Mr. Pataki will do that.
The governor has offered some inducements, according to those involved in the talks. Privately, he has said that he is willing to expand health care coverage for the poor and the uninsured -- something that Democrats and union leaders support, though they would like to use tobacco money for such an initiative. It is not clear how Mr. Pataki intends to do that, though he is said to be looking into tax cuts as an incentive for small-business owners to provide health benefits to their employees.
One of the biggest uncertainties the governor faces is the response of the Republican majority in the State Senate. Its members are allied with Mr. Pataki and believe there is a need to cut health care costs. But they also want to avoid a battle with the health care workers' unions, since they are up for re-election next year, and to protect hospitals, which are among the biggest employers in most Senate districts.
So far, the Republicans in the Senate have stuck by the governor, allowing him to try to negotiate a deal with Democrats and the union leaders. But at the same time, some officials have indicated that the Republican majority is prepared to step in if the negotiations stall, possibly with a proposal to renew the existing system of surcharges before they expire. It is not clear, though, whether such a move would satisfy union leaders who are calling for some changes to the current system.

HEADLINE: THE NEEDIEST CASES;
Navigating the Bureaucracy After an Accident

BYLINE: By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
Scott MacDonough does not remember being hit. All he remembers is the car's headlights coming closer, and a last-minute instinct to protect his dog, Alexis.
After the accident on West 96th Street, in August 1998, Alexis got to live in a large house in Connecticut, but Mr. MacDonough, a former movie publicist who had worked on some of Woody Allen's most famous films, including "Annie Hall" and "Manhattan," was not so lucky. Despite three operations and countless hours of physical therapy, he still cannot walk, and is a virtual shut-in in the one-room apartment where he has lived since 1970. 
 "I was first told I'd be able to walk by December. Then it was going to be the spring. Then it was going to be the summer," he said. "Now they're not even bothering to tell me."
When Mr. MacDonough, 55, who has not been able to work since the accident, stopped receiving Medicaid payments for three weeks, he called the Community Service Society of New York. The service society's Public Benefits Resource Center helped him navigate the public assistance bureaucracy and obtain Social Security Disability Income and Medicaid coverage for his physical therapy.
The Community Service Society is one of seven local charities supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which begins its 88th appeal today.
The fund was created in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, then publisher of The Times, who was moved by a chance encounter with a beggar on Christmas Day, 1911. The man said he had just eaten Christmas dinner at a Y.M.C.A., but had no money for lodging and nowhere to sleep. Mr. Ochs eyed him carefully and decided he looked respectable, and gave him a few dollars and one of his cards. "If you're looking for a job," he said, "come see me tomorrow." When the man came to The Times, Mr. Ochs gave him a job.
Mr. Ochs soon decided that if his readers knew about the suffering around them, they would be eager to contribute. The first campaign raised $3,630.88 from 117 contributors. This year, the fund will accept donations by credit card via the Web for the first time, at www.nytimes.com/neediest. The Times pays the fund's administrative costs, so every dollar donated goes directly to those in need.
Individual donors allow the agencies, among the oldest and most respected in New York, to provide money at a critical moment in a person's life. The donations can keep a struggling family from breaking apart, give an abandoned child hope for the future or help a battered woman regain her confidence.
Last year, more than 13,000 readers donated to the fund, including two 8-year-old girls who gave the $80.50 they had made selling homemade cookies on the sidewalk; a couple from Ronkonkoma, N.Y., who raised $570 by asking the guests at their 50th anniversary party to give checks to the fund in lieu of gifts; and a group of young Wall Street analysts who each year organize a fund drive among their peers. All told, a record of $6,582,341.37 was raised for New York's poor.
For Mr. MacDonough, assistance came in the form of a professional caseworker, Leslie Boutin, who spent nearly 20 hours dealing with city agencies to make sure that his Medicaid was not lost in his transition to Social Security Disability Income.
During the three weeks that Mr. MacDonough's Medicaid coverage lapsed, he had to pay for his prescriptions out of his own pocket, and he found the expense was quickly becoming too high for him to afford.
Mr. MacDonough, who lives on Riverside Drive on the Upper West Side, was responsible for getting movies publicized in the media, but when he was working with Woody Allen, he said, much of his assignment was politely keeping people away. "I told Woody, 'You don't need a unit publicist, you need a unit doberman,' " he said.
Mr. MacDonough said he never imagined he could end up in such dire circumstances. "However careful you are crossing the streets, it can happen to anyone," he said. "We don't realize this until it happens."
As this year's appeal begins, there is plenty of evidence that New York City's economy is booming, from new construction projects to throngs of tourists to sky-high rents charged for apartments. Yet underneath these signs of prosperity is the hard fact that New York City has a much higher level of poverty than the country as a whole.
According to the most recent Current Population Survey completed by the United States Census Bureau, using data from 1997 and 1998, 24.8 percent of New York City residents live in poverty, almost double the 13 percent poverty rate in the rest of the country.
"New York State has, for a wealthy state, a very high level of poverty," said Frank Mauro, executive director of the Fiscal Policy Institute, a research group in Latham, N.Y., that studies the state's economy. He said New York is the only state to be ranked in the top 10 by the Census Bureau both in poverty and per capita income. "It just shows that we're a city and a state of these extremes of wealth and poverty. It shows the need for both governmental and private efforts to address this situation."
One private agency that is working to make a difference is the UJA-Federation of New York, another charity that receives support from the Neediest Cases Fund.
"We have a remarkable paradox in New York City at the moment," said John Ruskay, chief executive of the UJA-Federation. "On the one hand, there is unprecedented wealth accumulation that is benefiting broad sectors of New Yorkers. However, at the same time, there is a less visible New York, which our agencies encounter every day in increased demand for food, cash assistance to pay essential bills, housing, and child care."
Mr. Ruskay said he is finding it harder to get members of the younger generation to give to the charity. "Many of our older donors, in their 60's and 70's, were themselves born in very modest circumstances, and therefore experienced firsthand the problems of the poor," he said. "At the moment, most of those in their 30's and 40's were raised in middle-class circumstances. Poverty was more distant, if not remote."
Philip Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society, which also receives support from Neediest Cases, said: "That money that we receive is absolutely incredible because it enables us to do things that we otherwise absolutely couldn't do. It helps us with big things like helping to have their parents not be evicted, and little things like a birthday party."
Now that Mr. MacDonough is not so preoccupied with paying his medical bills, he can turn his attention to other things, like getting his screenplay, "Shadow on Barrow Street," which he said received a rave review from his friend the movie critic Rex Reed two days before his accident, made into a movie.
"Thank God they called me back," he said, referring to the Community Service Society's Public Benefits Resource Center. "If they hadn't come to my help, I don't know what I would have done."

U.S. Economy Steams Ahead

 BODY:
The government's latest snapshot of the nation's $8.9 trillion economy revealed even more momentum than had been thought.
With employment, incomes, consumer optimism and stock market indexes all at or near peaks, the Commerce Department raised its estimate of economic growth in the third quarter to an annual rate of 5.5 percent, from 4.8. percent. 
 That pace surpassed nearly all predictions. "How can you not be thankful?" asked James Glassman, chief United States economist at Chase Securities.
But some analysts warned that unless the growth slows sharply, the Federal Reserve could feel compelled to raise interest rates again and threaten the long-running expansion.

Trying to Figure Out What Space to Save

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS

DATELINE: TRENTON

 BODY:
MOST people get interested in land use at the moment that, say, Wal-Mart announces plans to build across the street. But Judy Jengo is the sort of person who started going to her borough planning board meetings -- after a day at work on environmental issues -- for fun.
Ms. Jengo is now the executive director of the new Garden State Preservation Trust, which just started shopping with the millions of tax dollars set aside for open-space preservation. It is is one thing for the voters to check "yes" on a ballot proposal to save more land, as they did by a 2-to-1 ratio last November, and another to figure out whose backyard will be preserved. 
 So the job of overseeing the state's spending went to a woman who has given her 13 years here to environmental concerns, most recently as a deputy commissioner of environmental protection, and whose absolute favorite subject is land-use planning.
"We have to focus both on preservation and on curbing sprawl," Ms. Jengo said of Governor Whitman's goal of preserving one million acres, about a fifth of the state, in 10 years. "You can't just do it all by buying open space."
As she spoke, in a gentle voice suited to a teacher, her fingers kept intertwining. The trust, she explained, has to choose from hundreds of applications by local governments and nonprofit organizations as well as proposals for state purchases, making sure that dozens of competing environmental priorities are served and that it all makes sense when the green spaces are all plotted on the map of New Jersey.
It promises to be a popular undertaking. "People have been supporting open space ever since the first bond issue in 1961, the first Green Acres bond issue," Ms. Jengo said. "And there are polls, and the public support is stunning, overwhelming, always by a 2-to-1 margin or better for curbing sprawl, for better planning, for open-space preservation, farmland preservation, lessening traffic congestion.
"The elected officials saw the same thing," she said. "This is what people want. It's very smart policy and very smart politics."
Ms. Jengo was appointed to the new post by the governor in October, three months after the trust was established, but she moved into her new office just last week. In the meantime, she was also finishing almost two years' work on the administration's revised regulations for development in coastal areas, only to get a kick in the shins when the Senate voted two weeks ago to send them back for redrafting.
As Ms. Jengo was turning over the job of fending off a subsequent attack in the Assembly, the trust was choosing its first candidates for acquisition, from one-third of an acre on the Raritan Bay to a 200-acre addition to a preserve in Hunterdon County. It also approved farmland preservation and recreation projects.
The trust, working from backlogged Green Acres and farmland preservation applications, assigned rankings to them. It will submit its list for the Legislature's approval, and the first $88 million will be dispensed.
Ms. Jengo will oversee the day-to-day work of this whole messy process from the trust's new home in a brownstone across from the State House. For now, she is wedged into an office with stacks of cardboard cartons and a small forest of dracenas and ficus trees.
Ms. Jengo, 43, has earned a long list of resume entries in this neighborhood. She arrived 13 years ago, from the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management, as an environmental policy adviser for the Legislature. In 1994 she became Mrs. Whitman's senior environmental adviser and started working on what would become the governer's open-space initiative. She moved to the environmental protection department almost two years ago.
"She's a perfect fit," Michael Catania, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Nature Conservancy. "She's ebullient and just absolutely dedicated and passionate about open space. She was the one who had the most to do with the governor embracing the million-acre goal."
To Patrick O'Keefe, director of the New Jersey Builders Association, Ms. Jengo's appointment is is one of considerable concern." "If her track record is any indication," Mr. O'Keefe said, "we don't anticipate a very forthcoming and open operation."
But William G. Dressel Jr., director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities, said Ms. Jengo was "accessible, very forthright." He also mentioned her fierce work habit, recalling the time he called to leave a voice mail message before leaving home for the weekend.
"It was like eight o' clock on Saturday morning and she was at her desk," he said. "In this business, quite frankly, you don't meet that many state bureaucrats that are that conscientious."
Ms. Jengo says she spent many 13- and 14-hour days at the Department of Environmental Protection, leaving her postgraduate work at Rutgers, where she is a Ph.D. candidate in land-use policy. She spent many of them with municipal officials along the Shore and Delaware Bay areas ("we made house calls," she says), poring over maps, explaining the proposed development regulations and bending them to address local complaints.
Yet Mr. O'Keefe maintains Ms. Jengo and her staff shut out the builders association. "They went out and met with selected groups,' he said. For her part, Ms. Jengo said she met with the association's top staff members as well as many builders in the coastal areas.
"There are builders who think these rules are good," she said.
The experience sealed Ms. Jengo's reputation for persistence. She cannot even say how many legislators, mayors and township managers she met. "I so lost track," she said. "My car put on a lot of mileage."
The open-space plan, she said, can only be good news for local governments, as Mrs. Whitman insisted when she took it on.
"When the governor made this decision to go ahead, she said she was going to get it done and she was going to get it done in 1998, period," Ms. Jengo said. "And she went out and stumped around the state every day for months."
Now, she said, "towns are realizing the economic benefit of preservation."
"Folks really used to think, understandably, that all development would bring in the ratables and help the budgets," she said, "but as more and more people have been doing the math, they realize it's not that simple that it's true that if you build in the right places, but not if you build in places that cant sustain it.
"In those places it just raises taxes," she said. "It is no mystery that we have the highest property taxes in the nation and are the most densely developed. Property taxes in New Jersey more than doubled in the 1980's when we had the building boom."
She added, "In the 1990's, people started to sense an even greater urgency," approving local open-space funds to stave off development.
Ms. Jengo glimpsed these concerns long ago. "I grew up in suburbia, in sprawl, if you will," she said, "after being born in Jersey City and moving out to the suburbs."
There followed a common 1960's story: "When we moved to our house it was all woods behind us, and shortly afterward it became another subdivision and all of the trees came down. We lost our place to play."
Ms. Jengo took an interest in trees anyway, and majored in environmental management at Rutgers. She earned a master's at Colorado State University and worked in Idaho for the federal Fish and Wildlife Service.
Then, she said, apologetically, "I said, How can I have the most impact? It's not collecting deer poop on some slope. I realized it means being involved where policy is being made."
So she went into government, first in Rhode Island, and realized that policy is all about using money. Now she has to devise ways of leveraging enough to protect one million acres with $1.5 billion to spend on property that many environmentalists say is unattainable.
When she speaks to local groups about using money, she sometimes mentions her own town, Hopewell. Ten years ago, when the city planner had every square inch of the borough map covered with little houses-to-be, some questioned the wisdom of all that growth, only to be told that the experts knew best.
When a 57-acre farm came up for sale, "this little group went door to door," she said. "Fifty-seven acres in our town cost a boatload of money."
But they raised $250,000 in three weeks, and got a matching $250,000 from a donor to buy the property for the town.
"And suddenly," she said, "the mayor became very supportive."
 
A Sample of the State's First Acquisitions
 
TRENTON
The Garden State Preservation Trust announced its first round of spending this month, choosing from projects that were eligible for money through the Green Acres program but were stalled when the fund ran out of money.
Here is a random sample of the acquisitions and recreation projects:
* $4 million for a total of 35 acres in Emerson and Haworth in Bergen County to preserve land around the Oradell Reservoir.
* $50,000 to improve a playground in Ringwood, Passaic County.
* $1.2 million for 168 acres of woodland in Hopewell Township, Mercer County, to include hiking trails.
* $1.5 million for five acres in Edison Township to expand a park and add athletic fields.
* $500,000 to restore a portion of the Asbury Park boardwalk.
* $500,000 to Bridgewater Township, Somerset County, to buy open space in the path of development.
* $140,000 to create a wildlife refuge and nature center on a reservoir in Clark and Scotch Plains.
* $240,000 to purchase 22 acres of Pine Barrens habitat in Medford Township, Burlington County, as part of a plan for a 4,000-acre preserve.
* 500,000 to the Greater Newark Conservancy for an outdoor ecology center.

Whether as Dream or Nightmare, the City Looms Uncommonly Large in the Minds of Dominicans, New York's Largest Immigrant Group

BYLINE: By SETH KUGEL

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic

 BODY:
HE who dies without seeing New York dies blind," goes the Dominican saying, and countless citizens in this Caribbean nation of eight million have heeded those words. Although the Dominican Republic is only the 85th most populous country in the world, it has been the No. 1 source of legal immigrants to New York City for 23 of the last 25 years, sending an estimated 345,000 people in that period.
Like most other groups of immigrants, some Dominicans establish themselves in New York and succeed financially; others find only unhappiness in a crowded, confusing city. The majority fall somewhere in between. But the sheer scale of the
influx -- about 30 flights a day go from the Dominican Republic to La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark Airports on American Airlines alone -- has injected images of New York into the daily life of the Dominican Republic to an extent that might be unparalleled anywhere else in the world. 
 Here in the capital city Dominicans can get their hair cut at the Manhattan Barbershop, whose facade features a painted image of the Statue of Liberty holding hair clippers. They can shoot pool at the Bronx Billiard Club and pick up a necklace at New York Jewelers. In the city of Santiago, Dominicans can get their picture taken at a photo studio that offers backdrops of New York scenes like the Brooklyn Bridge.
So many returning Dominican immigrants live in the city of San Pedro de Macoris that residents there have informally renamed two neighborhoods Queens and Harlem. A map of North America distributed by a Santo Domingo car rental company shows New York as a region stretching as far west as Cincinnati. Some less-educated Dominicans routinely refer to secondary destinations for Dominican migration, like Massachusetts, Florida and even Spain, as "states" of New York. The terms "abroad" and "New York" are sometimes used interchangeably.
Immigration to New York is a common theme in Dominican popular culture, especially in merengue music. "How many big things does New York have?" sings Luis Vargas. "The Twin Towers, avenues that go up and down, Broadway, St. Nicholas, anyone would go crazy. How many sirens? How many strange things? My God!" The most popular Dominican film of the 1990's, "Nueba Yol," named for the way some Dominicans pronounce "New York" in Spanish, chronicles the struggles of the popular television character Balbuena as he mortgages his house to chase his dreams in the Big Apple.
The presence of New York in daily life is taken for granted by most Dominicans, who often have well-developed opinions on the merits of living there versus staying home. Dominican immigration to the United States began en masse after the assassination in 1961 of the dictator Rafael Trujillo brought an end to an era of terror and persecution that included highly restrictive emigration policies.
"Previously, there were only small nuclei of Dominicans established in New York City," said Franc Baez, a sociologist at the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo. "When the big push came, Dominicans followed the Puerto Ricans there, and New York became the place par excellence to build a migratory utopia."
According to a survey cited in Patricia Pessar's book "Visa for a Dream," a study of Dominicans in the United States, 9,330 Dominicans came to this country annually in the early 1960's, nearly 10 times as many as in the 1950's. There are now around 750,000 legal and illegal Dominicans living in the five boroughs, largely concentrated in Washington Heights and the western Bronx. In most parts of the Dominican Republic it is hard to find anyone without at least one relative in New York.
 
Images of New York: 'Dollars in the Street'
How do Dominicans on the island view the faraway city that looms so large in their lives and their imaginations?
Sitting in the library of the Universidad Catolica Madre y Maestra, Rosanna Luciano described her first childhood impressions of New York. When she left the Dominican Republic at age 9 to visit relatives in Washington Heights, her older brother made an intriguing request. "Rosanna," he said, "bring me back all the dollars you find in the street there." She still remembers walking around Manhattan with her eyes glued to the ground.
Ms. Luciano, now 19, is studying to be a dentist and is no longer so gullible. She has heard repeatedly how hard immigrants must work in New York, how little they are paid, how bad discrimination can be. Yet she still plans to move to New York to join her boyfriend in Inwood when she graduates, despite the language and licensing barriers that may prevent her from practicing her profession.
She is not alone. Even for many professionals, the image of New York as the land of opportunity has survived the negative publicity. It's not difficult to understand why: many Dominican doctors could quadruple their salaries by becoming livery cab drivers in the Bronx.
For poorer Dominicans like Jose Rafael Gomez and his wife, Trinidad Sanchez, New York can be a lifeline. The couple, coffee and avocado farmers in a rural town, Salitres de Moca, don't earn enough to support the eight grandchildren and other relatives who live with them. So they depend on the generosity of their five daughters in the Bronx and New Jersey, who wire them several hundred dollars a month. "We're eating every day because of our daughters," Mrs. Sanchez said. "God bless them."
Mr. Gomez thinks his hard-working daughters are thriving in New York.
"They have changed their system of living and their physical appearance as well," he said, and he describes them as glowing when they return for a visit. "To me, New York is a great country."
Hipolito Melendez, a merchant familiar with both worlds, has a far less complimentary view. Mr. Melendez, who is in his 40's, lives in Villa Trina, a picturesque farming and cabinetmaking hill town up the road from Salitres de Moca. In 1988 he traveled illegally to New York via Central America, finally crossing the border in Tijuana before heading for New York City. He spent two years working 13-hour shifts in a Washington Heights bodega for $200 a week, sharing a cramped rented room in the western Bronx with a cousin. He saved nothing.
Since returning home in 1990, he speaks freely about his experience to friends and neighbors, calling New York "a disaster" and swearing he will never return.
"People think it's the apex," he said. "People say, 'If I can get there. . . .' But 'there' is very difficult." He realizes that his words mean little in a town where most barely scrape by. "If there was an opportunity to leave," he acknowledged, "all Villa Trina would go. Except for me."
Mr. Melendez may be exaggerating, but not by much. A 1997 Gallup-Hoy poll found that more than half of adult Dominicans would emigrate if they had the chance, a vast majority citing economic motivations. (Older and more financially stable Dominicans were less likely to want to go.) Strict American immigration laws restrict entry to people with specific job skills or with close relatives who are United States citizens or legal permanent residents.
Even then, there is often a long wait and a difficult interview process. Some Dominican siblings of American citizens, the lowest-ranked preference category, have been waiting 11 years for an interview.
 
'New York Is Hard, My Country Is Hard'
In practically every working-class corner of Santo Domingo, the beat of merengue pounds from homes, nightclubs and corner stores known as colmados. Dominicans of all ages listen, usually at astoundingly high volume. The lyrics often explore political and social themes of Dominican life, and a frequent topic is the Dominican exodus to New York and the success or heartbreak it can bring.
"Merengue has been at the forefront of the effort to document migration," said Silvio Torres-Saillant, the director of the CUNY Dominican Studies Institute at City College, noting that the first songs about Dominicans who went to New York appeared before scholars began studying the issue.
The 1995 hit "A Day in New York," by the Hermanos Rosario (the Rosario Brothers) documents the downside of immigrant life for Dominicans. In the song, which saturated Dominican airwaves for months, an out-of-work Dominican New Yorker describes a typical day in the Bronx to a friend back home. He scans the want ads in vain, is told by the superintendent that the pipes have burst, gets a parking ticket and witnesses a machine-gun killing. At the end of the song, he asks if his friend still wants to come to New York. "I love the warmth of my land," is the reply.
Two songs released this year by the group Oro Duro (Hard Gold) reflect the internal conflicts that characterize Dominican views of New York. The first, "Nueva York 'Ta Duro" ("New York Is Hard") describes the difficulty of life in the city, citing harsh welfare reforms, high rents and parking tickets. In the sequel, "Mi Pais 'Ta Duro" ("My Country Is Hard"), the singer describes returning to Santo Domingo after two years, only to be overwhelmed by the poverty, blackouts and epidemics that caused him to leave in the first place. The only feasible option, he concludes, is to move to the moon.
In another merengue, the popular group Cocoband describes a common ritual that takes place when a relative arrives from New York with suitcases full of gifts.
Everyone congratulates you, when you come from over there,
He came with seven suitcases, the man arrived loaded . . .
What has New York got, that makes everyone look so good?
And what did you bring me?
A pair of sneakers.
And what did you bring me?
A polo shirt.
And what did you bring me?
Two boxes of corn flakes.
But some Dominicans borrow money to fill those suitcases; others rent jewelry to project an image of success. "They'll come back to New York totally broke," said Greta Gilbertson, a professor of sociology at Fordham University who studies Dominican migration to New York, "but they've fulfilled their social obligation."
 
The Returnees: 'Dominican Yorks'
Dominicans who return to Santo Domingo to live are known as "Dominican Yorks." Some come back with enough money to settle comfortably, rising several rungs on the socioeconomic ladder upon their return. Others have simply tired of the United States. Still others might be children sent back by the parents for disciplinary or academic reasons. Some who have never left see the Dominican Yorks as further proof that the city means success; others consider their ostentatious behavior reprehensible, proof that living in New York corrupts values.
In the 1980's, a particularly pretentious category of Dominican Yorks captured the spotlight. They were known as "cadenuses" because of the heavy gold chains (in Spanish, cadenas) they wore that linked them in people's minds with New York's illegal drug trade.
Alberto Escoto, a Dominican factory worker who moved to the Bronx with his family in 1992 and now lives near Yankee Stadium, remembers the influences the brazen returnees had on young Dominicans in Villa Duarte, the poor sector of the capital where he grew up. "They came from New York with a lot of money," he said. "They stood on the corner, treating people to beers, handing out 500-peso bills to show the neighborhood they had power. People would mob them, saying give me this, give me that."
Dominican Yorks sometimes lead double lives, spending part of the year in New York and the rest in the Dominican Republic. Sociologists call such a way of life transnationalism, and attribute its recent rise to technological advances in communication and transportation. Although transnationalism is increasingly common among many immigrant groups, it is particularly resonant for Dominicans, whose native land is even closer and often cheaper to fly to than California.
Aura Fernandez leads a typical transnational life style. She lives part of the year with her three brothers in Downtown Brooklyn, where she does seasonal factory work, and spends the rest with her husband and children in Juma, a rural village. Signs of Dominican York abound in her tidy island home: new appliances, a Toyota Camry in a town where cars are exceedingly rare, a HIP health plan T-shirt drying on a stone wall in the backyard.
She is seeking so-called green cards, residency cards, for her family. When permission is granted, she and her husband will decide whether to relocate permanently. Their two sons and their stepdaughter are "dying to go," Ms. Fernandez said. The family's prosperity has influenced the neighbors' children as well. Mercedita Vallejo and her brother Fermin want to emigrate, but their only relative in New York is an undocumented older brother.
Some Dominicans are repelled by what they consider the decadence of many Dominican Yorks. Luis Manuel Lora of Santiago, a member of a working-class family who attends the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo, was shocked when an 11-year-old acquaintance returned home, asked Luis whether he smoked, suggested that he get an earring and demanded to know whether he was still a virgin.
Nowhere is disdain for Dominican Yorks more prominent than among those who stayed and did well. Victor Perez, 37, who grew up poor, now works as a banker, living comfortably in Santiago. Like many other professionals who struggled to make it at home, he says that in his opinion returnees took the easy way out.
"Even if they have money, they have no education," Mr. Perez said. "When a nonimmigrant Dominican looks for an apartment or builds a house, he wants to see who his neighbors are going to be, to make sure there are no Dominican Yorks."
 
Risking Their Lives On a Rickety 'Titanic'
In Miches, a quiet fishing town on the northeast coast where every other street light is burned out and packs of stray dogs roam the streets after midnight, the imprint of migration is everywhere. In the town square, Amanda Linares, 14, sucks the juice from a stalk of sugar cane and adjusts her Yankee cap. Her mother, who lives in New York, recently filed the paperwork for Amanda to join her.
At one of the city's money exchange agencies, between $3,000 and $4,000 arrives daily, a small part of the $1.5 billion that comes into the country annually from immigrants in the United States but "a big chunk of change here in Miches," said Gricelda Reyes, who works in the office.
At the Amparo Bakery, a group of men sit on plastic chairs drinking Presidente beer. They include Fernando Amparo, who spent eight years in New Jersey and New York and returned with $5,000 to run the family bakery-cafeteria; Elvis Pimentel, who grew up in the Bronx and is in town for six months visiting relatives; and Rafael Candelaria, the local district attorney, who has never been to the United States. Speaking a fluid mixture of Bronx street English and proper Dominican Spanish, they flip the channels on the television set between a National Hockey League game and ESPN.
The biggest sign of immigration here is the yolas. Miches is best known as a departure point for the rickety wooden boats that transport Dominicans across the shark-inhabited waters of the Mona Passage to Puerto Rico, where many continue to New York. Despite stepped-up enforcement by local authorities, Dominicans from throughout the country descend on Miches, paying up to $1,000 to risk their lives to enter the United States illegally. Mr. Candelaria remembers one large vessel nicknamed "the Titanic," an allusion to both its size and possible fate. No one knows just how many people drown on yola trips, but almost everyone agrees the number is significant.
Jose Manuel Fabian, 30, a driver of a motorcycle taxi, has spent his life savings on four unsuccessful trips from Miches. The fourth time the yola went off course, and 120 passengers spent eight days at sea before they were picked up and returned home. He spent three days in the hospital recovering from dehydration. Yet he would go again tomorrow, he says, "even if New York was breaking into pieces."
 
The Other Side, Looking Back
Dominicans who immigrate typically romanticize their home country as much as they once romanticized New York. Dominican businesses are frequently named after their owners' hometowns. Dominican newspapers are flown in daily. The word "alla" literally means "there," but is used as a synonym for "Santo Domingo." A few weeks ago, La Banda Gorda released a merengue, "Aqui, pero alla" ("Here but There"), which, despite its upbeat rhythm, captures the longing felt by so many.
I'm here, but my mind is there,
And I don't lose hope that one day I will return
I had to leave my country in search of a future
I came loaded with dreams, but they died here
It wasn't as I thought, or how I imagined
My people are so different, I want to go back.

The main front-page article in this section last Sunday, about perceptions of New York City in the Dominican Republic, misstated the number of daily flights from there to New York on American Airlines. The figure of "about 30 flights a day" to Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark Airports includes trips that require connecting flights. On a typical day American has five nonstop flights from the Dominican Republic to Kennedy and two others that make one intermediate stop.

HEADLINE: BEHIND THE WHEEL/2000 Toyota Echo;
An Odd Lesson in College Economics

BYLINE: By DAN LIENERT 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
AFTER pulling me over at 1:30 a.m. on a recent Thursday, Trooper Antone Wilson of the Massachusetts State Police offered an enthusiastic, Bostonian "How ah yah?" followed by a more pointed question: "Is this car gas or electric?"
The new-for-2000 Toyota Echo had caught the eye of Trooper Wilson as I drove down Commonwealth Avenue. He had stopped me to discuss the car's merits. 
 What's going on here? Sure, police officers might flag down a Plymouth Prowler for a closer look, but why would they even notice an entry-level Toyota like this two-door Echo, a car that shares subcompact status with nearly invisible appliances like the Hyundai Accent and the Daewoo Lanos?
Because the Echo stands out in the cluttered bargain basement of the new-car market. The small Toyota is unusual in several ways, but its unorthodox styling makes it impossible to ignore.
Undeniably, the Echo makes a statement. But just what is it saying?
Trooper Wilson, who appeared to be in his 30's, is a bit older than the Echo's target market: 20-somethings like me and my friends. Toyota expects the car to generate a buzz on campuses; to test this premise, I, a 20-year-old Harvard University student, took the keys for a week. I loaded an Echo with my friends and drove around Boston, the higher-education capital of the world, seeking the opinions of other students.
Some liked it. Some didn't. But everybody -- and I mean everybody -- had something to say about the Echo's design.
For instance, Amanda Gill, a Harvard junior from Atlanta, said the car looked "insectlike" and "buggish." Indeed, with its stunted front end and awkwardly high roof, the Echo looks as if someone had pushed it into a wall. Oddly enough, many spectators found the quirky design charming.
Sean Boyland, 19, a Boston native, called the car "unapologetic and fun" -- a characteristic that may limit its appeal to conservative car shoppers. "No one will know what to make of this," Mr. Boyland said.
Jay Chaffin, 21, an actor from Hammonton, N.J., was flabbergasted, particularly by the pinched-looking front end. "If this car were a dog," he said, "it would be a pug."
John D. Couriel, a 21-year-old from Miami who plans to attend law school, was lukewarm, too, but gave the Echo a closer look when told of its economic virtues.
With a base price of $9,995 (plus a destination charge of $455), territory usually reserved for somewhat unpolished Korean imports, the Echo calls out to cost-conscious buyers. The car particularly stands out because of the specificity with which Toyota has singled out young consumers.
Don Esmond, group vice president and general manager of the Toyota Division, said the Echo was "the first in a line of new vehicles being developed by Toyota to appeal to the specific, distinct demands of younger new-car buyers." The car is being heavily promoted on the World Wide Web, and the percentage of its advertising budget that goes to network television is unusually low -- just 30 percent, compared with 70 percent for other Toyota products.
 So what, in particular, should put the Echo on the shopping lists of students and other newly licensed drivers? Here are a few compelling reasons:
 
* Its price. At a range of $10,450 to $14,200, the car's low cost of admission is its single defining characteristic.
 
* Its brand name. Toyota's sterling reputation for quality should give the Echo an edge over low-priced rivals from the likes of Kia, Daewoo, Hyundai and maybe even Chevrolet and Dodge. On the quality front, only the Honda Civic -- and possibly, the Ford Focus, though it's too soon to tell -- have as strong an image.
 
* Its space. With a cabin that is exceptionally vertical, the Echo is truly roomy for up to four people. With 39.9 inches of headroom in front and 37.6 in the back, my 6-foot-2 frame fit comfortably in every seat, a feat unequaled in two-door Cavaliers, Civics, Saturns and Mitsubishi Mirages.
 
* Its performance. The Echo is solid in every way, easily surpassing the low expectations raised by its price. The 16-valve four-cylinder engine is small -- just 1.5 liters -- but it has a sophisticated design unequaled at the price, with dual overhead cams and variable valve timing for high efficiency and steady delivery of power. It puts out a respectable 108 horsepower, and with a five-speed manual transmission its pep should disappoint no one shopping in this class.
 
* Its fuel economy. The mileage rating (34 city, 41 highway, according to Environmental Protection Agency estimates) is among the best for gasoline-powered cars.
 
* Its ride and handling. The body is tight and very quiet, with light, user-friendly steering. What the car may lack in world-class manners -- its turning circle and suspension are adequate, at best -- it makes up for with its maneuverable size and enough zip to get out of a jam.
True, only a lapse in judgment would cause anyone to drive in Boston, but the Echo was nimble enough to easily negotiate the Hub's roads, which are straight out of the 17th century, and compensate for its drivers, who are straight out of "A Clockwork Orange."
And the Echo is certainly easier to parallel-park than those sport-utility vehicles with which my generation is so preoccupied.
The Echo makes another compelling case for itself from within, with a cabin that is nearly as eccentric as the exterior design. The interior has a clean, spartan feel. I don't know if the minimalist interior design was determined by aesthetics or by cost-cutting. (Is the center-mounted speedometer there for looks or to reduce the expense of converting the car from right-hand drive?) But the design works in a way that is appealing without feeling bare.
Perhaps this is because the Echo makes substantial allowances for a defining feature of my generation: our stuff. Toyota has riddled the car with storage spaces, including large door pockets, bins for tapes and CD's all around the audio system, dual cup holders in front and back, and an especially neat clamshell glovebox that opens in two parts to reveal two shelves.
Despite a $1,020 upgrade package on the model I tested -- with options, the sticker price was $12,945 -- comforts like power mirrors, windows and locks were missing.
Small-car shoppers will, no doubt, stack the Echo up against the Focus. Both represent new and unconventional efforts in a fairly boring market; both are high and deceptively spacious inside, with large windows that provide excellent visibility, and both ride and drive better than the run of the small-car pack. The more expensive Focus does have a slight performance edge, with its larger engine and tighter handling, and it has more standard features -- some for the young, like a CD player on the ZX3 and ZTS models, and some for the grown-up, like a tachometer. Not only that, the Focus alone offers side air bags for an extra $350.
Although Toyota disappoints by offering only an AM-FM stereo on the stripper model, buyers can toss in an extra $170 and get a cassette deck and six quite decent speakers.
So far, the Echo-Focus race is too close to call. But it is fair to say that the Echo's ride and comfort are among the best in this class. And the bottom line is that this is a solid car for a low price. So the appeal of the Echo comes back to design, and a subjective question: Does the look work for you?
Young people here seemed willing to at least give the Echo a chance. This would seem to be less a result of Toyota's explicit marketing to them than of the price. Given the poverty levels of most people my age, demand for the car will ultimately rest on its value, which is considerable.
 Let's put it this way: I'm 20 years old, and my interest in the Echo would be strictly economic. I wouldn't say the car looks or feels particularly young, despite Toyota's concerted efforts to present it as a car for the "Net generation," and the company's marketing reliance on the Internet.
Still, the styling of the Echo is unconventional for the explicit purpose of appealing to a younger market. At some points, Toyota goes a little over the top. One choice for exterior color is Absolutely Red. As opposed to what? Somewhat Red?
The opinions of friends and passersby confirm that although the Echo is eye-catching, it's not necessarily hip. "I've never seen a car like that before," said David Joffe, 21, a Harvard student from New York. "And I hope I never do again."
 
INSIDE TRACK: Screwball or savvy? The Echo looks like a little of both.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
Phoenix

BYLINE: By SUZANNE WINCKLER; SUZANNE WINCKLER, who lives in Mesa, writes about natural history.

 BODY:
Winter in the Valley of the Sun is nearing, with its limpid blue skies, opalescent sunsets, cool starry nights and balmy days. No wonder people from the higher latitudes, burdened by subzero wind chills, icy roads and gray days, flock to Phoenix and its sister cities from November to April.
The valley is a sprawling amalgam of a dozen or so communities that budded in barren desert and then spread, thanks to ever more steady supplies of water pumped from underground or siphoned from other places. What looks like a seamless urbanscape from the air is in fact a handful of cities bumping up against each other. 
 Five of them -- Phoenix, Scottsdale, Tempe, Glendale and Mesa -- took root in the 1870's. More than 100 years later, each remains distinct, and their differences make the valley ripe for exploration. Mesa and Glendale, are family towns, while Scottsdale is tony and Tempe, home to Arizona State University, is laid back. Phoenix runs the gamut from urban chic to quiet bungalow neighborhoods.
The unifying chord through these communities is an obsession with water. Today, 1,265 miles of canals shunt it through the valley from reservoirs on the Salt and Verde Rivers, as well from the Colorado. With all this water, the 2.8 million citizens of the valley have created an emerald-green city of grass and swaying palms, where most public spaces -- museums, shopping centers, hotels -- have some sort of babbling sculpture, fountain or sluice.
 
Events
The season's blockbuster at the Phoenix Art Museum, 1625 North Central Avenue, is "Monet at Giverny," which includes 22 large paintings from the Musee Marmottan in Paris, through Jan. 2. Advance ticket purchase is recommended, from (480) 503-5555 locally or (800) 638-4253; tickets are $12 and $6 for children 6 to 12, plus a service charge of a dollar or two.
For a more Southwestern flavor, the museum has "Taos Artists and Their Patrons: 1898-1950," Dec. 18 through March 5. This exhibition offers nearly 100 works by Georgia O'Keeffe, Walter Ufer, Victor Higgins and Ernest Blumenschein, among others. The museum is open daily except Monday. General admission is $7, $5 for ages 65 and up and students, $2 for ages 6 to 18; free on Thursdays. Information: (602) 257-1222 or www.phxart.org.
The Heard Museum, 2301 North Central Avenue, houses the American Indian collections of Dwight and Maie Bartlett Heard, a couple who settled in the Valley in 1895. The museum's Spanish Colonial-style building is on what was their estate, in the historic Los Olivos neighborhood, north of downtown Phoenix. Through March 19, "Powerful Images: Portrayals of Native America" combines pop culture and Indian art to examine contemporary Indian culture, with contributions from 10 North American museums. The museum is open daily. Admission is $7, $6 for ages 65 and up, $3 for ages 4 to 12; (602) 252-8848.
First Fridays, a program of self-guided tours of art galleries and studios in downtown Phoenix, is held from 6 to 10 p.m. on the first Friday of the month from October through June. The next one is this Friday. Information from Artlink, (602) 256-7539.
Las Noches de las Luminarias, Thursday through Saturday at the Desert Botanical Garden, 1201 North Galvin Parkway, is a nocturnal holiday tradition in Phoenix. Visitors stroll along candlelighted pathways through a weirdly wonderful desert scape of saguaro, ocotillo and palo verde and mesquite trees while musicians perform from 5:30 to 9:30 p.m. Tickets, which must be bought in advance, are $12.50, $4 ages 5 to 12. Information: (480) 754-8188.
International Christmas, at the Bank One Center, 201 North Central Avenue in downtown Phoenix, offers treats for the kids. This free festival runs everyday from 8 A.M. to 9 P.M., today through Dec. 30. The centerpieces are 45 decorated trees, representing 45 ethnic cultures from the area, and choral concerts the first two weeks. On Dec. 4, there will be a concert, puppet show and ornament making; (602) 221-1005.
The Phoenix Open, Jan. 24 to 30, billed as the world's best-attended golf tournament (more than 400,000 spectators are expected during the week), is played on the Stadium Course of the Tournament Players Club of Scottsdale, 17020 North Hayden Road, Scottsdale. Although the field has not been set, last year's competitors included Tiger Woods and Justin Leonard. Tickets are $20 a day. Information: (602) 870-4431.
Horses probably rank next to golf as the most popular diversion in the valley. In Scottsdale, WestWorld Equestrian Center, 16601 North Pima Road, has sales, exhibitions and competitions, including the United States Team Roping Championships, Dec. 31 to Jan 2. Most events are free. Information: (480) 312-6802.
 
Sightseeing
With the moderate temperatures from November through April, the best way to get a lay of the land is to park your car and start walking. More than 90 hiking trails weave through metropolitan Phoenix, and AZ Trails, at www.azcentral.com /travel/hiking, has listings that include distances, difficulty and directions.
Among the choices is the Summit Trail on Squaw Peak, (602) 262-7901, a fairly strenuous 2.4-mile round trip, that provides a panoramic view of the city. The Waterfall Canyon Trail in the White Tank Mountains, (623) 935-2505, west of the city, is an easy two-mile trip that goes past Indian petroglyphs carved into boulders on the way to an 80-foot waterfall; much of this trail is accessible by wheelchair.
The 1983 Guide to Architecture of Metro Phoenix, though a tad outdated, is the best introduction to the valley's urban history. It costs $5 from the Central Arizona Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, 802 North Fifth Avenue; (602) 257-1925. The chapter is just north of downtown near several classic 1920's and 30's neighborhoods, including Encanto-Palmcroft, Willo and Coronado. These areas are living museums of such styles as Mission Revival, California Bungalow, Craftsman Bungalow, Art Moderne and International Style.
The palm-tree-lined campus of Arizona State University in Tempe offers a sleek modern setting for people watching. The most avant-garde of the buildings is the A.S.U. Art Museum, Mill Avenue and 10th Street, an Egyptian-looking vault of shimmering pink stucco designed by Antoine Predock. Regardless of what is on display, it's a joy to walk through the subterranean walkway adorned with sculpture and the three levels of large white, echoy galleries; (480) 965-2787.
A glimpse into the future lies a mile west of the campus, at University Avenue and McClintock Drive, where Arizona Public Service's Solar Test and Research (STAR) Center is testing photovoltaic technology. The more than two dozen mirrored contraptions of various sizes and shapes glinting in the sun are beautiful to behold as you drive by. For tours, call (602) 250-4990.
 
Where to Stay
The 107-room Best Western Executive Park Downtown, 1100 North Central Avenue, (602) 252-2100, fax (602) 340-1989, is quiet, comfortable and convenient to museums and other central-city attractions. There is a restaurant, lounge, pool, sauna and exercise area, and in-room modems. Doubles average $110.
Budget: The Tempe Days Inn, 1221 East Apache Boulevard, (480) 968-7793, fax (480) 966-4450, has 102 rooms and is close to the Arizona State campus. Doubles run from $59 in the summer, to $99 in winter.
The Econolodge Scottsdale, 6935 East Fifth Avenue, (480) 994-9461, fax (480) 947-1695, is in the heart of Old Town, an area of shops, restaurants and galleries. It has 92 rooms, with doubles ranging from a summer low of $49 to $94 in February.
Luxury: The Arizona Biltmore Resort and Spa, 24th Street and Missouri Avenue, (800) 950-0086, fax (602) 381-7600, is cloistered within the 1,000-acre Arizona Biltmore Estates at the end of a long and winding road. Designed by Albert Chase McArthur, with assistance from Frank Lloyd Wright, it is a grand, rambling ghost-gray palace with a stark, cool lobby and spare Mission-style furniture. Of the 730 rooms, 120 are in a new wing that opened this month, less than two years after the resort built a spa and fitness area. There are eight swimming pools (including the original Catalina pool, with its gorgeous multicolored tiles), seven tennis courts, a croquet lawn and a chess board with three-foot-tall pieces. Doubles start at $315 now, and winter rates will run from $330 for a double to $1,695 for a two-bedroom villa suite.
In Carefree, 12 miles north of Scottsdale, the Boulders, 34631 North Tom Darlington Drive, (800) 553-1717, fax (480) 488-4118, is a 1,300-acre retreat surrounded by two golf courses and the desert. Guests stay in their own little casitas, each with a deck and fireplace supplied with aromatic shaggy-bark juniper. There are five restaurants and three swimming pools. Rates: $185 in summer to $565 from Jan. 16 to April 29.
 
Where to Eat
Cafe Terra Cotta, 6166 North Scottsdale Road, in the Borgata Scottsdale shopping center, offers such neo-Southwestern dishes as pork tenderloin adobado, corn risotto and pepper filet cooked rare when the customer says rare. The wine list focuses on zinfandels, but numerous other wines and beers are available. Dinner for two with wine costs about $80. Open daily for lunch and dinner; reservations, recommended for evening weekends, at (480) 948-8100.
Marquesa, at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort, 7575 East Princess Drive, lies at the elegant extreme of dining in the Valley of the Sun. With indoor and patio seating, it specializes in generous portions of Catalan and Mediterranean food served by attentive waiters. Signature dishes include gazpacho, garlic soup and seafood paella. Dinner for two with cocktails and wine costs about $250. Open Tuesday through Saturday for dinner and Sunday for brunch. Reservations recommended, (480) 585-4848.
The Chuck Box, 202 East University Drive in Tempe, is the place for really big hamburgers, fries, onion rings and beer in mason jars. It prides itself on simple decor, with Arizona ranch and cowboy photos on the walls. A meal for two with beer costs about $15; (480) 968-4712.
Mrs. White's Golden Rule Cafe, 808 East Jefferson Street, is a downtown landmark, serving Southern-style plate lunches, including smothered chicken. Two can eat for less than $12. Open 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday; (602) 262-9256.
A fine and friendly example of the city's many family-owned Mexican restaurants is Los Picos, 1542 West University Drive in Mesa, which focuses on seafood dishes from Mexico's Pacific Coast, like Sinaloa-style coctel de camaron with shrimp, salsa, cucumber and avocado. Dinner for two with appetizer and beer costs about $30. Breakfast, lunch and dinner daily; (480) 833-4711.

HEADLINE: Shaping The Future In Seattle

BYLINE: By Bill Gates; Bill Gates is the chairman of Microsoft.

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
This week, representatives from more than 130 countries will gather here for a meeting that will help set the global economic agenda for years to come. The greater the success of this meeting at establishing fair and predictable conditions for expanded world trade, the better the future prospects not only for our own economy but for global prosperity.
The World Trade Organization is the principal organization dedicated to developing international trade rules, maintaining nations' access to one another's markets, resolving trade disputes and encouraging trade liberalization. This round of meetings will provide an important opportunity to explore ways that government, industry, interest groups and the public can work together to ensure the continued expansion of free, open and fair trade. 
 I became co-chairman of the Seattle host organization for this event because I believe that fair and open international trade is good not only for companies that depend on exports; it is good for the global economy and for opening up lines of communication and progress throughout the world.
Perhaps more than any other city in America, Seattle illustrates the benefits of global commerce. More than $34 billion in exports flow through our region's ports each year, making the Seattle-Tacoma region the nation's No. 1 exporter. One of every three jobs in Washington State is directly tied to international trade -- exports, imports or both -- and the figure is much higher in the Seattle area itself. Our region is vivid proof that trade creates jobs and bolsters wages, stimulates economic growth, expands consumer choice and ultimately increases productivity and competitiveness.
At Microsoft, overseas sales of our software products totaled $10 billion last year, nearly two-thirds of our revenues. Another company in our region, Boeing, is America's largest exporter, shipping $30 billion in aircraft and other goods and services overseas last year. A third, Weyerhaeuser, shipped more than $1 billion in wood and wood products to 60 nations. And our region's farmers shipped nearly $2 billion in wheat, apples, livestock and other products to literally dozens of countries.
And Seattle's story is increasingly the nation's. The economic health of the United States as a whole is increasingly based on international trade. Thanks in part to lower trade barriers and strong exports, our economy is the strongest it has been in a generation. International trade can continue to drive domestic economic growth and job creation, so long as we have the appropriate global framework in place.
The World Trade Organization provides its member countries with exactly that: a forum for negotiating agreements that remove barriers to the free exchange of goods and services and for resolving trade disputes before nations take unilateral actions that could threaten millions of jobs and global economic progress. If the W.T.O. didn't exist, the nations of the world would have to invent it.
The recent agreement to bring China into the trade group has the potential to open new opportunities for American goods and services, ultimately benefiting the United States as well as China and the rest of the world. Those of us who helped arrange the conference hope significant strides will be made here to help bring this agreement closer to fruition, and we will continue to encourage Congress to ratify the agreement and support permanently improved trade relations with China.
Trade affects virtually every community and every industry, and high technology is no exception. The W.T.O. agenda includes a number of issues critical to the continued growth of the American high-tech industry, which now accounts for more than 8 percent of the American economy and one-third of our economic growth in recent years.
The high-technology industry supports creation of a "tariff-free zone" for economic transactions over the Internet, as well as other free-trade steps to encourage the growth of electronic commerce. We support consistent international rules for the electronic marketplace to give companies the confidence to invest and consumers the benefit of greater choice. And we encourage the trade organization to finish putting in place the international treaty for protection of intellectual property rights, which is fundamental to the continued strength of American technology companies.
In addition to providing a meeting place for the governmental delegations, Seattle expects visits from thousands of citizens and advocacy groups. Their concern emphasizes the effect that international commerce increasingly has on every aspect of our lives, from the environment and public health to education and international labor standards.
The Seattle meetings will provide opportunities for a wide range of viewpoints to be heard, and the W.T.O. needs to continue its efforts to open up the dialogue and provide more opportunity for citizens and advocacy groups to follow its work.
Regardless of one's view on any single issue, one fact cannot be disputed: The world we live in is changing. Borders and barriers are coming down; actions in one corner of the world will affect people around the globe. The World Trade Organization will play a vital role as we learn to adapt to a new world economy.

Gifts for Celebrating the Century or Just Relaxing

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT 

 BODY:
Well, they finally did it. The publisher Benedikt Taschen has issued a book called "Sumo," a collection of photographs by Helmut Newton, edited by his wife, June Newton. Which may sound innocent enough. But here's the thing: it's 465 pages long, measures 20 by 28 by 4 inches, weighs 66 pounds and comes with its own chromed stainless-steel folding table designed by Philippe Starck. So the dream of Seinfeld's Kramer of a coffee-table book that is actually a coffee table has been all but realized.
Because "Sumo" bears a price tag of $1,500, a review copy was understandably not sent to this office. I therefore can't recommend it as a gift this season. But the following books, arranged by ascending price, will do very well in its place. 
 INTERNET COOL GUIDE, edited by Rula Razek. Designed by Tika Buchanan and James Tung of Eric Baker Design Associates, N.Y. (187 pages. Te Neues Publishing Company. Paperback, $14.95.) O.K., so this guide to the 1,000 best Web sites will probably be obsolete by the day after tomorrow. But in the meantime there's lots of useful advice here on search engines and how to use them for everything from buying a car online to playing chess against Gary Kasparov. And you can get updates on www.internetcoolguide.com.
HOME COMFORTS: The Art and Science of Keeping House, by Cheryl Mendelson. Illustrations by Harry Bates. (884 pages. Scribner. $35.) A guide to all the domestic arts -- from choosing fabrics to folding sheets to mending book bindings to throwing out old documents -- by an articulate, witty woman who is a philosopher, lawyer, sometime professor and a homemaker, wife and mother all rolled into one.
SAVEUR COOKS AUTHENTIC FRENCH, by the editors of Saveur Magazine. Designed by Jill Armus, Michael Grossman and Amy Henderson. (320 pages. Chronicle Books. $40.) This sequel to last year's "Saveur Cooks Authentic American" explores the traditions of French cuisine -- particularly those of Burgundy, Alsace, the Southwest, Provence and a few others -- and is packed with illustrations that look good enough to . . . well, send you out looking for truffles, duck's liver and frog's legs.
FULL MOON, by Michael Light. Essay by Andrew Chaikin. (Unpaged. Alfred A. Knopf. $50.) In case you haven't gone there yet, these magnificent two-page (and occasionally four-page) spreads, newly released by NASA, capture the visual sensation of landing on, walking around and taking off from the mysteriously beautiful landscape of the Moon. Published on the 30th anniversary of Apollo II, the first moon voyage, it answers some of the questions posed by Les Paul and Mary Ford in the song "How High the Moon?"
Looking in another direction, namely back over the last hundred years, the following four volumes view the 20th century from multiple perspectives. The first -- CENTURY: One Hundred Years of Human Progress, Regression, Suffering and Hope, conceived and edited by Bruce Bernard (1,120 pages; Phaidon Press; $49.95) -- is a history told in more than 1,100 photographs, many familiar, some never before published. The juxtapositions are often shocking -- President John F. Kennedy at a street party in Ireland across from the moment of the second Oswald shot -- and remind you that these truly have been the best and worst of times. The next two -- THE AMERICAN CENTURY: Art and Culture 1900-1950; by Barbara Haskell (408 pages; $60) and THE AMERICAN CENTURY: Art and Culture 1950-2000, by Lisa Phillips (398 pages; $60; both published by the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, in association with W. W. Norton) -- offer rich records of the recent shows at the Whitney, considering American art as a response to political, social and economics conditions, and tracing its expression in painting, sculpture, photography, architecture, film, literature, dance, theater, music and the decorative arts. And finally, THE LOOK OF THE CENTURY, by Michael Tambini (288 pages; DK Publishing; $39.95), a striking visual record of how changes in taste have been reflected in everything from furniture to cereal boxes, from Coca-Cola bottles to the Porsche 911.
As always the Bronx is up and the Battery's down in NEW YORK: An Illustrated History; narrative by Ric Burns and James Sanders; picture editor, Lisa Ades (575 pages; Alfred A. Knopf; $60) and NEW YORK 1880: Architecture and Urbanism in the Gilded Age, by Robert A. M. Stern, Thomas Mellins and David Fishman (1,164 pages; Monacelli Press; $85). But the first, a companion to the PBS television series, also shows the city from its beginnings to the present, while the second concentrates on a period of great technological change that transformed the city from a harbor town to a world-class metropolis.
WOMEN. Photographs by Annie Leibovitz. Essay by Susan Sontag. (239 pages. Random House. $75.) The haunting images in this mesmerizing book show women in such astonishing variety that no cliche or generalization about the sex will ever again suffice.
Here are two volumes filled with waters so beautiful that one finds it hard to understand how anyone could resist the sport of fishing. The first, TROUT AND SALMON. Photography by R. Valentine Atkinson (176 pages; Lyons Press; $39.95), sends you all over the world: to Ireland, Chile, Norway and Russia, among other places ridden with magnificent fish. The second, LAND OF LITTLE RIVERS: A Story in Photos of Catskill Fly Fishing, by Austin McK. Francis; photography by Enrico Ferorelli (279 pages; Beaverkill Press; distributed by W. W. Norton. $100), zeroes in on the birthplace of American fly fishing and shows you not only fish and waters but also the people and equipment that helped to develop a great sport.
AFRICAN CEREMONIES, by Carol Beckwith and Angela Fisher. (Two volumes slip-cased: Vol. 1, 384 pages; Vol. 2, 360 pages. Harry N. Abrams, $150.) A monumental survey in pictures and text of tribal rituals, rites and ceremonies across the entire continent, spanning the human life cycle, birth, puberty, courtship and marriage, illness and death. Arresting views, often forbidden to outsiders, into the heart of humanity.
THE BEST OF FLAIR. Edited by Fleur Cowles. Foreword by Dominick Dunne. (337 pages. Rizzoli International Publications. Boxed, $250.) Remember Flair magazine (which ran for 12 months, February 1950 to January 1951), with its elegant design and its accordion foldouts once celebrated in a New Yorker cartoon showing a reader with an extra arm and hand, and its reputation for being either too lavish or too far ahead of its time? You don't? Well, here's the best of it, with prose by Winston Churchill, George Bernard Shaw and Tallulah Bankhead, among others, and with lots of pages to keep your two hands busy. In a bright red folding box that will look great on the coffee table even if you never crack it open.
And a happy holiday.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Waiting for 2000, wondering if the economy will keep surging and watching for Fed signals.

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer 

 BODY:
WITH about a month left in the millennium, the three major stock indexes are poised to record annual returns of more than 10 percent each for the fifth year in a row -- an unprecedented streak.
But the wealth generated by the indexes' gains may also pose the biggest threat to a repeat performance in 2000. 
 If the indexes keep rising, some economists argue, the stock market will continue to fuel consumer spending. Such buying makes it unlikely that the economy, which surged at a 5.5 percent annual growth rate in the third quarter, will slow enough to satisfy Federal Reserve policy makers. The Fed will then be forced to raise short-term interest rates, adding to its three quarter-point increases since June. And higher rates could spook equity investors if they conclude that the economy and earnings growth will finally slow significantly.
"If the stock market continues to go up at the rate we have had in the last couple of months, the Fed will be unhappy and raise interest rates," said Stephen D. Slifer, the chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers.
The Dow Jones industrial average has jumped almost 1,000 points, or 9.7 percent, in six weeks. In the same period, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks is up 13.6 percent , while the Nasdaq index has surged 26.2 percent. In light holiday trading Friday, the Dow slipped 19.26 points to 10,988.91, while the S.& P. 500 fell 0.46 point, to 1,416.62. But the Nasdaq rose 27.31 points to a new high of 3,447.81.
Stocks were higher earlier in the day after the government reported that personal income jumped 1.3 percent in October, the largest monthly gain in five-and-a-half years.
Mr. Slifer suspects that these rallies have given a new impetus to consumer spending and housing construction, and in turn may reverse the slight slowing in economic growth that was reflected in flat retail sales in September and October, a slowdown in automobile sales those months and a plunge in new home sales in September.
While he cannot be sure yet, he sees possible signs of new economic vigor in the jump in the consumer confidence index back to its recent highs and the return to the highs of this summer in the home purchase index.
"While we are seeing a few signs of slower growth right now," he said, "if these new signals are right, we will see faster growth a couple of months down the road."
Because of this, he said, he is tempted to raise his already strong outlook of 4.3 percent growth for the fourth quarter and is considering the addition of a Fed rate increase to his year 2000 forecast. He had expected the increase earlier this month to be the last for the near future.
Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch & Company, has already added a Fed rate increase to his forecast. "I think the economy is going to remain strong through all of next year," he said.
Since the Fed raised its interest rate target on federal funds, which is the rate banks lend money to one another overnight, a quarter of a percentage point to 5.5 percent on Nov. 16, bond investors have worried about the persistent strength in the economy and the possibility of more rate increases. But stock investors do not appear to have skipped a beat.
The divergence in views is obvious in the markets' performance. Since then, the Nasdaq index has moved to six new highs, the S.& P. 500 to two and the Dow, until Friday, was back to more than 11,000 points the first time since Sept. 13.
But the bond market has sold off. In a short day of trading Friday, the price of the 30-year bond fell 13/32 , while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.23 percent from 6.20 percent Wednesday and 6.02 percent the day before the Fed rate increase. The yield on the two-year note, which is more sensitive to the threat of a Fed rate move, rose Friday to 5.98 percent from 5.94 percent Wednesday and 5.75 percent before the Fed's action.
One factor that has blunted fears about a strong economy next year is the belief that the Federal Reserve's speed limit for acceptable growth has risen. While no one knows the actual number, analysts suspect it is about 3 percent to 3.5 percent, rather than the 2 percent to 2.5 percent of years past. The reason for the change is a sharp rise in productivity, which means workers are producing more goods at the same cost and keeping inflation pressures more subdued.
Mr. Steinberg expects the gross domestic product to grow 3.7 percent next year, while Mr. Slifer sees a more modest 3.4 percent. So the economy may attain an acceptable level without more rate increases.
But if growth in the fourth quarter comes in as expected at more than 4 percent, the pace of the last six months will be about 5 percent. And assuming that the economy will be easy to slow contradicts its performance over the last several years.
Fed policy makers signaled this problem in the statement that accompanied their last rate increase. "Despite tentative evidence of a slowing in certain interest-sensitive sectors of the economy and of accelerating productivity," they said, "the expansion of activity continues in excess of the economy's growth potential. As a consequence, the pool of available workers willing to take jobs has been drawn down further in recent months, a trend that must eventually be contained if inflationary imbalances are to remain in check and economic expansion continue."
Policy makers added that the three rate increases this year, along with the rise in market interest rates, "should markedly diminish the risk of inflation going forward."
Mr. Slifer, who has been confident that prices are in check, admits to "getting a tad nervous" as he looks at the recent rise in the prices of oil and new and used cars. "We are pushing this envelope as far as we can push it," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
The Super Bowl is attracting a crowd of new competitors.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott 

 BODY:
IF Beethoven were commissioned to rewrite his Fifth Symphony for Super Bowl XXXIV, he would undoubtedly begin this way: "Dot, dot, dot, com. Dot, dot, dot, com."
The mad scramble by Internet companies to increase recognition of their brand names by advertising in traditional media outlets will accelerate on Super Sunday, typically the biggest day of the year for Madison Avenue. Dot-coms are paying record prices -- an estimated average of more than $2 million for each 30-second commercial during the game, which is at least 25 percent higher than the 1999 rate -- to elbow their way into the ranks of mainstay Super Bowl advertisers like automobiles, beers, credit cards and soft drinks. 
 For the first time, a dot-com, the E*Trade Group, will even sponsor the halftime show, until now the province of purveyors of prosaic products like lunch meat.
"The dot-coms need to generate awareness and attention, to introduce themselves to the public, to get noticed by Wall Street," said Joe Mandese, editor of The Myers Report, a media industry newsletter. "What better way to do that than the ultimate advertising event?"
To be sure, the big gamble by the dot-coms that the exposure gained during the game on Jan. 30 will be worth the expense could be proved wrong. If the performance of their pitches is deemed sufficiently weak, what was intended as a shrewd business move could backfire badly. Not only might those dot-coms not be back for Super Bowl XXXV, they might not be in business by then either.
"There's going to be a major-league shakeout," said Gene DeWitt, president and chief executive at DeWitt Media in New York, which buys commercial time and ad space for advertisers.
"They all seem to have decided it's live or die, spending gobs of money," he added. "There's a kind of desperation to it."
Of the estimated 30 companies buying commercial time during the game, which will be broadcast by ABC, a dozen or so will be dot-coms. That is four times as many as last year. In fact, that is more than have appeared during all previous Super Bowls combined.
The estimated 125 million American viewers of Super Bowl XXXIV will see commercials for companies like Angeltips.com, Computer.com, Kforce.com, Ourbeginning.com, Pets.com and Screaming Media, all seeking to draw traffic to their Web sites or sell various online goods and services.
"The Super Bowl is the one time of the year when the viewers look forward to the commercials," said Jon Mandel, co-managing director at Mediacom in New York, the media services arm of Grey Advertising.
"It's a one-of-a-kind event," he added, "reaching everybody: men, women, children, pets. If you're trying to stand out, it's the place to be." Grey is creating a Super Bowl commercial for Kforce.com, a job search Web site owned by Romac International that is formally known as the Knowledge Force Network.
"It's a very intense, hyperconcentrated atmosphere for these companies, some of which you've heard of and some of which are coming in cold," said Ted Sann, co-chief executive and chief creative officer at BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group, which will create Super Bowl work for the Charles Schwab online brokerage division as well as advertisers without dots like Federal Express, PepsiCo and Visa.
"There's a potential for confusion because the dot-com category will be so cluttered, so they're going to have to differentiate themselves on the spot," he added. "If they don't have an execution that's incredibly good, absolutely riveting, they'll just be throwing the money away."
And what money it is. The estimated average of more than $2 million for each 30 seconds of commercial time compares with the estimated average of $1.6 million charged by the News Corporation's Fox Broadcasting unit for each 30-second spot during Super Bowl XXXIII.
"If ABC could add a fifth quarter, they'd do it," Mr. DeWitt said.
Because of the demand from dot-coms, as well as the overall strength of the advertising market, commercial time during the game is almost sold out, though nine weeks remain before kickoff. Reflecting that bull market, ABC is selling some of the last commercial slots left for prices estimated at $3 million each.
"The dot-coms recognize they need that quick and effective reach to drive people to their sites," said Marv Goldsmith, president for sales and marketing at the ABC Television Network in New York, part of the ABC unit of the Walt Disney Company. "And several are coming in on a competitive basis, reacting to each other."
For instance, besides the Kforce job search Web site, which is a newcomer to the Super Bowl, two other job-search sites are buying spots -- Hotjobs.com and Monster.com, part of TMP Worldwide. Both are returning from last year.
"It's obvious why we're back: the Super Bowl really worked for us," said Dean Harris, senior vice president for marketing at Hotjobs.com in New York. "It drew traffic to our site and grew our business."
But this year will be tougher. "Last year, people hadn't been asked to remember as many dot-com brands," said Edward Boches, chief creative officer at Mullen Advertising in Wenham, Mass., Monster.com's agency that is part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. "Now it won't be as easy as putting a name up on the screen with a dot-com after it."
"You're going to have to give people a real reason why, make them take a course of action," said Mr. Boches, whose agency is also creating a spot for Oxygen Media, a Web site and cable TV network aimed at women. "That puts more pressure on the advertising."
Julie Wainwright, chief executive at Pets.com in San Francisco, said, "You have to have a strategy, a point of differentiation." The commercial for Pets.com by the San Francisco office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of Omnicom, will emphasize the Web site's breadth of merchandise as well as its mascot, a sock-puppet dog.
The creative content of most dot-com commercials tends to be frenetic, cheeky, sometimes deliberately provocative, to help the spots stand out. That affects not only the other dot-coms but also other advertisers.
"When you know the commercials will be interesting, different, contemporary, exciting, it keeps you on your toes," said Tony Ponturo, vice president for media and sports marketing at Anheuser-Busch in St. Louis, which for the 12th consecutive year will be the exclusive beer advertiser during the Super Bowl. "It makes you lean forward and make sure you're sharp as well.
"Our estimates are that there's $500 million to $700 million of dot-com money in the marketplace," he added. "That's huge, more than the beer category."
If by some chance the commercials for brews like Budweiser and Bud Light fare poorly with viewers and critics on Jan. 30, Anheuser-Busch will open for business come Jan. 31. That may not be true for some dot-coms.
"There'll be smart money out there and there'll be dumb money out there," said Michael Sievert, vice president for marketing at E*Trade in Menlo Park, Calif. "Unlike the 'newbie' entrants in the dot-com marketing craze, our approach is investment, not expenditures.
"The dot-com clutter in some cases helps us because we're one of the top four e-commerce brands," he added. "The more focus and attention on the Internet space, the more focus and attention there is on the leaders." E*Trade will spend an estimated $3.8 million on its halftime show sponsorship and accompanying commercials by Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco, part of Omnicom.
"We all have a concern whether or not this pays off," acknowledged Jorge Cauz, senior vice president for Britannica.com in Chicago, which will run a Super Bowl spot created by Deutsch Inc. in New York. "But we feel we're taking a calculated risk."
He added: "Most dot-com brands were not here two years ago, a year ago, the day before yesterday. We have a brand that's 231 years old, so we're not coming to the dot-com environment as a fly-by-night. The fact we're Britannica will make people ask 'What are they doing on the Internet?' "
Whither the clamor for Super Bowl commercial time if the dot-com boom goes bust? What primarily determines whether rates rise or fall is the health of the general economy. And for now at least, as Mr. Mandese noted, "there's still huge demand from existing advertisers" like "direct-to-consumer pharmaceuticals, telecommunications and financial companies."
CBS, which is to broadcast the Super Bowl in January 2001, has traded equity stakes in several dot-coms for commercial time. Some of those spots could certainly run during Super Bowl XXXV.
That inspired Mr. Mandese to predict "the first deal for an advertiser to trade equity to a network specifically for a Super Bowl spot."
And of course, Super Bowl mishaps are not confined to dot-coms. Take Just for Feet, a retail chain that was a first-time Super Bowl advertiser last January. Its commercial was roundly criticized as offensive. Then problems like an ill-timed expansion and changes in footwear fashion led the company to file for Federal bankruptcy protection.
The result: the first Super Bowl spot from Just for Feet may very well have been its last.
"You don't have to be a dot-com to be stupid," said Mr. DeWitt of DeWitt Media.

In Prosperity, Nagging Pangs Of Uneasiness

BYLINE: By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
Consider this a letter to a friend.
It's not, of course. Who writes letters in this era of e-mail and cell phones? So, O.K., this is not really a letter to a friend, but letters to (and from) friends are great journalistic devices to create an instant sense of perspective.
Hence, a letter to this friend, a former New Yorker. Now living in L.A. 
 November 1999
 
DEAR, uh, Friend,
I haven't written in nearly three years -- a virtual generation in the life of a city, certainly in this ever-evolving place that you once called home.
I thought you'd like to know how it's doing.
It has changed -- moving in the direction it was going when you left, and in most ways that direction was up.
The city still feels safer, Midtown streets are thronged and Times Square is a fantasyland, more and more so. Dazzling lights, disappeared sleaze, stores filled with Disney and Disney-like tchotchkes, TV studios, lights, camera, action.
Tourists are all over the place, which helps the tone of the city, helps businesses, even helps the street people -- from the panhandlers to the portrait artists, mostly immigrants who turn block after block into minicarnivals.
Parts of the city are so fat that even the wealthy gasp at the price of apartments. And gentrification is out of control -- great for those with money, awful for those without, many of them illegal immigrants already living in closets.
Traffic is terrible, but other cities have it worse. And our water is still good (though environmentalists are getting queasy; but that's for another letter).
I guess what this all boils down to is: If you are wealthy, or at least comfortable, New York City is a great place to live now, and affluence, while it eludes many, trickles down to others.
And yet, and yet. Having lived through more cycles in this city than I care to remember, I have this disquieting feeling about where we are going.
I worry about what we are not doing with our affluence, how we are ignoring problems or sweeping them out of sight, how the politicians often need a crisis or tragedy to act, even when they know the solution, how the mayor always turns to the police, and keeps assaulting the First Amendment.
I worry that it takes a woman's death at the hands of a disturbed man to shake up Albany. Not until that tragedy did the governor and Legislature focus on the problem of mentally ill people on our streets. And still, the city isn't getting anywhere near as much money as it needs for an approach that even skeptics agree works -- housing these mentally troubled people in buildings with counselors on the premises.
At least tragedy got Albany to do the right thing, however modestly. In the city, a tragedy provoked nothing but a headline-grabbing quick fix.
After another woman was badly injured by a man believed to be homeless, the mayor directed the police to arrest vagrants who refuse shelter. We know from experience and exhaustive studies that most homeless vagrants are drug addicts, alcoholics or mentally ill and need real help to make the rest of us safer, not a few nights in jail.
I worry even more about our children. The schools remain a mess. Some are still burning coal, roofs leak, windows don't open or close, classrooms are overcrowded. There have been improvements, given where we were. But with all our wealth, why don't we fix up all the schools immediately? Why doesn't Donald Trump take on that mission instead of pursuing this nonsense about the White House?
I know. Simplistic. Especially in a city where the rich have no investment in the public schools because their children are not in them.
The frustrating thing is, we know what to do about the schools. We know we need longer days and year-round schooling, better pay for teachers, smaller classes. So what do we debate? Vouchers, test scores and charter schools.
New Yorkers are like everyone else. We like to have a good time and enjoy our affluence and babble about Regis and his trivial pursuit of televised millionaires. We like lights and fun and safer streets. I'm for all of that. I just think we have to get serious about things that aren't so great, more so in the good times.
Maybe with the first lady and the mayor running for the Senate (we think), New York will get down to basics.
Then again, maybe not.
More later, and sorry to have been out of touch. I promise to write regularly from now on. . . .

HEADLINE: Big Plans for New Jersey's Schools, but Where's the Money?

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER 

DATELINE: TRENTON, Nov. 26

 BODY:
As the legislative session draws to a close here, lawmakers are hammering out plans for one of America's most ambitious statewide school construction and renovation efforts, a something-for-everyone financing program that could wind up costing as much as $11 billion -- nearly what Congress was considering spending to rebuild schools across the country.
The debate until now has largely been about details, like whether ninth graders in the next generation of New Jersey high schools will have enough room to lean back in their chairs and stare at the ceiling. 
 But while legislators have gone so far as to calculate that 151 square feet per pupil of classroom, cafeteria and corridor space is enough, and any more is a luxury the state cannot afford, they have neglected one not so minor point: where they will find the billions they are promising to spend.
The silence on that question has left lobbyists for New Jersey's public schools all but holding their breath, unsure whether decades of state neglect is about to end or whether this latest and greatest commitment of resources from Trenton will fail sooner or later.
As early as last spring, when Gov. Christine Todd Whitman spelled out her own plan for $6 billion in school construction, she identified $112 million in annual revenue that could be used to make the yearly payments on bonds issued for the project: $62 million from the new Big Game multistate lottery and $50 million from cigarette taxes.
The list of earmarked revenues has not grown by a nickel since, though the $7 billion in revenue that New Jersey is expected to receive over the next 25 years from the nationwide settlement of tobacco litigation -- money that has its own long list of hopeful recipients in the health care field -- remains a tempting pot.
The annual payments needed to support billions in school construction could run to $600 million or more after a few years, according to current estimates.
Yet leaders in both houses of the Legislature say plainly that they will not dedicate an additional $500 million in existing revenues before they enact a school construction plan.
The State Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, suggested this week that some construction money could come from the annual growth in state revenues, which has averaged more than half a billion dollars since 1994. He said that an economic downturn, which could erode such growth, seemed unlikely for the foreseeable future, and that regardless, lawmakers in future years would simply have to find a way to pay the bills.
"This is going to be an item built in to the budget every year, like school aid," Mr. DiFrancesco said.
To educators, however, even the comparison to school aid is discomfiting. The state has routinely fallen short of its commitments of money for classroom instruction and for school building projects. A year ago, the state appropriated only 85 percent of what it had promised local school boards paying off their debts. Only this year did the level of aid reach 100 percent of the state's commitment.
With that in mind, Barbara J. Bohi, assistant director of the New Jersey School Boards Association, voiced what is likely to be a common criticism at Monday's hearing of the Senate Education Committee: "If the Legislature doesn't intend to have the revenue to fund this, then don't put this beautiful program in writing," she said. "Don't sell us on this wonderful construction program and have no intention of following through. You can't pull hundreds of millions of dollars out of thin air every year."
But to lawmakers, Ms. Bohi's and other advocates' calls for a stable, dedicated revenue stream of hundreds of millions of dollars a year to pay for the school construction effort sound much like a push for a tax increase -- two words rarely uttered in Trenton these days.
"The political climate's not anywhere near where anyone wants to discuss that," said John S. Wisniewski, a Democrat from Sayreville who is on the Assembly's Education Committee. "I'm certainly not an advocate for it, but part of the debate is stifled, and it makes legislating a little more difficult."
Even if they stall on how to pay for it, lawmakers have little choice but to enact some form of school construction program soon. Under a 1998 court order, the state must pay for at least $2.8 billion in work on school buildings in the state's 28 poorest communities, beginning in the spring.
But as a political matter, Republican lawmakers who mainly represent suburban and rural communities say that, court order or not, they would be hard pressed to defend so much aid to the mostly urban school districts involved in the litigation unless there was plenty of money for their own school districts as well.
The current bill, for example, offers subsidies or low-interest loans to every one of the state's 618 school districts.
Generally speaking, the state would pay for and manage the rebuilding of schools in the 30 poorest districts -- the 28 involved in the litigation, plus two more considered equally needy, Neptune and Plainfield.
On a sliding scale based on a district's wealth, the state would provide up-front money for other districts to rebuild their schools, although districts receiving subsidies of more than 50 percent would also be required to use a state building authority as their construction manager. For wealthier districts, a $1 billion revolving-loan fund would be able to make $200 million in construction loans each year at below market rates.
All those details, of course, would hinge on future Legislatures continuing the commitment made by this one -- a plan that is one of the most ambitious in any state.
Illinois and Virginia, by comparison, are each spending around $1 billion for school buildings, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In California, voters approved a $9.2 billion bond issue, but that program will rebuild not only public schools but also community colleges.
Terry Whitney, an educational finance analyst at the conference, suggested that New Jersey school officials who faulted the Legislature for failing to set aside money to pay for the construction effort were being a bit too demanding.
"Are they in any worse position than they were to begin with?" he said. "Right now, they may not be getting anything at all. The best thing that could come out of this is some state assistance of some sort. The only answer is, they've got to wait."

HEADLINE: A Carnival of Derision to Greet the Princes of Global Trade

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 28

 BODY:
There will be hundreds of protesters in sea-turtle costumes and stilt walkers dressed as monarch butterflies. Thousands of people will tie up the downtown area during a giant demonstration, and protesters will chain themselves to buildings or scale walls to unfurl banners denouncing the target of their ire: the World Trade Organization.
In what is shaping up as one of the biggest protest efforts in years, people from more than 500 organizations have poured into Seattle. They are here to accuse the W.T.O., the 135-nation Geneva-based trade group that is holding its ministerial meeting here this week, of favoring free trade at the expense of the environment, consumer safety and workers' rights. 
 The protest groups range from the well-known, like Friends of the Earth and the Humane Society, to the obscure, like the Ruckus Society and Raging Grannies.
Several, including the Sierra Club and the United Steelworkers of America, are planning a Seattle Tea Party on Monday with the slogan, "No Globalization Without Representation." Imitating their Boston forebears, the protesters plan to throw steel imported from China into the sea, along with some shrimp, hormone-treated beef and other goods they view as tainted by the trade group's decisions.
"The W.T.O. responds to the needs and interests of the very rich and corporations, but it doesn't respond to the needs of the environment, labor, the poor, women or indigenous people," said Alli Starr, a dancer in the radical group Art and Revolution, who flew in from San Francisco to protest and do street theater.
Borrowing a page from Vietnam War protests, the trade organization's critics have scheduled a weeklong cavalcade of activities, including teach-ins, concerts, mock trials of corporations and appearances by sympathetic members of Congress. Like the 1968 Democratic Party convention in Chicago, the trade meeting has become a magnet for all manner of protest.
On Monday night, hundreds of protesters plan to form a human chain around Seattle's exhibition center to demand that wealthy nations cancel the debt owed by the world's poor nations. The biggest event will be a protest march on Tuesday sponsored by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., which wants the trade group to allow trade sanctions against countries that violate core labor standards, like prohibitions against child labor.
Some of the groups hope to persuade the trade body to change its ways, while others want to disrupt it, with the ultimate goal of destroying it. In 1919, Seattle endured one of the nation's first general strikes, but it has never experienced protests with people from so many different groups -- labor unions, farm groups, environmental groups -- and so many countries, including Canada, France, Panama and India.
Ten years ago, trade ministers' meetings attracted only a handful of protesters who were largely seen as cranks, but the protests have mushroomed and include many mainstream groups. The protests have been fueled by the Internet, anxiety about globalization and anger with World Trade Organization rulings.
In the most-criticized ruling, the United States was found to have acted illegally in barring imported shrimp caught by fishing fleets whose nets do not contain devices allowing sea turtles to escape. The protesters also attack a ruling that an American requirement for a smog-fighting gasoline additive was an unfair trade barrier and another that concluded that Europe had no scientific basis for barring hormone-treated beef from the United States and Canada.
"So many people are upset with the W.T.O. because of the expansiveness of its limits on government health and safety actions," said Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch, a Ralph Nader group that has been the main coordinator of the protests. "The W.T.O. has managed to gore everyone's ox. Its track record has been that every single environmental or health policy it has reviewed has been found to be an illegal trade barrier."
The ministers gathered here plan intense, closed-door talks to decide what specific areas of trade should be included in a multiyear round of negotiations aimed at reducing trade barriers. In contrast, many protesters hope to make their protests as visible as possible.
In many ways, the meeting has become ground zero for anyone with a complaint about the world economy. There are protesters against the growing gap between rich and poor, against genetically engineered products, against despoiling rain forests and against America's economic and political dominance.
"We will be using a carnival festival model to oppose the W.T.O.," said Brooke Lehman, a New York-based protester active in a group called No to W.T.O.
Sixty groups in a coalition called the Turning Point Project are spending more than $100,000 on full-page advertisements attacking the trade group, saying that expanded agricultural trade is hurting small farmers in dozens of countries and causing more pollution and energy use.
The Geneva-based trade group's defenders say globalization and expanded trade are vital for helping the economies of poor countries, and some proponents suggest that many protesters want to stop economic progress altogether.
With so many protesters crowding into Seattle, police officials here say they fear some violence. Three protesters were arrested on Saturday. Two had suspended a protest banner from a highway retaining wall. But many protest leaders say they fear that violence would detract from their message.
"I'm scared that if one anarchist throws a brick through a store window downtown, that will become the big story, and our whole critique of the W.T.O. is going to get lost," said Michael Dolan, Public Citizen's main coordinator of the protests.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Gay Republican Cleaves to the Party Despite a Bush Snub

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
AS an outspokenly gay Republican, Richard Tafel is accustomed to critiques from the left and the right. He recently wrote a book, "Party Crasher: A Gay Republican Challenges Politics as Usual," that essentially tries to defend his place on the political map -- or, as he puts it somewhat more grandly, to answer the question: "How did a nice guy like me find myself in the crossfire of American politics?"
Mr. Tafel, who is executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay political group, writes that he was once compared to an abused wife who goes back to her husband, again and again. But Mr. Tafel sees his steadfast Republicanism as a matter of stubborn principle, not pathology. He grew up as one of six children in Bucks County, Pa., with a set of Republican beliefs. "It didn't make sense that I should jettison everything that I was -- my family, my faith, my political principles -- because I was gay," he says. 
Still, it was one of those weeks for Mr. Tafel. A week ago, the Republican front-runner in the presidential race, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, appeared on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" and was asked, in a wide-ranging interview, whether he would meet with the Log Cabin Republicans. Mr. Bush answered, "Oh, probably not," explaining "it creates a huge political scene." Mr. Tafel was on his way to church when his cell phone started ringing with reports of what Mr. Bush had said.
A few days later, in his office near Dupont Circle, Mr. Tafel still seemed slightly surprised by the whole affair, which struck him as strangely "passe."
"I just thought, what a dumb mistake," he said. "Ten years ago his father met with gays in the White House. Pat Buchanan announced he's welcoming gays to support his campaign in the Reform Party. Jerry Falwell met with gays down in Lynchburg, Va. It's just not a big deal."
"We are way beyond meetings," Mr. Tafel insisted.
It is, however, the kind of episode that makes Democrats ask: Why do gay Republicans stay? "Gay Republicans are in the Republican Party primarily because they agree with most of the Republican agenda -- less government, free markets, a strong defense, a tradition of individual rights that has been in debate this whole decade," Mr. Tafel said. "I think the gay Republican says, I would rather change the Republican Party to make it more inclusive, which will benefit every gay person in the long run, than flee to the Democratic Party, get placed under the umbrella of identity politics and then be put in a position, strategically as a community, where we get written off by the Republicans and taken for granted by the Democrats."
In other words, Mr. Tafel, 37, takes the long view. Already, he says, Republicans are competing for gay voters in many states. Moreover, he argues, "It's not like we're asking them to do something courageous that's going to lose for them." Republicans do better in elections when they are perceived to be tolerant, he said.
And what do gay Republicans want from their party? "Our goal is for this to be a neutralized issue," he said. Yes, he added, his members are concerned about issues like adoption and gay marriage, but "the short-term goal is to neutralize the rhetoric and the fear. And when George W. Bush says he can't meet, you know, there's only one group in the Republican Party that he can't meet with, we have a long way to go."
How did Mr. Tafel end up here, living on his party's uneasy fault line between economic and social conservatism? He intended to become a minister; he was raised in the American Baptist Church, and his grandfather and a great-uncle were ministers in the Swedenborgian church, a small Protestant denomination whose theology reflects the work of the 18th-century philosopher and scientist Emmanuel Swedenborg.
Mr. Tafel majored in philosophy at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania, then went to Harvard Divinity School. He came out after he moved to Cambridge; "the word wasn't even mentioned where I grew up," he said. He received his Master of Divinity degree and became an ordained minister, but was pulled ever deeper into politics, eventually working in the administration of Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts, the moderate Republican.
The 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, and in particular Patrick J. Buchanan's declaration that a "cultural war" was breaking out in America, made Mr. Tafel determined to stay and fight in the Republican Party. For the last six years he has been executive director of the Log Cabin Republicans, which has its roots in California and is named for Abraham Lincoln.
IN the short term, Mr. Tafel said, the Bush flap will build support among gay Republicans for Senator John McCain of Arizona, Mr. Bush's rival, who has met with the group. "Our people are much more excited about raising money for McCain," Mr. Tafel said, adding that his goal is to raise $50,000 for him by the end of the year. A Log Cabin strategy meeting is planned for this week, and in the meantime, Mr. Tafel was making the round of the talk shows, arguing that Mr. Bush's move was not only wrong, but bad politics.
In the end, Mr. Tafel said last week, "Our battle in the Republican Party is to make it what it should be -- a party of Lincoln, a party of inclusion." He acknowledged that it was not a job for the thin-skinned, but, as he put it in his book, "I didn't get involved in politics to be liked."

Better Ways to Measure Poverty

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN 

 BODY:
Poverty remains, at 13 percent of the population, more prevalent today than it was during the 1970's despite substantial economic growth and antipoverty spending over the past 30 years. In New York City, poverty remains stuck at nearly twice the national average and only barely below levels that prevailed during the recession of the early 1990's.
Persistent poverty reflects the fact that economic gains have largely passed those at the bottom and that an influx of poor immigrants has hit some large cities. But the figures also reflect the quirky way the government measures poverty. The Times reported last month that the government is considering revising its definition of poverty in ways that could add millions to the rolls. The new definition, if adopted by government agencies, could change which people, and how many, qualify for welfare. 
 Administration officials have not yet decided to change the standard so that more people are deemed poverty stricken. But they are reviewing recommendations made in 1995 by a National Academy of Sciences advisory panel. The panel reached widespread agreement on how a family's income should be measured, but it could not agree on how much income people need to rise above poverty.
The current poverty threshold, adopted in the 1960's, was set at three times the cost of a minimally nutritious diet. The threshold has since been increased by the overall rate of inflation, rising to about $17,000 for a family of four in 1998.
Economists have noted serious shortcomings in this measure. It underestimates poverty in high-cost regions like New York because it takes no account of huge outlays families must make for housing. Nor does the standard take account of payroll taxes, out-of-pocket medical costs or day care and other costs of working. On the other hand, the standard exaggerates the amount of poverty by ignoring non-cash benefits provided by the government, like tax credits to low-wage workers, housing assistance, Medicaid benefits and food stamps.
By this misleading standard, Congress could provide poor people in New York City vouchers that would, without charge, allow them to live in Trump Towers and eat daily at the Four Seasons, yet the official poverty rolls would not decline one digit. The panel recommended a more realistic measure of family income that starts with cash income, subtracts taxes and out-of-pocket medical, child-care and some other costs and adds in the value of food stamps, housing assistance and tax credits.
On the issue of where the poverty threshold should be set, the panel recommended a method but not a precise answer. It proposed an elastic threshold that would keep pace with the rising living standards of low-income families rather than, as under the current measure, remaining fixed by the food-buying habits of the 1960's. The proposed threshold would equal the amount that a representative group of low-income families actually spends on food, clothing and housing plus 15 percent or so more to cover other expenditures.
Exactly where the proposed threshold would lie would depend, then, on which low-income families the government chose to base consumption spending for the poor. If, for example, it chose families whose incomes fall below all but the poorest 30 percent of American families, the poverty threshold would rise above the existing standard, adding millions more people to the poverty rolls. But the government could cut the poverty count by setting the threshold in terms of the buying habits of less well-off families, say those whose incomes fall below all but 20 percent of families.
Some panel members, like Prof. Sheldon Danziger of the University of Michigan, and outside experts, like Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution, propose setting the new threshold at an income level that keeps measured poverty the same under the new and old standards in the year the new standard is adopted. That way, the government can adopt relatively uncontroversial improvements in the standard without getting buried in the controversy of deciding how many people to label poverty stricken.
The important point is that the new standard would yield a smarter way to track changes in poverty over time. Accurately accounting for changes over time soon becomes more important than the number chosen for the amount of poverty in the year the new standard is adopted.
Indeed, tracking changes is all that a poverty standard really does. The number 11 in the statement "poverty hit 11 percent in the early 1970's" is arbitrary. But the fact that poverty rose by about two percentage points over the next 25 years is meaningful -- something bad happened.
Said another way, Congress needs a standard that would indicate, were it to double tax credits, housing vouchers and health benefits for the poor, that it did something good.

Bullying the Homeless

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT 

 BODY:
Away from the parade, hunched in doorways or curled up in boxes soggy from the steady rain, the street people passed the Thanksgiving holiday.
Some were lucky enough to catch a meal at a soup kitchen. Some reaped a small bonanza in donations from passers-by in a holiday mood. But others, less fortunate, were rousted and handcuffed and taken away to jail. 
 New York's current mayor, as cold a politician as you'll ever see, has chosen this moment in the city's history, this moment of great prosperity and good cheer, to sic the police on the homeless. So on the day after Thanksgiving, you had the following headline in Newsday: "Arrests Feed Anger of Homeless." And in The Daily News: "The mayor targets us like prey, say needy."
And even in The Post, as good a friend as the mayor is likely to find, you had a homeless man named Harry Reynolds quoted as saying: "It's a shame! I'm not on crack. I'm not mentally ill. I just could not afford to pay rent."
Rudolph Giuliani's latest approach to the devastating problem of homelessness is not just cruel, it's incoherent. A month ago he was threatening to throw people out of the homeless shelters and onto the streets if they refused to work. Now he's got the police arresting people who are on the streets for refusing to go to a shelter.
This is not policy-making. This is not a reasoned attempt to deal with a complex problem. It's a mayor with a whip lashing out blindly at some of the weakest, most troubled people in New York.
Most of those arrested are back on the streets a day later, back to the cardboard box or the dark alley or the tiny corner of a park that they've turned into a wretched approximation of home. I doubt that a night in jail has made them any wiser, or the city any safer. What it does, according to homeless advocates, is make the street people a lot more frightened. Perhaps the mayor, who has bullied people throughout his public career, thinks that's just what they deserve.
This official assault on the homeless is the mayor's response to the attack on Nicole Barrett, who was almost killed by a man who smashed her skull with a paving stone at a midtown intersection on Nov. 16. Witnesses said the man might have been homeless, and it is generally assumed he was mentally ill. New Yorkers were both chilled and saddened by the apparently random attack, and many were angered. But there is no sense that the public supports an arbitrary crackdown on the homeless.
A poll by New York 1 News last week found that 77 percent of respondents opposed the arrest of homeless people who refuse shelter. And several members of the clergy have let it be known that they do not want the police to disturb homeless people who seek refuge outside their churches.
The Church of the Holy Apostles on Ninth Avenue in Chelsea, which runs the city's largest soup kitchen, was especially vehement in its response to the mayor's actions. It issued a public statement that assailed the mayor's "mean-spiritedness" and asserted: "The policy of attacking the most vulnerable of our city in the midst of an economic boom for the majority is unworthy of the values we celebrate this holiday. This is another instance of 'criminalizing' the homeless, not for what they have actually done, but for simply who they are."
Homeless advocates have reacted bitterly to the mayor's crackdown. "There is no logic here," said Mary Brosnahan of the Coalition for the Homeless. "It runs counter to everything we've learned over the past 20 years about how to help the homeless. The solution is to have legitimate outreach, not outreach with a sidearm."
Mayor Giuliani himself has long said he agreed with advocates that the way to help the homeless who are mentally ill is to get them into community-based mental health facilities -- residences in which troubled individuals can receive the services and medication they need.
That kind of difficult but worthy effort is the opposite of throwing the homeless in jail.
With his police force at the ready, the mayor now says, "We're going to spend a lot of time removing homeless people from the streets." And he speaks contemptuously of those who truly want to help the homeless.
The problem may be complex, but the current policy of the current mayor is a cold and simple one: Cuff 'em, and lock 'em up.

HEADLINE: SOVEREIGN ISLANDS -- A Question of Regulation;
Alaskans Choose Sides in Battle Over Cruise Ships

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 

DATELINE: JUNEAU, Alaska

 BODY:
The cruise ship industry, once embraced as a savior for Alaska's lagging economy, has worn out its welcome in some quarters.
Fed up with giant ships that discharge waste into their waterways and with tourists who flood their downtown, residents of Juneau, the state capital, in early October approved a $5 tax on every passenger. A bit farther north, the small town of Haines voted to limit the number of cruise ships allowed at its dock. And some Juneau residents have called for one cruise line to be barred from the state's waters. 
 But the Alaskans who are fighting to restrict the booming $12 billion cruise ship industry have a powerful opponent they may not have expected: their own representatives in the United States Congress.
At every juncture, efforts to slow the industry's expansion in Alaska have been blocked by members of the state's Congressional delegation, all three of whom are Republicans and chairmen of committees with wide influence over both the state and the industry.
In the last three years, the Alaska delegation has, among other actions, opened the way to allowing more ships into the environmentally delicate waters of Glacier Bay National Park, stymied federal efforts to consider stricter antipollution standards for ships and overridden a state law prohibiting shipboard gambling in Alaska waters.
Some of the actions were legislative sleights of hand, adding amendments to bills after public discussion had ended. In some cases, people here do not even know what their representatives have done for the industry. Other actions were exercises in political muscle by an influential Alaska tag team, Senator Frank H. Murkowski and Representative Don Young, the chairmen, respectively, of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the House Resources Committee.
Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Young and their spokesmen contend that they are not protecting the cruise industry but promoting tourism in Alaska, where the economy has suffered from declines in the timber industry and a slackening of oil revenue. And many businesspeople throughout the region have applauded their delegation's efforts as loudly as environmentalists have condemned them, noting that the cruise industry has been crucial to the state's economy.
Cruise ship passengers spend more than $160 million a year in southeast Alaska, according to a 1997 study financed by the industry and the cities in the region. In Juneau, the influx of passengers has spawned dozens of businesses, from upscale art galleries to T-shirt shops, and helped rejuvenate the downtown area.
"There's been a very positive impact from the cruise ships," said Jack Cadigan, whose family owns three shops that cater to tourists.
Mayor Dennis Egan of Juneau agreed that the industry's growth had helped the economy, and he gave part of the credit to the state's Congressional delegation.
"They are friends of the industry, no question about that," said Mr. Egan, a Democrat. "And they have Alaskan issues at heart, too."
But the tensions have grown as the foreign-registered cruise companies have become a major leisure industry, with legislative protections that are the envy of American business, and as the Alaska delegation has played an important and little-understood role in helping to expand the number of ships and passengers visiting the state.
 
An Age-Old Feud
A look at the fight that has broken out here provides insight into that role, as well as into how the industry's ever-larger ships, some of them longer than three football fields, are beginning to stir a backlash in some communities. The struggle also reflects an age-old feud over Alaska's unrivaled natural resources. It echoes earlier battles between the timber and oil interests, who have often bristled at too much Washington meddling, and the environmentalists, whom some critics portray as uncompromising in the face of a struggling local economy.
Kimberly Metcalfe-Helmar, a second-generation Juneau resident and president of a downtown neighborhood group, was surprised and pleased by the vote to tax cruise passengers. Just three years ago, she had led an unsuccessful effort to pass an identical tax.
"I've been fighting this since the mid-80's, but it's only recently that the noise, pollution and dumping have galvanized the town," Ms. Metcalfe-Helmar said.
The tax was approved by nearly 70 percent of the voters. The margin of victory demonstrated how frustrated many of the people in this town of 30,000 have become with the 600,000 passengers who clog their streets each summer, and with the ships whose smokestacks send a hazy pollution snaking around the mountains that cradle the town.
But the backlash also reflected deep indignation over the admission by one company, Royal Caribbean International, that its ships had dumped hazardous waste within the Inside Passage, whose clear glacial waters wind gently through southeast Alaska and teem with salmon, halibut, king crab and whales.
The industry's reaction to the vote was swift. Princess Cruises, which brought about 180,000 passengers to Juneau this past summer, said its ships would shorten their stays next season, a decision that created anxiety among local businesses about lost revenue and led them to form a pro-tourism organization. The company also said it was canceling the one stop it had planned for next summer in Haines. Princess's representative here said the moves were intended to lessen the cruises' impact on the two towns.
Another cruise line took action that some people saw as clearly punitive. Holland America Line cut off donations to some charitable and civic organizations in Juneau, including the arts council and the Civil Air Patrol, and explained that the tax vote had prompted a "reassessment" of its relationship with the city. The local newspaper, The Juneau Empire, condemned the company for taking revenge on nonprofit groups.
Tensions may flare again when state regulators hold a public meeting here, scheduled for this Friday, to consider whether new restrictions are needed to curtail the activities of cruise ships. Such restrictions would again put backers at odds with industry stalwarts in Congress.
The cruise industry maintains a low profile in Washington, and its contributions to candidates for federal office from January 1993 through the end of October 1999 totaled $1.2 million, far less than those of many other interest groups. But an analysis of contributions by individuals and political action committees associated with the industry found that they have been most generous with the Alaska and Florida delegations, which makes sense given that the companies have their most important operations in those states.
The Alaska delegation, whose third member is Senator Ted Stevens, chairman of the Appropriations Committee, was the second-largest recipient of campaign contributions, with $117,950. Only Florida, which has 25 members in Congress and is also home to most of the cruise companies, got more: $230,701.
Mr. Young was the largest House recipient, with $69,500. Three years ago he played a pivotal role when a lucrative part of the industry's business was threatened.
 
The Battle Over Gambling
Alaska law limits gambling to charities, which operate small-scale bingo games and raffles to raise money. In 1993 the state attorney general determined that the law extended into the waters the state controlled within three miles of shore and ordered cruise ships to shut down their casinos.
In most places, the order would not have had much impact, because cruises quickly escape the three-mile jurisdiction of American states and operate in international waters, where they are free of regulation.
But in Alaska the itinerary follows the Inside Passage along the rugged coast, and only several sections along the route, known as doughnut holes, are more than three miles from either shore. That made it illegal for the ships to operate highly lucrative casinos for virtually the entire time they were in Alaska.
Cruise industry lobbyists persuaded the legislature to change the law in 1994, but the governor at the time, Walter Hickel, vetoed the bill. The next year, the industry won a temporary exemption for a single season.
Frustrated in Juneau, the industry turned to Mr. Young, a former Yukon tugboat captain, asking him to assert federal authority over gambling within Alaska's waters.
He responded in the fall of 1996 by inserting an amendment into the Coast Guard authorization bill after public hearings had ended. The amendment, which applied solely to Alaska, prevented the state from banning gambling except when ships were docked or within three miles of a port of call. Mr. Young's staff acknowledged that the amendment had been sought by the industry and applied just to the big ships in southeast Alaska.
The change caught state officials by surprise. "All of a sudden came this federal law saying they could gamble," said Deborah Vogt, who at the time was the deputy commissioner of the state revenue department.
Meanwhile, Senator Murkowski was undoing plans to allow the National Park Service to weigh new antipollution standards for cruise ships in exchange for permitting more vessels to enter Glacier Bay, the national park and preserve 65 miles northwest of Juneau.
Glacier Bay is a 3.2 million-acre expanse of towering mountains, deep fjords and forests. It is home to abundant wildlife, including several species of whales, seals and otters, and its unspoiled beauty makes it the destination of choice for cruise ships.
For years, Mr. Murkowski had pushed to allow more ships into the bay, arguing that it was the most environmentally sound way for people to see the park. Park service officials resisted, fearing that the noise and air pollution would be harmful, especially to the endangered humpback whales.
After the Republican Party took control of Congress in 1994, Mr. Murkowski became chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which oversees the budget of the Interior Department and the park service.
At Mr. Murkowski's urging, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt directed the park service to expand cruise ship permits to 184, or two ships a day, from about 100, during the three-month summer cruise season.
After environmental groups threatened to sue, a compromise was reached. A slightly slower expansion was approved on the condition that the park service receive authority to impose higher antipollution standards if they were found to be warranted by later studies.
"The amazing thing was that we managed to put together a plan that satisfied just about everybody," said Chip Dennerlein, the Alaska regional director for the National Parks and Conservation Association.
After the compromise was published in The Federal Register, however, Mr. Murkowski added a last-minute amendment to the 1996 parks bill that took away the park service's authority to increase pollution controls.
The change came at the urging of the cruise industry, whose lobbyists had argued that it was unfair to hold their ships to a higher standard than other vessels, according to Mr. Murkowski's staff and a former industry lobbyist.
"It was like the rug was pulled out from under us," Mr. Dennerlein said.
The park service was surprised, too. Robert D. Barbee, the regional director for Alaska, wrote to the cruise lines in March 1997 that the change "effectively negates a key mitigation measure" and that it prevented the park service from adopting "higher planning and operating standards."
Mr. Murkowski's chief of staff, David Garman, defended the senator's action, arguing that Glacier Bay could handle two ships a day without damaging the environment and that the park service should not establish antipollution standards. Mr. Garman also said the senator would consider tightening laws and regulations if it became clear that ships were polluting Alaska's waters.
The prospect of tightening regulations will be the subject of the coming public meeting in Juneau. The Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation scheduled the session after concerns were raised that current laws were no longer sufficient in this age of megaships.
"These ships are floating cities, really larger than most cities in Alaska," said Michele Brown, commissioner of the department. "But unlike cities, they don't need a permit to pump their waste into the Inside Passage."
With 3,000 or more passengers and crew members, a big cruise ship generates an average of 170,000 gallons a day of gray water from showers, sinks and dishwashers, and 17,000 gallons of black water, or human waste, according to industry officials.
Under current federal and international laws, ships can discharge gray water anywhere. Human waste and ground food waste can be discharged legally anywhere beyond three miles from shore.
The three-mile-limit standard has caused concerns in southeast Alaska because of the doughnut holes within the Inside Passage. Though technically international waters, the holes lie within the passage and adjacent to fertile fishing grounds and feeding areas for humpback whales. In October, The Anchorage Daily News reported that some ships had discharged waste in the holes.
Pointing to the holes on a nautical chart in his Juneau office earlier this month, Steven A. Torok, the senior Environmental Protection Agency official in Alaska, said the law did not take them into account. "Three miles offshore was intended to be three miles offshore, not within the Inside Passage," he said.
 
'They Say It's Legal'
Two independent pilots who help ship captains navigate the passage said in interviews that they were often asked to take ships to the areas to pump waste water overboard.
"They say it's legal, but nobody's monitoring what's in that water," said Capt. Robert W. Smith, who has spent 50 years in Alaska's waters and said he had often been directed to the doughnut holes. "We live here and we want to know what they're dumping."
Capt. Ted Kellogg said he sometimes encountered so many ships discharging in the holes along the eight miles of Chatham Strait that he was concerned about safety. "They want to get to the middle of the strait to dump, and you'll have vessels meeting on reciprocal courses," he said.
Captain Smith and Captain Kellogg said most lines, including Celebrity Cruises, Holland America Line and Princess Cruises, dumped waste into the holes.
Julie Benson, a spokeswoman for Princess Cruises, said the company was declining to answer questions because officials thought previous articles in The New York Times about the industry had been unfair.
Erik Elvejord, a spokesman for Holland America, said the company's ships did not discharge waste water into the doughnut holes and never discharged raw sewage. Instead, he said, the ships treat their sewage on board and discharge legally permissible gray water only while traveling between ports so the waste mixes with the largest amount of outside water possible.
Holland America sends the most ships into Glacier Bay, and Mr. Elvejord said company policy did not allow even gray water to be discharged within the bay.
Nancy J. Wheatley, senior vice president for safety and environment at Royal Caribbean, which is also the parent company of Celebrity Cruises, said Celebrity ships might have used the doughnut holes to discharge waste on occasion. But, she said, no ships from either line ever discharge raw sewage within the Inside Passage, and both lines try to discharge as little gray water as possible.
"Our company goal is to discharge to the greatest extent possible outside of 12 nautical miles," Ms. Wheatley said.
Since pleading guilty twice in the last 18 months to criminal charges involving a fleetwide conspiracy to discharge oily waste water and hazardous material, Royal Caribbean has adopted voluntary standards to operate above legal requirements for discharges. It has also begun experimenting with treating gray water before it is discharged. The company's president, Jack Williams, said at a town meeting in Juneau last August that he thought the laws governing discharges should be more stringent.
No ship can store all of its gray water during the average seven-day cruise through the Inside Passage. As a result, it must be discharged. Though the lines say their ships do not discharge gray water while sitting in port and never discharge raw sewage in the Inside Passage, some regulators are skeptical.
"The cruise lines say that they don't discharge raw sewage, but the issue is that the law allows them to do it and this is a very competitive industry," said Mr. Torok of the Environmental Protection Agency. "The laws and regulations are outdated."
Ms. Brown, the Alaska environment commissioner, said she would not hesitate to ask Congress for new laws restricting discharges if regulators determined that such legislation was necessary.
In the meantime, the state of Alaska took the unusual step Friday of filing a lawsuit in the United States Supreme Court claiming jurisdiction over the waters of southeast Alaska, including Glacier Bay. The suit argued that the federal Submerged Lands Act gives the state the right to regulate activities in the waters, including discharges by cruise ships.

Jeremiah Speaks

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE 

DATELINE: HARPERS FERRY, W. Va.

 BODY:
In changing around the clothes in my closet to get ready for winter, I made a dismaying discovery: I have 38 shirts.
What kind of person needs 38 shirts? I am not a clothes horse, much less a shirt freak. Even after subtracting the purple polyester corduroy given to me that I would not be caught dead in, that leaves more shirts than a man can wear in a month. 
 My first reaction is defensive. What's wrong with having a vast assortment of shirts? I make a good living; the good times are rolling. So what if there's no more room on my shelves? That means only that it's time to build more shelving.
What's more, my shirt acquisition program makes me an economy-driving consumer. This adds to the profits of Van Heusen or Brooks Brothers, thereby raising the stock value of America's pension funds and putting rice in the mouths of impoverished Malaysians who sew on the sleeves. Spending can thus be justified as a virtue, even when it buys the unneeded.
Muttering the millennial mantra, "spendthriftiness is next to godliness," I went to the factory-outlet mall in Hagerstown, Md. There, on Thanks-for-your-patronage Weekend, consumer consummation was rife. Hordes of buyers lined up to snatch items reduced from "list prices" that only fools in department stores pay.
Accompanied by my value-savvy family, I experienced the thrill of the bargain hunt. Nine West and Timberland shoes went for a pittance; Ralph Lauren suits from only last season were swept off a clearance rack; Donna Karan cashmere sweaters that hung down to the ankles were offered in all their dark-gray glory for a measly 99 bucks.
Every plastic-carded purchase seemed to be vengeance against the evil forces of "list." To get an early-bird reduction from the sale price -- with 50 percent off for the second pair of unneeded whatever -- was a buyer's bliss.
And yet, and yet. Standing here in the epicenter of pre-Christmasism, laden with shopping bags of merchandise that proved my worth both as a provider and conspicuous consumer, a nagging thought rooted in the dim past intrudes: is this the way I want to spend my leisure time? What kind of cheap triumph is a cheap sweater? Who needs all this stuff anyway?
Never say "piffle" to an epiphany. Today's rush to buy is not yesterday's addiction to acquisition. We have gone past that lust for possessions that motivated the hoarders of yesteryear. Greed is no longer the game; in our time, shopping has become the primary form of entertainment.
So here we are in the Age of Shoppertainment. What we buy and wear merges with what we see and hear; this great blob of self-absorption and inter-amusement takes up our time and occupies our minds. The moving finger writes the message on the T-shirt: To fill the shopping cart is to fulfill oneself.
The philosophy of the shoppertainers holds that the act of spending and not the object acquired is the source of fun. In the past, the poet worried that "getting and spending, we lay waste our powers," but as the getting gets easier, it's the spending that gives us the kick.
You can shop the world, but I want to get off. Mall mania may be the marketing majority's way of living, but it's no way of life. Doing the outlet center does not stimulate the mind or recreate the body or satisfy the soul.
The modern Jeremiah asks: as you snatch the merchandise off the shelf, are you learning something, or -- just as important -- are you teaching anything? The money you spend today you might re-make tomorrow, but the time you spend spending can never be bought back.
Worry not, the sensual sybarites of suburbia assure us, the malls and the factory-outlet centers are transitory. Coming generations will turn to the virtual virtues of Internet intellect, and knowledge and art will be the intercourse most desired.
But do you know what our offspring are already doing on that brave new medium? They say they are "engaged in e-commerce," but what they are doing is amusing themselves shopping.
This Jeremiah sees that future and it works all too well. Picked up a couple of nice shirts, though.

HEADLINE: More Traffic in the Double-Stroller Lane;
Twin Births Surge, and the Parents Face Special, and Costly, Challenges

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Jonathan Alexander was sitting comfortably in his stroller, ready to roll. His twin sister, Rachel, was screaming. She did not want to wear a jacket. She did not want to take a walk. She did not want to do much of anything, it seemed, but arch her back and wail in protest. Suddenly, as if in sympathy, Jonathan joined her.
Their mother, Robin Pollock, quickly attached Rachel to a baby carrier on her chest, while a baby sitter on standby stuck a pacifier in the little girl's mouth. One 13-month-old twin in the stroller, one attached to her mother's chest, out of their apartment and into the elevator they went. Making their way through the lobby was akin to a final maneuver in a playoff game: a quick move to the left, a fast pull to the right -- 22 minutes from the front door to the street. It was almost time for lunch. 
 In New York City on any day of the week, especially in Manhattan, one is bound to encounter a harried parent like Ms. Pollock, pushing a pair of matching little faces in their double-stroller, dodging indifferent shoppers and grinning onlookers. Since 1987, the number of twins has grown 20 percent in the city.
Evidence of the boom is everywhere. At an elementary school in Brooklyn, 26 sets of twins showed up this year. Lamaze coaches, who used to see one set of parents expecting twins a year, now report one a month.
It is much the same in the rest of the country, where a significant rise in the use of fertility treatments has largely contributed to a 55 percent overall jump in the births of twins since 1980, according to figures from the National Center for Health Statistics. And in many ways, the challenges of an instant family are indifferent to geography: the costs of extra diapers and the difficulty of breast-feeding two children at once are universal.
But a metropolis like New York -- where daily chores can tax the most mobile of residents -- presents its own host of quirks and difficulties for parents of twins. Problems of housing, schooling, medical care and especially simple logistics abound. (One mother wants to introduce legislation that would classify rearing twins as a disability, allowing for double-stroller access on city buses.)
Then there are New Yorkers themselves -- known more for excessiveness than restraint -- particularly those who have come to parenthood later in life, after a successful career and all its amenities and freedoms. That means an assistant, plenty of equipment and sometimes plenty of high drama.
"If you lived in Iowa, you wouldn't have a baby nurse for five months," said Jennifer Kumble, a mother of twin 3-year-olds. "But that is just one of the many strange New York phenomena." Parents of twins are increasingly "people who are fairly accomplished," she added. "I find myself telling people, 'You don't really need six strollers.' There are people who cannot go out the door without bringing help with them."
The explosion in twins is especially visible in New York because many families who a few years ago would have fled to the suburbs are now staying put, taking advantage of both a strong economy and their huge cohort. There were 3,954 twins born in New York City in 1998, 3.2 percent of all live births in the city.
In many ways, the city has obliged them. There are obstetricians and baby nurses who specialize in multiple births, shoe stores that offer discounts for twins, and subspecialists like Annie Rosenberg, who manages Albee Baby Carriage on the Upper West Side and advises parents on what to buy. (Hint: "Parents with twins like the ear thermometer," Ms. Rosenberg confided. "When you have twins, you do not have time to spend sticking thermometers in little tushes.") Pharmacies are happy to deliver triple packs of diapers.
But there are just as many obstacles, starting with pregnancy. Women who become pregnant with twins are automatically put into a high-risk classification by their doctors, and require more monitoring and more appointments and often have more emergencies.
"The reality is that twins tend to be more labor intensive in terms of their management," said Dr. Michael Strongin, an obstetrician at Lenox Hill Hospital on the Upper East Side. But because insurance companies do not consider the extra time and care these patients need when they set reimbursement rates, the cases tend to fall in the hands of a few doctors with a special interest in multiple births, he added.
It is not uncommon for women pregnant with twins to require bed rest or very curtailed activity, which comes as a big shock to someone who has spent the last decade of her life powering ahead in a busy career.
Elena Nachmanoff, a vice president of NBC News, who gave birth to twins three years ago, was told she needed to lie down on her left side several hours a day in the final stretch of her pregnancy. The news came just as she was hiring 250 people for a new division. So she interviewed them all while reclining on her office couch. "People went along with it," Ms. Nachmanoff said. "What could they do? I went into labor that way."
Pediatricians say that their roles, too, have altered as more twins have come into their practices. They have had to learn to comfort parents who have one child who is ready to go home but must leave one behind in the intensive care unit, a not uncommon situation, since multiple births often result in premature babies and complications.
They also say that pressing parents to treat each child as a complete individual -- not dressing them alike or assuming that they will develop on the same track -- often takes precedence over treating head colds.
"Now, I give two samples of Tylenol when one would do," said Dr. Laura Popper, a pediatrician on the Upper East Side, "because I really want us all to see that we have different people here."
Once children are old enough for school, parents of twins say, the stress automatically doubles as they race with "singletons" -- twin world argot for single children -- to get spots in private schools and the elite public school programs.
In interviews, a dozen parents all insisted that private schools were loath to give two coveted spots to one family with twin children because two families produced more fund-raising power. Private school admissions officers uniformly denied the accusation. But all agree that placing twins is difficult, and at places like the Garden House School of New York on the Upper East Side, the number of twins applying has doubled or tripled in the last few years. "When I would call each school," Ms. Nachmanoff said, "it was like I was cursed."
Susan Kasarsky spent $2,000 a year long before her children reached school age to participate in a parenting group at a temple with a preschool she liked. "I was told early on that my kids would get in if I did that, so I did and they did."
Having one twin get accepted into a school when another does not is one of the most painful, and logistically difficult, problems their parents often face.
Karl Berg prayed that his sons, Bryan and Gregory, would get into a public school kindergarten program for gifted children. But only one of the twins, who are now 7, got into the program, on the Upper West Side, so the two went to different schools their first year.
"One had Spanish class, the other didn't," Mr. Berg said. "One had augmented teaching, the other didn't. In one way it was good because it allowed them both to explore their own way. But then they had different friends and different play dates, and that was difficult, too."
Smadar Levy, who lives in Brooklyn with her twin fourth graders, said that going to a public school, P.S. 276 in Canarsie, that was chock full of twins was a boon for her children, Briana and Seth Zeltzer. "Teachers have become sensitive to it," Mrs. Levy said. "There are some stronger sibling rivalry issues with twins. They try to foster each special talent each child has, and know not to refer to them as 'the twins.' This is the real advantage to not being the only one on the block."
But debates over whether to put twins in the same class and how many strollers to buy are the furthest things from most parents' minds at the time of pregnancy, especially when they have gone through years of agonizing fertility treatments just to have the babies. In some other cases, it is women having children later in life, as there is a slightly higher incidence of twins among older mothers.
"The focus is so much on the pregnancy that the last thing you think about are what the problems might be," said Dr. Alan Kessler, who said that 25 percent of his practice at New York Presbyterian Hospital is now made up of multiple births, up from 5 percent 15 years ago.
"If the patients go through artificial technology," Dr. Kessler said, "they are very caught up in the goal of getting pregnant. The next goal is to have a successful pregnancy; very little goes into educating and discussing what life will be like after. That seems to be taken for granted. But that is beyond the purview of obstetrics."
Parents, usually mothers, tend to seek out parents of other twins for support, especially in the early months. The help can be enormous: equipment is traded, war stories shared. Everyone in the room has felt the painful pull of one child's cry while the other one is nursed, bathed or diapered.
Many parents of twins say they feel completely out of sync with parents who have single children, and the groups and classes that cater to them. Gymboree, a popular toddler activity class, is out; the company has a rule that each child must be paired with an adult. And who can swim at the Y.M.C.A. with two tiny tadpoles?
Yet to have a constant baby sitter in tow creates its own loneliness. "You always need help, and that is really a hard thing to live with," said Ms. Pollock, who lives on the Upper West Side and used to work as a lawyer. "You can't do it on your own, and no one ever gets a break."
Parents with singletons sometimes shudder at the thought of having twins over, each running in a different direction. Parents of twins "often feel unwelcome at play dates," said Kathy Junior, the co-director of Mothering Multiples, a support group. "They are bringing twins, which is too overwhelming to the other family. There are few places two kids can go with one parent and feel safe. We find that there is a lot of isolation."
There is also a subtle tension between many of the wealthier mothers -- who tend to be the ones who used fertility treatments -- and those who have less, which is played out in the support group meetings.
"It is financially stressful to have twins," said Kioka Jones, who lives in Harlem with her 15-month-old twins, Alassane, a boy, and Akemi, a girl, and their father, Alpha Balde. During one meeting of the Mothers of Twins Club, which meets monthly on the Upper East Side, she said, one mother complained about how hard it was when one of her children soiled an outfit, because she felt the need to change both twins so they matched.
"I can't imagine the type of lives these women lead," Ms. Jones said. "They can afford the fertility drugs, and so that means they can afford a lot of other things, and sometimes you want to say, 'Can we get back to the real issues here?' "
For all the tension, isolation and difficulties, parents of twins say there comes a moment when things do get better, especially when their children develop a symbiotic relationship.
"In the first year, many parents say if the house hadn't burned down it was a successful day," Dr. Junior said. "But then there is something so magical about watching these two beings share a budding relationship together. In the end, they have to say that it was a wonderful experience."

HEADLINE: Giuliani Is Consistent

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Bob Herbert's Nov. 29 column on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's misdirected handling of the homeless in New York City does not bode well for the rest of the state should Mr. Giuliani be elected to the Senate. 
 Mr. Guiliani's lack of sensitivity to those in dire straits is certainly "equal opportunity" in nature. He treats the mentally ill, the short-term unemployed, the single-parent family, the working poor and the chronic homeless with the same prescription: I don't care where you go, but you can't stay here!
Since the homeless populate every upstate city (and many rural areas as well), does Mr. Giuliani expect to continue this shortsighted approach on a statewide basis? Will he suggest that the homeless simply leave New York State?

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
George W.'s Answer

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS 

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
A small incident may give us crucial insight into the character of a presidential candidate. That happened last week when George W. Bush appeared on the NBC television program "Meet the Press."
Tim Russert asked Governor Bush whether he would meet with the Log Cabin Republicans, an organization of gay Republicans. "Oh, probably not," Mr. Bush replied. 
 Why not? "I don't believe in group thought," Governor Bush said, "pitting one group of people against another. . . . I mean, it's as if an individual doesn't count, but the group that the individual belongs to is more important."
So is Mr. Bush refusing to meet with other groups? Jewish Republicans, say, or the Christian Coalition, or Hispanic organizations? Of course not. No one can run for president, or governor, without meeting all kinds of groups -- ethnic, economic, religious, ideological.
The real reason for Mr. Bush's decision to shun the Log Cabin Republicans is plain. He does not want to offend the Christian right and other conservatives. It would have been easy for him to say, "I'll meet anybody." He didn't have the courage to say it.
The Rev. Jerry Falwell had a well-publicized meeting with gay leaders. Senator John McCain met the Log Cabin Republicans. But not George W. Bush.
His answer was especially disappointing because of his admirable record as governor on two sensitive issues: immigration and race. He steadfastly refused to follow the example of his fellow Republican governor Pete Wilson of California, who used them as wedge issues.
Governor Bush never appealed to xenophobic fears of Mexican immigrants, as Mr. Wilson did. Nor did he copy the Wilson attack on affirmative action. When the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reached out beyond the precedents to block state universities from considering the race of applicants, he supported a substitute plan to admit all Texas high school graduates in the top 10 percent of their class -- a plan that has had considerable success in maintaining student diversity.
Those positions took considerable courage: more, one would have thought, than a willingness to meet the Log Cabin Republicans. Could Mr. Bush's backbone be softening as he tries to please a national audience?
But in his record as governor there was one similarly troubling episode. Mr. Bush showed an insensitivity to the need for elementary fairness in the criminal justice system.
Texas executes more people than any other state: 195 since executions were resumed in this country in 1977, 31 so far this year. Most capital defendants are too poor to hire their own lawyers; under the Constitution the state must provide one. But some of the lawyers appointed to represent Texas defendants have done notoriously incompetent jobs. At least three slept while their clients were on trial for their lives. Others were drunk.
One reason for the failures of indigent defense in Texas appears to be a cozy relationship between certain judges and the lawyers they appoint as counsel. Judges have to run for re-election every four years. Their campaigns cost thousands, even millions of dollars, and much of the money is contributed by lawyers. Judges have appointed contributors as defense counsel.
This year the Texas Legislature passed -- unanimously in both houses -- a bill to reform the system for providing counsel to poor defendants. Because it has sometimes been weeks before an accused person even saw a lawyer, the bill also required that one be provided within 20 days. Most states put that limit at 72 hours.
The legislation brought an outcry from judges. Governor Bush vetoed it.
Those accused of crime have little public sympathy or political influence. For that very reason their fair treatment -- the treatment required by the Constitution -- is a telling test of political character.
Bill Clinton told us much about himself in 1992 when he flew home from the New Hampshire primary to see to the execution of a brain-damaged Arkansas prisoner, Rickey Ray Rector. If we look for courage in presidents, as we should, we want someone who will stand up for fairness despite political risk.

HEADLINE: Clinton Signs Final Budget Bill and Turns to Next Year

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Nov. 29

 BODY:
Nearly two months after the start of the government's fiscal year, President Clinton signed the last piece of the federal budget into law today, saying the agreement that he worked out with the Republican-led Congress had been worth the weeks of tortured negotiations.
"It is a budget for a government that lives within its means and lives up to the values of the American people," Mr. Clinton said. 
 But even as he was signing the bill, which covers $390 billion of spending on education, law enforcement, foreign aid, health care and the environment, the president was turning his attention to next year's budget and the continued political battle over apportioning projected surpluses.
Mr. Clinton held his first meeting with his aides on the administration's spending and tax proposals for next year, and he used today's bill-signing ceremony in the Rose Garden to set out an agenda for his last year in office.
"As we celebrate what we've accomplished, I ask us all to be humble and mindful of what we still have to accomplish," Mr. Clinton said as he offered a list of initiatives, including giving patients more protection in dealing with managed care companies, putting new restrictions on gun sales, bolstering Social Security's financial strength and adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare.
It is unclear how much progress Mr. Clinton and Congress will make on those and other issues in an election year. The budget fight in particular seems likely to be as hard fought as it was this year, with Republicans in Congress vowing today to pass another big tax cut over Mr. Clinton's objections and Republican presidential candidates proposing tax-cutting plans of their own.
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the front-runner in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, is expected to lay out his plan this week to reduce income tax rates, provide tax breaks for the working poor and some married couples and phase out the inheritance tax. Mr. Clinton vetoed a $792 billion, 10-year tax cut passed this summer by the Republicans, saying it would endanger the nation's newfound fiscal health.
Vice President Al Gore attacked Mr. Bush's approach today and criticized a plan by his rival for the Democratic presidential nomination, former Senator Bill Bradley, to devote a big chunk of the surplus to making health care more accessible. Both plans, Mr. Gore said, would risk plunging the government back into deficit and do nothing to address the long-term problems facing Social Security and Medicare.
"In both cases, the economic future of the country is put at risk because of higher interest rates and ignoring the lessons of the last seven years," he said in a conference call with reporters.
If there is hope for a compromise that gives both sides some of what they want despite election-year politics, it stems from the possibility that the projected budget surpluses will grow as the economy roars along and tax revenues flow into the Treasury.
"I expect the surplus projections to be up significantly," Senator Pete V. Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said as he left the White House ceremony. "We will be back next year with another major tax cut."
Both sides emerged from the standoff over this year's $1.8 trillion budget with enough of what they wanted to claim victory. Mr. Domenici said Republicans had achieved their main goal of limiting spending sufficiently to avoid dipping into the portion of the surplus generated by excess Social Security payroll taxes, an assertion that may or may not prove true depending on how quickly the surplus grows this year.
For Mr. Clinton, the legislation signed today, which rolled together five spending bills that had proved particularly difficult to pass, contained money for most of the programs he had said were his priorities. Surrounded by police officers and teachers, Mr. Clinton said the budget would help reach his goal of hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce class sizes in the early grades and would help communities hire another 50,000 police officers in neighborhoods with high crime rates.
The measure also requires federal agencies to trim their spending by 0.38 percent this year, a total of $1.2 billion. And it contains myriad provisions for special interests and narrow issues, including one authorizing but not requiring the president to provide food aid to rebels fighting the government in Sudan.
As they start planning for next year, Congress and the administration are in something of a hole. To avoid spending any of the Social Security surplus, their self-imposed standard for fiscal discipline, the two parties agreed on a number of budget gimmicks, including deferring more than $20 billion that would otherwise have been spent this year onto the next fiscal year's books.
As a result, they have that much less room to propose new spending or tax cuts for next year, having already allocated more than half of the $38 billion non-Social Security surplus projected for next year by the Congressional Budget Office.
The surplus projections themselves are in flux. Both the budget office and the White House have so far based their forecasts on the assumption that spending would remain within tight caps required by the 1997 balanced budget agreement.
But the two parties have shattered the caps for two years in a row -- by about $30 billion this year -- and future surpluses could be substantially smaller than projected if spending continues to grow faster than anticipated.
If the economy remains strong, however, the surplus for this year and next could be revised upward. And because government economists are increasingly convinced that the economy's growth potential is higher than they previously believed, they are considering increasing their economic growth estimates for the next decade, a step that would generate a corresponding increase in estimated tax revenues and therefore in the size of the surplus.

HEADLINE: Watching China's Big Board;
Beijing Backs Trade Pact but Investors Remain Wary

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Nov. 29

 BODY:
In a dark, cavernous room literally tucked under the seats of the Beijing Workers' Stadium, hundreds of Chinese spend long hours sitting on coarse wooden benches squinting to see red and green numbers march down an electronic display screen half as long as a football field.
In groups of two or three, the spectators, mostly men, chat and joke. They smoke and drink tea. Occasionally one grabs his wallet and rushes to the transaction terminals under the screen, anxious to make a purchase. 
 With its smoky haze and cement floor littered with butts, the room has the look of a subterranean Off Track Betting office. In fact, it is an office of the Beijing International Trust Investment Company and Security Exchange -- one of China's many new stock brokerage offices for the masses.
Small Chinese investors and would-be investors have been converging at such places all over China, particularly in the past couple of weeks since China and the United States signed a trade agreement that is expected to lead to China's membership in the World Trade Organization.
A slice of urban China, they have come filled with hopes and worries, theories and predictions about the economic impact of the deal, which theoretically will give foreign companies far greater access to China's markets and give Chinese companies increased opportunities to sell goods overseas.
"As soon as I heard the thing was signed I put all my money in," said Liang Yongbin, a cheerful 31-year-old chef, who stood before a screen of computer graphics at the brokerage office one recent day, studying the saw-toothed path of Chinese stock-price behavior.
Since the trade pact was signed Nov. 15, the domestic stock markets have seesawed, rising and falling on shifting opinions and rumors about winners and losers among Chinese companies.
On the eve of the 135-nation trade group's ministerial meeting in Seattle, the extreme gyrations have abated. Part of the reason may just be a broad realization that China will not officially join the trade group until sometime next year.
But for long-term investors, the more important fact is that China and the United States have a significant trade agreement that is likely to greatly expand their commercial relationship and could make some Chinese stocks very attractive several years from now. And it should lead eventually to a major overhaul of China's bloated state-owned companies, freeing up economic resources for more efficient use.
Mr. Liang said he started buying stocks -- textiles mostly -- when he first heard that the long-stalled negotiations appeared to be making progress a week or so before the pact was signed. And when prices fell sharply for some stocks just after the pact was announced, he threw in his entire fortune, buying stocks he considered undervalued.
"I think W.T.O. will have a big impact here, but I think many stock buyers in China are not experienced enough to understand it," he said. "And everyone here has a different idea."
To be sure, the behavior of the stock markets in China, which are barely a decade old, is not necessarily a reliable barometer of investor opinion or a forecaster of China's economy. Although the trade pact has been celebrated as a triumph in the state-controlled press, Chinese investors have little concrete information, since only sketchy details of the agreement have been presented in newspapers and the television news.
Immediately after news of the trade deal, many Chinese investors quickly dumped the stocks of car makers and telecommunications companies, industries they believed were poorly equipped to handle foreign competition. The two Chinese markets, one in Shanghai and the other in the southern city of Shenzhen, both fell about 1.5 percent that day.
But over the next few days the same markets surged, as the press aggressively promoted the advantages of the deal. "Investors are becoming convinced that China will gain more than its loses from W.T.O., thanks to the upbeat media coverage," an article in The China Daily said.
By the end of that week the market had fallen again, with investors -- on further reflection -- unsure. The same pattern of up one day, down the next prevailed last week as well. As of the end of today both the Shanghai and Shenzhen markets had basically returned to where they were a few weeks ago, off only about 1 percent from their closing levels the day the trade deal was signed.
Still, the hubbub on the streets of Beijing surrounding the trade deal shows how much the investment bug has infected the general populace here, which once regarded financial markets as contemptible tools of greedy capitalists.
"I came right over when I heard prices were low, and today I'm buying medicine and information stocks," Yu Xiyong, a 30-year-old in a tweed jacket who works as a clothes seller near the Beijing Workers Stadium, said one day last week as the market was falling. He explained that he hoped a W.T.O. agreement might in some way help pharmaceutical makers export their products and make more investment available to China's fledgling high-technology companies.
Despite the ups and downs, there have been some clear winners and losers.
Textiles have been almost universally seen as good buys, since the trade deal requires the United States to remove import tariffs on Chinese garments within five years. Among the biggest gainers in the days immediately after the trade deal were Shanghai's No. 3 Woolen Mill Company, partly owned by the state, which rose nearly 23 percent, and the China Garments Company, a maker of silk fabrics and artificial fur, which rose 8 percent. Shares of the Jingwei Textile Machinery Company rose more than 50 percent, though they have since relinquished much of their gain.
The Chinese automotive industry, on the other hand, suffered dearly: many of the big losers on both exchanges were companies which manufacture cars, buses or trucks. The Nanfang Motors Company, for example, which makes small and midsize cars, motorcycles and auto parts, has fallen more than 10 percent and today reached a 52-week low. The Jinan Diesel Engine Company has fallen 3 percent.
Under the trade pact, China has promised to reduce drastically its 80 to 100 percent import duties on foreign-made vehicles -- duties that have forced China's emerging middle class to choose from a rather sorry range of domestic cars.
"I sold cars and bought textiles and electronic equipment the day after the agreement," said a gnarled unemployed man in a rust-colored jacket with a cigarette hanging from his mouth, who identified himself only as Mr. Wei. He predicted that many state enterprises could go bankrupt from the effects of membership in the World Trade Organization.
In a country where information is scarce and so much of the economy is still ultimately under government control, playing the stock market requires diverse skills: scavenging for financial facts, watching corporate profits and losses and also trawling for hints of the government's intentions.
For example, when the market jumped two days after news of the trade pact, many who follow the stock market suspected that large investment companies partly owned by the state were buying stocks at the government's behest to energize a market that had initially sagged.
There are many imponderables in the Chinese stock market. And at places like the Worker's Stadium stock exchange, many people play it safe, wandering in to watch the big board rather than to buy. It is at once a stock exchange, social club for middle-aged men, gathering place for retirees.
"Everyone's purpose here is different," said Mr. Liang, the chef, who bought Internet stocks when the market slumped a week ago. "Some come here to make money, some to play."
Mr. Liang said that in the last three years he had made enough money with stocks to pay for his wedding and a small apartment. And he says that in the long term, membership in the trade organization will be good for Chinese business and stock prices will rise.
For now, he explained, "I know the stock market here is still a kind of gambling. But I'm young and earning money, so it's O.K."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Dow Off 40.99 on Worries About Fast Pace of Economy

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
Worries that the economy is showing few signs of slowing despite the efforts of the Federal Reserve swept through the bond market yesterday, pushing interest rates sharply higher. Stock prices, which have been on a torrid run, fell in sympathy.
Important reports on the economy are expected later this week, including November employment data on Friday. But as bond traders returned to work after the Thanksgiving weekend yesterday, anecdotal evidence of a strong start to the Christmas shopping season was a fresh source of concern 
 "All the early reports on Christmas have been gangbusters," said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management. "There is scant information the economy is slowing down, and the bond market is getting really nervous about that."
Selling began in the morning and continued throughout the session. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond had fallen 31/32, to 97 19/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.30 percent, from 6.23 percent on Friday. It was the worst one-day performance for the bond market in seven weeks.
Led by interest-rate sensitive financial service issues, stock prices moved lower. Technology shares, which have jumped sharply this month, moved higher early in the session, but faltered later.
"This year the market has been dominated by technology, and people are willing now to lock in some gains and get defensive going in to Y2K," said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. "The unfriendly bond market gave an excuse for investors to take profits."
At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average was down 40.99 points, or 0.37 percent, to 10,947.92. American Express, General Electric and J. P. Morgan were big contributors to the decline.
Among broader averages, the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 8.79 points, or 0.62 percent, to 1,407.83. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 26.44 points, or 0.77 percent, to 3,421.37. Nextel, Qualcomm and Intuit were among the biggest losers.
Small-company stocks also fared poorly. The Russell 2000 index slipped 1.99 points, or 0.43 percent, to 456.95.
Robert E. Turner, chairman and chief investment officer at Turner Investment Partners Inc., with $4 billion under management, said the slight decline in technology shares could prove transitory.
"Credit Suisse First Boston is sponsoring a technology conference this week, and I have to believe that many of these stocks will benefit from that," he said.
"I am pretty optimistic about tech stocks from here on out. For the most part, fourth-quarter earnings, which we won't see for another 45 days or so, are going to be pretty good."
Among financial stocks, General Electric, whose GE Capital subsidiary is the largest nonbank finance company, fell 2 1/2, to 133 1/8. American Express fell 4 13/16, to 147 13/16. J. P. Morgan dropped 2 1/16, to 131 1/2. And Bank of America, a component of the S.& P. 500, fell 3 9/16, to 56 15/16.
Among technology stocks, Intel fell 2 13/16, to 78 11/16, after Advanced Micro Devices, its biggest rival in the microprocessor market, announced a new chip that it contends is faster than Intel's most advanced design. Shares of Advanced Micro gained 1 9/16, to 29 1/4.
Investors took profits in Qualcomm. The stock fell 13 13/16, to 371 3/16. Since Nov. 17, Qualcomm stock had risen 12 percent.
America Online, another good performer recently, fell 2 7/8, to 80 1/16.
Nextel dropped 3, to 90. And Intuit shed 7 3/16, to 52 1/16.
Drug stocks were among the day's winners.
Johnson & Johnson, a Dow component, gained 1 7/8, to 105 5/16. Pfizer was up 1 7/16, to 37 7/16. Eli Lilly gained 3 1/16, to 75 3/8. And Warner-Lambert rose 2 3/8, to 91 3/8.
AT&T gained 2 7/16 to 59 7/8, after a Salomon Smith Barney analyst raised his rating on the telephone company to "buy" from "neutral."
And early reports about strong holiday sales helped retailers.
Gap gained 2 7/16, to 41 3/8. Best Buy jumped 8 3/4, to 66 5/8. And Circuit City rose 3/8, to 50 5/8.
Results of yesterday's Treasury auctions of 3-month and 6-month bills follow:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

	 	 	3-Mo. Bills	6-Mo. Bills	 	Price	98.686	97.305	High Rate	5.20%	5.33%	Coupon Yield	5.35%	5.57%	Low Rate	5.09%	5.24%	Median Rate	5.18%	5.32%	Total applied for	$30,698,461	$32,430,533	Accepted	$13,068,561	$12,367,741	Noncompetitive	$1,283,048	$1,061,926

HEADLINE: Cuban Government Enters Fight for Boy

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: MIAMI, Nov. 29

 BODY:
The father of a 5-year-old Cuban boy who drifted in the Atlantic Ocean for two days on an inner tube before he was rescued on Thanksgiving Day has enlisted the aid of the Cuban government in seeking his child's custody.
According to reports from Havana, Elian Gonzalez's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and Cuban government officials have lodged complaints with American diplomats in Havana accusing Elian's mother of kidnapping the boy. The mother, who was divorced from Mr. Gonzalez, was among 13 people who had packed themselves into a 17-foot aluminum boat in an effort to flee Cuba. She is believed to have been killed along with nine others when the boat capsized on the 90-mile journey to Florida. 
 While immigration lawyers say surviving parents are normally awarded custody, this case has been complicated by the tensions between the United States and Cuba. Immigration officials said that they had fulfilled their responsibilities and that Elian would be eligible to apply to become a permanent resident after a year and a day. The boy is staying in Miami with relatives of his father, and immigration officials said that unless the families could work out their differences the matter would be decided by a judge.
Relatives said Mr. Gonzalez, a doorman at a tourist hotel in the resort town of Varadero, had agreed to let Elian stay in Miami. But in a Cuban news program last night, Mr. Gonzalez was reported to have said he did not give permission for his child to be taken away. "If the United States is such a country of human rights, they should return my child," he said on the broadcast.
In a statement released Sunday, the Cuban Foreign Ministry said it had begun to draft documents needed to obtain the child's return. The ministry blamed the United States for what it called stupid immigration policies under the Cuban Adjustment Act that grant asylum to refugees who set foot on American soil.
"It is on the government of the United States that the responsibility falls entirely for these new and painful deaths of Cuban citizens," the statement said. "Because of the unreasonable way in which that country promotes, stimulates and rewards illegal immigration."
James Rubin, a State Department spokesman, rebutted the Cuban accusations today, saying the American government did not condone illegal immigration from Cuba.
"It is reprehensible that anyone would suggest the U.S. is responsible in any way for these tragic deaths," Mr. Rubin said. "We stay strong in our commitment to encourage safe, legal and orderly migration and urge individuals in Cuba to refrain from attempting to migrate illegally."
In an interview with The Associated Press, Mr. Gonzalez said he would be willing to travel to the United States to claim his son. Spencer Eig, a lawyer representing Elian, said he hoped the father would come to the United States, although for other reasons.
"After what Elian has been through, the last thing he needs is more conflict," Mr. Eig said. "We are hoping the United States government takes a humanitarian approach and allows the boy to stay as a Cuban refugee. I also think it would be helpful if they make it possible for his father to visit him here. He would see how wonderfully his son is adjusting to life."
Mr. Gonzalez would also see how his son had become a symbol beyond a mere custody fight. While such battles have always had the potential for contentiousness, this one has the added element of international squabbling and exile politics.
Elian has become a poster boy for the Cuban American National Foundation, an influential lobbying group. The foundation has printed 4,000 posters that feature a picture of Elian under the caption: "Another Child Victim of Fidel Castro."
"He is a heroic boy," Mr. Eig said. "He is perhaps the last hero in the 20th century battle against totalitarianism."
David Abraham, a professor of immigration law at the University of Miami, said the politically and emotionally charged themes swirling around the custody case could obscure the basic issues.
"It is sad, because the Cuban American National Foundation is using this boy as a poster child of immigration to demonstrate the tyranny of the Cuban regime," Mr. Abraham said. "They're saying it's forcing even 5-year-olds to leave the country, but he is a personal victim of these tragedies. He lost a parent, and now he's in a situation because his father is still in Cuba. These tragedies are the result of the failure of both countries to regulate immigration normally."
The failure to do so, combined with Cuban unhappiness over the island's economic and political climate, have also led to an increase in rafters trying to enter the United States. A Coast Guard spokesman said 1,265 Cuban immigrants were picked up this year, doubling last year's total.
Max Castro, a senior research associate at the North-South Center at the University of Miami, said the refugee flow was spurred by a belief among Cubans that they could expect little change from their government.
"The idea of rebelling against the government is not something they believe in or can see," Mr. Castro said. "They do not see that as something imminent. So what do they do? As perilous as it is, the softest wall in this equation is the wall of the sea."
He added that both Cuba and the United States could take measures to allow for easier immigration and improved economic opportunities for the Cuban people.
"All the players could do things to ease the situation," Mr. Castro said. "But it is at an impasse and the people are getting crushed. What they look at as the best option, at least some people, will lead inevitably to more tragedies like this. But nobody wants to say 'Uncle.' "

HEADLINE: 3 Airlines Reverse Course on Raising Fares, for Now

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
A 3 percent rise in air fares last week was quietly rolled back when American Airlines, Continental Airlines and United Airlines threw in the towel -- American on Sunday, Continental and United yesterday. But analysts say that sooner or later, probably sooner, the airlines will try to raise fares again.
The cancellation appeared almost inevitable when Delta Air Lines, which had followed American's lead in raising fares eight days ago, decided on Thursday to rescind its raise "to remain competitive." 
 That was an apparent reference to the refusal by Northwest Airlines, US Airways, Trans World Airlines and America West Airlines to go along with the increase.
The about-face by Delta, the third- biggest airline, put pressure on United, the unit of the UAL Corporation that is the leading carrier; American, the AMR Corporation unit that is No. 2; and Continental, No. 5, to reverse as well.
The airlines attributed the proposed increases to the higher cost of aviation fuel, their biggest expense after labor. A spokesman for American Airlines said yesterday that the 3 percent fare rise was intended to help offset a fuel-cost increase of 15 percent in the third quarter over the same period in 1998.
That increase, he said, resulted in a $456 million fuel bill for the quarter, up from about $400 million in the same period last year.
Kevin Murphy, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, said: "With profits expected to be down 20 to 30 percent this year, mostly because of fuel costs, you would figure it would be easy to pass on part of the fuel increase. What the cancellation shows is that this is an industry that still cannot cover its cost of capital or adopt rational pricing, even in a strong economy."
Still, analysts said, expect the carriers to return to the issue. "Higher fuel prices impact airlines across the board, so to the extent that you see oil at elevated levels for an extended period of time, we'll certainly see airlines come back with another increase," Sam Buttrick, an analyst for Paine Webber, said.
David Swierenga, the chief economist of the Air Transport Association, the industry's trade group, said that although there have been several substantial fare increases this year, "Passengers are paying eight-tenths of 1 percent less this year than a year ago, because they have shopped for better bargains."
Mr. Buttrick agreed, saying that while posted leisure fares are up 15 percent this year, the actual fare paid is down almost 1 percent. "Posted fares are increasingly irrelevant," he added, "as leisure and business travelers shop for and find lower fares, aided by the Internet."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
In the Seesaw of Currencies, the Dollar Stands Tall in the Middle

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
ONE constant of financial markets is that they regularly defy expectations. It means that losers can be winners, analysts are caught off guard and explanations of what is occurring must sometimes be given with a shrug of the shoulders.
These are all features of the newest leg of the Japanese yen's rally against the dollar and the euro's plunge against both the dollar and the yen. 
 Easiest to explain is how the dollar can be strong against the euro at the same time it is weak against the yen. The dollar's weakness is a product of what is going on in Japan, not in the United States, while the dollar's strength has more to do with worries about Europe.
Over all, this means that the dollar's stumble against the yen is not as serious as this year's 10 percent slide might imply. In trading yesterday, the yen shrugged off intervention by the Bank of Japan intended to weaken it and finished the day at 102.35 to the dollar, slightly shy of the four-year high of 101.10 it set Friday, when American markets closed early on the day after Thanksgiving.
But the euro plunged further yesterday, setting new lows against both the dollar and the yen. At $1.0095, the euro is down from $1.0156 on Friday and almost at parity with the dollar; the euro finished at 103.50 yen yesterday. For the year, the euro is down 13.5 percent against the dollar and 21.8 percent against the yen.
The world's three major currencies are now close to a numerical parity never seen in the currency markets: 100 yen to the dollar and one dollar to the euro. At least that makes currency conversions simple.
"The yen should not be as strong as it is now, but it is," mused David Gilmore, a partner in Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. "And the euro should not be as weak as it is now, but it is."
Signals that currency traders would usually watch closely are having little impact. The yen is strengthening despite the presence of some negative economic signals, including weak Japanese household spending in the third quarter. The euro is falling even though new data show the French and German economies on upward paths.
What seems to be more critical to these currency moves is a volatile year-end environment. That climate is partly influenced by worries about Year 2000 computer problems and partly by money managers who are fleeing bad bets they made on the euro or are rushing to the Japanese stock market in the hope that it remains a good bet.
"Flows caused by the Y2K phenomenon will dominate the market," said Michael Rosenberg, head of global foreign exchange research at Deutsche Bank. "The volume of trading is not what it normally is." This contributes to his sense that the dollar's decline against the yen and the euro's slide against both the yen and dollar have "a feel of free fall."
In this environment, Karen E. Parker, director of currency research at Chase Securities, said: "if you are overweight the euro, a little bit of bad news is given a lot of weight while good news is ignored. And Japan is the mirror image; a bit of good news is given a lot of weight and bad news is ignored."
Mr. Rosenberg thinks that in the months ahead the dollar will rebound against the yen and the euro will rise against the dollar. But he said money managers who agree with that outlook would not make such bets in this environment. They are not willing, he said, to take the risk of a 2 percent or 3 percent loss now for the chance of a 10 percent gain later next year.
Many investors bet on the euro, the currency of 11 European countries, when it was introduced in January, Ms. Parker noted. And they lost badly as the euro fell close to parity with the dollar in July. But they bet on it again as it rallied up to $1.0894 by mid-October. In the swoon since, she said, they have fled faster than they did during the euro's first slide.
She said that European monetary officials were also hurting the euro by creating confusion regarding the euro's importance to their policies. Last week, the president of the European Central Bank, Wim Duisenberg, said he was not worried about the euro's decline. Yesterday, he said intervention to support the euro was a possibility.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany may also have worried investors about his nation's commitment to restructuring its economy both by inveighing against Vodafone AirTouch's proposed hostile takeover of Mannesmann A.G., and by arranging a $2.2 billion bailout of Germany's leading builder, Philipp Holzmann A.G.
As for Japan, 10 interventions since June by the Bank of Japan, including the action yesterday, have failed to weaken the yen, both because the central bank refuses to use more radical means to weaken the currency and because investors -- most of whom had been out of Japan for years -- want back in. "Investors are looking for value and are finding it in the Japanese stock market," Mr. Gilmore said.
So far this year, the Nikkei index of 225 issues is up 50 percent in dollar terms; the Topix index of more than 1,300 stocks is up 72 percent.
Some analysts thought that a stronger yen would make Japanese exports more expensive abroad and thus hurt sales, undermining the economic boomlet Japan has seen this year and stopping the stock rally. But the yen has risen 8.5 percent since Sept. 8 against the dollar, and the Nikkei has climbed 6.9 percent in that time.
As analysts pondered the currency moves, Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said yesterday that the Clinton administration still favored a strong dollar. "Our policy with respect to the dollar is unchanged: A strong dollar is in the national interest," he told reporters, according to Reuters. "As always, we are watching developments in currency markets."
All this leaves forecasters thinking that the trend will continue in the near term, with the yen moving to an exchange rate of less than 100 to the dollar while the euro drops to less than $1 as well. So currency conversions could get more difficult.

HEADLINE: Trade Talks Start in Seattle Despite a Few Disruptions

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK 

DATELINE: SEATTLE, Nov. 29

 BODY:
A week of talks aimed at expanding global trade got off to something well short of a smooth start here today. The disruptions included a brief bomb scare, the smashing of a window in protests at a McDonald's restaurant and a takeover of a vacant three-story building by a self-described group of anarchists.
In the main, though, the protests against the meeting of the World Trade Organization were peaceful, with 2,000 demonstrators marching through downtown to proclaim their view that the trade group, in the name of lowering trade barriers, actually undermines health, safety and environmental protections. 
 Demonstrators continued to stream into town, and a much larger protest, backed by union groups and timed to coincide with the official opening of the trade talks, is expected on Tuesday. Chanting, "Hey, hey, ho, ho, the W.T.O. has got to go!" many protesters said they had traveled here to spread a message that globalization and unfettered free trade were simply bad for the planet.
"The boat's off course, and everyone knows it," said Arthur Freyer, 49, an electrician and a member of the Sierra Club, who marched today. "If we can't decide what's going into our own food anymore, then something's very wrong."
The director general of the trade organization, Mike Moore, a former prime minister of New Zealand, at a meeting of some protest groups today, said the opposition was misguided. Free trade brings prosperity that, he said, could address some of the very problems the groups were complaining about.
"I am told there could be up to 50,000 demonstrators against us" on Tuesday, Mr. Moore said. "But remember, in over 30 countries, 1.5 billion want to join the W.T.O."
He was describing those nations, including China, that have applied to join the organization.
Delegates from 135 nations are meeting here hoping to hammer out an agenda to lower tariffs and remove other trade barriers.
A search of the downtown convention center, the main site for the talks, was conducted early this morning by the Secret Service and the Seattle police. It was set off by what the police described, without elaboration, as a "possible security breach." The search kept several hundred delegates out of the building and forced the rescheduling or cancellation of briefings planned by several countries. No bombs were found.
Outside a McDonald's five blocks from the convention hall, protesters cheered as Jose Bove, a French farmer who drew worldwide attention this year when he was arrested for driving a tractor through a McDonald's in France, condemned bioengineered and genetically altered food as "Frankenfoods." "We don't want to eat any more of that kind of food," Mr. Bove told the crowd. "You've got to throw it into the sea."
The restaurant was closed as a precaution, and one person was arrested after a window was smashed. Elsewhere downtown, two other people, whose names were not released, were arrested on charges of assault and obstruction after they had tried to break through a police cordon and serve "arrest warrants" on officials of the trade group.
President Clinton is scheduled to arrive here early on Wednesday morning, and he is expected to use his visit to promote the benefits of free trade and to prod delegates to smooth out disagreements and listen to the protesters' concerns.
Several administration officials, including the trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky; Commerce Secretary William M. Daley; and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, spent much of the day in forums where they heard the complaints of nongovernmental groups that have called for reform of the international trading system to incorporate stronger protections for workers and the environment.
"It's important that the views of civil society be heard," Ms. Barshefsky said at a news conference. "But more than heard, they must be integrated into the W.T.O."
Mr. Clinton had tried and failed to persuade other world leaders to go to the meeting in an effort to advance trade agreements. The only other national leader who said he might just go was one whom the President presumably did not wish to see in Seattle, President Fidel Castro of Cuba. But Mr. Castro announced today in Havana that he would not make the trip.

Medical Device Research Mixes With Profit Motive
In the world of medical devices, the lines between inventors, researchers, promoters and investors are often nonexistent. Rare is the truly disinterested researcher, with no stake in the outcome of a study. It is a phenomenon found in every medical treatment using devices, from laser surgery to gene therapy.
Scientists on the front line of such medical research, whose work can help determine treatment options for countless Americans, often can earn vast wealth so long as their results are positive. It is an immense financial pressure that would be unacceptable in any other field of medical research. Page A1. 

Editor Named at George Magazine
Undaunted by the prospect and challenges of stepping into a role established by John F. Kennedy Jr., Frank Lalli, left, a former managing editor of Money magazine, has agreed to take over as editor in chief of George magazine. Jack W. Kliger, the chief executive of Hachette-Filipacchi Magazines, said he waited several months to hire an editor because he wanted to do so only after Hachette had bought out the Kennedy family's 50 percent stake in the magazine, which the company did in October. C2.
 
Some Airlines Halt 3% Fare Increase
A 3 percent increase in air fares last week was quietly rolled back when American Airlines, Continental Airlines and United Airlines threw in the towel over the last couple of days. But analysts say that sooner or later, the airlines will try to raise fares again. C2.
 
Stocks Fall as Bond Yields Jump
Worries that the economy is showing few signs of slowing swept through the bond market, pushing long-term interest rates sharply higher, with the yield on the 30-year issue climbing to 6.30 percent from 6.23 percent. Stock prices fell. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 40.99 points, to 10,947.92. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 8.79 points, to 1,407.83. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 26.44 points, to 3,421.37. C14.
 
Demonstrations at W.T.O. Meeting
A week of trade talks by the World Trade Organization in Seattle began with disruptions that included a bomb scare, the smashing of a window during protests at a McDonald's restaurant, and a takeover of a vacant three-story building by a group of self-described anarchists. Over all, though, the protests against the trade meeting were peaceful. A14.
 
Mannesmann Begins Its Defense
Fighting the largest hostile-takeover attempt ever made, Klaus Esser, chief executive of Mannesmann of Germany, began a defense against Vodafone AirTouch, arguing that the $127.7 billion bid was too low. C18.
 
Oil Transporter Warns of Losses
Plains All American Pipeline, a partnership that transports and sells oil in the South and West, said that unauthorized crude oil trading by an employee was expected to cause $160 million in losses and was forcing the company to renegotiate credit agreements. The partnership said that its 1999 operating earnings would be lower and that past profits might have to be restated. Units of the partnership fell $9.125, or 47 percent, to $10.375. C2.
 
Board Approves Unions at Hospitals
In a decision that could lead to improved working conditions for overworked hospital interns and residents, the National Labor Relations Board ruled that interns and residents at privately owned hospitals have the right to form unions under federal law. A16.
 
Existing Home Sales Decline 6.6%
Sales of existing homes fell 6.6 percent in October to their lowest level in almost two years, an industry survey showed, signaling that one of the forces behind the near-record United States expansion has started to cool. C14.
 
President Clinton Signs Budget
Nearly two months after the start of the government's fiscal year, President Clinton signed the last piece of the federal budget into law, saying the agreement that he worked out with the Republican-led Congress had been worth the weeks of negotiations. A20.

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS 

 BODY:
This Thursday, George W. Bush is going to emerge from his burrow and take part in a debate with the other Republican presidential candidates in New Hampshire. Unless, of course, he sees his shadow. In that case we will have six more weeks of autumn, during which the governor of Texas will have to stay home and squire his wife to more awards ceremonies.
Presuming Mr. Bush does finally make an appearance, you'll notice that he and Senator John McCain are sharing the stage with a number of strange men you've never seen before. This is the Republican Field, and it consists of: 
 Senator Orrin Hatch. You may remember Mr. Hatch reading "The Exorcist" at the Clarence Thomas hearings, and suggesting that Anita Hill's story had been cooked up by "slick lawyers" from the left.
The characteristics that separate Mr. Hatch from the herd include a tendency to refer to himself in the third person, and to call campaign donations "monies." As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he argues that he is best qualified to nominate new federal judges. There are quite a few of those jobs to fill since, under Mr. Hatch, the Judiciary confirmation pipeline has become more of a clogged drain.
Alan Keyes, a radio talk-show host, is referred to as "Ambassador" in reference to his work as the Reagan administration's representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council, an organization he nostalgically refers to as that "rat hole of United Nations waste." His only election victory has been in the race for president of the Ronald Reagan Alumni Association.
In debate, Mr. Keyes provides the critical function of scaring the audience into wakefulness. "We proliferate laws!" he told a woman in Hanover who had only asked about the war on drugs. "We even have started to invade property rights and do other things that are tearing down our system of liberty! Why? Because we are out of control!"
Steve Forbes. Sometimes a candidate comes along who can unite all Americans -- rich, poor, young, old, black and white -- behind a single thought. Mr. Forbes is such a man, and his unending race for the presidency has caused the entire nation to join together and calculate all the better ways they could have found to spend $54 million of their own money.
Recent history demonstrates that Americans don't like incredibly rich candidates who want to start at the top, but Mr. Forbes just keeps spending along. He takes pride in the way his signature issue, the flat-tax plan, has gotten support from other Republicans. That's because "flat" sounds like a synonym for "low." Rename it the "no-mortgage-deduction tax plan" and see how far it flies.
Gary Bauer is yet another of the Republican candidates who have prepared for the presidency by never being elected to anything. The head of conservative lobbying groups, Mr. Bauer worked for the Reagan administration as under secretary of education. In what may be an effort to differentiate himself from Mr. Keyes, Mr. Bauer says that the bureaucrats working for him were "good people," albeit misguided.
With a crowd this large, Mr. Bush is not going to have much trouble with the debates. He'll get a 15-minute rest between questions, and it will be hard for the audience to hear him anyway, with Alan Keyes ringing in their ears.
Personally, I'd like a more exclusive format -- say a debate limited to candidates whose name you can connect to "President" without causing your hearers to break into laughter or faint dead away. But nobody is leaving without a fight. Mr. Keyes and Mr. Bauer, who travel very light, seem to regard campaigning as a career. Mr. Forbes treats it the way his father collected Faberge eggs and yachts -- as a hobby whose very expense makes it more desirable. Mr. Hatch, who is running simultaneously for his Senate seat, also seems optimistic. "In January, when voters start focusing on the race, they're going to say: 'Hey, what about Orrin Hatch?' " predicted the senator's campaign spokesman.
In a way, it just shows you what a great country this is. Any middle-aged man in America can decide he will grow up to be president, despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

HEADLINE: Russia Discloses Details of Its Former Chemical Arms Program

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER 

 BODY:
Not long after Congress cut American assistance to Russian programs aimed at destroying chemical weapons stockpiles, Russia has disclosed new details about its former chemical weapons program.
In an article published on Monday in a magazine of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the Hague-based international agency that oversees the 1993 treaty banning chemical weapons, three Russian officials said Russia had 24 former poison gas factories, 6 of which it plans to destroy, and 18 of which it has either converted to peaceful use or intends to convert, rather than destroy. 
 The Russians also appealed in their article in the magazine Synthesis for financial aid for their chemical weapons destruction and conversion program, as well as international blessing for their desire to convert 10 of the 18 factories.
Government and private chemical weapons experts called the article the first detailed public description of Russia's former chemical weapons factories, its plans for them and the cost of such plans.
The disclosures come on the eve of a meeting of the 41-member executive council of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, which was founded to monitor the carrying out of the treaty ratified by more than 125 nations, including the United States and Russia. Council approval is needed for Russia's request to convert, rather than destroy, the former chemical weapons factories, and it will then need approval by the organization's full assembly, set to meet next May.
The article asserts that because Russia can afford only 10 percent of the $110 million required to demilitarize its former poison gas factories, "financial assistance from other countries is crucial."
"The rate of submission of the relevant documentation to the O.P.C.W., and consequently, of the destruction and conversion of the facilities, will depend on the financial resources available," say the authors. They are Svetlana Utkina, the division head of the National Scientific Center of the State Institute on Organic Chemistry and Technology; Aleksandr Gorbovsky, a department head of the Russian Agency on Munitions, and Aleksandr Zhuchkov, a department chief at the Russian Ministry of Economy.
The officials also say destroying rather than converting the factories, some of which are already engaged in peaceful production, would cost Russia up to a $1 billion in lost revenue, which it can ill afford.
Russia has privately shared this kind of information about its former chemical arms program with the prohibition organization, as the treaty and agreements with the United States require. Washington has spent roughly $150 million helping Russia to destroy and convert such factories. But Moscow has been reluctant to discuss details of the poison gas factories or plans for them.
In addition, the Russian government has repeatedly denied assertions by Soviet defectors and American officials that it developed and tested a new class of highly lethal chemical weapons. These so-called binary weapons, in which two chemical agents become lethal when joined in a munition, are called novichuk, which in Russian means "new guy."
Russia has grown more willing to discuss certain aspects of its conversion and destruction programs as its concerns about financing them have mounted. Last week, Congress eliminated all funds to help Russia build a pilot plan to destroy its nerve agent-filled munitions at Shchuchye, where 13.6 percent of the Russian stockpile is stored.
"These weapons aren't going to destroy themselves," said Amy E. Smithson, senior associate at the Henry L. Stimson Center, in Washington. "If the Pentagon want to ensure that U.S. troops never encounter this stuff on a battlefield, it will have to persuade Congress to resume funding chemical weapons destruction assistance for Russia."
In their article, the Russian officials said equipment that could make chemical weapons had already been removed from 8 of the 18 factories scheduled for conversion. But considerable foreign aid would be required to demilitarize the remaining 10, which had been used to produce sarin, soman and their precursors, the authors said.

HEADLINE: The Future of Trade, According to Gates

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In his Nov. 29 Op-Ed article about the World Trade Organization, Bill Gates argues that removing trade barriers is a great boon to the United States and the world, and that the W.T.O. is the entity to lead the effort. 
 However, as Mr. Gates noted, the W.T.O. seeks to increase protection for intellectual property claims like copyrights and patents. These forms of protectionism are enormously costly to developing nations, raising prices of some goods by several hundred or even several thousand percent. And when patent protection involves vital drugs, it could cost lives.
The W.T.O. also seeks to make Internet commerce tax-free, an idea for which there is no economic or ethical justification. In short, the W.T.O. agenda is clearly designed to help big corporations like Microsoft, to the detriment of much of the world's population.

HEADLINE: The Future of Trade, According to Gates

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Bill Gates's view of world trade (Op-Ed, Nov. 29) is self-serving. Those of us working outside of Silicon Valley and Redmond, Wash., have real fears about being left out of the World Trade Organization negotiations. Workers in manufacturing are at the mercy of developing nations as they try to export their way into prosperity through the United States' markets. 
 The W.T.O. agreements will increase both the number of manufacturing companies and the amount of capital investment leaving the United States. Most factories remain modern for 10 to 15 years, so we may not have a chance to regain that investment and job base for all that time. Manufacturing jobs should not be sacrificed to increase high-tech software sales or export more farm products.

HEADLINE: SCIENTIST AT WORK: MARK J. PLOTKIN;
A Romance With a Rain Forest and Its Elusive Miracles

BYLINE: By JON CHRISTENSEN 

 BODY:
It has the makings of a good story and Dr. Mark J. Plotkin clearly relishes the beginning. If only it had a happy ending.
Deep in the Amazon jungle, on a prospecting mission for Shaman Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Plotkin was living out the romantic dream of every scientist who studies how people use plants. The company had staked millions of dollars on finding a breakthrough drug by sending ethnobotanists like Dr. Plotkin to confer with shamans in the rain forest and bring back promising plants. Adding poignancy to the quest, Dr. Plotkin was searching for plants to treat diabetes, which had killed his grandmothers. 
 Dr. Plotkin described the symptoms to a medicine man from the Sikiyana-Chikena tribe: sores between the toes, incessant thirst, fading eyesight. He then followed the shaman into the forest and watched him pick a trailside herb, peel long strips of bark from a towering tree and drain sap from a twisted vine. Back at the village, he boiled all the ingredients together in a clay pot over a wood fire. That night, the shaman gave the thick reddish-brown liquid to a young Indian woman with a nearly fatal case of diabetes. The next morning her blood sugar level was almost normal. Within a few days she was well enough to work in her garden again.
"I was knocked over," Dr. Plotkin said. "He literally raised that woman from the dead."
Alas, the medicine did not pan out back in the lab at Shaman Pharmaceuticals in South San Francisco. And when the Food and Drug Administration sent the company's most promising new drug prospect, a diarrhea remedy from an Amazon tree, back for more clinical trials, Shaman Pharmaceuticals' stock slid until it was virtually worthless. In February 1999, the company abandoned the quest to make drugs from rain forest remedies and decided to sell dietary supplements instead.
Dr. Plotkin has since severed his ties with the company, which has changed its name to ShamanBotanicals.com. He also had the company remove every reference to his name from its Web site. He renounced bioprospecting, the search for medicines and other useful products, because it had become too controversial in South America, where indigenous tribes had complained that bioprospectors were stealing their secrets and getting rich from them. Dr. Plotkin said the idea that bioprospectors were profiting from Indian knowledge also hindered his ability to raise money for his own nonprofit organization, the Amazon Conservation Team, which works with shamans in Colombia and other countries to preserve their knowledge.
For Dr. Plotkin, 44, this falling out represented a career crisis, although he played down its significance. His experience is emblematic of the changes that have occurred in a field in which old-fashioned botanists once toiled in obscurity until saving the rain forest became a cause celebre, and ethnobotanists like Dr. Plotkin linked their fortunes to the pharmaceutical industry, only to discover that medical miracles are rare, even in the rain forest.
Dr. Plotkin had built his reputation on the claim that the rain forest was a pharmacy filled with wonder drugs known to traditional healers who were eager to share their knowledge. Shaman Pharmaceuticals was one of many companies that wanted to find the proof and help provide a financial incentive to save the rain forest.
"We all had a mantra that we had to save the rain forest because it was a repository of natural drugs," said Dr. Wade Davis, who studied ethnobotany at Harvard and watched Dr. Plotkin's rapid rise.
Dr. Plotkin had followed a roundabout path to the rain forest. The son of a Jewish shoe salesman in a poor black neighborhood in New Orleans, he dropped out of the University of Pennsylvania's biology department after less than a year because he was more interested in studying whole organisms than cells and microbes. He went to Cambridge and got a job unpacking specimens at the Harvard Zoological Museum, and went to night school through the university's extension program. He went on to study at Yale and Tufts and worked as a research associate at the Harvard Botanical Museum under Dr. Richard Evans Schultes, who inspired Dr. Plotkin and others with his tales of Indian ceremonies and hallucinogenic potions. "If you can't interest people in rain forests, hallucinogenic plants, and naked people," Dr. Schultes liked to say, "then you're in the wrong line of business."
For his doctoral research, Dr. Plotkin cataloged the medicinal plants of the Tirio tribe in Suriname. At the same time, he began carving out a career away from the academic world as an environmental activist working for Conservation International and the World Wildlife Fund.
Both organizations were eager to publicize the exploits of the dashing young ethnobotanist who was working with Indians to discover medicines and save the rain forest. His reputation was cemented in a 1989 Smithsonian magazine cover story that showed Dr. Plotkin in face paint and an Indian ceremonial headdress deep in the Amazon. Profile writers have compared him to Indiana Jones, and quoted sympathetic colleagues who called Dr. Plotkin the Carl Sagan of the rain forest. But there have also been strong undercurrents of skepticism about his showmanship and his affection for feathers and fame over peer reviewed science, where his record is thin.
"He's doing great stuff educating people and trying to save indigenous knowledge," said a former colleague, Dr. Tom Carlson, vice president for medical ethnobotany of the company ShamanBotanicals.com. "But in terms of rigorous ethnobotanical science, very little of his work was useful. And a lot of that had to do with sloppy research."
As an example Dr. Carlson cites the story of the putative diabetes cure. Dr. Plotkin, he said, did not actually measure the patient's blood sugar level before the shaman administered the potion in the Amazon, and the plant specimens he sent back were poorly preserved and incorrectly labeled.
Moreover, although Dr. Plotkin concluded that that the plants he sent back from the jungle showed no effects in laboratory tests, Dr. Carlson said that two of the plants did lower blood sugar in tests with mice, just not enough to justify further research.
The company, Dr. Carlson said, is developing a line of glucose-lowering snacks for diabetics. But not with Dr. Plotkin's plants.
Dr. Plotkin admits that he has been less than prolific in the scientific realm of enthnobotany. He said he had not shared his findings or contributed many plant collections to museums, the hallmark of a botany career in colleagues' eyes, because he does not want people to search his writings or botanical collections for clues to Indian medicines."My trust with the Indians is more important," he said.
It was the increasing distrust of scientists among the Indians, in addition to the failure of the diabetes remedy, and the crash of Shaman Pharmaceuticals that finally made Dr. Plotkin give up on bioprospecting. . But he is sticking with the shamans.
In October, Dr. Plotkin brought a group of Colombian shamans to the United States to protest scientific research on their plant knowledge without their consent. Draped in necklaces of bright beads, jungle seeds and jaguar claws, the shamans met with activists and donors across the country. They presented a statement condemning "anthropologists, botanists, physicians and other scientists who are conducting experiments with yage and other medicinal and sacred plants without taking into account our ancestral wisdom and our collective intellectual property rights."
But on this trip, unlike others, Dr. Plotkin did not take the shamans to meet with any pharmaceutical companies.
Some colleagues say Dr. Plotkin has contributed to an atmosphere of distrust by promoting the potential for finding profitable medicines in the Amazon, and then by joining the debate about property rights and royalties for products that have yet to pan out, even in the lab.
Of course, Dr. Plotkin is not the only one responsible for the heavy promotion of the curative potential of the rain forest. Dr. Davis said he also played a role. "But the rhetoric ran away from reality," Dr. Davis said. "And the whole thing has backfired. We have not found new drugs. And the fact that the idea is deeply flawed is never questioned."
In retrospect, it is pretty clear why the hypothesis was wrong, Dr. Davis said. The field had already been closely scrutinized. The Indians do know the forest after thousands of years of screening plants for medicinal properties, he said. But newcomers, starting with the Spanish conquistadors, quickly picked up the most obviously efficacious and economically valuable medicines, like coca, the basis for cocaine, the antimalarial medicine quinine, and the arrow poison curare, which is the basis for a muscle relaxant used in surgery.
Although his own bioprospecting venture was a failure, Dr. Plotkin still believes in the magic of shamanism and the potential for new drugs. But if the idea ever does pay off, Dr. Plotkin will not be part of it. He is working with South American shamans to encourage them to preserve their sacred methods of healing.
Dr. Plotkin now argues that his experience with the diabetes remedy illustrates the limitations of what he calls a reductionist approach: breaking the traditional jungle medicine into its chemical constituents to test it in a modern laboratory. Perhaps the medicine works more like a magic shotgun blast, he said, than a magic bullet. "When they couldn't reproduce it in the lab, it brought me up short," he said. "But when I went back to the jungle and saw the woman was still alive, it said to me, well, maybe the lab can't do everything it needs to do."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 14, 1999, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times on Nov. 30 about Dr. Mark Plotkin, an ethnobotanist, referred imprecisely to ShamanBotanicals.com, a company with which he has been associated. The company, originally named Shaman Pharmaceuticals, has shifted its emphasis from pharmaceuticals to dietary supplements based on rain forest products; it has not abandoned its goals of deriving remedies from the rain forest.
The article also referred incompletely to the role of Dr. Plotkin in testing the effects of rain forest medicines on an Indian woman. Dr. Plotkin was accompanied by a physician who was responsible for drawing blood for medical tests. Dr. Plotkin did not draw blood.
